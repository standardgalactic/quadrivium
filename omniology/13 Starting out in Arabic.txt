Lesson 1: Essential expressions
marHaba! Welcome! In this ﬁ rst lesson of your Arabic audio course, you’ll learn how to greet people and 
how to introduce yourself to someone. You’ll also learn some basics of Arabic pronunciation. First, let’s 
get started with some vocabulary. You’ll hear the words and phrases in English ﬁ rst and then in the Arabic. 
Repeat each new word or phrase in the pauses provided every time you hear it. Ready?

VOCABULARY BUILDING 1
Yes.  
na‘am.
No. [Not at all./By no means.] 
kalla.
Hello. 
ahlan.
Good morning. 
Sab∫H  al- khayr.
Good evening. 
mas∫’  al- khayr.
Please. (to a man) 
min faDlak.
Of course. 
Taba‘an.
Good- bye. 
ma‘a s- sal∫ma.
TAKE A BREAK 1
Okay, let’s stop there for a moment. You learned how to say some important basic words, such as yes 
(na‘am), no (kalla), hello (ahlan), good morning (Sab∫H  al- khayr), good evening (masaa’  al- khayr), 
please (min faDlak), of course (Taba‘an), and  good- bye (ma‘a s- sal∫ma). Did you notice that there are 
many sounds in Arabic that  don’t have equivalents in English? Many Arabic sounds are pronounced in the 
back of the  throat— na‘am (yes), ahlan (hello), Sab∫H  al- khayr (good morning), mas∫’  al- khayr (good 
evening), min faDlak (please), Taba‘an (of course), and  ma’as- sal∫ma  (good- bye)—and are therefore best 
learned through careful listening and repetition. For example: na’am, Taba‘an and  ma‘as- sal∫ma all have 
the sound a‘a in them; Sab∫H  al- khayr and mas∫’  al- khayr have the sound kh in khayr, and Sab∫H in 
Sab∫H  al- khayr has the sound H. You will hear these sounds in many words as you learn more Arabic 
vocabulary.
Did you notice the word al in Sab∫H  al- khayr (good morning)? This word is the equivalent of the English 
deﬁ nite article the, but the Arabic al is pronounced as part of the word that follows it. For example, in the 
greetings above, the word khayr (good) is pronounced together with the deﬁ nite article al— al- khayr. 
Often, the l in al blends into the word that follows it and “doubles” the ﬁ rst consonant of the following 
word, making it sound stronger, as in ma‘as- sal∫ma ( good- bye), where the article is pronounced as s, 
doubling the initial consonant of the word it precedes. Now, let’s continue with some more words and 
expressions.
VOCABULARY BUILDING 2

TAKE A BREAK 2
Let’s pause here for a moment. You have just learned how to say m∫ ismuk? or m∫ ismuki? (What is 
your name?). Note the word m∫ (what) is used to ask questions and usually followed by a noun, such as 
ism (name). Note also that the -uk on ismuk is the equivalent of the English your but works as an ending 
on a word in Arabic. So, instead of possessive pronouns, Arabic uses possessive endings or sufﬁ xes that 
attach to the end of a noun. Possessive sufﬁ xes show the gender (masculine or feminine) and the number 
(singular, dual, or plural) of the nouns they attach to: -uk is singular masculine, so the question m∫ 
ismuk? can only be addressed to a man. When addressing a woman, say m∫ ismuki? The possessive sufﬁ x 
for my is -º, as in ismº (my name). But more on that later.
ONE MORE TIME
Okay, let’s put to use what you’ve learned so far. You’ll hear the English ﬁ rst, and then the Arabic, which 
you should repeat for practice.
Hello. How are you? 
ahlan. kayf  al- H∫l?
Fine, thank you.  
 bi- khayr, shukran.
What is your name? 
m∫ ismuk?
My name is Jason. I am from New York. 
ismº jason. ana min new york.
Nice to meet you. 
tasharrafn∫.
BRING IT ALL TOGETHER
Now let’s bring it all together in a conversation and add a little bit more vocabulary and structure.
Hello! 
ahlan!
Good morning! 
Sab∫H  al- khayr!

How are you? 
kayf  al- H∫l?
Fine, thank you. 
 bi- khayr, shukran.
What is your name? 
m∫ ismuk?
My name is Jason. 
ismi jason.
Are you from America? 
anta min amrºka?
Yes, I am from New York.  
na‘am, ana min new york.
Are you a tourist? 
anta s∫’iH?
No, I am a student. 
kalla, ana T∫lib.
Nice to meet you, Jason. 
tasharrafn∫, ya jason.
Okay, you already knew a lot of the vocabulary used in this conversation, but there were a few new words 
and expressions, too. You probably noticed the question anta min amrºka? (Are you from America?) and 
the question anta s∫’iH? (Are you a tourist?), as well as the answer kalla, ana T∫lib (No, I am a student). 
You already know the word ana, meaning I, and now you have also learned the word anta, meaning you. 
Note that the pronoun anta can only be used to refer to a man; if you are addressing a woman, use anti. 
You’ll learn the rest of the personal pronouns later.
And did you notice the little word ya before jason in tasharrafn∫, ya jason? ya is a vocative particle often 
used in Arabic in front of the name of the person you are addressing directly; it’s a bit similar to the way 
hey can be used in English, as in Hey, Jason! You’ll be hearing it a lot.
WORK OUT
Now let’s practice some of what you’ve learned. First, you’ll hear a phrase in Arabic, and you should 
translate it into English. You’ll hear the correct answer after a pause.
ahlan. 
Hello.
kayf  al- H∫l?  
How are you?
m∫ ismuk? 
What is your name?
tasharrafn∫. 
Nice to meet you.
ma‘a s- sal∫ma. 
 Good- bye.
Great. Now do the opposite, translating the phrase from English into Arabic. After a pause, you’ll hear the 
right answer, which you should repeat for practice.

Good morning. 
Sab∫H  al- khayr.
Excuse me. 
‘afwan.
I would like . . .  
uridu . . .
Thank you. 
shukran.
With pleasure. 
 bikull- i surur.
Now translate the following words and phrases into Arabic, then put together short sentences by using the 
suggested  pronouns— ana (I), anta (you, male), or anti (you, female). For example, if you hear student, 
ana, you’d respond by saying ana T∫lib. Repeat the correct answers for practice.
student, ana 
ana T∫lib.
tourist, anta 
anta s∫’iH.
from America, anti 
anti min amrºka.
from New York, ana 
ana min new york.
PARTING WORDS
mabræk! Congratulations! You’ve ﬁ nished your ﬁ rst lesson of Arabic. Good job! Did you know that there 
are around twenty different dialects of Arabic spoken throughout the Arab world? The vocabulary you 
are learning here is the modern version of literary classical Arabic, often referred to as Modern Standard 
Arabic, which is understood throughout the Arab world. However, there are many local dialects of 
Arabic, so be ready for variations! Today you’ve learned the basic vocabulary you need to greet people 
and introduce yourself. You may, of course, want to learn a few other everyday phrases, like Hasanan (all 
right), shukran jazºlan (many thanks), kafa’ (enough), and  ila- liqa’ (so long). See you in Lesson 2!

Lesson 2: People and the family
ahlan! Hello! In this lesson, you’ll learn how to talk about people and your family. You’ll also learn some 
important points of Arabic grammar: masculine and feminine genders of nouns and the singular, dual, and 
plural forms of nouns. But let’s learn some new vocabulary ﬁ rst. As before, you’ll hear the English ﬁ rst, 
followed by the Arabic. Repeat each new word or phrase every time you hear it. haya’a nabda’a! Let’s 
begin!

TAKE A BREAK 1
Have you noticed the strong sounding m in umm (mother) and b in abb (father)? These are examples of 
“doubled” consonants that are pronounced with more emphasis and force than their single counterparts. 
And did you notice that the word bint means both girl and daughter in Arabic? Great!
Okay, now let’s talk about the gender of nouns. Arabic nouns can be classiﬁ ed as either masculine or 
feminine, usually depending on their endings. For example, feminine nouns often end in -a, such as the 
feminine noun ‘∫’ila (family). This system is not perfect, however, and other words of feminine gender 
do not end in -a, like yadd (hand). On the other hand, feminine nouns referring to people are usually 
created by adding -a to the end of the masculine form. One example is the word zawja (wife), which is 
formed by adding -a to the masculine form, zawj (husband). zawja becomes zawjat, with a -t at the end, 
if a possessive ending is added to the noun. For example, when we attach the possessive ending -i (my) to 
zawja, we get zawjati (my wife).
When an adjective modiﬁ es a noun, it must match the noun in  gender— for example, ‘∫’ilati kabºra (my 
family is big), where kabºra is the feminine version of the masculine form of the adjective kabºr (big).
When you want to talk about more than one of something in Arabic, you use either the plural form or the 
dual form of the noun. The dual is used to refer to two of something; the plural is used for three or more. 
Let’s look at how this works on examples, while learning some additional vocabulary.

‘∫’ilat∫n kabºrat∫n
big families (f. pl.) 
‘∫’il∫t kabºra
TAKE A BREAK 2
So let’s break down what you’ve just learned. You probably noticed that the dual is formed by adding -∫n 
to the singular form of a noun, as in walad∫n (two boys), bint∫n (two girls), and ‘∫’ilat∫n (two families). 
As for the plural, Arabic has both the regular and the irregular plural. The regular plural is formed by 
adding -æn to masculine  nouns— mudarrisæn ([male] teachers)—and -∫t to feminine  nouns— mudarris∫t 
([female] teachers). Unfortunately, most Arabic nouns have irregular plurals, and the vowels of the root 
are either changed or taken out and the word thereby transformed in unpredictable ways. The best way 
to learn these irregular plural forms is simply to memorize them. Today you have learned irregular plurals 
awl∫d (boys), ban∫t (girls), and ‘∫’il∫t (families).
As for the adjectives, we mentioned earlier that they must match the noun in number and gender. For 
example, ‘∫’ila kabºra (big family) is feminine singular; ‘∫’ilat∫n kabºrat∫n (two big families) is feminine 
dual; and ‘∫’il∫t kabºra (big families) is feminine plural. Did you notice that the same singular form, 
kabºra, was used with both the singular— ‘∫’ila— and the plural noun—‘∫’il∫t? That’s because the singular 

8
form of the adjective is used with plural nouns that denote inanimate objects. When an adjective is used 
with a noun that refers to people, like mudarris∫t ([female] teachers), it has to be in the plural form, e.g., 
mudarris∫t jayyidat (good teachers).
ONE MORE TIME
Now, let’s use some of what you’ve learned in a short comprehension exercise. You’ll notice the deﬁ nite 
article, al, in front of some of the words. Listen to the English ﬁ rst, then to the Arabic, which you should 
repeat for practice. Use the word wa to say and.
father of two boys 
abb  al- walad∫n
mother of two girls 
umm  al- bint∫n
The father and brother are teachers. 
 al- abb wa  al- akh mudarris∫n.
The mother and sister are good teachers. 
 al- umm wa  al- ukht mudarrisat∫n jayyidatan.
My sister’s and my brother’s families are big. 
‘∫’il∫t ukhti wa akhi kabºra.
BRING IT ALL TOGETHER
Now let’s bring it all together and add a little bit more vocabulary and structure. Listen to Ahmed talking 
about himself. Repeat the Arabic in the pauses provided.
My name is Ahmed. 
ismi aHmed.
I am a doctor. 
ana duktΩr.
My family is big. 
‘∫’ilati kabºra.
This is my wife. 
h∫dhihi zawjati.
My wife is a teacher. 
zawjati mudarrisa.
We have a girl and two boys. 
ladaina bint wa waladan.
This is my mother. 
h∫dhihi ummi.
My mother is a teacher too.  
ummi aiDan mudarrisa.
My wife and my mother are both teachers. 
zawjati wa ummi mudarissat∫n.
My father is an engineer. 
abi muhandis.
This is my sister, Mariam, my brother Mustafa,  
h∫dhihi ukhti, mariam, akhi mustafa, wa akhi  
and my little brother, Farouk.  
aS- Saghir farouk.
Mariam, Mustafa, and Faruk are students. 
mariam, mustafa, wa faruk Tull∫b.

9
You probably understood most of the words and phrases in this segment, but there were also some new 
ones. You probably guessed that duktΩr means doctor and that muhandis means engineer. Can you guess 
what the feminine form of muhandis is? Yes, that’s  right— muhandisa. And have you spotted ladaina, 
the useful word you can use to say we have? You must have guessed that hadhihi means this in h∫dhihi 
zawjati (this is my wife). You’ll learn more demonstratives in the coming lessons. Finally,  aS- Saghir means 
little or small, aiDan means also, and Tull∫b (students) is the irregular plural of T∫lib (student). And note 
an interesting thing about Arabic grammar: There is no equivalent of the verb to be and its forms, such 
as am or is, in Arabic sentences like ana duktΩr (I’m a doctor), abi muhandis (My father is an engineer), 
or ‘∫’ilati kabºra (My family is big). The subject pronoun or noun is combined directly with the predicate 
noun or adjective that is used to describe it.
WORK OUT
Now let’s practice some of what you’ve learned. You’ll hear a word in Arabic. You should translate it into 
English. You’ll hear the correct answer after a pause.
rajul 
man
imra’a 
woman
‘∫’ila

Great! Now do the opposite; translate the phrase from English into Arabic. After a pause, you’ll hear the 
right answer, which you should repeat for practice.

PARTING WORDS
shukran! Thank you! You’ve been very attentive and learned a lot of new vocabulary and grammar. Now 
you can talk about people and your family in Arabic. Of course, there will be times when you may need to 
mention other members of your family, like your grandmother ( jedda), grandfather ( jedd), granddaughter 
(haﬁ da), or grandson (haﬁ d). In Arabic, aunts and uncles on the mother’s side and those on the father’s 
side are clearly distinguished. So, the maternal uncle is kh∫l, and the paternal uncle is ‘amm. The maternal 
aunt is kh∫la and the paternal aunt is ‘amma. That’s it for today! yauman s’aºdan! Have a wonderful 
day!

Lesson 3: Numbers
kayf  al- H∫l? How are you? Are you ready for more Arabic words? In this lesson, you’ll learn how to count 
in Arabic. So, let’s get started right away. By now you know that you’ll hear the English ﬁ rst, and then 
you’ll hear the Arabic. Repeat each new word or phrase every time you hear it. haya’a nabda’a. Let’s

TAKE A BREAK 1
Okay, let’s stop for a minute. So you’ve learned how to say zero (Sifr) and how to count from w∫hid (one) 
to ‘ashara (ten). Notice that, when counting, the numbers Sifr, w∫hid and ithn∫n, zero, one and two, are 
used in their masculine forms, and others are used in their feminine forms. When modifying a noun, most 
numbers, like adjectives, have to agree with it in gender. Curiously, however, the numbers three (thal∫tha) 
through ten (‘ashara) must disagree in gender with the noun that follows them. For example, in thal∫th 
T∫lib∫t (three students), thal∫th, which is masculine, modiﬁ es T∫lib∫t, which is feminine. So far, so good. 
Now, let’s keep counting with from eleven to nineteen.

TAKE A BREAK 2
Let’s take a break here. You’ve just learned to count to tis‘at ‘ashara (nineteen). The number agreement 
between teens and nouns that follow them is also tricky: The noun that follows a number in the teens is 
usually in the singular, not the plural form. For example, in khamsat ‘ashara s∫’ih (ﬁ fteen male tourists), 
the noun s∫’ih (male tourist) is singular masculine and in khamsat ‘ashara s∫’iha (ﬁ fteen female tourists), 
the noun s∫’iha (female tourist) is singular feminine.

Okay, let’s put these numbers together with some of the nouns you learned earlier and see how the

Luckily, the tens do not have separate forms for masculine and feminine; the same form is used with 
either gender. The ones are joined with the tens by the conjunction wa (and). Also, unlike in English, the 
ones precede the tens in all  two- digit numbers above twenty. For example, w∫hid wa thalathæn  (thirty-
 one) is literally one and thirty, and sitta wa tham∫næn  (eighty- six) is literally six and eighty.

Now let’s practice some of what you’ve learned. First, you’ll hear a number in Arabic, and you should 
translate it into English. You’ll hear the correct answer after a pause.

that Arabic numbers are written differently from English numbers? The written form of Arabic numerals is 
actually of Indian origin. And the numerals used in English are of Arabic origin! ‘alam Saghºr! It’s a small

Lesson 4: Around the house
marHaba! Welcome! Hopefully, you have been practicing your Arabic vocabulary and have even managed 
to interact a bit with people in Arabic. In this lesson, you’ll learn more about Arabic verbs and nouns, 
constructing simple sentences and using descriptive words to talk about your home. As you already know, 
you’ll hear the English ﬁ rst, and then you’ll hear the Arabic. Repeat each new word or phrase every time 
you hear it. Ready?

TAKE A BREAK 1
Okay, let’s stop here. You learned how to say a house (bayt), a room (ghurfa), a bedroom (ghurfat  an-
 na’um), a living room (ghurfat  aj- julus), a dining room (ghurfat  aT- Ta‘∫m), a kitchen (maTbakh), a 
bathroom (Hamm∫m), and a garden (Hadºqa). Did you notice the sound gh in the word ghurfa? This 
sound is pronounced from deep in the throat. You also learned the verb yaskun (to live). Notice that both 
verbs and nouns can have different endings, such as -u on yaskunu and -tun on Hadºqatun, depending 
on their position in the sentence. Now let’s talk about sentence construction. There are two types of 
sentences in Arabic: verbal sentences, which begin with a  verb— for example, yaskunu aHmed  ﬁ - l bayt 
(Ahmed lives in the house)—and nominal sentences, which begin with a noun, such as Hadºqatun jamºla 
(a garden is pretty). Great! Now let’s continue with more words and phrases.

TAKE A BREAK 2
You’ve just learned a few new verbs, all used in the  so- called imperfect tense. The imperfect tense in 
Arabic is used to talk about actions taking place in the present. Have you noticed how the verbs change 
their form to agree with the subject? Ahmed sleeps is yanamu aHmed, where the verb carries a masculine 
preﬁ x, ya- , and Mona sleeps is tanamu mona, with the verb carrying a feminine preﬁ x, ta- . Remember the 
verbs in the rest of the phrases you’ve just heard: y’akulu aHmed (Ahmed eats), t’akulu mona (Mona 
eats), yajlisu aHmed (Ahmed sits), tajlisu mona (Mona sits). The verbs change their form to match the 
gender of the subject but also according to the person talked about: verbs used with ana (I) carry the 
preﬁ x a- , as in ana ajlis (I sit), and verbs used with anta/anti (you) carry the preﬁ x ta- , as in anta tajlis 
(you are sitting) for the masculine and anti tajlisi (you are sitting) for the feminine. Notice that in the 
latter example, the verb also carries the feminine ending, -i. The ending -an marks the dual  they— Mona 
and Ahmed are sitting is mona wa aHmed  yajlisan— and -un is used for the plural  they— mona, aHmed, 
wa mustafa yajlisun (Mona, Ahmed, and Mustafa are sitting).
ONE MORE TIME
Let’s practice verbs some more. You’ll hear the English ﬁ rst, and then the Arabic, which you should repeat 
for practice. Notice that the preﬁ x ta-  marks the verbs used with you, either singular or plural, and ya-  
marks those used with he and the masculine they. Remember that the plural ending -un is used with the 
plural you and they, while the ending -an marks the verbs used with the dual they.
I sleep in the bedroom. 
ana anamu ﬁ  ghurfat  an- na’um.
You sleep in the bedroom. (to a man) 
anta tanamu ﬁ  ghurfat  an- na’um.
You sleep in the bedroom. (to a woman)

BRING IT ALL TOGETHER
Now let’s bring it all together in a dialogue and add a little bit more vocabulary.
I live in a house with my wife, Mona. 
askunu  ﬁ - l bayti ma‘a zawjati, mona.
Our house is new. 
baytuna jadºd.
It has ﬁ ve rooms. 
ﬁ hi khams ghuraf.
The bedroom has a large window. 
ghurfat  an- na’um ﬁ ha shurfa kabºra.
The window looks out onto a garden. 
 ash- shurfa taTullu  ala- l Hadºqa.
Our furniture is new. 
athathæna jadºd.
The dining table is new. 
ma’idat  aT- Ta‘∫m jadºda.
The kitchen utensils are new, too. 
adawat  al- maTbakh aiDan jadºda.
But the living room furniture is old. 
lakin athath ghurfat  aj- julus qadºm.
Our children love the new house. 
awladæna yahibbun  al- bayt  aj- jadºd.
It’s big, sunny, and near their school. 
innahu kabºr, mushmis, wa qarºb min 
 
madrasatuhum.
Okay, you already knew a lot of the vocabulary in this conversation, but let’s go over the new words that 
you’ve just heard. You probably already knew that jadºd (new) in the feminine form is jadºda. And you 
probably guessed that shurfa means window, that athath means furniture, that adawat  al- maTbakh are 
kitchen utensils, and that madrasa is school. And, of course, qadºm means old, and qarºb means near.
WORK OUT
And now let’s practice some of what you’ve learned. First, you’ll hear a word in Arabic, and you should 
translate it into English. You’ll hear the correct answer after a pause.
bayt 
a house
ghurfa  
a room
yanamu 
he sleeps
yajlisu 
he sits
Great! Now do the opposite, translating the phrase from English into Arabic. After a pause, you’ll hear the 
right answer, which you should repeat for practice.

18
bed 
sarºr
table 
ma’ida
chair 
maqa’ad
window 
shurfa
Now translate the following phrases into Arabic, and add some of the adjectives that you learned today to 
make short sentences. For example, if you hear a dining room, big, you might respond by saying ghurfat 
 aT- Ta‘∫m kabira (The dining room is big). Repeat the correct answers for practice.
a dining room, big 
ghurfat  aT- Ta‘∫m kabºra.
a living room, sunny 
ghurfat  aj- julus mushmisa.
a study, beautiful 
ghurfat  al- maktab jamºla.
a kitchen, new 
 al- maTbakh jadºd.
PARTING WORDS
rai’a! Wonderful! Now you know enough Arabic words to describe the rooms in your house. You may of 
course want to talk about the other parts of your house, like the entrance, madhhal; the ﬂ oor you live on, 
 aT- Tabiq; a guest room, ghurfat  aD- Duyæf; or the elevator,  al- miSa’ad. Did you know that in many parts 
of the Arab world, the local dialects employ many English and French words? So, for example, the word 
villa in Arabic is . . . villa!  ilal- iq∫! So long!

descriptive words, like those used for colors. You will also learn to use different personal and 
demonstrative pronouns. haya’a nabda’a Halan! Let’s begin right away! You’ll hear the English ﬁ rst, and 
then you’ll hear the Arabic. Repeat each new word or phrase every time you hear it. Ready?

TAKE A BREAK 1
Okay, let’s stop for a moment. So now you know all the personal pronouns in Arabic. Let’s try to form 
sentences using some of these pronouns with adjectives. Remember that the verb to be does not exist 
in Arabic, so, in a sentence like you are tall, the adjective follows the pronoun directly and agrees with 
it in gender and number. For example: I am tall is ana Tawºl; you are tall is anta Tawºl, when talking to 
a man, and anti Tawºla, when talking to a woman; he is happy is huwa sa‘ºd; and she is happy is hiya 
sa‘ºda. The opposite of happy is unhappy, or in Arabic, laysa sa‘ºd, or simply t’∫is (sad). We will learn 
more about negating words and sentences in the coming lessons. And now let’s try the plurals: they 
are happy is hum su’ada’a, for men or mixed groups, and hunna sa‘ºdat, for women; we are happy is 
naHnu su’ada’a; and you are tall is antum Tuw∫l, if talking about more than two men, and antunna 
Tawºlat, if talking about more than two women. Okay, and now let’s learn some more new nouns and 
adjectives.

TAKE A BREAK 2
So now you’ve learned that white is abyaD, black is aswad, green is akhDar, blue is azraq, red is aHmar, 
and brown is bunnº. And you have also learned some new words for objects, like qalam (pen), waraqa 
(paper), kit∫b (book), fustan (dress), qamºs (shirt), and Hidha’a (shoes). Color words match the nouns 
they modify in gender and number, just like other adjectives.
Now let’s try to put this new vocabulary to use by combining it with Arabic demonstrative adjectives, such 
as h∫dha (this). Just like other adjectives, the demonstratives change according to gender and number of 
the noun they modify, so the feminine h∫dhihi (this), instead of the masculine h∫dha, has to be used 
next to a feminine noun. In the plural, h∫ula’i is the only demonstrative used when referring to people. 
When referring to inanimate objects, the singular feminine form h∫dhihi is used. Let’s give this a try.
ONE MORE TIME
You will notice how the color adjectives change their form depending on the gender of the noun they 
modify. Try to memorize these forms as you hear them. You’ll hear the English ﬁ rst, and then the Arabic, 
which you should repeat for practice.
This is a blue pen. 
h∫dha qalam azraq.
This is white paper.  
h∫dhihi waraqa bayd∫’.
This is a red dress. 
h∫dha fustan aHmar.
This is a black shirt.  
h∫dha qamºs aswad.
This is (a pair) of brown shoes.  
h∫dha Hidha’a bunnº.
These men are tall. 
h∫’ula’i  ar- rijal Tuw∫l.

21
These women are beautiful. 
h∫’ula’i  as- sayid∫t jamºl∫t.
This book is big. 
h∫dha  al- kit∫b kabºr.
BRING IT ALL TOGETHER
Now let’s bring it all together and add a little bit more vocabulary and structure. When you hear nouns 
you are familiar with in unexpected forms, remember that nouns get different endings depending on their 
placement and function in sentences.
I am very happy! 
ana sa‘ºdun jiddan!
My family is here in my house. 
‘∫’ilati huna ﬁ  bayti.
This is my brother’s son Samir. 
h∫dha ibn akhi s∫mir.
Samir is a child. 
s∫mir Tiﬂ .
Samir wants to draw. 
s∫mir yuridu an yarsum.
His father gives him a pen and a paper. 
abuhu ya’aTihi qalamun wa waraqa.
Samir draws a girl. 
s∫mir yarsimu bintan.
The girl is wearing a red dress. 
 al- bint tartadi fustan aHmar.
The girl’s hair is brown. 
sha’ar  al- bint bunnº.
It’s his little sister Samia. 
h∫dhihi ukhtuh  aS- Saghºra samia.
Okay, let’s go over some of the new words that you just heard. jiddan means very, and huna means here. 
You also learned a few new verbs, like yuridu (wants), yarsum (draws), ya’aTi (gives), and tartadi (wears). 
And you have also learned the words Tiﬂ  for child and Saghºra for small. Can you guess what the feminine 
form of Tiﬂ  is? That’s right; it’s Tiﬂ a. And can you guess the masculine form of the adjective Saghºra? 
You’re right again; it’s Saghºr. Now, let’s move on.
WORK OUT
It’s time to practice some of what you’ve learned. First, you’ll hear a phrase in Arabic, and you should 
translate it into English. You’ll hear the correct answer after a pause.
rajul Tawºl 
a tall man
Tiﬂ  sa‘ºd

Now translate the following personal pronouns and nouns into Arabic, and then make sentences using 
some of the descriptive and color adjectives you’ve just learned. For example, if you hear you, tall, you 
should say anta Taweel or anti Taweela. Repeat the correct answers for practice.

TAKE A BREAK 1
Okay, let’s take a minute to go over what you’ve just heard. You learned some important words, such as 
maktab  al- barºd (post ofﬁ ce), Saydali’ya (pharmacy), mustashfa (hospital), baq∫la (supermarket), j∫mi‘a 
(university), maT∫r (airport), funduq (hotel), say∫rat  al- ujra (taxi), ‘anw∫n (address), sh∫r’a (street), 
mayd∫n (square), and taq∫Tu’a (intersection). Now let’s talk a bit about some new important points of 
Arabic grammar.
There are two interrogative particles in Arabic used to form questions. One is the particle m∫ (what), 
which you came across earlier, and the other is the particle hal, used to form  yes- no questions. For 

24
example, you may ask m∫ h∫dha? (What is this?) and hear h∫dha maktab  al- barºd (This is the post ofﬁ ce) 
in response. Or you may ask a  yes- no question such as hal h∫dhihi Saydali’ya? (Is this a pharmacy?), 
and hear kalla, h∫dhihi baq∫la (No, this is a  super market) in response. Okay, now let’s learn a bit more 
vocabulary and some useful prepositions that will make asking for directions and getting around much 
easier. Ready?

TAKE A BREAK 2
Let’s go over these new words one more time. You’ve heard several prepositions and words that will help 
you describe the placement of things around you: huna (here), hunak (there), qarºb (near), ba‘ºd (far), 
yamºn (right), yasar (left), qabl (before), ba‘d (after), am∫m (in front of ), khalf (behind), bij∫nib (next 
to), and  ilal- amam (straight ahead). To ask for directions, you will also need to know the question word 
aina? (where?). A lot of Arabic location expressions are held together by various prepositions; for example, 
the preposition min (from) is used together with the adjective qarºb (near) to say qarºb min (near to). 
Another word for from is ‘ann used in conjunction with the adjective ba‘ºd (far) in the phrase ba‘ºd ‘ann 
(far from). You might also have spotted the preposition ila (to or towards), which you heard used in the 
word  ilal- am∫m, meaning towards the front or straight ahead.

25
ONE MORE TIME
Okay, now let’s put everything you’ve learned so far together into several questions and answers. Ready? 
As always, you’ll hear the English ﬁ rst, and then the Arabic, which you should repeat for practice.
Where is this street? 
aina h∫dha  ash- sh∫r’a?
The supermarket is near the hotel. 
 al- baq∫la qariba min  al- funduq.
The pharmacy is behind the post ofﬁ ce. 
 as- Saydali’ya khalf maktab  al- barºd.
Is the taxi here? 
hal say∫rat  al- ojra huna?
There is an intersection before the square. 
hunaka taq∫Tua qabl  al- mayd∫n.
Is this address far? 
hal h∫dha al- ‘anw∫n ba‘ºd?
The hospital is behind the university. 
 al- mustashfa khalf  aj- j∫mi‘a.
I am in front of the post ofﬁ ce. 
ana am∫m maktab  al- barºd.
BRING IT ALL TOGETHER
Now let’s bring it all together, and add a little bit more vocabulary and structure.
Excuse me, I am looking for this address. 
‘afwan, abHathu ‘ann h∫dha al- ‘anw∫n.
This hotel is on  Al- Nuzha Street. 
h∫dha  al- funduq ﬁ  sh∫r’a  al- nuzha.
Is  Al- Nuzha Street near here? 
hal sh∫r’a  al- nuzha qarºb min huna?
Yes,  Al- Nuzha street is behind  Al- Thawra Square. 
na’am, sh∫r’a  al- nuzha khalf mayd∫n  ath- thawra.
And where is this square? 
wa ayna h∫dha  al- mayd∫n?
This square is after the intersection and before  
h∫dha  al- mayd∫n ba‘d  at- taq∫Tua wa qabl  aj- j∫mi‘a
the American University.

No, it’s close to here,  
kalla, innahu qarºb min huna,
and it’s a nice walk. 
wa innaha nuzhatun jamºla.
Thank you for your help. 
shukran  li- mus∫’adatak.
Okay, I am sure you spotted a few new words and maybe even ﬁ gured out what they mean. You know the 
important words ‘afwan (excuse me) and shukran (thank you) from previous lessons. The verb abHathu 

26
means I am looking for. You can practice the various imperfect tense forms of this verb by referring back 
to the verbs taught in Lesson 4. And surely you noticed the preposition li (for) next to mus∫’adatak in 
 li- mus∫’adatak (for your help).
Notice that many names of streets, squares, and stores in Arab countries have an actual meaning. So, 
sh∫r’a  al- nuzha means a street where you can take a nice walk, or the Promenade Street. The other new 
words that you’ve just heard are SaHHa (health), used in the name of the pharmacy, Saydali’yat  aS-
 SaHHa or the Health Pharmacy, and  ath- thawra (revolution), used in the name of the square, mayd∫n 
 ath- thawra or the Revolution Square.
WORK OUT
Now let’s practice some of what you’ve learned. First, you’ll hear a word in Arabic, and you should 
translate it into English. You’ll hear the correct answer after a pause.

And now, put these words together into short sentences. For example, if you hear hospital, here, you 
should say  al- mustashfa huna (The hospital is here). Repeat the correct answers for practice.
hospital, here 
 al- mustashfa huna.

al- ‘anw∫n qarºb.

 al- taq∫Tu’a ba‘ºd.

PARTING WORDS
Remember that a lot of English and French words have been borrowed into colloquial dialects of Arabic, 
so in some Arab countries, you will ﬁ nd that a supermarket is referred to simply as a supermarket and a 
taxi is simply a taxi. You might also need to go to a bank (maSraf), which can also be referred to as bank. 
And in the evening, you may consider going to the cinema (movies). If you do, have a good time! waqtan

Okay, let’s stop for a moment. You’ve just learned how to say please (min faDlak), breakfast (iftar), 
lunch (ghad∫’a), dinner (‘asha’a), restaurant (maT‘am), café (maqh∫), tea (sha’i), coffee (qahwa), milk 
(Halºb), sugar (sukkar), water (m∫’), and menu (q∫’imat  aT- Ta‘∫m).
Of course, you will need to know some more verbs to be able to construct complete sentences. 
Remember from Lesson 4 that Arabic verbs use preﬁ xes and sufﬁ xes to reﬂ ect the gender and number 
of the person talking, talked to or  about— for example, aHmed yatanawal  al- iftar (Ahmed is eating 
breakfast), mona tashrab  ash- sha’i (Mona is drinking tea), and mustafa y’akul  ﬁ l- maT‘am (Mustafa is 
eating at the restaurant). You can practice the other forms of each of these three verbs on your own, using 
the verbs in Lesson 4 for reference. And now, are you ready for some more vocabulary? As usual, listen 
and repeat in the pauses provided.

TAKE A BREAK 2
You’ve just learned some important expressions, such as mumkin . . . ? (May I have . . . ?), 
s’atanawal . . . (I will have . . . ). and urid . . . (I would like . . . ), as well as such vocabulary as shah’i 
(delicious), laHm (meat), daj∫j (chicken), ruz (rice), khuDrawat (vegetables), shurba (soup), khubz 
(bread), salaTa (salad), Halwa (dessert), kæb (a glass), and ﬁ nj∫n (a cup). Do you remember the 
preposition ﬁ  (in) from previous lessons? You can use it here to say things like  al- m∫’  ﬁ l- kæb (The water 
is in the glass). And you already know that prepositions sometimes blend into the deﬁ nite article al, as 
in  ﬁ l- ﬁ nj∫n (in the cup) or  bil- maT‘am (at the restaurant). And by the way, just to refresh your memory 
about the Arabic gender, the feminine form of the adjective shah’º (delicious) is shah’ºya. So, for example, 
we say laHm shah’i (delicious meat), because the word for meat in Arabic, laHm, is of masculine gender, 
but for soup, shurba, which is of feminine gender, we say shurba shah’ºya (delicious soup).
ONE MORE TIME
Okay, let’s put everything you’ve learned so far together in short sentences. You’ll hear the English ﬁ rst, 
and then the Arabic, which you should repeat for practice.
This is a good restaurant for dinner.

Now let’s bring it all together in a dialogue and add a little bit more vocabulary and structure.
May I have the menu, please?

Of course. Here is the dinner menu.

No. I will only have a cup of coffee with milk  
kalla. s’atanawal ﬁ nj∫n qahwa  bil- Halºb faqaT ba‘d

al- ‘asha’a.
Okay, you already have enough knowledge of Arabic and have probably ﬁ gured out the meanings of all 
the new words that you just heard. Let’s go over them just in case: anSaHuki bi (I recommend), afDal 
(better),  ﬁ sh- shit∫’ (in the winter), Hasanan (all right), mashui (grilled), ikhtiyar (choice), idha samaht 
(if you please),  bil- ta’akºd (of course), and faqaT (only). And you probably noticed the new preposition 
ma‘a (with) in  ma‘ad- daj∫j (with the chicken).
WORK OUT
Now let’s practice some of what you’ve learned. First, you’ll hear a phrase in Arabic, and you should 
translate it into English. You’ll hear the correct answer after a pause.

PARTING WORDS
‘aDHim! Great! You’ve ﬁ nished the lesson and learned the basic vocabulary that you need to be able 
to enjoy some of the wonderful foods the Arab countries have to offer. Of course, you might also need 
to ask for a plate (Tabaq), a spoon (mil’aqa), a fork (shuka), or a knife (sakkºn). Did you know that 
during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, many Arabs observe a complete fast and do not eat or drink 
anything from sunrise to sunset? Also during Ramadan, you will hear that dinner— ‘ash’aa— is referred to 
as  breakfast— iftar— because it’s the ﬁ rst meal of the day after the fast is broken at sunset. The month of 
Ramadan is followed by a holiday called eid  al- ﬁ Tr, a three day celebration during which it is customary to 
visit your friends and relatives and enjoy many grand meals. wajba haniya! Have a nice meal!

Lesson 8: Everyday life
ahlan wa sahlan! Welcome! In this lesson, you’ll learn more vocabulary and structure that will help you 
communicate with others about everyday life and topics such as weather. You’ll also learn how to make 
requests and issue commands, and how to negate nouns, adjectives and verbs. As always, you’ll hear 
the English ﬁ rst, and then the Arabic. Repeat each new word or phrase every time you hear it. haya’a

TAKE A BREAK 1
Okay, let’s take a break here. You learned how to say  al- yaum (today), usbæ‘ (week), shahr (month), 
Sayf (summer), rabº‘ (spring), and kharºf (fall). You learned the Arabic word for winter in the previous 
lesson. Can you remember what it was? That’s right; it’s shit∫’. Today you also learned how to say jaww 
(weather), jarºda (newspaper), akhb∫r (news), matHaf (museum), and masraH (theater).
Now let’s talk a bit about the imperative form of Arabic verbs used to issue commands and make requests. 
Imperatives are formed by adding a vowel to the beginning of the verbs, in place of the preﬁ xes that you 
already know. There are three forms of the imperative: masculine, when addressing a man; feminine, 
when addressing a woman; and plural, when addressing more than one person. In addition to the vowel 
at the beginning, the feminine form also takes the ending -i and the plural form takes the ending -u. Let’s 
take the imperfect masculine form of the verb to go, yadhhab (he goes), as an example. The imperative 
masculine singular form of this verb is idhhab! (Go!) and the imperative feminine singular is idhhabi! 
(Go!). The plural form is idhahbu! (Go!). We’ll practice the imperatives in sentences later on in this 
lesson. Now, let’s continue with some more useful vocabulary.

TAKE A BREAK 2
Let’s pause here. You’ve learned a lot of useful adjectives, like daﬁ ’i (warm), H∫rr (hot), b∫rid (cold), laTif 
(pleasant), shadºd (strong), mu’atadil (moderate), and j∫f (dry). But what if you want to say not warm? An 
adjective in Arabic is negated by placing the particle laysa directly before it. With adjectives of feminine 
gender, laysat, with a -t at the end, is used instead. For example: laysa daﬁ ’i (not warm) and laysa H∫rr 
(not hot) for the masculine, and laysat daﬁ ’a (not warm) and laysat H∫rra (not hot) for the feminine. To 
negate verbs use ma for verbs in the imperfect tense and lan for verbs in the future  tense— for example: 
ma adhhab (I am not going), lan adhhab (I will not go). You’ll hear more examples of negative adjectives 
and verbs later on in the lesson.
ONE MORE TIME
Okay, let’s put together everything you’ve learned so far. As usual, you’ll hear the English ﬁ rst, and then 
the Arabic, which you should repeat for practice.

But today let’s go to a place of nature! 
wa lakin  al- yaum haya nadhab  ilal- Tabi‘a!
Great idea!  
ﬁ kra ha’ila!
Okay, let’s go over the new words in this dialogue: mon’aisha (refreshing), Hasab (according to),  an-
 nashra  al- jawwiya (weather forecast), da’eman (always), aHyanan (sometimes), mæmTir (rainy),  ala- l 
iTlaq (at all), uHebbu (I like or I love), and Tabi‘a (nature). Now let’s practice some of what you’ve 
learned. Isn’t this a ﬁ kra ha’ila, a great idea?
WORK OUT
First, you’ll hear a phrase in Arabic, and you should translate it into English. You’ll hear the correct answer 
after a pause.
al- jaww H∫rr. 
The weather is hot.
ash- shams daﬁ ’a.  
The sun is warm.
ar- riyaH laysat b∫rida. 
The wind is not cold.
idhhab  ilal- masraH.  
Go to the theater. (to a man)
idhhabi  ilal- matHaf.  
Go to the museum. (to a woman)

35
Great! Now do the opposite, translating the phrase from English into Arabic. After a pause, you’ll hear the 
right answer, which you should repeat for practice.
Go! (to a man) 
idhhab!
Go! (to a woman) 
idhhabi!
Go! (to a group of people) 
idhhabu!
The summer is not cold. 
 aS- Sayf laysa b∫rid.
The winter is not dry. 
 ash- shit∫’ laysa j∫f.
Now translate the following words into Arabic, and then negate them using the particle laysa. Repeat the 
correct answers for practice.

Harr, laysa H∫rr
pleasant 
laTif, laysa laTif
strong 
shadºd, laysa shadºd

PARTING WORDS
r∫’ca! Wonderful! You’ll be happy to know that the weather is quite pleasant in most Arab countries 
throughout the year, except for the summers, which can be quite hot, so make sure you go prepared. Did 
you know that many Arab countries, for religious and sometimes also civil purposes, follow a calendar 
different from the Gregorian calendar used in the United States? The Islamic Hijri calendar, or  al- taquºm 
 al- hijri, is calculated from the year AD 622, when the prophet Mohamed emigrated to Mecca. And while 
the names of the Gregorian calendar months in Arabic are very similar to their European  counterparts—
 for example, yanayir for January, ﬁ brayir for February, and mars for  March— the months of the Islamic 
calendar have very different names, like muHarram for the ﬁ rst month of the year, Safar for the second 
month, and rabº‘  al- awwal for the third month.  ilal- liq’a! Till next time!

addition to learning some  work- related vocabulary. Let’s get started right away! First you’ll hear the 
English, and then you’ll hear the Arabic. Repeat each new word or phrase every time you hear it.

TAKE A BREAK 1
Okay, let’s stop here and sum up what you’ve just heard. You learned how to say days of the week in 
Arabic:  al- ithnayn (Monday),  ath- thul∫th∫’ (Tuesday),  al- arbi‘∫’ (Wednesday),  al- khamºs (Thursday), 
 al- jum‘a (Friday),  as- sabt (Saturday), and  al- aHad (Sunday). The day of the week is always preceded by 
the word yaum (day); for example, Monday is referred to as yaum  al- ithnayn. You also learned how to 
say ghadan (tomorrow),  al- b∫riHa (yesterday),  aDH- DHuhr (noon), ba‘d  aDH- DHuhr (afternoon), and 
 al- layl (night). And I’m sure you remember the words Sab∫H (morning) and mas∫’ (evening) from Lesson 
1 and the word usbæ‘ (week) from Lesson 8. Now, let’s add a couple of more useful words. m∫Di means 
last, and q∫dim means next. So, if you’d like to refer to something that happened last Monday, you would 

37
say  al- ithnayn  al- m∫Di, and to refer to something that will happen next Monday, you would say  al-
 ithnayn  al- q∫dim. Okay, let’s listen now to some more vocabulary.

TAKE A BREAK 2
Let’s pause there for a moment. Now you know how to ask the time by using kam  al- waqt? (What time 
is it?) and answer the question by saying  as- s∫‘a . . . (It’s . . . o’clock, literally, The time is . . . ). You know 
how to form questions using mata (when), and you learned how to say s∫‘a (hour), daqºqa (minute), 
sana (year), niSf (half ), rub‘a (quarter), qarºban (soon), abadan (never), and  kulla- yaum (every day 
or daily). And do you remember the word aHyanan? Yes, you learned it in Lesson 8, and it means 
sometimes.
ONE MORE TIME
Okay, let’s put together everything you’ve learned so far with some prepositions and numbers and learn 
how to answer the question kam  al- waqt? (What time is it?) in several different ways. You’ll hear the 
English ﬁ rst, and then the Arabic, which you should repeat for practice.
What time is it?  
kam  al- waqt?
It’s exactly ten o’clock. 
 as- s∫‘a al- ‘ashara tamaman.
It’s ten past two. 
 as- s∫‘a  ath- thaniya wa ‘ashar daq∫’iq.

38
It’s ten to two. 
 as- s∫‘a  ath- thaniya illa ‘ashar daq∫’iq.
It’s half past three. 
 as- s∫‘a  ath- thaletha  wa n- niSf.
It’s a quarter past four. 
 as- s∫‘a  ar- rabi‘a  wa r- rub‘.
It’s a quarter to four. 
 as- s∫‘a  ar- r∫bi‘a illa rub‘.
It’s twelve o’clock noon. 
 as- s∫‘a  ath- th∫niyat ‘ashar Dhuhran.
It’s between two and four o’clock. 
 as- s∫‘a bayna  ath- th∫niya  war- r∫bi‘a.
It’s approximately four o’clock in the morning. 
 as- s∫‘a Hawali  ar- r∫bi‘a SabaHan.
It’s eight in the evening. 
 as- s∫‘a  ath- th∫mina mas∫’an.
It’s midnight. 
 al- waqt muntaSaf  al- layl.
Have you guessed that tamaman means exactly and that daq∫’iq (minutes) is the plural of daqºqa, 
midnight is muntaSaf  al- layla, bayna means between, Hawali means approximately, SabaHan means in 
the morning, and mas∫’an means in the evening? And notice that the expression  al- waqt muntaSaf  al- layl 
(it’s midnight) is an exception, with  al- waqt being used instead of  as- s∫‘a to indicate time.
BRING IT ALL TOGETHER
Now let’s bring it all together, and add a little bit more vocabulary and structure.
Welcome to our company!  
marHaban bik ﬁ  sharºkatuna!
Thank you! Am I late?  
shukran! hal ta’akhart?
No problem. Let me take you to your desk. 
la ba’as. d’aini uraﬁ quka ila maktabuk.
Everybody looks so busy! 
yabdu ann  al- j∫mi‘a mashghælæn jiddan!
It’s a big ofﬁ ce! This is your computer and you  
annahu maktab kabºr! haDHa huwa Hasæbak wa

 b- imkanak an tust’amal haDHa  al- hatif.
Thank you! I look forward to meeting my

colleagues!
I will introduce you to everyone at the meeting  
 sa- uqadimuka  lil- j∫mi‘a  al- yaum ba‘d  aDH- DHuhr
this afternoon. 
 ﬁ l- ijtim∫‘.
Okay, let’s sum up the new words you just heard. sharºkatuna as you must have guessed means our 
company. The word for company is sharºka, which can also mean partnership. Note the expressions hal 
ta’akhart? (Am I late?), la ba’as (No problem), and d’aini uraﬁ quka . . . (Let me take you to . . . ). In 
case you forget the Arabic words Hasæb (computer) and h∫tif (telephone), you can refer to them simply 
as kumbutir and tilifæn. yabdu means seems and mashghælæn is the plural form of busy. You must 

39
remember maktab from previous lessons as desk or study; here it also means  ofﬁ ce— makes sense! 
atTal’a ila means to look forward to, muqablat means meeting, zumala’i means my colleagues. And ﬁ nally, 
 sa- uqadimuka means I will introduce you and ijtim∫‘ means meeting.
WORK OUT
And now let’s practice some of what you’ve just learned. First, you’ll hear the days of the week in Arabic, 
and you should translate them into English. You’ll hear the correct answer after a pause.

Now translate the following phrases into Arabic. Later, you can practice different variations of time 
expressions on your own.
What time is it? 
kam  al- waqt?
It’s ten o’clock. 
 as- s∫‘a al- ‘ashara.

PARTING WORDS
mabræk! Congratulations! Now you will always know what time it is in Arabic, and if you  don’t, you’ll be 
able to ask! Of course, you might also need to ask other questions using the question word kam (how 
much), such as kam  as- sa‘ar? (What’s the price?), kam  al- wazn? (What’s the weight?), or kam darajat 
 al- Har∫ra? (What is the temperature?). By the way, remember that the metric system is used in most Arab 
countries, so you also need to know such words as kilo (kilogram), gram (gram), santimitr (centimeter), 
and mitr (meter), as well as the degrees in Celsius rather than Fahrenheit.

fun. Let’s go to the beach! And while we’re there, we will learn a lot of fun vocabulary that you can use 
to talk about socialiazing and entertainment. You’ll also learn some irregular plurals and get an idea of the 
comparative and superlative forms of adjectives in Arabic. Ready? You’ll hear the English ﬁ rst, and then 
you’ll hear the Arabic. Repeat each new word or phrase every time you hear it. haya nabd’a! Let’s begin!

TAKE A BREAK 1
Okay, let’s stop here for a moment. You already know the word nuzha (walk) from previous lessons, 
and now you also learned how to say uHeb (I love or I like), baHr (sea), b∫khira (boat), sh∫Ti’ (shore or 
beach), raml (sand), sib∫Ha (swimming), raqD (running), jib∫l (mountains), buHayra (lake), nahr (river), 
gh∫ba (forest), and SaHr∫‘a (desert). Imagine all the fun things you can say using these words! And if you 
are ready for more, in the evening, you can go dancing (r’∫qS).
Some of the nouns that you just heard have irregular plural forms. Let’s take a look at some examples; 
remember you’ll need to memorize these plurals as they do not follow the regular patterns we discussed 
earlier. First you’ll hear the singular, and then the plural: baHr (sea), biH∫r (seas); b∫khira (boat), 
baw∫khir (boats); sh∫Ti’ (shore), shaw∫Ti’i (shores); raml (sand), rim∫l (sands); nahr (river), anh∫r 
(rivers). And to refresh your memory about the regular plurals you learned in Lesson 2, let’s look at these 
examples: buHayra (lake), buHayr∫t (lakes); gh∫ba (forest), ghab∫t (forests). And what would be the 
singular form of the regular plural jib∫l (mountains)? That’s right; it’s jabal (mountain). Okay, let’s learn 
some more fun vocabulary.

TAKE A BREAK 2
Let’s take a minute to talk about how the comparative and superlative forms of adjectives are formed. 
These two forms are used to express degrees of a certain property when comparing two or more items. 
The Arabic comparative is formed by adding the preﬁ x a- to the beginning of an  adjective— for example, 
afDal  (better), aswa’a (worse), ashTar (more skillful). The comparative form can be used as an adverb, 
as in uhibbu h∫Dha afDal (I like this better), or as an adjective, followed by the preposition min (from), 
as in  ar- riy∫Da afDal min  an- nuzha (Sports are better than walking). The Arabic superlative form is 
constructed by adding the deﬁ nite article al to the comparative form, for example:  al- afDal (the best),  al-
 aswa’a (the worst),  al- ashTar (the most skillful).
ONE MORE TIME
Okay, let’s put everything you’ve learned so far together into complete sentences. You’ll hear the English 
ﬁ rst, and then the Arabic, which you should repeat for practice.
I love the sea. 
uHibbu  al- baHr.
I love swimming in the sea. 
uHibbu  as- sib∫Ha  ﬁ l- baHr.
I also love swimming in the lake. 
uHibbu ayDan  as- sib∫Ha  ﬁ l- buHayra.
But swimming in the river is better. 
wa lakin  as- sib∫Ha  ﬁ l- nahr afDal.
I also love the desert and the forest. 
uHibbu ayDan  as- SaHr∫‘a  wal- ghaba.
But the sea is the best! 
wa lakin  al- baHr huwa  al- afDal!
BRING IT ALL TOGETHER
Now let’s bring it all together and add a little bit more vocabulary and structure.
I am spending the day at the beach with my  
aqDi  al- yaum ala sh∫T’i  al- baHr ma‘a aSdiq∫’.

We love swimming in the sea.

But my team is better. 
lakin farºqº afDal.

43
We won!  
laqad fuzna!
What a great day! 
annahu yaumun aDHim!
And now let’s go over some of the new vocabulary you’ve just heard. aqDi means to spend time doing 
something. Refer to Lesson 4 if you’d like to ﬁ gure out the various imperfect tense forms of this verb. 
sanala’ab is the future tense of the verb yala’ab (to play), meaning we’ll play; fuzna is the past tense of 
the verb yafuz (to win), meaning we won. And aSdiq∫’ is the irregular plural of the masculine word Sadºq 
(friend). Can you guess what the feminine form of the word is? Yes, it’s Sadºqa. Okay, now let’s do some 
exercises for practice.
WORK OUT
First, you’ll hear a word in Arabic, and you should translate it into English. You’ll hear the correct answer 
after a pause.

PARTING WORDS
There are a lot of religious feasts and holidays in Arab countries, where a variety of different faiths are 
practiced. Did you know that Friday is a holy day and a day off from work for Muslims? The Friday prayer, 
which starts at noon, takes up a big part of the afternoon. Many Muslim holidays last more than one day. 
A popular Muslim holiday is  al- mawlid  an- nab∫wi, which is the celebration of the prophet Mohammed’s 
birthday. During that holiday, it is customary to distribute candy to children, and many different 
celebrations, such as horse dances, take place in the streets. Other popular holidays are ra’as  as- sana 
(New Year’s) and eid  al- ﬁ SH (Easter), for Arabs of the Christian faith.
mabræk! Congratulations! You’ve done a great job in this course and have just completed its tenth and 
ﬁ nal lesson. You’ve learned a lot of practical vocabulary and useful basic grammar, which now you are all 
ready to put to use. For more practice with conversations, listen to the dialogues. HaDHan sa‘idan! Best 
of luck!
Dialogue
marHaba! Welcome! Here’s your chance to practice all the vocabulary and grammar you’ve mastered in 
ten lessons of Starting Out in Arabic with these ﬁ ve everyday dialogues.
You’ll hear the dialogue ﬁ rst in Arabic at a conversational pace. Listen carefully for meaning. Can you 
get the gist of the conversation? Next, you’ll hear each sentence individually, ﬁ rst in Arabic and then in 
English. This should help ﬁ ll in any gaps in understanding you had the ﬁ rst time. Then, you’ll have a 
chance to listen to each sentence of the dialogue again and repeat it for practice. Finally, you’ll do some 
 role- play by taking part in the same conversation. You’ll ﬁ rst hear the native speaker say a line from the 
dialogue, then you’ll respond appropriately in the pause provided. Have fun!
