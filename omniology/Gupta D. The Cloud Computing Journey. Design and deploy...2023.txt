The history of cloud computing
Cloud computing has a rich history that has evolved over several decades. The concept of cloud computing 
dates back to the 1960s when computer scientists at MIT and Dartmouth College proposed the idea 
of a “utility computing” system that would allow users to access computing resources on demand.
In the 1970s, IBM introduced virtualization technology, which allowed multiple operating systems 
to run on a single mainframe computer. This technology enabled companies to consolidate their IT 
resources and reduce costs.
In the 1990s, the development of the World Wide Web and the rise of e-commerce led to the creation 
of web-based applications and services. This led to the development of early cloud computing 
platforms such as Salesforce, which provided customer relationship management (CRM) services 
over the internet.
In 2002, Amazon launched its web services division, offering cloud-based infrastructure services such 
as storage and computing power. This was followed by the launch of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud 
(EC2) in 2006, which allowed users to rent computing capacity on demand.
In 2008, Google launched its cloud computing platform, Google App Engine, which allowed developers 
to build and run web applications on Google’s infrastructure.

The history of cloud computing
5
Microsoft followed suit in 2010 with the launch of Windows Azure, which provided cloud-based 
services for building and deploying applications.
The growth of cloud computing has been fueled by advances in virtualization technology, which 
allows computing resources to be shared and used more efficiently. The development of cloud-based 
services and infrastructure has also made it easier for businesses to scale their IT resources up or 
down based on demand.
Today, cloud computing has become an integral part of many businesses, offering a range of benefits 
such as cost savings, scalability, flexibility, and improved collaboration. Cloud computing has also 
enabled the development of new technologies such as serverless computing, which allows developers 
to build and run applications without managing servers or infrastructure.
The main idea behind cloud computing was to provide a flexible and cost-effective way for users to 
access computing resources on demand. In the early days of computing, businesses and organizations 
had to invest in their IT infrastructure, including hardware, software, and networking equipment.

managing the virtualization layer, which abstracts the underlying physical hardware and allows for 
the creation and operation of multiple VMs. It acts as a bridge between the physical infrastructure 
and the virtualized environment, providing a layer of isolation and resource allocation.
There are two types of hypervisors – Type 1 and Type 2:
•	 Type 1 hypervisors, also known as bare-metal hypervisors, run directly on the host hardware 
without the need for an underlying operating system. They provide direct access to the hardware 
resources, offering high performance and efficiency. Examples of Type 1 hypervisors are VMware 
ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and KVM.
•	 Type 2 hypervisors, on the other hand, run on top of an existing operating system. They are 
typically used for desktop virtualization or testing and development environments. Type 2 
hypervisors introduce an additional layer of software between the VMs and the hardware, 
resulting in slightly lower performance compared to Type 1 hypervisors. Examples of Type 2 
hypervisors are Oracle VirtualBox and VMware Workstation.
Virtualization allows for the creation of VMs that emulate the behavior of physical servers. Each VM 
operates as an independent entity with its own operating system, applications, and resources. The 
hypervisor manages the allocation of CPU, memory, storage, and network resources to each VM, 
ensuring fair and efficient utilization.
The benefits of virtualization in cloud infrastructure are numerous. First and foremost, it enables server 
consolidation, allowing multiple VMs to run on a single physical server. This leads to improved hardware 
utilization, reduced costs, and energy savings. Virtualization also offers flexibility and agility by allowing 
the easy creation, duplication, and movement of VMs across different physical servers. This flexibility 
enables workload balancing, resource optimization, and efficient scaling of resources based on demand.
Moreover, virtualization enhances the availability and reliability of cloud services. In the event of hardware 
failure or maintenance, VMs can be migrated or restarted on alternate hardware without impacting the 
overall service. This feature, known as live migration, ensures high availability and minimizes downtime.
Security is another aspect that virtualization addresses. By isolating VMs from each other and the 
underlying physical infrastructure, potential security risks are contained within each VM. This isolation 
enhances security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
Virtualization and hypervisors are fundamental components of cloud infrastructure that enable 
efficient resource utilization, flexibility, scalability, and reliability. By abstracting the underlying physical 
hardware, virtualization technology provides the foundation for creating and managing multiple 
VMs in a cloud environment. This technology has revolutionized the way computing resources are 
provisioned and managed, enabling organizations to leverage the benefits of cloud computing and

The following section, Overview of virtualization and containerization, introduces two key concepts in 
cloud computing: virtualization and containerization. We will cover various aspects of virtualization 
and containerization in cloud computing, explore different types of virtualizations, such as hardware 
virtualization and software virtualization, and examine their benefits and use cases in cloud environments.
Overview of virtualization and containerization
This section aims to provide a comprehensive overview of virtualization and containerization in 
cloud computing, equipping you with a solid understanding of these fundamental concepts and their 
significance in modern cloud architectures. We will start by discussing the concept of virtualization 
and its role in creating virtual instances of operating systems and servers. Next, we will delve into 
containerization, which involves encapsulating applications and their dependencies into self-contained 
units called containers. We will explore containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes, 
and understand how they provide lightweight, portable, and isolated execution environments for 
applications. Furthermore, we will examine the advantages and challenges associated with virtualization 
and containerization in cloud computing. We will discuss topics such as resource optimization, 
scalability, security, and application deployment efficiency. We will also explore real-world use cases 
where virtualization and containerization have transformed the way organizations develop, deploy, 
and manage their applications in the cloud.

Components of a Cloud Infrastructure

Cloud computing has emerged as a transformative technology that revolutionizes the way organizations 
store, access, and manage their data and applications. Among the many innovations that drive the 
efficiency and flexibility of cloud computing, virtualization and containerization stand out as fundamental 
pillars. These technologies enable organizations to optimize resource utilization, enhance scalability, 
and streamline application deployment in the cloud. We will delve into the details of virtualization 
and containerization in the context of cloud computing, exploring their key concepts, benefits, and 
use cases.
The following sections explain the key aspects of virtualization and containerization in cloud computing.
Virtualization in cloud computing
Virtualization is a foundational concept in cloud computing that involves creating virtual instances 
of operating systems, servers, or other resources. It allows for the abstraction of underlying physical 
infrastructure, enabling multiple VMs to run concurrently on a single physical server. The hypervisor, 
also known as a VMM, plays a crucial role in managing and allocating resources to each VM. Through 
virtualization, organizations can achieve better utilization of hardware resources, consolidate servers, 
and dynamically allocate resources based on workload demands.
It involves creating virtual instances or VMs that abstract the underlying physical infrastructure, 
allowing multiple VMs to run concurrently on a single physical server. The core concept of virtualization 
lies in the hypervisor, also known as a VMM, which acts as a software layer between the physical 
hardware and the VMs. The hypervisor allocates and manages the physical resources such as CPU, 
memory, storage, and network bandwidth among the VMs. There are two types of hypervisors: Type 
1, or bare-metal, hypervisors, which run directly on the hardware, and Type 2, or hosted, hypervisors, 
which run on top of an operating system. This ensures that each VM has its fair share of resources and 
operates independently of other VMs. This isolation prevents any application or system failures in 
one VM from affecting others. Examples of Type 1 hypervisors include VMware ESXi and Microsoft 
Hyper-V. On the other hand, Type 2 hypervisors are easier to install and manage but may introduce a 
slight overhead due to the additional layer. Examples of Type 2 hypervisors include Oracle VirtualBox 
and VMware Workstation.
With virtualization, organizations can consolidate their servers by running multiple VMs on a single 
physical server. This consolidation leads to improved resource utilization, reduced hardware costs, 
and lower energy consumption. By dynamically allocating resources based on workload demands, 
virtualization enables efficient scalability, allowing organizations to allocate more resources to VMs 
as needed, or migrate VMs across physical servers to balance the workload.
Virtualization also offers benefits in terms of isolation and security. Each VM operates in an isolated 
environment, ensuring that any issues or changes in one VM do not affect others. This isolation provides 
enhanced security by minimizing the impact of potential vulnerabilities or malicious activities. It 
also allows for easier management of different operating systems and software environments within 
separate VMs.

Overview of virtualization and containerization
41
Furthermore, virtualization facilitates workload portability and flexibility. VMs can be easily migrated 
between physical servers without disruption, enabling maintenance, load balancing, and high availability. 
This flexibility allows organizations to adapt their infrastructure to changing demands and optimize 
resource allocation based on application requirements.
Virtualization is a crucial component of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud offerings. Cloud 
service providers leverage virtualization to provide customers with virtualized resources, such as 
virtual servers, storage, and networking, on demand. Users can provision, manage, and scale VMs and 
resources through the cloud provider’s management interface or APIs, without having to worry about 
the underlying physical infrastructure. The following figure depicts the difference between Type 1 and 
Type 2 hypervisors. On the left-hand side, there is a Type 1 hypervisor, also known as a bare-metal 
hypervisor. It is installed directly on the underlying physical hardware and controls the hardware 
resources. VMs run directly on top of the hypervisor, allowing for efficient and direct access to the 
hardware. On the right-hand side, there is a Type 2 hypervisor, also known as a hosted hypervisor. It 
is installed on top of an existing operating system. VMs are then created and run within the hosted 
hypervisor, which acts as an intermediary layer between the VMs and the underlying hardware:
Figure 2.4 – Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors

Components of a Cloud Infrastructure
42
The preceding figure showcases the different approaches to virtualization and the placement of the 
hypervisor within the architecture. It provides a visual representation of how the hypervisor interacts 
with the hardware and facilitates the creation and management of VMs in both Type 1 and Type 2 
hypervisor scenarios.
Now that we have a good idea of hypervisors, we can dig deep into hardware and software virtualization.
Hardware virtualization
Hardware virtualization, also known as server virtualization, abstracts the physical server’s hardware, 
enabling the creation of multiple VMs. Each VM operates independently, running its own operating 
system and applications. This approach allows for efficient resource sharing and isolation, leading 
to improved scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, virtualization facilitates the 
migration of VMs across physical servers, enabling workload balancing and enhancing high availability.
Software virtualization
Software virtualization, on the other hand, focuses on virtualizing specific software components 
rather than entire machines. This approach allows for the creation of virtualized environments for 
applications, databases, or other software components. By encapsulating the software within a virtual 
environment, organizations can achieve portability, ease of management, and isolation of dependencies.
Advantages of virtualization
Virtualization provides several advantages in cloud computing:
•	 Resource optimization: By consolidating multiple VMs onto a single physical server, virtualization 
enables better utilization of hardware resources. This consolidation reduces the need for physical 
servers, resulting in cost savings, reduced power consumption, and a smaller physical footprint 
in data centers.
•	 Scalability: Virtualization allows for the easy and dynamic scaling of resources. With VMs, 
organizations can quickly allocate additional CPU, memory, or storage capacity to meet changing 
demands. This elasticity helps optimize resource allocation and ensures that applications can 
scale up or down as needed without disruption.
•	 Disaster recovery: Virtualization simplifies disaster recovery strategies by allowing for the 
creation of VM snapshots or replica VMs. These snapshots serve as point-in-time backups that 
can be restored in case of system failures or disasters. By leveraging virtualization, organizations 
can recover their systems more efficiently and minimize downtime.
•	 Testing and development: Virtualization provides an ideal environment for testing and 
development purposes. Developers can create multiple VMs with different operating systems 
or software configurations, enabling them to test new applications or conduct experiments 
without impacting the production environment.

Overview of virtualization and containerization
43
•	 Application compatibility: Virtualization facilitates running applications in different operating 
systems and software environments on the same physical hardware. This feature is particularly 
useful for legacy applications that require specific hardware or software configurations. By 
virtualizing these applications, organizations can extend their lifespan and avoid the need for 
costly hardware upgrades or system migrations.
•	 Enhanced security: Virtualization enhances security by isolating applications and operating systems 
within their virtual environments. Any vulnerabilities or breaches in one VM are contained and 
do not affect others. Additionally, VMs can be configured with security features such as firewalls, 
access controls, and intrusion detection systems, further strengthening the overall security posture.
Virtualization is a fundamental technology in cloud computing as it enables the efficient utilization 
of resources, simplifies management, and provides flexibility and scalability. Cloud service providers 
leverage virtualization to offer IaaS, where users can deploy and manage VMs in the cloud. Virtualization 
is a critical enabler for achieving the benefits of cloud computing, such as cost optimization, rapid 
deployment, and scalability, while maintaining high levels of performance and security.
Containerization in cloud computing
Containerization, a more recent innovation in cloud computing, builds upon the principles of 
virtualization but takes a different approach. It involves packaging software applications and their 
dependencies into self-contained units called containers. Each container provides an isolated runtime 
environment that includes the necessary libraries, binaries, and configuration files. Containers are 
lightweight and portable, allowing for seamless execution across different operating systems and cloud 
platforms. At the core of containerization is the container engine or runtime, such as Docker. The 
container engine creates and manages containers, which are instances of pre-configured images. These 
images contain the application code, runtime environment, libraries, and dependencies required for 
the application to run. Containers are isolated from each other and share the host operating system 
kernel, enabling efficient resource utilization and faster startup times compared to traditional VMs.
Docker is one of the most popular containerization technologies that has gained widespread adoption in 
the cloud computing landscape. It simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and managing containers. 
Docker containers offer advantages such as faster application startup, improved resource utilization, and 
easy scaling. The following figure depicts the composition and core components of a container.
At the center of the figure is the container itself, which encapsulates all the necessary components. 
Surrounding the container, several elements are depicted:
•	 Environment: This component represents the underlying infrastructure and resources 
required to support the container. It includes the host operating system, networking, and other 
system-level dependencies.
•	 Code: This component represents the application code that is packaged within the container. 
It includes all the necessary files, scripts, and binaries required to run the application.

Components of a Cloud Infrastructure
44
•	 Runtime: The runtime component refers to the container engine responsible for managing 
and executing the container. It provides an isolated runtime environment for the application 
code to run securely and independently.
•	 Libraries: Libraries are collections of code modules that provide specific functionality to the 
application. They are included within the container to ensure that all required dependencies 
are available for the application to execute properly.
•	 Config: The configuration component represents the settings and parameters that define 
how the container and application should behave. It includes environment variables, network 
configurations, security settings, and other configuration files:
Figure 2.5 – Container composition
The preceding figure showcases the relationship and interdependence of these components within a 
container. It emphasizes that the container combines the application code, required dependencies, 
runtime, and configuration into a single, portable unit that can be easily deployed and executed across 
different environments.
Furthermore, container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes provide advanced capabilities 
for managing large-scale container deployments, automating scaling, load balancing, and application 
health monitoring.
Here are some key concepts and details about containerization in cloud computing:
•	 Container images: A container image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package 
that contains everything needed to run an application, including the application code, runtime 
environment, libraries, and dependencies. Container images are typically created from a base 
image, such as an operating system image, and layered with additional components specific 
to the application. These images can be easily distributed and shared, allowing for seamless 
deployment across different environments.

Overview of virtualization and containerization
45
•	 Container orchestration: Container orchestration platforms, such as Kubernetes, provide management 
and automation capabilities for deploying, scaling, and managing containers at scale. These platforms 
enable efficient resource allocation, load balancing, and high availability of containerized applications. 
They also offer features such as automatic scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates, making it easier 
to manage and maintain containerized applications in a cloud environment.
•	 Portability: Containerization provides application portability, allowing containers to run 
consistently across different environments, including public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises 
infrastructure. Containers abstract the underlying infrastructure, making it easier to migrate 
applications between different cloud providers or on-premises data centers without significant 
modifications. This portability enables flexibility and vendor-agnostic deployment options.
•	 Resource efficiency: Containers are lightweight and share the host operating system kernel, 
which reduces resource overhead compared to traditional VMs. They have faster startup times 
and lower memory footprint, allowing for higher density and more efficient resource utilization 
on the underlying infrastructure. This efficiency is particularly beneficial in cloud environments 
where optimizing resource usage is crucial for cost-effectiveness.
•	 Scalability and elasticity: Containerization enables the easy scaling of applications. By 
leveraging container orchestration platforms, organizations can dynamically scale the number of 
containers based on workload demands. Containers can be quickly spun up or down, ensuring 
that applications can handle varying traffic levels and maintain optimal performance. This 
scalability and elasticity are key factors in cloud computing environments where applications 
need to respond to changing demands.
•	 Application isolation and security: Containers provide isolation between applications and 
their dependencies, preventing conflicts and ensuring that each application runs in its own 
secure environment. The lightweight and isolated nature of containers helps reduce the 
attack surface and improve application security. Additionally, containerization allows for the 
implementation of security measures such as fine-grained access controls, network policies, 
and secure container registries.
Containerization has revolutionized cloud computing by enabling faster application deployment, scalability, 
portability, and resource efficiency. It has become the foundation of modern application development and 
deployment strategies, facilitating the adoption of microservices architecture and enabling organizations 
to build and run cloud-native applications. With its benefits in terms of agility, efficiency, and scalability, 
containerization has become an essential technology for cloud-native and cloud-enabled environments.
Benefits and use cases of virtualization and containerization
Virtualization and containerization offer a multitude of benefits in cloud computing. Firstly, they 
enhance resource utilization by enabling the consolidation of VMs or containers onto a smaller 
number of physical servers. This leads to reduced hardware costs, optimized power consumption, and 
improved scalability. Organizations can dynamically allocate resources based on workload demands, 
scaling up or down as needed without disrupting other services.

Components of a Cloud Infrastructure
46
Secondly, virtualization and containerization facilitate efficient application deployment and management. 
With VMs or containers, organizations can package applications and their dependencies into standardized 
units that are easily deployable and reproducible. This simplifies the process of application deployment, 
reduces conflicts between different software components, and streamlines the management of complex 
application environments.
Moreover, virtualization and containerization contribute to enhanced security and isolation. Each VM or 
container operates in an isolated environment, preventing one application from interfering with others. 
This isolation enhances security by limiting the impact of potential vulnerabilities or malicious activities.
In terms of use cases, virtualization and containerization have transformed various aspects of cloud 
computing. They enable organizations to build scalable and resilient infrastructure, deliver cloud-based 
services efficiently, and support the rapid deployment of applications. Cloud service providers leverage 
virtualization and containerization to deliver IaaS, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-
a-Service (SaaS) offerings.
Virtualization and containerization have become integral components of cloud computing, revolutionizing 
resource management and application deployment. Through virtualization, organizations can optimize 
hardware utilization, achieve workload flexibility, and enhance resource allocation. Containerization, 
on the other hand, provides lightweight, portable, and scalable environments for applications, enabling 
efficient deployment and management. The benefits of virtualization and containerization include 
improved resource utilization, enhanced scalability, simplified application deployment, and enhanced 
security. As cloud computing continues to evolve, these technologies will play a vital role in shaping 
the future of resource management and application delivery in the cloud.
We’ll delve into more details, analysis, and use cases for containerization in cloud computing in the 
following subsections.
Microservices architecture
Containerization is closely aligned with the microservices architecture, where applications are broken 
down into smaller, loosely coupled services. Each service can be encapsulated within a container, 
enabling independent development, deployment, and scalability. Containerization allows organizations 
to efficiently manage and orchestrate these microservices, enabling rapid development, deployment, 
and scaling of individual components without impacting the entire application.
DevOps and CI/CD
Containerization plays a vital role in DevOps practices, enabling the seamless integration and deployment 
of applications. By packaging applications and their dependencies into containers, developers and 
operations teams can work together more effectively. Containers provide consistent environments 
across development, testing, and production, reducing issues caused by differences in environments. 
Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines can be established, automating 
the process of building, testing, and deploying containers, thereby accelerating the software delivery 
life cycle.

Hybrid and multi-cloud deployments
Containerization simplifies the deployment of applications in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. 
Containers abstract the underlying infrastructure, enabling applications to be deployed consistently 
across different cloud providers or on-premises infrastructure. Organizations can leverage container 
orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes to manage and deploy containers seamlessly across multiple 
environments, ensuring flexibility, workload portability, and optimal resource utilization.
Scalable and elastic applications
Containerization allows applications to scale dynamically based on workload demands. With container 
orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes, organizations can automatically scale the number of 
containers up or down to handle varying traffic levels. Containers are lightweight and can be rapidly 
provisioned, enabling fast and efficient scaling, and ensuring that applications can handle increased 
user demands while maintaining optimal performance.
Fault tolerance and high availability
Container orchestration platforms provide built-in capabilities for fault tolerance and high availability. 
Containers can be replicated across multiple nodes or availability zones, ensuring that applications 
can withstand failures and continue running without interruption. Orchestration platforms such as 
Kubernetes monitor the health of containers and automatically restart or relocate them in case of 
failures, enhancing the overall reliability and availability of containerized applications.
Testing and QA environments
Containerization facilitates the creation of isolated testing and QA environments. Developers can 
package the application and its dependencies into containers, ensuring consistent environments for 
testing purposes. Containers can be easily spun up and torn down, providing on-demand and disposable 
testing environments. This enables organizations to conduct efficient testing, identify issues early in 
the development cycle, and accelerate the release of high-quality software.
Resource efficiency and cost savings
Containerization offers resource efficiency and cost savings compared to traditional VM-based 
deployments. Containers have a smaller footprint, faster startup times, and lower memory overhead. 
Multiple containers can run on a single host, maximizing resource utilization. This efficiency leads to 
cost savings by reducing infrastructure requirements and optimizing cloud spend.

48
Legacy application modernization
Containerization allows organizations to modernize legacy applications by encapsulating them within 
containers. By doing so, legacy applications can take advantage of the benefits of containerization, such 
as scalability, portability, and improved resource utilization. Containerization provides a pathway for 
migrating monolithic applications to a more modular and scalable architecture, paving the way for 
future enhancements and modernization efforts.
Containerization in cloud computing offers numerous advantages, including enabling microservices 
architecture, streamlining DevOps practices, supporting hybrid and multi-cloud deployments, facilitating 
scalable and elastic applications, providing fault tolerance and high availability, enhancing testing and 
QA environments, optimizing resource utilization and cost savings, and enabling legacy application 
modernization. These benefits make containerization a key technology for modern cloud-native and 
cloud-enabled applications, driving agility, efficiency, and scalability in the cloud computing landscape.
Understanding the difference between virtualization and 
containerization
Virtualization and containerization are two distinct technologies that are used in cloud computing, each 
with its characteristics and use cases. Here’s a comparison of the key differences between virtualization 
and containerization.
•	 Architecture and abstraction level:
	 Virtualization: Virtualization operates at the infrastructure level. It creates a virtual layer 
between the physical hardware and the operating system, allowing multiple VMs to run on a 
single physical server. Each VM runs its own operating system and applications, simulating 
a complete computing environment.
	 Containerization: Containerization operates at the application level. It encapsulates 
applications and their dependencies into isolated containers. Containers share the same 
operating system kernel, but each container appears as a separate and isolated instance, 
running its own processes and resources.
•	 Resource utilization:
	 Virtualization: VMs require a dedicated amount of system resources, including memory, 
storage, and processing power. Each VM runs a full-fledged operating system, which can 
result in higher resource consumption and slower startup times.
	 Containerization: Containers are lightweight and share the host system’s operating system 
kernel. They consume fewer resources, as they do not require a separate operating system 
instance. Containers have faster startup times and can be provisioned and scaled more quickly.

Overview of virtualization and containerization
49
•	 Isolation and security:
	 Virtualization: VMs provide stronger isolation between instances as they operate with separate 
operating system instances. This isolation offers better security and prevents applications in 
one VM from affecting others.
	 Containerization: Containers provide a level of isolation, but they share the same operating 
system kernel. While this shared kernel may introduce a potential security risk, containerization 
technologies employ various security mechanisms, such as namespaces and control groups, 
to enforce isolation between containers.
•	 Application portability:
	 Virtualization: VMs are highly portable, allowing applications to run on different physical 
servers or hypervisors with minimal modification. However, there may be dependencies on 
specific hardware or hypervisor configurations.
	 Containerization: Containers are designed for portability. Applications packaged in containers 
can run consistently across different environments, including different operating systems 
and cloud platforms, so long as the host system supports the containerization runtime (for 
example, Docker or Kubernetes).
•	 Performance:
	 Virtualization: VMs have a slight performance overhead due to the emulation of hardware 
and the presence of a complete operating system instance
	 Containerization: Containers have lower overhead as they share the host system’s operating 
system kernel, resulting in faster performance and better utilization of system resources
•	 Use cases:
	 Virtualization: Virtualization is well suited for running multiple applications with different 
operating system requirements on a single physical server. It is commonly used for server 
consolidation, running legacy applications, and managing complex network topologies.
	 Containerization: Containerization excels in deploying and scaling cloud-native applications, 
microservices architecture, and DevOps practices. It enables efficient resource utilization, 
fast application deployment, and portability across different environments.

The following figure depicts the architectural difference between virtualization and containerization:
Figure 2.6 – VMs versus containers
VMs and containers have distinct differences. VMs operate on a hypervisor layer, utilizing separate 
guest operating systems, resulting in higher resource overhead. In contrast, containers share the 
host operating system, making them lightweight with reduced resource utilization. VMs offer strong 
isolation, while containers provide process-level isolation. VMs have higher performance overhead, 
while containers perform better due to direct resource usage. VMs are highly portable but face 
compatibility challenges, whereas containers excel in portability. VMs scale by adding or removing 
instances, while containers enable rapid scaling. VMs require separate management tools, while 
containers can be managed with container orchestration platforms. Understanding these differences 
aids in selecting the appropriate technology based on specific needs and considerations.
Virtualization and containerization offer different approaches to resource isolation, application 
deployment, and management in cloud computing. Virtualization operates at the infrastructure 
level, providing full operating system instances for each VM, while containerization operates at the 
application level, encapsulating applications and sharing the host operating system. Both technologies 
have their advantages and use cases, and the choice depends on factors such as workload requirements, 
resource utilization, portability needs, and security considerations.

Summary
Overall, this chapter provided a comprehensive overview of cloud architecture and the key components 
that are essential for building a successful cloud environment.
In this chapter, we explored two crucial topics in cloud computing: essential cloud infrastructure 
components and an overview of virtualization and containerization.

Compute resources form a fundamental aspect of cloud computing, serving as the backbone for 
executing applications and services in the cloud environment. In this topic, we will explore compute 
models that enable organizations to leverage the scalability, flexibility, and efficiency of the cloud.
In the following sections, we will look at the widely known compute resources.
Virtual machines (VMs)
We discussed VMs briefly in the previous chapter, so let’s talk about them in some more detail in this 
section. VMs are software emulations of physical computers that enable multiple operating systems 
and applications to run simultaneously on a single physical server. VMs provide a layer of abstraction 
between the hardware and the operating system, allowing for better resource utilization and flexibility 
in the cloud computing environment.
Key characteristics of VMs include the following:
•	 Isolation: VMs provide strong isolation between different instances running on the same 
physical server. Each VM operates independently and is isolated from other VMs, ensuring 
that a failure or issue in one VM does not affect others.
•	 Virtualization: VMs leverage virtualization technology to emulate the hardware components of 
a physical computer, including CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces. This abstraction 
allows for the efficient sharing of physical resources among multiple VMs.
•	 Compatibility: VMs can run different operating systems and applications, making them 
versatile for organizations with diverse software requirements. This compatibility enables the 
consolidation of various workloads onto a single physical server, reducing hardware costs and 
simplifying management.
•	 Resource allocation: VMs allow for granular control over resource allocation. System 
administrators can allocate specific amounts of CPU, memory, and storage to each VM based 
on its workload requirements. This flexibility ensures that resources are efficiently utilized and 
scaled according to the demands of the applications.
•	 Mobility: VMs offer the capability to migrate or move instances from one physical server to 
another without interrupting their operation. This mobility feature allows for load balancing, 
hardware maintenance, and disaster recovery scenarios.
•	 Snapshots and cloning: VMs support the creation of snapshots, which capture the state of a 
VM at a specific point in time. These snapshots can be used for backups, testing, and reverting 
to a previous configuration if needed. VM cloning allows for the rapid provisioning of multiple 
instances with the same configuration, simplifying deployment processes.

VMs play a crucial role in cloud computing by enabling organizations to achieve better hardware 
utilization, flexibility, and scalability. They offer the ability to run multiple operating systems and 
applications on a single physical server, providing efficient resource allocation and isolation. With their 
compatibility and mobility features, VMs facilitate workload consolidation, system maintenance, and 
disaster recovery strategies. Let’s see how it is typically placed in a cloud environment. The following 
figure depicts the typical layout of a VM in a cloud environment. In the figure, T3 is the EC2 instance, 
a VM in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud environment:
Figure 3.1 – VM layout in an AWS environment
Using VMs in cloud computing offers several benefits that contribute to the efficiency, flexibility, and 
scalability of the infrastructure. Some key benefits of using VMs include the following:
•	 Resource optimization: VMs allow for better utilization of physical server resources by enabling 
multiple VMs to run concurrently on a single server. This consolidation leads to improved 
hardware efficiency, reduced power consumption, and cost savings.
•	 Flexibility and compatibility: VMs provide the flexibility to run different operating systems 
and applications on the same physical infrastructure. This compatibility allows organizations 
to deploy and manage diverse software environments, accommodating a wide range of 
application requirements.
•	 Isolation and security: VMs offer strong isolation between different instances running on 
the same physical server. Each VM operates independently, providing enhanced security by 
preventing one VM from accessing or interfering with the resources of another. This isolation 
helps in containing security breaches and minimizing the impact of vulnerabilities.

Introduction to compute and storage in cloud computing
59
•	 Scalability and elasticity: VMs enable easy scalability by allowing organizations to quickly 
provision new instances as the demand for computing resources increases. Scaling can be 
achieved by adding more VMs or adjusting the resources allocated to existing VMs, providing 
the flexibility to meet changing workload requirements.
•	 Disaster recovery and high availability: VMs facilitate efficient disaster recovery strategies. 
VM snapshots and backups can be taken to capture the state of a VM at a specific point in 
time, allowing for quick restoration in the event of system failures or data loss. Additionally, 
VM mobility enables seamless migration of instances between physical servers, supporting 
high availability configurations.
•	 Testing and development: VMs are valuable for testing and development environments. They 
allow developers to create isolated sandboxes, replicate production environments, and quickly 
provision new instances for testing purposes. VMs provide a cost-effective and efficient way to 
experiment with different configurations and software versions.
•	 Simplified management: VMs offer centralized management and administration of computing 
resources. System administrators can leverage management tools to provision, monitor, and 
control VM instances from a single interface, streamlining management tasks and reducing 
operational complexity.
The use of VMs in cloud computing provides organizations with increased flexibility, resource 
optimization, security, scalability, and simplified management. These benefits contribute to the overall 
efficiency and effectiveness of cloud infrastructure, enabling organizations to meet their computing 
needs in a more agile and cost-effective manner.
Let’s understand how we can deploy a VM on a cloud platform. To deploy a VM in a cloud environment 
such as Azure, you can follow these general steps (I’ll provide an example using the Azure cloud platform):
1.	
Sign in to the Azure portal: Go to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) 
and sign in with your Azure account.
2.	
Create a resource group: A resource group is a logical container for resources. It helps you 
manage and organize resources in your Azure subscription. Create a new resource group or 
use an existing one if you have already created it.
An example in the Azure CLI is as follows:
az group create –name MyResourceGroup –location eastus
3.	
Choose the VM image: Select the operating system and VM image you want to use. Azure 
provides a variety of images, including Windows Server, Ubuntu, CentOS, and so on.
An example in Azure CLI is as follows:
az vm image list --output table

Compute
60
4.	
Create the VM: Choose a name for your VM, determine the size (hardware configuration), 
and specify the login credentials (username and password or SSH key) for accessing the VM.
An example in Azure CLI is as follows:
az vm create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name 
MyVirtualMachine --image UbuntuLTS --size Standard_B2s --admin-
username azureuser --admin-password MyPassword1234
5.	
Configure network settings: Specify the network settings such as virtual network, subnet, public 
IP (if needed), and network security group rules (firewall settings).
An example in Azure CLI (creating a new virtual network and subnet) is as follows:
az network vnet create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name 
MyVnet --address-prefix 192.168.0.0/16 --subnet-name MySubnet 
--subnet-prefix 192.168.1.0/24
6.	
Assign a public IP (optional): If you want your VM to have a public IP address to access it over 
the internet, you can allocate a public IP and associate it with your VM.
An example in Azure CLI is as follows:
az network public-ip create --resource-group MyResourceGroup 
--name MyPublicIP --sku Standard
az network nic ip-config update --resource-group MyResourceGroup 
--nic-name MyVirtualMachineVMNic --name ipconfig1 --public-ip 
MyPublicIP
7.	
Open ports (optional): If you need specific ports to be accessible from the internet, configure 
network security group (NSG) rules to allow incoming traffic.
An example in Azure CLI (allowing SSH traffic on port 22) is as follows:
az network nsg rule create --resource-group MyResourceGroup 
--nsg-name MyNetworkSecurityGroup --name AllowSSH --protocol 
Tcp --direction Inbound --priority 1000 --source-address-prefix 
'*' --source-port-range '*' --destination-address-prefix '*' 
--destination-port-range 22 --access Allow
8.	
Connect to the VM: Once the VM is deployed, you can connect to it using remote desktop 
(RDP) for Windows VMs or SSH for Linux VMs. Use the public IP address or the fully qualified 
domain name (FQDN) to connect.
That’s it! You now have a VM running in the Azure cloud environment. Remember to manage your 
resources efficiently and stop or deallocate the VM when not in use to avoid unnecessary costs.
Deploying a VM in the AWS environment involves similar steps as in Azure. The following steps 
highlight the process to deploy a VM in AWS, along with corresponding AWS CLI examples:
1.	
Sign in to the AWS console: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.
com/console/) and sign in with your AWS account.

Introduction to compute and storage in cloud computing
61
2.	
Choose a region: Select the AWS region where you want to deploy your VM. Each region has 
its own availability zones, which are distinct data centers within the region.
3.	
Create a virtual private cloud (VPC): A VPC is a virtual network that allows you to isolate and 
control networking resources for your AWS resources. Create a new VPC or use an existing one.
An example in AWS CLI is as follows:
aws ec2 create-vpc –cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16
4.	
Create a subnet within the VPC: Create a subnet where your VM will reside. Each subnet is 
associated with a specific availability zone.
An example in AWS CLI is as follows:
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <VPC-ID> --cidr-block 10.0.1.0/24 
--availability-zone us-east-1a
5.	
Choose the VM image: Select the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that corresponds to the 
operating system and software you want to run on the VM.
An example in AWS CLI (listing available AMIs) is as follows:
aws ec2 describe-images --owners amazon --query 
"Images[?Architecture=='x86_64' && VirtualizationType=='hvm' && 
RootDeviceType=='ebs']"
6.	
Create the VM: Specify the instance type (hardware configuration), IAM role (if required for 
specific permissions), security groups (firewall settings), and other details.
An example in AWS CLI is as follows:
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id <AMI-ID> --count 1 --instance-
type t2.micro --key-name MyKeyPair --security-group-ids 
<Security-Group-ID> --subnet-id <Subnet-ID> --associate-public-
ip-address
7.	
Allocate a public IP (optional): By default, an EC2 instance in a public subnet will get a public 
IP. However, for instances in private subnets, you may need to assign an Elastic IP (EIP) and 
associate it with your instance.
An example in AWS CLI is as follows:
aws ec2 allocate-address
aws ec2 associate-address --instance-id <Instance-ID> 
--public-ip <EIP>
8.	
Open ports (optional): Configure security group rules to allow incoming traffic to specific 
ports, similar to NSG rules in Azure.
An example in AWS CLI (allowing SSH traffic on port 22) is as follows:
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <Security-
Group-ID> --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0

Compute
62
9.	
Connect to the VM: Once the VM is deployed, connect to it using SSH for Linux instances or 
RDP for Windows instances. Use the public IP or EIP associated with the instance.
That’s it! Now you have a VM running in the AWS environment. Again, remember to manage your 
resources efficiently, and stop or terminate instances when not in use to control costs.
VMs are widely used in various use cases within cloud computing, providing solutions for legacy 
application migration and workload isolation. Let’s delve into these use cases and understand 
their significance:
•	 Legacy application migration: Many organizations have legacy applications that were designed 
to run on specific hardware or operating systems. Virtualization technology enables these 
legacy applications to be migrated to VMs, eliminating the need for dedicated hardware. By 
encapsulating the entire application environment within a VM, organizations can run their 
legacy applications on modern infrastructure, benefiting from improved scalability, resource 
utilization, and easier management. This approach also ensures that the legacy applications 
remain functional without the need for extensive modifications.
•	 Workload isolation: In cloud computing environments, workload isolation is crucial to ensure 
the stability and security of applications. VMs offer strong isolation between different workloads 
running on the same physical infrastructure. Each VM operates as an independent entity 
with its own dedicated resources, operating system, and application stack. Workload isolation 
helps prevent resource conflicts, performance degradation, and security breaches. It allows 
organizations to securely host multiple applications or services on a single physical server while 
ensuring that failures or issues in one VM do not affect others.
•	 Test and development environments: VMs are commonly used for creating isolated test and 
development environments. Developers can provision VMs quickly, replicate production 
environments, and experiment with different configurations or software versions. VM snapshots 
and clones allow developers to roll back to a known state, making it easier to test and debug 
applications without impacting the production environment. By using VMs for testing and 
development, organizations can ensure better software quality, accelerate application development 
cycles, and minimize the risk of conflicts between development and production environments.
•	 Scalability and elasticity: VMs provide scalability and elasticity to accommodate changing 
workload demands. With VMs, organizations can easily provision or deprovision instances 
based on workload requirements. This flexibility enables them to scale resources up or down 
quickly, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency. By leveraging VMs, organizations can 
dynamically allocate computing resources, respond to spikes in demand, and meet fluctuating 
workload needs without disrupting existing services.

Introduction to compute and storage in cloud computing
63
•	 Hybrid cloud deployment: VMs are instrumental in hybrid cloud deployments, where 
organizations use a combination of on-premises infrastructure and public cloud services. VMs 
enable workload portability between private and public clouds, allowing seamless migration 
of applications and data. This flexibility allows organizations to leverage the benefits of both 
environments, such as maintaining sensitive data on-premises while utilizing public cloud 
scalability for certain workloads. VMs provide a common abstraction layer, facilitating the 
integration and management of hybrid cloud deployments.
VMs offer versatile solutions for legacy application migration, workload isolation, test and development 
environments, scalability, and hybrid cloud deployments. By leveraging VM technology, organizations 
can optimize resource utilization, enhance application portability, improve security, and achieve greater 
flexibility in managing their computing workloads within the cloud environment.
In the world of virtualization, two popular VM technologies stand out: VMware and Hyper-V. Let’s 
delve into an overview of these technologies and understand their key features and capabilities.

you can enable this feature in Hyper-V. This is useful for scenarios such as running Docker 
within a VM.
Remember that Hyper-V is a powerful tool that allows you to create and manage virtualized environments 
on Windows machines, enabling you to run multiple operating systems and applications in isolated 
environments for testing, development, or production purposes.
The previous section covered VMware, Hyper-V, and VMs, and you learned about leading virtualization 
platforms that enable the creation and management of multiple virtual environments on a single physical 
host. VMs were introduced as self-contained instances of an operating system, offering benefits such as 
resource optimization, cost savings, and simplified testing and development. The section highlighted 
the versatility of VMs in various use cases, including software testing, application development, and 
server consolidation. You also understood the significance of choosing the appropriate virtualization 
solution based on specific needs and project requirements.
Containers
Containerization technology, exemplified by popular tools such as Docker and Kubernetes, has 
revolutionized the way applications are developed, deployed, and managed in the cloud computing 
landscape. Containers provide lightweight and isolated runtime environments for applications, 
encapsulating the application and its dependencies. Containerization technology, such as Docker, 
enables developers to package applications with their libraries, frameworks, and configurations, 
ensuring consistent execution across different environments. Containers offer advantages such as 
portability, scalability, and faster application deployment. Container orchestration platforms such as 
Kubernetes provide automated management, scaling, and networking capabilities for containerized 
applications. Containers are particularly suitable for microservices architecture, where applications 
are divided into smaller, loosely coupled components. They facilitate agile development, continuous 
integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and efficient resource utilization.
Containers offer several advantages in terms of portability and resource efficiency, making them a 
preferred choice for application deployment in cloud computing environments. Let’s explore these 
advantages in detail:
•	 Consistent environment: Containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies into a 
single package, ensuring consistency across different environments. Applications developed in 
containers can be easily deployed and run on various platforms, including local development 
machines, VMs, and cloud infrastructure.

Compute
66
•	 Elimination of dependency issues: Containers include all the necessary libraries and dependencies 
within their image, removing the need to worry about compatibility issues with the underlying 
host system. This makes it easier to move applications across different environments without 
concerns about compatibility or dependency conflicts.
•	 Easy replication: Containers can be easily replicated and distributed across different systems, 
enabling seamless migration between development, testing, and production environments. 
This portability allows for efficient scaling and deployment of applications, promoting agile 
development and deployment practices.
•	 Lightweight: Containers are lightweight compared to VMs, as they share the host system’s 
kernel and utilize its resources efficiently. Each container operates in its isolated environment, 
consuming only the necessary resources for the application to run, resulting in reduced overhead 
and improved resource utilization.
•	 Rapid startup and scaling: Containers have faster startup times compared to VMs since they 
don’t require booting an entire operating system. Containers can be quickly spun up or down 
based on demand, enabling rapid scaling of applications to handle varying workloads efficiently.
•	 Efficient resource allocation: Container orchestration platforms, such as Kubernetes, optimize 
resource allocation by dynamically assigning containers to hosts based on resource availability and 
application requirements. This ensures efficient utilization of computing resources, minimized 
wasted capacity, and reduced costs.
Let’s understand how we can create a container in a cloud environment such as Google Cloud Platform 
(GCP). Creating a container in Google Cloud typically involves using Google Kubernetes Engine 
(GKE), a managed Kubernetes service provided by GCP. Kubernetes is an open source container 
orchestration platform that allows you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. Here 
are the steps to create a container in Google Cloud using GKE:
1.	
Set up a Google Cloud project: If you don’t have a Google Cloud account, create one and set 
up a new project within the Google Cloud console.
2.	
Enable GKE: Within your Google Cloud project, navigate to the GKE section in the Cloud 
console and enable the Kubernetes Engine API.
3.	
Install and set up Google Cloud SDK (gcloud): Install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. 
This SDK allows you to interact with your Google Cloud resources from the command line.
4.	
Authenticate with Google Cloud: After installing the SDK, use the gcloud auth login 
command to authenticate yourself with your Google Cloud account.
5.	
Create a Kubernetes cluster: Use the gcloud container clusters create command 
to create a Kubernetes cluster in GKE. You can specify various options such as the number of 
nodes, the machine types, and the GCP zone where the cluster will be located.
6.	
Configure kubectl: Install the Kubernetes kubectl command-line tool and configure it to 
use the newly created GKE cluster. You can use the gcloud container clusters 
get-credentials command to set up kubectl.

Introduction to compute and storage in cloud computing
67
7.	
Create a Docker container: Before deploying your application to the Kubernetes cluster, you 
need to have your application containerized using Docker. Create a Dockerfile for your 
application, and then build a Docker image using the docker build command.
8.	
Push the Docker image to a container registry: Store the Docker image in a container registry, 
such as Google Container Registry (GCR) or Docker Hub. In the case of GCR, use the gcloud 
docker -- push command to push your Docker image to GCR.
9.	
Create Kubernetes deployment: Create a Kubernetes deployment YAML file that describes how 
your container should be deployed. This file specifies the container image to use, the number 
of replicas, networking, and other settings.
10.	 Apply the Kubernetes deployment: Use the kubectl apply command to deploy your 
application to the Kubernetes cluster. This command will create the specified number of replicas 
of your container.
11.	 Expose the deployment (optional): If you want to make your application accessible from outside 
the cluster, you can expose it using a Kubernetes Service. This will create a stable endpoint 
(LoadBalancer, NodePort, or ClusterIP) that can be accessed externally.
That’s it! Now your containerized application is running on GKE. You can scale, update, and manage 
the application easily through the Kubernetes API or the GKE web console.
By leveraging the advantages of portability and resource efficiency, containers enable organizations 
to streamline application development, deployment, and management processes. They promote 
a modular and scalable approach to building applications, allowing teams to focus on innovation

Containers have gained popularity in the realm of cloud computing due to their versatility and 
numerous use cases. Let’s explore some of the prominent use cases for containers.
Use cases for containers
This section delves into the diverse and valuable applications of containers across different industries 
and environments. By examining real-world scenarios, this section highlights the benefits of using 
containers for efficient software deployment, microservices architecture, scaling applications, and 
simplifying the management of complex systems. Whether in cloud-native development, DevOps 
practices, or hybrid infrastructure setups, containers prove to be a versatile and essential technology:
•	 Microservices architecture: Containers are well-suited for implementing microservices architecture 
where applications are decomposed into smaller, independent services. Each microservice 
runs in its own container, enabling scalability, flexibility, and ease of deployment. Containers 
allow developers to build, test, and deploy microservices independently, promoting agility and 
modular development practices.
•	 Application deployment and isolation: Containers provide an efficient way to package applications 
and their dependencies into portable units. With containers, developers can encapsulate an 
application, including its libraries, dependencies, and runtime environment, ensuring consistency 
across different environments. Containers simplify the deployment process, allowing applications 
to run reliably and consistently across various platforms, from development to production.
•	 Hybrid and multi-cloud deployments: Containers enable seamless application deployment 
and portability across different cloud providers and environments. Organizations can leverage 
containers to build hybrid and multi-cloud architectures, distributing workloads across multiple 
clouds or on-premises infrastructure. Containers abstract the underlying infrastructure, making 
it easier to migrate applications between different environments without significant modifications.

Introduction to compute and storage in cloud computing
71
These are just a few examples of how containers can be used in various scenarios within cloud 
computing. Containers offer flexibility, scalability, and portability, making them a valuable tool for 
modern application development, deployment, and management. With their lightweight nature and 
efficient resource utilization, containers have revolutionized the way applications are built, deployed, 
and scaled in cloud environments.
Serverless computing
Serverless computing, also known as function as a service (FaaS), is a cloud computing model where 
developers focus on writing and deploying functions without the need to manage the underlying 
infrastructure. In serverless computing, functions are executed in response to specific events or 
triggers, and the cloud provider dynamically allocates resources to handle the workload. This model 
eliminates the need for provisioning and managing servers, allowing developers to focus on writing 
code. Serverless computing offers benefits such as automatic scaling, reduced operational overhead, 
and pay-per-use pricing. AWS Lambda and Azure Functions are popular serverless platforms that 
enable organizations to build event-driven applications, backend services, and APIs without worrying 
about infrastructure management.
Here are some key aspects and details to understand about serverless computing:
•	 Event-driven architecture: Serverless computing follows an event-driven architecture where functions 
are triggered by specific events or requests. These events can include HTTP requests, database 
updates, file uploads, or scheduled tasks. When an event occurs, the associated function is executed 
and the required resources are automatically provisioned and managed by the cloud provider.
•	 Pay-per-use model: Serverless platforms typically charge users based on the actual usage of their 
functions, rather than charging for idle resources. This pay-per-use model offers cost savings, 
as organizations only pay for the actual execution time as well as the resources consumed by 
their functions. It also allows for automatic scaling, where additional instances of the function 
are created as the demand increases.
•	 Function scalability: Serverless platforms are designed to handle scalable workloads. Functions 
automatically scale up or down based on the incoming workload, ensuring optimal performance 
and resource utilization. The cloud provider manages the infrastructure scaling behind the 
scenes, allowing developers to focus on writing the code.
•	 Stateless execution: Serverless functions are stateless, meaning they don’t maintain any persistent 
state or context between invocations. Each function execution is independent and isolated, 
making it easier to scale and distribute requests. If state needs to be maintained, it can be stored 
in external databases or services, such as object storage or a database as a service (DBaaS).
•	 Vendor-specific implementations: Different cloud providers offer their own serverless computing 
platforms, such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions. While the 
underlying principles remain the same, there may be variations in programming languages, 
runtime environments, and additional services provided by each vendor.

Compute
72
•	 Use cases: Serverless computing is well-suited for event-driven, lightweight, and scalable 
applications. It is commonly used for tasks such as data processing, real-time file processing, 
microservices architectures, chatbots, API integrations, and IoT data processing. The serverless 
model allows developers to focus on writing the business logic without worrying about server 
management and infrastructure maintenance.
•	 Development and deployment: Developers typically write serverless functions using supported 
programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, or Java. The functions are packaged into 
deployment artifacts and uploaded to the serverless platform. The cloud provider handles the 
deployment, scaling, and execution of the functions, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
Serverless computing offers several advantages, including reduced operational overhead, automatic 
scalability, cost optimization, and faster time-to-market. By abstracting away infrastructure management, 
serverless computing enables developers to focus on building application logic, increases development 
agility, and allows organizations to optimize resource usage and costs.
Serverless computing, or FaaS, offers numerous benefits that can greatly enhance application development 
and deployment. Here are the key benefits of serverless computing:
•	 Reduced operational overhead: With serverless computing, developers no longer need to manage 
or provision servers, operating systems, or infrastructure components. The cloud provider takes 
care of these tasks, allowing developers to focus solely on writing the application logic. This 
reduction in operational overhead translates to less time spent on infrastructure management 
and maintenance, enabling teams to be more productive and efficient.
•	 Cost optimization: Serverless computing follows a pay-per-use model, where users are billed 
based on the actual execution time and resources consumed by their functions. This means 
organizations only pay for the exact amount of resources needed to handle their workload, 
eliminating the cost of idle resources. Additionally, serverless platforms automatically scale 
functions based on demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization and cost efficiency.
•	 Auto-scaling: Serverless platforms have built-in auto-scaling capabilities, allowing functions 
to scale up or down based on the incoming workload. As the number of requests increases, 
additional instances of the function are automatically provisioned to handle the load. Conversely, 
when the workload decreases, the platform scales down the resources to avoid unnecessary 
costs. This auto-scaling feature ensures that applications can handle sudden spikes in traffic 
without any manual intervention.
•	 Improved developer productivity: Serverless computing allows developers to focus solely 
on writing the business logic of their applications without worrying about infrastructure 
management. This improves developer productivity as they can dedicate more time to coding 
and building features, rather than dealing with server setup, configuration, and maintenance 
tasks. It also promotes faster development cycles and shorter time-to-market for applications.

Introduction to compute and storage in cloud computing
73
•	 High availability and fault tolerance: Serverless platforms inherently provide high availability and 
fault tolerance. Functions are automatically distributed across multiple availability zones, ensuring 
that they can withstand failures in specific data centers or regions. If a function instance fails, the 
platform automatically spins up a new instance to handle subsequent requests. This built-in resilience 
ensures that applications remain highly available, reducing the risk of downtime and data loss.
•	 Scalability and elasticity: Serverless platforms excel at handling variable workloads and sudden 
spikes in traffic. Functions can scale almost instantly to accommodate increased demand and 
then scale back down when the load decreases. This scalability and elasticity enable organizations 
to handle unpredictable or bursty workloads without over-provisioning resources, leading to 
improved performance and user experience.
•	 Seamless integration with other services: Serverless computing integrates well with other 
cloud services and components. It enables developers to easily connect functions with storage 
services, databases, messaging systems, event streams, and other cloud resources. This seamless 
integration allows for the creation of powerful and complex applications that leverage the full 
capabilities of the cloud ecosystem.
Serverless computing offers several significant benefits, including reduced operational overhead, 
cost optimization, auto-scaling, improved developer productivity, high availability, fault tolerance, 
scalability, and seamless integration. These advantages make serverless computing an attractive option 
for organizations looking to streamline their application development processes, optimize resource 
utilization, and achieve greater efficiency in the cloud environment.
FaaS platforms, such as AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, are at the forefront of serverless computing, 
offering developers a powerful and scalable environment to deploy and run their code. Here are some 
details on FaaS platforms.

compute and storage
In this section, we will explore the key factors to consider when designing and provisioning compute 
and storage resources in the cloud, along with effective strategies to optimize costs. By the end of 
this section, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the various considerations involved in 
selecting the right compute and storage resources for their workloads. You will learn how to analyze 
workload requirements, scale resources efficiently, ensure optimal performance, and enhance availability 
and data durability. Moreover, you will gain valuable insights into cost optimization techniques, such 
as rightsizing resources, leveraging pricing models, and implementing storage tiering and life cycle 
policies. Armed with this knowledge, you will be equipped to make informed decisions and implement 
strategies to optimize your compute and storage resources, achieving a balance between cost efficiency 
and performance in your cloud deployments.
One of the key considerations is workload requirements. It is essential to understand the specific 
needs of the workload, such as CPU and memory requirements, I/O demands, and storage capacity. 
By analyzing workload characteristics, organizations can identify the most suitable compute and 
storage options that align with their performance expectations.
Scalability is another vital aspect to consider. Cloud environments should be able to handle workload 
growth and fluctuations effectively. Elasticity, the ability to scale resources up or down based on demand, 
is a desirable feature to ensure efficient resource utilization and cost savings. Choosing compute and 
storage services that offer seamless scalability, such as auto-scaling groups or storage scaling policies, 
can facilitate the management of workload spikes and provide flexibility in resource allocation.
Availability and data durability are critical considerations for mission-critical applications. High 
availability can be achieved through redundant compute instances or storage solutions with built-in 
replication and backup capabilities. It is crucial to evaluate the service-level agreements (SLAs) 
provided by cloud providers to ensure they meet the required uptime and data durability requirements.
Cost optimization plays a significant role in cloud infrastructure decision-making. Organizations 
need to assess the cost implications of compute and storage options and identify opportunities for 
optimization. Rightsizing resources involves matching the resource allocation to the actual workload 
demands to avoid overprovisioning. This can lead to cost savings by eliminating unnecessary resources. 
Understanding pricing models, such as on-demand, reserved instances, or spot instances, and utilizing 
pricing calculators can help optimize costs. Additionally, implementing storage tiering and life cycle 
policies, where less frequently accessed data is moved to lower-cost storage tiers, can provide further 
cost optimizations.
Considerations for security and compliance are crucial in compute and storage selection. Organizations 
must assess the security features and controls offered by cloud providers, such as encryption, access 
management, and data protection mechanisms. Compliance requirements, such as industry-specific 
regulations or data residency, should also be taken into account.

Storage
102
Workload requirements analysis is a crucial aspect of selecting compute and storage resources in 
cloud infrastructure. It involves understanding and analyzing the specific needs and characteristics 
of the workloads that will be running in the cloud environment. This analysis helps determine the 
appropriate compute and storage resources that can effectively meet the workload demands.
To perform workload requirements analysis, several factors need to be considered:
•	 Performance requirements: It is essential to assess the performance needs of the workloads, 
such as CPU, memory, and storage requirements. Different workloads have varying performance 
demands, and understanding these requirements ensures that the chosen compute and storage 
resources can handle the workload efficiently.
•	 Data storage and retrieval: Workloads may have varying data storage and retrieval patterns. 
Some workloads may require high-speed access to data, while others may involve large-scale 
data processing or long-term archival. Assessing the data storage requirements helps determine 
the appropriate storage solutions, such as block storage, file storage, or object storage, that can 
efficiently handle the workload’s data needs.
•	 Compliance and security: Depending on the nature of the workloads and industry regulations, 
compliance and security requirements may come into play. Workloads dealing with sensitive 
data or subject to specific compliance standards need to adhere to appropriate security measures. 
Evaluating the security capabilities of compute and storage resources ensures that the chosen 
options meet the workload’s compliance and security requirements.
•	 Cost optimization strategies: These play a crucial role in managing expenses and maximizing 
the value derived from compute and storage resources in cloud infrastructure. These strategies 
aim to optimize costs while still meeting the workload requirements effectively. By implementing 
cost optimization strategies, organizations can achieve significant savings and ensure efficient 
resource utilization. Here are some common cost optimization strategies:
•	 Rightsizing: Rightsizing involves matching the compute and storage resources to the actual 
workload requirements. It entails analyzing the resource utilization patterns and identifying over-
provisioned or under-utilized resources. By resizing or adjusting the allocated resources based 
on actual needs, organizations can eliminate unnecessary costs and optimize resource utilization.
•	 Reserved instances or savings plans: Cloud service providers often offer discounted pricing 
options for compute and storage resources through reserved instances or savings plans. These 
options allow organizations to commit to a specific usage level over a longer duration in exchange 
for lower rates. By utilizing reserved instances or savings plans effectively, organizations can 
achieve cost savings, especially for workloads with predictable or steady resource demands.
•	 Spot instances or preemptible VMs: Spot instances, also known as preemptible VMs in 
some cloud platforms, offer significant cost savings compared to on-demand instances. These 
instances are available at a lower price because they can be interrupted or reclaimed by the 
cloud provider when demand exceeds supply. Spot instances are ideal for fault-tolerant and 
flexible workloads that can handle interruptions or sudden termination.

Considerations and cost optimization strategies for compute and storage
103
•	 Auto-scaling and load balancing: Auto-scaling enables the dynamic adjustment of compute 
and storage resources based on workload demands. By automatically scaling resources up or 
down, organizations can align resource allocation with actual needs, eliminating unnecessary 
costs during periods of low demand. Load balancing distributes the workload across multiple 
resources to ensure efficient utilization and avoid resource bottlenecks.
•	 Data life cycle management: Analyzing data life cycle patterns and implementing appropriate 
storage tiers can optimize costs. Not all data requires high-performance storage, and by 
transitioning less frequently accessed or older data to lower-cost storage tiers such as object 
storage or archival storage, organizations can significantly reduce storage expenses while 
maintaining data accessibility.
•	 Resource tagging and monitoring: Implementing resource tagging and comprehensive 
monitoring allows organizations to gain insights into resource utilization, costs, and trends. By 
tracking resource usage and costs at a granular level, organizations can identify cost-intensive 
areas, optimize resource allocation, and make informed decisions for cost optimization.
•	 Cloud cost management tools: Utilizing cloud cost management tools and platforms provides 
visibility into resource usage, costs, and recommendations for cost optimization. These tools 
offer insights, cost allocation, budgeting capabilities, and recommendations to optimize resource 
usage and costs effectively.
Evaluating cloud provider offerings and SLAs is a critical step in selecting the right cloud provider for 
compute and storage services. It involves assessing various factors, including the provider’s capabilities, 
reliability, performance guarantees, and support. Here are some key aspects to consider when evaluating 
cloud provider offerings and SLAs:
•	 Service offerings: Begin by examining the range of compute and storage services offered by the 
cloud provider. Understand the specific offerings such as virtual machines, storage types (block, 
file, and object), databases, and other specialized services. Evaluate whether these offerings align 
with your organization’s requirements and can effectively support your workloads.
•	 Pricing and cost transparency: Examine the pricing models and cost structures of the cloud 
provider. Understand how compute and storage services are billed, including factors such as 
data transfer costs, storage costs, and any additional charges. Evaluate whether the provider 
offers transparent pricing and provides tools to monitor and manage costs effectively.
•	 SLAs: Carefully review the SLAs provided by the cloud provider for compute and storage services. 
SLAs define the provider’s commitments regarding service availability, performance, response 
times, and issue resolution. Pay attention to factors such as uptime guarantees, service credits in 
case of SLA violations, and the provider’s responsibilities during service disruptions or data loss.
•	 Support and customer service: Assess the provider’s support offerings and customer service 
capabilities. Determine the level of support provided, such as 24/7 availability, response times, 
and communication channels. Consider the provider’s reputation for customer service and their 
willingness to work closely with customers in resolving issues and providing technical assistance.

Storage
104
•	 Storage tiering and life cycle policies: These are essential aspects of managing data in cloud 
storage environments. They enable organizations to optimize storage costs, performance, and data 
accessibility by intelligently classifying and moving data across different storage tiers based on 
its value and usage patterns. Here’s a detailed discussion of storage tiering and life cycle policies:
•	 Storage tiering: Storage tiering involves categorizing data into different tiers based on its 
characteristics and access requirements. Typically, storage tiers are defined by their performance, 
capacity, and cost. Higher-tier storage provides faster access and lower latency but comes at a 
higher cost, while lower-tier storage offers larger capacity and lower cost but with slower access. 
By tiering data, organizations can align storage costs with the value of the data and ensure that 
frequently accessed or critical data resides in higher-performing storage tiers.
•	 Hot, warm, and cold data: A common approach to storage tiering is to classify data into hot, 
warm, and cold categories. Hot data refers to frequently accessed and time-critical data that 
requires the highest performance. Warm data represents data that is accessed less frequently 
but still requires relatively fast access. Cold data includes data that is rarely accessed but may 
need to be retained for compliance or archival purposes. Each category is associated with a 
corresponding storage tier, with hot data residing in the fastest storage and cold data residing 
in the most cost-effective storage.
•	 Life cycle policies: Life cycle policies define rules for automatically moving data between 
different storage tiers based on predefined criteria. These policies consider factors such as data 
age, access frequency, business relevance, and compliance requirements. For example, a policy 
may specify that data that hasn’t been accessed for a certain period should be automatically 
moved from a hot tier to a warm or cold tier. Life cycle policies streamline data management 
by automating the process of moving data to the appropriate storage tier based on its changing 
characteristics and access patterns.
Rightsizing compute and storage resources is a practice in cloud computing that involves optimizing 
the allocation of resources to match the actual needs of applications and workloads. It ensures that 
organizations are neither overprovisioning nor underprovisioning their compute and storage resources, 
leading to cost savings, improved performance, and better resource utilization. Let’s discuss this topic 
in detail:
•	 Understanding resource utilization: Rightsizing begins with a thorough analysis of resource 
utilization. It involves assessing the current usage patterns of compute and storage resources, 
including CPU, memory, disk space, and I/O operations. By examining historical data and 
monitoring the workload’s behavior, organizations can identify trends, peak usage periods, 
and resource bottlenecks.
•	 Identifying overprovisioning: Overprovisioning occurs when resources are allocated in excess 
of what is required. This can happen due to factors such as overestimating resource demands, 
deploying resources based on peak loads, or lack of visibility into application requirements. 
Overprovisioning leads to unnecessary costs and underutilization of resources.

Summary
105
•	 Addressing underprovisioning: Underprovisioning occurs when resources are insufficient 
to meet the demands of applications or workloads. This can result in degraded performance, 
application failures, and unhappy end users. Under-provisioning often happens when organizations 
are conservative in resource allocation or fail to anticipate sudden spikes in demand.
Rightsizing strategies:
•	 Performance monitoring and analysis: Implementing robust monitoring and performance 
analysis tools helps organizations gain visibility into resource usage and identify areas of 
overprovisioning or underprovisioning. By monitoring key performance metrics, such as CPU 
utilization, memory usage, and disk I/O, organizations can pinpoint resource bottlenecks and 
make informed decisions.
•	 Rightsizing compute resources: Rightsizing compute resources involves adjusting the allocated 
CPU and memory based on workload requirements. This can be achieved by analyzing historical 
usage patterns, identifying peak periods, and provisioning resources accordingly. Techniques 
such as vertical scaling (increasing or decreasing resource capacity within a single server) or 
horizontal scaling (adding or removing servers) can be employed to match resource needs.
•	 Rightsizing storage resources: For storage resources, rightsizing involves evaluating the 
amount of disk space, I/O performance, and data access patterns. It may involve resizing 
volumes, implementing data deduplication and compression techniques, or employing tiered 
storage solutions to match the storage requirements of different data types and access patterns.
•	 Automation and autoscaling: Leveraging automation and autoscaling capabilities provided by 
cloud service providers can help organizations dynamically adjust resource allocation based on 
real-time demand. Autoscaling allows resources to be automatically added or removed based 
on predefined thresholds, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.
By accurately matching resources to workload requirements, organizations can achieve cost optimization, 
improved performance, and efficient resource utilization. It requires continuous monitoring, analysis, 
and the ability to adapt resources.
By considering all these factors when selecting compute and storage resources in cloud infrastructure, 
organizations can make informed decisions that align with their workload needs, scalability requirements, 
availability expectations, cost optimization goals, and security and compliance standards. This thoughtful 
approach ensures the efficient utilization of resources, optimal performance, and cost-effectiveness 
in cloud deployments.

CDNs are strategic solutions for enhancing content delivery and user experience. CDNs leverage a 
distributed network of servers, strategically placed in various geographical locations, to cache and 
serve content from locations that are closer to the end users. This approach reduces the latency in 
content delivery and minimizes the load on the origin server, resulting in faster load times and a 
better overall user experience.
VPNs are integral to establishing secure communication channels between on-premises networks and 
cloud resources over the public internet. VPNs utilize encryption and authentication mechanisms to 
ensure data privacy and integrity during transmission, allowing organizations to securely access and 
manage cloud-based resources while maintaining a seamless and protected connection.
As cloud computing continues to evolve, networking remains at the forefront of innovation, enabling 
cutting-edge technologies such as edge computing and serverless computing. Edge computing leverages 
the distribution of computing resources closer to the end users or devices, reducing data latency 
and enabling real-time processing of data. Serverless computing abstracts the server management 
layer, allowing developers to focus solely on writing and deploying code, while the cloud provider 
automatically handles the underlying infrastructure.
In conclusion, networking is the lifeblood of cloud computing, interconnecting resources, users, 
and services to create a cohesive, scalable, and globally accessible cloud ecosystem. As organizations 
increasingly embrace cloud technology, a solid understanding of cloud networking becomes paramount 
to designing, implementing, and managing efficient and secure cloud solutions. This chapter aims

VPN
As we discussed previously, a VPN is a secure networking technology that allows users to establish 
encrypted communication channels over the internet or any untrusted network. VPNs create a private 
and encrypted “tunnel” between the user’s device (such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet) and a 
VPN server. This encrypted connection ensures that data transmitted between the user’s device and 
the VPN server remains confidential and secure.
VPNs serve two primary purposes:
•	 Data privacy: VPNs encrypt the data transmitted over the internet, making it unreadable to 
anyone who might intercept it. This ensures that sensitive information, such as passwords, 
financial details, or business data, remains private and protected from potential eavesdroppers.
•	 Anonymity and bypassing restrictions: VPNs can also mask the user’s IP address, effectively 
hiding their identity and location. This feature allows users to bypass geographic restrictions 
and access content or services that may be restricted or blocked in their region.
VPNs are widely used for various purposes, such as secure remote access to corporate networks, 
safeguarding online privacy, accessing geographically restricted content, and enhancing security 
while using public Wi-Fi networks.
Let’s see how we can configure a VPN in an AWS environment.
Configuring a VPN in an AWS environment involves several steps. Here is a high-level overview of 
the process:
1.	
Create a virtual private gateway (VGW): Start by creating a VGW in the AWS Management 
Console. The VGW serves as the entry and exit point for VPN traffic to and from your VPC.
2.	
Set up a customer gateway (CGW): Next, set up a CGW on your on-premises network. The 
CGW represents the device or software that acts as the VPN endpoint on your side.
3.	
Create a site-to-site VPN connection: Create a site-to-site VPN connection in the AWS 
Management Console. This connection establishes the secure communication tunnel between 
the VGW in AWS and the CGW on your on-premises network.

Networking
118
4.	
Configure VPN connection details: For the site-to-site VPN connection configuration, specify 
the following details:
	 VGW ID
	 CGW IP address
	 A pre-shared key (PSK) for authentication
5.	
Download configuration information: After creating the VPN connection, download the 
configuration details for your CGW. This includes the configuration file and the pre-shared key.
6.	
Configure your CGW: On your on-premises network, use the downloaded configuration 
information to configure your CGW device or software. This step may vary depending on the 
CGW solution you are using.
7.	
Enable route propagation (optional): If you want your AWS VPC to communicate with your 
on-premises network, enable route propagation from the VPN connection to the route tables 
in your VPC.
8.	
Verify and monitor the VPN connection: Once the VPN has been configured, verify the 
status of the VPN connection in the AWS Management Console. You can also monitor VPN 
performance and connection status using Amazon CloudWatch.
With these steps completed, you will have successfully configured a VPN connection between your AWS 
VPC and your on-premises network. This allows secure communication between the two environments, 
enabling data exchange and resource access as if they were part of the same private network.
Let’s understand how we can accomplish the same using Cloud Shell.

describe-vpn-connections command to get information about the VPN connection 
you just created. Note down the configuration details, including the pre-shared key and the 
configuration file, as you will need them to configure your CGW:
aws ec2 describe-vpn-connections --filters 
"Name=tag:Name,Values=my-vpn-connection"
8.	
Configure your CGW: On your on-premises network, use the downloaded configuration 
information (pre-shared key and configuration file) to configure your CGW device or software.
9.	
Verify and monitor the VPN connection: Once the VPN has been configured, verify the status 
of the VPN connection in the AWS Management Console or using the aws ec2 describe-
vpn-connections command. You can also monitor VPN performance and connection 
status using Amazon CloudWatch.
With these steps, you have successfully configured a VPN connection between your AWS VPC and 
your on-premises network using Cloud Shell. This enables secure communication and data exchange 
between the two environments as if they were part of the same private network.

Subnetting and IP addressing
Subnetting and IP addressing are fundamental concepts in computer networking that play a crucial role 
in the design and management of cloud computing environments. In cloud computing, virtualization 
and abstraction technologies allow for flexible allocation and utilization of resources. Subnetting and 
IP addressing are essential for effectively organizing and managing these resources within a cloud 
infrastructure. This section explores the concepts of subnetting and IP addressing in the context of 
cloud computing, discussing their importance, benefits, and best practices for their implementation.
Understanding subnetting in cloud computing
Subnetting involves dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable segments called subnets. 
In the context of cloud computing, subnets are virtual network partitions that allow for logical isolation 
and efficient resource utilization. By creating subnets, cloud service providers and organizations can 
organize their cloud resources into distinct groups with their IP address ranges, routing tables, and 
security settings. This enables better network management, security, and scalability in cloud environments.
The following are the benefits of subnetting in cloud computing:
•	 Network isolation: Subnetting allows different sets of resources to be isolated from each other, 
preventing unauthorized access and minimizing the impact of security breaches or network 
issues on other subnets
•	  Improved performance: Subnetting can improve network performance by reducing broadcast 
traffic and allowing for more efficient use of network resources
•	 Segregation of services: Subnets facilitate the segregation of services based on their functional 
requirements, enabling easier management and troubleshooting
IP addressing in cloud computing
IP addressing involves assigning unique IP addresses to devices and resources connected to a network. 
In cloud computing, IP addressing plays a critical role in identifying and locating cloud resources and 
enabling communication between them.
The following types of IP addressing are available in cloud computing:
•	 Public IP addressing: Public IP addresses are routable over the internet and are used to expose 
resources to the public or connect cloud instances directly to the internet.

Networking
122
•	 Private IP addressing: Private IP addresses are non-routable over the internet and are used 
for internal communication within a cloud environment. Private IP addresses are commonly 
used for resources that do not need to be directly accessed from the internet.
•	 Elastic IP addressing: Elastic IP addresses are static public IP addresses that can be dynamically 
assigned to cloud resources. They allow for the reassignment of IP addresses between instances, 
enhancing availability and seamless service migration.
Let’s look at the best practices for IP addressing in cloud computing:
•	 Use private IP addressing: Whenever possible, use private IP addressing for cloud resources 
to enhance security and reduce exposure to external threats
•	 Implement network address translation (NAT): NAT enables instances in private subnets to 
access the internet through a public IP address assigned to a NAT gateway, providing internet 
connectivity without exposing private IP addresses directly
•	 Leverage IP address management (IPAM) tools: IPAM tools help in managing IP address 
allocation, tracking, and resource discovery, streamlining IP address management in complex 
cloud environments
IPv4 and IPv6 considerations in cloud computing
With the depletion of IPv4 addresses, IPv6 adoption has become essential in cloud computing. IPv6 
provides a vast address space, ensuring the continued growth and scalability of cloud infrastructures.
Let’s look at the benefits of IPv6 in cloud computing:
•	 Larger address space: IPv6 provides a virtually unlimited address space, accommodating the 
proliferation of connected devices and resources in the cloud
•	 Simplified addressing: IPv6 uses a simplified and more efficient addressing format, making 
it easier to manage and configure IP addresses in cloud environments
•	 Enhanced security: IPv6 includes built-in security features, such as IPsec, which can improve 
the security of data transmitted over the network
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) in cloud computing
DHCP is a network protocol that’s used to dynamically assign IP addresses and other network 
configuration parameters to devices in a network. In cloud computing, DHCP can be used to automate 
the allocation of IP addresses to instances and other cloud resources.
Let’s look at the benefits of DHCP in cloud computing:
•	 Simplified IP address management: DHCP automates the IP address assignment process, 
reducing the need for manual configuration and minimizing human errors

Exploring network options in cloud computing
123
•	 Scalability: DHCP enables efficient IP address allocation in large-scale cloud environments, 
accommodating dynamic resource provisioning and deallocation
•	 Resource optimization: With DHCP, IP addresses are only assigned when needed, allowing 
for better resource utilization and avoiding IP address wastage
Let’s see an example of setting up an IPV4 configuration in the AWS cloud.

Load balancing
This part is a section in itself and could be titled Load balancing in cloud computing – optimizing 
performance and availability.
Load balancing is a critical component of modern cloud computing architectures that aims to distribute 
network traffic evenly across multiple servers or resources. As cloud computing environments continue 
to grow in scale and complexity, load balancing becomes essential to ensure optimal performance, 
scalability, and high availability of cloud applications and services. This section explores the concept 

Networking

of load balancing in cloud computing, its benefits, various load balancing techniques, and the role it 
plays in enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of cloud-based systems.
Load balancing is the process of efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across multiple 
resources, such as VMs, containers, or application instances, to avoid overloading any single resource. 
The goal is to ensure that each resource handles an equitable share of the traffic, preventing bottlenecks 
and ensuring that the cloud infrastructure operates efficiently and effectively.
Let’s consider the benefits of load balancing in cloud computing:
•	 Scalability: Load balancing enables cloud services to scale horizontally by adding or removing 
resources based on demand, effectively handling increased or decreased traffic loads.
•	 High availability: By distributing traffic across multiple resources, load balancing improves 
system availability. If one resource fails or becomes unavailable, the load balancer redirects 
traffic to healthy resources, minimizing downtime and service disruption.
•	 Performance optimization: Load balancing ensures that each resource operates within its capacity, 
reducing response times and improving the overall performance of cloud-based applications.
Various load balancing techniques are employed in cloud computing to efficiently manage network 
traffic. Some of the commonly used load balancing algorithms are as follows:
•	 Round robin: In this technique, traffic is evenly sequentially distributed to each resource. Each 
incoming request is directed to the next resource in the list, ensuring a fair distribution of traffic.
•	 Least connections: In this approach, incoming requests are routed to the resource with the 
fewest active connections. It helps prevent heavily loaded resources from becoming overloaded.
•	 Weighted round robin: This technique assigns a weight to each resource based on its capacity or 
performance. Resources with higher weights receive a proportionally larger share of the traffic.
•	 Least response time: Load balancers direct requests to the resource that has the lowest response 
time. It helps in minimizing latency and optimizing user experience.
Load balancing is integrated into various cloud services to enhance their functionality and performance:
•	 Application Load Balancer (ALB): AWS ALB is a cloud service that distributes incoming 
application traffic across multiple targets (such as EC2 instances) within a region based on 
routing rules and content-based routing
•	 Network Load Balancer (NLB): AWS NLB provides ultra-low latency and high throughput for 
handling TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic, making it ideal for applications that require high performance
•	 Load balancers for GCP: GCP offers various load balancing services, including HTTP(S) Load 
Balancing, SSL Proxy Load Balancing, and TCP Proxy Load Balancing, catering to different 
application requirements

Exploring network options in cloud computing
127
Load balancing works hand-in-hand with auto-scaling in cloud environments. Auto-scaling automatically 
adjusts the number of resources based on traffic demand, while load balancing efficiently distributes 
that traffic among the resources:
•	 Dynamic resource provisioning: Load balancers work in tandem with auto-scaling groups, 
adding or removing resources as needed to accommodate varying workloads
•	 Elasticity: Auto-scaling and load balancing together enable elasticity, allowing cloud infrastructures 
to flexibly expand or contract based on demand, optimizing resource utilization
Load balancing is a fundamental aspect of cloud computing that ensures optimal performance, scalability, 
and high availability of cloud-based applications and services. By evenly distributing incoming network 
traffic across multiple resources, load balancers prevent overload and improve the overall efficiency 
of cloud infrastructures. Figure 5.4 depicts the functioning of a couple of load balancers in a cloud 
environment. The highlighted section in green shows the placement of a load balancer:
Figure 5.3 – A load balancer in a cloud environment (Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) in the case of AWS)
Various load balancing techniques and specialized load balancing services provided by cloud providers 
enhance the flexibility and responsiveness of cloud-based systems. As cloud computing continues to 
evolve, load balancing will remain a critical element in designing robust, scalable, and reliable cloud 
architectures, effectively meeting the demands of modern, data-driven applications.

geographic locations. These servers are strategically positioned in data centers and connected 
to the internet’s backbone, ensuring close proximity to end users.
•	 Content caching: CDNs cache frequently accessed content, such as images, CSS files, and videos, 
on edge servers. When a user requests this content, the CDN delivers it from the nearest edge 
server, reducing latency and network congestion.
•	 Content routing: CDNs employ intelligent routing algorithms to direct user requests to the 
most appropriate edge server based on factors such as geographical proximity, server load, 
and network conditions.
•	 Load balancing: CDNs use load balancing techniques to evenly distribute traffic across multiple 
edge servers, preventing overloading on any individual server and optimizing resource utilization.
•	 Dynamic content delivery: In addition to static content, modern CDNs support dynamic 
content delivery by integrating with the website’s application servers. This allows them to cache 
and deliver personalized and frequently changing content efficiently.

Data breaches in cloud environments are a significant concern for organizations and individuals alike. 
A data breach occurs when unauthorized individuals or entities gain access to sensitive or confidential 
information, resulting in the exposure, theft, or misuse of that data. Cloud computing, with its shared 
infrastructure and multi-tenant nature, introduces unique challenges that can potentially increase 
the risk of data breaches:
•	 Causes and vulnerabilities: Several factors contribute to data breaches in cloud environments. 
Misconfigurations in cloud services, weak access controls, and improper handling of data can 
expose critical information to unauthorized users. Inadequate encryption and data protection 
practices can also leave data vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access. Additionally, 
vulnerabilities in cloud service APIs or shared technology components might be exploited by 
attackers to gain access to sensitive data.
•	 Impact and consequences: The consequences of a data breach can be severe. For individuals, 
it can result in identity theft, financial loss, and reputational damage. For organizations, a data 
breach can lead to financial losses, regulatory penalties, and loss of customer trust. In some 
cases, the damage caused by a data breach can be irreparable and lead to the downfall of the 
affected business.
Insider threats
While cloud providers implement stringent security measures, internal employees or authorized users 
may pose significant threats to data security. We will discuss the importance of privileged access 
management (PAM), monitoring user activities, and implementing measures to mitigate the risk of 
insider threats.
Insider threats pose a significant risk in cloud environments. Malicious or negligent actions by 
employees or authorized users with access to sensitive data can lead to data breaches. Organizations must 
implement strong access controls and monitoring mechanisms to detect and prevent insider threats.
An insider threat is defined as a security risk that originates from individuals within an organization, 
including employees, contractors, or business partners, who have legitimate access to the organization’s 
systems, data, or facilities. These insiders may intentionally or unintentionally misuse their access 
privileges to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of sensitive information or 
critical assets.
Types of insider threats
 Insider threats can be classified into three primary categories:
•	 Malicious insiders: These individuals intentionally and actively seek to harm the organization. 
Their motives may vary, such as revenge, financial gain, or espionage. They might steal sensitive 
data, disrupt operations, or introduce malware into the system.

Understanding cloud security risks
145
•	 Negligent insiders: Negligent insiders are not malicious but inadvertently cause security 
incidents. They may fall victim to phishing attacks, mishandle data, or accidentally expose 
sensitive information, leading to data breaches.
•	 Compromised insiders: In this scenario, attackers gain unauthorized access to an insider’s 
credentials or devices, using them as a front to carry out malicious activities within the organization.
Common insider threat scenarios
 Insider threats can manifest in various ways, as follows:
•	 Data theft: Malicious insiders with access to valuable intellectual property or sensitive customer 
data may steal and leak it to competitors or on the dark web
•	 Sabotage: Disgruntled employees might deliberately disrupt operations, delete critical files, or 
introduce malware to cause damage
•	 Unauthorized disclosure: Insiders may inadvertently or intentionally share confidential 
information with unauthorized parties, leading to reputational and legal consequences
•	 Insider fraud: Employees with access to financial systems might engage in fraudulent activities, 
such as altering financial records or siphoning funds
Motives behind insider threats
Insider threats often stem from a combination of factors:
•	 Financial gain: Disgruntled employees seeking personal financial benefits may engage in 
fraud or theft
•	 Revenge: Former employees or individuals with a grudge against the organization may seek 
revenge through malicious actions
•	 Whistleblowing: Employees with grievances may leak sensitive information to expose 
wrongdoing within the organization
•	 Carelessness: Negligent employees may unknowingly expose sensitive data due to poor 
security practices
Detection and prevention strategies
Detecting insider threats requires a multi-layered approach that includes the following:
•	 User behavior analytics: Monitoring user activities and behavior to identify deviations from 
normal patterns and flag suspicious actions
•	 Data loss prevention (DLP): Implementing DLP solutions to prevent the unauthorized 
transmission of sensitive data outside the organization

Security and Compliance 1 – Cloud Perspective
146
•	 PAM: Restricting access to critical systems and data, ensuring only authorized users have 
privileged access

activities to detect anomalous behavior
Cultural and organizational aspects
Creating a positive and supportive work environment can mitigate insider threats. Encouraging open 
communication, providing employee assistance programs, and addressing grievances promptly can 
reduce the likelihood of malicious intent.
Data loss and recovery
Cloud service disruptions or hardware failures can lead to data loss if not adequately addressed. In 
this section, we will examine the risks associated with data loss, including accidental deletions, and 
explore data recovery and backup strategies to ensure business continuity.
Data loss and recovery are critical concerns in cloud computing, where vast amounts of sensitive 
information is stored and processed. Data loss can occur due to various factors, such as hardware 
failures, accidental deletions, cyberattacks, or natural disasters. In such scenarios, the ability to recover 
lost data efficiently is essential for ensuring business continuity and maintaining data integrity. Let’s 
delve into the details of data loss and recovery in cloud environments:
•	 Causes of data loss: Data loss can result from both human errors and technical failures. Accidental 
deletions or overwrites, often caused by user mistakes, account for a significant portion of data 
loss incidents. Hardware failures, including disk crashes or server malfunctions, can lead to 
data loss at the infrastructure level. Cyberattacks, such as ransomware or destructive malware, 
can also encrypt or delete data, making recovery challenging.
•	 Importance of data recovery: The ability to recover lost data promptly is crucial for organizations 
to continue their operations without disruptions. Lost data may include critical business 
information, customer records, financial data, or proprietary intellectual property. A robust data 
recovery strategy helps organizations mitigate the potential financial losses, legal consequences, 
and reputational damage associated with data loss incidents.
•	 Backup strategies: Regular data backups are fundamental to data recovery in cloud environments. 
Organizations should implement backup strategies that include periodic backups of critical data 
to separate storage systems, either on-premises or in a different cloud region. Cloud providers 
often offer backup services or APIs to facilitate automated and scheduled backups.

Understanding cloud security risks
147
•	 Point-in-time snapshots: Point-in-time snapshots are a useful feature provided by many cloud 
platforms, allowing organizations to create snapshots of their data at specific points in time. 
These snapshots serve as recovery points, enabling organizations to restore data to a previous 
state in case of data loss.
•	 Replication and redundancy: Cloud providers often offer data replication and redundancy 
options. Data replication ensures that data is stored in multiple locations, reducing the risk of 
complete data loss. Redundant storage systems and failover mechanisms help maintain data 
availability even in the event of hardware failures.
•	 Recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO): Organizations must 
define their RTO and RPO to set recovery goals. RTO specifies the maximum acceptable 
downtime before data recovery, while RPO defines the maximum data loss that can be tolerated 
during recovery.
•	 Testing data recovery: Periodic testing of data recovery processes is crucial to ensure the 
effectiveness of backup and recovery strategies. Organizations should perform recovery drills 
and simulations to verify the integrity and reliability of their backups and ensure they can 
restore data successfully.
•	 Cloud disaster recovery services: Some cloud providers offer disaster recovery services that 
automate data recovery processes, enabling organizations to restore data quickly and efficiently 
in the event of a catastrophic failure or disaster.
•	 Hybrid and multi-cloud recovery: Organizations with hybrid or multi-cloud environments 
must ensure their data recovery strategies span across all cloud environments and on-premises 
systems. Consistent recovery procedures and centralized management are essential for 
comprehensive data recovery.
•	 Security and compliance considerations: Data recovery processes should be aligned with 
security and compliance requirements. Encryption of backup data and secure access controls 
helps protect sensitive information during recovery.
Insecure APIs
APIs enable seamless communication between different cloud services. However, insecure APIs can be 
exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to cloud resources. We will explore the significance 
of secure API practices and how they contribute to a more secure cloud environment.
Insecure APIs pose a significant security risk in cloud computing environments. APIs serve as bridges 
that enable different software applications and services to communicate and exchange data seamlessly. 
However, when APIs are not adequately secured, they can become vulnerable points of entry for 
attackers to exploit, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and other security 
incidents. Understanding the risks associated with insecure APIs is essential for ensuring the security 
and integrity of cloud-based systems, as we will see in the following sections.

Security and Compliance 1 – Cloud Perspective
148
API security risks
Several factors contribute to API security risks in cloud environments:
•	 Weak authentication and authorization: APIs with inadequate authentication mechanisms 
might allow unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources
•	 Lack of input validation: Failure to validate input data can lead to injection attacks, such as 
SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS), compromising the security of the application
•	 Inadequate encryption: Transmitting sensitive data over APIs without encryption can expose 
information to eavesdropping and data interception
•	 Excessive permissions: APIs with overly permissive access controls can grant attackers access 
to more data and functionality than necessary
•	 Insecure error handling: Revealing detailed error messages in API responses can provide 
attackers with valuable insights to exploit vulnerabilities
•	 API rate limiting: Failure to implement rate limiting can make APIs vulnerable to DoS attacks, 
where attackers overload the system with excessive requests
Securing API endpoints
To enhance API security, several best practices should be followed:
•	 Strong authentication and authorization: Implementing robust authentication methods, such 
as OAuth or API keys, ensures that only authorized users can access APIs
•	 Input validation and sanitization: Validating and sanitizing all input data prevents injection 
attacks and ensures that data transmitted via APIs is safe
•	 Encryption: Encrypting API communications using HTTPS (TLS/SSL) prevents data interception 
and ensures data privacy during transmission
•	 Least privilege principle: APIs should follow the principle of least privilege, granting users 
only the necessary permissions to access specific resources
•	 Secure error handling: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages and implement 
proper logging to monitor API activities
•	 API rate limiting and throttling: Implementing rate limiting and throttling mechanisms can 
help prevent DoS attacks by limiting the number of requests per user or IP address
API security testing and auditing
Regular security testing and auditing of APIs is critical to identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring 
ongoing security. Techniques such as penetration testing, code reviews, and vulnerability assessments 
help uncover weaknesses in APIs that require remediation.

Understanding cloud security risks
149
API gateways and API management platforms
Organizations can use API gateways and API management platforms to provide an additional layer 
of security for APIs. These platforms can handle authentication, rate limiting, encryption, and other 
security features centrally, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities in individual APIs.
API versioning and life cycle management
Proper API versioning and life cycle management help maintain security by ensuring that deprecated 
or insecure API versions are retired and no longer accessible.
API security education and awareness
Ensuring that developers and API consumers are educated about API security best practices and 
potential risks fosters a security-first mindset and contributes to better overall API security.
Securing APIs is of paramount importance in cloud environments to protect against potential data 
breaches and security incidents. By implementing robust security measures, such as strong authentication, 
input validation, encryption, and proper error handling, organizations can enhance the security of their 
APIs. Regular security testing, API gateways, and proper life cycle management contribute to ongoing 
API security and help maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data exchanged through APIs. A 
comprehensive approach to API security is crucial for building trust with users and safeguarding 
cloud-based systems from external threats.
DoS attacks
Cloud services can become targets of DoS attacks, which aim to overwhelm resources and disrupt 
service availability. Understanding DoS attack risks will lead us to explore strategies for the detection, 
mitigation, and prevention of such attacks.
DoS attacks are malicious attempts to disrupt the normal operation of an online service, network, 
or cloud environment by overwhelming it with a massive volume of traffic or resource requests. The 
primary objective of a DoS attack is to render the target inaccessible to legitimate users, causing service 
downtime and disruption. These attacks can have severe consequences for businesses and organizations, 
leading to financial losses, damage to reputation, and loss of customer trust. Understanding the 
intricacies of DoS attacks is essential for implementing effective mitigation strategies and ensuring 
the resilience of cloud-based systems.
Types of DoS attacks
There are different types of DoS attacks:
•	 Volume-based attacks: These attacks flood the target with a high volume of traffic, consuming 
network bandwidth and overwhelming server resources

Security and Compliance 1 – Cloud Perspective
150
•	 Protocol-based attacks: These attacks exploit weaknesses in network protocols to consume 
server resources, leading to service degradation or unresponsiveness
•	 Application layer attacks: Also known as Layer 7 attacks, these target specific applications or 
services, such as web servers, by exploiting vulnerabilities and causing them to become unresponsive
•	 Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks: DDoS attacks involve multiple sources to 
coordinate and launch the attack simultaneously, making it more challenging to mitigate
The impact of DoS attacks
DoS attacks can have severe consequences:
•	 Service disruption: The primary goal of a DoS attack is to disrupt the target service, making 
it inaccessible to legitimate users
•	 Financial losses: Downtime resulting from DoS attacks can lead to financial losses for businesses, 
particularly those that rely on continuous online operations
•	 Reputational damage: Extended service disruptions can tarnish an organization’s reputation, 
leading to loss of customer trust and loyalty
•	 Opportunities for other attacks: A successful DoS attack may serve as a distraction, providing 
an opportunity for other, more damaging cyberattacks
DDoS attacks and cloud environments
Cloud-based services are attractive targets for DDoS attacks due to their scalability and the potential 
to impact multiple customers hosted on the same infrastructure. DDoS attacks can be challenging 
to detect and mitigate in a cloud environment, as the traffic from multiple sources can be distributed 
and masked effectively.
DoS attack mitigation strategies
Let’s look at some examples:
•	 Traffic filtering: Implementing traffic filtering mechanisms can help block malicious traffic 
and allow only legitimate traffic to reach the target
•	 Rate limiting: Rate limiting restricts the number of requests from a single IP address, preventing 
an attacker from overwhelming the system with excessive requests
•	 Load balancing: Distributing traffic across multiple servers can help distribute the load and 
prevent one server from becoming overwhelmed
•	 Web Application Firewalls (WAFs): WAFs can identify and block malicious traffic targeting 
specific applications, helping protect against Layer 7 attacks
•	 Anomaly detection: Employing anomaly detection systems can help with identifying unusual 
traffic patterns and trigger proactive responses

AWS CloudFront:
Figure 6.1 – WAF layout in AWS CloudFront
The preceding figure shows how the API calls interact with the AWS WAF service. Once they’ve gone 
through the WAF service, the API calls can interact with other AWS services. Please take note of the 
flow of the connection from the internet gateway to the application load balancer and then to other 
AWS services such as the EC2 instance.
Cloud-based DDoS protection services
Many cloud service providers offer DDoS protection services that leverage their distributed infrastructure 
to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks in real time. These services can effectively handle large-scale 
DDoS attacks and ensure minimal service disruption for customers.
Incident response and preparedness
Organizations must have a comprehensive incident response plan in place to detect and respond to 
DoS attacks promptly. Preparing for potential DoS attacks and conducting regular drills can improve 
the organization’s ability to respond effectively.
DoS attacks are a serious threat to the availability and stability of cloud-based services. Understanding 
the different types of DoS attacks and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies is crucial for 
organizations to protect their cloud environments from disruption. Cloud-based DDoS protection 
services and proactive incident response planning are essential elements of a robust defense against DoS 
attacks. By investing in proper defenses and staying vigilant, organizations can ensure the resilience 
of their cloud-based systems and maintain uninterrupted service availability for their users.

Shared technology vulnerabilities
In a multi-tenant cloud environment, shared technology components may introduce vulnerabilities 
that can be exploited by attackers. In this section, we will examine the risks associated with the “noisy 
neighbor” effect and explore measures to ensure isolation and segregation between tenants.
Shared technology vulnerabilities refer to security weaknesses that arise in cloud computing environments 
due to the shared nature of underlying infrastructure and resources among multiple tenants (users 
or organizations). In a multi-tenant cloud environment, various users or organizations coexist on the 
same physical hardware and virtualized resources. While cloud providers implement strict isolation 
mechanisms to separate tenants logically, vulnerabilities in shared technology components can 
potentially lead to breaches of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Understanding shared 
technology vulnerabilities is essential for cloud users to assess and manage risks effectively:
•	 The noisy neighbor effect: The primary concern with shared technology vulnerabilities is the 
“noisy neighbor” effect. If one tenant consumes an excessive amount of resources or introduces 
malicious activities, it can impact the performance and availability of other neighboring tenants on 
the same infrastructure. For example, a resource-intensive application from one tenant might lead 
to degraded performance for others, affecting their ability to access and utilize resources effectively.
•	 Virtualization vulnerabilities: Virtualization, a core technology that enables multi-tenancy in 
the cloud, can introduce vulnerabilities. Flaws in the hypervisor or VM escape vulnerabilities 
could allow an attacker from one VM to access or compromise other VMs on the same physical 
host, potentially leading to data breaches and unauthorized access.
•	 Insecure APIs and management interfaces: Cloud providers offer APIs and management 
interfaces to facilitate interaction and control of cloud resources. If these interfaces are not 
adequately secured, attackers might exploit them to gain unauthorized access to tenant data 
or control cloud resources.
•	 Cross-tenant data leakage: In a shared infrastructure, improper data isolation or misconfigurations 
can lead to data leakage between tenants. A misconfigured storage bucket or database might 
expose one tenant’s sensitive data to other tenants or the public, leading to compliance violations 
and privacy breaches.
•	 Patching and software vulnerabilities: Shared technology components, such as operating systems 
and software libraries, need regular updates and patches to address security vulnerabilities. 
Failure to promptly apply patches can expose tenants to known vulnerabilities, which attackers 
can exploit to gain unauthorized access.
•	 Network vulnerabilities: Inadequate network segmentation or security controls can lead to 
network-based attacks, where an attacker on one tenant’s network attempts to infiltrate other 
tenants’ resources or intercept their data.
•	 Resource exhaustion: If one tenant launches a DDoS attack or uses excessive resources, it can 
cause resource exhaustion for other tenants, resulting in service unavailability.

solutions to control and monitor traffic entering and exiting cloud environments, preventing 
unauthorized access and cyber threats
•	 IDS/IPS: We will explore IDS and IPS tools that can detect and respond to potential security 
breaches and malicious activities in real time, enhancing cloud security
We will discuss these topics in detail now.
IAM
IAM is a crucial component of cloud security that focuses on managing user identities and controlling 
their access to resources within a cloud computing environment. IAM solutions are designed to ensure 
that only authorized individuals can access specific data, applications, or services, thereby enhancing 
data confidentiality, integrity, and overall cloud security. Let’s delve into the details of IAM and some 
of the tools and services associated with it.
Let’s look at some IAM components and features:
•	 Identity management: IAM solutions provide mechanisms to manage user identities, enabling 
administrators to create, modify, and delete user accounts. Each user is assigned a unique 
identity, and IAM systems maintain user attributes, roles, and permissions.
•	 Authentication: IAM ensures that users’ identities are verified before granting access to resources. 
Common authentication methods include username and password, multi-factor authentication 
(MFA), and integration with external identity providers (for example, SAML and OAuth).
•	 Authorization and access control: IAM allows fine-grained control over users’ access privileges. 
Administrators can assign roles or permissions to users, determining what actions they are 
allowed to perform on specific resources.
•	 Single sign-on (SSO): IAM often supports SSO, allowing users to access multiple cloud services 
with a single set of credentials. This enhances user convenience and reduces the risk of weak 
passwords or credentials reuse.
•	 PAM: IAM solutions offer PAM features to manage and monitor access to critical resources 
by privileged users. PAM ensures that privileged accounts are only used when necessary and 
with appropriate oversight.

155
IAM services
•	 Amazon Web Services (AWS) IAM: AWS IAM is a comprehensive IAM service for managing 
access to AWS resources. It enables users to create and manage AWS users, groups, and 
permissions, ensuring secure access to AWS services.
Setting up AWS IAM involves several key steps as you must create and manage user identities, access 
policies, and permissions within the AWS environment. IAM allows you to control who can access your 
AWS resources and what actions they can perform. Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting up AWS IAM:
1.	
Access the AWS Management Console: Sign in to your AWS account using your root credentials 
(the initial account you created during the AWS registration process) and access the AWS 
Management Console.
2.	
Create IAM users: In the IAM dashboard, click on Users in the left navigation panel, and then 
click Add user. Enter a username and select an access type:
	 Programmatic access: For users that require API access.
	 AWS Management Console access: For users that require access to the AWS 
Management Console.
3.	
Set user permissions: Assign permissions to the user. You can either attach existing policies 
(predefined permission sets) or create custom policies. The best practice is to follow the principle 
of least privilege, granting users only the permissions they require for their specific tasks.
4.	
Configure a user password and MFA: For users with AWS Management Console access, set 
up a password or require them to set one during their first login. Additionally, enable MFA 
for an extra layer of security.
5.	
Review and create a user: Review the user’s details and permissions, and then click Create 
user to complete the process. Users will receive an email with login details if they have AWS 
Management Console access.
6.	
Create IAM groups (optional): To manage permissions more efficiently, you can create 
IAM groups and assign policies to groups rather than individual users. This simplifies access 
management, especially for users with similar roles.
7.	
Attach users to groups (optional): Once IAM groups have been created, add users to the 
appropriate groups to grant them the required permissions.
8.	
Enable and configure IAM roles (optional): IAM roles are used to delegate permissions to 
AWS services and external entities. If you need to grant permissions to services or applications, 
create and configure IAM roles accordingly.
9.	
Manage IAM policies: Regularly review and update IAM policies as your organization’s 
requirements change. Ensure that users have the necessary permissions and that there are no 
unnecessary or overly permissive policies.

Security and Compliance 1 – Cloud Perspective
156
10.	 Monitoring and auditing: Enable AWS CloudTrail to log API activity and changes to IAM 
resources, providing an audit trail for security and compliance purposes. Additionally, set up 
AWS IAM Access Analyzer to review public and cross-account access to your resources.
Setting up AWS IAM using the AWS Command-Line Interface (CLI) involves using various AWS 
CLI commands to create users, groups, policies, and roles. Here are the steps to set up AWS IAM 
using the CLI:
1.	
Install and configure the AWS CLI: Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed on your local 
machine and configure it with your AWS credentials using the aws configure command.
2.	
Create an IAM user: Use the create-user command to create an IAM user. Replace 
<USERNAME> with the desired username:
aws iam create-user --user-name <USERNAME>
3.	
Create an IAM access key (for programmatic access): If the user requires programmatic 
access (access through API calls), create an access key using the create-access-key 
command. This will generate an access key ID and secret access key that the user will use to 
authenticate API requests:
aws iam create-access-key --user-name <USERNAME>
4.	
Create an IAM login profile (for AWS Management Console access): If the user requires 
access to the AWS Management Console, create a login profile using the create-login-
profile command. This will allow the user to sign in to the AWS Management Console 
with a username and password:
aws iam create-login-profile --user-name <USERNAME> --password 
<PASSWORD> --password-reset-required
5.	
Attach IAM policies: Attach an existing IAM policy to the user or create a custom policy and 
attach it. To attach an existing policy, use the attach-user-policy command, replacing 
<POLICY-ARN> with the ARN of the policy to attach:
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <USERNAME> --policy-arn

non-relational database models, businesses and developers can select the most appropriate solution 
for their specific data management and application needs.
Databases beyond the traditional realm
In a landscape where data has become increasingly diverse and complex, this topic explores innovative 
solutions that have emerged to accommodate various data structures, relationships, and use cases. 
From NoSQL databases such as document stores and graph databases to specialized models such 
as in-memory databases, time-series databases, and more, this topic illuminates the versatility and 
flexibility offered by these modern database types. By embracing these alternatives, businesses can 
harness the power of data in new and dynamic ways, adapting their data management strategies to 
the evolving requirements of today’s digital landscape.
There are various types of databases beyond the traditional relational model. Here are some examples 
of different database types, along with a brief description and an example for each.
Document database
Document databases store, retrieve, and manage data in a flexible, semi-structured format using 
documents (for example, JSON or BSON) instead of tables and rows.
Unlike the rigid structure of relational databases, document databases allow each document to 
have its own unique schema, accommodating dynamic and evolving data models. This flexibility is 
especially useful in scenarios where data structures can change frequently or where data is unstructured 
or semi-structured.
JSON functionality
JSON is a widely used format for structuring data. In the context of document databases, JSON 
provides a way to represent and store data in a hierarchical format, making it easy to store and retrieve 
complex data structures.
Key features of JSON in document databases include the following:
•	 Hierarchical data: JSON allows the nesting of data, creating a hierarchy of attributes and 
values within a single document. This makes it suitable for representing nested and complex 
data structures.
•	 Flexibility: JSON documents can have varying fields and structures, enabling easy adaptation 
to changing data requirements without altering the overall database schema.

•	 Requirements gathering: They serve as a foundation for gathering and validating business 
requirements before moving into the technical implementation phase

Database Services – Part 2
234
•	 Communication: Conceptual data models facilitate effective communication between business 
analysts, developers, and other stakeholders by providing a common reference point
•	 Design alignment: A well-constructed conceptual data model ensures that the eventual database 
schema aligns closely with the organization’s needs
The following is needed to create a conceptual data model:
•	 Requirements gathering: Engage with stakeholders to identify the major entities, attributes, 
and relationships relevant to the business.
•	 Entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs): ERDs visually represent entities, attributes, relationships, 
and their cardinalities. This graphical tool is commonly used to create conceptual data models.
•	 Simplified complexity: Focus on the key concepts and relationships while avoiding technical 
implementation details.
•	 Validation: Review the conceptual data model with stakeholders to ensure that it accurately 
captures the business’s understanding and requirements.
Example:
Consider an e-commerce platform. The conceptual data model might feature entities such as Customer, 
Product, and Order. The Customer entity could have attributes such as Name, Email, and Address. 
Relationships might involve Customers placing Orders, with each Order consisting of multiple Products.
In essence, a conceptual data model acts as a blueprint for designing the database schema. It guides the 
subsequent phases of data modeling, ultimately leading to a well-structured and efficiently organized 
database that aligns precisely with the business’s needs.
Physical data model
This translates the conceptual model into a concrete database schema, including tables, columns, data 
types, constraints, and indexes. A physical data model (PDM) is a detailed blueprint that represents 
how data is stored, organized, and accessed within a database management system (DBMS). It is 
a technical representation of the logical design created during the data modeling process. Unlike 
conceptual or conceptual-physical models, a physical data model is closely tied to the specific database 
platform’s implementation details.
The key components of a PDM are as follows:
•	 Tables and columns: A PDM defines the actual tables and their corresponding columns that 
will hold the data. Columns are defined with specific data types and constraints.
•	 Primary and foreign keys: A PDM specifies which columns will be primary keys (unique 
identifiers) and establishes relationships through foreign keys.

Data modeling and schema design
235
•	 Indexes: Indexes are used to speed up data retrieval by providing efficient access paths to data. 
A PDM determines which columns need indexing.
•	 Constraints: Data integrity constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK are defined 
to ensure data quality and consistency.
•	 Triggers and stored procedures: A PDM might include triggers and stored procedures that 
automate specific database actions or enforce business rules.
Its purposes and benefits are as follows:
•	 Implementation guide: A PDM acts as a detailed implementation guide for database developers 
and administrators, ensuring a consistent and accurate database structure
•	 Performance optimization: By defining indexes, constraints, and data types, a PDM helps 
optimize database performance
•	 Data integrity: A PDM enforces data integrity by specifying rules and constraints that data 
must adhere to
•	 Database maintenance: A PDM serves as a reference for ongoing database maintenance tasks, 
such as backups, updates, and modifications
The following is needed to create a PDM:
•	 A logical design: A PDM is derived from a logical data model, taking the high-level entities, 
attributes, and relationships and mapping them onto the specific database platform’s structures.
•	 A choice of database platform: Choose the DBMS that the physical model will be implemented 
on. Different DBMSs have varying storage and indexing mechanisms.
•	 Defintions of columns and constraints: Define the columns, data types, and constraints for 
each table based on the logical model.
•	 Relationships and keys: Specify primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes to ensure data integrity 
and efficient querying.
•	 Normalization and denormalization: Consider normalization and, if necessary, denormalization 
techniques to optimize data storage and retrieval.
Example:
For an e-commerce platform, the PDM might detail tables such as Customers, Orders, and Products, 
defining the columns within each table, relationships, indexes, and constraints.
In essence, a PDM provides the technical specifics required to turn a well-designed logical model 
into a functional database system. It serves as a crucial guide for implementing, maintaining, and 
optimizing the database within the chosen DBMS.

236
Normalization
This technique eliminates data redundancy by organizing data into related tables and minimizing data 
duplication. Normalization is a database design technique that aims to minimize data redundancy and 
maintain data integrity by organizing data into separate tables based on their logical relationships. 
The process involves breaking down a single large table into smaller, related tables that store specific 
types of data, reducing data duplication and potential anomalies. Normalization ensures efficient 
data storage, query performance, and updates while avoiding anomalies such as insertion, update, 
and deletion anomalies.
The key concepts of normalization are as follows:
•	 Functional dependency: Functional dependency indicates that one attribute’s value is dependent 
on another attribute’s value. It forms the basis for normalization.
•	 Normalization forms: There are several normal forms (NFs) that represent increasing levels 
of data normalization. Commonly used ones include first normal form (1NF), second normal 
form (2NF), third normal form (3NF), and Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF):
	 1NF: Each table cell should contain only atomic (indivisible) values, and each column should 
have a unique name
	 2NF: Building upon 1NF, all non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on 
the primary key
	 3NF: Building upon 2NF, 3NF eliminates transitive dependencies, where a non-key attribute 
depends on another non-key attribute through the primary key
	 BCNF: An extension of 3NF, BCNF ensures that there are no non-trivial dependencies 
between candidate keys and non-key attributes
The benefits of normalization are as follows:
•	 Data integrity: Normalization minimizes data redundancy and eliminates update anomalies, 
ensuring that data remains consistent
•	 Storage efficiency: Smaller, well-organized tables lead to efficient storage utilization
•	 Query performance: Normalization can improve query performance by reducing the need 
for complex joins and aggregations
•	 Scalability: Normalized tables can be efficiently expanded without disrupting the existing structure
Its considerations and limitations include the following:
•	 Balance: Over-normalization can lead to complex queries and performance issues, so it’s 
essential to strike a balance between normalization and query efficiency

Data modeling and schema design
237
•	 Application context: The level of normalization should align with the application’s data access 
patterns and usage scenarios
•	 Denormalization: In certain cases, controlled denormalization might be appropriate to enhance 
query performance
Example:
Consider a library management system. The initial unnormalized table might contain columns for 
both book and author information. Through normalization, the data could be divided into separate 
tables for books and authors, reducing redundancy and improving data integrity.
Normalization is a fundamental process in database design that ensures data accuracy, integrity, and 
efficiency. By systematically eliminating data redundancy and organizing data logically, normalization 
sets the foundation for well-structured and maintainable databases.
Denormalization
In contrast to normalization, denormalization involves intentionally introducing redundancy to 
improve query performance, especially in read-heavy scenarios. Denormalization is a database design 
technique that involves intentionally introducing redundancy into a normalized database schema. This 
process aims to improve query performance by reducing the need for complex joins and aggregations, 
especially in scenarios where read operations are more frequent than writes. Denormalization can 
lead to duplication of data, but it serves as a trade-off between data redundancy and query efficiency.
The key concepts of denormalization are as follows:
•	 Redundancy: Denormalization introduces redundant data by storing information in multiple 
places. This contrasts with normalization, where redundancy is minimized.
•	 Query performance: Denormalization focuses on optimizing query performance by reducing 
the number of joins and simplifying data retrieval.
The benefits of denormalization are as follows:
•	 Query efficiency: Complex queries that involve multiple joins can become simpler and faster 
due to reduced join operations
•	 Read-heavy workloads: Denormalization is particularly useful for applications with a heavy 
emphasis on read operations, such as reporting or analytics
•	 Aggregation performance: Aggregations and calculations are more efficient when data is 
pre-joined and pre-calculated

Database Services – Part 2
238
Its considerations and trade-offs include the following:
•	 Data redundancy: Denormalization introduces redundancy, which can lead to data inconsistency 
if updates are not managed carefully
•	 Write performance: While read performance improves, write performance can suffer due to 
increased data modification complexity
•	 Maintenance complexity: Managing redundant data requires careful maintenance to ensure 
data consistency across denormalized copies
When to consider denormalization:
•	 Reporting and analytics: Systems that involve extensive reporting and analytical queries can 
benefit from denormalization
•	 Real-time applications: Applications where real-time data access is critical might opt for 
denormalization to reduce query complexity
•	 Data warehousing: Data warehouses often denormalize data to optimize query performance 
for analytical purposes
Strategies for denormalization include the following:
•	 Combining tables: Join-intensive queries can be optimized by combining multiple normalized 
tables into a single denormalized table
•	 Pre-joined data: Creating tables that already have data joined can accelerate query performance
•	 Caching and materialized views: Storing pre-computed results in materialized views or cache 
can enhance query efficiency
Example:
In an e-commerce platform, denormalization might involve duplicating customer information in the 
order table to avoid joins between customer and order tables when retrieving order history.
In conclusion, denormalization is a deliberate trade-off between data redundancy and query efficiency. 
It is employed to enhance read-heavy workloads and optimize query performance, particularly in 
scenarios where complex joins hinder data retrieval speed. Careful consideration and balance between 
normalized and denormalized data structures are crucial to maintaining data consistency while reaping 
the benefits of improved query performance.

Database security best practices
247
In this section, we explored two vital facets of managing databases in the cloud. Starting with provisioning, 
the section detailed the essential steps and considerations for allocating resources efficiently. Real-world 
examples, including e-commerce, healthcare patient management, and e-learning platforms, showcased 
practical methodologies on platforms such as Microsoft Azure. Transitioning to configuration, the 
focus shifted to fine-tuning database settings for optimal performance and security. These insights, 
coupled with hands-on examples, provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of crafting 
robust, efficient, and secure database environments in diverse cloud scenarios.
The following Database security best practices section delves into essential strategies and measures to 
ensure the security of databases within a cloud environment. It focuses on safeguarding sensitive data, 
preventing unauthorized access, and maintaining data integrity. Readers will learn about a range of 
security practices, including access controls, encryption, auditing, and monitoring. This section aims 
to equip readers with the knowledge to implement comprehensive security measures to protect your 
databases from various threats and vulnerabilities.
Database security best practices
Database security is paramount in ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical data. 
In a cloud environment, where databases are accessible from anywhere, implementing robust security 
practices is crucial to mitigate risks. This section covers a range of measures to fortify database security.
Access control
Implement fine-grained access controls to restrict database access to authorized users only. Use role-
based access control (RBAC) to assign permissions based on user roles. For example, a healthcare 
system might grant doctors access to patient records while limiting administrative access. Access 
control is a fundamental aspect of database security that regulates who can access what data and 
perform which actions within a database system. It prevents unauthorized users from gaining access 
to sensitive information and helps maintain data confidentiality and integrity. We will delve into each 
of these access control models—RBAC, discretionary access control (DAC), mandatory access 
control (MAC), and attribute-based access control (ABAC)—in detail, exploring their functionalities, 
advantages, and considerations in shaping secure and efficient data access within diverse environments.
RBAC
RBAC is a widely used method in access control. It assigns roles to users, and each role has specific 
permissions associated with it. Users are then assigned roles rather than having individual permissions. 
This simplifies the management of permissions and reduces the risk of granting excessive access.

Database Services – Part 2
248
DAC
DAC allows the owner of the data to decide who can access it. Owners can grant or revoke permissions 
on objects such as tables, views, or stored procedures. This model can lead to difficulties in managing 
permissions for large databases.
MAC
MAC enforces access based on a predefined security policy. Data is classified, and users are assigned 
security labels. Access is granted based on matching labels and permissions.
ABAC
ABAC evaluates access decisions based on attributes such as user attributes, resource attributes, and 
context. This allows for more dynamic and fine-grained access control based on various factors.
Popular tools and methods for access control
We will list the tools and methods central to access control that play a pivotal role in ensuring secure 
data environments. The focus areas include RBAC tools such as Amazon IAM, Google Cloud IAM, 
and Azure RBAC. DBMS access control will be explored through MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft 
SQL Server Management Studio. Identity and access management (IAM) solutions such as Okta and 
OneLogin will be highlighted, along with ABAC tools such as Axiomatics. Additionally, we’ll cover

The benefits of effective access control are as follows:
•	 Data confidentiality: Access control prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive 
data, protecting its confidentiality
•	 Data integrity: Only authorized users can modify data, ensuring its integrity and accuracy
•	 Regulatory compliance: Access control helps meet compliance requirements by limiting access 
to authorized personnel
•	 Minimized insider threats: Access control reduces the risk of insider threats, as users are 
restricted to their defined roles
•	 Improved accountability: Auditing user activity ensures accountability for any unauthorized actions
Effective access control ensures that only authorized users have access to the right data at the right 
time, enhancing overall database security within a cloud environment.
Encryption
Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit. Use transparent data encryption (TDE) to encrypt 
data files, preventing unauthorized access to data even if the storage media is compromised. Additionally, 
enable SSL/TLS to encrypt data transmitted between clients and the database server. Encryption is a 
critical security measure that converts plaintext data into ciphertext using cryptographic algorithms. 
This process ensures that even if an unauthorized entity gains access to the data, it won’t be able to 
understand it without the decryption key. Encryption is essential to protecting data confidentiality, 
both at rest and in transit.
Types of encryption include the following:
•	 Symmetric encryption: In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and 
decryption. While it’s efficient, securely distributing the key to all parties can be challenging.
•	 Asymmetric encryption (public key encryption): Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: 
a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Public keys can be openly shared, 
while private keys are kept secret.
•	 Hybrid encryption: This combines both symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Data is encrypted 
with a symmetric key, and then the symmetric key is encrypted with the recipient’s public key.
In the realm of data security, two fundamental aspects play a critical role—encryption at rest and 
encryption in transit. Encrypting data at rest involves securing information stored on various media, 
such as hard drives and databases, safeguarding it from unauthorized access in scenarios of theft 
or compromise. On the other hand, encryption in transit ensures the protection of data during its 
transmission between systems or over networks, thwarting potential eavesdropping and interception 
threats. These encryption practices are foundational in fortifying data integrity and confidentiality 
across storage and communication channels, contributing significantly to overall data security protocols.

be discussing these topics in detail in the chapters that follow.
Least-privilege principle
The least-privilege principle (LPP) is a fundamental security concept that revolves around granting 
users and processes only the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks. It’s based on the idea 
that users should have the least amount of privilege required to complete their work, which reduces 
potential risks and exposure in case of a security breach.
Follow the principle of least privilege, granting users only the permissions necessary for their tasks. 
This minimizes the impact of a compromised account and reduces the attack surface.
Key aspects of the LPP are as follows:
•	 Minimized attack surface: By limiting access to only what’s necessary, potential attack vectors 
and points of vulnerability are significantly reduced
•	 Mitigation of insider threats: Even if a user with malicious intent gains access, their ability to 
cause damage is restricted to the privileges they have

Database Services – Part 2
256
•	 Accidental error prevention: Users with limited access are less likely to accidentally modify 
or delete critical data or settings
•	 Granular access control: The principle promotes finely-tuned control over access, allowing 
organizations to align permissions with specific job roles
•	 Need-to-know basis: Users are granted access only to the data and resources essential to their 
tasks, preventing overexposure
Implementing the LPP entails the following:
•	 RBAC: Assign permissions based on job roles rather than individuals. Users are grouped into 
roles, each with predefined access levels.
•	 Just-in-time access: Provide temporary access for a limited period when needed and then 
revoke it automatically.
•	 Privilege elevation: Implement mechanisms that temporarily elevate a user’s privileges only 
when necessary.
•	 Regular review: Periodically review and audit user permissions to ensure alignment with 
current roles and responsibilities.
•	 Separation of duties (SoD): Divide tasks in a way that no single user has full control over a 
critical process.
Tools and methods to establish least privilege include the following:
1.	
Cloud IAM:
	 Amazon IAM: Controls access to AWS resources
	 Google Cloud IAM: Manages access to GCP services
	 Azure RBAC: Defines permissions for Azure resources

257
5.	
API access control:
	 Use API gateways and tokens to enforce controlled access to APIs
6.	
File system permissions:
	 Set file and directory permissions based on user roles
Implementing the LPP requires careful analysis of user roles, a comprehensive understanding of 
their tasks, and robust access control mechanisms. By adhering to this principle, organizations can 
significantly enhance their security posture and minimize potential vulnerabilities.
Secure configuration
Secure configuration refers to the practice of setting up systems, applications, and devices in a way 
that minimizes security risks and vulnerabilities. It involves configuring settings, permissions, and 
access controls to align with security best practices and industry standards. By implementing secure 
configurations, organizations reduce the attack surface and enhance the overall security posture of 
their IT infrastructure.
Configure databases according to security best practices provided by the database vendor. Disable 
unnecessary features, default accounts, and unused services. Regularly update and patch the DBMS 
to address security vulnerabilities.
Key aspects of secure configuration are as follows:
•	 Hardening systems: Removing unnecessary components, features, and services from systems 
to minimize potential vulnerabilities

and changes are then replicated to one or more slave replicas for read queries
•	 Multi-master replication: Multiple databases act as both masters and slaves, allowing writes 
on any node and ensuring changes are propagated to other nodes
•	 Bi-directional replication: Changes made on any replica are allowed to be synchronized with 
other replicas, ensuring consistency across multiple nodes
Replication methods include the following:
•	 Snapshot-based replication: This method periodically takes a snapshot of the master database 
and copies it to replicas. It’s simple but can lead to delays in data synchronization.
•	 Log-based replication: Changes made to the database’s transaction log are captured and 
replicated, ensuring near real-time data synchronization.
•	 Statement-based replication: This method replicates SQL statements from the master to 
replicas, executing the same statements on replica databases.

high availability, disaster recovery, and optimized performance. Organizations should carefully plan 
their replication strategies, considering factors such as data consistency, replication lag, and failover 
mechanisms to design robust and responsive database architectures.
Automatic failover
Cloud platforms offer automated failover mechanisms that swiftly redirect traffic to a standby instance if 
the primary database becomes unavailable. Automatic failover is a critical component of high-availability 
strategies, ensuring that services remain operational even in the event of hardware or software failures. 
In the context of databases and cloud environments, automatic failover involves seamlessly shifting 
user traffic from a primary instance to a standby instance when the primary becomes unavailable. 
This process minimizes downtime and maintains continuous service availability for users.
The key aspects of automatic failover are as follows:
•	 Detection of failure: Monitoring mechanisms continuously monitor the health of the primary 
instance. If a failure is detected, such as hardware issues, network problems, or software crashes, 
the automatic failover process is initiated.
•	 Promotion of standby instance: The standby instance, often kept synchronized with the primary 
instance through replication, is promoted to become the new primary.
•	 Traffic redirect: Once the standby instance is promoted, incoming user traffic is automatically 
redirected to the new primary instance.
•	 Data consistency: To ensure data consistency, changes that were in progress on the primary 
instance but not yet replicated to the standby are typically rolled forward.
•	 Minimized downtime: Automatic failover aims to minimize the time during which the service 
is unavailable, offering seamless continuity for users.
Cloud provider implementations include the following:
•	 Amazon RDS Multi-AZ: Amazon RDS provides Multi-AZ deployments for database instances, 
ensuring automatic failover to a standby replica in a different availability zone

redundancy and minimizing downtime.
Multi-availability zone (AZ) deployments are a high-availability feature provided by cloud service 
providers, especially in database services such as Amazon RDS, Azure SQL Database, and Google 
Cloud SQL. Multi-AZ deployments involve creating and maintaining synchronized copies of a primary 
database instance in multiple availability zones within a cloud region. The goal is to enhance data 
availability and resilience by ensuring that if one availability zone experiences an outage or failure, 
traffic can be automatically directed to a standby instance in another zone.
The key aspects of Multi-AZ deployments are as follows:
•	 Availability zones: Availability zones are physically separate data centers within a cloud region. 
Each zone has its own power, cooling, and network infrastructure to minimize the risk of 
correlated failures.
•	 Synchronous replication: In a Multi-AZ deployment, the primary database instance is 
synchronously replicated to a standby instance in a different availability zone.
•	 Automatic failover: If the primary instance becomes unavailable due to hardware or software 
issues, the cloud platform initiates an automatic failover to the standby instance.

Database Services – Part 2
268
•	 Data consistency: During automatic failover, any pending changes in the primary instance’s 
transaction log are applied to the standby to maintain data consistency.
The benefits of Multi-AZ deployments include the following:
•	 High availability: Multi-AZ deployments offer improved availability by ensuring that there’s 
always a healthy instance to handle user requests
•	 Automated failover: In case of a failure in the primary zone, the cloud platform automatically 
promotes the standby to become the new primary, minimizing downtime
•	 Disaster recovery: Multi-AZ deployments serve as a disaster recovery solution, safeguarding 
against data center outages or catastrophic failures
•	 Enhanced reliability: Redundancy across multiple availability zones improves overall system 
reliability and reduces the impact of single points of failure

Scalability
Scalability in the context of cloud databases refers to the ability of a database system to accommodate 
varying workloads and growing demands while maintaining optimal performance and responsiveness. 
It’s a critical aspect of modern applications that experience unpredictable spikes in traffic or need to 
handle increasing amounts of data without sacrificing the user experience. Scalability can be achieved 
through two main approaches: vertical scaling (scaling up) and horizontal scaling (scaling out).
Vertical scaling (scaling up)
Vertical scaling involves adding more resources to a single database instance to handle increased 
workload. This typically includes increasing CPU power, memory, storage capacity, or other system 
resources. Vertical scaling is suitable for scenarios where a database’s performance bottlenecks are 
related to the limitations of individual resources.
The benefits of vertical scaling are as follows:

higher risk of a single point of failure
Horizontal scaling (scaling out)
Horizontal scaling involves adding more instances to distribute the workload. This is often done by 
using database replication or sharding techniques to split the data across multiple instances. Horizontal 
scaling is suitable for scenarios where the workload cannot be efficiently handled by a single instance.
The benefits of horizontal scaling are as follows:
•	 Unlimited scalability: Horizontal scaling allows for almost unlimited scalability by adding 
more instances as needed
•	 High availability: By distributing the workload, horizontal scaling enhances availability 
and reliability
The limitations of horizontal scaling include the following:
•	 Complexity: Horizontal scaling can introduce complexity due to managing multiple instances 
and ensuring data consistency
•	 Data sharding challenges: Sharding introduces challenges in maintaining data integrity and 
consistency across multiple instances

Monitoring and Management
300
Here’s a comprehensive look at the key aspects that will be covered in this section:
•	 Auto-scaling: Auto-scaling involves automatically adjusting the number of compute resources, 
such as virtual machines or containers, based on changes in demand. This ensures that the 
application can handle varying levels of traffic without manual intervention. Auto-scaling 
policies can be configured to trigger scaling actions based on metrics such as CPU utilization, 
memory usage, or network traffic.
•	 Load balancing: Load balancing evenly distributes incoming network traffic across multiple 
resources to prevent any single resource from being overwhelmed. Load balancers ensure 
optimal resource utilization, improve fault tolerance, and enhance the overall performance 
and availability of applications.
•	 Elastic Load Balancing (ELB): Cloud providers offer ELB services that automatically distribute 
incoming traffic across multiple instances. This helps optimize application availability and 
performance by distributing traffic evenly and directing it to healthy instances.
•	 Auto-scaling groups: Auto-scaling groups are sets of resources that are managed collectively. 
These groups automatically adjust the number of instances based on defined conditions. As 
demand increases, new instances are launched, and as demand decreases, instances are terminated.
•	 Resource orchestration: Resource orchestration involves managing the deployment and 
scaling of resources through automation. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as AWS 
CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager, and Google Cloud Deployment Manager enable 
users to define and manage resources using code.
•	 Serverless computing: Serverless computing abstracts infrastructure management by allowing 
developers to focus solely on writing code. Cloud providers automatically manage the resources 
required to run functions or applications, scaling them based on incoming events or requests.
•	 Container orchestration: Container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes automate 
the process of deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. They ensure that 
containers are efficiently scheduled and scaled based on application needs.
•	 Benefits:
	 Efficiency: Automated scaling optimizes resource utilization, eliminating over-provisioning 
and reducing costs during periods of low demand
	 Resilience: Load balancing and auto-scaling improve application availability and fault 
tolerance by distributing traffic and resources effectively
	 Performance: Scaling resources up during high demand maintains optimal performance 
for end users
	 Cost Savings: Auto-scaling eliminates the need for manual intervention, optimizing resource 
usage and cost-effectiveness

Automated scaling and resource management
301
	 Elasticity: Applications can easily accommodate varying workloads without manual 
intervention, ensuring a seamless user experience
•	 Real-world examples:
	 During a major online sale, an e-commerce platform uses auto-scaling groups to launch 
additional instances to handle increased traffic, ensuring a smooth shopping experience 
for users
Imagine an e-commerce platform gearing up for a highly anticipated online sale event, where thousands 
of customers are expected to flock to the website looking for deals. In this scenario, the platform 
employs auto-scaling strategies to ensure a seamless shopping experience for users while effectively 
managing its resources and costs:
1.	
Scenario: A highly anticipated sale event on an e-commerce website.
2.	
Preparation: Before the sale event, the e-commerce platform predicts a significant increase in 
traffic and prepares by setting up an auto-scaling group in their cloud infrastructure.
3.	
Auto-scaling policies: The platform defines auto-scaling policies based on metrics such as 
CPU utilization and incoming requests. They determine that if the CPU utilization crosses a 
certain threshold, new instances will be launched automatically.
4.	
Event launch: As the sale event begins, user traffic starts to surge, causing CPU utilization to 
increase rapidly.
5.	
Auto-scaling trigger: The auto-scaling policies are triggered, and the platform’s cloud environment 
recognizes the need for additional resources to handle the traffic influx.
6.	
Instance launch: The auto-scaling group launches new instances of the application to accommodate 
the increased load. These new instances are quickly provisioned and integrated into the 
application pool.
7.	
Balanced traffic: The load balancer seamlessly distributes incoming traffic across all 
instances, ensuring that no single instance becomes overwhelmed and that users experience 
consistent performance.
8.	
Traffic subsides: As the sale event ends and user traffic subsides, the auto-scaling group detects 
the decrease in demand.
9.	
Instance termination: The auto-scaling group scales down by terminating the unnecessary 
instances, thereby saving costs by only utilizing the resources needed.
10.	 Benefits and insights:
	 Seamless user experience: Auto-scaling ensures that users experience quick load times and 
minimal downtime, even during peak traffic periods
	 Cost efficiency: The platform avoids over-provisioning resources, only paying for the 
resources consumed during the peak period

Monitoring and Management
302
	 Resource optimization: Auto-scaling effectively manages resource allocation, preventing 
underutilization during off-peak times
	 Easy management: The entire process is automated, reducing the need for manual intervention 
and allowing the platform’s team to focus on other aspects of the event
This real-world example demonstrates the effectiveness of auto-scaling in handling sudden spikes 
in demand, such as during online sales or promotional events. By dynamically adjusting resources 
to match traffic fluctuations, businesses can provide an optimal user experience while maintaining 
cost efficiency and operational ease. For example, a video streaming service might leverage serverless 
computing to automatically scale its backend functions based on incoming requests, optimizing 
resource usage and reducing operational overhead.
Consider a ride-sharing application that experiences varying levels of user activity throughout the day. 
To efficiently handle the fluctuating demand and ensure seamless user experiences, the application 
leverages serverless computing in its cloud environment:
1.	
Scenario: A ride-sharing application with varying levels of user activity.
2.	
Architecture design: The application is designed using a serverless architecture. Instead of 
provisioning and managing traditional virtual machines or containers, the application consists 
of individual serverless functions.
3.	
Function deployment: Different functions are created to handle various aspects of the application, 
such as user authentication, ride booking, and driver matching.
4.	
Event-driven scaling: The serverless functions are event-driven, meaning they are invoked in 
response to specific events, such as user requests.
5.	
Scaling mechanism: When user activity is low, only a few serverless functions are active. As 
the number of user requests increases, the serverless platform automatically scales out by 
deploying additional instances of the functions.
6.	
Resource allocation: Each function instance is allocated resources (CPU, memory, and so on) 
on demand. The cloud provider manages the resource allocation process, ensuring optimal 
performance and resource utilization.
7.	
Peak periods: During peak hours, such as rush hour or weekends, the application experiences 
a surge in ride requests.
8.	
Dynamic scaling: The serverless platform detects the increase in incoming events and scales 
out by launching multiple instances of the functions to handle the higher load.
9.

available, including full backups, incremental backups, and differential backups. You will learn when 
to employ each strategy, depending on your data protection needs, recovery goals, and resource 
constraints. By comprehending these strategies, you will be well equipped to make informed decisions 
on how to effectively and efficiently back up your critical data in the cloud, ensuring its availability 
and recoverability in case of unforeseen incidents or data loss scenarios.
Data backup strategies are essential components of any robust data protection plan, especially in cloud 
computing, where data is the lifeblood of digital operations. This section explores various backup 
strategies and provides an in-depth understanding of each.
Full backups
A full backup involves copying all data in a system or dataset to a backup location. While this ensures 
comprehensive data recovery, it can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, making it ideal for 
critical data that doesn’t change frequently.
Here, I’ll provide a detailed overview of full backups, their characteristics, advantages, and considerations.
The characteristics of full backups include the following:
•	 Comprehensive data capture: A full backup captures all the data in a given system or dataset, 
leaving no file or piece of information behind. This includes both active and archived data.
•	 Independent restore point: Full backups create an independent restore point. This means 
that you can restore data from a full backup without the need for any previous backup files. It 
stands alone as a complete snapshot of your data.
•	 Resource-intensive: Creating full backups can be resource-intensive in terms of storage space, 
network bandwidth, and time. This is because every piece of data is copied in its entirety, 
regardless of whether it has changed since the last backup.

Data backup strategies
317
Advantages of full backups include:
•	 Simplicity and reliability: Full backups are straightforward to create and restore from. There’s 
no need to track multiple backup versions or worry about the order of restore operations. This 
simplicity can be advantageous, especially for critical data.
•	 Complete data recovery: Full backups offer the highest level of data recovery assurance. In 
the event of data loss, you can restore your entire dataset to a specific point in time, ensuring 
no data is left behind.
•	 Independence: Each full backup is independent of previous backups. If one full backup becomes 
corrupt or unavailable, you can still rely on others to restore your data.
The considerations for full backups include the following:
•	 Resource usage: Due to their comprehensive nature, full backups consume significant storage 
space and can strain network resources during backup operations. This makes them less suitable 
for frequent backups of large datasets.
•	 Backup window: The time required to perform a full backup can be substantial. Organizations 
need to plan for backup windows that won’t disrupt regular operations.
•	 Retention and cost: Storing multiple full backups over time can lead to higher storage costs 
compared to incremental or differential backups.
The use cases include the following:
•	 Critical data: Full backups are often used for critical data that requires the highest level of 
protection and assurance in case of data loss
•	 DR: They are a key component of DR plans (DRPs), ensuring a complete dataset can be restored 
in the event of catastrophic data loss
Full backups are a reliable and straightforward data protection strategy, ideal for safeguarding critical 
data and ensuring comprehensive recovery capabilities. However, their resource-intensive nature and 
storage requirements should be carefully considered when implementing backup strategies in a cloud 
or an on-premises environment.
Incremental backups
Incremental backups only copy data that has changed since the last backup, reducing storage and 
bandwidth requirements. These backups are faster and more efficient, but restoring data requires 
the most recent full backup and all subsequent incremental backups. Incremental backups are a data 
protection strategy that captures and stores only data that has changed since the last backup, whether 
it’s a full backup or a previous incremental backup. This approach offers efficiency in terms of storage 
space and backup duration. Next, I’ll provide a detailed overview of incremental backups, including 
their characteristics, advantages, and considerations.

Backup and Restore Mechanisms
318
The characteristics of incremental backups include the following:
•	 Capturing changes: Incremental backups focus on changes made to data since the last backup. 
This can include newly created files, modified files, or deleted files (as deletion is considered 
a change).
•	 Dependency on previous backups: To restore data from an incremental backup, you need 
the most recent full backup and all subsequent incremental backups in the correct order. Each 
incremental backup relies on the previous backup for a complete dataset.
•	 Reduced resource usage: Compared to full backups, incremental backups are more resource-
efficient. They require less storage space and less time to execute since they capture only 
changed data.
The advantages of incremental backups include the following:
•	 Efficiency: Incremental backups are efficient in terms of storage and bandwidth usage. They 
reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred and stored since only changes are captured.
•	 Faster backup operations: Since only changed data is backed up, incremental backups are 
quicker to perform than full backups. This reduces the impact on network resources and 
minimizes the backup window.
•	 Lower storage costs: Storing incremental backups generally requires less storage space compared 
to full backups, making it a cost-effective strategy for long-term data retention.
The considerations for incremental backups include:
•	 Dependency on chain: Incremental backups are dependent on the entire backup chain. If any 
part of the chain becomes corrupted or unavailable, it can affect the ability to restore data.
•	 Restore complexity: Restoring data from incremental backups can be more complex, as you 
need to ensure that all necessary incremental backups are available and in the correct order.
•	 Resource efficiency versus full recovery: While incremental backups are resource-efficient, they 
may not provide the same level of data recovery assurance as full backups in certain scenarios.
The use cases include:
•	 Frequent backups: Incremental backups are ideal for situations where frequent backups are 
necessary, such as backing up data multiple times a day
•	 Balancing resources: They help balance resource usage (storage, bandwidth, and processing) 
by capturing only the most recent changes
•	 Backup window reduction: Organizations with limited backup windows can benefit from the 
faster execution of incremental backups

Data backup strategies
319
Incremental backups offer a balance between resource efficiency and data recovery capabilities. They 
are particularly suitable for scenarios where frequent backups are needed and resource constraints must 
be managed effectively. However, their dependency on previous backups requires careful management 
to ensure reliable data restoration.
Differential backups
Differential backups are another approach to data protection, distinct from both full and incremental 
backups. These backups capture all changes made to data since the last full backup, providing a middle 
ground between the comprehensive nature of full backups and the efficiency of incremental backups. 
Here’s a detailed overview of differential backups.
The characteristics of differential backups include:
•	 Capturing changes since the last full backup: A differential backup captures all changes made 
to data since the last full backup. Unlike incremental backups, it doesn’t rely on the previous 
backup in the chain; instead, it captures changes since the last full backup.
•	 Independent restore point: Similar to a full backup, a differential backup creates an independent 
restore point. It can be used alone to restore data to a specific point in time without the need 
for other differential backups.
•	 Cumulative changes: Differential backups accumulate changes made to the data over time. 
For example, the second differential backup captures changes since the first differential backup, 
and so on.
The advantages of differential backups include:
•	 Simplicity of restoration: Restoring data from differential backups is simpler compared to 
incremental backups. To restore to a specific point in time, you only need the last full backup 
and the most recent differential backup.
•	 Less dependency: Differential backups are less dependent on the backup chain compared to 
incremental backups. You only need the most recent full backup and the latest differential 
backup for restoration.
•	 Faster restoration than incremental backups: While differential backups capture more data 
than incremental backups, they usually require fewer backup files for restoration, making the 
process faster.
The considerations for differential backups include:
•	 Increasing size over time: Since a differential backup captures all changes since the last full 
backup, its size tends to increase over time. This can impact storage requirements.
•	 Backup window: Depending on the frequency of full backups, the backup window might be 
longer for differential backups compared to incremental backups.

Backup and Restore Mechanisms
320
The use cases include:
•	 Balancing between full and incremental: Differential backups provide a balance between the 
comprehensive nature of full backups and the efficiency of incremental backups
•	 Simplified restoration: They are suitable for scenarios where a simplified restoration process 
is preferred over the more complex restoration process of incremental backups
In summary, differential backups offer a middle ground between the simplicity of full backups and the 
efficiency of incremental backups. They provide a compromise in terms of storage efficiency and ease 
of restoration, making them suitable for certain backup strategies and data protection requirements.
Synthetic full backups
Synthetic full backups are a strategy in data protection that creates a full backup by combining a 
previous full backup with subsequent incremental or differential backups. This process is performed 
without the need to read all data from the source, providing efficiency in terms of time and resource 
usage. Here’s a detailed overview of synthetic full backups.
The characteristics of synthetic full backups include:
•	 Combining incremental or differential backups: Instead of creating a new full backup by 
reading all data from the source, a synthetic full backup combines a previous full backup with 
subsequent incremental or differential backups.
•	 Reduced source impact: Since synthetic full backups don’t involve reading data directly from 
the source, they reduce the impact on the source system. This is particularly beneficial when 
the source system experiences high workloads or performance constraints.
•	 Creation at the backup location: Synthetic full backups are typically created at the backup 
location or storage repository rather than at the source system. This can be performed by the 
backup software or appliance.
The advantages of synthetic full backups include:
•	 Reduced source load: By not directly accessing the source system, synthetic full backups 
minimize the impact on the source system’s performance during backup operations
•	 Time and resource efficiency: Creating a synthetic full backup is often faster and more resource-
efficient than reading all data from the source, especially in scenarios with large datasets
•	 Storage efficiency: Synthetic full backups contribute to storage efficiency by consolidating 
changes from incremental or differential backups into a new full backup without duplicating 
unchanged data

Data backup strategies
321
The considerations for synthetic full backups include:
•	 Dependency on previous backups: Similar to incremental and differential backups, synthetic 
full backups depend on the availability of the previous full backup and subsequent incremental 
or differential backups
•	 Storage impact: While synthetic full backups contribute to storage efficiency, they still require 
sufficient storage space to store the consolidated full backup
The use cases include:
•	 Reducing backup window: Synthetic full backups are suitable for scenarios where reducing 
the backup window is critical, as they can be created faster than traditional full backups
•	 Minimizing source impact: Organizations with source systems that are sensitive to performance 
impact during backup operations can benefit from synthetic full backups
•	 Storage optimization: Synthetic full backups contribute to storage optimization by creating 
consolidated full backups without duplicating unchanged data
In summary, synthetic full backups offer a strategy to create efficient full backups by combining 
previous full backups with incremental or differential backups. They provide advantages in terms of 
reduced source impact, time efficiency, and storage optimization, making them a valuable component 
of a comprehensive backup strategy.
Mirror backups
Mirror backups, also known as copy backups, involve creating an exact copy of the source data in a 
separate location without any form of compression or incremental changes. Here’s a detailed discussion 
of mirror backups.
The characteristics of mirror backups include:
•	 Full copy of source data: Mirror backups involve copying the entire dataset, creating an 
identical, uncompressed replica of the source data
•	 Independent of incremental changes: Unlike incremental or differential backups that capture 
changes made since the last backup, mirror backups are standalone copies, independent of 
previous backups
•	 Not storage-efficient: Mirror backups are not storage-efficient because they replicate the entire 
dataset every time, even if only a small portion has changed
The advantages of mirror backups include:
•	 Simplicity: Mirror backups are straightforward and easy to understand. They involve a direct, 
full copy of the source data without complex algorithms for tracking changes.

Backup and Restore Mechanisms
322
•	 Independence: Each mirror backup is independent, making it suitable for scenarios where you 
might want a standalone copy of the data, unaffected by the history of incremental changes.
•	 Quick recovery: Since each mirror backup is a complete copy of the data, the recovery process 
is straightforward and quick.
The considerations for mirror backups include:
•	 Storage requirements: Mirror backups consume a significant amount of storage space, as they 
duplicate the entire dataset
•	 Time and resources: Creating mirror backups can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, 
especially when dealing with large datasets
The use cases include:
•	 Data archiving: Mirror backups can be used for archiving purposes when you need a complete, 
independent copy of the data at a specific point in time
•	 Data duplication: In scenarios where maintaining an exact replica is crucial, such as for 
regulatory compliance or data validation, mirror backups can be useful
Here’s a comparison with other backup types:
•	 Differential and incremental backups: Mirror backups contrast with differential and incremental 
backups, which focus on capturing changes since the last backup, making them more storage-
efficient but potentially complex
•	 Synthetic full backups: Unlike synthetic full backups that consolidate changes into a new full 
backup, mirror backups create standalone, complete copies
In summary, mirror backups offer a straightforward approach to data protection by creating full, 
independent copies of the source data. While they may not be as storage-efficient as incremental 
or differential backups, they are valuable in scenarios where maintaining exact replicas or creating 
independent copies is a priority.
Continuous data protection 
Continuous data protection (CDP) is a backup and recovery technique that enables the real-time 
or near-real-time capture of every change made to data. This approach ensures that the backup is a 
mirror image of the production system at any point in time, providing a comprehensive and granular 
backup strategy. Here’s a detailed discussion of CDP.
The characteristics of CDP include:
•	 Real-time or near-real-time: CDP captures changes to data as they occur or at very short 
intervals, ensuring that the backup is almost in sync with the production system.

Data backup strategies
323
•	 Granular recovery points: CDP allows for granular recovery points, meaning that you can 
restore data to any specific point in time, not just predefined intervals.
•	 Minimal RPO: CDP aims to minimize the RPO, representing the amount of data loss in the 
event of a failure. With near-real-time capture, the data loss is typically minimal.
•	 Continuous monitoring: CDP systems continuously monitor changes at the block or file level, 
depending on the implementation, to ensure that every modification is captured.
The advantages of CDP include:
•	 Minimized data loss: CDP significantly reduces data loss in the event of a failure because 
changes are captured almost instantly
•	 Granular recovery: The ability to restore to any specific point in time provides granularity in 
recovery, allowing for precise restoration of data
•	 Reduced backup windows: Since CDP operates continuously, there is no need for large backup 
windows that may impact production systems
•	 Less impact on production systems: CDP systems often have minimal impact on the performance 
of production systems since they capture changes at a low level
The considerations for CDP include:
•	 Resource intensiveness: CDP systems can be resource-intensive, especially if changes are 
captured at a very fine level of granularity
•	 Storage requirements: Continuous capture of changes can lead to significant storage requirements, 
especially for systems with high transaction rates
The use cases include:
•	 Mission-critical systems: CDP is often employed for mission-critical systems where minimizing 
data loss is crucial
•	 Regulatory compliance: In industries with stringent regulatory requirements, CDP ensures 
that data is continuously protected and recoverable
Here’s a comparison with other backup types:
•	 Incremental backups: CDP differs from traditional incremental backups by capturing changes 
continuously rather than at predefined intervals
•	 Snapshot-based backups: While both CDP and snapshots capture changes, CDP provides a 
more continuous and granular approach

Backup and Restore Mechanisms
324
In summary, CDP is a backup strategy that aims to minimize data loss by capturing changes in near 
real time. It offers granular recovery options and is particularly valuable for mission-critical systems 
where minimizing downtime and data loss is essential. However, it’s important to consider resource 
requirements and storage implications when implementing CDP.
Snapshot backups
Snapshot backups are a method of capturing the state of a system or data at a specific point in time. 
Unlike traditional backups that copy data to a separate location, snapshots create a point-in-time (PIT) 
reference or snapshot of the data in its current state. Here’s a detailed discussion of snapshot backups.
The characteristics of snapshot backups include:
•	 PIT capture: Snapshots capture the state of data at a specific moment, creating a reference 
point for recovery.
•	 Incremental changes: Subsequent snapshots only capture changes made since the last snapshot. 
This is achieved through the use of pointers or copy-on-write mechanisms, making snapshots 
more storage-efficient.
•	 Fast and efficient: Creating a snapshot is generally fast and efficient, as it involves recording 
differences rather than copying the entire dataset.
•	 Read-only reference: Snapshots are typically read-only references to the data. They allow users 
to view or revert to the state of the data at the time of the snapshot.
The advantages of snapshot backups include:
•	 Fast recovery: Snapshots enable fast recovery by providing a PIT reference that can be used 
to roll back data to a specific state.
•	 Storage efficiency: Since snapshots capture incremental changes, they are more storage-efficient 
compared to full backups. Only changes since the last snapshot need to be stored.
•	 Low impact: Snapshot creation has a minimal impact on system performance, making them 
suitable for environments where downtime must be minimized.
The considerations for snapshot backups include:
•	 Dependency on storage technology: The effectiveness of snapshot backups depends on the 
underlying storage technology. Some storage systems may not support efficient snapshot 
creation or may have limitations.
•	 Limited retention: Snapshots are typically retained for a limited duration due to storage 
constraints. Long-term retention may require additional storage resources.

Data backup strategies
325
The use cases include:
•	 Quick rollback: Snapshots are useful for quickly rolling back data to a known good state in 
case of errors or data corruption
•	 Testing and development: Snapshots provide a convenient way to create a baseline for testing 
and development environments
Here’s a comparison with other backup types:
•	 CDP: CDP captures changes continuously, while snapshots provide PIT references. CDP may 
offer more granularity in recovery.
•	 Incremental backups: Snapshots are similar to incremental backups in that they capture 
changes, but snapshots are typically more space-efficient.
In summary, snapshot backups provide a fast and efficient way to capture the state of data at specific 
points in time. They are useful for quick recovery and are particularly effective when storage efficiency 
is a priority. However, the effectiveness of snapshots may depend on the underlying storage technology 
and the specific requirements of the environment.

Amazon Web Services (AWS)
In AWS, the cornerstone is Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), which provides a highly durable and 
scalable object storage solution. Backup procedures often involve utilizing AWS Backup, a fully managed 
backup service that centralizes and automates the backup process for a variety of AWS resources. For 
databases, AWS offers services such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) with automated 
backup and restore features. Restoration can be initiated through the AWS Management Console or 
programmatically using the AWS Command-Line Interface (CLI).
Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides robust backup and restore services for its RDS, ensuring data 
durability and recovery capabilities. Here’s an overview:
•	 Automated backups: AWS RDS offers automated backups as a fundamental feature. These 
backups are automatically taken daily during the maintenance window. They capture the entire 
database instance, including the database instance’s entire storage volume. Automated backups 
are retained for a specified retention period, and during a restore, you can choose any point 
within this retention period.
•	 Database snapshots: Database snapshots are user-initiated backups that you can create at any 
time. Unlike automated backups, database snapshots are retained even if you delete the original 
database instance. They are stored until you explicitly choose to delete them. This feature is 
handy for creating backups before making significant changes to your database.
Let’s walk through an example of creating a database snapshot in AWS for an RDS instance using the 
AWS Management Console.

5.	
Advanced options (optional):
	 You can specify additional settings such as enabling encryption for the snapshot, or you can 
add tags for better organization.
6.	
Create a snapshot:
	 Click on the Create Snapshot button to initiate the snapshot creation process.
7.	
Monitor the snapshot creation process:
	 You can monitor the progress of the snapshot’s creation in the RDS console. Once completed, 
your new database snapshot will be listed.
AWS CLI command
If you prefer to use the AWS CLI, you can achieve the same using the following command:
aws rds create-db-snapshot --db-snapshot-identifier your-snapshot-name 
--db-instance-identifier your-db-instance-name
Replace your-snapshot-name with a unique identifier for your snapshot and your-db-
instance-name with the name of your RDS instance.
Here are some important considerations:
•	 Ensure that your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user has the necessary 
permissions to create snapshots
•	 Regularly review and manage your snapshots, as they contribute to storage costs
This example demonstrates the simplicity of creating a database snapshot through the AWS Management 
Console or CLI, providing a point-in-time recovery (PITR) option for your RDS instance.
PITR
PITR allows you to restore a database instance to any specific second during your retention period. 
This feature uses both automated backups and database snapshots to provide granular control over 
the recovery point. PITR is particularly useful for recovering from user errors or database corruption.
In AWS, PITR allows you to restore a database to any specific time, down to a fraction of a second, 
within your specified retention period. Let’s look at an example of setting up PITR for an Amazon 
RDS instance.

Backup and restore procedures
371
Example: PITR in AWS RDS:
1.	
Navigate to the AWS Management Console: Log in to the AWS Management Console and 
navigate to the Amazon RDS dashboard.
2.	
Select the RDS instance: Choose the RDS instance for which you want to enable PITR.
3.	
Enable PITR: In the RDS dashboard, select the target RDS instance and, under the Backup tab, 
find the Backup retention period setting. Set an appropriate retention period.
4.	
Apply changes: Click on the Modify button to apply the changes. AWS will start taking automatic 
backups, retaining them according to the specified period.
5.	
Restore to a point in time: Once the backups have been created, you can restore the database 
to any specific point in time within the retention period. Go to the Databases section, select 
your instance, and click on Restore to a point in time.
6.	
Specify a time: Choose the desired time for recovery; AWS will handle the restoration process, 
creating a new instance.
7.	
Confirm and restore: Confirm your settings and click Restore DB Instance. AWS will initiate 
the process of creating a new RDS instance based on the selected point in time.
8.	
Access the restored database: Once the restoration is complete, you’ll have a new RDS instance 
representing the database at the specified point in time.
This process provides a powerful mechanism to recover from accidental data loss or database corruption 
by reverting to a specific point in time.
Now, let’s learn how to enable PITR for an Amazon RDS instance using the AWS CLI.
Example: Enabling PITR with the AWS CLI:
1.	
Set the backup retention period: Use the modify-db-instance command to set the backup 
retention period:
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier 
YourDBInstanceIdentifier --backup-retention-period 7
This command sets the retention period to 7 days. Adjust the value based on your requirements.
2.	
Enable automatic backups: Ensure that automatic backups are enabled. This is often the default 
setting, but you can explicitly set it using the following command:
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier 
YourDBInstanceIdentifier --backup-retention-period 7 
--preferred-backup-window "08:00-08:30"
Here, we’re also setting a preferred backup window, though it’s optional.

Backup and Restore Procedures
372
3.	
Monitor the modifications: Monitor the modifications using the following command:
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier 
YourDBInstanceIdentifier
Check LatestRestorableTime in the output to confirm that the changes have been applied.
4.	
Restore to a point in time: To restore the database to a specific point in time, use the restore-
db-instance-to-point-in-time command:
aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time --source-db-
instance-identifier YourDBInstanceIdentifier --target-db-
instance-identifier YourRestoredDBInstanceIdentifier --restore-
time 2023-09-28T12:30:00
5.	
Adjust the --restore-time parameter to the desired point in time.
6.	
Monitor the restoration: Monitor the status of the restoration:
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier 
YourRestoredDBInstanceIdentifier
Wait for the status to become available.
These commands leverage the AWS CLI for managing Amazon RDS instances and illustrate the process 
of enabling PITR and restoring to a specific point in time. Adjust the identifiers and timestamps 
accordingly for your use case.
AWS Backup integration
AWS Backup is a centralized, fully managed backup service that allows you to back up data across 
AWS services, including RDS. It provides a unified backup solution, enabling you to manage and 
monitor backups across multiple AWS resources.
AWS Backup is a centralized backup service that makes it easy to manage and automate backups across 
various AWS services. Let’s look at an example of how to integrate AWS Backup with an Amazon 
RDS instance.
Example: AWS Backup integration for Amazon RDS:
1.	
Create an AWS Backup plan: First, create an AWS Backup plan using the create-backup-
plan command. Specify the resources to be backed up, such as the Amazon RDS instance:
aws backup create-backup-plan --backup-plan-name 
YourBackupPlan --rule-name YourBackupRule --resource-arn-list 
arn:aws:rds:region:account-id:db:YourDBInstance
This will create a backup plan named YourBackupPlan with a rule named YourBackupRule 
for the specified RDS instance.

Backup and restore procedures
373
2.	
Assign the backup plan: Assign the backup plan to the RDS instance:
aws backup start-backup-job --backup-vault-name default 
--resource-arn arn:aws:rds:region:account-id:db:YourDBInstance 
--iam-role-arn arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/service-role/
AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole
This command starts a backup job for the RDS instance using the specified backup plan.
3.	
Monitor backup jobs: Monitor the status of backup jobs:
aws backup list-backup-jobs --by-backup-vault-name default 
--resource-arn arn:aws:rds:region:account-id:db:YourDBInstance
Check for the completion of backup jobs.
4.	
Restore from a backup: If needed, restore the RDS instance from a backup using the restore-
db-instance-from-aws-backup command:
aws rds restore-db-instance-from-aws-backup --db-instance-
identifier YourRestoredDBInstance --backup-arn 
arn:aws:rds:region:account-id:backup:backup-id
Specify the backup ARN you obtained from the AWS Backup console.
This example demonstrates how to integrate AWS Backup with Amazon RDS, allowing you to manage 
and monitor backups centrally. Adjust the identifiers and parameters based on your setup.
Cross-region automated backups
For additional redundancy and disaster recovery, you can enable cross-region automated backups. This 
feature creates a copy of your automated backups in a different AWS region, enhancing data resilience.
Multi-Availability Zone (AZ) deployments
In multi-Availability Zone (AZ) deployments, AWS RDS automatically replicates your database to a 
standby instance in a different availability zone. In the event of a failure, AWS automatically switches 
to the standby instance, providing high availability and reducing the risk of data loss.
These backup and restore mechanisms in AWS RDS empower users with comprehensive data protection 
and recovery options, ensuring the integrity and availability of their databases.
Microsoft Azure
Azure employs Azure Backup as a comprehensive solution for data protection. Azure Backup supports 
various workloads, including virtual machines, databases, and files. For instance, Azure Virtual 
Machines can be backed up using Azure Backup Vaults, and the restore process is facilitated through 
the Azure portal. Azure’s SQL Database service also integrates automatic backups with point-in-time 
restore capabilities.

Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
In GCP, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) acts as a robust platform for backup storage. Google Cloud’s 
snapshot feature is widely used for creating point-in-time backups of persistent disks. Google Cloud 
SQL, the managed database service, incorporates automatic daily backups that can be restored with 
a few clicks through the Google Cloud Console. GCP’s IaC tool, Deployment Manager, allows you to 
restore entire environments.
GCP provides several services for backup and restore, each designed to cater to different data types 
and use cases. Here are some key services:
•	 Google Cloud Storage (GCS):
	 Backup: GCS is a highly durable and available object storage service. You can use it to back 
up and store various types of data, including images, videos, and other unstructured data.
	 Restore: Data stored in GCS can be easily restored through the GCP console, the gsutil 
command-line tool, or programmatically using APIs.

Backup and restore procedures
381
Let’s consider a scenario where you want to back up a local file to GCS using the gsutil command-
line tool. Here are the steps:
1.

If you don’t have a GCS bucket, create one using the following command:
Replace [BUCKET_NAME] with your desired bucket name:
gsutil mb -c regional -l us-central1 gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
4.	
Perform the backup:
Now, you can back up a local file to your GCS bucket. Replace [LOCAL_FILE] with the path 
to your local file and [BUCKET_NAME] with your GCS bucket:
gsutil cp [LOCAL_FILE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/
For example, let’s say you want to back up a file named example.txt located in your home 
directory to a bucket named my-backups. The commands would be as follows:
gsutil mb -c regional -l us-central1 gs://my-backups
gsutil cp ~/example.txt gs://my-backups/
This example creates a bucket named my-backups and then copies the local file, example.
txt, to that bucket.
Here are some notes:
	 Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform these operations
	 Customize the bucket name, file path, and other parameters based on your requirements
Now, let’s go through the process of restoring a file from GCS to your local machine using the gsutil 
command-line tool.
For this, you must make sure you have the gsutil command-line tool installed and that you’ve 
authenticated with your Google Cloud account (as explained previously).

Backup and Restore Procedures
382
Restoring a file
Follow these steps:
1.	
List objects in the bucket:
You need to identify the object (file) you want to restore. List the objects in your bucket using 
the following command:
gsutil ls gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/
Replace [BUCKET_NAME] with the name of your GCS bucket. This command will display a 
list of objects in the bucket.
2.	
Restore the file:
Now, you can restore the file from GCS to your local machine. Use the following command:
gsutil cp gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/[OBJECT_NAME] [LOCAL_DESTINATION]
Replace [BUCKET_NAME] with your bucket name, [OBJECT_NAME] with the name of the 
object you want to restore (obtained from the list command), and [LOCAL_DESTINATION] 
with the path where you want to restore the file locally.
For example, let’s say you want to restore the example.txt file from the my-backups 
bucket to your home directory.
This command copies the specified object from the bucket to your local machine.
Here are some notes:
	 Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform these operations
	 Customize the bucket name, object name, local destination, and other parameters based 
on your requirements
