Your Brain, 
Mind, and 
Business 
Transformation
It is not enough to have a good mind. The main thing is to use it well.
—René Descartes, Le Discours de la Méthode
Information overload is the new normal. We have too much to think about and 
too little time to manage the rush of information coming at us from multiple 
sources. The nonstop tsunami of structured and unstructured data that slams 
into our lives throughout our waking hours—and, for some of us, throughout 
our sleeping hours—can adversely affect our clarity of thought and, thus, our 
decision-making abilities. As such, it has become a monumental challenge for 
executives and decision-makers to keep themselves and their teams focused 
on doing the right things and on making the best business decisions.
It’s also extremely difficult to change or transform your business when you 
don’t know what to focus on first, where to start, and how best to view 
things. Organizational transformation impacts people, processes, technology,

and information. It comes in different styles, shapes, and forms, whether in the 
guise of a merger or acquisition, a new initiative or program, a consolidation 
of internal departments, or a reduction of unnecessary administrative costs. 
Transformation may be centered on a department, a division, an entire enter-
prise, or across multiple companies.
But before you can begin the process of transforming your business, you and 
your employees must develop the right mindset.
The Brain and Transformational Intelligence
What is that mindset?
In order to describe it, we need to discuss how the brain works. Certain parts 
of the brain are analytic, others are intuitive, other parts are social, and some 
are just plain anxious. The key is to realize where your own brain fits into the 
scheme. The rule that every individual is defined as a composite of strengths 
in some areas and weaknesses in others extends to all the multifarious facets 
of the human brain, mind, and consciousness.
How do you base your decisions? Do you consider yourself more intuitive 
or analytical? If you’re an intuitive decision maker, you base your decisions on 
“feelings” that you get. Your ideas come from bursts of creativity. If you’re 
an analytical decision maker, you base your decisions on historical data. You 
crunch the numbers that your business generates and extract patterns from 
them. Then you use those patterns to change course as needed.
The problem is that neither of these modalities, when used separately, will 
transform your business. Ideas that come from a burst of creativity, like the 
kind that employees spontaneously throw out in the middle of a meeting, 
often are not supported by data. Ideas based on data often involve doing 
either more, or less, of something you’re already doing, rather than being 
based on something new.
The best way to accomplish transformation in your organization is to use an 
approach that combines both intuitive and analytical thinking. This creates 
what I call “Transformational Intelligence.”
What makes Transformational Intelligence different from ordinary intelligence is 
that you use the whole brain, as opposed to using your brain only in the way that 
comes naturally to you. Organizations are most successful when a company 
culture is created where everyone works this way, not just you. Transformational 
Intelligence uses neuroscience, psychology, organizational behavior, and analytics 
to drive and transform business performance, while improving collaboration  
and communication. It helps decision makers and executives drive value by 
providing a framework to define strategic initiatives, improve financial goals, 
exceed customer satisfaction, streamline business processes and tools, and 
motivate employees to become innovative and creative.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind

The Four Essential Transformational 
Intelligences for Business
There are four core areas where Transformational Intelligence has the big-
gest effect. Each of these areas requires its own particular Transformational 
Intelligence:
• 
Financial Intelligence: The ability to collect and use 
financial data to generate insights that inform intelligent 
decision making regarding items like cash flow, profitability,  
and growth, as well as quality and productivity.
• 
Customer Intelligence: The understanding of who 
your customers are and how to attract, find, reach, and 
connect with them, through the lenses of sales and mar-
keting, customer support and services, and partner and 
supplier relationships.
• 
Data Intelligence: The creation of standardized internal 
processes, procedures, systems, and activities across an 
organization made transparent and universally compre-
hended through collaboration and the communication of 
timely visual data. This cohesive approach enables trans-
formative, value-creating decisions.
• 
Mastermind Intelligence: The brainstorming of ideas 
and solutions in a nonjudgmental, well-respected envi-
ronment. It is about empowering employees to be inno-
vative, engaging partners and customers, and finding ways 
to support those partners and customers you’ve con-
nected with.
These intelligences are all interlinked. Financial Intelligence requires 
Customer Intelligence, otherwise there won’t be any money coming in. 
Customer Intelligence requires the transformative decisions enabled by 
Data Intelligence in order to create the value that brings in customers. Data 
Intelligence needs Mastermind Intelligence in order to act on the infor-
mation that is discovered by collaboration throughout the organization. 
Mastermind Intelligence loops back to Financial Intelligence, to assess the 
financial requirements of the actions created by Mastermind Intelligence, 
since everything an organization implements requires either money or a 
reallocation of manpower and resources.

Chapter 1 | Your Brain, Mind, and Business Transformation

These Four Transformational Intelligences were shaped by the work I’ve done 
with organizations over the past 15 years, as well as lessons I’ve learned from 
my colleagues and mentors. Time and again, the solutions I helped put into place 
boiled down to these four aspects of intelligence. Here are a few highlights:
The management of a $65-billion government organiza-
• 
tion was consistently given too much data and not enough 
usable information. This happened because no one had 
figured out which data was relevant. Also, when faced 
with legislative mandates, the organization didn’t know 
what the impact would be and where to apply changes. 
Using the Four Transformational Intelligences, this agency 
was able to reduce cost, cater to their internal custom-
ers (marketing, human resources, and finance), gain visual 
insight, and communicate effectively with their employees. 
They also have a process for continuous improvement.
Because of a government mandate, an insurance risk 
• 
management organization needed to merge and consoli-
date processes across multiple departments to respond 
to their customers’ needs. These changes affected many 
internal employees, contractors, and consultants. They 
were experiencing friction, misdirection, and costly 
rework before I became actively involved. After working  
through the Four Transformational Intelligences, there 
was clarity, structure, organization, and collaboration 
across the board.
The CEO of an international software company needed 
• 
to expand business into a new industry. By using the Four 
Transformational Intelligences, the company successfully 
broke into the new niche.
I have applied the Four Transformational Intelligences to a wide variety of 
businesses with a plethora of different needs. Those organizations had and are 
continuing to have tremendous breakthroughs. I’ve had enough success with 
this system to know that it can work for you too. That’s why I’m bringing it 
to you in this book.
Using the Four Transformational Intelligences, you will learn how to declutter, 
simplify, collaborate, communicate, and strategize better. You will change the 
way you look at your processes, patterns, behaviors, and thinking habits so 
that you make better business decisions, where the transformation process 
becomes less painful and more productive.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind

Brain and Mind
The following chapters will delve into each of these Four Transformational 
Intelligences and how to implement them in your organization. First, however, 
it’s important that you understand how the human brain and mind work; how 
we process information, what ignites and triggers our behaviors, and how we 
make decisions. The more you know and understand how you and the people 
within your organization function at the most basic level, the greater insight 
you’ll have as you seek to transform your business.
To many, including scientists and psychologists, the terms brain and mind are 
interchangeable because you can’t have one without the other. In fact, there is no 
single agreed-upon definition of “the mind.” In the context of this book, however, 
I distinguish between the two. The brain is the physical organ, part of the central 
nervous system, situated within the skull. It enables you to have a mind. The 
mind refers to the part of you that is capable of thinking, sensing, and performing 
higher functions such as reason, memory, decision-making, and emotion.
The Executive Functions of the Brain
The sophisticated, complex, and enchanting organ known as the brain weighs 
in at two to three pounds. It gives us boundless potential and grand powers 
because it is what gives us the ability to use our mind.
The two hemispheres of mammalian brains are encased in a thin rind of neural 
tissue called the cerebral cortex. In human beings, most of the cerebral cortex is 
a six-layered structure called the neocortex, which is the most highly developed 
of cerebral tissues and the most recently evolved, hence the prefix “neo.” The 
neocortex is divided into four regions called lobes that are mapped by the 
four largest sutured bones of the cranial vault. Accordingly, the frontal, parietal, 
temporal, and occipital lobes (Figure 1-1) are the regions of your neocortex that 
lie under your frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital skull bones.
The neocortex enables higher functions of conscious thought, sensory insight, 
motor commands, spatial reasoning, and language. It is the part of the brain 
that enables us to predict who we’ll be bumping into at the water cooler, what 
we’ll be hearing at today’s meeting, and how we’ll react to a corporate decision. 
These predictions are based on previously captured data that was absorbed by 
the various senses. For example, pretend you’re at the beach. You feel the cool 
breeze whisk across your face and the sand between your toes as you walk 
along the shore. You hear the cawing of seagulls and the waves crashing against 
the rocks. You see the magnificent sunset and a sailboat heeling into the wind. 
You taste sea salt and smell the freshness of the air. As you continue to walk, 
you feel something between your toes other than sand. It’s solid. Is it a crab or 
a pearl shell? Your neocortex kicks in and makes a prediction while creating a 
memory based on the outcome of your new experience.

Chapter 1 | Your Brain, Mind, and Business Transformation

The four lobes of the neocortex perform different functions (Figure 1-1):
The 
• 
frontal lobe enables cognitive thinking and controls 
functions such as judgment, speech, and reasoning.
The 
• 
parietal lobe controls tactile sensory information and 
spatial relations.
The 
• 
temporal lobe concerns memory, hearing, sequencing, 
and organization.
The 
• 
occipital lobe interprets visual information.

I will focus on the frontal lobe because it is concerned with executing 
certain behaviors that correspond to the core functions of any business 
executive, including decision making, problem solving, planning, creating, 
speculating, learning, concentrating, focusing, awareness, attention, observa-
tion, and consciousness. The frontal lobe is what enables you to hypothesize 
about opportunities; instigate; make conscious decisions; control spontaneous, 
impulsive, and emotional social and sexual behaviors; and learn new things. The 
frontal lobe includes the following subregions, among others:
The 
• 
prefrontal cortex is fundamental to the performance of 
skills that need intelligence. It enables high-level planning.
The 
• 
orbitofrontal cortex is a part of the prefrontal cortex 
that is essential for risk and reward assessment as well as 
moral judgment.
The 
• 
primary motor cortex controls the muscles from the 
spinal cord.
The 
• 
premotor cortex consciously monitors movement 
sequences by using sensory feedback.
Of these several frontal lobe subregions, I will, again, focus on only one—the 
prefrontal cortex.
The prefrontal cortex is located just above your eyes behind your forehead. 
When you focus and concentrate hard, do you automatically rub your fore-
head? You’re not alone. My mother does this all the time while she tries to 
recall something. Then she slaps her forehead when she remembers it!
The prefrontal cortex is what makes primates different from other species 
because it is where deeper or higher thinking occurs. It plays an important 
part in memory, conscious thinking, intellectual thoughts, concentration, 
cognitive analysis, motivation, creativity, emotions, and personality. This brain 
region gives you the capacity to exercise critical thinking and reasoning in 
social situations when presented with difficulty.
The prefrontal cortex—often referred to as the CEO, decision maker, or 
executive center of the brain—takes in information from all of the senses and 
arranges thoughts and actions to achieve specific goals. The main executive 
functions of the prefrontal cortex include the following:
Concentrating
• 
Processing ideas and mental reactions in a way that lets 
• 
you choose what to do next
Predicting possible futures based on your present conduct 
• 
or that of others
Creating approaches ahead of time
• 

Chapter 1 | Your Brain, Mind, and Business Transformation

Making choices that consider both what you want now 
• 
and in the long term
Altering or fine-tuning conduct when circumstances shift
• 
Holding back on urges and waiting to get what you want
• 
Dialing back overly strong feelings
• 
Taking into account a variety of factors at the same time 
• 
while dealing with new, sometimes difficult material
Controlled Consciousness
As you read this book, try to be in a controlled conscious state of mind. 
That is, be fully aware of yourself internally by directing your attention to 
your breathing, your sensations, and your heartbeat, among other things. This 
awareness will result in a form of “deliberate consciousness,” which will alter 
the frequency of your brain waves, taking them from a heightened, intense 
state of alertness.
Uncontrolled consciousness, on the other hand, is activated by fear and anxi-
ety. It can negatively influence both individual and organizational thoughts and 
actions. For example, if a company experiences a crisis like a security data 
breach, employees’ antennas instantly go up but in a chaotic, reactive manner. 
Paranoia and panic combined with feelings of stress, anxiety, and confusion 
make it more difficult to problem solve and make good decisions. These same 
feelings often cloud work performance under any situation.
Let’s do a brief consciousness-raising exercise. What emotions are you feel-
ing right now? How deep is your breathing? How fast is your heart beating? 
Is there chatter going on in your mind? If so, bring your focus back to your 
breathing. Pay attention to the changes in your current emotional state and 
physical well-being. Are you feeling more relaxed? How is your posture? Are 
your breaths becoming stronger and deeper?
As you become aware of your inner self, notice what is happening to your 
body and your mind. As you pass oxygen into your brain, you will notice that 
your attention becomes more focused, which causes you to be more aware. 
This is the state I want you in as you read this book.
The Business Mind
You’ve probably heard someone say, “So-and-so has a real mind for business.” 
Think about what that means. How is a business mind different from a non-
business mind? A business mind doesn’t just do what it is taught and told to 
do. A business mind is an innovative, self-aware mind marked by the syndrome 
of characteristics in Chart 1-1.

Purpose and the Business Mind
You can easily tell when someone has a business mind. Someone who has 
their business mind switched to “on” typically works with passion and 
purpose. They are fully present and love their work. The people they engage 
with experience the full joy that radiates from them. Their ebullient, positive 
energy is captivating. They are finding deep pleasure in their business and life. 
They are in harmony with themselves and their surroundings.
People with a business mind also possess long-term as well as short-term 
vision. They set their goals higher and desire bigger outcomes. Many think that 
bigger outcomes always equate with money, but upon diving deeper, it usually 
turns out this is not the reason.
For example, my personal purpose is to spend quality time with my grandparents 
and mother; to visit my brother when and for how long I desire; to work 
with programs that help support those with mental disabilities and disease; 
to empower future generations; to travel the world; to passionately dance; to 
share smiles and laughter with those who cross my path; to uplift, motivate, 
and inspire many; and to resonate love and compassion.
To fulfill my purpose, I realized I needed money, but I also knew that I needed to 
make some conscious changes. They weren’t easy and didn’t happen overnight, 
but eventually I decluttered and simplified my business. I moved my company 
to the cloud, so I could work where and when I chose.
I now feel more focused and much healthier and happier with where I am in 
my life. I now have more time to do the things I really love to do. I get to help 
people change their lives and businesses. This book, in fact, fulfills part of my 
purpose to make a difference and create new opportunities for others.
Keep in mind that you can have multiple purposes, which can evolve and 
change over time. Just make sure that whatever your purpose is, you are con-
scious of it every day and dedicate at least some of your activities to meeting 
your goals.
Purpose and Your Company’s Mission
Just as an individual needs a purpose, an organization needs one too. Your 
company’s mission statement should reflect its purpose and ideal current 
state. The values of a company are its core principles. The vision statement 
should portray the vision for tomorrow. Can you instantly recall your com-
pany’s mission, values, and vision? If you have to look them up, then you are not 
consciously working in the spirit of your company’s mission.
If you could, would you refine it? If so, what would it be? These are crucial 
questions everyone in your organization must ask themselves to achieve their 
full potential.

As an example, the following are the mission, values, and vision of the US 
Department of Agriculture (USDA):
Mission
We provide leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, 
nutrition, and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available 
science, and efficient management.2
Values
Transparency — Making the Department’s management processes more open so 
that the public can learn how USDA supports Americans every day in every way.
Participation — Providing opportunities for USDA constituents to shape and 
improve services provided by the Department.
Collaboration — Working cooperatively at all governmental levels domesti-
cally and internationally on policy matters affecting a broad audience.
Accountability — Ensuring that the performance of all employees is measured 
against the achievement of the Department’s strategic goals.
Customer Focus — Serving USDA’s constituents by delivering programs that 
address their diverse needs.
Professionalism — Building and maintaining a highly skilled, diverse, and 
compassionate workforce.
Results Orientation — Measuring performance and making management 
decisions to direct resources to where they are used most effectively.3
Vision
To expand economic opportunity through innovation, helping rural America 
to thrive; to promote agriculture production sustainability that better nour-
ishes Americans while also helping feed others throughout the world; and 
to preserve and conserve our Nation's natural resources through restored 
forests, improved watersheds, and healthy private working lands.

The following is the mission statement for Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), 
one of USDA’s subagencies4:
To increase food security and reduce hunger in partnership with cooperating 
organizations by providing children and low income people access to food, a 
healthful diet, and nutrition education in a manner that supports American 
agriculture and inspires public confidence.
An internal USDA department, the Office of Inspector General (OIG), has its 
own mission, values, and vision statement5:
Mission
OIG’s mission is to promote economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and integrity in 
the delivery of USDA’s programs.
Values
We place value on people. We earn and give respect to everyone we encounter 
in our work. We treat our fellow OIG team members as equal partners and 
full contributors to OIG’s mission, vision, and goals.
We place value on making a positive difference through the work we do. We are 
committed to constantly improving how we operate, embracing innovation, 
and using persistence and determination to achieve results.
Vision
OIG will be a trusted contributor to the value, safety, and integrity of USDA 
programs.
The point of showing you these various samples is to illustrate that an organi-
zation can have multiple missions, values, and visions as long as they fulfill the 
same ultimate purpose. This can be accomplished by working with the Four 
Transformational Intelligences.
Likewise, a company’s business goals, objectives, and initiatives should align 
with the company’s mission, values, and vision. The following illustration, in 
Figure 1-2, shows the USDA’s strategic plan for 2010-2015 with results for 
how FNS met one of USDA’s goals in 2013.

Goals are guidelines that lay out what you want to achieve. They are generally 
long-term in nature and usually represent broad visions (such as “safe, nutritious, 
and balanced meals”).
Objectives define strategies or implementation steps to attain the identified 
goals (such as “increase access to nutritious food”). Objectives are specific, 
measurable, and have a defined completion date (“2013” for FNS). They are 
more specific and outline the who, what, when, where, and how of reaching 
the goals.
Initiatives are the tasks or day-to-day activities (such as “strong customer  
service”) that allow the objective to be effective and goals to be accomplished.
Controlled Focus
Your conscious mind, as powerful as it is, can focus on and retain information 
for approximately ten seconds or less. So you must consciously decide where 
you direct your focus. How do you control it? By choice. You choose what to 
focus on. You decide what thoughts and what kind of thinking you allow into 
your mind.
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the conscious mind is the part 
of the brain that performs critical thinking, reasoning, goal setting, and plan-
ning. The subconscious mind, where beliefs, habits, and actions exist, is what 
causes us to execute and take action. If we apply this to a company structure, 
the CEO is the equivalent to the conscious part of the brain. He or she gives 
orders, makes decisions, plans, and directs the company on what to do. The 
executives reporting to the CEO symbolize the subconscious.

For example, if your company has a meeting automatically scheduled every 
week on the same day, at the same time, at the same location, and with 
the same agenda, your staff’s subconscious will kick in and they will go 
on autopilot. The staff begins to predict what will happen in the meeting.  
These predictions are drawn from memory, which is stored in the 
subconscious. The meeting becomes an uncontrolled habit of actions as 
illustrated in Figure 1-3.

Figure 1-3.  CEO of the mind
Let’s say that one day, however, the CEO announces the meeting will be held 
on a bus on a Sunday, not a regular workday. This disorients the minds of the 
team. Their conscious awareness is focused and on full alert because it is no 
longer able to draw from past experience.
The CEO has the control to create new habits, to change the expectations of 
information needed in the meetings, and to shift the mind to form new actions.
The Four Transformational Intelligences  
and Change
What kind of CEO are you? Do you have the will to make something happen 
or do you believe you are powerless over certain situations? Since any type of 
change is hard, strong determination and full consciousness on your part are 
absolutely imperative to succeed.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind

The Four Transformational Intelligences will guide you through change. As 
shown in Figure 1-4, the Four Transformational Intelligences paint a picture of 
how your mindset should be as you start out on your journey.
Financial Intelligence
Reinvest and Regrow how you exceed revenue capacity
Customer Intelligence
Rethink and Redefine how you attract and maintain customers
Data Intelligence
Reinvent and Recreate the way you see, organize, collaborate, and 
interpret information
Mastermind Intelligence
Rewire the way your company communicates, operates, solves 
problems, interacts, creates, and innovates
Figure 1-4. The Four Transformational Intelligences
Chapters 2–5 explore each of the Four Intelligences in turn. Chapters 6 and 
7 show where you can make changes most effectively in your organization 
based on pattern recognition and strategy mapping practices.
The overarching purpose of the processes you will be learning is to help you 
make critical decisions to transform your company and drive value. You need 
to consistently ask yourself two questions:
How confident am I that my organization’s performance 
• 
will improve?
Why should I believe the information I have before me is 
• 
accurate?
Most executives and decision makers struggle to answer these two questions. 
This book provides you with the framework for unlocking the answers to 
them. Once you understand this framework, you will be able to apply it to 
make decisions and take action that will drive transformation and improve 
collaboration and communication across your organization.
My goal is not to give you all the knowledge you will ever need to approach 
change, but rather to open your mind to opportunities, get you excited about 
the possibilities, to have breakthroughs and “a-ha” moments, and to moti-
vate you enough to consistently apply the exercises in this book, so that the 
approach becomes a part of your subconscious.

Chapter 1 | Your Brain, Mind, and Business Transformation
16
The best way to begin to implement the Four Transformational Intelligences 
is to identify a central controlled area within your business that can make an 
impact and cause a ripple effect. For example, the legal department within an 
organization touches all other departments and can serve as a controlled area 
where you could apply a systematic approach.
During this process, I encourage you to make note of where changes can be 
applied specifically to your business. Since your business mind will be turned 
on, focused, and consciously aware, use a journal, notepad, smartphone, or 
tablet to jot down your thoughts as you go.
Once you understand how to implement the Four Transformational 
Intelligences, you will gain clarity and confidence. After you internalize the 
framework, you will easily and intuitively be able to apply this newfound lens 
to meet unforeseen changes and changing business environments proactively, 
strategically, and with a sense of purpose.
And now, on to change.

Reinvest in Yourself and Your Business
The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas 
in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.
— F. Scott Fitzgerald
Financial Intelligence, which I also call Financial Transformational Intelligence, uti-
lizes special strategies and certain aspects of brain biology to optimize the 
insights you generate while looking at your organization’s financial data. This 
approach, which also quiets the unconscious patterns of thinking that keep 
you from seeing as clearly as possible, helps you see new opportunities, which 
lead to new decisions. You can then create new initiatives that align with your 
organization’s mission, strategic goals, and objectives.
Neuroeconomics
Our brains are wired with certain circuits and chemical reactions that are 
based on how we capture and process information. Each time we are faced 
with triggers such as stress or pressure, our brain releases chemicals and 
refers to known pathways in order to make a decision. Do I save or spend? 
Should I invest or sell? If I give, will I gain anything in return?

Chapter 2 | Financial Intelligence

Most business people act based on automatic, chemical reactions that keep 
them from responding to the information they have with a clear perspective. 
It’s as if their brain’s software is making rote, habitual decisions for them. But 
if you understand how the software works, you can reprogram it to see the 
bigger picture.
There is a whole new field of study based on the advances made in under-
standing what happens in the brain when humans make business decisions. 
It’s called neuroeconomics, and it has become important in the last decade. 
Degrees in neuroeconomics are now offered by universities that include 
MIT, Harvard, Yale, Carnegie Mellon, Princeton, and George Mason. To under-
stand the breadth of this subject, all you have to do is look at a description 
of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies (CNS) at Claremont Graduate 
University, which says that researchers “draw on economic theory, experi-
mental economics, neuroscience, endocrinology, and psychology to develop a 
comprehensive understanding of human decisions.”1
Trust, Fear, and Reward
Let’s start by focusing on three emotional responses—trust, fear, and reward. 
When these responses are encountered during business activities, they trig-
ger an associated neurological action in executives and decision makers.
Trust
Trust comes in different forms. Perhaps you trust in the data you have in front 
of you. Maybe you trust in the people who provided you with that information. 
Hopefully, you trust in yourself to make correct and impactful decisions.
What is your experience with trust? Do you trust until proven wrong or do 
you question until trust is gained? What is your comfort level when it comes 
to trust?
The next time you are handed a report, examine your reaction to the trust 
you have in that report—including both the data and the human interaction 
aspects of your reaction. How much do you “love” the report?
According to Dr. Paul J. Zak, founding director of CNS, love is the foundation 
of trust. But what does love have to do with economics and financial decisions, 
let alone a report?

If you like investing, you probably follow an analyst that you trust in the  
market. Maybe you read his blogs, pay attention to their latest trending thoughts 
on Twitter, and even follow the influencers who they follow. Focus and think 
about this person for a few seconds. If you really can’t think of an analyst, try 
picturing a coach, mentor, public figure, or even a celebrity who inspires you. 
Would you trust him enough to give him your money to invest with? Why do 
you feel connected to them? Did one of your friends or colleagues influence 
you to feel positively about this individual?
When you relate to a person, event, or even a piece of writing, you tend to feel 
safe and connected, which creates a feeling of trust. Trust triggers the release 
of oxytocin, commonly known as the “love hormone.” Oxytocin is released 
during childbirth, breastfeeding, and orgasms, as well as from the social bond 
humans have with other humans. Oxytocin is produced in the hypothalamus 
of the brain, as shown in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1.  Location of the hypothalamus, where oxytocin is produced2
So how does this relate to neuroeconomics and business decisions? When 
we decide to trust someone or something, the bonding feeling we experience 
in the present is based on an association with a positive experience in our 
past, whether we consciously remember it or not. Often, due to information 
overload or pressure to make judgments too quickly, we make instant deci-
sions based on trust, instinct, and a feeling of comfort, rather than through 
analysis of the issue in a stand-alone way. A thorough analysis will lead to 
better decisions.

Fear
In business, we need to plan for potential losses and manage risks. These risks 
can be related to finance, security, legal issues, and data. Just reading the word 
“risk” can alter your thoughts and emotions, raise your pulse, and speed up 
your breathing. If that happened to you just now, it was because your brain 
was processing fear, worry, and uncertainty.
Risk is the potential to lose something when trying to gain something. Our 
reaction to loss is different than it is with risk. Loss is something you had that 
you are not able to recover.
Have you ever owned something that you took a huge loss on—either real 
estate, stocks, or something of sentimental value (an art collection) that broke 
or tore? Was it hard to let go? Did you hold onto it because you thought that 
the price might jump back up? Maybe you stored it away in the closet to fig-
ure out a way to repair it later. How did your pride and ego factor into your 
course of action? More than likely you spent time and money taking more 
risks trying to recover what you lost.
Generally, humans hate to lose, so when we suffer a loss, we sometimes take 
risks on top of risks in the hopes of recovering. This is usually a bad idea.
A major influence when it comes to risk and reward is “risk aversion.”3 For 
example, imagine you’re a business owner and a situation arises where you 
have no choice but to choose another company to partner with. Company 
A has a guaranteed contract with a client valued at $1M. Company B has a 
50% chance of closing with a $10M contract. Which do you choose? Even 
though Company A has a lower expected value, most decision makers prefer a  
guarantee. Would your decision change if the guaranteed contract from 
Company A was $500K instead of $1M?
Risk aversion is where decision makers give up expected value for a higher 
degree of certainty, even with a lower payoff. However, because of other non-
monetary related factors—such as Company B’s visibility in the market or 
Company B being known as a company that’s easy to do business with—your 
decision might be based on expected utility instead of expected income.
Pay attention to what stimulates you to make certain choices in business 
when it comes to risk.
If the scenario is reversed from potential profit to potential loss, where 
Company A has a guaranteed loss of $1M vs. Company B’s 50% chance of a 
$10M loss, what partnership would you decide to take? Most would choose

Decision Making Under Certainty.” Nature Neuroscience, April 2008; 11(4): 398–403,

Company B because there is a possibility, not a guarantee, that you won’t lose 
anything even though the monetary value of loss could potentially be higher. 
This is known as “loss aversion,” a term first coined by Daniel Kahneman and 
Amos Tversky.4
The adverse feelings that result from a definite loss can be deeper than the 
feelings from an uncertain risk. Typically the feeling that appears is fear or stress. 
In many cases, they’re actually the same thing. Stress is often simply a milder 
form of fear. You experience stress because you are afraid that the outcome of 
a situation won’t be optimal or you’re afraid you won’t get your needs met.
Fear of loss or risk releases chemicals and adrenaline to the body causing 
harmful results, mostly health issues. The signals that are sent to the brain 
cause one of three reactions: a flight, fight, or freeze response. During different 
situations of fear, one is more dominant than the other.
Think about investing in a new program within your company. It could be 
cloud computing, big data analytics, mergers and acquisitions, or any other big 
ticket item. At this point in time, if you’re feeling fear, you are unconsciously 
re-imagining disasters from your past. We have all had disastrous moments. 
Maybe the projects were under-budgeted or required lots of rework due to 
failure. Maybe because of the failure, you disappointed stakeholders, custom-
ers, or partners. Whatever it was, you are unconsciously linking the present 
situation to that one.
Focus on your various fearful thoughts. What is your typical initial response 
when it comes to those frightening times? Typically it comes down to one of 
these three items:
“Nothing is ever going to be the same. How do I face 
• 
people?” - Flight response
“Who is responsible for this mess?” - Fight response
• 
“I don’t know what to do to get out of this mess.” - 
• 
Freeze response
In business, your reaction to fear might be different than in your personal life. For 
example, stressful business meetings cause my mind to react with a fight response. 
No, I don’t jump across the table and strangle someone. Instead my mind starts 
to work like a puzzle to figure things out—fighting back with the stress.
However, in my romantic life, I used to be a runner. I wouldn’t make it to the 
second date—usually fleeing, hiding, or running away. I feared something that 
hadn’t even happened yet. Since I began the process of paying attention to

Vol 39(4), April 1984; 39(4): 341–350, http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.39.4.341 .

myself, I know how my mind works and I can ignore the initial fear and its 
automatic impulse to flee. I am in control of my mind. I have the power to 
decide what messages to send off in my brain.
When it comes to fear, your brain releases chemical messengers that influence 
your behavior. When you become conscious of these signals, you can alter 
behaviors and react differently to events. Fear is neither positive nor negative. 
Within the brain, the region responsible for fear and aggressive behavior is 
called the amygdala.5 The amygdala reaches into the memory and retrieves 
warning signs related to fear—Caution! Careful! Danger! Fear can protect 
you by signaling to your brain about events such as the following:
oncoming car - caution
• 
hot stove - careful
• 
shark in the water – there’s danger
• 
Recognize the types of fear messages that your body sends. Pay attention 
to your own mind. Your mind can be trained to overcome almost any fear, 
whether it is related to money, food, failure, relationships, or even flying.
The amygdala, shown in Figure 2-2, is the part of the brain that deals with 
emotions, learning, and memories relating to fear. Fear causes your mind to 
predict outcomes that have not occurred yet based on memories and emo-
tions from the past. You can train your mind to learn to refocus on the posi-
tive, rewarding outcome that fear can bring instead of the negative.

As mentioned in Chapter 1, the prefrontal cortex of our brain, (responsible 
for decision-making, problem-solving, and judgment), has the ability to plan 
the course of actions based on signals received from the amygdala. In other 
words, after the initial emotional reaction of fear coming from the amygdala, 
the prefrontal cortex decides what reaction and course of action to take to 
get out of the fearful, stress-producing event. It is the prefrontal cortex that 
allows you to decide to take conscious control of your anxieties.
You have the power to alter your fear with reward.
Reward
Reward-seeking is different in males than in females. The male neurobiological 
behavior patterns find competition and conflict rewarding. I once had dinner 
with an executive who was highly competitive, a sign of high testosterone lev-
els. How did I realize he was so competitive? He kept mentioning the year-to-
date billion dollar revenue he had brought into his company. At first I thought 
he was trusting me by sharing with me his pride in how hard his department 
was working. Then he went on and on about how he figured out a way to 
gain and lead the market while throwing other guys under the bus. When I 
presented him with the idea of helping society by offering services and educa-
tion to uplift his customers’ businesses—in other words, creating a “win-win” 
solution, he was not interested. His interest was self-centered—winning over 
competition and playing the power game.
Dr. Zak has further proven that higher levels of testosterone decreases finan-
cial and nonfinancial generosity. Generosity is driven by feelings of trust and 
empathy. Therefore, those with high levels of testosterone (“alpha males”) are 
distrusting and uncompassionate. These alpha males demand generosity from 
others. 
On the other hand, the female brain, which produces estrogen, rewards the 
seeking of social connection. As a response to fear-based events such as con-
flict, the female brain searches for solutions. These solutions involve compro-
mise, even if it results in letting go of something of importance. Searching for a 
solution involving social interaction triggers trust, which, as mentioned above, 
produces oxytocin. This “tend-and-befriend” process that is dominantly found 
in female brain patterns is rewarding.7

Seeking in the Balloon Analogue Risk Task.” (2009), PLoS ONE 4(7): e6002 (2009). doi:

We see an increase in the number of women in executive leadership roles 
year after year. Business models have changed; there is a desire for more 
engagement, collaboration, social activities, and interaction internally as well as 
with customers and partners. The female brain naturally possesses the charac-
teristics that create the values to which many companies aspire.
Male and female bonding in the workplace has allowed the two to learn from 
each other. In recent years, both males and females have demonstrated signs 
of compassion in the workplace. This not only benefits their organization but 
society as well.
Leaders also promote, encourage, and reward employees and partners to 
contribute by mentoring, volunteering, and donating. These “giving” types of 
activities present rewarding empathic emotional feelings for both the giver and 
the receiver. The feeling of trust itself is rewarding. The tendency to reward 
a feeling of trust kicks in when the trusting behavior is positively reinforced. 
For example, when you trust a charity enough to donate to it and then you 
receive evidence of positive results, you feel rewarded. 
Connecting with others through trusting interactions creates oxytocin in the 
brain, which reduces stress and calms the mind. But what gets the mind moti-
vated, excited, and stimulated? The subconscious mind is continually seeking 
pleasure and anticipating reward, regardless of whether that reward is for the 
short or long term. Some rewards found through research include food, water, 
sex, money, and drugs.
The motivation that occurs is not about the actual attainment of the reward, 
but the probability of achieving it. This seeking behavior of the mind releases 
a neurotransmitter called dopamine in the brain. When there is a challenging 
goal that you expect to achieve, a surge of dopamine is released, which moti-
vates you with a sense of pleasure. This focus on the anticipated reward, as 
opposed to fear, is what creates the business mind.
Males and females generally tackle the challenge differently, with males work-
ing independently and females working collaboratively.
One of the most important tools you can use to access your business mind, 
as well as the business mind of everyone else you deal with, is to focus on the 
reward. Create “win-win” solutions for your company, customers, and part-
ners. Think of scenarios that will help your mind connect to reward. When 
you can train your mind to seek rewarding responses instead of fear, the brain 
releases “feel good” hormones instead of stressful ones.
Remember, the thought of fearful events is a negative prediction about the 
future. Do you want to dread fear or anticipate reward? It is your choice. The 
business mind will pick the reward. Distant rewards still trigger reward signals 
in your brain and a sense of contentment even if you know that the reward is 
long term. That is why a business mind aligns its financial goals to reward, and 
this is how Financial Intelligence blossoms. 

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind

Financial Intelligence
Don‘t think that Financial Intelligence only involves the chief financial  
officer (CFO), the finance department, or the financial lead within a nonfinance 
department. Financial Intelligence is for those involved with the organization’s 
strategic goals, objectives, and initiatives. This should mean everyone.
Your task is to measure financial success—the impact a proposed activity 
will have on the company’s performance by mapping and wiring your busi-
ness mind to the strategic objective at hand. These objectives can include the 
following:
Decreasing cost
• 
Increasing quality
• 
Increasing productivity
• 
Mergers and acquisitions
• 
Increasing growth (revenue, profits)
• 
Return on investments (ROI)
• 
Adding market share
• 
Optimizing cash flow
• 
Increasing profitability
• 
You define the success.
You also define the reward. Reward is personal. It must have that “feel good” 
emotion attached. Remember, an anticipated reward motivates, excites, and 
stimulates an individual.
Not everyone views rewards in the same way. Maybe you want a yacht, a sec-
ond home in a foreign country, or vacation time to spend with your family. You 
get to define what is rewarding for you. Here are some examples of different 
types of financial rewards:
Bonuses
• 
Incentives
• 
Promotions
• 
Paid time off
• 
Paid vacations
• 
Supporting causes
• 
Additional benefits
• 

Chapter 2 | Financial Intelligence
26
Recognitions and awards
• 
Living a healthy lifestyle
• 
Achieving your personal purpose
• 
Meeting the mission of the company  
• 
Financial Intelligence allows you to be consciously aware of the automatic 
analytical and intuitive processes of the brain, so you can train your mind 
to get out of your own way. It lets you override those processes that nega-
tively affect performance while you focus on those that enhance it. Financial 
Intelligence combines analytics and intuition, where intuition is the awareness 
of the emotional feeling and brain activities that occur when evaluating the 
analytics. This results in intelligent decisions.
It is important with Financial Intelligence, as it is with all the other Intelligences, 
to collaborate and communicate. Input from other team members and depart-
ments is crucial and invaluable. The marketing department will have insight that 
the IT department might not have considered. That insight might trigger an 
issue that HR and legal need to address. For example, if the marketing depart-
ment needs the IT department’s help to track the correlation of employee 
and customer “likes” on social media, both the HR and legal department might 
wave a red flag about potential privacy law issues.
Let’s pretend you’re looking to reduce IT cost. Are you communicating and 
using your business mind to understand the other departments? What about 
understanding your IT support center? What are the types of incidents they 
are receiving? Is it a user training issue? Or are they supporting too many user 
products? Or are the version releases for each user too overwhelming to be 
supported?
There are many ways you can simultaneously work toward your company’s 
mission while seeking financial success and personal reward. Just look at the 
big business picture. Take into account the many factors that can and are 
impacting your business. These factors include the economy, legislative man-
dates and regulations, customer and partner needs, technology implementa-
tions, and of course your competition.
Next, we’ll look at a few subcategories of Financial Intelligence: Predictive 
Intelligence, Risk Intelligence, and Business Intelligence.
Predictive Intelligence
The CFO of an organization needs to think about future investments. These 
investments could be in new tools, mergers and acquisitions, or employee pro-
ductivity programs. At the same time, the CFO needs to evaluate the entire 
company’s financial performance.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
27
To predict future financial performance, a CFO needs to forecast trends based 
on the company’s historical activity. The CFO requires financial analytics to 
drill down into the relationship of cause and effect to understand why inci-
dents occur.
How can CFOs sift through enormous amounts of financial data, extract use-
ful ones, and interpret the information to make actionable changes that make 
an impact? The answer is Predictive Intelligence.
Predictive Intelligence is based on historical data and projections about the 
market. It is mostly about estimates and assumptions. When you are present-
ing numbers about a potential idea to an executive, guess what? They are 
based on estimates and assumptions.
A lack of collaboration or insight into other departments within an organiza-
tion often leads to the omission of certain useful financial numbers. These 
numbers are important when executives need to make decisions based on the 
overall health of the company.
For example, let’s take marketing and outreach activities. The investments 
made in these areas, like all other investments, are based on estimates and 
assumptions of how much our company will benefit based on these initiatives. 
We assume data from the past will help us with our prediction about the 
future. There’s no guarantee, however, of that being true. 
Risk Intelligence
Measuring risk is about making predictions. As we noted, Predictive Intelligence 
makes estimates and assumptions based on historical data and/or experience. 
With Risk Intelligence, we are making estimates and assumptions about the 
risk of a future event. It is about understanding the amount of risk you and 
your organization are willing to take.
Earlier we uncovered risk aversion, which has to do with influential decisions 
about risks and rewards. Here we dive a bit deeper for you to get comfort-
able with risk. Risk Intelligence is about understanding when you start to get 
uncomfortable. Then you trust in your own discomfort to make innovative 
judgment calls. The idea is to determine a risk range that you can effectively 
tolerate and control.
You might have different comfort ranges for different types of risk. If you are 
running an international company, then you might have different risk toler-
ance for legislative mandates and regulations according to policies in different 
countries.
How much risk are you willing to bear and take? What is your attitude toward 
risk? What about non-monetary types of risk such as reputation?

Chapter 2 | Financial Intelligence
28
Risks with a potential reward give the decision maker a greater appetite—
unrewarded risks reduce the appetite for risk.
Keep in mind that circumstances will continually change and so will oppor-
tunities; therefore, you will need to readjust your risk range on a regular 
basis. How is risk viewed within your organization? Are you encouraging Risk 
Intelligence discussions to occur? Be honest and realistic with yourself and 
others in your business. Allow them to share their thoughts on risk. A true 
business mind seeks input from others. Understand their risk tolerance and 
how it stacks up to yours. You will need their buy-in for any strategy or action 
you take to be successful.
Business Intelligence
Within the industry, Business Intelligence has come to be known as a type 
of reporting tool. Here I refer to Business Intelligence as a transformational 
mindset, where you look from the outside in to see your business, from high 
up in the sky. Look at the good and bad, positive and negative impacts, internal 
and external concerns—I mean all of it. The Business Intelligence mindset is 
about asking “How do my initiatives support overall strategy?” when weighing 
future measures.
For example, if your company is running on an accrual basis of accounting,  
revenue is recorded when the transaction is completed. It is not when you receive 
final payment, but when the “consider it done” is actually accomplished.
Let’s pretend you were part of a software company that ran on an accrual 
basis several years ago. Back then, software was shipped with separate key 
codes. Sometimes it would take two weeks just to deliver the package, so 
it took two weeks after a sale for revenue to be recordable. However, using 
your Business Intelligence and collaborating with your internal employees and 
external partners, you pushed yourself out of your comfort zone to deliver 
software instantaneously over the Internet.
A decision like this allowed your company to record revenue faster and more 
efficiently. You also saved money on tracking, manufacturing, and quality con-
trol. Additional savings were passed on to your distributors and resellers. 
Customers loved you because they could get their software right away. Heck, 
you even helped the environment.
You became a hero in your company and a star in your industry, just by moving 
out of your comfort zone of doing things the way they were usually done.
Sounds great, right?
Okay, I know. You weren’t the one who invented instant downloadable soft-
ware. But it happened to somebody. You would have needed to use the prin-
ciples of Financial Intelligence to pull off such a massive change. There would 

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
29
have been a lot of Risk Intelligence required to estimate the costs and risks 
involved—and some courage—and perhaps a mastery of some risk aversion 
to pull this particular trigger.
If you follow the Financial Intelligence model with your business, you could be 
the next hero or heroine.
Now let’s look at an issue from today’s world—the issue of maintenance that 
is offered with yearly IT support services. In the realm of accrual accounting, 
those one-year support services have not been “delivered” yet. If it takes a 
full year before they are considered “delivered,” how are they accounted for? 
(For professional services, the work must be completed before the revenue 
from it can be recognized.)
Different business models recognize earned revenue differently.
Now that cloud computing allows for month-to-month pricing models, how is 
that revenue entered into the accounting system? What financial adjustments 
need to be made—pertaining not only to the booking of the sale, but also to 
other relevant internal and external processes, customers, distributors, resell-
ers, and partners offering complementary services. Many cloud computing 
business models are able to record offerings as unearned income due to the 
prepaid quarterly or yearly pricing models, which allows for working capital. 
This is a completely different way of looking at the same accounting issue.
My goal here is not to provide accounting advice, but to help you stay alert 
to the possibility of constant improvement to financial success by using your 
Business Intelligence mindset. Using that mindset, you have the potential to 
alter your business model and improve your organization’s finances.
We all know that there are certain kinds of financial risks that need to be 
justified, whatever your business model. However, financial and accounting 
professionals should not be the only ones making financial decisions for the 
company. Collaborative involvement of executives and other company deci-
sion makers is crucial in order to adopt a Business Intelligence mindset and 
shift the business model. 
Don’t be afraid to evolve. Sometimes you have to create new business models. 
And guess what? Successful businesses can’t survive using the same routine. 
Why? Factors surrounding them are in constant motion. Imagine waking up 
every day and everything is exactly the same. The days repeat themselves, over 
and over. How boring! Instead of dreading change, invite it in. Embrace com-
petition. Anticipate unexpected rewards. Some amazing things might actually 
happen. You might not only shift your company into something new and excit-
ing, but create a positive and rewarding movement in society.

Re-Purpose
Often an executive needs to give new meaning and life to a business. It could 
be because of flat or decreasing profits or new competition, or because the 
market has changed somehow. Re-purposing comes in the form of new activi-
ties in business areas like marketing or research and development. The execu-
tive may also explore new industry innovations or establish new employee 
programs that will help ensure the survival of the business.
A recent example of re-purposing comes from the public sector. Mr. Curtis 
(Curt) L. Coy, Deputy Under Secretary for Economic Opportunity for the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), was recently challenged to re-purpose 
his department when the Veterans Retraining Assistance Program (VRAP) act 
went into effect.8
On November 21, 2011, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building South 
Court Auditorium, US President Barack Obama signed the VOW to Hire 
Heroes Act.9 This bipartisan bill passed by Congress provides tax benefits to 
businesses that not only hire veterans, but also provide them with education 
and training opportunities. Within the act, a new law offers unemployed veter-
ans up to 12 months of training assistance.
Mr. Coy, a disabled veteran, was responsible for vocational rehabilitation and 
employment within the department. He was given no additional funds or 
resources to create this new training program, which needed to be in place 
within seven and a half months from the date the president signed the bill.
The new training program, slated to begin on July 1, 2012, was designed for 
unemployed veterans between the ages of 35 and 60 who had no education 
benefits. The program was to accept 99,000 applications until September 30, 
2013. “If you stand back and look at the Department of Labor, Bureau of 
Labor Statistics’ data, there are about 800,000 unemployed veterans. About 
half of them are between the ages of 35 to 60,” said Coy, “. . . we needed to . . 
. convince 99,000 of them, or 25%, to attend school full-time for a year to use 
these benefits.”
Mr. Coy was now faced with operational and marketing issues to solve. The 
first was “putting together the program, in other words, how do you accept 
the applications, how do you review them, how do you notify the veteran, 
how do you start paying the benefits, and so on.” The second was setting up 
the outreach. “You can do this whole process piece,” he said, “and if nobody 
applies [to the program] then the process piece doesn’t work.”

Mr. Coy, like many other executives working in complex enterprise environ-
ments, was tasked with reinvesting in and regrowing his business. When an 
existing business adopts a new program initiative, executives need to stra-
tegically and tactically plan. The plan could include reallocation of resources, 
repositioning of funds, or evaluating and altering schedules (or other criteria) 
of current programs already in place. This activity is the re-purposing we’ve 
been discussing in this chapter.
Mr. Coy had to re-purpose with no additional funds and approximately 20,000 
existing staff members by applying a Financial Intelligence business mind and 
focusing on the reward the program’s outcome would generate.
“One of the good things about working at the Department of VA is that 
almost all its employees are really focused on knowing what the prime mission 
is—and that is to take care of veterans. They consider it an honor and privi-
lege to do that. Sure you might get some folks with the initial eyeball rolls of 
‘we have more to do’—but they know what the end purpose and goal is and, 
as a result, they say, ‘Thank you very much for this additional work.’”
That’s what happens when you re-purpose. Everyone comes together to make 
a big change work.
Lather, Rinse, Repeat
Start small and make big impacts. Break it up into iterative cycles. You’ll be 
doing this process over and over again, each time starting from a fresh place. 
You can also start the process from the viewpoint of different departments.
To stimulate your mind, focus on the rewards that are important to you and also 
to your colleagues, your team, your society, and especially your customers.
Financial Intelligence is deeply connected to your customers and their desires and 
values—which is what the next chapter on Customer Intelligence is all about.

Customer 
Intelligence
Redefine Your Business
All intelligent thoughts have already been thought; what is necessary is 
only to try to think them again.
— Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
Who are your customers? What are ways to attract them? When are you 
able to make that connection with them? Where can you find them? How do 
you reach them?
Answering these questions is the first part of Customer Intelligence. The 
second part of it deals with making sure all the departments within your 
organization share the same definition of their ideal customer. We’ll get to 
that later in the chapter.
First, let’s look at the latest brain-related marketing science that can help you 
attract new customers.
Neuromarketing
What part of the brain lights up when a customer decides, “Yes! I am 
buying that?” In recent years, neuroscientists have been studying consumers 
to determine how their brain reacts to different marketing activities,

such as the package appeal,1 product smell, influence of taste,2 or response to 
advertisements. The practical application of neuroscientists’ marketing research 
is called neuromarketing. There have been fascinating neuromarketing studies 
done around branding, lead generation, and selling.
The neuromarketing topics that are the most germane to Customer 
Intelligence are these two:
What attracts customers?
• 
Why do customers come back for more?
• 
Instant vs. Delayed Gratification for Customers
The thing that draws your customers in is the same thing that draws you in 
as a consumer: reward. As we learned in the last chapter, seeking rewards is 
what motivates, excites, and stimulates us.
But which is better: short-term rewards or long-term ones?
Studies have shown that customers seek instant gratification over delayed 
rewards.3
Not so long ago, we would patiently wait for reward certificates to come in 
the mail after spending the requisite amount at stores like DSW, Pier 1, and 
others. This is an example of delayed rewards.
Then, some retailers had the bright idea to offer instant in-store rewards 
without making us wait for them in the mail. Now we expect that from other 
stores and are disappointed when they can’t satisfy our need for instant 
gratification.
Incentivizing Business Partners
But what about our business partners? Do we try to understand and treat 
partners the same way we do our customers? After all, aren’t our partners a

second-tier connection to our customers? They have the relationship and 
access we need. How are we rewarding our partners? Are we offering them 
instant or delayed gratification?
You depend on your partners to be your extra feet on the street, promoting 
and selling your brand, with high expectations to deliver. But are you rewarding  
them with instant or delayed gratification? Do you take into account their 
own cost of resources—employees, sales documentation, proposals—when 
compensating them? In essence, are you attracting or driving them away?
I am often asked, “What drives partners away?”
Here is a perfect example. Consider the payment terms you may have with 
a partner. Are they favorable, or is your partner often not paid until 60 days 
after the end of a specific quarter? Depending on many factors, it could take a 
few months before payment is received. This can be demotivating.
If partners don’t see or feel instant satisfaction, then they may become 
disincentivized to work as hard as they can for your business. This might 
be their attitude: “If it comes, it comes. Why chase opportunities? I’ll look 
for another partner.” Companies will often spend a great deal of time and 
money to attract partners, but then lose them in the day-to-day interactions. 
Partners, like customers, seek immediate rewards.4 They won’t remain inter-
ested in the opportunity to work with you for long if all you offer them are 
the promise of rewards that take place in the future.
However, businesses need to be savvy in assessing their partners’ satisfaction 
level. Satisfied partners, as well as customers, may be more likely to wait for 
a delayed reward if its value is significantly higher than the instant reward 
they crave.5
On the other hand, dissatisfied customers and partners prefer immediate 
results. Because of this, businesses need to come up with a middle ground 
to please both satisfied and dissatisfied partners. The idea is to offer both a 
small instant reward and a delayed one of higher value. One example of this is 
how students view the experience of obtaining a master’s degree. There are 
smaller immediate rewards, such as positive feedback on papers and semester 
grades. The conferral of the actual degree represents the delayed reward that 
offers higher value satisfaction.

Depending on your industry and business model, partnership agreements can 
satisfy both instant and delayed rewards. Here are two possible examples:
Offer a partner a small sign-on advance, followed by a higher, 
• 
delayed royalty later on. This is similar to the arrangement 
that record companies use with their artists.
Provide a small instant setup fee with a long-term greater 
• 
margin value, which is often how product distribution 
agreements work.
There are pros and cons that should be carefully evaluated with every reward, 
whether it’s instant or delayed. If you have a business model where partners 
compete against each other, be cautious about your setup. A manufacturer 
offering additional incentives (rebates or prizes) to the winning team may 
be incentivizing the wrong thing. These additional incentives might be more 
appealing, even though there is a delayed gratification. One of the partners 
might practically give away the sale to gain the additional incentives, which may 
have a negative effect on the perceived value of your product.
Then there are those who thrive on competition, who have a blood thirst 
for winning. They may defer immediate rewards in anticipation of the higher-
valued delayed gratification. The planning and effort that go into winning the 
competition serves as their immediate reward—and it means more to them 
than any other short-term incentive you could offer.
Having a cut-throat competitor with tremendous drive who takes an instant 
lead in your competition can be a detriment to your remaining partners. The 
losing teams may lose interest because they won’t be getting a long-term  
reward. This behavior will eventually put a dent in the cost of doing busi-
ness with the competing partners who lose. They will look to do business 
with someone who will guarantee them rewards (instant and/or delayed). 
Table 3-1 demonstrates that in this scenario the losing partners not only 
lost an immediate reward, but lost a delayed one as well.

It is amazing how many times business decision makers think of opportunities 
to engage partners, spend lots of money to attract them, and then question 
why partners are not doing business with them anymore. A well thought-out 
intelligence plan was not applied.
Just as some partners may decide it is not worthwhile to do business with 
you, you may also decide that it’s time to abandon certain partners. Business 
partners can impact your business positively or negatively and can affect 
everything from your bottom line to your reputation. As such, you must 
constantly evaluate the state of your partner relationships.
I once had an executive of a major corporation tell me I would go bankrupt 
if I partnered with his company. Apparently, he didn’t want to change his 
business model to conform to the needs of his partners. He did me a huge 
favor by being candid, because he had a point. He was not the kind of execu-
tive I wanted to do business with. If his company was in a position to have a 
partner go bankrupt, then his company had an issue that he should have done 
something about.
Partners are not the only ones you may need to step away from. Evaluate your 
customers. Is it rewarding to do business with them? What kind of reward are 
you seeking—instant, delayed, or both? Just like service companies go through 
a bid/no-bid evaluation process to decide if they will pursue an opportunity, 
so should you.
On a grander scale, let’s look at the business of contracting for the govern-
ment. Many businesses are hesitant to get involved with the government even 
on a small scale. Why is that?
Once again, it comes down to rewards. Doing business with the government 
doesn’t produce an immediate reward. It results in a high-value, delayed 
gratification, which many businesses find risky. The reward is great, but it will 
be received in the distant future.
As a business owner who does business with the government, let me give you 
an example of what it’s like. After a series of meetings, phone calls, and e-mails 
with a particular department or agency, your team devises a viable solution 
for the issue at hand, then works extensively on an exhaustive and lengthy 
proposal. After months of anticipation, you hear back from the contracting 
officer who begins the negotiation process. You then negotiate the work, 
deliverables, and inevitably are asked to lower your costs from the already  
discounted price you initially submitted. The negotiations may go on for 
months, sometimes more than half a year.
Then you win the contract. Yay! It’s time to celebrate. But then nothing 
happens. After weeks and weeks of follow-up, you are told that the actual 
project has stalled and will not start for another few months. Thus, you 
must continue paying for the staff that you have been keeping available since 

Chapter 3 | Customer Intelligence
38
the proposal submission, since they are necessary to deliver the promised 
work. Oh, and don’t forget the interest on the bank loan you took to fund 
your employees until you are able to finally send an invoice. Plus, the govern-
ment department you are working for may not pay on time, postponing the 
reward even further. The longest I’ve waited was 11 months—what a delayed 
gratification!
Don’t let me scare you; there are many benefits to doing business with the 
government, but it is not for everyone. You have to be willing to risk the long 
overdue, but high-value, gratification.
The way you attract customers and partners must also be attractive to you. 
The reward goes both ways. If doing business with a customer is not rewarding 
you, then you will most likely discover that you are not meeting the financial 
success targets you have set for yourself and your business.
Customer Intelligence
The first step in Customer Intelligence is to develop a clear image—for your-
self and your organization—as to who your customers are. The first question 
to ask yourself is “Who is your ideal customer?” To make it easier to put 
together a composite visual image of just whom you are selling to, here is a 
group of questions that will help you come up with that answer:
How old are they?
• 
What are their hobbies?
• 
What sports interest them?
• 
What’s their favorite TV show/movie?
• 
What industries are they in?
• 
What departments do they fall under?
• 
What are their job functions and responsibilities?
• 
Are they members of trade associations? Which ones?
• 
What is their education level?
• 
Who are they partnered with professionally?
• 
What trade or industry magazines do they read?
• 
What general interest magazines, blogs, and web sites do 
• 
they read?
What are their favorite products?
• 

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
39
What types of services do they believe in?
• 
Whom do they follow or admire on social networks like 
• 
Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook?
What charities do they support?
• 
It is important to go through this exercise. Before developing these questions, 
I believed the whole process was rather tedious and a waste of my time. 
Contrary to my initial thought, I find that it helps me tune in, focus, and bring 
clarity about who I am serving and how to market to them.
Janet Wood, Executive Vice President of Talent and Leadership at SAP, created 
a version of her ideal customer and found it extremely valuable. She did this 
through a workshop offered by Design Thinking, from the Design School at 
Stanford University. She says, “The one that I was in, a two-day workshop, 
really focused on attracting and developing talent in SAP. It really changed the 
game and what we’ve been trying to do…. Our customers were really our 
employees and potential employees. You create personas.... You literally go 
to the point of saying, ‘Okay, this persona, her name is Susan, she lives in San 
Francisco and she just graduated with a BS degree in computer science. She’s 
got a boyfriend. She’s working as a waitress during the summer, and she is 
trying to decide on x.’ You go on to create this whole ideal construct.”6
Wood’s goal was to figure out how SAP could be the most attractive to their 
ideal candidates—the best new graduates in the job market. The trick was, 
just as it is in Customer Intelligence, to put herself in the mindset of her ideal 
customer.
“If Susan’s working for the summer as a waitress because she’s not sure what 
she wants to do, what would appeal to Susan? She wants to change the world. 
She’s very involved in volunteering, and so on. It’s really interesting. At the end 
you’re always thinking back to what does this mean? How does this look to 
Susan? It sounds pretty straightforward, but it’s very, very powerful.”
SAP found this exercise so useful that they began to do it with their custom-
ers, to help them figure out how to maximize their opportunities with the 
people they are either currently selling to or the people they want to sell to. 
“It really gets them thinking about their products and their services and the 
customer experience in a way that they may not have before, because all of us, 
even our customers, can get very internally focused,” she says.

Start a Customer Intelligence Group
Of course, this exercise won’t work if you’re the only one who knows the 
answers to these questions. So set up a meeting and perform this exercise as a 
team. First, invite executives and senior managers from different departments 
to create their own personal answers to these questions. It’s a safe bet they 
each have a different image of what your ideal customers look and act like.
After everyone shares their responses, work as a group to create a customer 
composite that works for everybody.
Once everyone is on the same page, continue the process by getting everyone 
to answer additional questions.
Attracting Your Ideal Customers
The second question, once your group has dreamed up your ideal customer, 
is this: How can we attract this customer?
For this question, start immediately by brainstorming as a team, rather than 
individually. One idea will lead to another. Here are a few areas to talk about 
to get you started:
Branding
• 
Advertising
• 
Public Relations
• 
Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
• 
Partnerships
• 
Word of Mouth
• 
Developing Trust
Once you know how you want to attract your ideal customers, ask your team 
this third question: How can we earn our customers’ trust?
One of the best ways to do this is to use “social proof.” Social proof is 
obtained simply by referencing other people who recommend your products 
and services.
You may not realize it, but you most likely have a treasure trove of individuals  
who can serve as your brand champions. Look at your client list. Do any 
names jump out as those that could be used as references?

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
41
Or better yet, implement a process at the end of each client engagement that 
helps build your testimonial archive. After a pleasant transaction, ask your 
satisfied customers to write a brief testimonial or recommendation about their 
experience with your company. The key is to request this while the memory of 
your excellent product or service is fresh in the customer’s mind. Ask if it is 
possible to post the testimonial on your web site or marketing materials.
The best testimonials discuss why your clients decided to buy from you or 
hire you and then highlight the ways you helped them solve their problems and 
address their issues. When prospective customers read the references or  
testimonials, the content is trusted more because it’s coming from a third party.
Where Are Your Ideal Customers?
Here’s the fourth question to ask your team: Where do our ideal customers 
spend their time? Put together a very specific list and consider the following:
Trade shows
• 
Partner related events
• 
Social media
• 
Forums/blogs
• 
Associations
• 
Media
• 
Directories/databases
• 
How Will You Reach Your Ideal Customers?
The fifth question for your Customer Intelligence team is this: How can we 
reach our ideal customers? There are many methods you can try, including 
the following:
Sponsorships
• 
Mailers
• 
Forums/blogs
• 
Broadcast media (TV, radio, or paper)
• 
Billboards
• 
Short Message Systems (SMS)
• 
Internet marketing and/or digital marketing
• 

Chapter 3 | Customer Intelligence
42
Social media (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, 
• 
Google+, Pinterest, or Tumblr)
Banner ads
• 
Content and e-mail marketing
• 
SEO
• 
Mobile
• 
You don’t need a presence on every platform. Your answers need to be unique 
to your organization. For example, a government client might not fit in any 
of the bullets listed above. Professional products and services work best on 
LinkedIn or SlideShare. Make sure to plan well and keep your customers in 
mind.
Take every opportunity to be helpful to your potential customers. Many of the 
media listed above give you the chance to offer information, tips, and tricks 
that will help your audience accomplish a goal. Don’t be afraid to give away 
free information. That’s one great way to build trust.
If there is a forum where someone has an issue or question that you have the 
answer to, respond. If a journalist opens up a comment thread based on an 
article and someone has a question, respond. This is also true with fan pages 
and other social media sites. But, beware. If you are constantly promoting 
yourself and your company, you will immediately lose respect. Our society 
continues to slowly evolve from its previous attitude of “sell, sell, sell” to that 
of “share, share, share.”

Habits
Most of the customers you attract to your business will want to retain your 
products or services. But once you’ve brought them in, how do you keep 
them coming back for more?
The secret is to engage your customers and provide a positive, instant gratifying  
experience (emotional reward). This will create a habit and get your customers  
to return again and again. Three avenues through which your business can 
cultivate a relationship with customers are your web site, tablet applications 
(apps), and mobile apps.
There are some basic design considerations to keep in mind at your touch 
points with your customer base. Company sites and apps should demonstrate 
these features:
Simplicity: They must allow customers to get to data 
• 
quickly. They must be easy to filter and sort, requiring as 
few clicks, taps, and other motions as possible.
Flexibility: They should be easy to use across multiple 
• 
devices, including mobiles, tablets, laptops, and desktops.
Bi-directionality: Not only should you be able to commu-
• 
nicate with consumers from your sites, but they should 
be able to communicate with you too. Depending on your 
product and the size of your customer base, customer 
service representatives should be accessible via phone, 
instant chat, e-mail, text, and forums.
Functionality: Your web sites should load quickly and 
• 
online business transactions should be easy to complete.
Security: Data should be secure from security breaches 
• 
and threats when within web sites and apps as well as 
when moving from app to app. Customers should be 
informed that their data is secure.
As you design your web sites and apps, get inside the minds of your customers. 
Walk in their shoes when you’re creating interfaces. Just like a good actor 
playing a role, think about what motivates your customers and what they want 
to accomplish thanks to your product.
Another way to form a habit for your customers is to build a community 
around them. Businesses like Weight Watchers, Facebook, Rosetta Stone, 
Avon, and Virgin have done this successfully, giving their customers, users, and 
followers a sense of belonging. This belonging can come from being part of 
something that is making a big positive impact in society, like fighting obesity 
or creating more awareness around breast cancer. Or it could come from the 
ability to connect emotionally with friends and like-minded people from all 
over the world by sharing similar opinions about your business.

Chapter 3 | Customer Intelligence
44
Humans are social beings. We have a strong desire to join with others in 
places like sports clubs, gyms, teams, and communities. Here are some of the 
benefits we get by being part of a community:
Sharing (stories, gossip, ideas)
• 
Entertainment
• 
Respect and appreciation
• 
Being with like-minded people
• 
Connecting through friendship, compassion, and caring, as 
• 
well as giving love
Some businesses have been able to create a dynamic environment for their 
customers and partners. They share information, collaborate on ideas, modify 
their products through feedback, and spur growth for their customers,  
partners, and themselves through the use of this collective intelligence.7 
Through community, they invite trust and openness. Figure 3-2 shows the 
stages that customers go through when forming habits. Observe how these 
stages can be met through the creation of a dynamic customer community.
Habit (Belonging)
Reward 
(Instant/Delayed)
Fear (Positive: 
Caution)
Trust
Figure 3-2.  Stages to habit
At their core, it’s the emotional connection and personal relationship between 
a business and its customer that makes the business successful. These 
emotional connections increase interactions and make participation a habit.
Also, emotional social influence can strongly dictate what we try and eventually 
buy because social networking and online communities foster a strong sense 
of trust. It’s likely that you have either listened to music online or read an 
article because someone in your social network recommended it.8

Business decision makers must engage customers and partners authentically. 
It is not about getting attention at any cost. It is about creating a 
relationship—a bond.
Customer Analytics
With the advent of smart mobile devices, we receive coupons, certificates, and 
updates through apps, e-mail, and text messages—instantly.
You can take customer analytics a lot further today than you could before the 
mass adoption of the smartphone. For example, in-store behavior intelligence 
companies have expanded their technology offerings to track a consumer’s 
experience as they shop—by using their mobile device.9 To ethically incentivize 
consumers to share personal data with retailers (which they might otherwise 
prefer to keep private), stores are now offering instant rewards like coupons. 
If you are within a certain radius of the store, a GPS tracking mechanism will 
locate you and then send you a special deal customized to your previous 
purchase data. It’s getting to the point where the salesperson will be able to 
greet you by name upon your arrival with three sweaters in your favorite 
colors—and in your size—that are discounted just for you because of your 
decision to come into the store.
Once you enter a shop, barcode or QR code scanning capabilities offer retailers  
more opportunities to engage with you. When you pay for your items, the 
check-out clerk may ask for your e-mail as a method to send receipts. Then, 
voila, there is a coupon in your inbox for your next shopping trip that may 
be personalized the same way Amazon makes recommendations for other 
books—by looking at what you bought and comparing it with items purchased 
by other customers who bought the same thing.
Tracking technology can also be used to identify ways to improve store 
products, promotions, and the overall customer experience. You probably 
don’t even recognize the cameras and facial recognition software that track 
your expressions and predict your next move while shopping.
Many retail businesses use Customer Intelligence to continually evolve and 
improve their business. We can all learn from savvy retailers when thinking 
about how to understand and engage our customer. Your customer analytics 
should focus on the behavior and mindset of your customers as well as that

of others who are engaged with your videos, web sites, blogs, etc. Here are 
three questions you should ask:
Why are your customers doing business with you?
• 
Why are they receptive to your message, brand, products, 
• 
and services?
How are the audiences who read and watch the mate-
• 
rial you put out engaging with that material? (your media 
customers, whose level of interest indicates they may be 
“pre-customers”)
Understanding your existing customers and what motivates them (as well as 
your pre-customers for your videos and social media campaigns) is the key 
to keeping them as loyal members of your company’s family. When you know 
what they want, you can give them more.
Data for customer analytics can come from various sources, such as the 
following:
Social media
• 
Web clickstreams
• 
Sales reports
• 
Call detail records
• 
Customer service
• 
Service and delivery records
• 
Contract management
• 
Order management
• 
The data that is derived from customer analytics can help transform and 
add value to your relationship with customers, and even your partners. 
Pay attention to some of your customers’ behavior. What is the retention 
rate? What are they marking on their surveys? How do they prefer to 
communicate with your company?
Companies should have a list of data sources they continually monitor and 
track to understand customer engagement, such as the following:
Customer experience
• 
Satisfaction surveys
• 
Social media engagement: click-through to webinars,  
• 
videos, and podcasts
Communication preference: e-mail, text, chat, or phone

You might think that some of the bullets overlap, but they are indeed separate. 
For example, customer experience is a different entity than satisfaction surveys. 
Customer experience is a written or verbal description by your customers 
detailing what they gained or lost by doing business with you. If they’ve had 
a good experience, you can ask them for permission to use a portion of the 
material they’ve communicated as a testimonial. Satisfaction surveys are usually 
multiple-choice affairs, with a few fill-in-the-blank questions drawing out either a 
positive experience with your company or areas you need to improve.
Another item worth examining is the actual cost per deliverable versus the  
perceived satisfaction of that deliverable. Did your customers think the cost 
was too high, against the value they received, or did they believe the value they 
received was more than expected?
Behavior and Predictive Analytics
The two primary areas that drive customer analytics are behavior and 
prediction. Amazon has mastered these, connecting your search and purchase 
behavior, then predicting what else you might like by comparing it to other 
customers who have viewed the same things.
There’s one thing you should keep in mind. If the criteria for your ideal 
customer has changed from your current customers, even slightly, the past 
behaviors of your current customers are no longer the only valid indicators of 
future predictive analytics. Let’s say you sell a product that tracks body activity  
movements. You had previously identified your ideal customer segment as 
runners, and subsequently marketed to them. At a recent meeting, however, 
your team determined that your customer segment has expanded from 
runners to include the health conscious. So you now might need to think 
about how to market to customers who drink tea, golf, or dance. Since those 
people aren’t in your customer database, analyzing your current customers 
won’t help you understand this new, untapped group.

Digital Analytics
If you’re staying with the same ideal customer, though, there is a lot of data out 
there to be collected, including information from your web site, social media, 
mobile apps, CRM application, sales system, customer support, and more.
Digital analytics enables you to determine the strategy direction your 
company needs to take. There are dozens of tools to choose from to help 
you manage this process. But first you need to understand what is best for 
your type of business. The point of these analytics is to determine if marketing  
activities and engagements are heading in the right direction, and what, if anything, 
needs to change.

Digital analytics is a continually evolving process that benefits all parties, since 
the feedback collected will then be channeled into improving the product 
and benefiting society on the whole. As the public demands additional 
capabilities such as better speed, performance, flexibility, and more, you have 
to continually improve your business by exploring new possibilities. The 
good news is that many IT vendors can scale to your needs, thanks to cloud-
based solutions. Make a plan first and then look for a solution that you can 
grow into. Rethink what it is you want, based on your current state and 
where you want to go.

Another key area to analyze is the type of digital media messaging you are 
utilizing. Is it paid, owned, or earned?
Paid: Variable messaging costs such as PR, branding, adver-
• 
tisements, paid search engine marketing, and banners
Owned: Your own in-house content, such as web sites, 
• 
blogs, and social media accounts and pages
Earned: Media exposure from articles written about you, 
• 
conversations held by your advocates and influencers, 
and word of mouth
Companies frequently use a mix of paid, owned, and earned media, as shown 
in Figure 3-4. Understanding your outbound marketing methods enables you 
to better track and monitor your return on investment (ROI) as it relates to 
digital analytics.

Everything you’re tracking should measure your progress toward a goal. 
Are you trying to solve a problem? Do you want to see if a certain campaign 
is driving attention? Are you tracking feedback about a new launch?
Within digital analytics, I will highlight two basic data sources: web analytics 
and mobile analytics.
Web Analytics
Did you ever go to a travel website looking for flights or hotels, then switch to 
another site to compare deals? When you click on the alternative site, all of 
your search criteria has been magically filled out on the new site’s forms—the  
number of days traveling, where you’re departing from, and where your 
destination is. How does that happen? Your information is being tracked 
through the use of cookies and other devices.

Chapter 3 | Customer Intelligence
50
This information helps companies make decisions about how to handle every-
thing from marketing campaigns to the exact words and pictures they use on 
their web sites. Web analytics helps collect what happens before a customer 
buys, how long customers stay on a web site, and even when in the process 
they jump off—for example, when they abandon their shopping cart instead 
of buying. Mastering this analysis and responding correctly to the information 
you receive can lead to revenue growth and repeatedly attracting and retaining  
customers. The correct use of web analytics helps determine if you’re receiving  
the proper return on your company’s marketing investments.
Web analytics also helps businesses evaluate what type of online marketing 
is most beneficial. For example, if you are looking for a proactive outbound 
marketing activity and need to know what to choose, web analytics can inform 
you as to the most appropriate options.
In the recent past, web analytics would only measure simple information like 
the number of visitors to your site, search engine keywords leading to your 
site, and how long a customer stayed on your site. This is known as web click-
stream analysis. These days, web analytics has become more sophisticated, as 
businesses are demanding to know more and more about their customers.
Understanding Your Audience
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) uses YouTube to get its message out 
in video format. The VA has generated over 500 videos, each with an average 
length of three minutes. It even has its own YouTube Channel, with an intro-
ductory promotional video.
YouTube has become one of the top search engines in the world. More and 
more people are getting their information via video, and YouTube provides 
businesses with plenty of useful analytics to help them optimize the ability to 
attract viewers and keep them engaged.
The VA is one of many organizations utilizing video and other social media 
formats to improve their ROI. Analytics allow you to learn your audience 
demographics, how long they watch each video, and understand which videos 
attract the most viewers.
The goals of your videos should be to build trust in a way that either educates, 
entertains, or benefits your customers, without seeming a blatant commercial.  
No one is searching YouTube in order to be sold something. If people do 
search for commercials, it’s for entertainment purposes or curiosity, or maybe 
they’re nostalgically looking for old Pepsodent commercials.

Mobile Analytics
Mobile analytics looks at how your customers use your company’s apps. 
The design and functionality for mobile apps need to be appealing and usable 
for customers.
Though analytics for mobile apps can tell you the number and demographics 
of new and active users, the most important index that businesses can track is 
how their customers interact with an app. Are the apps converting customers 
to become retained, satisfied followers or advocates? Are customers in the 
habit of using the business’s mobile app? As we discussed earlier in the chapter, 
customers want to form habits with apps that provide them with rewards of 
some kind.
Detailed analytical reports about customer behavior with mobile apps typically 
answer the following sorts of questions:
How do screens rank in popularity?
• 
How often do customers use the app?
• 
How much time is the app used for?
• 
Is a promotional code or coupon being used?
• 
What keywords are being used as a customer searches 
• 
for the app?
Like all analytics, mobile analytics should be used as a method for process 
improvement. What tactics connect with customers and keep them engaged 
and coming back for more? What bores them? What drives customers to 
make certain decisions? Good mobile app intelligence tries to understand the 
customers’ unconscious habits. The trick to attracting customers is to learn from 
your analytics what makes the ultimate positive experience for them, then modify 
your processes and systems, and realign the strategies and tactics involved.
Consensus
Customer Intelligence is about mapping and wiring your business mind  
for customer success. Not your success or your company’s success— 
your customers’ success. Look at your organization. Do you have customer 
data sources separated by department? Do you have a central way of capturing 
customer analytics? How is the overall performance of customer relationship 
evaluated?
In the next chapter on Data Intelligence, I highlight the significance of con-
solidation, sharing, and collaboration for visual communication and decisions 
across the business for everything you do.

Reinvent and Recreate Your Business
The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.
— Robertson Davies, Tempest-Tost
How do you bring together teams from different business lines to develop a 
more cohesive approach to connect and converse about critical decisions?
That is the crux of your task when you utilize Data Transformational 
Intelligence.
Data Intelligence is about the process and steps to synchronously commu-
nicate and interpret data across teams and groups of individuals within a 
department, across departments, with third party vendors, partners, and even 
sometimes between two or more organizations.
The Power of Visual Data
Visual data can be a powerful ally when you want to make sure the informa-
tion you are communicating is understood and received in the way that you 
intend. You see, people within a department may be familiar with their own 
data, but when seven departments or organizations each bring their own data 
to the table, there’s too much to read and absorb. You need some kind of 
shorthand that enables you to quickly get to the heart of what the data means 

Chapter 4 | Data Intelligence
54
and that lets you communicate transparently about the information it repre-
sents. Visual data lets you accomplish those tasks.
I once was tasked with providing a visual performance management strategy 
plan to the United States Postal Service (USPS) CIO office that would allow 
for collaboration, communication, and sharing of data across the enterprise’s 
different departments. I discovered that decision makers crave instant, accu-
rate, and reliable visuals of their data. Sharing information in a visual format 
makes it easier for executives and senior managers in different departments 
to connect about critical decisions that affect them all.
How the Brain Perceives Visual Information
Let’s take a minute to explore how your brain processes visual information. 
When you see something—be it text, a static image, or a moving object—
light stimulates the retina, giving you a visual perception that is controlled 
by the visual cortex. The visual cortex is located within the occipital lobe 
of your brain, as shown previously in Figure 1-1. This process happens very 
fast. The visual cortex is made up of specialized neurons that turn the sensa-
tions received from the optic nerve into meaningful images. Perception is how 
the brain interprets the environment based on information that the sensory 
organs, including the eyes, pick up.
However, the process of interpreting what you saw does not stop there. The 
visual perception of what you saw and—note here—paid attention to then 
sends signals to the cerebral cortex of your brain. I emphasize “paid attention 
to” because the brain has blind spots or gaps where you don’t notice things, 
causing you to fill in your own interpretation of events. The visual cortex 
simply fills in the small hole in your vision with similar patterns from the sur-
rounding areas, so you never notice what’s missing.
The cerebral cortex of your brain is also where the cognitive conscious part 
of what you saw kicks in. This reaction is similar to turning on a light switch. 
The cerebral cortex interprets what you visually paid attention to and then 
stores that interpretation in your memory.
Thanks to this process, orienting data in a visual format will help ensure 
that your audience focuses on the information you want them to pay 
attention to. 
Creating Impact with Visual Designs
Since visual data can be so effective, let’s talk about how to optimize your 
visual designs so that they have the highest impact possible.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
55
Why are some gaming applications more successful than others? Part of what 
makes these games so addictive is the pure simplicity of their design. If you’ve 
ever been hooked on a game like Bejeweled Blitz or Candy Crush Saga, and 
played it for an extended period of time—say 45 minutes straight—you may 
have experienced the phenomenon of closing your eyes and involuntarily see-
ing the jewels or candies from the game.
That couldn’t happen with a more complex design.
So if we want to design an easy to perceive message, both the overall image 
and the items within it need to be in simple, bite-sized chunks. Since an over-
load of data causes most people to feel overwhelmed, you only want to dis-
play data that is critical to helping everyone make effective and well-informed 
decisions.
For example, if you were assessing customer support issues, here are a few 
icons you might consider for use in your visual report in Figure 4-1:
Case Management System icon > displayed as a brief-
• 
case showing the number of cases that are particularly 
important
Help Desk icon > image of a help desk support person 
• 
representing the number of support tickets logged
Phone icon > demonstrated to represent volume of calls 
• 
Figure 4-1. Visual cues individually displayed
As we have learned, visual representations of data need to have common 
definitions and interpretations within the organization. For example, if your 
case management system is down, causing a high volume of incidents and 
longer calls, using visual cues to convey the message takes less time than using 
long and descriptive text. When your company knows what these images 
signify, communicating with a single image icon gets the message across more 
expeditiously, as shown in Figure 4-2. 

Chapter 4 | Data Intelligence
56
Data Confusion
Visual data, in particular, and any form of data can unfortunately also be used 
to create data confusion. Data confusion occurs when numbers are skewed 
to prove a point, gain votes, or start an argument. Something unproven, or 
even untrue, can now seem like the truth. Data confusion is most powerful 
when it’s visual in nature, but can still occur when it’s not. You’d be surprised 
at how often politicians, members of the media, researchers, executives, and 
even authors use misleading data. In meetings, I have seen marketing statistics 
showcasing 100% customer satisfaction. Wow, that seems pretty impressive, 
but what does such a claim mean? How many customers is that based on? In 
reality, it could be from a sample size of one. While this information is valid, it 
doesn’t paint the proper picture and unaware individuals may make decisions 
based on faulty “facts.” You wouldn’t want to base your decision to move for-
ward with a program if only one client had reported 100% satisfaction. You’d 
want more data and feedback to ensure that the program will be successful 
when it’s launched.
While many companies intentionally use data confusion as a marketing weapon, 
it occurs unintentionally with even greater frequency. Often data is presented 
in a visual reporting type format—charts, graphs, or icons—that creates inac-
curate impressions. Other times you are given numerous amounts of data in 
report formats that you have no idea what to do with. You don’t know how 
to interpret the data, what you’re looking for, or what is missing. You are so 
overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of information that you depend on others 
to translate the data for you in order to make a decision. But, there’s a catch.
This approach allows for errors and misinterpretation, and this is not some-
thing you can afford to have happen. Each individual is trained to visually 
encode and interpret information—shapes, color, text, and images—in a cer-
tain way. The brain is primed to focus attention on what it has previously

stored. Therefore, when there are multiple people involved, individuals have 
different perceptions based on what they visually recall from their past expe-
rience. This is why disagreements and conflicts can occur. You cannot assume 
everyone involved will interpret data the same way.
Further, everyone involved may not have the same definition of the data being 
presented. For example, if you ask three different senior managers for the 
average units sold last year, the responses could vary widely since there are at 
least three different definitions of an “average” when it comes to statistics.
Senior Manager A calculates the average based on the 
• 
mean—the total sum of all numbers divided by the quan-
tity of numbers
Senior Manager B calculates the average based on the 
• 
median—the middle value of the list of numbers spread 
in numerical order
Senior Manager C calculates the average based on the 
• 
mode—the value that occurs most often
Table 4-1 shows the number of units sold per month in a given year.
Table 4-1.  Number of units sold per month
Senior Manager A’s “average” is 35.
• 
(23 + 33 + 42 + 31 + 23+ 32 + 23 + 37 + 48 + 33 +  
• 
48 + 47) / 12 months = 35
Senior Manager B’s “average” is 33. B hears the word 
• 
average but calculates the median.
(23, 23, 23, 31, 32, 33, 33, 37, 42, 47, 48, 48) = numbers 
• 
rewritten in order. Since there are 12 months, the 
middle would be the 6th number. The median is 33.
Senior Manager C’s “average” is 23 since the number of 
• 
units sold most often is 23.
The resulting numbers can vary considerably, as can their significance. This 
issue mostly occurs in a siloed organization, where there is no communication 
of universal definitions between departments, as opposed to an integrated 
one. Even in an integrated environment, definitions and processes need to be 
continually checked and improved, due to constantly changing influences and 
pressures that occur in an organization. For example, external mandates, big 
data, and social connections can change the statistics you utilize.

Chapter 4 | Data Intelligence
58
One of the questions you need to consistently ask yourself is “Why should 
I believe the information I have before me is accurate?” How can you make 
sure that you’re not being unduly influenced by data confusion when making 
decisions? How do you gain visual clarity, create a common language, and 
make sure everyone is seeing and interpreting information in the same way 
across the enterprise?
A few years back, my team and I presented to 12 decision makers and influenc-
ers at the Small Business Administration (SBA) about a type of performance 
reporting for the CIO’s office. At the time, the SBA’s CIO had a preference to 
see data visually laid out in bubble charts. “Why specifically bubbles?” I asked. 
Her answer was that it just made sense to her. She knew how to interpret the 
information when it was presented in that format. It was in her comfort zone, 
and she had a positive visual emotional experience with it. But, the resulting 
issue was making sure that visual format was easily understood by those who 
reported to her and by those who were collecting the data. 
Unified Data Clarity
So how do you get everyone on the same page when interpreting and com-
municating information about the same data—text, numbers, images, shapes, 
and symbols? You need to have conversations about what data means to the 
organization. The standards that you establish need to be learned, shared, and 
encoded through training and repetition. Repetition as a group will help to 
establish habits so that everyone jointly recalls, interprets, and translates the 
information in a unified way. This newly learned behavior will minimize risk 
and increase consistency and confidence in the information when presented 
both internally and externally. 
Data Intelligence  
Do you have a Data Intelligence of your organization, department, or division?  
Data Intelligence is built on the Nine C’s—collaborating, consolidating, 
communicating, collecting, connecting, coordinating, changing, conversing, and 
converting, as shown in Figure 4-3.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind

As we discussed earlier, Data Intelligence represents the need to univer-
sally interpret data by teams and groups of individuals within a department, 
across departments, with third party vendors, partners, and even sometimes 
between two or more organizations, as is the case with the Defense Technical 
Information Center (DTIC).
One of DTIC’s main functions is to serve as the research and engineering hub 
for the Department of Defense (DoD), providing and sharing scientific and 
technical information to and with other agencies. DTIC is also a web host-
ing provider for DoD agencies. Because of these critical roles, DTIC needs 
answers to certain questions from the agencies and partners it supports: 
Why does this agency need this data?
• 
Who in the agency need access to this data?
• 
What types of data do they need?
• 
When do they need this data?
• 
Where do changes need to be made to access the data?
• 
How is this data provided?
• 
When my company worked with DTIC, we helped them outline their security 
infrastructure and established a plan for data security considerations as data 
was stored and passed between agencies. We also helped them understand 
who had access to the data, at which security levels, and plotted the data 
flow to be seamless between agencies. Here, the client’s resulting initiative 
was to have an integrated and collaborative security plan to share data across 
agencies.

Integration of data across different organizations occurs frequently and is very 
common in mergers and acquisitions. Typically, though, organizations are look-
ing for visual insight and intelligence into their own company as they migrate 
from a siloed to an integrated environment. When I worked with the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), a federal government agency that pro-
tects pensions, I led a team to support the integration of information, pro-
cesses, and technologies of two major departments within the agency—the 
Office of Chief Counsel (OCC) and the Department of Insurance Supervision 
and Compliance (DISC). The two departments were separate and needed to 
be integrated. I helped them to integrate their legal matter management sys-
tem and the financial case management system into one customized system 
that provided data intelligence for executives and decision makers, so they 
could better support their customers.
The Six Reporter Questions and the Nine C’s
Planning for Data Intelligence starts by applying the Nine C’s no matter how 
large or complex you think your business goals, objectives, and initiatives are. 
The Nine C’s provide insight into what is happening with the data. All of the 
Nine C’s need to be considered in order to maximize Data Intelligence. You 
also need to answer the six reporter questions all journalists are taught to 
include in their stories—why, who, what, when, where, and how as shown in 
Figure 4-4.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
61
Here’s how you map the six reporter questions to the Nine C’s to gain Data 
Intelligence:
• 
Why - Why is there a need to Collaborate and/or 
Consolidate the data?
• 
Who - Who needs to Communicate with the data?
• 
What - What data do I need to Collect?
• 
When - When do I need to Connect and Coordinate 
efforts about the data?
• 
Where - Where do I need to make Changes about the 
data?
• 
How - How do I Converse about the data and Convert 
to new ways of interacting with it?
Using PBGC’s data plan as an example, Table 4-2 demonstrates the call to 
action by using the six reporter questions with the Nine C’s.

Let’s dive a bit deeper into the Data Intelligence when the six reporter ques-
tions are mapped to the Nine C’s.
Why Collaborate and Consolidate
What kind of new initiative are you bringing to your company? Whether it’s big 
data, business intelligence, mobility, cloud, governance, compliance, or security, 
you must start off knowing why you need to collaborate and consolidate,
For example, DTIC planned to create the DTIC Information Cloud for the 
purpose of building a knowledge-sharing community where DoD researchers 
and acquisition professionals could find people, ask questions, and search data-
bases of different topics. The question of “Why is there a need to collaborate 
on the data?” was answered for DTIC in a clear and resounding way and set 
the tone for the project.
That clarity is crucial to obtain for whatever initiative you are bringing to 
the table.
Collaborating
The word “collaboration” may have multiple definitions across your company. 
My definition is as follows: Collaboration happens when teams of people join 
together in order to plan and execute activities with the purpose of transforming and 
driving value through improvement of performance.
Performance improvement can be accomplished across multiple organizations, 
departments, divisions, or teams.
You are welcome to use my definition or refine it for your organization. Just 
make sure everyone else has the same definition.
Table 4-2.  Data Intelligence and the Six Reporter Questions

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
63
Consolidating
The act of consolidating is usually interpreted to mean the merger or acquisition 
of companies. However, internal consolidation within an organization happens 
quite frequently. When you do decide to consolidate ideas and processes, 
there needs to be mental preparation and readiness. Transitioning from a siloed 
organization to an integrated one requires managing the flow of information, 
processes, and technologies across the company.
It’s important to have an intelligence hub from which governance, risk, and 
compliance can be managed. This will be the central repository of unified 
definitions, processes, and enterprise-wide data oversight. The mission of the 
intelligence hub is to make sure the company’s vision, strategies, plans, and 
processes work and function in harmony.
Who Communicates
Who needs to communicate with the data?
In the PBGC example, attorneys, paralegals, financial analysts, and actuaries are 
listed as the key individuals interacting with the data. But, it is crucial to iden-
tify others who could be impacted by updates, changes, or modifications done 
to the data. Also, who else might benefit from improved data, thanks to collab-
oration and/or consolidation? Who else needs insight into Data Intelligence?
Many do not account for external parties that also need Data Intelligence, 
such as partners, clients, vendors, and auditors. Have you accounted for oth-
ers within your company who might not require daily Data Intelligence, but 
would still benefit from occasional insight into the data? Examples could be 
board members, compliance officers, audit officers, the legal team, risk officers, 
or executives. Think about who else is potentially impacted by the why of your 
efforts. Particularly when you are setting targets.
Let me give you an example of a scenario encountered by a client because 
they didn’t include their vendors when setting targets, and thus didn’t factor 
in a significant vendor data point. There was also a problem with the client’s 
documentation that further complicated things.
My international client’s IT department was seeing a sharp increase in volume 
of dissatisfaction calls, support tickets, and poor ratings from their own inter-
nal customers, the business users. What was going on? It turned out that the 
telecommunications was down and IT was expected to respond within four 
hours. Four hours had gone by and there was no response from IT, let alone 
a resolution. IT was waiting on Verizon to respond to them. They had a formal 
service level agreement (SLA) with their third party provider, Verizon, and 
Verizon’s response time to the IT department was eight hours, a very large 
variance from IT’s promise of four hours.

Chapter 4 | Data Intelligence
64
Unlike with Verizon, IT did not have a formal internal SLA with its business 
users. Although it was ideal for IT to respond to internal business users within 
a set time frame, they were not accountable for it—and reasonably so. If 
there had been formal internal documentation and agreement of expectation, 
then the gap between the third party and IT’s time frame would have been 
detected.
Don’t Forget About Your Customers
You might think that your customers are not part of your collaborative data 
efforts. This is not true. You most likely already collaborate with them through 
forums, surveys, and other means of communication. How about feedback 
received through your support call center? Think about the various ways you 
are capturing information from your customers for improvement.
What to Collect
Do you have a clear idea of what data you need to collect?
To help you picture this, gather and document requirements. Assess the 
impacts, both internally and externally. Areas affected by the data could be 
finances, customer satisfaction, or safety. For example, let’s say you have a proj-
ect initiative called “Bring-Your-Own-Device” (BYOD), where all employees 
need to provide their own tablet or smartphone to be used at least partially 
for work purposes. Your why is that everyone must be able to interact with 
the new applications your business is using, understand the data flow, and then 
use that information to improve business performance. Your who refers to 
decision makers from HR, legal, financial procurement, IT, and employees. You 
start collecting the what by asking questions. Here are some sample questions 
you might consider:
Who buys the device and pays for its data plan?
• 
Who will have access to what data?
• 
Should all charges be reimbursed or should there be a set 
• 
fixed amount covered?
What are the security requirements at the different levels 
• 
(devices, applications, and data)?
What type of support will be provided (device or corpo-
• 
rate application running on the device)?
What devices will be supported?
• 
Is this program in compliance with other corporate initia-
• 
tives (such as Green IT)?

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
65
When you explore why this new initiative was created, you can begin to  
better understand how it can be used to collaborate and communicate data 
with employees, partners, and clients. 
Visual Analytics
The process of analyzing and deciding what data you need to capture for 
Data Intelligence can be enhanced by visual analytics, which can help deter-
mine what data needs to be collected and displayed visually as well as how to 
organize it into measures, metrics, and key performance indicators (KPIs). The 
target for the why needs to also be defined.
When you tell someone a story, it paints a picture. For example, I was looking 
to travel from Washington, DC to New York during the holidays. Looking at 
the number of flights, I could see they were scheduled to depart on the hour 
every hour. However, some flights were either being cancelled or delayed due

The measures, metrics, and KPIs, as bulleted below, help bring the visual to life, 
so a key decision maker clearly sees what action must be taken. As mentioned 
before, when communicating this information, it helps to use simple, easy-to-
understand graphics, like the briefcase icons shown in the customer support 
example.
Measures = number of flights
• 
Metrics = number of flights per day x every hour
• 
KPIs = weather conditions
• 
In this scenario, the decision maker is the customer for the airlines and air-
port—me. However, there are other people who will find this data valuable, 
who need to be made aware of it. Can you create a list of the who? Who else 
besides the customer would need to have visibility into weather conditions 
and status of flights?
Manufacturers delivering products via air travel and also the airlines them-
selves need to be kept abreast of flight status, as they are linked with revenue 
and other key impacts. These organizations could lose revenue and get off 
track from their target based on the goal that has been linked with the KPI 
(the weather condition). The target is measured against a baseline such as last 
year’s flight results within a set time frame, say the holiday season. The visual 
data could reflect a range of performance indicators that lets the viewer see 
flight statuses.
As part of your requirement gathering, how do you determine when it is best 
to connect the data to other resources? For example, when is the best time 
to have the customer connect with the data regarding delayed or canceled 
flights?

Operational Analytics
Now it is time to connect the dots and review the coordination of the data 
flow itself. Operational analytics bridges the gap and connects people, pro-
cesses, technology, and information. For operational analytics to be properly 
monitored and tracked—sometimes in real-time—there needs to be an intel-
ligence hub placed in this area as well. Practices and architecture are also 
implemented in this phase to ensure compliance issues, government regula-
tions, and audit requirements are met. The team that makes up the intelligence 
hub will address how the data is to be organized and integrated, in addition to 
accounting for security and privacy.
The intelligence hub also coordinates which steps must follow each other 
when communicating data across the organization. When a specific data touch 
point is completed, then whatever comes next must begin. This can also involve 
the monitoring of which activities are best practices and industry standards, 
such as minimizing cost, managing risk, and eliminating security threats. You 
want to get to the point of being able to visually detect and handle issues that 
arise from day-to-day operational activities before they occur. To get there, 
you must continuously improve your processes.
Where to Change
When you have addressed the why, who, what, and when, you can start to look 
for other opportunities to improve your organization. You ask, “Where do 
I need to make changes?”
Imagine there is an external regulation that has changed. You need to incor-
porate it into your business operations and to your data processes. Where 
do you make those changes? Visually knowing where the data is stored allows 
you to address those issues more easily. That’s also true if the need to make a 
change comes internally, as is the case with a new initiative. Today it is all about 
cloud computing, big data, business intelligence, and mobility. Tomorrow it will 
be about something else. Having a framework in the form of documented 
approaches and processes allows you to take a proactive approach to chang-
ing environments.
How to Converse and Convert
How will you converse about changes that are needed? What if those needs 
require innovations to your products or your procedures? How do you han-
dle forward thinking in your organization?
Is there a plan in place for who will do what to take proactive measures?  
A bad scenario is when you need to react to a change and you have no plan, 
not knowing how the changes will impact different areas of the business.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
67
Create a visual map for how your organization will take action. How can you 
identify the audience who will be impacted? Do the changes require a corpo-
rate communication message? Will the change require training? What meth-
ods are in place for handling clients? Is support or customer care prepared 
to answer and respond to client inquiries? How do you create conversations 
about the data? Do you capture or disseminate data through social media, 
web forums, online communities, or virtual events?
As you brainstorm with different people within your organization, you will 
create a specific, fine-tuned process plan. Observe the way that data travels. 
Assess the impact, issues, and risks, plus identify the root causes of any issues 
that arise.
Is there a way to introduce newer, innovative ways to do things? How about  
converting traditional communication to mobile communication? How would 
you strategize for a program such as Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD)? A BYOD  
program can increase employee performance, morale, and productivity, plus 
enable increased collaboration and quicker response time to information, 
requests, etc. How will you decide which applications are acceptable within 
the organization, and for whom? How will corporate data be managed on 
employee devices, while keeping personal information confidential?
As you can probably tell by now, the how questions involve creativity, innovation,  
and inspiration. The how is not an individual but a collective, mastermind effort. 
Mastermind Intelligence will be discussed in the next chapter.
Step Back
Technologists, scientists, and analysts are becoming more engaged with under-
standing organizational behavior on a microlevel and how it applies to the 
organization as a whole. Look within your organization, stop, and stand back. 
Who, if anyone, is championing the study and improvement of group dynamics, 
behavior, interaction, collaboration, and communication?
At the very least, reread the Data Intelligence section detailing the formula. 
Then, step back and hold the magnifying glass to your own organization. What 
changes would you make? How would you apply them? How would you  
promote creativity, innovation, teamwork, and productivity?
Step outside yourself and your organization and then really dare to visualize. 
What do you see?

Mastermind 
Intelligence
Rewire Your Business
New ideas are the lifeblood of any dynamic company. Eliciting fresh thoughts 
and perspectives on company offerings, marketing campaigns, or customer 
needs ensures that your company stays competitive through the innovation of 
new products, services, and ways to solve customer problems.
More than likely, the people in your organization have many great ideas to improve 
every aspect of your business. However, many companies can get so caught up in 
daily responsibilities that they fail to set aside time to generate new ideas. Leadership 
can too easily forget that innovation can be unearthed from many corners:  
sales people, customer liaisons, product designers, and, of course, marketing teams.
One of the best ways to generate top-notch ideas is through Mastermind 
Intelligence, which takes the basic concepts of brainstorming and makes them 
part of the culture of your company. The key is to create a nonjudgmental, 
respectful environment where each individual is committed to being creative 
and helpful. Support given during brainstorming is about honesty, respect, and 
compassion. It is not a competition. Rather, it is about everyone sincerely want-
ing to achieve a common goal and then finding the best ways to make it happen. 
“If you have people bringing their own ideas to the table, you get more ideas,” 
says Gary Quinn, President and CEO of FalconStor, an international software 
company. “It just becomes exponential because now their ideas are your ideas. 
Before you know it, you have fostered an environment of creativity and ideas.”1

Leading with Innovation
The best risk you can take is on a new idea. That very idea could solve a  
client’s problem or provide a new feature or function that your customers did 
not have access to before.
Lead and be acknowledged for innovation. Strive to establish and maintain a 
track record of tackling difficult problems in new ways. Create new, disruptive 
technology that allows you to quickly gain market share.
What type of corporate culture do you want to have? Does your team 
embrace change and innovation? Create a fountain of new ideas.
Without a pipeline of new ideas, it becomes challenging to grow in a competi-
tive market.
Leveraging Mastermind Practices
Cary Bayer, founder of Bayer Communications, a corporate coaching company 
that helps executives achieve continuous company breakthroughs, believes 
that Mastermind Intelligence creates bigger ideas than that of normal thinking. 
“The Mastermind concept is designed to bring out the kinds of ideas that nor-
mally won’t surface in an organization,” he says, “especially if there is a good 
facilitator there to guide.”2
An ongoing Mastermind Intelligence culture can transform your business—
not just within your organization, but also with your partners and even your 
clients.
Mastermind practices can be of two types: (1) small group meetings that elicit 
a broad range of ideas, and (2) more formal meetings where senior leaders 
assess the top ideas.
Mastermind Intelligence results in increased originality of thought. When 
executives are launching new programs or consolidating existing ones, they 
are often uncomfortable thinking creatively. “They’re afraid that they’ll be seen 
as not grounded enough or not conservative enough within the culture of the 
organization,” says Bayer.
The nonjudgmental tone of the ideation phase of Mastermind Intelligence 
creates an environment where all ideas are welcome and enhance the flow of 
creativity.

This environment makes it easier to be inventive and sparks questions such 
as, “What can we create here?” “What can we imagine that is out of the ordinary?” 
and “How can we make sure that there is no ‘wrong answer,’ allowing the best ideas 
to emerge?”
According to Quinn, another benefit of a joint Mastermind mentality is 
employee buy-in: “We just recently got 30 people together to build a prod-
uct roadmap together. It was no longer my roadmap, it wasn’t the investor’s 
roadmap—it is the people’s roadmap. Now, they can’t say they don’t believe in 
it, because they were part of the creation.”
Create an environment conducive to sharing thoughts and ideas by asking 
people at all levels for feedback, keeping them informed about goals and proj-
ects and demonstrating how their past input has positively impacted your 
product offerings or services. 
Implementing Mastermind Intelligence in Weekly 
Meetings
There are several ways to bring Mastermind Intelligence to your 
organization.
One way is to designate part of your weekly meeting time as an open session 
to discuss ideas, challenges, or opportunities. Each attendee can raise differ-
ent topics. Often companies become so mired in everyday details that they 
don’t take time to really assess opportunities across the organization. As 
mentioned previously, try something different to break routine, such as chang-
ing the meeting time or location, so that people don’t become so used to a 
standing meeting that they become creatively lax.
During the meeting, each attendee should be encouraged to bring up a press-
ing topic. And then, don’t ignore it. I’ve often seen a senior leader state an 
opinion followed by no one challenging it. People feel uncomfortable speaking 
up in meetings, especially to challenge their boss. So if you are the one facili-
tating the meeting, don’t overtly offer your opinion on a topic. Instead, ask a 
question and ask everyone present to anonymously jot down their opinions 
on paper.
“The human being is ultimately a creative being but . . . fear-based thinking 
stifles that,” says Bayer. “As one begins to feel less threatened and therefore 
safe and relaxed, it becomes easier to open up and express opinions. Observe 
people at parties. At first, some people are tense and quiet, but once they 
start to relax, it tends to stimulate a more creative way of being.”

Chapter 5 | Mastermind Intelligence
72
Focus on having one topic on the table that needs to be addressed. This will 
allow people to really focus their resources, support, and energy on that one 
issue. In smaller businesses, a shift in the direction of campaign or in a ­program 
could immediately change the business overnight. In large ones, it may be 
more difficult to determine the overall impact brought on by a new idea.
Get people to write one or two solutions or ideas down on a piece of paper. 
Then you can truly elicit involvement by providing an environment where it 
feels safe to express an opinion.
Once people are comfortable sharing, have them vote on the most interest-
ing ideas. Then focus the rest of the meeting on those ideas. Make sure the 
discussion remains on the idea, not the person who presented it.
Businesswide Mastermind Intelligence Sessions
To fully implement Financial Intelligence, Customer Intelligence, and Data 
Intelligence, it is useful to have businesswide Mastermind Intelligence sessions. 
These sessions can be a day - or even a weekend - long affair that takes place 
offsite. In an ideal world, you might do these as often as quarterly, but your 
initial goal should be at least annually, with semi-annually being even better. 
These meetings don’t need to include everyone from your company—just 
representatives from all departments, preferably at all levels, including the 
people who directly interface with customers. If you’ve thought about your 
own organization as you read the previous chapters, there are a lot of ­possible 
topics that should come to mind. These are topics that your organization 
ought to look at holistically, with input from a wide range of departments. 
Make a list of these topics and use them to guide the agenda for your first 
businesswide Mastermind Intelligence session.
You can also prompt additional topics ahead of time from the people you’re 
inviting.
Giving each topic an appropriate title will make a difference in the response you 
get. Neuroscientist Dr. Paul Zak, Director of the multidisciplinary Center for 
Neuroeconomics Studies (CNS) at Claremont Graduate University, believes 
that you can get the best results by communicating the emotional benefits of 
what you’re trying to accomplish. “This purpose really has to be kind of what 
I call a core purpose, or how does your organization improve people’s lives,” 
he says. “If that’s transmitted clearly and consistently, then it reinforces that 
we’re all on the same team.”3
3Paul Zak, personal communication by recorded telephone interview with author, 
December 30, 2013. Passim throughout this chapter.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
73
Zak says that transactional purposes, such as creating the best product at the 
best price, are not as motivational. Ideally, “the purpose is not about maximiz-
ing sales. It’s about improving life and it’s easy to motivate teams across the 
company to be more cooperative.”
While you’re selecting employees to attend the session, don’t just look at 
departments and levels. Mastermind practices should include the key influenc-
ers and decision makers, but they should also include anyone who tends to 
be good at pulling together disparate ideas and seeing connections, themes, 
and patterns.
According to Zak, it also makes sense to have people with a variety of 
­backgrounds present. “There’s a lot of evidence that work groups diverse 
in gender, background, and ethnicity are the most innovative. There’s pretty 
good emerging science suggesting that real diversity is important. It’s not just 
the color of your skin or the language you speak, but the way you’re trained, 
where you grew up, and certainly your gender.” 
Make sure you notify session attendees about topics at least a few weeks in 
advance. Though a portion of your Mastermind Intelligence session will be 
spent brainstorming extemporaneously, it is helpful to encourage people to 
bring research to the table about the competition and even other industries 
in regards to these topics. You want to cast as wide a net as possible. That 
would also include determining if there’s any existing input from your custom-
ers and your partners.
Opening Mind
Done correctly, Mastermind practices can be a very fruitful way to open minds. 
Done without thought, they can be frustrating and a waste of time. Whether 
impromptu or scheduled, they need to have the right mix of freeform think-
ing and structure in order to result in a productive session. Particularly with 
C-level executives who tend to have time constraints, a well-structured ses-
sion can produce more satisfying results. Establishing session roles is also a 
good idea, even if they are informal. For example, the role of devil’s advocate 
could be played by someone who is not closely attached to the issue or topic. 
Assigning a facilitator or moderator can help resolve conflicts if they arise, 
keep the tone of the meeting cordial, and move the conversation along. They 
can also ensure that all voices are heard and that ideas are captured. The 
quickest way to kill a Mastermind session is to stifle ideas, ignore inputs by not 
capturing them, or give the impression that the outcome is already certain. 

Chapter 5 | Mastermind Intelligence
74
Keeping Your List
You will want to write down all the ideas that are generated during your 
Mastermind Intelligence session. Typical options include a whiteboard or large 
pad on a tripod.
While the latter may be the old-fashioned approach, I favor it because it’s more 
tangible. The pages can be taped to the walls as reminders for later reference 
and a typed version of the entire list can be emailed to all the attendees at 
a later date. The ideas can’t be erased and forgotten.  Perhaps I have been 
influenced by something Curtis Coy (introduced in Chapter 2) says not just 
for Mastermind sessions but in terms of management in general: ‘Sometimes 
when your people see you write things down, they tend to pay attention. They 
tend to follow up. They tend to know that now it’s written down and that 
they’ll be held accountable for that. Therefore, I keep a list.”4
Activating Potential
One of the hardest things to do in a Mastermind practice is to get every-
one to participate. There are always those in the room who don’t believe 
they have a voice or have confidence issues and believe their ideas are not 
worthwhile. The whole point of Mastermind practices is to hear all ideas, no 
matter how good, bad, silly, or seemingly unfeasible, and then work through 
them, eliminating them one by one until the group is left with a core few with 
exceptional potential.
People can be shy at first, so if you want to maximize the value of the time 
you’re spending during a Mastermind Intelligence session, do a pre-meeting 
warm-up. This exercise will give everyone a bit of practice using their voice in 
this particular room with these particular people.
If you’ve ever gone to an improv show where the actors take suggestions from 
the audience, you’ve seen this concept before. Pick a simple, low-stakes, wide-
open topic and give everyone present the chance to chime in with answers. 
For example, you could ask people to shout out songs that mention any kind 
of weather. People could then mention titles (or even lines from songs) such 
as “Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head,” “Sunny,” and “Stormy Weather.” (If you 
really want to loosen people up, ask them to sing their answers.)
You can also warm up people’s “ideaphoria,” a term coined by the Johnson 
O’Connor Foundation (jocrf.org) that means “the ability to generate ideas.” 
According to Bayer, this is particularly necessary because there will be some 
individuals in every room who mostly use the analytical side of their brain.

“You can’t just have ten people who are used to using their rational mind 
almost exclusively, put them in a room, and say, ‘Okay, now be creative.’”
Bayer uses a process he calls “discovery writing” to help systematic-brained 
thinkers open up their lesser-accessed neural pathways, since they tend to 
suppress their creativity:
The idea is you pick a topic the company is ultimately interested in having 
some breakthrough around. Let’s suppose the goal is to devise a new way 
of developing some new kind of software to help those in the real estate 
business. That’s the focus. For the next two minutes I would ask everyone 
in the group to have a pen and a paper and keep their pen moving for 
two minutes focused on that particular topic. Whatever comes into the 
mind, they’d be instructed to write down on the paper regardless of the 
fact that it may have nothing to do with real estate or software. Whatever 
is in the mind is written down and the pen keeps writing. The pen keeps 
moving. Those are the two ingredients for the success of this process. 
The first idea might have something to do with real estate. The second 
idea might have something to do with new ways of looking at software. 
The third idea might be, “I can’t think of anything else.” That’s what you’d 
write down, “I can’t think of anything else.” The fourth thing is, “Now I’m 
really frustrated that I can’t think of anything else,” so you write that 
down. What this does, especially by keeping the pen moving, is it stops the 
brain’s “editing function.” It stops the “judgment function” of the mind and 
allows it to be free enough to say whatever is there. That safety begins 
to open up a link or a channel to the creative energies that are deeper 
within the mind than the editing and judging functions. So out of two 
minutes, one might only come up sometimes with one decent idea, but 
that decent idea can then be developed.
These two steps often make it easier for the team to offer their ideas. But if 
people still need encouragement, be sure to give it to them. If an idea is rotten, 
so be it. There are infinite amounts of ideas, and only a handful will be good 
enough to take to the next level.
I like people to come to a Mastermind Intelligence session bursting with ideas, 
but it’s important for you to guide the conversation so as not to stray too far 
off course. Ask for attendees to come with a few big ideas already in mind, 
but don’t specify how many. For example, requiring people to bring at least 
three ideas to the table can feel too structured, especially if you expect them 
to be ready to fully express them. Then, the group can work together to dis-
cuss how or if the ideas fit into overall project goals. There are always some 
people in the room who are naturally more vocal, and if you ask them for an 
evaluation of what is being presented, they will usually open up and tell you 
what they really think. 

Chapter 5 | Mastermind Intelligence
76
Staying Open to Outlying Ideas
Many times, organizations fall into familiar patterns as they look for opportu-
nities to innovate. Some people tend to like traditional ideas because they are 
easier and safer to identify with. Unfortunately, when new ideas are outside of 
their particular comfort zone, some people may not be open to them. These 
“outliers” are the very ones that can lead to the greatest innovations, but 
those with closed or narrow minds are unable to see that.
Make sure you encourage all your attendees to be more willing to consider 
seemingly “out there” ideas. Bayer offers these suggestions to maximize 
­openness while facilitating a Mastermind Intelligence session:
Picture a coat checkroom in a nice restaurant during a cold winter. 
The idea behind the coat checkroom is for diners to identify what 
is not needed inside the restaurant, like an overcoat or topcoat, and 
then leave it behind. Like a coat checkroom, a good Mastermind 
facilitator will encourage everyone participating and present to 
check their attachments to their own ideas and to their static ways 
of thinking—to check them at the door, so to speak. . . . Entering 
the room of the Mastermind session freed and unencumbered by 
old and familiar ways of thinking enables creativity to truly emerge. 
It is crucial to not only check our negativity and leave it in the 
coatroom, but to allow everyone to contribute without judgment. 
To be without judgment is very important. If a person feels judged, 
especially in front of a superior, creativity gets squelched. In order 
for creativity to flow, people need to have a safe environment. The 
facilitator can create a safe atmosphere by instructing everyone to 
allow all ideas to be presented without any judgment or criticism.
Often old patterns of caution and hesitancy to share ideas openly block some 
participants from engaging freely in Mastermind practices. They believe that 
they should constantly censor themselves.
Bayer also advises to read aloud Mastermind “rules” at the beginning of a 
session:
The idea is not only [that you are] not supposed to censor anyone else’s 
ideas, you’re not even supposed to censor your own ideas. It is important 
to remember that creativity springs from a deeper place in one’s mind 
than does that of self-censorship. When we allow the ‘editing function’ to 
be checked at the door, we open the channel to the creative energies that 
exist deeper within the minds of every participant. 

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
77
Run Meetings with Patience
Every Mastermind session must be run with patience and leadership by 
­example. Start the session by generating all the ideas you possibly can, without 
any judgment or discussion.
Eventually, it will be time to decide which ideas are worth pursuing in the 
near term and which should be discarded, at least until the next business wide 
Mastermind Intelligence session.
In a typical meeting, an idea connects with half of the room almost instantly. 
This, in turn, may generate interest among everyone else. An idea that has 
value will quickly gain supporters.
Other times, an idea can get torn apart. When that happens, you have to be 
careful that the idea itself is being discussed, not the person who presented it. 
You never want people to feel like they are going to be attacked if they present 
an unpopular idea. That approach does not encourage open communication.
Sometimes, an idea that bombed in a meeting may actually have some merit, 
even after the session is over. Ask the person who presented it to spend 
more time assessing and developing the concept. While the original idea may 
not be used, often an offshoot of the idea will make far more sense and be 
much more valuable.
If you still need the confidence to speak out, draw your inspiration from 
­children. Younger thinkers are not yet inhibited by fear of failure or judgment, 
so they often produce fresher thinking. Even when the idea itself may not be 
workable in its original form, it may be what is needed to spawn something 
that does have “legs.” Inventions such as popsicles, earmuffs, and trampolines 
all started out as random musings of children that turned into practical items 
after more time, thought, and resources had been given to them.
The Next Step
Once you choose the ideas that you want to explore, your next step will be, 
just as in your Mastermind sessions, to brainstorm different ways to ­implement 
them. Eventually, a small group may be assembled to develop a more thorough 
proposal, but it could be valuable to take advantage of the existing Mastermind 
group to flesh things out. Someone may come up with a better idea than that 
generated by a more formal committee.
For example, if in your Mastermind Intelligence session you decide to ­partner 
with certain charities around a product launch, the next phase would be 
to brainstorm different kinds of events or strategies you could implement 
to make this plan happen. Then, the most popular of those ideas could be 
worked on by a committee.

Chapter 5 | Mastermind Intelligence
78
An “Asset Strategy” for Your New Project
Once your project is with an official committee, you’re past the idea stage. 
Part of your work going forward will be to come up with an implementation 
plan. But in order to be operating with your Business Mind, you also need to 
review as much data as possible to determine if the proposed strategy, which 
was most likely devised by the intuitive side of the brain, holds water with the 
analytical side of the brain.
Every vetting process is too different to delve into here. However, the odds are 
that one or more of the ideas that come from your Mastermind Intelligence 
session will need to be implemented. Sometimes the most difficult part of a 
new project is finding the right people to make it happen.
Gary Quinn has an interesting approach to this:
It doesn’t matter what role I have in a project. Based on the vision or 
strategy I need to implement, the first thing I have to do is look at what 
I have. What are my assets? When looking at a company, or division, or 
organization, the biggest challenge, most of the time, is people. Inventorying 
those people and finding out their capabilities is a challenge.
You’ve got to get through them one at the time, as best you can. Or you 
have to have people on your team that you can trust and know how you 
think. At the same time, you’re simultaneously forming or evolving your 
strategy. Then, you plug in the right people, the assets.
What I tell people to do is draw a picture on the board. Create empty 
boxes based on different roles you need. Then, go through all your assets 
and find the best place for them on the board. If necessary, obtain assets 
you need—put them in the right box. Move them into your organization.
As you’re working through this process, call into mind your experiences  
during the Mastermind Intelligence session with those who stood out as  
particularly enthusiastic, sensible, or intuitive about the idea now at hand. They 
might be just who you need now. Your project might be a career changer for 
them. “A lot of times when reviewing your assets, your people, you . . . find out 
that they’re in the wrong box,” says Quinn. “Especially if they’ve been in the 
company for a while, they may have been moved around and somehow they just 
got put in a place that’s not their strength. So you put them in a different box.” 
Fostering a Culture of Innovation
Ultimately, Mastermind Intelligence is about more than just creating a new 
set of ideas and implementation plans; it’s about cultivating a company culture 
where the atmosphere of brainstorming is realized year round. “When you 

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
79
start to feel safe in your job, with your boss, with your department, with your 
company, with your clients and so forth, then a greater sense of openness 
of thinking can occur,” says Bayer. “You’re not just looking to survive. You’re 
looking to thrive. If you’re just focusing, like so many people in business do on 
a daily basis, just on survival in the company . . . your mind gets stuck in very 
narrow places.”
Zak says that creating an environment of trust in an organization should be a 
priority. “One reason trust is important at work is because it liberates employ-
ees to take ownership of projects and be more innovative. If I’m an employee 
and I think I’m going to get punished if I try something that ultimately fails, 
then I’m not going to try it. But if I trust my supervisor to support me regard-
less, then I’m more likely to be more innovative.”
He says the best way to create a high-trust organization is to allow for errors, 
just like you allow the offbeat suggestions that come up in a brainstorming 
session.
“I sometimes call these ‘crowdsourcing mistakes.’ You want to have lots of 
employees doing lots of things. Some things will work better, some things 
don’t.”
Most important of all, adds Zak, is your own dependability. “If you’re going to 
build a high-trust organization,” he says, “then you, yourself, have to be trust-
worthy. It starts from the top.”
At the same time, Zak says that high trust doesn’t mean a lack of intensity. 
There has to be a mix. He says that places like Google make a practice of 
hiring quirky, divergent thinkers and elicit innovation by combining high trust 
with a certain amount of pressure. Trust creates oxytocin in the brain. “As 
oxytocin increases in the brain,” says Zak, “it actually reduces cardiovascular 
stress. You can actually see this relaxation. In the studies we’ve done, we’ve 
shown that there’s a sweet spot between this focused intensity arousal mea-
sures in the brain and the sense of relaxation as well. You need both. You 
need to be ‘focus relaxed’ or have a ‘relaxed focus.’ Leaders need to be think-
ing, ‘I don’t want to stress you out so much that you’re freaked out all the time 
and you can hardly think. Nor do I want to have you be so underengaged that 
you’re really not putting all your energy into the task at hand.’” 
Sweet Spot
Zak says there’s a sweet spot where employees are more productive and 
innovative. “They report more energy when they’re in that sweet spot. We 
have some evidence that they innovate better.”

Chapter 5 | Mastermind Intelligence
80
But from a neuroscience standpoint, the brain can’t stay in that sweet spot 
forever. “You need to create an on-and-off switch,” he says. “The brain has 
refractory periods. So you as the leader need to design a challenge, let people 
work on it and then step back and allow them to reset.”
Zak does this by setting project-based goals with obvious finish lines. The 
scientists who work for him clearly understand whether they’ve reached the 
goal or not. When they succeed, there’s a celebration in the form of a party, 
or a day off, plus a bit of breathing room while they ramp up for the next 
­challenge. “It’s about helping employees understand that the sweet spot is 
really a great place to be, but you’ve also got to step back and give them room 
to reset.”
Mastermind Intelligence Priorities
An implicit feature of a Mastermind Intelligence session is to leave your ego 
at the door. It’s not about you—it’s about the company. And the company 
is about the customers. If you want to implement a Mastermind Intelligence 
culture that fosters innovation, everyone will place the highest priority on the 
customer, then the company, then themselves.
Janet Wood, Executive Vice President of Talent and Leadership at SAP, a €16.8B 
software company, believes this is the right view for any employee to take, 
although she adds the layer of the team as an extension of the employee5:
“You cannot be wrong if the first thing you thought about was ‘What’s 
the impact on the customer?’” says Wood. “For me, that really helps put a 
­framework around how to make decisions. My second consideration is the 
company, or in my case SAP. . . . Then lastly is the team. Sometimes I need to 
have hard conversations with my team explaining that a decision that is more 
for the good of the company rather than the good of the team is still the right 
thing to do.”
When Wood was in an organization where the company’s products were 
sold via partners, she changed her focus to the partners. “If our partners are 
successful, then we know that they are servicing our customers in a way that 
we encourage,” she says. “When I was in charge of global system integrators, 
our partners were actually delivering the services. My company would sell 
the software, and then the partners did all of the implementation and busi-
ness transformation services. So if we are focusing on how we can make our 
partners the most successful, then by definition, we were also encouraging a 
better experience for our mutual customers.”

December 18, 2013.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind

Wood says that thinking this way helps her think strategically. “It helps me feel 
confident about the decisions I’ve made,” she says, “and I never have to worry 
about ‘Did I put myself or my team ahead of what’s best for the customer?’”
Clear Metrics
The organizations I’ve worked with have found Mastermind Intelligence to 
be extremely valuable. That’s why I’m detailing it here. Weaving Mastermind 
Intelligence into the heart of your corporate culture is a good idea in theory, 
but I’m also a strong believer in testing everything to make sure that, even if it 
works for someone else, it actually works for you.
It can be difficult to determine the impact that discussions of new ideas  
ultimately have on company performance. However, if you establish clear  
metrics for evaluating the success of implemented ideas, you will gain a big 
­picture of the value of Mastermind Intelligence practices. Methods for ­assessing 
the new projects and offerings include the following:
Exploring the experiences of similar companies with  
• 
similar approaches
Conducting trial runs and measuring results against 
• 
objectives
Monitoring what customers are saying about new 
• 
­products and services—for example, via social media
Analyzing the overall effect on market share
• 
You’ll also want to observe employee behavior and morale after major  
(or minor) company shifts. Plus, new changes could affect people, processes, 
technology, and information or result in the need for additional employee 
training. This data should be captured so you know what’s working and what 
might need some improvement.
In the following two chapters, I share engaging exercises to help you recognize 
key patterns and create strategy maps based on the Four Transformational 
Intelligences as discussed so far.

Pattern 
Recognition 
Sharpen Your Entire Business Mind
Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at 
things in a different way.
—Edward de Bono
Intelligence is the ability to take in information from the world and to find 
patterns in that information that allow you to organize your perceptions 
and understand the external world.
—Brian Greene
The preceding chapters of this book focused on thoughts. You learned about 
the Four Intelligences and how to orient your mind along those dimensions 
when thinking about business challenges. The final two chapters of this book 
are about action—specifically, what you can do to transform your business.
In this chapter, we’ll explore pattern recognition as it relates to business trans-
formation and the Four Intelligences. This chapter will provide information on 
ways for you to think like a detective—recognizing patterns of opportunities 
and challenges—to capture, interpret, relate, and transform.

Window of Possibilities
So, how can you use pattern recognition to sharpen your focus and alert your 
business mind to prepare for transformation?
First and foremost, you need to identify patterns that are present in ­certain 
events and trends that affect your business. Then, adjust your decisions 
accordingly. For example, through the application of pattern recognition tech-
niques, you can better understand your customers’ thought processes—why 
and how they buy, what is important to them, how they view you compared 
to your competition, what influences them, and so on. Once you better under-
stand your customers’ minds, you can revisit the steps described in Chapter 3 
and improve your Customer Intelligence.
Envision a line connecting your starting point and your targeted goal, with the 
line going through a window of possibilities, as shown in Figure 6-1. By ­peering 
out that window, creative, inspired, and imaginative ideas are in your grasp. 
However, the window may be foggy, dirty, and even broken at times, obscuring 
your view.
Figure 6-1. Window of possibilities
Your mind is essentially a window of possibilities. It can be creative and 
­innovative, but sometimes it fogs up and must be cleaned by clearing out old 
views and replacing them with fresh ones. Do you know how to recognize 
patterns of opportunity and turn your cloudy window into a clear one?
It is easier to make pattern recognition a way of life by observing other 
­people’s behavior. For example, let’s begin a meeting with ten colleagues by 
showing them printouts of the following three images:
Older woman wearing a red business jacket
• 
Older man wearing a sports jacket
• 
Red golf ball
• 

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
85
Ask each person which two of the three pictures belong together and why. 
The why is key to truly understanding the thought process behind the way 
your team subconsciously correlates information. Here are different group-
ings you might hear:
Woman and man—because of age range
• 
Woman and man—because of the jacket
• 
Woman and golf ball—because of the color red
• 
Man and golf ball—because of sport
• 
You will notice that the focus on which relationships are most important  
varies greatly. Also observe how people relate to the objects based on their 
own personal experience or interests. For example, if I like the color red, 
I might pay more attention to the images of the woman and the golf ball. 
Sometimes, to learn about your own patterns, you must examine someone 
else’s.
During meetings, notice your colleagues’ reactions to new opportunities and 
note which group they fall into:
1.	 Protectors—cautious players; point out the potential 
risks and possible impacts that could occur
2.	 Optimists—visionaries; willing to explore, take risks, and 
offer suggestions and solutions
3.	 Pessimists—naysayers; first thing out of their mouth is 
“no” until required to act
How about the way they sort information? Do they sort by food, color, people, 
music, movies, and so on? For example, my mother noticed a while ago that 
I use restaurants as landmarks when giving directions, which demonstrates a 
way that I sort pertinent information. Something else I have noticed about 
myself is that I sort people by astrology signs. I did it for entertainment and 
conversation’s sake when I was much younger, and now it is a subconscious 
behavior. Everybody has something. It is just how our minds work.
Pay attention to sorting patterns. Remember, be inquisitive but not judgmen-
tal with what you observe. What motivates someone and causes their eyes 
to light up? Hone your observation skills by taking notes and evaluating how 
you see patterns in others. Then, observe patterns in your own behavior. It 
doesn’t have to be a major discovery. It could be something small, like noticing 
that you tend to be more proactive in the mornings than in the afternoons. 
Try to spend some time each day in reflective thought on looking for patterns, 
making it a habit that readily comes to you. The activity will shift from your 
conscious mind to your subconscious mind, which is the goal.

Chapter 6 | Pattern Recognition 
86
Recognizing Patterns
Why is it that some people miss opportunities that are right in front of them, 
whereas others recognize them immediately and take action?
Generally, the latter are positive go-getters, with a “let’s see what is possible” 
mentality and can-do attitude. They attract possibilities and opportunities. 
These are people that have trained their brains to notice patterns and oppor-
tunities, perhaps unconsciously, through repeated focus and awareness.
When preparing to transform a business, look for patterns prior to beginning 
that could help you determine which actions to take. These patterns may be 
within your business, or they may occur outside of it. Train your brain to scan 
for possibilities brought on by external changes. As we discussed, constant 
repetition will create an unconscious habit so that eventually you will be doing 
this without even being aware of it. Start by taking notice of what has changed 
outside of your business. Is there a pattern to this activity? What are the 
media and industry analysts paying attention to? What trends are happening?
Then, note the patterns that are occurring inside your business. Perhaps you’ll 
notice a pattern in the demands your customers are making. Go through your 
customer support feedback. What are customers asking for? Is it something 
you can support, change, or alter? Do you notice a direct correlation between 
what your customers are asking for and what is happening in the market? 
Sometimes there’s a clear-cut pattern, but plenty of times there isn’t.
Consider how the online flower order service developed. A number of  
factors paved the way for this opportunity:
Increased demands in work and lifestyles led to lack of 
• 
time for friends and family
Vast increase in the number of personal computers
• 
Development of software that could track customer 
• 
information, including key event reminders, such as birth-
days and anniversaries
Creation of mechanisms to transmit secure financial 
• 
details over the Internet
The flower shop industry didn’t notice these patterns all at once, but gradually, 
over time. Business decision makers often recognize one or two variables at  
a time that eventually lead to a solid, actionable pattern. Comments like,  

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
87
“I think I might have something” or “There is something there, but I am not 
quite sure what” should trigger further investigation. Customer complaints 
can also fall into that category, such as the following:
5:00 PM closing times at flower shops doesn’t give  
• 
customers enough time to get to the shop after work.
Customers are not satisfied since they can’t actually see 
• 
what they ordered over the phone.
There is often miscommunication about orders, delivery 
• 
dates, and recipient addresses.
As you can discern from the sample complaints above, connections may be 
made one at a time, while unfolding into an overarching pattern. This pattern 
can be shaped into a realized action plan, thanks to time, teamwork, open 
minds, and creativity.
Unfog the Window of Possibilities That Leads to 
Transformation
Due to the cloudiness of their perception, people do not always fully realize all 
of the facets of a possibility. Recall the concept represented by Figure 6-1. You 
may view possibilities out of your window, but unless your focus is clear, you 
will leave opportunities on the proverbial table. Work to uncover as much 
information as possible, and then evaluate, refine, and redirect. The process 
is never complete and continues to evolve. This is how businesses trans-
form. For example, the floral industry looked for opportunities to up-sell and  
subsequently began selling chocolates, stuffed animals, balloons, gift baskets, 
and more. They then partnered with or acquired complementary companies 
and made deals with shipping companies and local florists to expand their 
reach. But, it won’t stop there. They can look into loyalty reward programs, 
create mobile apps for ease of ordering, and use social media to drive more 
traffic and sales.
As opportunity assessments are conducted and information is uncovered on 
the path to transformation, business leaders must allow flexibility when the 
need arises to veer from the path in order to maximize possibilities.
Identify, Observe, Examine, and Assess
As we’ve discussed, it can be easier to recognize patterns in others before you 
can recognize them in yourself. If you’re married, just think about the patterns 
you’ve observed in your spouse, and vice versa. This also holds true when 
identifying business patterns, both internally and externally.

Chapter 6 | Pattern Recognition 
88
There are three main steps to follow when employing pattern recognition to 
transform your business:
1.	 Identify external events and trends. Start by taking 
note of events and trends happening outside of your 
­company. Think about key changes in technology, ­markets, 
­demographics, and other relevant areas. Also, think about 
your team’s social connections. Has your network been 
growing at a good pace? The more people you have 
­relationships with, the more opportunities you can ­identify. 
Don’t forget to ask your business partners what ­external 
events and trends they are noticing—and if they are  
acting on any.
2.	 Observe internal patterns of issues and complaints. Are 
there issues that come up again and again? Is there any 
relationship between the types of complaints and issues 
that are happening? What is the root cause? What areas 
need your attention?
3.	 Examine and assess any links between seemingly  
unrelated events or trends. Are there any dots between 
steps 1 and 2 that you might be able to connect?
These steps, however, are not definitive. Sometimes an individual or team 
recognizes an internal pattern before identifying an external event or trend.  
If you are starting from scratch, however, these steps are useful to follow.
Leverage Your Human Assets
Everyone on your team has a different background. When you are looking 
for patterns, particularly external to your company, make use of whatever 
extra knowledge or context your team members can provide. For example,  
perhaps someone on your team has experience in the legal field. Leverage 
these special skills by encouraging this individual to focus on aspects on the 
project relating to legal affairs. That extra input could be the difference in 
turning an identified opportunity into a realized goal.
A “dream team” with a broad range of experience can also bring greater 
value when recognizing patterns and assessing opportunities. The broader the 
knowledge, the greater the chances to connect the dots between events or 
trends, especially those that are not easily noticeable. 

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind

Jumping to Conclusions
Nothing is more frustrating than being on the phone with a customer service 
representative who is not truly listening to your concerns. He might ­interrupt 
you midsentence with a quick-fix solution to the issue he assumes you have, 
when your problem is something else entirely. You may then think he is  
rude and impatient. But why do some service representatives have poor 
­listening skills?
As I mentioned in Chapter 1, the neocortex part of our brain predicts what we 
will encounter based on data it has previously captured through our ­various 
senses. This information leads us to automatically assume what will occur in 
the future. The brains of many people you communicate with are constantly 
in preparation mode, predicting what you are going to say and do next. That 
is why the customer service representative interrupted you. He assumed to 
know your question based on patterns that his neocortex recognized. These 
patterns take the form of keywords and phrases that you use when you call 
in, such as “I am having trouble logging in.” Based on that phrase, the customer 
service representative might assume you have forgotten your password, which 
may or may not be the case.
Your brain does the very same thing when looking for possibilities or facing 
new situations. It makes assumptions based on prior experiences. It makes 
judgments about a pattern that has been recognized. That judgment or 
assumption could be entirely wrong, but the brain is trained to relate new 
information to that captured by your past experiences. When dealing with 
large amounts of data, the brain jumps to conclusions quickly. 
If you are alert to the fact that your mind is likely to make unproven assump-
tions, you can train yourself to slow down and be aware when it happens. 
Here’s how:
1.	 Take your time when reviewing data.
2.	 Notice when you are making an assumption. Write  
it down.
3.	 Ask yourself, “Is this true? Does the material I’m looking 
at right now really support this assumption, or am I refer-
ring to an experience from the past?”
4.	 Ask yourself, “Are there other possible meanings here 
that I may be ignoring when I make this assumption?”
5.	 Look at the data again and see if you notice something 
different.

Chapter 6 | Pattern Recognition

Focus Requires Balance
There is a balancing component to effective focus. When you focus too much 
on one thing, you may miss other opportunities. The key is to focus on your 
target while simultaneously keeping an open mind.
Also, when your focus is too intense, you tend to feel stress. Focusing on 
the outcome is good, but give yourself space for spontaneous ideas that may 
offer a different path to your outcome. A softer focus will make it easier for 
­creativity and innovation to emerge. Make sure that your confidence in know-
ing what you want is balanced by your comfort in not being exactly sure how 
to get there. Success often comes when you make room for “not knowing.”
To bring about true transformation, you must garner the support of your 
­subconscious mind. You need a vision of the outcome to energize your mind 
and body so you can propel yourself in the direction of change. You can 
achieve what you want more easily, effortlessly, and less stressfully when your 
conscious and subconscious mind work together toward a common goal. 
Stumbling on Ideas
Looking for the next big opportunity shouldn’t be stressful. The key is to take 
small steps, possibly starting with a little hop. You most likely will stumble 
on something you never imagined before you got started on your journey. 
This unexpected stumbling often turns out to lead to the most wonderful 
transformative possibilities for your business. All you have to do is be alert 
and have an open mind while you’re searching. This is the way people stumble 
onto ideas.
Small and Manageable 
Make sure not to put too much pressure on yourself and your team to find the 
next big thing. The small possibilities are often the ones that make the biggest 
impact. Don’t rule out smaller scale opportunities that are more manageable 
and can be implemented in a shorter time period. Implementation requires 
resources, funds, and time. Also, when we postpone or delay smaller oppor-
tunities while trying to implement larger ones, other factors may change. For 
example, a bigger opportunity may only be fully implemented three years after 
the initial pattern was identified. Within that time period, a lot can change, 
potentially negating some of the value of the original opportunity. Start small 
and build incrementally.
For example, let’s revisit our small florist. Pretend our small shop is cur-
rently mailing out catalogs that showcase beautiful floral arrangement designs.  
But, some of the flower arrangements might be discontinued or unavailable 

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
91
by the time a customer decides to call and place a phone order, leading to 
customer dissatisfaction. A way to remedy this problem is for the florist to 
go from a catalog-based business to a web-based business, which can handle 
requests and update product information in real time. Realistically though, 
this is a huge goal that could be a few years off. Instead, florists could begin 
by experimenting with a simple, informational web site about the availability 
of various floral arrangements. They can progress to a transactional web site 
that would include a shopping cart and order tracking. This would allow them 
to test the site, work out the kinks, and then continue to the next possibility.
Delta of Possibilities
Let’s envision that you and your team have used your business minds to 
­identify an exciting opportunity. Now you want to assess if it makes sense for 
your business to take the plunge and pursue it.
Start by evaluating your current state and then determine what your target 
is. The difference between the two is your “delta of possibilities.” Picture 
again the window of possibilities in Figure 6-1. Prepare to look through this 
window—assess and analyze if the possibility is doable.
Using the lens of the Four Intelligences, we could see our humble florist’s cur-
rent state as being hallmarked by the following:
Financial Intelligence > Declining Revenue
• 
Customer Intelligence > Order Complaints
• 
Data Intelligence > Lack of Order Tracking System
• 
Mastermind Intelligence > Miscommunication; Lack of 
• 
Training and Motivation
Using the same view, the florist’s targeted goals could be the following:
Financial Intelligence > Increased Revenue
• 
Customer Intelligence > Web-Ordering Mechanism; 
• 
Customer Satisfaction
Data Intelligence > Online Order Tracking System
• 
Mastermind Intelligence > Increase in Productivity; Alert 
• 
and Focused
To reach the desired targets, you must work backward using the Four 
Intelligences. For example, you could work on the issue of internal 
­miscommunication first. What is it going to take to turn things around so 
that communication is a positive experience? Using Mastermind Intelligence, 
engage your employees and your team to look for creative solutions.  

Chapter 6 | Pattern Recognition 
92
From there, use similar Mastermind Intelligence techniques to tackle the lack 
of an order tracking system. You’ll note that there are lots of synergies to 
be realized among your various goals. Implementation of an order tracking 
system would also improve your Data Intelligence. Then, switch to Customer 
Intelligence needs. What do your customers need? Use these insights to put 
together a web-interfacing ordering application that will improve customer 
satisfaction. Next, set up a process to track the data you need to measure  
progress against your goal of increased revenue. This step falls under the 
umbrella of Financial Intelligence. To help you visually encode this ­process, 
I have drawn out an image of showing where you currently are (Step #1), 
the action process phase (Step #2), and the target (Step #3), shown in 
Figure 6-2.
Advanced Pattern Recognition Techniques
Businesses can also use data-modeling and data-mining techniques to  
recognize patterns within large sets of data. This is beneficial when identi-
fied opportunities involve big data and predictive analytics. Data modeling can 
provide visuals about the organization’s data, and it allows for collaboration 
across the enterprise. It is also a helpful tool to use when working on service 
level agreements (SLAs) by painting a picture of what data currently exists and 
where. It also provides a glimpse into what data is missing and what data is 
needed, for planning purposes.
Figure 6-2.  Current, action, target

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
93
In Chapter 4, we discussed the need to create universal, clear definitions of 
various data across an organization and then ensure that these definitions are 
shared and encoded throughout the company through training and repetition. 
To take that concept further, metadata is data about the data or information 
about the information. It’s confusing, I know. Think of it as a professional bio 
for your data, capturing key facts such as who can access it, who owns it, who 
uses it, and where it comes from. Management of metadata information can be 
found in a data model tool. This is particularly helpful when addressing gover-
nance, security, risk, compliance, audit, and legal concerns because it ensures 
that all your ducks are in a row.
Intelligence Hub
Use the intelligence hub discussed in Chapter 4 to centrally manage gover-
nance, risk, and compliance. In other words, designate a central location in 
your organization to oversee major transformational activities. From a bird’s 
eye view, the hub can manage any potential, unintended impacts your project 
may have in another area of the organization. For example, if you are trans-
forming the HR department, an intelligence hub would cross-check to make 
sure there is no impact in the finance or marketing department.
The intelligence hub houses the unified definitions, processes, and enterprise 
wide data oversight functions, and it functions as the central repository of 
information flow. The mission of the intelligence hub is to make sure the com-
pany’s vision, strategies, plans, and processes work in harmony. For example, 
a centralized view of governance practices allows for effective and efficient 
management of performance, as well as awareness of risk and compliance. 
Transformational Strategy
Patterns are around us every day. Once you learn to open your mind and 
recognize patterns, you will then be able to determine how to make patterns 
contribute to the success of your business. You will also recognize the need 
to train your brain to explore the possibilities identified by your newfound 
skill and ensure the “Window of Possibilities” in your mind is crystal clear, 
clean, and wide open to whatever is out there.

Strategy Mapping 
Integrating the Four Intelligences  
into Your Business
Strategy is a pattern in a stream of decisions.

What’s the use of measuring speed if you don’t go in the right direction?
–Jeroen De Flander
I hope at this point in the book your wheels are turning and you’re beginning 
to ponder the opportunities using the Four Intelligences in your own 
company. After determining your destination (that is, your strategy), you then 
need to program the GPS or your navigation system (strategy map) to get 
there as smoothly as possible.
However, the art of strategy mapping is more than just improving 
performance; it must involve doing things differently. A well thought-out 
map empowers many people, not only leaders, to use the data to effect 
change. This chapter will guide you in the creation of strategy maps for your 
own organization. Strategy maps devised following this process will also help 
you identify any key data or patterns overlooked earlier in your opportunity 
development process.

Strategy Mapping
Strategy maps set metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that indicate 
how an organization is performing against strategic goals and objectives, as 
well as in relation to the overall vision and strategy of an organization.
Businesses using the Four Intelligences actively collect and monitor relevant 
data about their processes in order to make informed decisions. The Four 
Intelligences also help position decision makers to swiftly respond to changes 
in markets, competitors, trends, and customers. Most people equate success 
with receiving mountains of data, but this notion is wrong. Success is about 
having the right data—balanced data that is focused on the areas your orga-
nization is looking to improve. The data output from the Four Intelligences 
becomes the data input for the strategy map, as shown in Figure 7-1.

Ingredients of a Strategy Map
As we know, life isn’t all about opportunities. It’s often about challenges. We 
must face challenges in the same way that we face opportunities. The intent is 
to find solutions. Using the Four Intelligences, your organization can also find 
solutions to challenges by using a strategy map. Figure 7-2 shows you the key 
ingredients of a strategy map.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
97
If the map seems daunting, don’t worry. You have the ingredients already in 
your cupboard, as they are the outputs from the Four Intelligences. These 
data outputs will then become the inputs for your strategy map. Let’s take a 
closer look at each one.
#1—Strategic Objective
Strategic objectives are derived from the vision and strategy of the organization. 
The purpose of including these objectives in a strategy map is to redirect the 
organization from the tyranny of maintaining the status quo with only slight 
improvements here and there. If an organization does not constantly change, 
it is at risk because its competitors might offer similar products or services. 
In short, strategic objectives define the changes an organization should make 
to maintain a competitive edge.
Everyone in the company must understand the overall corporate goals and 
objectives and how each specific job relates to achieving them. Companies 
need to communicate down through the organization when setting goals and 
objectives.

answering these questions:
Who is 
• 
responsible for working on the activity and 
making sure the job is done correctly?
Who has ultimate

Figure 7-3.  Sample RACI matrix
If you are using a system to track and document your strategy map, like the 
one shown in Figure 7-4, make sure that it includes assignees and all related 
parties. Assignees are those assigned to execute a strategic objective or ini-
tiative and are generally your staff. For example, corporate compliance might 
need participation from finance, general counsel, and paralegals. These par-
ticipants could be defined as those individuals who are responsible and/or 
accountable, based on the RACI matrix.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind

Involved parties may be external or internal to the organization. Examples 
of external parties could be contractors, subject matter experts, or audi-
tors. Internal parties may consist of steering committee members, human 
resources, or marketing. In summary, an involved party can be defined as any-
one who is consulted or informed based on the RACI matrix.
#2—Set Priorities
Setting priorities should be done on a consistent basis. Some people might 
order priorities based on what they can finish the most quickly. Others may 
choose items that use the fewer number of resources or require the least risk.
Just as you created universal definitions of data, you must also create defini-
tions when setting priorities. To apply a formal approach to prioritization, it 
is helpful to perform a SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat) 
analysis. Opportunities are external, while strength is internal. Try to find the 
balance of your greatest strength/opportunity with your realized weaknesses 
and present threats and set priorities accordingly.
Imagine you have two objectives at a given time:
1.	 Consolidation of two departments, such as HR and Legal
2.	 Establishment of financial compliance for entry on the 
New York Stock Exchange
Figure 7-4.  Example of a strategy map tracking system, including assigned and related parties

Chapter 7 | Strategy Mapping 
100
Which objective should you place as highest priority? In order to determine 
this, a SWOT analysis is essential, as shown in Figure 7-5. The following ques-
tions will guide your analysis:
Strength (internal): Do I already have best practices and 
• 
framework established elsewhere that can be reused?
Weakness (internal): Do I have the necessary resources 
• 
and skills available internally or do I need to outsource?
Opportunity (external): Will this benefit our customers 
• 
and drive more business?
Threat (external): Is there a factor driving this such as an 
• 
audit, competition, or a legal mandate?

It is important to keep in mind that actions taken to address a weakness or 
threat are non-transformative, while objectives based on strengths or oppor-
tunities are transformative in nature.

#3—Measures, Metrics, and KPIs
Let’s start with a quick, broad definition of each of these three terms:
• 
Measure: A one-time sum such as the number of 
employees you hired in January
• 
Metric: Two or more measurements, often over a period 
of time, such as the number of employees you hired per 
month during the fiscal calendar year
• 
Key Performance Indicator (KPI): A comparison, 
usually compared to a target, such as your targeted goal 
for new employees during the fiscal calendar year com-
pared to the number of employees you actually hired
When establishing measures, metrics, and KPIs, it is important to have com-
mon definitions of these terms across the team or the organization. Imagine 
tracking performance when there is not a unified definition of what is being 
measured. Each company is different and, therefore, you should select mea-
sures, metrics, and KPIs that are appropriate for you.
Another point of confusion within organizations is the difference between a 
metric and KPI. Although I covered it in the first part of this book, let’s make 
things clearer using an example of plastic surgeons.
Plastic surgeons have their own metrics to measure their business success:
Total number of patients
• 
Total number of satisfied patients
• 
Total number of repeat patients
• 
Total number of referrals
• 
The KPIs that plastic surgeons might track could be the total number of 
patient appointments as a result of the following:
Advertisements in magazines
• 
Mentions on 
• 
The Oprah Winfrey Show or The Dr. Oz Show
Plastic surgeon’s newly published book
• 
The key to appropriately defining measures, metrics, and KPIs is to capture the 
right data and to present it in terms that are relevant to your business. Then, 
you need to communicate and translate the data into a meaningful and useful 
language so that all parties can relate to it no matter what department they 
may be in or role they might have.

Chapter 7 | Strategy Mapping 
102
Once you have determined what measures, metrics, and KPIs you will be using 
for your business, here’s what else you have to do:
Document your definitions, formulae, and unit types for 
• 
each of these items
Communicate each of these items to everyone involved
• 
Get feedback to ensure everyone understands your defi-
• 
nitions and can work with your parameters
Make any necessary changes after getting feedback
• 
For example, a typical cluster of project-related metrics might include 
these elements:
Metric Name: percentage of active projects on time
• 
Metric Definition: percentage of projects performed 
• 
within the planned timeframe per baseline
Metric Formula: percentage of number of active proj-
• 
ects delivered on time based on total number of active 
projects
Metric Unit Type: percentage
• 
If clear definitions are not established, decisions makers will not be able to 
reliably report whether their company is making progress in areas of impor-
tance to the board of directors, shareholders, customers, employees, and the 
community at large. Sometimes an outside consultant is needed to help iden-
tify, define, and bring synergy to your measures, metrics, and KPIs.
#4—Data Sources
Do you have an enterprise-wide view of all your data sources?
If your objective or initiative is related to data consolidation across depart-
ments or the organization, then you might be integrating disparate data sources. 
You need to understand where data are coming from. If you must synchronize 
data from different systems that use different formats, field names, or data 
characteristics, you need to ensure that you have consistent data sources for 
your application systems.
Data modeling can help you to interpret and understand the data sources, 
data types, and data locations to include in your strategy map. It will also let 
you know where to look if the need to modify, create, and/or manage data 
arises.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
103
#5—SLA Targets
With any new or revised strategic objective, establishing a formal service level 
agreement (SLA) is significant. It brings parties together to share, brainstorm, 
and document appropriate expectations. Best of all, it helps establish targets. 
Targets are critical in bringing focus and clarity so that an organization can 
make improvements. A target, if communicated appropriately, can be used as a 
motivational and positive reinforcement technique. Make sure everyone agrees 
on the targets and expected performance. You could even use a red, yellow, 
and green dashboard, for example, to track your team’s progress in reaching 
your target based on actual values against the targeted values. This allows you 
to periodically check the status to make necessary adjustments as needed.
The formality of an SLA should be looked at as a means of communication, not 
a method for penalizing or measuring someone’s performance. It should reflect 
the discussions that occur among the staff, managers, and executives, followed by 
the expectations and negotiated points set among internal departments and/or 
between internal and external parties. Drawing up a formal SLA brings attention 
to issues and lessons learned, and it also increases the probability for consistent 
improvements to occur while expected service levels are being addressed.
Having a formal SLA also sets a level of priority and understanding for the 
provider, based on what is of most importance to the client. Formalizing the 
SLA alleviates fear and assures the business units and clients that their strategic 
and tactical objectives will be met.
For an external service provider, the penalty clause within an SLA is an incen-
tive to maintain a certain level of service; otherwise, there is financial liability. 
If the provider fails to meet the outlined service level requirements, they 
must compensate the client accordingly. However, not all penalty clauses 
include financial punitive measures to mitigate the lack of SLA requirements, 
which makes it critically important to outline and negotiate specific details 
within the SLA that all parties can agree to and reasonably meet. A formal 
SLA creates a professional business relationship with the client, even if they 
are internal, thus creating a more productive environment.
Preparing for Formal SLAs
There are several considerations when preparing formal SLAs. The following 
are the main ones to explore:
• 
Executive Sponsorship: Make sure there is an executive 
sponsor involved if you are not one. It is up to execu-
tive leadership, executive sponsors, and senior manage-
ment to stress the importance of formal internal SLAs. 
As the sponsor, you need to help paint the bigger picture, 
emphasizing that the SLA improves communication and 
that it is not a method to measure performance.

Chapter 7 | Strategy Mapping 
104
• 
Involve the Appropriate Parties: Make sure you identify  
and bring all parties involved to the table so that the 
business, technical, and legal perspectives are considered. 
SLAs are not just for IT—SLAs can be for the financial, 
HR, sales, marketing, and other departments. In addition 
to involving the legal department, some organizations 
need to involve the administrative teams as well. Make 
sure to involve day-to-day supervisory management staff 
that will be directly affected by the performance stan-
dards established with the SLA requirements; they are 
best able to provide input based on their roles.
• 
Review Strategic Objectives: It is best when the strategic  
objective of the organization is reviewed with the team so 
that everyone understands the goals and mission. Again, 
connect and coordinate. If there are any current measures, 
metrics, and KPIs being used, bring those to the table to 
be discussed. Note that IT service metrics will be different 
from HR, financial, and other metrics. In addition, consider 
new metrics based on what others in your industry are 
doing in a similar environment. You want to make sure 
there is not an overload of metrics being captured, but a 
sufficient amount to fulfill the business objective.
• 
Apply to Executive Needs (Higher Picture): When 
gathering requirements for a formal SLA, it is best to link 
it to a performance management improvement project 
in order to evaluate which metrics are important for the 
executive when he or she makes business decisions. If you  
find that the necessary information is not being captured, 
you will better be able to evaluate your data governance 
needs and requirements.
• 
Duration and Review Timeline: SLAs should have an 
established term. It is also best to reevaluate an SLA at a 
set interval, or during the budgeting process for the coming  
year, to determine commitment levels and budgets, if 
applicable. The agreements will change as demands and 
requirements change (new policies, new processes, new 
mandates and regulations that need to be met, and so on).
• 
Don’t Create an Issue out of a Non-Issue: When 
gathering SLA requirements, make sure you don’t create 
an issue out of a non-issue. For example, if scheduled 
downtime is not important, don’t include it as part of 
the SLA. Address the real problem areas where there 
is a need for process improvement. Be cautious not to 
overmeasure. Stay focused on the target.

#6—Internal and External Data
Review your internal and external data against your strategic objectives. 
Brainstorm and discuss these questions:
What data is being captured?
• 
What data is missing, and how can you get it?
• 
What data is obsolete? What will you do with it while 
• 
remaining compliant with internal or external monitoring 
organizations? Will you store it, purge it, or delete it?
What data is being captured by the marketplace and your 
• 
competitors?
What external factors could impact this initiative? These 
• 
factors could be anything from unemployment rates to gas 
prices to the housing market, as well as any market trends.
Take Action!
As we move to the final section of this book, I want to encourage you to take 
action and create one simple strategy map as part of your day-to-day work/
life activity. In doing so, you will start to form a habit that will impact your next 
major business transformation opportunity.
Your practice strategy maps should be based on one simple strategic goal of 
your choosing, highlighting two or three metrics and KPIs, targets, and possi-
ble external data to be captured. Over time, you will draft additional versions 
of more complex strategy mappings. But for now, at least, walk through the 
steps for one general strategic objective with a small group or team.
Step 1—Gather and Organize
Use elicitation techniques to understand and capture requirements such as sur-
veys, interviews, shadowing, brainstorming, or analysis of existing documents.
Step 2—Analyze and Validate
In order to ensure quality and integrity of your input, analyze and validate the 
data you have collected. Link back and check to see if the method for obtain-
ing the data makes sense and fulfills the purpose of the strategic objective. I 
once had a data architect tell me that the data source of a metric came from 
a PowerPoint he had received. That made me question his credibility as a 
data architect. I then pointed out that the PowerPoint content was based on 
data derived from “elsewhere” and asked him to identify exactly where that 
“elsewhere” was.

Chapter 7 | Strategy Mapping 
106
As shown in Figure 7-6, the data you collected then becomes the input for 
your strategy map. When analyzing and validating data, assess the impacts on 
other projects or initiatives.

Step 3—Collaborate and Communicate
Next, input the data from each of the Four Transformational Intelligences into 
the strategy map, as shown in Figure 7-7. Then, communicate and collaborate 
accordingly with your team.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
107
What are your department’s best practices for staying engaged with the rest of 
your organization so that both the department and company can be mutually 
responsive to each other’s needs? At this point in the process, use the assignees 
and parties identified in the RACI matrix to communicate and collaborate. 
Confirm that everyone agrees that the targets are achievable and can 
realistically be performed. It is important at this step to have agreement and 
approval on targets before you move on.
Step 4—Document and Relate
Now that you have confirmation and approval, it is time to document and link 
the data captured together. A typical strategy map template may be conve-
niently broken down into seven columns, as follows:
Column 1—Insert the strategic objective for each Intelligence
• 
Column 2—Set and organize priorities
• 
Column 3—Include measures, metrics, and KPIs
• 
Column 4—Identify data sources
• 
Column 5—Insert agreed target levels
• 
Column 6—Examine the results of internal and external data
• 
A seventh column might be titled “Strategic Initiative/Action.” These column 
heads serve as action programs or ways to achieve the targets. You then 
write down the findings that will enable you to meet the target for a specific 
strategic objective in the columns. For example, the end result could be that

the company should make a specific investment or launch a certain marketing 
campaign. This is actionable activity. Sometimes these actionable activities can 
become another strategic objective.
Cause-and-Effect Relationships
Once you create your strategy map, you then link, or relate, it to a strategic 
initiative and its actionable activities. For example, look at the strategic initia-
tive for a hotel sorted by the Four Intelligences:
Financial Intelligence > Action is to grow revenues
• 
Customer Intelligence > Action is to increase quality of 
• 
customer experience
Data Intelligence > Action is to improve technology 
• 
systems
Mastermind Intelligence > Action is to enhance employee 
• 
processes
You then can link the Four Transformational Intelligences together based on 
your results from the strategy map, as show in Table 7-1, and you use your busi-
ness mind to determine reasonable action steps to take based on the strategic 
initiatives. Now loop back and apply the Four Transformational Intelligences.

You can see from Table 7-1 that if a hotel’s financial initiative is to grow rev-
enues, one way they can do this is to invest in activities to increase the quality 
of the customer experience. This investment will gain repeat customers and 
generate positive word-of-mouth publicity. In order to perform this Customer 
Intelligence strategic initiative, the hotel must invest in better check-in and 
check-out systems, new and upgraded mattresses, complimentary shuttle 
services, and advanced technology services for guests (free Wi-Fi connections 
and movies on demand). To accomplish all of those tasks, innovative and 
creative employees are needed to drive the input. For the target of enriching 
the reservation process, hospitality training should strive to make a memorable 
experience for guests, creating the need for innovation.
A state university provides another example. A state university generally 
focuses on growth of student enrollment and the number of programs offered. 
These growth calculations are reflected annually or biannually in state funding 
formulas. State funds are then used to stimulate and support new programs 
and new facilities. Based on this information, what are some examples of 
reasonable activities you could come up with to transform a state university? 
In Table 7-2, I share some examples of targets to increase enrollment.

Now let’s assume you work for the state university, which has a wonderful 
dance department. To increase enrollment, you launch a marketing campaign 
about the dance program and include famous dancers who are alumni. You 
feel this will be effective since you’ve noticed a spike in interest in dance as 
a result of TV shows such as Dancing with the Stars and So You Think You Can 
Dance? You then track the campaign’s effectiveness using KPIs to see how 
many students enroll in the university’s dance program because of these 
marketplace changes. As a result of the success of this campaign, another 
strategic objective is created to implement big data within the university. The 
intention of big data is to predict areas of interest, determine enrollment 
peaks, and identify other trends that drive short-term marketing campaigns.

among the Four Intelligences. Many times, you can improve initiatives by looking

Monitor and Refine
Monitor and observe both internal and external patterns. What can be changed 
or modified? What needs to be improved? What’s working? What’s not?
As you modify or change your strategy map, do so incrementally. Don’t try to  
create anything from scratch or recreate strategy maps for the entire organization at 
once. Small steps can have big impacts. Start by refining one step, and then expand 
and take two or more steps. Keep in mind that a strategy map is not a fixed plan. 
It is an ongoing journey that helps guide the transformation of the business.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
111
If you decide to use a strategy map tracking system, make sure it has a dash-
board so you can easily see your top three to five metrics and/or KPIs. This 
will help you notice and modify patterns and also help you identify the root 
cause of issues that arise. A dashboard might, for example, address simple 
project-related metrics such as the following:
Number of open projects
• 
Number of open tasks
• 
Number of critical alerts
• 
Number of in-progress statuses
• 
The Output of a Strategy Map
A strategy map helps you define what you need, when you need it, and how you 
are going to achieve it. How do you know if your organization needs big data 
without implementing a strategy map? The same is true for cloud computing, 
mobility, outsourcing, software-as-a-service (SaaS), web intelligence, and much 
more. Often we purchase and apply what we think is a solution without 
analyzing what the actual issue is that we’re trying to solve. It is like taking an 
aspirin to ease your headache even though your headache may be the result 
of caffeine withdrawal, a brain tumor, or another medical condition. Regardless 
of the issue, that aspirin could only be a temporary fix until a doctor provides 
you with a proper diagnosis.
A strategy map will continually help you solve the problems you are actually trying 
to solve because it is a dynamic, ever-changing tool. Executives using strategy 
maps can adeptly shift directions based on new insights and observations.
Also, the output of a strategy map is used as the input for the following:
Gap analysis
• 
Project implementation
• 
Preparation for governance, risk management, compli-
• 
ance (GRC), and legal matters
Framework and certification planning such as Data 
• 
Governance, ITIL, Six Sigma, and Lean
Reporting tools such as scoreboards and dashboards
• 
Remember to revisit the beginning of this book, review your thoughts, and 
apply the Four Transformational Intelligences to other areas of your business. 
You now know how to use your business mindset and find patterns to make 
lasting, impactful changes.

112
Evaluation
I use five criteria to evaluate the success of an approved strategy map. 
You can use these criteria to evaluate an already created strategy map, or you 
can evaluate it while you are still in the process of implementing it:
1.	 Is the target being met? Did the result provide the 
expected planned outcome?
2.	 Is the organization able to maintain or enhance the 
mapped strategy over a period of time, or does it need 
to retract?
3.	 Are all parties, both those who created the map and those 
involved in its implementation, enthusiastic and positive 
about the long-term potential?
4.	 Does the strategy map complement other strategic goals 
of the organization?
5.	 Is the strategy map flexible enough to be modified or refined?
Use these criteria or develop additional ones as you see fit for your organization.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Q: How do you define a successful strategy map?
A: Before you can measure success, you must have a clear 
• 
vision of what constitutes success in your organization 
and your industry. Compare the identity and reputation 
of your organization with that of the overall marketplace 
and your competitors.
Q: How should these strategy maps be executed to help the organization 
reach its targets?
A: Choose the most important measures, metrics, KPIs, 
• 
and targets to achieve. Establish the best possible team 
to help execute. Communicate the strategic initiative and 
actionable items effectively with the team. Help ensure 
targets will be met in a controlled manner so as not to 
overwhelm the team. Be sensitive to industry trends, 
competition, the marketplace, and external factors when 
deciding to invest time, money, and resources. Have a 
manageable document tracking or system in place to help 
you evaluate progress and notice patterns.

The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind
113
Q: What should each department or division do to accomplish approved 
targets?
A: In order to move toward a declared target, make sure 
• 
all the assignees, involved parties, and key decision makers 
understand the strategy map, strategic initiatives, action-
able activities, and expectations. Be flexible and ready to 
change, modify, and refine these things if necessary.
Key Takeaway
■
■
  You will never be able to measure every parameter for every area your 
organization is involved in. Instead, focus on key areas and set targets that are appropriate, given the 
internal and external data provided at that given time.
As You Continue On Your Journey
To be a transformational leader, consult this book whenever you approach 
new projects, objectives, and initiatives and activate your leadership on three 
interlocking and dynamically interacting fronts:
understand (consulting the first five chapters on your 
• 
business mind).
do (consulting the final two chapters on transformational 
• 
action informed by knowledge of your business mind).
evolve (by mindful practice). By noticing patterns, and 
• 
recognizing different intelligences, you will start to do so 
subconsciously and you will find them everywhere—in 
your business, customers, partners, and social interactions.
Become…so you can answer the two questions posed at the beginning of this 
book without hesitation:
How confident am I that my business’s performance will 
• 
improve?
Why should I believe the information I have before me is 
• 
accurate?
To become and be, you must execute!

I dedicate this book to you, the reader, on your journey 
forward to success. Success is the ripple effect that 
you cause in society through your actions. The most 
successful actions are rooted in positive intention, 
proactive initiation, inspiring innovation,  
and improvement of self and others.  
Let’s impact the world together!

Foreword
In the world of neuroscience, to which I’ve devoted the last ten years of 
my life, big ideas can change the structure and functioning of your brain in 
extraordinarily positive ways. And when you communicate your big ideas—
and the values they embrace—to other people, you change their brain as well. 
Perhaps most importantly, when you bring your deepest values and new ideas 
into your work and business, you can begin to transform the world. Values like 
love, compassion, integrity, and trust can build stronger relationships among 
lovers, friends, and colleagues.
But you must do so consciously, and you must do so on a daily basis. That 
is why, each year, I ask my Executive MBA students who are enrolled in 
my NeuroLeadership class the following question: “What is your deepest 
innermost value?” My students ask themselves this question every morning 
for ten days. The result: 90% report less stress at work, more productivity, 
and greater joy.
Big ideas can literally add years of happiness to your life, easing anxiety and 
bringing inner peace. Valeh Nazemoff’s The Four Intelligences of the Business 
Mind is a big idea, and a great one. Most businesses aim for success by doing 
better at what they already do. This is an admirable goal, but it’s not a game 
changer. Game-changing ideas come from noticing and meeting the unmet 
needs of your customers, your partners, and your colleagues within your own 
organization. In this book, Ms. Nazemoff shows you the path to finding those 
unmet needs and creating game-changing products and services to solve 
them.
One of the things I love about this book is how the author integrates her 
business expertise with the latest evidence from the world of neuroscience. 
Why? Because we now know enough about the brain to improve the way 
we conduct business in the world. If you ignore the neuroscientific principles 
presented in this book, you limit the success of your work.
One of the most important ideas that Valeh emphasizes is the concept of 
using what she calls your “Business Mind.” You use your Business Mind by 
integrating all of the cognitive skills that are scattered throughout many 
regions of your brain: your logic centers, your data centers, your emotional 
centers, your creative centers, and—most important—your intuitive centers 
located in the newest evolutionary parts of the brain. 

Foreword 
viii
Most people, and thus most organizations, tend to use only one or two of these 
“business brain” skills. They may emphasize facts but lack inspiration, or they 
use their intuition or imagination—it’s often hard to tell which is which—and 
come up with ideas that aren’t practical. As a neuroscience researcher, I know 
that every hypothesis—which often comes from intuition, not logic—needs 
data, and I’m glad Valeh is bringing this idea to the world of business.
The bigger problem, in both science and business, is knowing what problems 
to solve. This is where the Four Intelligences of the Business Mind come 
in. As she helps you understand the concepts of Financial, Customer, Data, 
and Mastermind Intelligence, Valeh leads you through a group of actions that 
you need to take in order to implement them. If you follow her suggestions, 
you will find out what items in your business need to transform, and how to 
transform them. 
If you want to achieve the highest level of transformation, however, you can’t 
just stay inside the bubble of your own business and its customers; you have 
to look at the world at large. Valeh gives you the tools you need to discover 
patterns in the outside world. These patterns will lead you to opportunities 
for your business that you couldn’t find otherwise. You can often fulfill unmet 
needs of customers on a much larger scale when you keep your eye on the 
world at large. 
One of my favorite things about this book is the idea of bringing the philosophy 
behind a mastermind session to your organization on a full-time basis. Two of 
the cornerstones of a mastermind session are brainstorming and acceptance. 
First, you want to come up with as many ideas as possible. As a group, you all 
pledge to listen to all ideas without judgment. If every company were to take 
this creative approach, I suspect many more of the world’s problems could be 
solved.
Finally, Valeh suggests a level of inclusiveness that is rarely practiced in the 
business world. She advises that you include someone from any department 
that is affected by any issue you are looking to solve, even if that issue is only a 
small part of their work. The goal is to filter new plans through as many lenses 
as possible to come up with optimal programs and also to avoid unforeseen 
consequences. 
That sounds like good science to me.
I highly recommend that you look at your organization through the lens of  
The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind. If you do so, your business will 
improve in unexpected ways.

To my early readers, Alan Komet, Chuck Corjay, Shaun Khalfan, James Brady, 
and Joe Distefano—your positive and excited reactions to my early chapters 
meant so much to me.
I have been blessed to have so many inspirational mentors, influencers, 
sponsors, and champions come into my life—George Kafkarkou, Jim Tedesco, 
Bob Otto, Beth Berger, Lorena Costanza, Vaughn Harman, Tracy Balent,  
Larry Walsh, Heather Clancy, Nancy Hammervik, Teresa Varela-Lauper, 
Jennifer Follett, Robert Faletra, Robert DeMarzo, Steve Burke, Herb Siegel, 
Ken Manning, Dave Weetman, Robert Fake, George Janis, Greg Fortunato, 
Mike Namvar, my teachers, and other authors.
Thank you to my students and those that I have mentored and coached 
over the years. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to guide and be of 
service. Thank you also to my friends near and in Bayside, Fenwick Island, 
Delaware, where I spent most of my time writing this book.
The inspiration for The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind would not 
have happened if not for my clients, with whom I travel on this wonderful 
journey.
I am also so grateful to our veterans. Because of you, I have the freedom, as a 
woman, to express, write, and share my thoughts and opinions. Many women 
are not so fortunate in other parts of the world, but I am hopeful one day 
this will change. 
Thanks to my brother, Kaveh Nazemoff, for your creative energy. Thanks to 
my family and friends who graciously and patiently waited as I worked on this 
book, knowing how important it was for me to share this message. Through 
your understanding of my crazy schedule and spotty attendance at events, 
you showed your true love to me. I love you all. 
Special thanks to my grandmother. You are my heart and my soul. Thank you 
for being the female entrepreneur that many aspire to be. You have given 
to so many and changed so many lives. I can only dream to live up to your 
reputation of giving endlessly with no expectation in return. 
Thanks to the angels who helped guide me to creativity and inspiration when 
I had writer’s block—which happened often. 
And thank you, Universe, for bringing it all together in sometimes unexplainable 
ways.
