Typographical Conventions
This guidebook uses the following typographical conventions:
• 
Italics are used for words cited as words rather than used 
functionally (e.g., Over time, the pronunciation of the English 
word knight has undergone numerous changes) and for foreign- 
language words.
• 
Boldface, lowercase type is used for phonetic signs (e.g., Egyptian 
n, Mayan na, Sumerian a).
• 
Boldface, uppercase type is used for logograms (e.g., BAHLAM).
• 
Boldface, italicized type is used for terms that are included in the 
guidebook’s Glossary (e.g., abbreviation).
• 
Brackets are used to represent phones, that is, speech sounds 
capable of being made by humans (e.g., [p], representing a voiceless 
bilabial plosive).
• 
Forward slashes are used to represent phonemes, that is, speech 
sounds that are meaningfully used in any given language (e.g., /p/, 
which can be pronounced either [p] or [ph] in English, depending on 
the context). 
• 
Capital letters are used for Semitic consonantal roots (e.g., Arabic 
KTB, “writing,” Hebrew RB, “master”) and semantic signs (e.g., 
TIME, FEMALE, SWORD).
• 
A colon (:) following a vowel indicates that the vowel is long (in 
the linguistic sense of being pronounced for about twice as long, 
not in the popular sense of “saying its own name”). Some languages 
conventionally double the vowel to signal this (e.g., aa); others add 
a macron over the vowel (e.g., ā). Because this course deals with 

2
Typographical Conventions

dozens of languages, it’s important to remember that [a:], aa, and ā 
are equivalent for our purposes.
• 
Double quotation marks are used for direct quotations, meanings 
of words (e.g., The Maya referred to their writing as k’uhul 
wooj, meaning “holy signs”), translations of sentences, and 
words used in a special sense (e.g., What we might think of as 
the “Chinese language” is, in fact, eight mutually unintelligible  
regional languages).

Writing and Civilization:  
From Ancient Worlds to Modernity
Scope:
F
ew human inventions are as pervasive and central to our modern 
world as writing. Each and every day, most of us read thousands of 
words, whether in traditional formats, such as books, magazines, 
or newspapers, or on the increasingly common computers, smartphones, 
e-book readers, and tablets. But even though writing now seems thoroughly 
modern, it can be traced back more than 5,000 years to ancient Egypt and 
Mesopotamia.
This course will begin with a consideration of what writing is and precisely 
how it differs from other kinds of graphic communication systems. Writing 
always records language, and it does so in surprisingly similar ways in all 
writing systems, ancient and modern. The way the ancients wrote millennia 
ago is not radically different from how we write today. 
We will then turn to an exploration of the origins and development of 
writing, tracing the birth of our own alphabet and its connections to the early 
Germanic runes. We will also explore the independent invention of writing 
in China and its adoption and elaboration in Japan. 
In order to more deeply examine the subject of writing, we will closely 
examine the theory and practice of decipherment. Not all writing systems can 
be deciphered, but what are the limitations, and how can they be overcome? 
We will explore several case studies to put decipherment to the test, including 
ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, Old Persian cuneiform, Mycenaean Linear 
B, Mayan script, and Aztec hieroglyphs. Once we have studied these and 
other ancient writing systems, you will know why Etruscan and Meroïtic 
have proven impossible to decipher; you will understand the urge that 
numerous individuals have had to reform writing or to invent a more perfect 
writing system; and you will be able to assess Darius the Great’s claim that 
he himself invented the Old Persian script.

Scope
4
In comparing the world’s writing systems, we slip the shackles of 
parochialism, recognizing that our alphabet is but one of many similar 
writing systems, all of which capably serve the needs of their users. Writing 
is deeply conservative and resistant to change. It may undergo adaptation 
during borrowing, but a culture will never abandon or radically modify 
its writing system except in the direst instances of cultural transformation 
through conquest or assimilation. We will also come to understand the 
deeply interdependent relationship of writing and civilization, including the 
social, political, and economic forces that led to the adoption of new media 
and technology for writing. These forces not only shaped the form, function, 
and distribution of writing, but through it, they have transformed civilization 
itself. In the concluding lecture, we consider all that we have learned about 
the interplay between writing and civilization and use it to predict one 
possible future of writing. ■

What Is Writing?
Lecture 1
I
t’s almost impossible to imagine a technology more central than writing 
to the way we live and communicate. We use writing every day, and it’s 
all around us all the time. But precisely because of its ubiquity, we take 
writing for granted, as if it has always been here and always will be. We 
should recall, however, that writing was a human invention. At some point 
in the remote past, some inspired individual or small group first hit on the 
idea of writing. In this lecture, we’ll look at ancient ideas about writing as a 
divine gift, and we’ll arrive at a modern definition of writing to enable us to 
embark on our comparative study.
A Gift of the Gods
• 
Some ancient civilizations regarded writing as a divine gift. The 
Egyptians, for example, believed that writing was created by the 
god of wisdom, Thoth. The Egyptians called their god-given 
hieroglyphs mdwt nṭr (“speech of the gods”), a term that Greek 
historians translated as “hieroglyph,” from Greek hieros (“sacred”) 
and glyphē (“carving”). 
• 
In nearby Mesopotamia, the ancient Sumerians believed that 
writing was invented by the head of their pantheon, Énlil. The 
later Assyrians and Babylonians borrowed their writing from the 
Sumerians, but they attributed its invention to their own god Nábû.
• 
In the New World, the Classic Maya of Mexico and Guatemala 
attributed the invention of writing to their sky god, Itzamnaaj. The 
Maya referred to their writing as k’uhul wooj (“holy signs”); thus, 
scholars also refer to them as hieroglyphs.
• 
In the Bible, the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy report that 
the Ten Commandments were written with “the finger of God” 
and were set down in “the first writing.” In the Book of Daniel, 
disembodied fingers wrote a cryptic message of doom on the walls 

6
Lecture 1: What Is Writing?
of Babylon. These are just two of many biblical stories in which 
writing serves as a vehicle of divine inspiration or judgment.
The Stability of Writing
• 
One of the reasons that early writing systems remained stable for 
so long is precisely because they were sacred. To abandon or alter 
them would have been sacrilegious. Thus, Egyptian hieroglyphic 
writing persisted in the same 
complex mixture of word, 
sound, and semantic signs for 
more than 3,000 years. 
• 
Updating a writing system 
may seem like a good idea, 
especially if the language 
has changed and the writing 
system 
doesn’t 
accurately 
reflect it, but there are practical 
reasons for the inertia of  
writing systems. 
○
○
Consider 
the 
English 
word knight, for instance, 
with its silent initial k 
and silent internal gh. 
When this spelling first 
became the standard, the 
word was pronounced 
[knixt]. But over time, 
spoken English lost these 
sounds, and the word knight underwent other changes. It’s  
now pronounced [nait] but still written as if it were  
pronounced [knixt]. 
○
○
Updating such spellings would radically change the appearance 
of written English and limit access to literature written in Early 
Modern English, such as the work of Shakespeare or the King 
James Bible, to all but a few experts.
Later pharaohs attempted to erase 
King Tutankhamun from history, 
but his name and some of his 
accomplishments are known to us 
now from the written records left 
behind in his tomb.

• 
An important feature of writing generally is that it allows our 
names and words to outlive us. Our own tombstones and epitaphs, 
like those of ancient kings, are designed to recall our names, dates, 
and cherished family connections for future generations.
• 
The way we write today is not fundamentally different from the 
way the Mesopotamians and Egyptians wrote more than 5,000 
years ago; this means that we can learn quite a lot about the origins, 
development, and significance of writing by comparing our own 
alphabet with other writing systems, both ancient and modern.
Defining Writing
• 
In defining words, we often look to dictionaries for help, but in the 
case of the word writing, dictionary definitions are a bit misleading. 
They are either too general, describing the appearance of writing 
without concern for its structure, or too specific, focusing on 
alphabets to the exclusion of other types of writing.
○
○
For instance, one common dictionary definition of writing 
is “marks (letters, words, or other symbols) inscribed on a 
surface, often paper, with a suitable implement.” 
○
○
This definition captures the form and medium of some writing 
systems, and it correctly conveys the graphic nature of writing, 
but it’s narrow in its focus on paper, and it’s much too vague 
when it comes to what writing actually is. 
• 
A second common definition of writing is “a system of visible 
marks used to transmit ideas.” This meaning seems overly broad. 
There are many systems of visible marks that can convey ideas 
and information, including maps, musical notation, mathematical 
formulas, pictographic street signs, and so on.
○
○
Some scholars argue in favor of a broad definition of writing 
that includes all forms of graphic communication. But by 
this definition, the comparative field would be vast, including 
everything from cave paintings to pictographic street signs. 
Even art and iconography would become, in this definition, a 
kind of writing.

8
Lecture 1: What Is Writing?
○
○
Such a broad definition seems counterintuitive. Most of us 
recognize that there are similarities between our own alphabet 
and Egyptian hieroglyphic writing that simply aren’t shared 
with cave paintings and street signs. 
○
○
For example, both our alphabet and Egyptian have signs for 
sounds, and those signs convey information only to the extent 
that they match words in the English and Egyptian languages. 
Further, the order of these signs has to match the order of the 
sounds in the language; otherwise, the message is nonsensical. 
Other graphic communication systems, such as cave paintings 
and pictography, don’t have phonetic signs, don’t match the 
order of spoken words, and don’t rely on language at all to 
transmit information. 
• 
In contrast to pictography—a system of nonlinguistic graphic 
communication conveying information through imagery and 
context—writing is a system of graphic marks conveying 
information through language. It does this by using phonetic signs 
to communicate the sounds of a language and by putting those signs 
in an order that reflects the order of elements in the language.
• 
Nonlinguistic graphic communication systems have no unifying 
features or structural principles in common. Cave paintings, 
musical notation, and pictographic street signs just don’t form a 
natural set—not with one another and not with writing.
The Link between Writing and Civilization
• 
The real motivation for linking nonlinguistic graphic communication 
systems with writing seems to stem more from empathy and 
political correctness than from the demands of objective evidence. 
The connection of the two systems can be traced to the late-19th-
century anthropologists Edward Burnett Tylor (1832–1917) and 
Lewis Henry Morgan (1818–1881) and their unilinear view of 
cultural evolution. 
○
○
Tylor and Morgan argued that human societies had progressed 
through several stages of social complexity, which they labeled 

9
bands, tribes, chiefdoms, and states. They listed criteria that 
they saw as characterizing each of these social stages. 
○
○
One of the hallmark traits listed for the state level of 
social organization was writing. In other words, cultures 
with a writing system were civilized; cultures without one  
were uncivilized.
• 
The anthropologist Franz Boas (1858–1942) systematically 
dismantled this simplistic view in the early 20th century, 
pointing out numerous counterexamples to Tylor and Morgan’s 
predictions. He noted that some state-level societies had existed  
without writing, such as the Inka Empire of South America, and 
that some band-and tribal-level societies had writing, such as the  
early-19th-century Cherokee. 
• 
Not everyone recognized Boas’s cautious counterexamples. Even 
later in the 20th century, the founder of the field of grammatology, 
Ignace Gelb (1907–1985), wrote, “Writing exists only in a 
civilization and a civilization cannot exist without writing.” Boas 
had already shown that this claim is untrue, but the idea of a  
one-to-one association between writing and civilization remains 
popular nonetheless.
• 
This popular understanding naturally has an impact on our view of 
such societies as the Inka Empire. 
○
○
Undoubtedly, the Inka Empire was a state-level civilization, 
with elaborate roads and other infrastructure, complex 
administration, and remarkable territorial extent and control 
over subject provinces. 
○
○
The Inka also had a system of intricately knotted and colored 
cords known as khipu that could be used to keep track of 
information about goods and labor. Khipu are fascinating 
objects, but no one has ever been able to demonstrate that they 
record language. 

10
Lecture 1: What Is Writing?
• 
There is certainly a strong connection between writing and 
civilization, but it’s not a simple cause-and-effect relationship. 
Rather, writing is a tool for, and a product of, numerous important 
social structures, such as religion, politics, and economy, and it’s in 
a complex feedback relationship with these same social structures. 
Writing as Visible Speech
• 
To return to the definition of writing, specialists now divide 
nonlinguistic graphic communication systems from writing proper. 
In this course, we will follow a definition of writing first proposed 
by the linguist Archibald Hill (1886–1977) and later refined by 
John DeFrancis (1911–2009), a scholar of Chinese writing.
• 
As Hill noted in 1967, “all writing represents speech.” Much more 
recently, DeFrancis put it similarly: “writing is visible speech.” 
Both scholars would agree that writing is a system of graphic marks 
representing the sounds and words of spoken language. As we’ve 
seen, this definition is also intuitively satisfying in that it recognizes 
the fact that different kinds of writing are similar to one another in 
this way.
• 
DeFrancis also said that there is a “diverse oneness of writing.” 
The use of phonetic signs to record spoken language is a hallmark 
of writing systems. A pattern of striking simplicity underlies the 
superficial differences of all writing systems, past and present, 
knitting them together into a coherent whole. All writing systems 
have phonetic signs, and all writing systems link symbols together 
in an order dictated by the language being represented.
• 
When we compare writing systems using the definition of writing 
as “visible speech,” we open up a fascinating world of discovery. 
○
○
Writing systems are intrinsically interesting as beautiful and 
mysterious inventions stretching back beyond the beginnings 
of recorded history. 
○
○
A comparative study of writing also teaches us things about 
past cultures and languages that we can’t learn any other way. 

11
○
○
Further, the study of superficially different but structurally 
similar scripts is a cure for our own parochialism, opening our 
eyes to other possibilities and shedding light on the tensions 
between innovative and conservative forces in our own culture, 
language, and writing system. Through these lectures, we’ll not 
only learn about ancient writing systems and civilizations but 
also about ourselves.
alphabet: A writing system composed of a mixture of consonantal and 
vocalic signs.
grammatology: The comparative study of writing systems. The term 
was coined by Ignace Gelb (1952). A student of comparative writing is  
a grammatologist.
hieroglyph: Literally “sacred carving” (from Greek); now refers to single 
signs in a hieroglyphic script. Initially applied only to Egyptian but now 
freely used to describe many pictorial logophonetic scripts, such as Hittite 
(Luwian), Mayan, and Aztec.
Mesopotamia: The land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present-
day Iraq; a rich alluvial plain sometimes called the “fertile crescent.” 
Mesopotamia was the site of the ancient civilizations of Akkad, Assyria, 
Babylonia, Elam, and Sumer.
pictography (also picture writing): A system of nonlinguistic graphic 
communication conveying information through imagery and context. Most 
writing systems have signs that originated pictographically, but this says 
nothing about the function of those signs in a writing system, which will 
always be phonetic, logographic, or semantic. Grammatologists have retired 
the term pictogram (or pictograph) as a sign type.
sign (or grapheme): An irreducible graphic unit of a script possessing its 
own reading value. The major sign types are logograms, phonetic signs, 
semantic signs, diacritics, and numerals.

2.	 Why is it important that we define writing as “visible speech”? How is 
writing different from the symbols on restroom doors?
3.	 Why do you suppose writing was so often regarded as a gift of the gods?
4.	 What is meant by the term hieroglyph (or hieroglyphic)? Do you find 
it confusing that the same term is used for scripts as different from one

    Questions to Consider

13
The Origins and Development of Writing
Lecture 2
I
n this lecture, we explore three myths about where writing comes from 
and how it developed. The first of these is that writing was invented 
only once, after which it was borrowed by later groups. The second 
myth is that writing began with clay tokens, considered the forerunners of 
pictorial signs for sheep, grain, oil, and so on. The idea here is that once 
the idea of impressing shapes into clay caught hold, the tokens themselves 
were abandoned, and writing emerged. The third myth is that writing was 
developed to serve the administrative needs of early cities; in other words, 
writing was invented by history’s first accountants. As we’ll see in this 
lecture, none of these beliefs is true.
Monogenesis: The Theory of “Single Origin”
• 
The theory that writing was invented only once and then borrowed 
by later groups is called monogenesis. Although this idea remains 
popular, scientific comparison clearly shows that it can’t be true. 
For example, there is now no doubt that Mayan hieroglyphic 
writing and other ancient writing systems of Mexico developed 
independently of those in the Old World. 
• 
What about Old World writing systems? Could they have descended 
from one original script? Some scholars would place this origin in 
Mesopotamia; others, in Egypt. In both of these regions, evidence 
of writing is found by at least 3100 B.C.
• 
The Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations are remarkably close 
neighbors, which is the main reason that their writing systems are 
often thought to be related. In the 19th century, the idea that something 
as complex and ingenious as writing could have been independently 
invented in multiple places seemed absurd. Outright borrowing, or at 
least borrowing of the idea of writing, seemed more likely. 

14
Lecture 2: The Origins and Development of Writing
• 
To test this theory, we can look to later writing systems that we 
know were borrowed to discover certain structural hallmarks  
of borrowing. 
○
○
The most famous example of a borrowed writing system is 
Japanese writing, which was adapted from Chinese writing in 
the 5th century A.D. Japanese signs contain clear indications 
of having been borrowed from China, including shared sign 
shapes, reading values, and spelling rules.
○
○
The cuneiform scripts also represent more than a dozen cases 
of borrowing. As with Chinese signs in Japanese writing, the 
borrowed scripts provide internal evidence for their origins, 
including shared sign shapes, reading values, and spelling 
rules. Scholars can use these features to trace a borrowed script, 
such as Hittite cuneiform, back to its source, in this instance, 
Akkadian cuneiform. 
Even in cases where certain cuneiform scripts were not borrowed directly from 
precursor scripts but were merely inspired by them, the form and arrangement 
of these scripts still indicate their derivative nature.

○
○
As a final example, consider the origins of our own alphabet. 
Most people know that we can trace it back to the Romans. 
But the Romans borrowed their alphabet from the Etruscans, 
who had borrowed it from the Greeks in the 8th century B.C. 
The Greeks, in turn, had borrowed their alphabet from the 
Phoenicians, who had borrowed their script from Proto-
Sinaitic, which dates back to almost 2000 B.C. 
○
○
We can follow the development of the alphabet in the case of 
our own letter A. The arbitrary shape of the letter A goes all 
the way back to Greece, where alpha was the name of the first 
letter of the alphabet. Why this name, and why the shape of  
the letter? 
○
○
The Greek letter alpha was rotated 90 degrees from its original 
orientation in Phoenician script, where it was used for a glottal 
stop consonant.
○
○
The letter A actually began as a picture of an ox’s head (Hebrew 
‘aleph), and it was clearly intended to conjure up the first 
sound in the Semitic word ‘aleph (“ox”), namely, a glottal stop. 
○
○
When Greek speakers borrowed the Phoenician alphabet, they 
didn’t need the glottal stop sound; thus, they ignored the initial 
glottal stop of the word ‘aleph and called the sign alpha, using 
it for the sound [a], which was basically the first sound they 
heard in the Semitic word. 
• 
Are there any shared structural features between Egyptian or 
Sumerian that would suggest borrowing? The answer is no. 
Egyptian and Sumerian resemble each other only insofar as their 
signs have pictorial origins. There are no shared sign forms, sound 
values, or spelling rules. 
• 
There is also no linking narrative between these systems, such as 
the story we can tell about the letter A. Similarly, when we compare 
the early writing systems of Minoan Crete, China, and Mexico 

16
Lecture 2: The Origins and Development of Writing
to those of Egypt and Mesopotamia, we find that none of these 
writing systems has the kinds of similarities we see between truly  
related scripts.
• 
It’s still too early to rule out all contacts between these writing 
systems, but the available evidence now suggests that writing 
was invented independently around the world on at least five  
different occasions. 
○
○
Apart from at least five independent inventions of writing, 
nearly all other writing systems appear to have been borrowed. 
This includes all of the world’s alphabets (ancient and modern) 
and most of the cuneiform scripts.
○
○
It’s important to note that an important feature of borrowing is 
innovation. Writing is never borrowed without some invention, 
elaboration, or alteration. Scholars call this process “borrowing 
with adaptation.”
Writing Inspired by Clay Tokens
• 
The theory that writing was inspired by clay tokens used in 
accounting was proposed by the archaeologist Denise Schmandt-
Besserat. Although this theory remains popular, it’s not widely 
accepted by specialists of comparative writing.
• 
The chronological correlation of clay tokens with the first writing 
is difficult to explain if tokens truly gave rise to writing. Tokens 
preceded writing in Mesopotamia by almost 5,000 years, and they 
continued to exist alongside writing for more than 1,500 years. 
The pattern suggests two independent systems perhaps serving  
different functions. 
• 
Further, if different shapes of tokens were actually the forerunners 
of pictorial signs, we might expect some formal correlation 
between tokens and the earliest signs. But apart from a few possibly 
coincidental resemblances, there is no strong correlation. 

17
• 
Comparative evidence also compels us to ask why tokens are 
limited to early Mesopotamia if writing developed independently 
several times in different parts of the world. 
○
○
When scholars still supported script monogenesis, it was fine to 
point to tokens in Mesopotamia as the origin for all writing, but 
now, the use of tokens seems like a purely local phenomenon. 
○
○
What we need to explain is why at least five different ancient 
civilizations independently hit on phonetic signs as the core of 
their inventions of writing. Seen in this light, the long focus 
on clay tokens in discussions of the invention of writing is a 
category error. 
Writing for Administrative Requirements
• 
It’s true that some of the earliest clay tablets from Mesopotamia, 
dating from the late 4th millennium B.C., record transactions 
involving barley. It’s also true that bureaucratic palace records 
were the entire output of Mycenaean Linear B (the ancient writing 
system of Crete), and the same thing seems to be true of the older, 
undeciphered Linear A inscriptions. But when we move away 
from the Mesopotamian and Cretan examples, we find numerous 
counterexamples to the claim that writing was developed for purely 
administrative purposes. 
• 
For example, the first writing in China, represented by the Shang 
oracle bones of 1200 B.C., has much to say about divination 
and religious ritual but almost nothing about ancient economy. 
Similarly, the earliest writing systems in Mesoamerica and Egypt 
were used for political functions: to record the names and titles 
of royalty in captions associated with figural art. Writing also 
appeared in “nametags”—labels recording the private ownership of 
treasured objects. Thus, early writing appears to have been used for 
a fairly heterogeneous set of purposes. 
• 
Again, we have to ask why the administrative use of early writing 
appears limited to Mesopotamia and Crete. Given that writing 
apparently developed independently several times in different parts 

18
Lecture 2: The Origins and Development of Writing
of the world and was used for multiple purposes, we are better 
off discarding administration as a prime mover. When scholars 
still supported the idea of script monogenesis, Mesopotamian 
administration seemed to be a reasonable model, but once again, we 
now have to consider the origins of writing more broadly.
Recording Proper Nouns
• 
Writing is an eminently adaptable technology. For this reason, 
our best hope for uncovering its origins is to study its structural 
characteristics. As we noted in the last lecture, writing is visible 
speech, making use of phonetic signs to record language. 
Phoneticism is also the structural hallmark of at least five 
independent inventions of writing and characterizes all later 
borrowings and adaptations of writing. Why should this be so?
• 
Quite unlike the numerals, icons, heraldic emblems, and magical 
sigils that would have been sufficient for the purposes often 
imagined as having given rise to writing, there is one category of 
spoken language not so amendable to symbolic representation. That 
category is the proper noun.
○
○
From a comparative perspective, proper nouns are highly 
language specific and resist translation. There are some proper 
nouns that still bear meaning, but they are in fairly short supply. 
○
○
Where obvious meanings have been lost, the only way to 
record such names is with phonetic signs, just as we do in our 
alphabet and as the Egyptians and Aztecs did with the names of 
foreign conquerors from Greece and Spain, respectively. This 
is why phonetic signs are already present in the earliest known  
writing systems. 
○
○
In the first writing from Egypt and Mesopotamia, we already 
find personal names and titles. Both of these scripts routinely 
caption images with names, as do the New World scripts. And 
all writing systems label important objects with the names of 
their owners.

19
• 
The specific use of writing to label ownership of objects might 
be secondary to the original use of writing, but the larger point is 
inescapable: Phonetic signs are the hallmark of writing, and it’s their 
presence we have to explain if we want to understand the invention 
of writing. The most reasonable explanation of the development of 
phonetic signs is that they were needed to write categories of words 
that could not easily be written in any other way. Proper names, in 
whatever environment, are the prime candidates.
• 
Writing was independently invented several times in human 
history. It’s not related to clay tokens, and although it’s useful for 
accounting, it’s equally useful for pretty much everything else! 
Writing seems to have grown out of a need to record proper nouns, 
but once it was invented, it proved itself the most adaptable of tools, 
eminently suited to all kinds of purposes, and an irresistible lure to 
all who came into contact with it, borrowing and adapting it to their 
own languages and purposes.
‘aleph: The first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, representing a glottal plosive 
consonant ([ʔ]). The Hebrew sign derives from Proto-Sinaitic, where it 
depicts an ox (Semitic: *’ālp).
caption: A short text adjacent to an illustrated figure or object, which it 
names or describes.
consonant: A speech sound in which the breath is at least partly obstructed 
and which cannot form the nucleus of a syllable on its own (e.g., p).
cuneiform: Any of a large group of Near Eastern writing systems having 
wedge-shaped characters. Some of these scripts are historically related (e.g., 
Sumerian, Babylonian, and Hittite); others are merely visually influenced by 
them (e.g., Ugaritic, Old Persian).
    Important Terms

20
Lecture 2: The Origins and Development of Writing
glottal: Refers to a sound made with the glottis (the part of the larynx 
consisting of the vocal cords and the slitlike opening between them), such as 
fricative [h] and plosive [ʔ] (Hebrew ‘aleph).
Linear A: An undeciphered logosyllabic script found mostly on Crete, 
Thera, and other Cycladic islands, dating to c. 1800–1450 B.C.
Linear B (also Mycenaean script): Logosyllabic script recording the 
Mycenaean Greek language, mostly known from Crete and mainland Greece 
and dating to c. 1450–1200 B.C. Deciphered by Michael Ventris in 1952.
Mayan: Refers to a large group of related languages and their speakers in 
Mexico and Central America. By convention, Maya refers to the people and 
their culture, whereas Mayan specifically refers to language.
monogenesis: The theory that writing was invented only once (usually in 
Mesopotamia), after which it diffused to all later groups.
numeral (or numeric sign): A sign for a number, such as the Arabic 
numerals 1, 2, and 3.
proper name (also proper noun or rigid designator): A name used for a 
specific person, place, or thing. In English, proper names always receive 
initial capital letters.
Proto-Sinaitic: The oldest known ancestor of the alphabet, a pictorial abjad 
(writing system that comprises consonantal signs only) dating to the mid-
19th century B.C. and currently attested in the southwest Sinai Peninsula and 
Middle Egypt.
Semitic: A large family of languages spoken in the Middle East and Ethiopia, 
including Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, and the now-extinct Babylonian. Best 
known for its three-consonant word roots, e.g., Arabic KTB (“write”), giving 
kataba (“he wrote”), maktab (“office”), and so on. The common ancestor of 
these languages is known as Proto-Semitic.

Where Did Our Alphabet Come From?
Lecture 3
M
ost people know that our alphabet is technically referred to as the 
Roman (or Latin) alphabet. It initially spread during the days of the 
Roman Republic and continued during the Roman imperial period 
and the medieval Holy Roman Empire. As a result of the vast military power, 
socioeconomic influence, and religious authority of Rome, derivatives of the 
Roman alphabet are now used to write hundreds of modern languages. Not 
coincidentally, these languages include those of the great colonial powers of 
the last half millennium: English, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, and French. 
In this lecture, we’ll investigate the development of the alphabet and explore 
some fascinating recent discoveries about its origins.
Connected Alphabets
• 
Dozens of alphabets are in daily use around the world today, and all 
but a handful are connected by borrowing from a single invention 
almost 4,000 years ago. 
○
○
The early Germanic peoples adapted the early Roman alphabet 
into the runic alphabet in the 2nd century A.D., and English 
itself was first written in runes. Centuries later, English 
speakers again borrowed the Roman alphabet, replacing their 
runic script with it.
○
○
Another connected script is the Greek alphabet, which was 
passed to the Etruscans, who in turn passed it to the Romans. 
○
○
The Greek alphabet was also developed into the Cyrillic 
alphabet. Cyrillic is now used to write Russian, Bulgarian, 
Serbian, and Ukrainian, as well as other Slavic languages. 
○
○
The modern Arabic and Hebrew scripts are also connected to 
our alphabet, though the Phoenician script that gave rise to 
them hasn’t survived. 

23
○
○
Even Braille, Morse code, and American Sign Language trace 
their origins to the alphabet. They may not use linear signs, but 
their order and arrangement are copied from the alphabet. 
• 
The connections between the widely shared alphabets include not 
only the shapes of signs and their phonetic values but also their 
organization. 
○
○
Thus, the order of letters in our alphabet (a, b, c, …) is not 
appreciably different from the order of letters used by the 
Romans, Greeks, and Phoenicians.
○
○
A vestige of this shared order even survives in the word 
alphabet, which comes from Late Latin alphabetum. This 
word, in turn, comes from Greek alphabetos, in reference to 
the first two letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha and beta. 
The Phoenician Alphabet
• 
Similarities in the shapes, sounds, and organization of the alphabet 
have been recognized for centuries. Writing in the 5th century B.C., 
the historian Herodotus correctly traced the origins of Greek letters 
to the Phoenicians. 
• 
The link to the Phoenicians is both logical and likely. Phoenicia was 
a major trading power in the Mediterranean during the early part of 
the 1st millennium B.C. 
○
○
The Phoenician homeland (or ancient Canaan) was located 
on the shores of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, roughly 
corresponding to modern Lebanon, the coastal plains of Syria, 
and Palestine. 
○
○
At the height of their influence, Phoenician traders reached 
all the shores of the Mediterranean, and Phoenician colonists 
settled much of the southwestern Mediterranean, including 
Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria, as well as Malta, Sicily, and 
even Spain. 

24
Lecture 3: Where Did Our Alphabet Come From?
○
○
Perhaps the most valuable commodity the Phoenicians brought 
into the Mediterranean was their writing system.
• 
The Phoenician script of 22 letters was technically an abjad, which 
means that it recorded consonants only, not vowels. Such a system 
seems a bit odd to us, but Semitic languages are structured in such a 
way that consonants are much more important than vowels. 
○
○
The Arabic root KTB, meaning “write,” is a favorite example. 
Such roots must be fleshed out with vowels to form words. 
Thus, the basic meaning of “write”  is derived by certain 
patterns of vowels to produce various verbs and nouns 
related to writing: katab, “to write”; kitaab, “book”; and 
maktaba, “library.” 
○
○
Common to all of these words is the consonantal root KTB, 
whereas English requires different root words, such as write, 
book, and library, to translate the Arabic forms.
• 
In a language in which consonants convey meaning and vowels 
are often predictable from context, it naturally makes sense for 
the writing system to highlight consonants at the expense of 
vowels. This explains why this feature of the Phoenician script has 
been retained by descendant scripts used to write other Semitic 
languages, such as Aramaic, Hebrew, and Arabic, all of which use 
the same consonantal root system.
Greek Adaptations
• 
The Greeks who adopted the Phoenician script in about 900 B.C. 
did not speak a Semitic language but an Indo-European one. Like 
other Indo-European languages, Greek required vowels to signal 
the grammatical endings of its rich inflectional system. 
• 
Rather than inventing new signs for vowels, the Greeks followed 
the common practice of adapting existing signs to their needs. 
Given the profound differences between Semitic and Indo-
European languages, there were actually a fair number of sounds 

25
in Phoenician that the Greek didn’t have, and the signs for these 
sounds could be altered to serve the needs of written Greek. 
○
○
Most notably, this adaptation included the first letter of the 
Phoenician abjad, the ‘aleph sign, which signaled a glottal  
stop consonant. 
○
○
The Greeks didn’t even hear this sound and simply adapted the 
letter ‘aleph (which they came to call alpha) to write the vowel 
sound [a:]. They made similar adaptations throughout the 
system, thereby converting the Semitic abjad into an alphabet.
• 
Apart from the phonetic substitutions, there is another striking 
feature we notice only when we compare the Greek and Phoenician 
sign forms: The Greek forms are all rotated by varying degrees. 
Scholars still aren’t entirely sure why some signs were rotated and 
others were not. 
Discoveries at Serabit
• 
Scholars of the late 19th century had already identified most of these 
connections between Greek and Phoenician, and it was generally 
assumed that the Phoenicians had, in fact, invented the alphabet 
they ended up broadcasting across the Mediterranean. That changed 
in 1905 with a series of discoveries made by Hilda Petrie (1871–
1956), wife of the Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie (1853–1942).
• 
The Petries were excavating at Serabit el-Khadim, a mountain in 
the southwest Sinai Peninsula. There, Hilda Petrie noticed graffiti 
in a temple to the Egyptian goddess Hathor (dating to the beginning 
of the 2nd millennium B.C.) and in nearby turquoise mines. The 
graffiti was written using 22 pictorial signs. Given the small number 
of signs and their frequent repetition, this script was obviously an 
alphabet or abjad, but interpretation of it proved difficult.
• 
In 1916, the Egyptologist Sir Alan Gardiner noted a frequently 
repeated set of four signs, which he interpreted as the letters b-‘-l-t, 
recording the Canaanite appellative Ba‘alat, “Lady.” The key to his 
interpretation was a bilingual inscription on a small stone sphinx 

26
Lecture 3: Where Did Our Alphabet Come From?
from the temple to Hathor. The Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription 
on the sphinx could be read as “Beloved of Hathor, Lady of 
Turquoise.” This phrase was associated with a text of seven signs in 
the pictorial alphabet. 
○
○
Gardiner speculated that the presence of Canaanites at Serabit 
might explain these seven signs and that they perhaps recorded 
a Semitic language in an early abjad.
○
○
He compared some of the signs to likely candidates in Semitic 
vocabulary and sign shapes in the Phoenician, Aramaic, 
Arabic, and Hebrew scripts. He eventually proposed that the 
signs be transcribed as m-’-h-(b) b-‘-l-t and read as “Beloved 
of the Lady,” a reasonable translation of Egyptian “Beloved of 
Hathor, Lady of Turquoise.” 
• 
Gardiner’s decipherment has been well received, though other 
inscriptions at Serabit have proven more difficult to translate, and 
Turquoise mines at Serabit el-Khadim had been worked by Egyptian  
expeditions for hundreds of years and yielded interesting incised graffiti in the 
early 20th century.

27
not all scholars agree on the precise reading of all the signs or the 
mechanisms by which this pictorial script originated. 
Recent Discoveries
• 
About 10 years ago, a dramatic find in Middle Egypt threw the Sinai 
origin of this script into question. In the summer of 1993–1994, the 
Egyptologists John and Deborah Darnell were surveying the desert 
roads that once linked the ancient cities of Thebes and Abydos to 
important settlements. In a derelict ravine known as Wadi el-Ḥôl 
(“Ravine of Terror”), the Darnells discovered two graffiti that 
were strikingly similar to those discovered by the Petries at Serabit  
el-Khadim.
• 
The Wadi el-Ḥôl inscriptions have been recorded and studied by 
Bruce Zuckerman, a scholar of West Semitic inscriptions. Like the 
Serabit inscriptions, frustratingly little can be made out for certain, 
but both the “ox” (‘aleph) and “house” (beth) signs can be seen. 
• 
The association with Egyptian texts at the same site suggests a date 
somewhere around 1900 B.C. The probable Semitic vocabulary, 
coupled with the connection to the earlier Serabit el-Khadim finds, 
suggests that these inscriptions were made by Semitic speakers 
traveling through the region with Egyptians, perhaps as mercenaries 
in Egyptian armies or as merchants.
• 
At the end of the day, we know much less than we’d like to about 
this early abjad, the origin of our own alphabet. Scholars still hope 
for more texts, preferably bilingual inscriptions, to increase our 
certainty about the values of these early signs and to test Gardiner’s 
“alphabet hypothesis.” 
Development by the Canaanites
• 
By the early 18th century B.C., Canaanite immigrants had founded 
the large city of Avaris (Tell el-Dab’a) in the eastern Nile delta. In 
less than 200 years, they would conquer and rule Egypt for a time 
as the Hyksos. Sometime in the period between their arrival and 
conquest, during their first acculturation to Egyptian civilization, 

28
Lecture 3: Where Did Our Alphabet Come From?
some of the Canaanites may have invented what would become  
the alphabet. 
• 
Surrounded by several Egyptian scripts, it’s little wonder that they 
recognized the utility of writing or that they chose a pictorial script 
as the proper vehicle of language. Seen in this light, choosing 
the head of an ox to represent the first sound in the word ‘aleph 
seems a natural solution. This process is called acrophony, and as 
we will see throughout these lectures, it is common in the world’s  
writing systems.
• 
Still debated, however, is the extent to which Egyptian hieroglyphs 
formed a model for the new script. Apart from the proximity of 
the two scripts and their shared pictorial nature, none of the early 
alphabetic signs looks much like contemporary Egyptian ones, nor 
do they share any sound values. It’s perhaps safest to regard the 
early Canaanite abjad as having been inspired by Egyptian literacy 
but not directly derived from it.
• 
Over time, as the Canaanite script was adopted and adapted 
by speakers of other Semitic languages, it became stylized 
and simplified, losing its pictorial character in favor of more  
linear forms. 
• 
The simplicity of the alphabet, allowing it to be easily transmitted 
in even a short period of time, is undoubtedly a factor in its 
popularity. With the addition of vowels (courtesy of its adaptation 
by the Greeks), the alphabet is also capable of reasonably recording 
practically any language. 
abjad (or consonantary): A writing system composed of consonantal signs 
only, such as Proto-Sinaitic and Phoenician. The term was coined by Peter 
Daniels (1990).
    Important Terms

29
acrophony: Process whereby a phonetic sign originates from the initial 
sounds of a logogram.
Cyrillic: A Greek-derived alphabet named after the late-9th-century Greek 
missionary Saint Cyril and now used to write Russian, Ukrainian, and other 
Slavic languages.
Indo-European: The large language family now occupying most of Europe, 
Iran, and India and including English, Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. The 
common ancestor of these languages probably originated on the northern 
steppes of the Black Sea and is known as Proto-Indo-European.
vowel: A speech sound produced by a relatively open vocal tract, with 
vibration of the vocal cords but without audible friction. Usually forms 
the nucleus of a syllable. Depending on where they are made in the mouth, 
vowels can be classified as high (i, u), mid (e, o), low (a), front (e, i), and 
back (o, u). Thus, i is high front vowel; o a mid back one.

The Fuþark—A Germanic Alphabet
Lecture 4
I
t’s often thought that the German barbarians of northern Europe were 
first taught to read and write by 7th-century Christian missionaries, but in 
fact, the Germanic tribes had learned to write at least 500 years earlier. 
They had an alphabet called runic, derived from the Roman alphabet. The 
peoples of Britain, Scandinavia, and northwestern Europe all wrote in runes 
until this system was replaced by still another Roman-derived alphabet, the 
script English speakers still use today. Unlike many other writing systems, 
runes never needed to be deciphered and could easily have remained with us. 
In this lecture, we’ll look at the real history of this alphabet as a case study in 
why writing systems rise and fall.
Derivation from the Roman Alphabet
• 
The earliest runes found date to the mid-2nd century A.D.; thus, 
they developed during a time when the cultural influence of Rome 
was at its height. One scholar in particular, Henrik Williams, has 
done a remarkable job of highlighting just how strong the evidence 
is for the derivation of runes from the Roman alphabet. The time 
and region of the earliest runes, as well as their shapes and sound 
values, all point inexorably to the Roman alphabet as their source.
○
○
Several runes look almost exactly like letters of the Roman 
alphabet. For example, the first letter of the runic alphabet is a 
sign that not only looks like but also represents the same sound 
as the Roman letter F. 
○
○
Still other runes seem mysterious. For instance, the rune 
shaped most like a Roman P represents the sound /w/, whereas 
the actual rune for the sound /p/ looks nothing like the Roman 
P or, for that matter, any Roman letter. 
○
○
Despite such mysteries and uncertainties, the basic derivation 
of runes from the Roman alphabet can’t be doubted.

32
Lecture 4: The Fuþark—A Germanic Alphabet
• 
The barbarian tribes who lived at the northern fringes of the Roman 
Empire spoke a language that scholars now call Germanic. This 
label is used to identify a large group of closely related languages 
spoken in northwestern Europe by the ancestors of such groups as 
the Goths, Vandals, Lombards, Franks, and so on.
• 
Like most tribal peoples in contact with a complex urban civilization 
(and its military), the Germanic peoples were overwhelmed by the 
Roman Empire. 
○
○
Conquered Germanic leaders had to give up their sons to the 
Romans, who were then held captive in Rome or at various 
frontier garrisons. Of course, while they were captive, they 
learned something of the ways of their captors.
○
○
Young Germanic men also served in Roman armies, and we 
know that Roman legionaries were taught the rudiments of the 
Roman alphabet, including how to sign their names. This would 
have provided another mechanism for Germanic speakers to be 
introduced to the early Roman alphabet. 
○
○
Letters sent to the Roman frontier in northern England during 
the 1st and 2nd centuries A.D. may also have served as the 
source and inspiration for runes.
• 
Whether it was a Germanic-speaking legionary returning home 
after his time in the army or a Romanized Germanic prince 
returning from captivity to succeed his father, it seems clear that at 
least some familiarity with Roman letters preceded the invention of 
runes. Most importantly, of the 24 runes used in the earliest runic 
script, more than half of them can now be shown to derive directly 
from the Roman alphabet in terms of shape and sound value.
Rune Sticks
• 
The earliest runic alphabet is known as the fuþark, after the sound 
values of the first six runes. Most of the signs have one or more full-
length vertical lines, called staves, that sprout diagonal branches. 
Note that runes do not have horizontal lines. 

33
○
○
The long staves of runes were designed to be cut 
perpendicularly across wood grain. Any horizontal lines, which 
would have to run parallel with the grain, would lack contrast 
or even be indistinguishable. 
○
○
The early focus on cutting signs into wood is probably reflected 
in our word writing, which comes from Old English writan, 
properly meaning “to inscribe” and “to engrave.” In copying 
Roman alphabetic letters (mostly painted or inked on vellum), 
the early Germanic rune carvers had to make several formal 
concessions to the medium of carving on wood. This served to 
hide the derivation of runes from Roman letters for a long time.
• 
The archaeological record backs up this formal analysis. Rune-
inscribed sticks are well described in Viking sagas and early 
historical sources. But some scholars wondered how accurate these 
descriptions were, believing that runes might not have been quite so 
versatile at communicating language as the sources described.
• 
Those beliefs changed in 1955, when a great fire ravaged the historic 
district of Bergen, Norway. Archaeologists seized the opportunity 
to dig below the foundations of the modern city to the medieval 
seaport below. There, in layers dating back to the 12th century A.D., 
more than 500 rune-inscribed wooden objects were found. 
○
○
Many of these objects are rune sticks that could be attached to 
belongings or stuck into bales of goods to identify their owners. 
○
○
Slightly longer messages are more charming for what they 
reveal about the social dimensions of writing in 12th-century 
Scandinavia. “Ingebjorg loved me when I was in Stavanger,” 
boasts one. Another reads, “I’d like to get to the pub  
more often.” 
• 
Since these early finds at Bergen, archaeologists have made similar 
discoveries in the medieval foundations of towns elsewhere in 
Norway, Sweden, and Denmark and in Viking Age settlements 
in northern Russia, south Jutland, and even Dublin, Ireland. Still 

34
Lecture 4: The Fuþark—A Germanic Alphabet
earlier Dark Age settlements in the coastal Netherlands also yield 
wooden rune sticks. 
○
○
The medium of wood was ideal for short messages and the 
simple identification of goods. Carving in wood was simple, 
cheap, and convenient, and once the message was no longer 
needed, the stick could be shaved again for a reply or simply 
thrown into the fire as kindling.
○
○
In contrast, contemporary Romans got their medium for 
writing by flaying a sheep or cow for its skin, then preparing, 
stretching, and cutting the skin before sewing the pieces into a 
scroll or a book. 
○
○
The limitations of runes cut in wood, of course, were message 
length and storage. This may be the reason that the Roman 
alphabet and its attendant technologies eventually beat out 
runes in 7th-century Germany, 11th-century England, and Early 
Modern Scandinavia.
Properties of Early Runes
• 
At least half of the early fuþark runes can be seen to come from 
Roman letters; F, A, R, C, H, N, I, S, T, B, M, and O are all fairly 
straightforward derivations. Allowing for varying degrees of 
rotation, the characters for U, E, and L might also be added. At 
least five other runes seem to involve the invention of new signs for 
sounds that didn’t exist in Latin (or the Roman alphabet): [Ɵ], [g], 
[w], [ŋ], and [z/r]. This really leaves only the origins of four signs 
unaccounted for: J, Ï, P, and D.
• 
Although the shape and value of the runes seem to reasonably 
derive from the Roman alphabet, rune names and order clearly 
deviate from Roman practice. This is somewhat surprising given 
the stability of the names of the alphabet letters from Phoenician 
through to the early Roman alphabet and given that the order of 
the letters has also been maintained through numerous borrowings. 
It seems that runes were given Germanic names that, wherever 
possible, begin with the sound whose value they carried. 

35
• 
The rune names were clearly important to the idea of the runic 
alphabet. We know this because even though the runes signal 
consonants and vowels used to spell words, they can also be used as 
logograms (“word signs”), conveying their rune names as words in 
themselves. Examples of this use can be found in inscribed jewelry, 
the Beowulf manuscript, and the Lindisfarne Gospels.
• 
So close was the association between rune name and rune that 
sound changes in the Germanic languages affected the rune value 
through the rune name. Thus, when Anglo-Frisian, an early ancestor 
of English, underwent sound changes that changed the word ansuz 
(“god”) to aas and then os, the fourth rune, ansuz, itself became os, 
and the rune began to represent the letter O! 
Uses of Runes
• 
Our earliest attested use of runes is to write personal names. As 
mentioned in Lecture 2, this is a common pattern, and proper names 
may have provided the motivation for phonetic writing in the first 
place. Apart from the utility of being able to write one’s name, the 
Roman-derived script was also prestigious, perhaps providing an 
additional motivation for borrowing. 
• 
Despite the practical motivations for borrowing and the mundane 
personal objects with owners’ names that dominate the first few 
hundred years of runic writing, the eventual outcome was inspiring: 
1,500 years of writing and the earliest written records of the 
Germanic languages. 
• 
Runes were used for many centuries by different peoples to 
represent different languages; as a result, they changed significantly 
over time. Variations across different times and regions allow runic 
specialists to identify fakes easily.
• 
The fact that so many objects record the names of their makers 
in runes suggests that literacy may have been limited to a small 
group of rune masters. This fits with what little we know of 
early Germanic cultures from Roman historical sources, which 

36

depict them as largely oral. 
Whatever specific purposes 
writing 
served, 
they  
seem 
to 
have 
been  
different from contemporary 
Latin purposes.
• 
There is a popular notion that 
early Germanic runes were 
adopted as magical devices, 
but this idea is not supported 
by the evidence. It’s true that 
some inscriptions seem to 
record magical spells, but 
this is true of most scripts, 
including our own. 
• 
It’s often argued that the 
demise of the runes was 
inevitable with the Roman 
Catholic Church stamping 
out 
pagan 
customs, 
but 
church officials did not go 
out of their way to restrict the use of runes. 
○
○
Rather, it seems that runes entered into competition with and 
were defeated by their own source script: the Roman alphabet. 
Given the prestige lent to it by the church, the Roman alphabet 
began to be adopted for the everyday purposes that runes had 
once served, and the new alphabet proved equally practical 
and adaptable. 
○
○
Nonetheless, runes continued to survive in England and 
Scandinavia alongside Christianity and the Roman alphabet. 
In England, it wasn’t until the Norman Conquest of A.D. 1066 
that runes succumbed to the Roman alphabet. In Scandinavian 
countries, the runes persisted through the High Middle Ages 
Eventually, runes would 
decorate Viking Age runestones, 
monuments raised in memory of the 
deceased or erected by  
the living to commemorate 
successful conquests.

Chinese—A Logosyllabic Script
Lecture 5
I
n the last couple of lectures, we’ve looked at numerous alphabets, 
all of which are phonetic writing systems. Chinese, in contrast, is 
a logosyllabic writing system. It’s an entirely different and much 
more complex way of representing language, and it seems strange and 
challenging to those of us who are accustomed to alphabets. Chinese 
writing is the oldest script in continuous use and one of the most complex 
writing systems ever devised, with thousands of signs. A study of this rich 
system has much to teach us about the underlying similarities of writing in 
all times and places and corrects longstanding notions about the supposed 
superiority of Western alphabets.
The “Chinese Language”
• 
The Chinese script is known as Hànzì, a Mandarin Chinese term 
that means, essentially, “Chinese characters.” The Han are a 
dominant Chinese ethnic group, and Han was the name of a dynasty 
that ruled China from the 3rd century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D. 
Chinese writing is also the source of several other Asian scripts, 
including those of Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.
• 
What we might think of as the “Chinese language” is, in fact, eight 
mutually unintelligible regional languages, each of which contains 
numerous dialects. These eight regional languages, which include 
Cantonese and Mandarin, are all members of the Sino-Tibetan 
language family. For most of its history, China’s capital has been 
in the Mandarin-speaking region; thus, Mandarin has become the 
national common tongue. 
○
○
Today, about 70 percent of modern Chinese people, regardless 
of their first language, have learned to speak and read Mandarin. 
○
○
In contrast, only 5 percent of Chinese people speak Cantonese 
as their first language.

40
Lecture 5: Chinese—A Logosyllabic Script
• 
It’s sometimes said that speakers of Mandarin or Cantonese, who 
can’t understand one another if communicating in person, can 
nonetheless communicate in writing. People believe that Chinese 
writing bridges languages. Some have even extended this idea to 
include Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese speakers, because these 
languages have borrowed Chinese characters for their own scripts.
○
○
In fact, speakers of Cantonese and other Chinese languages 
cannot 
understand 
modern 
written 
Chinese 
without  
learning Mandarin.
○
○
Remember our basic definition of a writing system: Writing 
systems transcribe the sounds of a language. And the sounds 
of Mandarin, not to mention its grammar and vocabulary, are 
different enough from other Chinese languages that one can’t 
understand the written language without understanding the 
spoken one.
Earliest Chinese Script
• 
Chinese writing has been in continuous use for almost 3,400 
years. Linguists divide the evolution of Chinese script into four 
major stages: The Great Seal script was used by the Zhou dynasty 
(c. 1028–221 B.C.); the Small Seal script, by the Qin dynasty (c. 
221–206 B.C.); and the Regular script, by the Han dynasty (206 
B.C.–A.D. 220). The aptly named Simplified script was introduced 
by the Communist Party in the 1950s. 
• 
The earliest known Chinese writing is found on objects called Shang 
oracle bones, dating from about 1400 to 1200 B.C. Diviners used 
these objects to answer questions about the future and to determine 
auspicious days for all kinds of endeavors. Unfortunately, the early 
examples of Chinese writing on these bones are difficult to interpret 
today. Some of the characters are undoubtedly pictographic in 
origin, but others are indecipherable. 
• 
Of the 4,500 or so Shang signs known, only 25 percent have been 
convincingly associated with later Chinese characters. The others 
have simply disappeared during the past 3,000 years, even as 

41
thousands of new signs were being invented. By the time of the Han 
dynasty, there were about 10,000 characters. By the 12th century, 
there were 25,000, and by the 18th century, almost 50,000. Today, 
a core set of about 2,400 characters is enough to read the average 
Chinese newspaper, magazine article, or novel.
○
○
A Shang sign that is still in use today, although in a different 
form, is the ma sign. It began as a recognizable portrait of a 
horse, but it was simplified, stylized, and even conventionalized 
over time. 
○
○
The symbol can still be used to write horse, but it is most 
frequently used as a phonetic sign, helping to spell other words 
that are unrelated to horses.
Chinese Character Types
• 
Like signs in other complex writing systems, Chinese characters are 
of several different types, with somewhat different origins and uses. 
Conventionally, these are divided into five groups, and the ma sign is 
an example of the first group, the logograms. The pictorial origins of 
such signs are clear, particularly in their earliest stages, though all of 
them experience stylization and simplification over time.
• 
The second group of Chinese signs comprises representational signs. 
Not strictly pictographs, these signs instead represent their referents 
in clever ways. Good examples are the signs for the numbers 1, 2, 
and 3, represented by groupings of one, two, or three strokes. 
• 
The third group of signs includes relational units, the combination 
of two preexisting signs to convey a third concept. A popular 
example is the combination of the logograms for sun and moon to 
convey the general idea of “brightness.” 
• 
The fourth group consists of rebus signs. In Chinese, these are 
pictographic signs that convey sound rather than meaning. 
• 
The fifth and most important type of Chinese character is called 
phonetic-semantic, and it combines two different signs. The first 

42
Lecture 5: Chinese—A Logosyllabic Script
is a semantic sign indicating part of the meaning of a word. The 
second is a phonetic sign partly indicating its pronunciation. These 
characters are important because Chinese has many homophones.
○
○
Part of the reason for this is that Chinese is a tonal language; 
Chinese tone comes from words losing their final consonants 
over time.
○
○
Depending on the specific consonant that was lost, the tonal 
quality may be rising, falling, or both in the space of one 
vowel. The reason the tones are retained instead of themselves 
being lost is because they’re useful. Tones in Chinese help to 
differentiate between words that would otherwise be exact 
homophones.
○
○
The fifth group of Chinese sign types, phonetic-semantic, 
doesn’t capture the actual tones of the Mandarin language, but 
it guides knowledgeable readers with subtle clues about the 
intended message.
○
○
As we’ll see, many other writing systems behave in exactly 
the same way, including Egyptian hieroglyphs, Mesopotamian 
cuneiform, and Mycenaean Linear B. Signs providing phonetic 
and semantic information work in tandem in all these scripts, 
reducing ambiguity to a manageable level.
• 
The semantic signs in Chinese writing are sometimes called 
taxon signs or radicals. Large numbers of characters can be grouped 
according to whether they contain the semantic signs for person, 
hand, water, wood, insect, and so forth. In fact, that’s how most 
popular dictionaries of Chinese characters are organized. 
○
○
Apart from Chinese dictionaries produced by Western 
scholars, there’s no such thing as an alphabetic ordering or 
grouping of Chinese words by sound. Instead, the search 
for a word in a Chinese dictionary begins with the section 
containing its semantic element, after which the character can 
be located in a subsection based on the number of strokes in 
its phonetic element.

43
○
○
This system has undoubtedly helped to fuel the notion that 
Chinese characters are composed of meanings and abstract 
organizational features rather than the sounds of the Mandarin 
language. In reality, however, the shared phonetic signs of 
most Chinese characters would also make a reasonably good 
ordering system.
• 
During the Communist Revolution of the 1950s, the Romanized 
writing system of Pinyin was introduced. Pinyin was intended to 
democratize Chinese literacy, but the Roman alphabet has always 
met with resistance from the educated classes. 
○
○
Nonetheless, Pinyin’s practical benefits can’t be overstated. 
Not only is it far easier to learn than traditional Chinese 
characters, but it greatly eases the task of entering Chinese text 
into computers. 
○
○
Many authorities now agree that the future of Chinese literacy 
is digraphia (the use of two scripts by the same community). 
That is, Chinese characters would not be replaced by the 
Roman alphabet but, rather, supplemented by it, leading to a 
populace conversant in both systems.
• 
The complicated Chinese sign types didn’t appear all at once. In the 
Shang oracle bone inscriptions, solitary signs were the rule, rather 
than the combined characters that are most common today. Those 
signs included pictographic, representational, and rebus signs. 
Modern Chinese script, in contrast, is characterized by combined 
characters, especially the phonetic-semantic combinations of sound 
signs and semantic signs. 
Contents of Early Chinese Writing
• 
In a recent article in the journal Antiquity, several scholars noted 
that the Shang oracle bones appear in a markedly ceremonial 
context and argued that early divination practices provided the 
motivation for Chinese writing. In a similar way, the earliest 
attested writing systems of Mesopotamia and Crete are often argued 

44
Lecture 5: Chinese—A Logosyllabic Script
to have developed from the needs of early bureaucrats to maintain 
detailed records of taxation and tribute.
• 
Such arguments tend to confuse the first evidence of writing in a 
region with its actual origin, yet we all know that archaeological 
evidence, 
like 
fossil 
evidence of earlier stages 
of biological organisms, 
suffers from problems of 
preservation and sampling. 
Simply put, the fact that 
a certain sample is the 
oldest writing we have 
doesn’t mean it’s the oldest 
writing there was. This is 
true of any object or entity, 
but it’s particularly true 
of writing because of its  
remarkable adaptability.
• 
In the specific case of 
Chinese writing, it also 
seems highly unlikely that 
the oracle bones reflect the 
first use of the system. For one thing, the form of these early 
Chinese signs seems particularly ill-suited to carving. Rather, 
they look like a fairly clear transplant from a painterly medium. 
It’s also true that more than 1,000 of the earliest Chinese signs 
can be traced to modern descendants, and these cover a much 
wider semantic territory than would have been needed for 
divination alone.
• 
Finally, as we noted in Lecture 2, it’s not really the first evidence 
of writing in any region that needs explanation. Rather, it is 
phoneticism that cries out for an explanation as the single 
most important shared structural feature of all writing systems. 
Neither the ceremonial nor the bureaucratic hypothesis explains 
Given the longstanding importance of 
brush calligraphy in Chinese writing, 
it’s not difficult to imagine the flowing 
shapes of certain early signs as 
having originated as ink on paper.

logical explanation is that writing was developed precisely to 
transcribe sounds.
character: A complex sign in Chinese writing, most often composed of a 
phonetic sign and a semantic sign, but other combinations are also known.
dialect: A variant form of a language, usually defined by region, class, or 
socioeconomic group and distinguished from other variants by pronunciation, 
vocabulary, and grammar.
digraphia: Refers to a situation in which two different scripts are used 
by the same community, usually for different purposes. Modeled on the

two languages in a single community.
Hànzì (also Hanzi): Literally, “Han sign”; the Mandarin term for  
Chinese characters.
phonetic-semantic sign: Refers to the most common kind of Chinese 
character, which combines a semantic sign indicating the semantic class of a 
word with a phonetic sign indicating its pronunciation (minus tone).
Pinyin: The standard system of Romanized spelling for transliterating 
Chinese writing; from Mandarin 
, pīn-yīn, literally “spell-sound.”
rebus: A principle of logophonetic scripts whereby a logogram is used for 
its phonetic value to signal a homophonous word (e.g., Mayan BAAH, 
“gopher,” used to write baah, “head”).
relational unit (or relational sign): A type of logogram in which two 
preexisting signs are combined to convey a third concept, as when the 
Chinese logogram 
, rì (“sun”), and 
, yuè (“moon”), combine to form 
 
, míng (“bright”).

semantic sign (also determinative, taxon, or radical): A sign without a 
phonetic value of its own, but which signals the semantic class to which 
an associated logogram or group of phonetic signs belongs. What Linear B 
scholars traditionally call an ideogram is, thus, a semantic sign.

many other languages of southern and southeast Asia. Tonal contrasts are a 
common feature of these languages. 
tone: Refers to a phonemic pitch carried by vowels, as in Chinese and other 
Sino-Tibetan languages. Tone usually results from compensation for the loss 
of earlier consonants.

ith its lengthy traditions, artistic sophistication, and military might, 
Chinese civilization dramatically influenced all that came into 
contact with it. Just as Western civilization looks to Greece and 
Rome for the origins of its cultural traditions, so, too, do Korea, Japan, and 
Vietnam look to China. Although the Koreans and Vietnamese have now 
largely replaced Chinese characters with new alphabets, the Japanese still 
retain their borrowed script, and the story of the adaptation and alteration of this 
writing system over the past 15 centuries is both fascinating and instructive. 
As we’ll see, Japanese writing is the most complicated writing system ever 
devised, yet it’s used on a daily basis by more than 100 million people.
Development of Japanese Writing
• 
Chinese characters first came to Japan in the 1st century A.D., in 
the form of Chinese inscriptions on official correspondence and 
on imported luxury items. Chinese coins bearing inscriptions have 
been found from the same period at numerous archaeological sites in 
Japan. Prior to contact with China, Japan had no writing of its own.
• 
Initially, the Japanese must have valued the prestigious appearance 
of Chinese signs, coming as they did from an ancient and complex 
agricultural civilization from which so much else was being 
borrowed. Or perhaps it was only an accident that desired art 
objects and coins came with artists’ signatures and other Chinese 
signs affixed. Regardless of the precise context of this borrowing, it 
was about 2,000 years ago that writing arrived in Japan.
• 
An early-8th-century document chronicles the histories of the 
first emperors of Japan. Called the Kojiki, or “Record of Ancient 
Matters,” it notes that a Korean scholar named Wani came to Japan 
in the 5th century, bringing knowledge of Chinese writing.

49
• 
In the wake of Wani’s instruction, the earliest surviving Japanese 
documents are official correspondence dating to the late 6th and 
early 7th centuries. 
○
○
Intriguingly, these documents seem to have been written and 
read only in Chinese. As in Korea and Vietnam, the first official 
writing in Japan recorded the Chinese language written in 
Chinese characters (albeit with some Korean innovations). 
○
○
The idea that a writing system and language belong together 
is a common one. The Roman alphabet initially traveled 
as a medium for the writing of Latin, and it sometimes took 
centuries for borrowers to begin using it to record their own 
vernacular languages. 
• 
Relatively speaking, it didn’t take long for the Japanese to begin 
adapting Chinese writing. The process began in the late 5th century 
A.D. and immediately had to contend with pronounced differences 
between Chinese and Japanese. 
○
○
Chinese is what linguists call an isolating language, which 
means that it has many invariable words. This helps to explain 
the structure of Chinese writing, in which each character 
roughly stands for one of these words, even though most 
characters are composed of phonetic and semantic elements.
○
○
The structure of the Japanese language is quite different, more 
reminiscent of Indo-European languages, with rich derivations 
and inflexions. This important difference has profound 
implications for the way Chinese signs had to be adapted to 
record the Japanese language. 
The Kanji
• 
When the Japanese first began to adapt the Chinese script, they 
had already borrowed thousands of Chinese words and had been 
exposed to Chinese writing for centuries. For these reasons, coupled 
with the lack of any other role model, it was only logical to write 
the borrowed vocabulary with the signs already used to write them 
in China and that the Japanese had already practiced.

50
Lecture 6: Japanese—The World’s Most Complex Script
• 
Although the Japanese kanji are essentially just Chinese Hànzì 
drafted into service to write Japanese, remember that this borrowing 
took place 1,500 years ago. There are now numerous differences 
between these two scripts. 
• 
As we’ve already seen, the Hànzì are written in Mandarin Chinese, 
and the characters usually have one invariant pronunciation in that 
language. But the kanji have multiple readings. 
○
○
The on reading is the modern Japanese approximation of 
the Chinese pronunciation of the character at the time it was 
borrowed. Because Japanese continued to borrow Chinese 
vocabulary over centuries, and because some kanji were 
borrowed from different regions of China (or even from 
Korea), there are sometimes several historical and regional 
Chinese readings for a single sign. 
○
○
In contrast, the kun reading of a kanji is based on the 
pronunciation of a native Japanese word that closely 
approximated the meaning of the Chinese character at the time 
it was borrowed. As with the Chinese readings, there can be 
multiple Japanese readings for the same kanji, and some kanji 
have no Japanese readings at all, as when the borrowed concept 
had no exact equivalent in Japanese, such as place names and 
other proper nouns. 
• 
Chinese and Japanese also differ because hundreds of new kanji 
characters have been created in Japan during the past 1,500 years, 
and many older kanji characters have been given new meanings. 
These additions and alterations represent further differences 
between the original Hànzì and derived kanji.
• 
In post–World War II Japan, there were several attempts to 
simplify the kanji, with rather mixed results. As noted in the last 
lecture, postrevolutionary China of the 1950s also saw several 
attempts at Hànzì simplification, again with mixed results. Because 
the two attempts at simplification were uncoordinated, the only 
unambiguous result has been that many originally identical Hànzì 

51
and kanji characters now 
have 
different 
shapes, 
meanings, and phonetic 
values in the two systems.
The Kana
• 
The 
late-5th-century 
man’yogana system began 
as a mode of using Hànzì 
for their sound values 
to write Japanese. There 
was a great deal of early 
variation in this usage, but 
over time, scribes began 
to settle on specific signs, 
even simplifying them and 
creating a visual distinction 
between word-based kanji 
and sound-based kana.
• 
Phonetic 
scripts, 
such 
as the kana, are what 
linguists call syllabaries: signs standing for whole syllables 
composed of a vowel or a consonant-vowel combination. In 
Japanese, the kana have 48 characters representing the various 
syllables of the Japanese language. There are also several diacritics 
that indicate variable pronunciations of the signs to which they  
are attached.
• 
Two distinct sets of kana evolved over time: a plain variant used for 
literary and official documents and a cursive variant mostly used 
for correspondence. 
○
○
The characteristically straight strokes, angular corners, and 
somewhat simpler shapes of the official script developed into 
the katakana. 
Japanese writing is the most 
complex writing system ever devised, 
yet Japan has one of the highest 
literacy rates in the modern world.

52
Lecture 6: Japanese—The World’s Most Complex Script
○
○
The characteristically rounded cursive kana syllabary 
developed into the modern hiragana script. 
• 
The invention of the kana scripts had an additional useful outcome. 
Traditionally, Chinese was written downward in columns and from 
right to left. The early system also lacked punctuation and mandated 
the regular spacing of characters and their placement in predictable 
blocks of consistent shape. 
○
○
Interpreting these monolithic blocks of text represented no 
great difficulty for the readers of an isolating language, such 
as Chinese, but it presented immeasurable difficulties for the 
reader of an inflectional language, such as Japanese. 
○
○
Probably for this reason, the alternation of now visually distinct 
kanji and kana in the Japanese writing system helps to produce 
minimal word separations for the reader. 
Modern Usage of the Kanji and Kana
• 
The kanji, in their various readings, are used to write all of the 
essential roots of the Japanese language: proper and common 
nouns, adjectives, and verbs. 
• 
The hiragana are used to write inflectional endings on verbs and 
adjectives, particles, and miscellaneous words that either have no 
kanji or whose kanji are considered too obscure to read. Hiragana 
also provide useful clues for reading kanji.
• 
The katakana are used for onomatopoeia, interjections, and 
emphasis; for words and names from foreign languages 
(not including Chinese); and occasionally for indicating the 
pronunciation of obscure or novel kanji. 
Maintaining an Intricate System
• 
Given the complexity we find in Japanese script, it’s not surprising 
that Korea and Vietnam have rejected their earlier Chinese-
derived scripts in favor of alphabets. The forces of conservatism, 

53
nationalism, and practicality tend to explain why Japan has not 
done likewise.
• 
All writing systems tend to be conservative. This has a 
practical component because earlier records would all need to  
be rewritten should a writing system be abandoned or  
significantly transformed.
• 
Consider, too, the prestige of this ancient script, unique compared 
to anything in the West, and the long literary tradition in both Japan 
and China, stretching back 1,500 and 3,400 years, respectively. To 
give up their distinctive writing, however beneficial, would be to 
lose their cultural distinction from the West. 
• 
Finally, recall the large influx of Chinese loanwords and Sino-
Japanese coinages in Japanese. If homophones are common in 
Chinese compared with English, then they truly abound in Japanese. 
Moreover, in borrowing many Chinese words,  Japanese leveled 
crucial tonal and consonantal distinctions, turning numerous 
Chinese sound-alikes into precise homophones and producing a 
truly ambiguous vocabulary. 
• 
For these reasons, a phonetic script alone is not adequate to the 
task of writing the Japanese language. Even the native katakana, 
which can function as a kind of phonetic alphabet, wouldn’t be up 
to the challenge. Rather, a logographic script, supplemented by 
sound signs to address derivations and inflections, more usefully 
disambiguates the thousands of Japanese homophones.
Japanese Civilization
• 
The Japanese script not only reflects cultural traditions very 
different from those of the West, but it has also, in turn, imparted 
something to them. Japanese society was long characterized by an 
aristocratic leisure class whose only occupation was the production 
of cultural norms for civilized living. More concerned with baroque 
refinement than practicality, this class left an indelible imprint on 
Japanese writing. 

54
Lecture 6: Japanese—The World’s Most Complex Script
• 
During the Heian period, between A.D. 794 and 1185, Buddhist, 
Taoist, and other Chinese influences were at their height in Japan. 
This period is widely considered the peak of the Japanese imperial 
court, noted for its art, poetry, and literature. 
○
○
What’s less commonly known is that the prestigious kanji were 
still the plaything of educated Japanese males during this period. 
Only the relatively lowly hiragana were available to women. As 
a result, some of the most important works of Heian literature 
were produced by women and written in hiragana, including 
The Tale of Genji. 
○

The irony is twofold. Not only was this masterpiece produced 
in a script that was underappreciated at the time, but we can 
actually still read Genji in the Japanese of that era, whereas 
other works produced in kanji are more semantic than phonetic, 
and scholars are not always sure how they would have been 
pronounced 1,000 years ago.
• 
But the Japanese kanji are no longer the plaything of an otherwise 
idle elite, nor are the hiragana relegated to secondary status. Rather, 
these and other writing systems are welded into a complex whole 
used by the entire literate population of Japan—one of the largest in 
the modern world.
cursive: Generally speaking, cursive refers to writing with joined characters, 
as in the longhand once taught in grade school. But some scripts designed for 
rapid writing with ink on paper are also known as cursive, such as Egyptian 
demotic, Japanese hiragana, and Aramaic abjad.
diacritic: A sign that does not have a phonetic value of its own but signals 
a change in value of signs with which it is associated. In French, when the 
letter c appears with a cedilla (ç), it is no longer pronounced [k] but, rather, 
[s], as in the word façade.
    Important Terms

55
hiragana: Japanese syllabary used to write inflectional endings on verbs and 
adjectives (behaving as phonetic complements) and to write grammatical 
particles and miscellaneous words that have no kanji or whose kanji 
are obscure.
inflectional language (or synthetic language): A language in which the 
grammatical relationships between words in a sentence are determined by 
inflections (such as case endings). Some languages, such as Nahuatl, are 
what might be called hyperinflectional, building lengthy words out of the 
agglutination of many distinct morphemes.
isolating language (or analytic language): A language in which the 
grammatical relationships between words in a sentence are determined by 
word order rather than case endings or similar grammatical inflections.
kana: Either of the two Japanese syllabaries (katakana and hiragana).
katakana: Japanese syllabary used to spell names in foreign languages (not 
including Chinese) and for onomatopoeia, interjections, and emphasis.
kun (or kun’yomi): The value of a kanji based on the pronunciation of a 
native Japanese word that closely approximated its meaning when first 
introduced. Some kanji have multiple kun readings; others, none at all.
logographic script: A writing system composed entirely of logograms. 
A conceptual category only because there are no known writing systems 
without phonetic signs.
man’yogana: The early Chinese characters used in 5th-century Japan for 
their sound values alone, eventually giving rise to the two kana syllabaries.
on (or on’yomi): The value of a kanji based on the Japanese pronunciation 
of its Chinese reading when first introduced. Some kanji have multiple on 
readings, whereas those invented more recently in Japan usually have none.

Lecture 6: Japanese—The World’s Most Complex Script
syllabary: A writing system composed, in whole or in part, of syllabic signs. 
The Inuktitut syllabary is composed entirely of syllabic signs, but most 
syllabaries are part of more complex scripts. Examples of these include 
Linear B (with its many semantic signs), Old Persian (with a few logograms), 
Mayan (with hundreds of logograms), and Japanese (with two syllabaries 
and thousands of logograms).

What Is Decipherment?
Lecture 7
I
n the last few lectures, we’ve defined writing, traced the origins of 
the earliest scripts, and charted the development of the alphabet and 
Chinese characters, the two most common writing systems still in use 
today. Before we dive deeper in our exploration, looking at the structure and 
contents of early scripts and their reflection of the sociopolitical organization 
of the early civilizations that used them, we need to discuss archaeological 
decipherment. In particular, we need to learn something about the theory and 
methodology of decipherment, as well as the evidence it considers. In this 
lecture, we’ll ask: How do we know what we think we know about ancient 
writing systems? And how certain are we in that knowledge?
Archaeological Decipherment
• 
One common definition of the verb decipher is “to convert a text 
written in code into ordinary language.” This definition assumes 
that decipherment involves an intentionally hidden or secret 
message. But specialists in the decipherment of ancient writing 
systems do not use the word decipher in this way, and there’s no 
reason to believe that early Egyptian, Mesopotamian, or Chinese 
scribes were engaged in the secret encoding of their languages.
• 
A second definition, “to interpret hieroglyphics or obscure 
inscriptions,” is also a bit misleading. Decipherment is 
much broader as a practice than is suggested by the narrow  
term hieroglyphics. 
○
○
This definition seems to indicate that only Egyptologists or those 
interested in strange, exotic scripts practice decipherment. In 
fact, archaeological decipherment concerns itself with all writing 
systems everywhere, including even the earlier attested stages of 
modern writing systems, such as the alphabet and Chinese.
○
○
The word interpret in this definition is also a bad choice 
because it carries a strong sense of subjectivity. Archaeological 

58
Lecture 7: What Is Decipherment?
decipherment is a scientific discipline that marshals evidence 
to establish the structure and meaning of ancient writing. There 
aren’t multiple interpretations of Egyptian hieroglyphs, though 
there can certainly be disagreements between scholars when 
the evidence for one theory or another isn’t conclusive.
• 
As a result of the accomplishments of early scholars in deciphering 
Egyptian hieroglyphics, cuneiform, and Linear B, the term decipher 
is now also loosely applied to anything especially difficult or obscure 
that eventually yields to understanding, such as the human genome. 
• 
Just like the definitions for writing that we looked at in our first 
lecture, those commonly used for decipher bear only a superficial 
resemblance to what specialists in decipherment mean when they 
use the term. In fact, the definition of decipher depends on what is 
meant by writing; the terms are linked. 
○
○
Those scholars who favor a broad definition of writing as 
“graphic communication” are fairly well served by some of the 
popular definitions of decipherment, especially “uncovering 
the meaning of something obscure or difficult.” 
○
○
But if by writing we mean only “visible speech”—a system of 
graphic marks that convey language through the use of phonetic 
signs—then decipherment must be defined technically.
• 
For our purposes, decipherment is nothing less than a complete 
account of sign use in a writing system, including details of sign 
types, orthography, and abbreviational conventions.
○
○
Note that this definition focuses only on the structural 
principles of writing. To decipher any writing system, such 
as ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, we need to determine first 
and foremost what kinds of signs it has and then look at how 
those signs combine to represent the Egyptian language. No 
interpretation is needed. 
○
○
Note also the word complete in our definition, in this case 
meaning “complete in intention.” Decipherment aims for a 

59
thorough understanding of the relationship between script and 
language. In real-world practice, a complete decipherment of 
many ancient scripts is probably impossible to achieve.
• 
Decipherment is a longitudinal process, not an isolated event. Not 
a year goes by without some new discovery shedding light on the 
value of a previously undeciphered sign or a new word, grammatical 
construction, or spelling rule in ancient scripts.
• 
Decipherment has its own place in the history of ideas; it’s a 
development and practice that’s unique to the modern world. 
○
○
Only in the wake of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment 
was there a sufficiently rational, empirical background in place 
that allowed the diligent comparison of complex phenomena 
to begin to yield testable hypotheses. For the first time, 
scholars could trace the origins and development of related 
entities, testing their predictions against new discoveries  
and experiments. 
○
○
It’s no accident that Darwin’s discovery of natural selection 
and biological evolution, Grimm’s law of sound changes 
in the Germanic family of languages, and Jean-François 
Champollion’s decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphic writing 
all took place within a few decades of each other in the early 
19th century. Those were great and momentous decades, during 
which the foundations of most of the sciences were laid.
Epistemology of Decipherment
• 
The word epistemology refers to a “theory of knowledge,” especially 
with regard to its methods, validity, and scope. Epistemology is 
the investigation of what distinguishes justified belief from mere 
opinion, received tradition, or authority.
• 
Historical sciences, such as biology, linguistics, and decipherment, 
consider as much evidence as possible, comparing large numbers 
of different organisms, languages, and texts. General laws are 
inductively inferred from the evidence, and those laws are then 

60
Lecture 7: What Is Decipherment?
tested deductively on new evidence as it emerges. If new evidence 
doesn’t meet the expectations of the general law, then the law is 
modified to take account of the exceptions.
• 
This process, too, never ceases. As a result, a scientific theory or 
general law becomes more robust over time, in that it is repeatedly 
challenged by evidence and improved to take account of those 
challenges. This is what defines the scientific method: Nothing 
is taken as truth based on tradition alone but on the constant 
accumulation of evidence and testing of hypotheses. 
• 
The focus of decipherment is always on the structural principles 
of writing. As long as our methods are valid, the evidence is 
sufficient to the task, and our willingness to discard untenable ideas 
is unwavering, we can assume that we’re increasingly able to read 
what ancient scribes intended. 
○
○
Note that this objective experiment in the recovery of ancient 
writing and the language it records isn’t the same thing as 
the interpretation of a text’s meaning. Here, we enter into 
an all-too-human realm where subjectivity of various kinds 
becomes inescapable. Too often, we don’t even recognize 
that we’re being subjective, so engrained are the habits and 
preoccupations of our own culture. 
○
○
As soon as the decipherer’s task is done, the comforting 
certainty of phonetic signs, logographs, and spelling 
rules gives way to a text written in a foreign language, 
with all the attendant perils of translation, not to mention 
exaggeration, bias, propaganda, and even the effects of simple  
human forgetfulness. 
○
○
Fortunately, historians have developed a successful approach 
to written records called historiography. By comparing and 
contrasting different independent accounts of past events, 
they can weigh those accounts and weed out error, whether 
intentional or otherwise. 

61
Code Breaking versus Decipherment
• 
Code breakers (sometimes called cryptanalysts or cryptographers) 
apply their trade to messages intentionally enciphered to hide 
their plain meaning. Decipherers (sometimes called epigraphers 
or epigraphists) work to understand writing systems that were 
never intended to be secret, but whose conventions have been lost 
over time.
• 
Another important difference between code breaking and 
decipherment is that cryptographers work with fewer variables  
than epigraphers. 
○
○
Cryptographers already know a great deal about the origins 
of the encoded messages they confront, including the identity 
of the sender and the language of the actual message hidden 
in the code. 
○
○
Epigraphers, in contrast, often work in the dark. Many ancient 
texts can’t be associated with a known culture or language; 
either or both may need to be reconstructed or may have been 
lost entirely. Further, epigraphers have the task of learning 
about ancient languages from the very texts they’re trying to 
decipher, which means that they often can’t rely on the favorite 
tricks of the cryptanalyst, such as frequency analysis. 
• 
Despite the differences between code breaking and decipherment, 
however, there are some similarities. When the conditions are right, 
an epigrapher may be able to guess at the underlying language of an 
ancient inscription, and provided the evidence exists to reconstruct 
some of that language independently, its patterns and grammar can 
be applied as an aid to decipherment. 
History of Cryptography
• 
Two thousand years ago, Julius Caesar designed his own substitution 
code for use during his military campaigns in Gaul, Germania, 
and Britain. Perhaps surprisingly, the Caesar cipher continued to 
be used in military engagements even as late as World War I. The 
Caesar cipher is vulnerable to so-called brute force attacks, in which

an intercepted code is 
subjected to endless letter 
shifts until the gibberish 
turns 
into 
language. 
As a result, much more 
subtle and complex codes 
emerged between the two 
world wars.

Perhaps the most famous 
wartime code was the

letter shifts and sequences) and simply typed the plaintext onto 
the keyboard while noting and transcribing the ciphered text 
lighting up the lampboard. An encrypted message could be 
read by reversing the process. The key to the system’s success 
was the frequently changing encryption key.

because it was unwritten and had never been studied by Japanese 
linguists. An additional layer of code was used on top of the Navajo 
language to enable the inclusion of such terms as aircraft carrier, 
plane, and so on.
• 
As we said, the variables involved in decipherment are generally 
much greater than those in code breaking, and sometimes, they 
can’t be resolved. Indeed, decipherment is mostly a process of 
solving for variables. Where the right conditions exist, epigraphers 
are able to puzzle out the details of lost scripts and their underlying 
languages. Where the right conditions are wanting, epigraphers 
have learned that an attempted decipherment may be little better 
than a guess.

The Five Pillars of Decipherment
Lecture 8
I
n this lecture, we explore what the Mayanist Michael Coe has called the 
“five pillars of decipherment.” At least a few of these pillars have to be 
in place before any decipherment of an ancient script is even possible, 
and all of them are necessary if we are to recover a complete picture of 
an ancient writing system. Understanding the five pillars goes a long way 
toward explaining why some writing systems were seemingly deciphered so 
quickly, while others took many years of concerted effort and still others 
remain completely mysterious.
Understanding the Five Pillars
• 
In his accessible history of the decipherment of Maya writing, 
Breaking the Maya Code, the Mayanist scholar Michael Coe refers 
to five “fundamental pillars on which all successful decipherments 
have rested.” These five pillars are script type; corpus; language; 
cultural context; and bilingual, biscript, or constraint. 
• 
Script type refers to the idea that epigraphers must know the type 
of writing system they’re dealing with,  that is, whether it’s an 
alphabet; a syllabary; or a mixed script combining word signs, 
semantic signs, and sound signs.
• 
Corpus refers to the body of texts available for study, that is, the 
database of known texts in the writing system. This needs to be 
large and varied enough to allow effective comparisons, and there 
should be at least a few long texts, ideally with a diversity of genres.
• 
Language is one of the most important pillars. Put simply, 
the language recorded by an ancient writing system must be 
independently known. If the language itself has vanished, then 
it must be possible to reconstruct it on the basis of recorded 
dictionaries or grammars or by comparison with languages to which 
it is related. 

66
Lecture 8: The Five Pillars of Decipherment
• 
Cultural context refers to the idea that traditions and histories 
giving place names, royal names, and titles should be independently 
known. Such information provides an important target for 
decipherment, which almost always focuses on proper names 
written phonetically. 
• 
Finally, bilingual, biscript, or constraint refers to certain types of 
critical clues on which decipherment depends. 
○
○
The most useful of these is a bilingual or multilingual 
inscription (such as the Rosetta Stone), at least one member 
of which is in a known writing system recording a known 
language. This allows the epigrapher to hunt for the proper 
names of the known inscription in the unknown one, making 
initial guesses (subject to further testing) as to the values of 
some of its signs. 
○
○
If there are no bilinguals, the corpus should at least contain 
some texts closely associated with illustrations (picture 
biscripts) or other similar constraints providing clues to sound 
values or meanings.
• 
The five pillars are not only preconditions that make decipherment 
possible, but they’re also measures of the amount that can be 
learned from any given ancient script. Just as multiple bilinguals 
with multiple writing systems increase our certainty of the sound 
values of an ancient script, so, too, does the presence of each 
additional pillar add substantially to the foundational strength of  
a decipherment. 
• 
The best-known ancient writing systems are those supported 
by all five pillars. Writing systems without any of these pillars 
remain undeciphered. In between is a spectrum of scripts running 
from the undeciphered through the poorly known to the slightly  
better known. 

67
Typology of Writing
• 
The typology of writing is a classification of writing systems 
according to their various types. As we’ve seen, all known writing 
systems are at least minimally alike in that they all contain phonetic 
signs (that is, signs conveying sound). Yet many writing systems 
contain other types of signs that combine to give each script its 
own unique character. The three main types of signs are logograms, 
phonograms, and semantic signs.
• 
A logogram is a sign representing a given word in a language. This 
concept is a bit more difficult than it seems. 
○
○
Some words are themselves compounds of two other words 
(e.g., snowman). Words can also be made up of several smaller 
pieces that linguists call morphemes—the smallest indivisible 
unit of meaning in a language.
○
○
A crucial point is that logograms are never just signs for ideas 
or concepts. They are always mapped one-to-one to a word 
in a given language. The distinction between word and idea 
is an important one, because it means that logograms convey 
both sound and meaning. That is, they are indexically linked 
to the pronunciation of a given word in a language, while also 
transmitting the meaning of that word. 
○
○
Logograms are present in all of the world’s writing systems. 
Logograms in our alphabet include the Arabic numerals 1 and 
4 (when used in rebus fashion for its sound value alone, e.g., 
4ever), the ampersand sign (&), and the “at” sign (@).
○
○
Logograms in the world’s writing systems have varied origins, 
but what unites them all is that their function in a given writing 
system is to represent a single word within the language.
• 
Phonograms, the second major sign type, represent only sound, 
never meaning. 
○
○
We’re naturally most familiar with the mixture of signs for 
single consonants and vowels that characterizes our own 

68
Lecture 8: The Five Pillars of Decipherment
alphabet. And if we think back to the origins of our alphabet 
in the Phoenician abjad, we can comprehend a different set of 
phonetic signs representing only consonants.
○
○
Apart from signs for single consonants and single vowels, 
we’ve also seen phonetic signs in Chinese and Japanese writing 
that take the form of full pronounceable syllables. These so-
called syllabic signs cue either pure vowels (such as i, e, a, 
o, u) or a consonant followed by a vowel (such as na). Other 
writing systems have still other shapes for their phonetic signs, 
such as several of the older cuneiform scripts. 
○
○
Because of this variation, phonetic signs can seem like a ragtag 
assortment. What unites them is their shared function in all these 
writing systems. As signs conveying sound but not meaning, they 
can be used additively to spell words. Thus, in Maya writing, the 
signs ba-la-ma spell the word bahlam, “jaguar,” and in Linear 
B, the signs pa-ka-na spell phasgana, “swords.” 
○
○
Another shared function of phonetic signs is to provide 
phonetic complements to logograms, giving clues to their 
reading values or adding derivational or inflectional suffixes. 
We’ve seen examples of this intriguing practice in Japanese, 
where the hiragana phonetic signs are used to complement and 
derive kanji logograms. 
○
○
Like logograms, phonetic signs can also originate as 
pictographs. Recall the origins of our own letters A and B as 
early depictions of an ox and a house. And recall the pictorial 
origins of several phonetic elements in Chinese characters, 
such as the “horse” sign, ma. The phonetic signs of the 
Egyptian hieroglyphs, Sumerian cuneiform, and Mayan and 
Aztec writing also derive from pictures of objects and entities.
• 
The third major sign type, semantic signs, are sometimes called 
determinatives, taxon signs, or radicals. Unlike logograms and 
phonetic signs, semantic signs have no sound value. They also aren’t 

69
linked to specific words of a language. Instead, they convey concepts 
or ideas, but they don’t do so alone. Rather, semantic signs always 
appear alongside logograms and phonetic signs to help disambiguate 
the semantic range (or meaning) of the words being spelled. 
○
○
As we saw in Lecture 5, the most common type of Chinese 
character is the phonetic-semantic type, which combines 
a phonetic sign (partially spelling a word, though without 
indicating the important distinctions of tone) and a semantic 
sign (helping to disambiguate the many potential homophones 
of the Chinese language). 
○
○
Egyptian hieroglyphs work the same way and for a similar 
reason. Because Egyptian scribes did not write vowels, 
hieroglyphs provide only the consonantal skeletons of words, 
leaving a great deal of ambiguity for the reader. The semantic 
signs serve to alleviate this ambiguity, indicating that a 
particular group of phonetic signs is to be interpreted as a word 
meaning “skin, mammal, or leather” or “small, bad, or weak.” 
Sign Counts
• 
The structure and behavior of these sign types has implications 
for the number of signs a writing system has. Provided there are 
enough examples of a writing system (that is, a sufficiently large 
and well-recorded body of texts), epigraphers can actually derive 
a more-or-less accurate idea of the type of writing system just by 
counting the number of visually distinct signs. 
• 
Granted, some signs have multiple values, and it’s not always easy 
to tell apart signs that are truly distinct from signs that merely 
appear distinct because of different handwriting, regional variations, 
or change through time. But this unavoidable uncertainty is only 
significant in writing systems that already have a large number of 
different signs, which already puts them in one of the categories.
• 
Michael Coe assembled a useful chart indicating the number of 
distinct signs in several writing systems, ancient and modern.

70
Lecture 8: The Five Pillars of Decipherment
○
○
Certain scripts, such as Chinese and Egyptian, have thousands 
of signs because they contain many logograms, phonograms, 
and semantic signs. 
○
○
Other structurally similar scripts, such as Sumerian and 
Mayan, have fewer signs, but the number is usually still in  
the hundreds. 
○
○
Syllabaries do not have nearly as many signs as Mayan but still 
have two to three times as many signs as alphabets, because 
they combine consonants and vowels into the same sign. 
○
○
Such scripts as our alphabet are all consonants and vowels, 
with only a few logographs and semantic signs; thus, they have 
a relatively small number of signs overall. 
• 
There’s an overlap between alphabets and consonant-only scripts 
(abjads), which means that we can’t be certain from sign counts 
alone whether scripts with 30 or so signs definitely have vowels 
or not. Similarly, some alphabets with large numbers of signs can 
enter the distribution of syllabaries with low numbers of signs; thus, 
it’s also not always possible to distinguish syllabaries and alphabets 
on sight. 
• 
But the high, middle, and low ends of the distribution remain neatly 
separate. On the basis of sign count alone, scholars usually know 
if they’re dealing with a mixed logosyllabic or logoconsonantal 
script, a syllabary, or an abjad. As we’ll see, this is a remarkable 
boon for decipherment.
• 
All known writing systems, ancient and modern, fall into one of 
the types described here, with some complications regarding scripts 
with low sign counts. By an interesting accident, the two major 
systems of writing still in use today (the alphabet and Chinese 
characters) also exemplify two of the major typological categories 
of writing. 

71
• 
To summarize, mixed scripts all have logographs, phonetic signs, and 
semantic signs. Syllabaries all have signs representing pronounceable 
combinations of sounds (that is, syllables), sometimes combined with 
logographs and semantic signs. Alphabets and abjads all have signs 
for minimally contrastive speech sounds, occasionally with some 
logographs and semantic signs.

English word tapping is composed of two morphemes: the verbal root 
tap and the bound morpheme -ing, indicating a participle or gerund. (The 
doubled p is an orthographic device cueing the short vowel of tap in tapping, 
rather than the historic long vowel of tape in taping.)
phonetic complement: A phonetic sign used to clarify the reading of an 
associated logogram, indicating (and at least partially reiterating) its reading. 
Often, this is done to provide a grammatical inflection to a verb root provided 
by the logogram, as in Japanese and Mayan.
phonetic sign (or phonogram): A sign for an abstract sequence of sound. 
Phonetic signs do not carry meaning and come in numerous formal varieties, 
including consonants (C), vowels (V), consonant groups (CC and CCC),

consonant-vowel groups (CV), vowel-consonant groups (VC), and even 
consonant-vowel-consonant groups (CVC). But no script has all of these 
forms. For instance, Egyptian phonetic signs are only C, CC, and CCC (e.g., 
n, nb, and nfr) and Maya phonetic signs are only V and CV (e.g., a and ka).
picture biscript: A close association between text and image (as in a caption), 
whereby the image provides a helpful constraint on the meaning of the text.
syllabic sign (or syllabogram): A phonetic sign representing a pronounceable 
syllable and, therefore, always including a vowel either alone or preceded 
and/or followed by a consonant. For example, the Maya signs a and ka are 
syllabic signs, as are the Aztec signs o, to, and ol.

Lecture 9
I
n the last lecture, we learned that epigraphers have long exploited the 
inherent formal variation of writing systems. Simply by counting the 
number of visually distinct signs, scholars can broadly determine the 
type of a given writing system. This visual dimension of writing explains 
why our discussion of script typology has until now been focused on the 
graphic variation of signs. We’ve also observed that the visual nature of 
writing inevitably interacts with the medium on which it’s recorded; that is, 
writing is not itself a medium but relies on other media for its transmission. 
It’s this materiality of writing that concerns us in this lecture. We turn now 
to the second pillar of decipherment: the corpus, or body of texts available 
for study. 
Requirements for a Corpus
• 
Scholars can’t decipher a writing system without a large body of 
texts from which to draw examples, deduce patterns, and test 
hypotheses. Ideally, the texts should be of different types and 
lengths and represent a variety of different subjects.
• 
The undeciphered Indus script, used in what is now Pakistan 
between the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C., serves as an example here. 
○
○
This writing system is known from thousands of different texts 
on small soapstone seals (and their impressions in clay), yet all 
of these texts are short, and all of them probably give only the 
names and titles of their owners.
○
○
In this instance, we lack most of the other pillars. Scholars 
aren’t certain about the language or the cultural context of 
Indus civilization, and there are no bilinguals, biscripts, or 
other constraints. The sheer monotony of the Indus corpus 
frustrates decipherment. These short texts with their seemingly 
relentless focus on names and titles give us few of the patterns 
and repetitions we need for decipherment.

75
○
○
Of the five pillars, only the type of script is known. The 
presence of 500 or so distinct signs strongly suggests that the 
Indus script is a mixed logophonetic writing system. But the 
nature of its phonetic signs—whether consonantal, alphabetic, 
or syllabic—also remains unknown, despite decades of 
intensive work. 
• 
In contrast, deciphered writing systems all have large numbers of 
inscriptions with at least some topical breadth, and most are also 
characterized by a broad materiality, appearing on numerous media. 
○
○
Egyptian hieroglyphic writing, for example, was carved on 
interior and exterior walls, on the sides of obelisks, and on 
wooden boxes. It was inlaid into gold and silver and painted on 
caskets and fragile papyrus scrolls. 
○
○
Each of these contexts conveyed different types of messages, 
giving every hieroglyphic sign in the Egyptian writing system 
ample opportunity to show itself in several contexts.
• 
The fact that scholarship requires a large number of texts of different 
types presents an unavoidable practical consideration: No one 
scholar would ever be able to gather together every example of an 
ancient civilization’s writing for private study; indeed, attempting 
to make such a collection would be ethically irresponsible. Because 
of this, the need for a broad and representative corpus carries a 
corollary requirement that texts be both accurately recorded and 
freely available to scholars. 
Recording Inscriptions
• 
Some of the earliest records of inscriptions were rubbings. This 
process works by overlaying an inscription with a piece of paper 
or cloth and then rubbing a piece of charcoal or crayon along the 
surface, catching details of the carved surface below. Rubbing was 
a favorite recording method for hundreds of years, but rubbings of 
larger inscriptions can be difficult to store and keep clean; for this 
reason, rubbing is no longer common.

76
Lecture 9: Epigraphic Illustration
• 
Making large three-dimensional copies of inscriptions—usually 
plaster casts fashioned from paper and plaster molds—was an 
important method of recording in the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries. Usually, the maker would press paper and plaster into 
an inscription, dry it out, and then carefully peel off the hardened 
paper to use it as a mold from which to cast a plaster copy. Molds 
were taken from monumental inscriptions around the world, and the 
plaster casts made from them are still found in museums. 
○
○
In some cases, early plaster casts are the only accurate 
three-dimensional records we have of monuments that were 
afterward eroded, intentionally damaged, or even destroyed. 
○
○
Of course, full-scale replicas of original monuments can be 
quite large and heavy, and the plaster is often fragile. They are 
also expensive to transport and store, which is why they’ve 
mostly fallen into disfavor. 
• 
Photography was the technology that largely supplanted both 
rubbings and plaster casts. Early cameras were large format, with 
large glass-plate negatives almost 10 times the size of later 35mm 
cameras, thereby providing a wealth of detail.
○
○
Early photographic records of inscriptions are invaluable 
to scholars because they reveal the fine incisions that can be 
difficult to capture in a rubbing and because they document 
many more inscriptions than anyone would ever be able to 
make into plaster casts.
○
○
Storage of large glass-plate negatives is difficult and expensive; 
thus, these early formats were retired as soon as the technology 
matured and miniaturized. Film cameras are now being 
steadily replaced by digital cameras, and the more recent of 
these are even beginning to approach the quality of the earliest 
large-format cameras. Digital photography is likely to remain a 
staple recording technology for the foreseeable future.
• 
Three-dimensional scanning is the newest technology to come onto 
the scene. With this approach, several cameras (or scanners) take 

77
a detailed, high-resolution topography of an object and render it 
as a three-dimensional digital model. The model can be stitched 
together with others, producing elaborate three-dimensional 
replicas of (potentially) entire temple complexes with walls covered 
in hieroglyphs.
Line Drawings
• 
Despite the use of these other technologies, most publications 
of inscriptions rely on nothing fancier than line drawings. Such 
drawings are a simple and effective way to reproduce a text for 
study by epigraphers and have a number of practical and theoretical 
advantages over other means of recording inscriptions, including 
their low cost, convenience of storage, and ease of transmission.
• 
A key advantage of line drawings from the point of view of 
decipherment is clarity and comprehensiveness. Unlike in a 
photograph, the visual field in a line drawing can be simplified and 
clarified. Scratches and gaps can be filled in, and shadows, surface 
texture, and dust and dirt can all be removed. 
○
○
A single line drawing can incorporate information collected 
from several perspectives using multiple light sources to 
maximize the contrast between the background and the text. 
In some cases, imaging outside of the visible range (such 
as infrared and ultraviolet) can be used to help reconstruct 
damaged portions of text. 
○
○
Line drawings are, therefore, composite images of a text 
that capture much more detail than may be apparent at first 
glance or with a single shutter click. They represent more than 
can be seen by the human eye under even the most optimal  
viewing conditions.
• 
Line drawings also present a few disadvantages. They don’t capture 
color, they can only approximate the three-dimensional properties 
of an object, and they are subjective.

78
Lecture 9: Epigraphic Illustration
○
○
The first disadvantage follows more from longstanding 
conventions of publication and needn’t be strictly true. Colored 
drawings and even color photographs now accompany many 
black-and-white journal articles as online content.
○
○
The second disadvantage highlights the utility of rubbings, 
casts, and three-dimensional scans, which will therefore never 
be wholly replaced by line drawings. Perhaps three-dimensional 
scans accompanying drawings in published sources as online 
content will one day become standard in epigraphy, allowing 
the reader to rotate and view the scanned inscription from 
multiple directions with multiple lighting sources. 
○
○
The third disadvantage—the inherent subjectivity of line 
drawings—has historically posed the greatest barrier to 
decipherment. Early drawings of ancient monuments were 
made before the establishment of guidelines for the acceptable 
illustration of archaeological finds. Linked to this was the 
consideration that accurate recording was seen as secondary to 
artistic interpretation or inspiration.
• 
Despite their disadvantages, line drawings remain an important tool 
for the decipherer. Epigraphers today work with any and all records 
of an inscription available to them, particularly if the inscriptions 
are damaged or unclear. But provided archaeological illustrators 
have done their jobs properly, this should be necessary only in 
extreme cases. Ideally, the illustrators themselves have weighed 
the evidence from the original texts and such rubbings, casts, and 
photographs as could be found in producing their final illustrations.
Modern Epigraphic Illustration
• 
The process of epigraphic illustration today usually begins with 
field sketches in front of the original monument. If a text is lightly 
incised, weathered, or otherwise damaged, variable light will often 
be used to bring the relief into clearer focus. The use of raking light 
cast perpendicular to the surface of the stone makes raised reliefs 

79
“pop” and tends to wash out scratches and other damage, making 
intentional lines clearer.
○
○
The tactile experience of direct contact with the stone is also 
invaluable. This is the epigrapher’s opportunity to verify the 
difference between an actual carved line and cracks, root scars, 
pitting, shadows, and other tricks of the light. Photographs are 
usually taken at the same time, with a number of light sources 
and from different directions.
○
○
Final illustrations are traced directly over photographs, 
often on acetate, vellum, or another semitransparent film, 
sometimes using a light 
table. Increasingly, these 
illustrations 
are 
made 
directly 
in 
a 
digital 
medium, using a tablet or 
similar drawing aid and 
multiple digital layers in a  
drawing program. 
○
○
Reference is made during 
the 
process 
to 
field 
sketches, 
photographs, 
casts, 
three-dimensional 
scans, and other available 
materials. 
The 
final 
drawing is then checked 
wherever possible against 
the original, at which time 
further amendments may  
be necessary. 
• 
There are two basic aims in this 
process: to reduce subjectivity 
as much as possible and to 
distill the carved monument into 
its most essential features. 
Shading, cross-hatching, 
blending, and smudging are 
the enemies of quality epigraphic 
illustration, which aims for a 
clean black-and-white image 
composed of only lines and dots.

Lecture 9: Epigraphic Illustration
○
○
Epigraphic illustration is not an attempt at realism or an 
opportunity to express oneself artistically. Rather, the 
archaeological illustrator is engaged in producing a schematic 
guide to the original monument in which all purposeful details 
are highlighted. 
○
○
All artifacts of the later history of the monument, such 
as weathering, damage, inexpert repair, and so forth, are 
presented in as straightforward and nondistracting a manner as 
possible. Interesting as they are, these are not the epigrapher’s 
main interest or concern, which remains always focused on the 
intentional aspects of the carving.
• 
Still, epigraphic illustration remains more art than science, and to 
pretend otherwise would be to deceive ourselves. And drawing an 
inscription is more than a passive recording technique. It’s an active 
process of engagement with every detail of an inscription.

Lecture 10: The History of Language
The History of Language
Lecture 10
I
n the last lecture, we considered the second pillar of decipherment: 
the need for a large, expertly recorded, and readily accessible corpus. 
In this lecture, we investigate the third pillar: the central importance of 
language. All languages change; thus, in a sense, ancient writing systems are 
moving targets. But the very fact of language change makes it possible for 
linguists to roll back the clock and predict, often in surprising detail, what 
earlier stages of languages looked like. This ability, too, is a tremendous 
boon to decipherment.
Ancient Sumerian
• 
Imagine that archaeologists excavating an ancient city discover 
tablets at least 5,000 years old. And imagine that on these tablets are 
inscribed thousands of unfamiliar pictographic characters. Clearly, 
it’s a mixed writing system, but it’s so old and so different from any 
other writing system that decipherment seems hopeless. 
• 
Eventually, after patient work by generations of scholars, it 
slowly becomes clear that this ancient writing system is ancestral 
to later ones in the same region. Although these later scripts are 
less pictorial—because their signs became conventionalized over 
time—scholars can trace their origins to the signs in these ancient 
tablets. The comparison allows the meanings of some of these 
ancient signs to be worked out. 
• 
Later traditions shed some light on the names of the ancient cities 
and rulers mentioned on the early tablets. One ancient city seems to 
have been called Warka or Erech. A bilingual inscription is found, 
and the phonetic values of many signs become apparent, as well as 
the pronunciations and meanings of a dozen words. The name of 
the ancient city turns out to be Uruk, with a semi-legendary king 
named Gilgamesh. Other words, such as lugal (“king”) and dingir 
(“god”), emerge from the mute past.

83
• 
Of course, this situation isn’t imaginary at all. It describes the 
decipherment of Sumerian, a language of ancient Mesopotamia. 
The Sumerians developed one of the earliest civilizations, but 
their language passed out of existence as a spoken tongue almost 
4,000 years ago. Fortunately, even while Sumerian was dying out, 
it was being extensively recorded by neighbors of the Sumerians,  
the Akkadians.
• 
The early Akkadians had been conquered by Sumer and had adopted 
its writing system. Eventually, however, they adapted this script 
to write Akkadian. The Akkadians continued to write prestigious 
Sumerian alongside their own language for many centuries, even 
after they had conquered the Sumerians themselves and contributed 
to the demise of the Sumerian language. 
• 
Akkadian is also a dead language, but because Akkadian was a 
Semitic language closely related to Arabic and Hebrew, scholars 
have had a much easier time deciphering the Akkadian script. 
The decipherment of Sumerian rests largely on the decipherment 
of Akkadian, and our knowledge of the Sumerian language  
equally depends on the dictionaries and grammars written by the 
early Akkadians. 
○
○
To study Sumerian, scholars must first master Semitic and 
Akkadian. Only then can they turn from the Akkadian 
dictionaries and grammars to the still more ancient Sumerian 
texts themselves. When a word or grammatical construction 
isn’t explained in any of the Akkadian descriptions, Sumerian 
scholars still debate its precise meaning, and the definitions of 
uncommon words are often not known. 
○
○
This highlights the centrality of language to decipherment. 
When the underlying language isn’t known, decipherment  
is impossible.
Reconstructing an Ancient Language
• 
All ancient languages are now dead in one sense or another. Either 
they have simply vanished, or they have continued to be spoken 

84
Lecture 10: The History of Language
over millennia, gradually changing into different languages, as was 
the case with Classical Latin. 
○
○
Latin attained a remarkable geographic spread during the 
height of the Roman Empire, and after the fall of Rome in the 
5th century A.D., various dialects of vernacular Latin continued 
to be spoken in many regions, eventually transforming into 
the modern Romance languages, including Italian, Spanish, 
Portuguese, and French. 
○
○
No language can survive without change. Even the 
Ecclesiastical Latin preserved by the Roman Catholic 
Church has undergone so many changes in words, grammar, 
and pronunciation since classical times that it would not be 
instantly recognizable to Caesar or Cicero.
○
○
Yet Latin is rightly considered one of the best known of all 
ancient languages. We have thousands of monuments and texts 
produced by Classical Latin authors. And, as was the case 
with Sumerian, the Roman alphabet and Latin language were 
adopted by numerous later groups. 
○
○
If we didn’t have any later records, the preservation of 
Ecclesiastical Latin alone would be more than sufficient to 
recover most of the nuances of Classical Latin texts. Even 
without Ecclesiastical Latin, it would still be possible to 
reconstruct much of Latin on the basis of careful comparison 
of the Romance family of languages, all descended from a 
vernacular version of Latin spoken in the streets of Rome and 
in the Roman provinces.
• 
Historical linguists long ago worked out the means by which the 
comparison of related languages could allow the reconstruction 
of their shared ancestor. This methodology, known as the  
comparative method of linguistic reconstruction, is now a well-
developed science. 

85
Case Study in the Comparative Method

Assuming that we didn’t have the Latin originals, how would 
a historical linguist go about a reconstruction? First, note that 
all of these words begin with a /k/ sound in Italian, Spanish, and 
Portuguese but a /ʃ/ sound in French. 
○
○
Actually, the French words used to begin with a /tʃ/ sound, 
spelled with the letters ch (which signal /tʃ/ in most European 
languages). It seems logical to argue that the original /k/ sound 
was retained in Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese but changed to 
/tʃ / and, later, /ʃ/ in French.
○
○
In studying and classifying sound changes over hundreds of 
years, linguists have established that the change from /k/ to  
/tʃ/ to /ʃ/ is a common one, known as palatalization, in which 
a sound moves forward in the mouth. The /k/ sound also shifts 
from a plosive to a fricative.
○
○
In fact, we have several good reasons to suggest that the first 
sound in the Latin word for “goat” would have been /k/. More 
than that, we can also say that wherever Latin had a /k/ sound, 
we should expect to see it reflected as Italian /k/ and French /ʃ/. 
The sounds of a mother tongue are systematically reflected in 
its descendants.

86
Lecture 10: The History of Language
• 
We can follow the same reasoning to reconstruct the vowels of the 
word for “goat” as /a/, similar to the first vowel in our word father. 
French is again the outlier, with /ɛ/ in each of these cases, but we 
allow the majority to rule once again and reconstruct /a/. 
• 
With the second consonant of the word for “goat,” things become 
a little more complex, because we are comparing /p/, /b/, and /v/.
○
○
The sound /b/ is what linguists call a voiced bilabial plosive; 
/p/ is a voiceless bilabial plosive. Commonly, voiceless sounds 
gain voice by infection from other voiced sounds nearby. 
○
○
Note that in the Latin word capra, there is a preceding /a/ 
and a following /r/, both of which are voiced. The original 
/p/ was probably retained in Italian, but it became infected by 
the surrounding voiced sounds in Spanish and Portuguese to 
become /b/.
○
○
French seems to have changed /p/ to /f/ first before voicing /f/ 
to /v/.
• 
We can follow a similar approach with the other sounds in these 
words. It’s clear that a fair amount of the Latin original can be 
reconstructed, although there are also a few gaps in what we can 
confidently reconstruct in this way. 
• 
If neither Ecclesiastical Latin nor any of the Romance languages 
existed, at least a partial reconstruction of Classical Latin would 
still be possible because Latin is a member of the well-known Indo-
European language family. Since the early 19th century, historical 
linguists have been able to compare these related languages using 
methods similar to those we applied to the Romance languages.
The Evolution of Language
• 
Until the late 18th century, languages were generally assumed to 
be fairly static entities, and most scholars, in part because of the 
influence of the church, tended to trace all languages, even Latin 
and Greek, back to Hebrew. The scholar Sir William Jones was the 

87
first to make the observation that Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit were 
so similar that they must “have sprung from some common source, 
which, perhaps, no longer exists.”
○
○
As it turns out, Proto-Indo-European was the ancestor of Latin, 
Greek, and Sanskrit in the same way that Latin was the ancestor 
of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French. 
○
○
Hebrew belongs to a completely different family of languages, 
Proto-Semitic.
• 
Such central discoveries of historical linguistics coincided with 
Charles Darwin’s discovery of biological evolution. Darwin’s 
evidence, too, came from the comparison of related organisms and 
the central insight that related species don’t spring directly from 
one another. Rather, as 
with sister languages, 
they must have sprung 
from 
some 
common 
source that often no 
longer exists.

The 
similarities 
between the historical 
development 
of 
languages 
and

evolution 
are striking, and they 
probably apply to all 
things that reproduce 
with small, cumulative

time.

evidence, vestigial features, and fossils to trace developments in 
their respective fields.
○
○
Consider the English word knight. Comparative evidence 
connects it to German Knecht and Dutch knecht, both meaning 
“lad, servant, soldier.” Clearly, English lost the original  
initial /k/and the medial fricative /x/, still present in the 
continental forms. 
○
○
Although k-n-i-gh-t is the spelling that survived, texts going 
back more than 1,000 years offer evidence of several attempts 
to reflect the earlier sounds, including c- before n and at least 
five different ways of indicating the fricative /x/. 
○
○
It turns out that all English words spelled with initial kn-, such 
as knee and knot, were once pronounced with an initial /k/ 
sound, as revealed by Germanic cognates. And it was the loss 
of the original internal /x/ sound that led to the lengthening of 
the preceding /i/ to /i:/ and, eventually, its development into the 
diphthong /ai/. 
○
○
The vestigial features of the modern English spelling of knight, 
coupled with fossil-like early spellings and comparative 
evidence from other Germanic languages, help us to trace the 
development of this word from Old English /knixt/ to Middle 
English /ni:t/ to Modern English /nait/. 
• 
Viewing writing systems as fossilized language is a powerful 
conceptual tool. Written forms give us a material, enduring 
landmark in a constantly shifting linguistic landscape.

and m).

comparative method: The method by which historical linguists compare 
related words in several related languages (i.e., cognates) in order to deduce 
the form and meaning of a word in their shared common ancestor.
diphthong: Complex vowels made up of two distinct vowels merged into a 
single syllable (e.g., the medial vowel ai in Modern English knight).
fricative: A consonant sound made through continuous expulsion of air past 
the point of articulation (e.g., f and sh [š]).
plosive (also stop): A consonant sound made by briefly building up pressure 
behind the point of articulation and then releasing it, as in p, b, and k.
voicing: Refers to the vibration of the vocal cords in the production of 
various sounds, such as vowels and the voiced consonants b, d, and g.

Proper Nouns and Cultural Context
Lecture 11
M
ore than 50 years ago, the distinguished Hittite scholar and 
grammatologist Johannes Friedrich concluded his book on 
decipherment with these important words: “[N]othing can be 
deciphered out of nothing.” We have already seen that epigraphers can learn 
a surprising amount about an ancient script merely by gathering a sufficiently 
large number of texts and paying close attention to the behavior of signs. 
But without external evidence of some kind, decipherment can progress no 
further. Sign frequencies and patterns of an ancient script must be related to 
something—language, cultural context, or a bilingual—to give us access to 
their contents. In this lecture, we will continue our thematic exploration of 
decipherment with a consideration of cultural context.
Proper Nouns and Decipherment
• 
As mentioned in an earlier lecture, the term cultural context, as 
it relates to decipherment, refers to the idea that traditions and 
histories giving the names of places, ethnic groups, individuals, and 
gods should be independently known. These provide an important 
target for decipherment, which has always exploited the presence of 
proper names written phonetically. 
• 
Many of our earliest inscriptions tend to record proper names. At 
the same time, nametags recording the ownership of objects and 
captions labeling figures in ancient art are among the most common 
types of ancient inscriptions. This means that names are frequently 
encountered in ancient writing systems. 
• 
Recall, too, that all writing systems have some phonetic signs, and 
that proper nouns are usually recorded with those phonetic signs. 
The main reason for this is that names, whether of people, places, 
or things, tend to be traditional and archaic. In fact, most names no 
longer have any clear meaning apart from being names.

Lecture 11: Proper Nouns and Cultural Context

○
In ancient times, of course, some names were written 
logographically. The name of the Aztec emperor Ahuitzotl is a 
good example. Ahuitzotl means “otter,” and his name-glyph is 
just a pictorially derived logogram for “otter.”
○
○
But most names used phonetic signs, either in whole or in part. 
In particular, older names whose meanings were lost were 
often written with phonetic signs. 
• 
When cultures came into contact, foreign names or titles, 
with their strange sounds and unfamiliar meanings, were also  
written phonetically. 
○
○
For instance, Champollion’s initial decipherments of Egyptian 
hieroglyphs came mostly from the names and titles of the 
Ptolemaic Greek rulers of Egypt and the somewhat later names 
and titles of Roman emperors. 
○
○
Today, scholars are using the names and titles of Spanish 
conquistadors, missionaries, and colonial governors to decipher 
Aztec hieroglyphic writing. Clearly, few of these foreign names 
and titles would have been served by indigenous logograms; 
thus, phonetic signs were pressed into service to record them. 
Herodotus of Halicarnassus
• 
The ancient Greek historian Herodotus was born in the Greek 
colony of Halicarnassus, Caria (modern-day Turkey), in about 484 
B.C. He was the son of an influential family and seems to have been 
both well-educated and well-traveled. He also seems to have been 
caught up in the pronounced political turmoil of his times. 
○
○
Herodotus’s hometown of Halicarnassus was a Dorian 
Greek colony, but it had been conquered and annexed by 
the Achaemenid Empire of Persia in the mid-6th century 
B.C., and it was a tribute-paying client of Persia during  
Herodotus’s childhood. 
○
○
Herodotus and his family seem to have been involved in 
several uprisings against a local Persian quisling and were 

93
apparently 
exiled 
to 
Samos before returning 
to assist in deposing the 
tyrant. In his late 30s, 
Herodotus relocated to 
Athens. There, he wrote 
his famous Histories in 
about 425 B.C.
• 
Given 
Herodotus’s 
background, it seems logical 
that he would write about the 
major events of his times. His 
particular focus in his writing 
was on the rise of the Persian 
Empire and the conflict known 
as the Greco-Persian Wars 
between 
the 
Achaemenid 
Empire and the Greek city-
states during the first half of 
the 5th century B.C. 
• 
Herodotus not only lived 
through these wars, but he traveled to many of the key sites 
mentioned in his books, conducting interviews and collecting stories 
to amplify his accounts. Herodotus’s researches are gathered in his 
masterful nine-volume account, simply known as The Histories. 
• 
The Histories are the oldest surviving works of Greek prose, and 
they report Herodotus’s systematic investigation into the origins, 
development, and conclusion of the wars between Greece and 
Persia, including numerous details of the people involved; the 
geography of Greece, Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and Egypt; and 
the cultures, customs, and history of the inhabitants of almost the 
entire known world in Herodotus’s day. 
The 5th-century-B.C. historian 
Herodotus is the source of much 
of our information for the cultural 
context of Old World writing 
systems.

Lecture 11: Proper Nouns and Cultural Context
• 
Cicero once called Herodotus the “father of history,” but more recent 
scholars have called him the “father of comparative anthropology” 
for his discussions of the cultural practices and beliefs of many 
different foreign peoples. In the study of writing systems, Herodotus 
contributed much of what we know about the cultural context of 
the ancient Old World. The decipherers of Egyptian hieroglyphs, 
cuneiform, and Linear B all leaned heavily on the work of Herodotus 
in helping them relate the known to the unknown.
○
○
As just one example among many of the incredible utility of 
Herodotus’s Histories, consider the famous list of the Seven 
Wonders of the Ancient World. Herodotus was the first to 
compile such a list, although the list as we have it today 
actually comes to us from Antipater of Sidon in about 140 B.C. 
○
○
Herodotus’s account of the Great Pyramid of Giza tells us that it 
was constructed as the funeral pyramid of the pharaoh Kheops 
and goes on to recount the building of the other Giza pyramids 
by Kheops’s son Khephren and Khephren’s son Mykerinos. 
The names of these early pharaohs are precisely the kinds of 
evidence that Champollion seized on in his decipherment of 
Egyptian hieroglyphs. 
• 
It’s important to note that there are some potential difficulties with 
this kind of evidence. The names Kheops, Khephren, and Mykerinos 
are all Hellenized; that is, they are phonetic approximations of early 
Egyptian names using the Greek alphabet and pronunciation. In 
popular usage, they’ve even been Latinized in their spellings and 
Anglicized in their pronunciations, such that we now write Cheops 
and Chephren with an initial C and Mycerinus with an internal c 
and u. 
Fourth-Dynasty Pharaohs
• 
Manethon (or Manetho) was an Egyptian historian and priest from 
Sebennytos, an ancient city in the Nile delta. He lived in the 3rd 
century B.C. and wrote a three-volume history of Egypt in the 
Greek language, known as the Aegyptiaca. It provides the basic 

95
chronology and division of rulers into dynasties that scholars still 
follow today. 
• 
Herodotus and Manethon didn’t agree on the names of two of 
the early pharaohs who built the pyramids at Giza. According 
to Manethon, Suphis was the name of the builder of the Great 
Pyramid, and Menkheres was the name of his grandson. 
• 
The following table compares the names of three early pharaohs as 
written in our earliest Greek accounts with the way they’re read by 
Egyptologists today: Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure.

• 
The differences between the actual Egyptian names and the names 
in the Greek and Roman sources are precisely why decipherers 
must be cautious, carefully comparing different accounts and 
keeping possible complexities constantly in mind. 
○
○
For example, imagine that epigraphers had interpreted the 
ancient Egyptian sign for f in the names Khufu and Khafre 
as p or even aspirated ph on the basis of the Hellenized and 
Latinized forms. This might be difficult to correct at first, but as 
more names were deciphered, such as those of Pepi I, Ptolemy, 
and Cleopatra, it would soon become clear that a mistake had 
been made. 
○
○
Note that it was precisely the absence of the sound /f/ in Greek 
that led the Greeks to replace the Egyptian /f/ with either /p/ or 
aspirated /ph/. But as luck would have it, Latin had no aspirated 
/ph/ sound; thus, the Romans actually turned this sound back 
into its original /f/! 

96
Lecture 11: Proper Nouns and Cultural Context
○
○
As the ancient Egyptian language became better known to 
decipherers in the light of Coptic, its descendant, it would 
eventually be noted that the sign initially and incorrectly 
identified as p or ph in fact must have been an f. 
• 
Decipherers face the constant hazard that the ancient sources they 
rely on will provide only approximate forms of names. They must, 
therefore, have at least some basic knowledge of linguistics and 
phonology to “outguess” their sources as to the proper form of a 
foreign name. 
Decipherment of New World Writing Systems 
• 
Based on current evidence, there was no contact between the Old 
and New Worlds prior to the Viking settlement of Newfoundland 
in about A.D. 1000. And knowledge of the literate civilizations of 
Mexico came only during the explorations and conquests of Hernán 
Cortés in 1518–1521. This means not only that the writing systems 
of the New World are independent of those of the Old but also 
that none of the classical authors provides any useful information  
about them.
• 
The cultural context for Aztec and Mayan writing comes to us from 
the firsthand accounts of Spanish conquistadors, missionaries, and 
colonial governors. Most important of these are the accounts of the 
first Franciscan missionaries, who arrived in New Spain in 1524. 
They quickly learned the local languages, recognizing that they 
could not proselytize in either Latin or Spanish, and they produced 
detailed grammars and dictionaries of these languages. 
○
○
Fray Bernardino de Sahagún (1499–1590) was a Franciscan friar 
and scholar who compiled a 12-volume account of Aztec history, 
culture, and mythology, known today as the Florentine Codex. 
His account is written in both Nahuatl (the Aztec language)  
and Spanish. 
○
○
Fray Diego de Landa (1524–1579) was also a Franciscan friar 
and eventually became the second archbishop of Yucatán. In 
about 1565, he authored the invaluable Account of the Things of 

97
Yucatán, referring to the peninsula on which the northern Maya 
cities were located. De Landa provided a thorough account of 
Maya history and mythology, including a detailed discussion of 
the workings of the Maya calendar, as well as several bilingual 
keys on the decipherment of Mayan hieroglyphic writing.

Bilinguals, Biscripts, and Other Constraints
Lecture 12
I
n this lecture, we conclude our thematic investigation of decipherment 
with an exploration of the fifth pillar. In relating known facts to an 
unknown writing system, few tools are more critical than the presence of 
a bilingual, biscript, or similar constraint. It’s not just a matter of potentiating 
decipherment, as we’ll see, but also of making a decipherment secure and 
detailed enough to serve as the foundation for future work. We’ll first look at 
the most famous example of a bilingual, the Rosetta Stone; then, we’ll turn 
to a more general examination of bilinguals, biscripts, and constraints to see 
how epigraphers use these tools to decipher ancient scripts. 
Napoleon’s Egyptian Campaign and the Rosetta Stone
• 
Napoleon Bonaparte’s Mediterranean and Egyptian campaign was 
a phenomenal occurrence in the late 18th century. 
○
○
Capturing Malta on his way to Egypt, Napoleon made landfall 
in Egypt on July 1, 1798. He immediately pressed his assault 
against the Mameluke regime of the Ottoman Empire, scoring 
a signal victory in the Battle of the Pyramids just three weeks 
later, on July 21. But the French fleet lost the Battle of the Nile 
against Rear Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson on August 1–3, 1798. 
○
○
Word of the British victories seemed to undermine Napoleon’s 
popular support in France, and he left Egypt in August 1799. 
Within two years, Malta had been retaken by the British, and 
the Napoleonic Fort St. Julien at al-Rashid was besieged and 
subjected to a four-day bombardment. 
○
○
The French capitulated on August 31, 1801. The British 
controlled Egypt, and many of the antiquities collected by the 
French were seized by the British navy, eventually ending up 
in the British Museum.

99
• 
Napoleon’s campaign was primarily a military venture, designed to 
protect French trade interests against the Ottomans and to secure 
a strategic base from which to undermine British access to India. 
On both of those fronts, it failed 
miserably. But on the cultural 
and historical front, Napoleon’s 
expedition remains an unqualified 
success, still heralded in the 
annals of discovery. 
• 
A brilliant propagandist and true 
student of the Enlightenment, 
Napoleon had hidden some of 
his imperial ambitions by taking 
along a veritable army of scholars 
to 
study 
Egyptian 
geology, 
flora 
and 
fauna, 
languages, 
architecture, 
and 
archaeology. 
The 
expedition’s 
discoveries 
were published in the 19-volume 
Description de l’Egypte. Its most 
celebrated discovery was the 
Rosetta Stone.
○
○
The Rosetta Stone was discovered in mid-July 1799, embedded 
in the support wall of a Mameluke fortress at al-Rashid. It 
contains three different writing systems. The bottom section is 
in the well-known Greek alphabet. The damaged upper section 
is written in Egyptian hieroglyphs, and the central section is 
written in what was, at the time, the practically unknown 
demotic script. 
○
○
The only part of the written message that could be made out 
at first was the well-preserved Greek text, but its inscription 
implied that the hieroglyphic and demotic texts conveyed the 
same message as the Greek. The bilingual key provided by 
the Rosetta Stone enabled numerous early scholars to make

Bilingual Decrees in the Ancient World
• 
Despite the stories that would like to give credit for the Rosetta 
Stone to aliens, time travelers, or even Napoleon himself, it isn’t 
an unlikely artifact at all. And although it’s undoubtedly iconic and 
important, the Rosetta Stone isn’t the only Egyptian bilingual. 
○
○
The text on the Rosetta Stone itself indicates that it was but one 
of a large number of copies intended to be set up in temples 
throughout the cities of the Nile delta, though thus far, only 
parts of two others have been discovered. 
○
○
Further, at least two earlier bilingual decrees are known: the 
Canopus decree of Ptolemy III (238 B.C.) and the Memphis 
decree of Ptolemy IV (c. 218 B.C.). Another famous Egyptian 
bilingual is the Bankes obelisk, which contains the names of 
Cleopatra III in Greek and Egyptian. In all, there are more 
than a dozen bilinguals and biscripts relating Egyptian to other 
languages and writing systems. 
○
○
Nor are bilinguals and biscripts a uniquely Egyptian 
phenomenon. They are actually fairly common wherever 
two or more literate traditions overlap in time and space. 
Thus, the famous Behistun inscription of Darius the Great 
records the great emperor’s conquests in his own tongue, 
Achaemenid Persian, as well as Babylonian and Elamite. In 
the Mediterranean, the golden Pyrgi tablets record a temple 
dedication in both Etruscan and Phoenician. 
• 
There seem to be several reasons for the proliferation of bilinguals. 
The Rosetta Stone was a royal decree, intended to be published 
throughout Egypt in all of the most important temples. It established 
the divine cult of the new ruler, Ptolemy V; granted a tax exemption 
to the resident priesthood; and indicated gifts that were to be made 

101
to the temples. In this context, the use of three distinct writing 
systems had both traditional and practical motivations. 
○
○
The hieroglyphs were explicitly the “language of the gods”; 
their use reflected the temple setting of the decrees. Demotic 
was the language of documents, and its use helped to establish 
the official status of the Rosetta Stone’s proclamations. Finally, 
the Greek language was used by the Ptolemies themselves and 
was the international language of the 2nd century B.C.
○
○
The need or desire to communicate information across 
complex, multilingual environments also explains many of 
the bilinguals that have come down to us today. The great 
trilingual inscriptions of the Achaemenid Empire served the 
practical purpose of communicating the needs and wants of the 
Achaemenids to a widespread populace, but they also sent a 
parallel message about the extent of the empire.
○
○
Asymmetrical cultural contact provides an unmistakable 
context for the production of other bilinguals, as well. In the 
New World, there’s no doubt that 16th-century bilinguals of 
Aztec and Mayan writing served colonialist ambitions to 
describe and circumscribe the indigenous population. Without 
them, we would perhaps never have deciphered these writing 
systems, yet we nonetheless recognize that these precious 
documents served as conquerors’ tools.
Multilinguals and Multiscripts
• 
The term bilingual refers to an object that bears two different 
languages, regardless of whether or not they are recorded in one 
or two writing systems. The term biscript, in contrast, refers to an 
object with two different writing systems, regardless of whether or 
not they record one or two languages. 
• 
Thus, a single object with two parallel texts can be both a bilingual 
and a biscript. An object with parallel texts in two different 
languages but using the same writing system is a bilingual, but it’s 
a uniscript, not a biscript. An object with two parallel texts written 

102
Lecture 12: Bilinguals, Biscripts, and Other Constraints
in the same language but using two different scripts is a biscript, but 
it’s a unilingual, not a bilingual. 
• 
This terminology can also be extended to contexts where more than 
two parallel texts are involved, giving us such terms as trilingual 
and triscript, quadrilingual and quadriscript, and so forth.
• 
Examples of bilingual uniscripts include street signs in both French 
and English in Canada and in Dutch and French in Brussels. In 
Hong Kong, the street signs are bilingual biscripts; they show the 
Cantonese language in Chinese characters alongside the English 
language in the Roman alphabet. The Rosetta Stone is a bilingual 
triscript, because the hieroglyphs and the demotic effectively record 
the same Egyptian language.
• 
The concept of bilinguals and biscripts is a common one in the 
modern world and is found in ancient civilizations, as well. 
This is good news for epigraphers because bilinguals remain the 
keystones of all successful decipherment. Not only do they make 
decipherment possible in the first place, but they also provide one 
of the few sure ways for epigraphers to both derive and test their 
posited sign values, increasing the certainty of their decipherments.
The Value of Bilinguals and Constraints
• 
In the last lecture, we saw that names are a critical component of 
many decipherments, and they loom large in the context of bilinguals, 
as well, because they provide a ready control for the sound values 
of signs. In decipherment, we aim first and foremost to account for 
the functions of signs, and names within a bilingual context provide 
the most economical way of getting at this information.
• 
It isn’t strictly the case that a script cannot be deciphered without a 
bilingual. The first steps toward the decipherment of Old Persian, 
Hittite hieroglyphics, and the Ugaritic alphabet were all taken 
without a bilingual. That said, bilinguals have since been found for 
all of these scripts, and in each case, the initially posited values for 

103
signs were significantly revised, placing the decipherments of these 
systems on a much firmer footing. 
• 
Of all the better-known decipherments, only Michael Ventris’s 
decipherment of Myecenaean Linear B, the ancient writing system 
of Crete, was truly pursued without a bilingual inscription. 
○
○
Archaeologists still haven’t found either a bilingual or a biscript 
for Linear B, but this script has a historical relationship with the 
Cypriotic syllabary from the nearby island of Cyprus. Ventris 
(1922–1956) was able to exploit this relationship to confirm 
certain sign values. We call these relationships constraints, 
because they set helpful limitations on the decipherment of 
related scripts.
○
○
Similarly, Linear B contains a kind of “internal biscript” that 
provided a second constraint for Ventris’s decipherment. That 
is, the script has a large number of semantic signs that serve 
to define the basic meanings of associated words spelled with 
syllabic signs. 
○
○
Linear B still remains poorly known, with several signs of 
unknown value and more with uncertain or speculative values. 
Should a bilingual or biscript ever be discovered, it’s inevitable 
that it would force some refinements on the current state of  
the decipherment.
• 
Historical relationships between scripts are important constraints 
for epigraphers. As mentioned, Linear B and Cypriotic have 
some relationship, although it’s not known whether Cypriotic 
was borrowed from Linear B or whether both descended from 
a predecessor script. In any case, the potential to decipher an 
unknown writing system on the basis of related writing systems not 
only exists but has been used to good effect in the decipherment 
of various related cuneiform scripts, such as Sumerian and Hittite, 
both deciphered largely on the basis of Babylonian.

104
Lecture 12: Bilinguals, Biscripts, and Other Constraints
• 
Picture biscripts represent another important kind of constraint. 
These are texts that appear in close association with an image, 
as a kind of caption, title, or gloss. Etruscan mirror backs are an 
excellent context for this kind of constraint, where recognizable 
images of Greek gods, goddesses, and heroes are associated with 
short captions providing their names. Picture biscripts have also 
proven themselves to be critical constraints in the decipherments of 
both Mayan and Aztec hieroglyphic writing.
Cypriotic script (or Cypriotic syllabary): A syllabary from Cyprus, 
recording a dialect of ancient Greek and dating to c. 800–250 B.C. This

Lecture 13: Egyptian—The First Great Decipherment
Egyptian—The First Great Decipherment
Lecture 13
A
lmost two centuries ago, Jean-François Champollion played a major 
role in the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs, a writing system 
that had been lost for 1,300 years. Why were Egyptian history, the 
Egyptian language, and even the workings of this remarkable hieroglyphic 
writing system so completely forgotten by the West? Why, following the 
rediscovery of Egyptian civilization during the Renaissance, did it take 
so long until these things were recovered? What guesses and evidence led 
Champollion—alone among all his contemporaries and predecessors—
down the correct path to decipherment? And what was learned from the 
decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs that could not have been figured out 
in any other way? We’ll explore these questions in this lecture.
Lost Knowledge
• 
For more than three millennia, Egypt was an imperial civilization 
of millions of people, its writings filling millions of papyrus 
scrolls and carved on thousands of monuments. It fought wars with 
other nations, forged alliances, and engaged in widespread trade 
and diplomatic communication. Yet much of our knowledge of it 
vanished for some 1,300 years. 
• 
One reason the loss of our knowledge of Egypt is counterintuitive 
is that Egypt was well known in antiquity. The great historian 
Herodotus wrote about Egypt in the middle of the 5th century B.C., 
as did Manethon of Sebennytos and Pliny the Elder in later times. 
Julius Caesar and Mark Antony both sojourned in Egypt in the mid-
1st century B.C. The lesson here is that fame is not the same thing 
as immortality.
• 
What happened to Egypt? The simple answer is that it was 
conquered—many times, in wave after wave of invasion and 
occupation, until it simply succumbed, adopting the language, 
writing, and culture of its conquerors. Egypt’s long era of 

107
sovereignty ended in 525 B.C., when it was conquered by the 
Achaemenid Persians under Cambyses. 
• 
Egypt remained part of the Persian Empire for the next two 
centuries, and Herodotus tells us that Egyptian archers fought with 
the Persian army against Athenians and Spartans at the battles of 
Marathon, Thermopylae, and Plataea.
• 
Alexander the Great wrested Egypt from Persian control in 332 
B.C. After Alexander’s death, his best friend and general, Ptolemy, 
took control of Egypt. He eventually crowned himself king and 
inaugurated the Macedonian Greek Ptolemaic dynasty, which 
ruled until the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 B.C. The Romans 
then occupied Egypt for more than 400 years, until the rise of 
Christianity and Coptic Christian rule in the late 4th century A.D. 
• 
The great library of Alexandria, storehouse of so much Egyptian 
history, was burned to the ground at this time under Christian 
edict. In the pogrom against paganism that followed, many 
Egyptian temples were converted to Coptic Christian temples, 
and the hieroglyphic characters, so closely associated with pagan 
religion, were abandoned. Replacing the hieroglyphs was the 
Coptic alphabet, a script derived from the Greek alphabet, with 30 
characters for consonants and vowels. 
• 
Arab invaders occupied Christian Egypt in A.D. 642, introducing 
the Arabic language and the religion of Islam. This led to still 
more pogroms and, in short order, to the adoption of Arabic and 
the demise of Coptic as an everyday spoken language. Coptic 
continued to exist only in the liturgical tradition of the Coptic 
Christian Church.
Erroneous Conclusions about Egyptian
• 
Neither Greek nor Roman scholars bothered to learn either the 
Egyptian language or any of its indigenous writing systems. What’s 
more, in the absence of authentic ancient knowledge of hieroglyphs, 
early writers tended to concoct their own “facts.” The early Greek 

108
Lecture 13: Egyptian—The First Great Decipherment
historian Diodorus Siculus, for example, wrote, “Egyptian writing 
was not built up from syllables to express the underlying meaning, 
but from the appearance of things drawn and by their metaphorical 
meaning learned by heart.” 
• 
The 4th-century-A.D. Egyptian 
writer Horapollo forced the few 
fragmentary bits of genuine 
lore that came down to him 
to fit Siculus’s notions about 
hieroglyphs 
as 
metaphorical 
picture 
writing 
rather 
than 
actual writing. Unfortunately, 
Horapollo’s 
writings 
were 
rediscovered and republished in 
1505 and became wildly popular. 
Horapollo’s central idea, that 
Egyptian 
hieroglyphs 
spoke 
directly to the mind without 
taking a detour through the 
Egyptian language, became the 
unshakable belief of many for the 
next 300 years.
• 
In the 17th century, the Jesuit 
priest 
Athanasius 
Kircher 
published the first European 
grammar and vocabulary of the 
endangered Coptic language, but 
strangely, he never noticed that 
Coptic was itself the descendant of the ancient Egyptian language. 
Champollion would later use Kircher’s Coptic grammar to make 
precisely this discovery, demonstrating that Coptic etymology could 
explain the few scraps of Egyptian vocabulary that had survived  
in the works of such classical authors as Herodotus, Manethon,  
and Pliny. 
Kircher had privileged access 
to Egyptian inscriptions in 
Rome, including an obelisk 
commissioned by the emperor 
Domitian in the 1st century A.D., 
but he still managed to bungle 
his decipherment badly.

109
Breakthrough of the Egyptian Expedition
• 
The turning point for Egyptian came with Napoleon Bonaparte’s 
invasion of Egypt in 1798–1801. As we saw in the previous lecture, 
Napoleon’s expedition not only uncovered the Rosetta Stone, but 
it also led to the publication of the multivolume work titled the 
Description de l’Egypte, which appeared in print between 1809  
and 1828.
• 
With the publication of the final volume, scholars immediately set 
to work to decipher the hieroglyphs. 
○
○
Noting that the names Alexander, Alexandria, and Ptolemy 
all appear in the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone, scholars 
reasoned that they should expect these names to appear in the 
demotic text, as well. 
○
○
Egyptian writing was thought to record ideas rather than 
sounds, but many scholars assumed that the Egyptians would 
have had no choice but to use some of the signs in their popular 
demotic script in a phonetic way when confronted with foreign 
sounds, such as those in Macedonian Greek names. 
○
○
This assumption was true enough, but as we’ll see, the 
implication of this reasoning—that the Egyptians wouldn’t 
write their own names phonetically—was both unjustified  
and incorrect. 
• 
By comparing the better-preserved demotic text to the Greek and 
by following the assumption that the most frequently repeating 
element in the former would be Ptolemy’s name, early scholars 
were able to isolate the Ptolemy sequence in the text. Then, on the 
assumption of general equivalency to Greek alphabetic values, they 
drew up tentative alphabets for demotic. 
○
○
The problem, of course, is that demotic is not an alphabet. Like 
the hieroglyphs, it’s a mixed logophonetic script.

○
As a result, early scholars stumbled whenever the signs they 
were examining represented words rather than just sounds, or 
when they identified signs for vowels (which don’t exist).
○
○
Unfortunately, these early scholars took their difficulties as 
confirming rather than challenging what they had imbibed 
from their classical training. They could not bring themselves 
to believe that all those pictures of hawks, crocodiles, and 
geese conveyed sounds rather than ideas. 
The Work of Champollion
• 
It was into this heady period that Jean-François Champollion 
(1790–1832) was born in a small town in southwestern France. As 
a youth, Champollion was captivated by Napoleon’s discoveries in 
Egypt. In 1808, he received a high-quality copy of the Rosetta Stone 
inscription and began to work on deciphering the hieroglyphs, an 
effort that would take him more than 14 years. 
• 
In the beginning, Champollion made the same comparisons 
that earlier scholars had made between the Greek and the better-
preserved demotic texts. Eventually, it occurred to him to simply 
count the signs of the Egyptian and demotic texts, though here, he 
ran into the same difficulty that had hampered earlier researchers: 
The hieroglyphs of the Rosetta Stone were incomplete. What he 
needed was a part of the hieroglyphic text that he could directly 
compare to the demotic and Greek to ensure that his comparison 
started in the same place. 
• 
Champollion identified a repeating element in the hieroglyphic text: 
an oval encircling several hieroglyphs. The earlier scholar Thomas 
Young had suggested that these cartouches contained the name  
of Ptolemy.
○
○
Champollion used this as his benchmark, counting the 
hieroglyphs from the last cartouche to the end of the text 
and comparing them with the number of signs from the last 
occurrence of the name Ptolemy in the demotic text. 

111
○
○
He found that they were more or less the same and came to 
realize that the scripts were really variants of each other: the 
hieroglyphs, a formal script reserved for monuments; the 
demotic, a cursive script for correspondence.
• 
This led to a further insight. Given that many authorities accepted 
that the demotic script recorded foreign names phonetically because 
of their strange sounds, the hieroglyphics must have had recourse to 
the same principle. Counting the number of signs in the hieroglyphic 
cartouches and relating them to the demotic signs spelling the name 
Ptolemy, Champollion was convinced that the name Ptolemy, at 
least, was being rendered by sound signs. He tested this idea by 
examining numerous other cartouches from Egyptian monuments 
dating to the Ptolemaic and Roman periods.
• 
Champollion was able to read the Greek title autocrator (“ruler”) 
and some Greek and Roman names, but he still labored under the 
assumption that only the names and titles of foreigners, enclosed 
in cartouches, involved hieroglyphs operating phonetically. He 
believed that the hundreds of other glyphs stood for ideas.
• 
The next breakthrough came when Champollion received the final 
volume of the Description de l’Egypte, with its detailed plates of 
the inscriptions of Ramses II, Tuthmosis III, and other pharaohs of 
the 18th and 19th dynasties. The names of these pharaohs had been 
recorded by Manethon and Herodotus, and Champollion quickly 
recognized that the same phonetic signs he had discovered in Greek- 
and Roman-era inscriptions provided their names in cartouches. 
○
○
Based on his knowledge of Coptic, Champollion knew that 
the name of Ramses was thoroughly Egyptian, meaning “the 
sun god is born.” It could no longer be argued that Egyptian 
hieroglyphs transcribed only foreign names phonetically. The 
principle was, in fact, an ancient one and had merely been put 
to new use to record the names of foreigners.
○
○
Nevertheless, Champollion attempted to explain away his own 
discovery, arguing that perhaps it was the category of names that 

112
Lecture 13: Egyptian—The First Great Decipherment
explained this usage. The inscriptions outside the cartouches, he 
believed, still communicated ideas rather than sounds.
• 
The early 1820s found Champollion working around the clock to 
solve the problem of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. Then, one night, 
he had a eureka moment. In the text outside the cartouches, he 
finally recognized an early form of Coptic. Champollion now knew 
exactly how the signs outside the cartouches functioned to provide 
the same message written in the long-understood Greek text.
• 
With his brother’s help, Champollion quickly prepared his insights 
for publication. In his Lettre à M. Dacier, he published his famous 
alphabetic table of hieroglyphs. He would eventually write 
grammars and dictionaries of Egyptian, although he died only 10 
years after his epochal decipherment, at 41 years of age.

What Do Egyptian Hieroglyphs Say?
Lecture 14
I
n the Brooklyn Museum of Art, there is a small, fragmentary wall panel 
from the mortuary temple of Hatshepsut in Deir el Bahari, Thebes. The 
panel is only about six inches high, but like much of Egyptian art, it 
represents a world in a grain of sand. Eight glyphs and two fragmentary 
images tell a compelling story about a lost world. How was this lost world 
of meaning recovered? In the last lecture, we saw how difficult it was for 
Champollion to overcome the entrenched dogma that ancient Egyptian was 
an ideographic script, even in the presence of all five pillars of decipherment. 
In this lecture, we’ll look at the contexts that first suggested values for 
individual Egyptian signs. 
A Fragment from Deir el Bahari
• 
A 3,500-year-old fragment from the mortuary temple of Hatshepsut 
depicts a king wearing the so-called blue crown (or khepresh). A 
large cartouche to the right of this figure encircles three hieroglyphs 
giving the royal name Tuthmosis III.
• 
From top to bottom, the signs represent a solar disk (r‘), a chess-like 
game shown in profile (mn), and a scarab beetle (ḫpr). All three of 
these signs are logograms, and they can be read as Menkheperre, 
the royal name taken by Tuthmosis III when he came to the throne. 
• 
Notice that the solar disk sign, r‘, is read last, even though it appears 
at the top of the column of signs. This is a tricky feature of Egyptian 
writing called honorific transposition. The solar sign is moved up in 
the text to honor it, but it’s still read last.
• 
Remember that Egyptian writing does not record vowels. Thus, 
the solar disk conveys only /r/ and a voiced pharyngeal fricative 
/‘/ (similar to Hebrew ’ayin). Scholars add the e of the popular 
vocalization re only to make it easier to discuss these ancient words. 
In fact, it now seems likely that the ancient Egyptians pronounced 

115
this word something like /ri‘u:w/. The vowels in men and kheper 
are also a convenience, not written by the ancient Egyptians.
• 
The signs to the right of the cartouche are read from right to left, 
working toward the profile of the king, and then top to bottom. 
In fact, they would have immediately preceded the cartouche in a 
reading of the whole text. Taken together, these signs can be read 
as meaning “the perfect god, lord of the two lands.” This latter title 
is a traditional one for Egyptian kings, referring to the two lands of 
Upper and Lower Egypt.
• 
Although the relief is fragmentary, the figure of the king appears 
to represent a royal statue, not a portrait, and just enough survives 
to the right to indicate another royal statue. The image probably 
depicted a procession of royal statues commemorating an annual 
festival in Thebes.
A Return to the Rosetta Stone
• 
Thomas Young was the first to prove that the Rosetta Stone 
cartouches provided the name of Ptolemy (Greek: Ptolemaios), 
though his proposal was weakened by the idea that both consonants 
and vowels would be provided (as in a full alphabet), by several 
erroneous values even for the consonants, and by his inability to 
explain why some cartouches contained more signs that others.
• 
In one of the longer cartouches, simply counting the signs yields 18 
separate elements. The shorter cartouches omit the last 11 elements; 
this suggested to Champollion that some kind of title probably 
followed the name in the case of the longer cartouches.
• 
What followed for Champollion was basically a process of trial and 
error. By proposing certain sound values for these signs (based on 
the idea that they spelled the name Ptolemaios), the signs could be 
tested in other contexts, such as the Bankes obelisk, and in other 
cartouches to see if they continued to yield reasonable results. 
Through this mechanism, Champollion eventually disproved the 

116
Lecture 14: What Do Egyptian Hieroglyphs Say?
idea that any of these signs provided vowels, because they simply 
could not be sustained with such values in other contexts. 
• 
The values that ultimately proved correct are p-t-w-l-m-y-s. Note 
that consonants alone are written, as is the case throughout the 
Egyptian writing system. Note also that all of the signs are phonetic, 
conveying single consonants only. There probably weren’t any 
logograms that would readily capture the barbaric sounds heard by 
the Egyptians in the Macedonian Greek name Ptolemaios.
• 
These sign values were greatly strengthened by being substantially 
the same ones present on the Bankes obelisk, where the hieroglyphic 
name of Cleopatra overlaps with respect to the signs for p, t, l, and 
w. Using these signs, Champollion went on to read the hieroglyphic 
names of Alexander the Great and Augustus Caesar, as well as 
numerous Greek and Latin titles.
• 
The signs following the name of Ptolemaios mean “immortal” 
and “beloved of Ptah,” an important patron god of Memphis. The 
whole cartouche thus reads, “Ptolemaios the immortal, beloved 
of Ptah.” The foreign name of this king was written with phonetic 
signs providing single consonants only, and the more traditional 
titles of the Egyptian rulers were written in a mixture of logograms, 
phonetic signs, and semantic signs. It is this mixture that is most 
representative of Egyptian writing in all periods and is also present 
in both hieratic and demotic.
• 
Given all the phonetic signs recording single consonants in the 
names of Ptolemy, Cleopatra, Augustus Caesar, Alexander, and 
others, it’s easy to sympathize with Champollion’s presentation of 
these words as the main “key” to Egyptian writing. However, we 
now know that there are several errors in Champollion’s table of 
phonetic signs, published in his famous Lettre à M. Dacier in 1822.
○
○
These 
errors 
shouldn’t 
detract 
from 
Champollion’s 
achievement. It bears repeating that decipherment is a process, 
not a solitary event. 

117
○
○
If later work has been able to show where Champollion was led 
astray by the late spellings of foreigners’ names, then this was 
only made possible because of the firm foundation on which he 
placed this field.
Damnatio Memoriae
• 
Egyptian hieroglyphs were often recarved in a practice scholars 
call damnatio memoriae, Latin for “condemnation of memory.” 
It refers to a well-known punishment of the Roman Senate, 
usually pronounced against traitors, who were literally erased 
from historical records. This was much easier to accomplish in the 
ancient world, when writing was both less common and often under 
the control of the state. 
• 
Damnatio memoriae takes several forms in Egyptian records. The 
first and most common is the literal recarving of inscriptions. A 
fragmentary carving from Bubastis, now in the British Museum, 
shows a partially erased earlier cartouche, of which the elements ka 
and r’ are all that survive. 
○
○
If the original cartouche was that of Maatkare, then this would 
have been the throne name of the problematic 18th-dynasty 
Queen Hatshepsut (r. 1498–1483 B.C.). She was the coregent 
for her young stepson Tuthmosis III before seizing the throne 
in her own right. 
○
○
When Tuthmosis III came of age, he toppled many of her 
statues at Deir el Bahari and erased her name from many 
monuments. This one escaped him but was partially recarved 
more than 200 years later with one of the cartouches of the 
19th-dynasty pharaoh Ramesses the Great (1279–1212). 
• 
Another kind of damnatio memoriae can be seen on the walls of 
Ramesses II’s memorial temple at Abydos, the cult center of Osiris. 
The middle row of cartouches on an inscription in the memorial 
provides the names of all the 18th- and 19th-dynasty pharaohs 
who preceded Ramesses the Great, with the exceptions of Queen 
Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, and Tutankhamun. The latter two are the 

118
Lecture 14: What Do Egyptian Hieroglyphs Say?
pharaohs of the Amarna heresy, who moved the capital from Thebes 
to Amarna and elevated the cult of the Aten to a monotheistic  
state religion.
• 
Damnatio memoriae teaches us that Egyptian writing was both a 
tool and a weapon of the state. Thus, scholars must be cautious in 
their interpretations of single monuments, drawing their conclusions 
instead from the careful comparison of many texts from different 
time periods and a broad region and from archaeological evidence. 
The Tomb of Senbi
• 
In the early 20th century, the Egyptologist Aylward Blackman 
(1883–1956) investigated a series of rock-cut tombs at Meir in 
Upper 
Egypt. 
One 
of these tombs was 
designed 
for 
Senbi, 
a 
“governor” 
and 
“overseer 
of 
priests” 
during the reign of the 
12th-dynasty 
pharaoh 
Amenemhet I. The tomb 
was lavishly decorated 
with 
carved 
and 
painted scenes whose 
contents bear directly 
on the Egyptian view of  
the afterlife.
• 
One of the main scenes 
depicts two tall figures, 
facing each other. Both 
stand on a small reed 
boat accompanied by 
smaller female figures. 
They float on a stylized 
River 
Nile, 
complete 
with water plants, reeds,

Abydos was excavated in the early 19th 
century; its impressive list of the kings

and rushes. The leftmost figure holds out a long spear, on which the 
bodies of two fish are impaled. The rightmost figure prepares to toss 
a curved throwing stick at a group of birds in the rushes before him. 
In his right hand, he holds some captured birds, while the woman 
below him holds other captured birds.
• 
The hieroglyphs associated with this scene read as follows: “It is 
the spearing of fish by the revered one of Osiris, the governor and 
overseer of priests, Senbi, the justified,” and “It is a throwing at 
birds by the governor, seal-bearer and sole companion of the king, 
Senbi, the justified.” The justification title is important because it 
predicts that Senbi’s soul would manage to avoid the perils of the 
Egyptian underworld and pass the final judgment of Anubis, where 
his conscience would be weighed against a feather.
• 
As we’ve seen, hieroglyphs provide a rich window into the political 
organization and religious beliefs of one of the oldest civilizations. 
Like many writing systems, the Egyptian one is a blend of phonetic 
signs, logograms, and semantic signs. Most people can easily 
memorize all the phonetic signs and many of the common semantic 
signs, enabling them to experience the satisfaction of being able to 
read words and phrases on an ancient monument.
damnatio memoriae: Latin for “condemnation of memory,” referring to a 
punishment of traitors by the Roman Senate, whose names were stricken 
from historical records.
hieratic: An early Egyptian logophonetic script designed for painting on 
papyrus. Replaced in most secular contexts by the demotic script in the 7th 
century B.C.
pharyngeal: A sound produced by articulating the root of the tongue with 
the pharynx, as in the Semitic consonant ’ayin.

Old Persian—Cuneiform Deciphered
Lecture 15
I
n this lecture, we’ll meet a high school teacher who made an 
incomparable contribution to the study of ancient writing and 
civilization. Georg Grotefend (1775–1853) was a German contemporary 
of Champollion, a math teacher, and a lover of puzzles. When the cuneiform 
writing of Mesopotamia began to come to the attention of the European 
intelligentsia in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Grotefend recognized 
a great puzzle worthy of his attention. As we’ll see, he came on the scene at 
exactly the right time, when good drawings of cuneiform inscriptions were 
just becoming available, along with scholarly analyses of Avestan and Farsi, 
critical languages for the decipherment of Old Persian.
Cuneiform Scripts
• 
The term cuneiform is Latin and means “wedge shaped.” It is 
used to describe all the writing systems of ancient Mesopotamia, 
Anatolia, and Persia, because they were formed by pressing 
the cut end of a reed stylus into wet clay, creating a wedge- 
shaped impression.
• 
Some cuneiform scripts are related, while others are not. Old 
Akkadian, for instance, was derived from Sumerian cuneiform 
in much the same way that the Japanese kanji were derived from 
Chinese characters. Different groups, such as the Elamites, 
Babylonians, and others, later borrowed this Akkadian adaptation 
of Sumerian cuneiform. 
• 
However, not all wedge-shaped scripts have this ancestry. Some, 
such as the Ugaritic alphabet and the Achaemenid Persian syllabary, 
were merely inspired by these earlier and contemporary scripts. 
They had an outward cuneiform appearance but were quite distinct 
in terms of organization and number of signs.

122
Lecture 15: Old Persian—Cuneiform Deciphered
• 
As with Chinese and Japanese writing, cuneiform represents a 
situation in which several writing systems are related, but the 
languages aren’t!
○
○
The Sumerians, who were the inventors of cuneiform, spoke a 
language that is now extinct, without any surviving relatives. 
The same is true of the Elamites and Hurrians. The Akkadians, 
Babylonians, and Assyrians all spoke different but related 
Semitic languages. Those languages have living relatives, 
including Modern Hebrew and Arabic.
○
○
The Hittites and the Achaemenid Persians spoke Indo-
European languages that were related to each other, albeit 
distantly, as well as to English, Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. The 
Hittite language has no direct descendant, whereas Achaemenid 
Persian developed into Modern Persian (also known as Farsi).
The ruins of Darius’s palace at Persepolis leave no doubt that this colossal 
structure was once the seat of a mighty empire.

• 
The three contemporary scripts Achaemenid Elamite, Late 
Babylonian, and Achaemenid Persian (also known as Old Persian) 
were all used by the Achaemenid dynasty of Persia during the late 
6th century B.C. All three scripts have different origins and represent 
unrelated languages. The contemporary use of these three scripts 
made possible the decipherment of Old Persian, as well as Elamite 
and Babylonian.
The Achaemenid Empire
• 
The imperial Achaemenid dynasty ruled a great swath of Asia 
Minor roughly from the mid-6th century B.C., under Cyrus the 
Great, to the late 4th century B.C., under Darius III. 
○
○
Although the capital of the Achaemenids was at Persepolis, 
they had conquered Egypt under Cambyses in 525 B.C. and 
then came into conflict with the Greek colonies of Sardes and 
Ionia in Asia Minor. These were quickly subjugated, but the 
Ionian cities revolted with the assistance of Athens, leading 
Darius I to invade Greece itself, though he was turned back at 
the Battle of Marathon in 490 B.C. 
○
○
The son of Darius, Xerxes I, attacked Greece some 10 
years later, leading to the brave stand of the 300 Spartans at 
Thermopylae, the sacking of Athens, and the eventual defeat of 
the Persians at Plataea in 479. 
○
○
The Persians became a traditional enemy of the Greeks until 
Alexander the Great’s short-lived Macedonian Empire at 
last conquered Persepolis in 330 B.C. Alexander burned the 
imperial capital to the ground in long-delayed vengeance for 
Xerxes’s sack of Athens.
• 
Much of what we know about the Achaemenids comes from the 
writings of Herodotus. Yet despite Alexander’s conquest and 
Herodotus’s writings, Western knowledge of Persia effectively 
disappeared with the Muslim occupation of this region during the 
7th century A.D. The rediscovery of Persia began in the early 17th 
century, when European explorers braved the Ottoman and Persian 

124
Lecture 15: Old Persian—Cuneiform Deciphered
empires to bring back accounts of great ruins and examples of clay 
bricks with strange writings.
Establishing the Five Pillars
• 
Around 1770, the Danish explorer Carsten Niebuhr (1733–1815) 
made a stop in his travels at Persepolis to copy its inscriptions. 
Although all of them were cuneiform in outward shape, he 
nonetheless recognized three different scripts with different 
numbers and types of signs; he published his drawings in 1772. 
• 
Niebuhr made a number of insightful observations on the script we 
now call Old Persian. First, given that the script used only about 40 
distinct signs, Niebuhr proposed that it was an alphabet. This idea 
influenced many scholars, including Grotefend, but it was incorrect. 
Second, Niebuhr was also able to demonstrate that the script read 
from left to right, and he identified a sign that seemed to operate 
almost like punctuation between words.
• 
Several of the pillars of decipherment were already in place by the 
time Grotefend began working. Accurate copies of the inscriptions 
of Persepolis were available; the type of script was assumed to be 
an alphabet; and thanks to Herodotus, the cultural context of the 
Achaemenids was known. The Persian language was known, and 
biscripts were available.
The Persian Language
• 
Modern Persian (or Farsi) is the official language of Iran, where 
it’s spoken by more than 30 million people. An additional 7 million 
people speak the closely related dialects of Dari and Tajik in 
Afghanistan and Tajikistan, respectively. These dialects all descend 
from the Persian spoken by Darius and Xerxes 2,500 years ago. 
• 
Modern Persian is, of course, very different from the language that 
was carved on the walls at Persepolis, but two factors combined to 
make Old Persian almost entirely recoverable.
○
○
First, a group of Persian speakers known as Parsees, 
practitioners of the religion Zoroastrianism, had preserved 

125
several sacred texts, collectively referred to as the Avesta and 
dating back to about the 4th century A.D. These texts were 
translated by the French orientalist A.-H. Anquetil-Duperron 
in 1771, and the language turned out to be an early form of 
Persian, effectively bridging the Old Persian writings of the 
Achaemenids and its modern descendants.
○
○
Second, Persian is an Indo-European language. Specifically, 
it’s in the Indo-Iranian branch of that family, closely grouped 
with Sanskrit and Hindi, but it’s also related to many other 
well-known ancient and modern languages. For this reason, 
words in Old Persian can often be reconstructed on the basis 
of patterned relationships among Avestan, Persian, and other 
Indo-Iranian languages. 
• 
Because of the great size of the Achaemenid Empire and its frequent 
diplomatic contact with its subject nations, the Persians created a 
large number of public proclamations and biscripts associating Old 
Persian with Egyptian, Akkadian, Elamite, and even Greek. 
Grotefend’s Methodology
• 
Numerous carved columns depicting the Achaemenid kings still 
stand in the ruins of Persepolis, and many of them bear short 
cuneiform inscriptions, which Grotefend presumed served as 
captions for the royal portraits. He compared these texts to copies 
of inscriptions made by Niebuhr at the site of Naqsh-e Rostam and 
was struck by the patterns he saw.
• 
A comparison of two columns at Persepolis reveals that the Old 
Persian texts have slightly different styles. They’re undoubtedly 
the same writing system, but they were made at different times and 
found in different wings of the palace. The “punctuation” sign noted 
by Niebuhr proved useful to Grotefend, allowing him to compare 
numerous inscriptions to look for common words, even without 
knowing whether the signs were alphabetic or syllabic.

126
Lecture 15: Old Persian—Cuneiform Deciphered
• 
In patterns of word repetition in the different inscriptions, Grotefend 
found indications of a shared structure. This structural duplication 
suggested that the inscriptions were formulaic, with minimal 
variation. Given the Persian rhetoric recorded by Herodotus 
and present in the Greek biscripts at Naqsh-e Rostam, Grotefend 
surmised that some of the repeating elements in these inscriptions 
might provide the words for king, great king, and son, and the 
variable elements might provide the names of the depicted kings 
and their predecessors.
• 
Again, looking at patterns of repetition, Grotefend reasoned that 
some of the unidentified first words in the inscriptions might 
provide the name of a king, after which his titles would be assigned 
in a formulaic manner. The name of the king’s father might be 
provided in the unidentified middle portion of the inscriptions.
• 
Grotefend decided to test his theory using the names of the non-
royal Hystaspes; his son, King Darius I; and his grandson, King 
Xerxes I. He equated these names with possible pronunciations 
in Old Persian (Hytaspes = Vishtāspa, Darius = Dārayavahaush, 
and Xerxes = Xshayārshā) and noted shared phonetic signs in the 
inscriptions (sh, a, r, and y) corresponding to the pronunciations he 
had posited. 
• 
Grotefend’s findings were enough to rule out coincidence. 
Nonetheless, as we know today, he was only partly right. He thought 
that Old Persian was alphabetic, but it was a syllabary. Each of the 
signs Grotefend identified was actually a pronounceable syllable, 
carrying the values of consonant + vowel (or vowel alone).
• 
Using the values he had generated from the name of Xerxes, 
Grotefend was able to read the first four signs of a frequently 
repeated word in the inscriptions as kh-sh-a-y, which he linked with 
the Avestan word khscheio, meaning “chief, ruler.” The connection 
to the repeating word for “king” in the speeches of Xerxes and the 
Naqsh-e Rostam inscriptions seemed clear. 

127
• 
Grotefend was able to the read the inscription on one column as 
follows: “Xerxes, the great king, the king of kings, the son of 
Darius the king, an Achaemenian.” Other column inscriptions at 
Persepolis are similar.
Other Achaemenid Biscripts
• 
The Achaemenids left behind many biscripts and bilingual 
inscriptions; perhaps the most fascinating biscripts are the ones that 
relate Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian to the language and 
writing of the ancient Egyptians.
• 
For example, a statue of Darius the Great was carved in Egypt 
in the late 6th century B.C. and sent to the Persian capital, where 
it was discovered by archaeologists in the early 1970s. On the 
robe and pedestal of the statue were inscriptions in four ancient 
scripts, providing the name of Darius I and his customary “king of 
kings” epithet.
• 
Equally noteworthy is an alabaster vase that came to light in Egypt 
in the late 18th century. It was described by the French archaeologist 
Caylus, but it wasn’t until after Champollion’s decipherment of 
Egyptian in 1822 that the vase could be recognized as having been 
dedicated to Xerxes I.
○
○
Some years later, as Grotefend’s work became more widely 
known, the true value of the vase was finally recognized. 
○
○
It’s hard to imagine a more eloquent defense of the correctness 
of Champollion’s and Grotefend’s decipherments than that 
both of them managed to independently discover the name of 
Xerxes on the Caylus vase.

Rawlinson, “The Persian Cuneiform Inscription at Behistun.”
1.	 What is meant by the term cuneiform? You will now begin to notice (if 
you haven’t already) a routine popular misuse of this word as implying 
that all cuneiform scripts are genetically related or even the same. 
Sometimes, the word is even equated with a language, as in “Do you 
speak cuneiform?” Where do you suppose this confusion comes from? 
How would you set someone straight about the proper use of this term?
2.	 What do you think about the preoccupation of the Achaemenid kings 
with status and genealogy in their inscriptions? Are these radically 
different from our own concerns, 2,500 years later? Why or why not?
    Questions to Consider

What Does Cuneiform Say?
Lecture 16
I
n the modern province of Kermānshāh, Iran, visitors can still see a great 
low-relief sculpture of Darius I that was carved into Mount Behistun in 
about 500 B.C. As with the Achaemenid texts of Persepolis, the carved 
figures here are surrounded by cuneiform captions and more than 1,000 lines 
of text in Old Persian script, Elamite cuneiform, and Babylonian cuneiform. 
The main message of the Behistun monument is the legitimation and 
aggrandizement of Darius’s rule, but we are lucky to have this bombastic 
ancient monument. Behistun was the final key to the decipherment of Old 
Persian and opened the door to the decipherment of Babylonian, Elamite, 
and earlier cuneiform scripts.
Deciphering Elamite
• 
As we saw in the last lecture, Grotefend had made a start on 
deciphering Old Persian by 1802, but he still regarded it as an 
alphabet. It wasn’t until the Old Persian text of the Behistun cliff 
carving was finally published in 1846 that there was sufficient 
evidence to overturn the alphabet hypothesis in favor of a syllabary.
• 
The remarkable task of recording and analyzing the Old Persian 
text of the Behistun cliff carving was almost entirely the work of 
one man, the Englishman Henry Rawlinson (1810–1895). It took 
him 10 years to do the work, crawling and climbing over the sheer 
cliff face at great risk to life and limb.
• 
The lengthy Old Persian text and many shorter captions at Behistun 
contained the names of all the most important people of Darius’s 
day. Comparing these names with their forms in Herodotus’s 
Histories allowed Rawlinson to greatly improve the sign values 
first proposed by Grotefend. Further, because Old Persian was 
part of the Indo-European family tree, scholars at last had a strong 
knowledge of at least one of the three scripts and languages on the 
Behistun trilingual.

130
Lecture 16: What Does Cuneiform Say?
• 
Next, work began on the Elamite and Babylonian texts at Behistun. 
These were copied by Rawlinson during the 1840s and proved even 
more difficult than the Old Persian. 
○
○
The 593 lines of Elamite were the first to be studied, and it 
was immediately apparent that this was a somewhat more 
complicated script than Old Persian, with 123 different signs. 
It was bound to be a syllabary, though it did have a few 
logographs for common words, such as king and land. 
○
○
By comparing proper names in the Old Persian captions to 
parallel portions of the Elamite captions, the sound values of 
many of these signs could be worked out, and most of them 
were known by 1855.
○
○
Unfortunately, no sooner were these values tried out on the rest 
of the Elamite text than it became apparent that the language 
resembled no other, living or dead. Elamite is what linguists 
call an isolate—a language with no known relatives. This has 
greatly hindered all additional work on this writing system.
• 
Although we can’t unlock the Elamite language, the Elamite 
decipherment was still important. It revealed that the origin of 
Elamite cuneiform was the same Sumerian cuneiform that gave rise 
to Akkadian, Assyrian, and Babylonian, with many signs of shared 
shape and meaning.
Deciphering Babylonian
• 
The 112 lines of Babylonian were immediately more interesting than 
the Elamite inscription in that they could be related to numerous 
tablets that had made their way from Babylon to European museums 
in the preceding decades. The Babylonian script was much more 
complicated than either Old Persian or Elamite, with more than 600 
signs. Such numbers indicate that Babylonian was a mixed script, 
with both logographs and phonetic syllables.
• 
As with the Elamite script, the sound values of Babylonian began 
to be worked out by comparing the proper names of the Old Persian 

131
captions to parallel portions of the Babylonian captions. However, 
given the complexity of the script and the radically different 
sounds involved, this was a fairly tricky process. Numerous other 
biscripts (from Persepolis, Naqsh-e Rostam, and excavations in 
Mesopotamia) were all needed to test equivalences. 
• 
Luckily, it quickly became apparent that Babylonian was a Semitic 
language, related to Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Phoenician, 
among others. 
○
○
This connection became clear when the new syllables (with 
unique phonetic signs, uncommon in most scripts) started 
consistently spelling known Semitic roots and words, such as 
’il (“god”), mlk (“king”), and so forth. 
○
○
This discovery meant that peculiarities of sound and meaning 
could begin to be explained by comparison with other Semitic 
languages; the Babylonian inscriptions immediately became 
many times more intelligible than Elamite.
• 
In addition to Rawlinson, two other scholars began working on this 
problem: Edward Hincks (1792–1866) and Jules Oppert (1825–
1905). Hincks is now credited with deducing much of the structure 
of this complex logosyllabic script, though his insights certainly 
rested on Rawlinson’s careful copies of the inscriptions at Behistun.
Comparing Old Persian and Babylonian
• 
A comparison of Darius’s doorway inscription from Persepolis 
with its Babylonian equivalent reveals how different the two 
scripts look, despite the fact that they’re both cuneiform. Both texts 
basically say the same thing: “Darius, the great king, king of kings, 
king of countries, son of Hystaspes, the Achaemenian, who built 
this palace.”
• 
The Old Persian text looks longer because every word had to be 
spelled out syllabically, whereas in the Babylonian text, many 
words could be spelled out with logograms. For instance, note 
the repetition of the group xa-sha-a-ya-tha-i-ya to spell king, 

132
Lecture 16: What Does Cuneiform Say?
compared to the repeating logograph meaning the same thing in the 
Babylonian inscription.
• 
The opening signs of each inscription spell Darius’s name, which 
was da-a-ra-ya-va-u-sha in Old Persian and da-ri-ia-a-mush  
in Babylonian. 
○
○
Compare the cuneiform signs for da and a here. Apart from 
both being wedge shaped, they look nothing alike. The reason 
for the dissimilarity is that these two writing systems are not 
historically related. 
○
○
In contrast, if we were comparing Elamite and Babylonian, we 
would find several signs of similar shape and meaning, because 
both of these scripts trace their origins to early Akkadian, 
which was borrowed from Sumerian.
Tracing Cuneiform Borrowing
• 
If we trace Babylonian backward about 100 years from these 
inscriptions, we note an interesting feature of these cuneiform 
scripts: semantic signs.
○
○
According to the Bible, Nebuchadnezzar II captured and 
destroyed Jerusalem in 586 B.C. and deported many 
Israelites. But according to a brick inscription dedicated by 
Nebuchadnezzar during an expansion of Babylon’s temples, he 
was nonetheless a deeply pious man and a great patron of his 
god Marduk. 
○
○
The star-shaped sign at the beginning of this brick inscription 
comes from the Sumerian script, where it has the semantic 
value DINGIR (meaning both “god” and “sky”), as well as the 
phonetic value an. In Akkadian, the sign continued to be used 
as a semantic sign for “god” but could also be read ’il, from the 
Semitic root that also meant “god.” 
○
○
In this brick text, the star-shaped sign qualifies the following 
sign, NABU, as the name of a Babylonian god. This sign is the 

133
first part of Nebuchadnezzar’s name, which runs for five more 
blocks, halting at the Sumerian logograph LUGAL (“king”). 
○
○
The last four signs are also Sumerian but carry the Semitic 
reading Bab’ili. The final sign is a semantic one indicating that 
this is a place, namely, the city of Babylon. Together, the first 
line reads “Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.”
• 
If we go back 15 more centuries, to the Sumerian origins of this 
script, we note the visual complexity of the earlier cuneiform and 
the arrangement of the signs in rectangular boxes, rather than the 
linear arrangement we’ve seen among later scripts. 
Earliest Mesopotamian Writing
• 
At the end of the 4th millennium B.C., Mesopotamian writing was 
highly pictorial, just like the earliest attested phases of Chinese 
characters and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Also like Chinese—but 
unlike 
Egyptian—
Mesopotamian writing 
lost this highly pictorial 
quality and became 
more rectilinear and 
visually 
simplified 
through time.
• 
The 
first 
step 
in 
this 
process 
was 
probably the transfer 
of the script from a 
perishable 
medium, 
such as ink on papyrus, 
to the comparatively 
more durable but also 
clumsier medium of 
wax or clay. As with 
Chinese, a painted format would seem to be responsible for the 
flowing, curvilinear forms of these early pictographs, whereas the

and Akkad, has built her temple.”

134
Lecture 16: What Does Cuneiform Say?
transfer to clay or wax would have promoted more angular forms 
and the technique of impression rather than incision.
• 
Scholars are divided about what precisely led to the next step, 
a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation of signs. Whatever the 
reason, the reorientation undoubtedly assisted the process of 
schematization as scribes began to lose track of the original 
pictorial motivation of signs. 
• 
The third step involved making the sign by impressing reeds in a 
wax or clay surface rather than dragging the stylus through wet clay 
to make an incision. At this stage, major simplifications of the signs 
often took place, and these simplifications each developed in their 
own ways in various descendant scripts.
Influence of Cuneiform Literature
• 
The great library of Ashurbanipal (r. 669–631 B.C.) was discovered 
by Austen Henry Layard in 1849. This king and his successors 
had combed all of Asia to collect and copy a library of more than 
10,000 cuneiform tablets in their palace at Nineveh. The tablets 
recorded myths, legends, scientific and geographical information, 
even the world’s first map. The library also contained The Epic of 
Gilgamesh, a widely known story that had a resounding influence 
on later literature, including the Hebrew Bible.
• 
The influence of early cuneiform authors is even more widely felt 
in religious ordinances and law. Thus, the 3,000-year-old law code 
of Hammurabi is immediately recognizable as the ultimate source 
of several biblical laws, as well as the inspiration for the secular 
legislation of later eras. 
• 
Ancient Mesopotamian scribes have bequeathed us a wide and 
varied literature. The contents of these cuneiform scripts are 
revelatory in many ways. Not only are they sometimes eerily 
modern—leading us to recognize our common humanity with 
individuals who lived in a very different time and place—but 

135
they also shine a light on the origins of practices and beliefs that 
continue to the present day.

Lecture 17: Mycenaean Linear B—An Aegean Syllabary
Mycenaean Linear B—An Aegean Syllabary
Lecture 17
I
n 1628 B.C., the Aegean island of Santoríni exploded in a cataclysmic 
volcanic eruption that spawned a massive tsunami. Ships and coastal 
settlements throughout the Aegean Sea were devastated, including 
the city of Knossos on the nearby island of Crete, once the center of a 
powerful trading empire. After the catastrophe in 1628, the wealthy citizens 
of Knossos (known as Minoans) were apparently weakened and were 
eventually overwhelmed by the Mycenaeans. These new arrivals adopted 
and adapted the Minoan writing system—an undeciphered script called 
Linear A—developing the complex script called Linear B. In this lecture, 
we’ll discuss the discovery, decipherment, and contents of this intriguing 
ancient writing system.
Linear B and the Five Pillars
• 
The story of Cretan writing begins with the excavations of Sir 
Arthur Evans (1851–1941) at Knossos in 1900. For five years, he 
labored to uncover what he called the Palace of Minos, the seat of a 
Late Bronze Age kingdom. Evans unearthed the remains of at least 
three different writing systems spanning about 1,000 years, from 
2200–1200 B.C. 
• 
The earliest of these systems (2200–1700 B.C.) is an undeciphered 
hieroglyphic script. The second (1800–1450 B.C.) was a 
logosyllabic script named Linear Script A by Evans. This also 
remains undeciphered, although some scholars have suggested that 
Linear A may record a Semitic script allied with Phoenician or, 
perhaps, a language related to Lycian. The third script (1450–1200 
B.C.) was named Linear Script B by Evans and is the only one of 
the three that has been deciphered.
• 
Linear B has about 210 signs in total; it is a syllabary with many 
semantic signs. 

137
○
○
We now know that at least 87 of its signs are phonetic syllables, 
giving either the five pure vowels (a, e, i, o, u) or consonant-
vowel combinations (pa, pe, pi, and so on). The syllabary 
accounts for more than 90 percent of all the sign occurrences 
in the corpus. 
○
○
In addition to the syllables, there are 4 numerical signs, 1 
word divider, and about 125 semantic signs. The role of these 
semantic signs is to reduce the ambiguity of phonetic spellings. 
• 
There is a fairly ample corpus of Linear B texts, totaling about 
6,000 tablets of various lengths.
• 
The language of Linear B is well known, though it took Michael 
Ventris’s decipherment to reveal what it was: an archaic stage of 
Greek. It can be reconstructed by careful comparison of the many 
ancient and modern Greek dialects, as well as our understanding of 
the Indo-European family of languages, of which Greek is a member. 
• 
Thanks largely to Homer, the cultural context of the Bronze Age 
Mycenaeans is fairly well known, including the names of people 
and places on Crete. Both Homer and Herodotus gave us place 
names that were critical to the decipherment of Linear B.
• 
The one great missing piece in Linear B has been a bilingual. Despite 
Ventris’s eventual decipherment, the lack of a Linear B biscript is 
still keenly felt. There remains a fair degree of uncertainty about 
many phonetic and semantic signs, which has impeded scholars 
in moving beyond the obvious relationship between Linear B and 
Linear A to decipher the earlier script.
Evans’s Attempt at Decipherment
• 
Evans first established the left-to-right reading order of Linear B. 
He also identified the word divider, which helped him to recognize 
that the pictorially derived semantic signs and the number signs 
appeared at the ends of words. He fairly quickly worked out the 

138
Lecture 17: Mycenaean Linear B—An Aegean Syllabary
four numerical signs and was able to show that two particular signs 
probably spelled a word meaning “total.”
• 
Another of Evans’s breakthroughs was the identification of many 
of the semantic signs in Linear B. These were pictorial in origin, of 
course, so the images are fairly transparent. One fragmentary tablet 
from Pylos depicts six horses, some with manes and some without. 
It seemed reasonable to Evans to conclude that different kinds of 
horses were being counted on this tablet. Several of the horses were 
also qualified with phonetic signs. 
○
○
Evans’s interest in early Mediterranean scripts led him to 
recognize that the syllabic signs were from the Cypriotic 
syllabary. Cypriotic is related to Linear A and Linear B, though 
it was invented much later (800–250 B.C.). It has 54 signs, and 
it has several bilinguals with both Phoenician and the Greek 
alphabet. For this reason, it was easily deciphered, in 1871, and 
was clearly used to write a dialect of ancient Greek. 
○
○
Cypriotic was also in use at the same time as the Greek 
alphabet, though it apparently had a longer history, as 
numerous shared signs between Linear B and Linear A suggest. 
It now seems clear that there was some historical connection 
among these three scripts, although the exact nature of that 
connection will have to await the decipherment of Linear A and 
more archaeological discoveries.
○
○
Evans saw that if he assumed that the two signs in front of the 
horse on the Pylos tablet had the same values as their lookalike 
signs in Cypriotic, they could be read po-lo, and pōlō was an 
early Greek word meaning “foal”! Had Evans followed this 
lead, he could well have deciphered Linear B, but he did not 
believe that Linear B was written in Greek. 
The Work of Alice Kober (1907–1950)
• 
The American archaeologist Alice Kober made significant 
contributions to Linear B studies in the mid- to late 1940s. She 
noticed several groups of frequently repeated words from the Cretan 

139
tablets whose contexts suggested that they were place names, such 
as Knossos. She also noticed that these words turned up in various 
forms with systematic variation in their final signs. She interpreted 
these as case endings. 
• 
Kober didn’t commit to these (or any) specific meanings, but if she 
was right, then the case endings should be shared, which would 
enable inferences to be made about shared consonants or vowels 
between different signs. She constructed a tentative “grid” of signs 
that probably shared a vowel of the case suffix, along with others 
that probably shared the final consonant of one of the place names. 
• 
Kober also noticed that the spellings of the common word for 
“total” varied depending on whether male or female objects were 
being counted. This suggested gender marking typical of Indo-
European languages, such as Greek.
The Work of Michael Ventris
• 
Michael Ventris justly receives credit for demonstrating that Linear 
B recorded an early version of Greek, although his work rests on 
the foundations provided by Kober. He was able to extend Kober’s 
grid, eventually drawing many of the syllabic signs into an intricate 
web of signs sharing consonants or vowels. 
• 
Ventris noticed that there were five signs that appeared almost 
exclusively at the beginning of words in Linear B, and he 
reasonably assumed these to be the vowels a, e, i, o, and u. In a 
syllabic script, such as Linear B, the vowels in the middle and at 
the end of words are supplied by consonant-vowel signs, such as 
po and lo, but vowels at the beginning of words had to be written 
with vowel-only signs, such as o. This provided yet another script-
internal check on decipherment.
• 
Because no bilingual was available, Ventris focused his efforts 
on the five Cretan place names identified by Kober. He noticed 
that three of them ended with the same sign, while two others 
shared a different final sign. But, on the basis of the declensions, 

140
Lecture 17: Mycenaean Linear B—An Aegean Syllabary
both of these signs had to share the same 
vowel. Ventris suspected that the vowel 
was probably -o, given sign similarities  
with Cypriotic. 
○
○
The three signs making up the second 
place name also shared this vowel. In 
other words, all three signs provided 
consonant -o sounds. This already 
suggested that it might provide the 
word Knossos, perhaps just ko-no-so, 
with the final -s unwritten. 
○
○
Ventris also noted that the first sign of 
the first word was one of his vowel-
only signs, and this sign shared the 
same vowel as the first sign of the 
fourth word. The sign looked exactly 
like Cypriotic pa. If it shared the vowel 
of the pure-vowel sign that began the 
first word, then that sign should be a. 
○
○
This suggested that the first word 
might be a-mi-ni-so for Amnisos  
and the fourth word might be pa-i-to 
for Phaistos.
• 
Ventris was encouraged by the intersection of 
the internally derived grid, the place names, and the Cypriotic values. 
He tested his hypotheses in other contexts, found that they made 
sense, and published his results in July of 1952. The following year, 
the archaeologist Carl Blegen announced his discovery at Pylos of a 
tablet that provided several spellings further verifying Ventris’s work.
Conclusions on Linear B
• 
Why would a script for Greek be so phonetically imprecise? The 
script was borrowed from speakers of an earlier Aegean language, 
which probably explains why it wasn’t well adapted to Greek 
Kober had noticed 
several groups of 
frequently repeated 
words that might 
be place names;

efforts, focused on

141
sounds. If we also factor in the resistance to change that all scripts 
share, as well as the relatively short time span in which Linear B was 
used, we can understand that there simply wasn’t time for Linear B 
to develop more of the phonetic frills of the Greek language.
• 
The Greek language was represented by at least three different 
scripts in antiquity. 
○
○
From 1450 to 1200 B.C., it was written in Linear B, which 
then vanished during the Greek dark ages. Four hundred 
years later, a related syllabic script reemerged on Cyprus, 
while still other speakers of Greek adopted and adapted the  
Phoenician alphabet. 
○
○
Eventually, that Greek alphabet overwhelmed the Cypriotic 
syllabary. This is one of the many reasons that scholars assert 
that writing and language are not isomorphic. Any language 
can be served by multiple writing systems, and a single writing 
system, such as the Roman alphabet, can be used to write many 
unrelated languages.
• 
The decipherment of Linear B also punctured myths about ancient 
Aegean civilization. Before the writings could be read, scholars 
predicted they would discuss mythical topics, such as minotaurs 
and labyrinths; perhaps they even contained the earliest drafts of 
the works of Homer. Instead, the texts are focused on accounting: 
shipments of sheep and payments to tradesmen.
• 
Although the contents of Linear B texts are fairly boring, they still 
speak volumes about what was considered important in the ancient 
Aegean world. Following our theme of writing and civilization, 
this shows us once again just how adaptable writing is. This was 
Europe’s earliest writing system, and it’s intriguing to observe that 
our modern cultural fixation with property ownership, labor, and 
identity is apparently nothing new. Europeans have been paying 
taxes and asking for receipts for the last 3,500 years.

Lecture 18: Mayan Glyphs—A New World Logosyllabary
Mayan Glyphs—A New World Logosyllabary
Lecture 18
Y
uri Knorosov was a Ukrainian-born, Soviet-educated linguist. 
Before World War II, he had studied Egyptology at Moscow State 
University. After the war, he also studied Chinese and Japanese 
before turning to Mayan hieroglyphs. Western scholars at the time, 
particularly the English anthropologist Sir J. Eric S. Thompson, believed that 
Mayan hieroglyphs were ideographic, but Knorosov’s isolation in the Soviet 
Union and his lack of contact with other Mayanists protected him from the 
ideographic fallacy. In this lecture, we’ll look at Mayan writing from the 
perspective of the five pillars of decipherment and follow the methodology 
of Knorosov that allowed him to overturn the mistaken ideas of the West.
Reception of Knorosov’s Decipherment
• 
Yuri Knorosov began his decipherment of Mayan hieroglyphic 
writing around the same time that Michael Ventris revealed his 
discovery that Linear B inscriptions recorded ancient Greek. 
Working in Leningrad, Knorosov faced obstacles not encountered 
by his Western contemporaries. He was effectively cut off from 
the American and European schools that had long served as the 
traditional centers of Maya studies. Interestingly, Knorosov’s 
isolation behind the Iron Curtain would both help and hinder  
his decipherment.
• 
Adequate dictionaries and grammars of Mayan languages were 
scarce in the 1950s, and several key sources, as well as records of 
Mayan inscriptions, were unavailable in Russia. 
○
○
For these reasons, Knorosov restricted himself in his early 
work to the Yucatec Mayan language, spoken in the northern 
Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico and northern Belize and well 
documented since the colonial era.
○
○
Knorosov also restricted his decipherment to the three surviving 
Maya codices, screenfold books of the 13th–15th centuries, that 

145
had made their way into European collections in Madrid, Paris, 
and Dresden during the 16th century. 
• 
Knorosov’s decipherment had to overcome shortfalls in two of 
our pillars: language and corpus. In the end, his decipherment was 
somewhat limited and contained several errors. But other scholars 
would apply Knorosov’s methods to earlier stone inscriptions and 
trace the development of Mayan writing over almost 2,000 years.
• 
Knorosov’s findings, published in 1952, were not well received 
by Western scholars. Dr. Gordon Ekholm, associate director of 
anthropology at the Museum of Natural History, responded to the 
news of Knorosov’s decipherment by saying, “Mayan hieroglyphics 
is a form of picture writing, each symbol of which is believed 
to represent an entire phrase or idea rather than a single letter or 
word.” It took more than a decade for Knorosov’s views to begin to 
be accepted in the West. 
The Five Pillars and Mayan Writing
• 
The strength of our current decipherment of Mayan writing, which 
can now be counted among the most successful and complete of all 
decipherments, is directly owed to the solid foundation provided by 
the five pillars of decipherment.
• 
First, the type of script is known and was quickly divined by 
Knorosov. Mayan writing uses more than 500 signs, strongly 
suggesting a mixed script, probably a syllabary with logographs 
and/or semantic signs. 
○
○
We now know that Mayan writing was in use from about 400 
B.C. to A.D. 1600. Coupled with the large area over which 
Mayan writing was used, including the modern countries of 
Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras, it’s easy to guess 
that the system must have changed over time and that it 
probably involved a certain degree of regional variation. 

146
Lecture 18: Mayan Glyphs—A New World Logosyllabary
○
○
At present count, scholars have cataloged more than 2,000 
different Mayan signs. But no more than 500 or so were in use 
at any given time; thus, Knorosov was right to use that figure.
○
○
About 100 of these signs are phonetic syllables, either giving 
the five pure vowels (a, e, i, o, u) only or consonant-vowel 
combinations (such as ka, ke, ki, and so on). These signs 
are used to spell out Mayan words or to provide phonetic 
complements, derivations, or inflections for Mayan logograms. 
○
○
In addition to the syllabic signs, there are about 400 logograms. 
Intriguingly, Mayan writing does not include semantic signs. 
Based on current evidence, there is no parallel in New World 
writing systems for the kinds of semantic signs seen in Old 
World scripts.
• 
Second, there is a large corpus of Mayan texts. Thousands of 
inscriptions are known in a diversity of media, including books; 
murals; ceramics; monumental inscriptions; and scores of 
portable inscriptions in stone, shell, and bone. The subject matter 
of Mayan inscriptions is equally varied, with such genres as 
folktales, mythology, religious ritual, and political history. Several  
programs of publication ensure the rapid dissemination of most 
new discoveries.
• 
Third, the language of Mayan hieroglyphic writing is now well 
known, and even before Knorosov, it should have been obvious 
that it was an early form of Mayan, given that Mayan languages 
continue to be spoken in and around the ancient cities where the 
hieroglyphs were carved. Although half a dozen of these languages 
have become extinct in the modern era and still others are 
endangered, there were once at least 37 distinct Mayan languages 
spoken in this area. 
○
○
The comparison of these 37 Mayan languages has allowed 
linguists to work out much of the Mayan family tree and a 
fairly detailed reconstruction of Proto-Mayan, the ancestor of 

147
the whole family, probably last spoken thousands of years ago 
in the Cuchumatanes mountain range of western Guatemala. 
○
○
Recall that the Egyptian language was first recorded more than 
5,000 years ago, and Coptic is its only surviving descendant. By 
contrast, we are much closer in time to the beginning of Mayan 
writing (currently placed no more than 2,500 years ago), and 
there are 37 related languages, including 8 languages that are 
very closely related, at least 2 of which are direct descendants. 
Thus, the linguistic decipherment of Mayan writing is on a 
much more solid footing than Egyptian.
• 
Fourth, thanks largely to the efforts of early Franciscan missionaries, 
the cultural context of the Maya was reasonably well known even 
in Knorosov’s day, including the names of several historical figures, 
gods, and places. 
○
○
Even more important was a list of the names of the Maya 
days and months in their ancient calendar, which recur with 
remarkable frequency in nearly all of the inscriptions. 
○
○
There is also a certain amount of cultural continuity among 
the numerous groups of speakers of Mayan languages today, 
meaning that ethnographic and linguistic fieldwork continues 
to yield new insights into earlier Maya culture.
• 
Finally, Mayan decipherment has been blessed with a number of 
useful biscripts. By far the most important of these come from 
Diego de Landa’s Relacíon de las cosas de Yucatán, or “Account 
of the Things of Yucatán.” Written in the mid-16th century but 
lost until the late 19th century, this work provided an invaluable 
survey of Maya culture and history, including many details of  
cultural context.
○
○
In his book, Landa attempted to relate 27 Mayan signs to 
the Spanish alphabet—clearly working from the incorrect 
assumption that Mayan writing was an alphabet. Any effort 
to apply this alphabet straightforwardly to ancient Mayan 
inscriptions is doomed to failure, but it was still an honest 

148
Lecture 18: Mayan Glyphs—A New World Logosyllabary
attempt to elicit the workings of Mayan hieroglyphs from a 
knowledgeable informant.
○
○
In addition to the more famous “alphabet,” Landa also included 
glyphs for the 18 named months of the Maya calendar. These 
are not only glossed by Landa with their names in Yucatec 
Mayan, but they are composed of 53 individual signs (a 
combination of syllables and logograms) whose values we 
comprehend today and can make sense of in these contexts. 
The 20 named days of the Maya calendar are also given in 
glyphic and alphabetic form. 
○
○
Finally, Landa provided two isolated words written glyphically 
(noose and water) and the glyphic sentence I don’t want to.
Knorosov’s Approach
• 
Knorosov began his decipherment by looking at the 27 signs given 
alphabetic values in Landa’s manuscript. He noticed that 3 signs 
were associated with the letter A, 2 with the letter B, 2 with L, and 
so on. Knorosov knew that allographs (signs of different shape 
with the same value) were a common feature of mixed logosyllabic 
scripts with hundreds of signs, but they were not typical of 
alphabets. Knorosov also knew from his study of the Mayan books 
that there were hundreds of signs in total, which also suggested that 
this was a mixed script of phonetic and word signs.
• 
Knorosov further noticed that most of the signs in Landa’s list 
were associated with single letters, such as the signs for A and 
B, but some of the signs were associated with consonant-vowel 
combinations, including the signs ca, cu, ku, and ti. Knorosov 
believed that all of these signs might actually be syllables, even the 
ones glossed simply B, L, and so forth.
• 
Knorosov 
cemented 
this 
observation 
by 
noting 
Landa’s 
own description of how he had elicited the alphabet from a 
knowledgeable Maya scribe. 

149
○
○
Landa makes it plain that he asked the scribe to spell out the 
Mayan words for “noose” and “water” by spelling out the 
words using Spanish letter names. In other words, instead of 
asking the scribe to write the word for “noose” (Mayan: le’), 
Landa asked for the letters using their Spanish names. 
○
○
Going back to Landa’s “alphabet,” Knorosov recognized that 
it must have been elicited in the same way. Today, we can 
explain all the signs in Landa’s various biscripts, in light of 
both Knorosov’s decipherment and his recognition of Landa’s 
elicitation process. 
• 
Knorosov realized that he needed to treat his own proposed sign 
values as hypotheses and test them in other contexts. He had 
access only to late Mayan books in 
European collections, but fortunately, 
these were much closer to Landa’s 
time than any of the earlier stone 
inscriptions. 
Working 
with 
the 
Madrid Codex and the Dresden 
Codex, 
Knorosov 
deciphered 
glyph blocks for turkey, dog, and 
eleven and verified his findings in  
Yucatec dictionaries.
• 
Knorosov’s method was productive 
because it stripped away the poetic, 
metaphorical, 
and 
ideographic 
explanations that had dominated the 
study of Mayan writing before he 
came along, and because it could 
be constantly tested against new 
contexts. Either these tests would 
generate sensible readings in context 
or something was amiss and the values 
would have to be revisited as a result. 
The method was self-correcting.
Knorosov began his 
decipherment with a well-
known page of the Madrid 
Codex, in which a glyph 
block referring to turkey 
could be isolated.

• 
The power of Knorosov’s methodology is attested by the fact that 
of the 20 glyphic readings he presented in his 1952 paper, all but 
1 continues to be accepted more than 60 years later. But the story 
of Mayan decipherment is hardly over. Knorosov had focused 
exclusively on phonetic signs, and he had looked at only the last 
300 years of Mayan writing. Hundreds of undeciphered word signs 
and more than 1,700 years of earlier Mayan writing remained to  
be deciphered. 
allograph: Refers to the relationship between two or more graphically 
distinct signs that carry identical reading values. From a synchronic 
perspective, allographs are signs that are freely interchangeable. From a 
diachronic perspective, such signs are often the result of either sound change 
(where signs of different origin come to convey the same sound) or graphic 
divergence (where a sign takes on two different forms over time).

What Do the Mayan Glyphs Say?
Lecture 19
M
ayan writing seems uncannily similar to Egyptian hieroglyphs. 
Both of these writing systems are highly pictorial, both have 
phonetic signs and logographic signs, and both combine these 
signs in strikingly similar ways. But archaeologists have found no indication 
of contact between the Maya and the Egyptians, and their writing systems 
are actually only superficially similar; they have none of the shared sign 
shapes, sign values, and spelling practices that characterize related scripts. 
How, then, can we explain the strikingly similar structural features of these 
unrelated scripts? In this lecture, we’ll explore the structure of Mayan 
writing and look at a few of the many examples of ancient Mayan writing 
available to scholars.
The Maya and Our Understanding of Writing
• 
The appearance of pictorial signs of phonetic and logographic 
type in unrelated scripts, along with the principle of phonetic 
complementation in these scripts, has led scholars to believe that 
these must be universal features of writing. That is, they arose 
because their users came up with the same solution for how to best 
represent language in a graphic medium.
• 
Through the decipherment of Mayan writing, scholars have also 
learned that semantic signs are not a universal feature of writing. 
These signs serve to reduce ambiguity and are required only in 
scripts where phonetic spellings leave room for ambiguity.
○
○
None of the three Egyptian scripts recorded vowels, producing 
many ambiguous contexts in which the reader needed some 
guidance about which vowels to insert. There were several 
possible responses to this ambiguity, including the invention  
of signs for vowels, but the Egyptians innovated semantic 
signs instead.

152
Lecture 19: What Do the Mayan Glyphs Say?
○
○
It makes sense that some scripts would solve this problem in 
another way, increasing phonetic representation rather than 
inventing semantic signs. This is exactly what we see in the 
history of the alphabet, including the Greek innovation of 
vowel signs. And like the Greek alphabet, Mayan hieroglyphic 
writing is remarkably phonetic, capturing almost all of the 
important phonemic distinctions of the language.
The Structure of Mayan Writing
• 
In the wake of Knorosov’s decipherment, scholars have had 
remarkable success in deciphering the hundreds of logograms in 
Mayan writing. Part of the reason for this is that the same word 
could be written in several ways, and by paying close attention 
to these variations, scholars could discern how logograms and 
phonetic signs cooperated to spell different words in the system. 
• 
Consider the word bahlam, meaning “jaguar.” The most basic way 
to spell this word is with the logogram BAHLAM. It originated as 
a recognizable picture of a jaguar, but it isn’t a pictograph; rather, 
it’s a logogram that always cues the word bahlam.
• 
Mayan writing also has many syllabic signs, and a scribe could 
complement the BAHLAM logogram with a suffixed syllable ma, 
giving a phonetic clue that the word ended in -m. The presence or 
absence of redundant phonetic complements seems to have been 
based on the whim of the scribe. Because the BAHLAM sign never 
has any other reading, the presence of -ma can’t be motivated by 
the reduction of ambiguity. 
• 
Instead, it seems likely that the principle began to provide important 
information in the form of grammatical prefixes and suffixes. 
○
○
To use an English example, we can convert the verb bake 
into the agentive noun baker by adding the suffix -er. Once 
this kind of practice became commonplace in Mayan, 
complementation was also adopted for rare logograms as an 
aid to comprehension. Only afterwards would it have spread by 
analogy throughout the system.

153
○
○
Whatever the origin of this practice, it’s a remarkable boon to 
epigraphers. Because the ma syllable was provided in Landa’s 
16th-century list of Mayan signs, it was deciphered well before 
the “jaguar” sign was. Such spellings provided the first clue 
that bahlam was the value of the logogram.
• 
The final evidence for the bahlam value came from several contexts 
in which the scribes dispensed with the logogram altogether and 
simply wrote the word bahlam with the syllabic signs ba, la, and ma.
• 
You may have noted a discrepancy between the Mayan word for 
“jaguar,” reconstructed by historical linguists as bahlam, and the 
phonetic spelling of this word in Mayan hieroglyphs as ba-la-ma. 
Namely, the /h/ in the middle of the word isn’t written. 
○
○
In a writing system whose smallest phonetic building blocks 
were either vowels or consonant-vowel syllables, there was 
no way to record consonant clusters without oversupplying  
a vowel. 
○
○
As in Linear B, some important sounds, such as this internal 
/h/, are therefore consistently abbreviated in Mayan writing. 
Fortunately, we know enough about the 37 Mayan languages 
that we’re able to reconstruct such things even when they’re 
not recorded by the ancient writing system. 
Mayan Allographs
• 
Another set of spellings nicely illustrates the frequent allographs in 
Mayan writing, that is, formally different signs that freely substitute 
with one another. For example, the word pakal, meaning “shield,” 
can also be written in several ways. 
• 
The logogram PAKAL depicts a hand shield of a type that is well 
known from Maya art. It’s pictorial in origin, again, but it doesn’t 
simply mean “shield” in a vague way; it always represents the word 
pakal, so its function is as a logogram. Like the jaguar glyph, it 
can receive the redundant phonetic complement -la underscoring 
its final -l.

154
Lecture 19: What Do the Mayan Glyphs Say?
• 
In addition to illustrating the frequency of allographs in Mayan 
writing, the differences in three syllabic spellings of pakal also 
nicely illustrate the idea that the pictorial nature of Mayan signs 
gives no clue as to their functions in the script. Just as we saw 
with Egyptian hieroglyphs, pictography is merely a process of sign 
formation, not a kind of sign. 
The Contents of Mayan Writing
• 
Mayan writing is remarkably pervasive. It appears on both 
monumental and portable objects and in a great diversity of media, 
including paper, wood, stone, ceramics, textiles, shell, bone, and 
even human skin.
• 
This diversity of media suggests an equally diverse series of 
messages, and indeed, Mayan texts record the ownership of 
important objects, speak about personal ritual practices, recount 
humorous folktales and sacred mythology, and chronicle politically 
charged local and regional histories.
• 
An inscription found on the underside of a carved limestone lintel 
from the site of Yaxchilan in Chiapas, Mexico, represents the height 
of Maya sculptural achievement in the early 8th century. The carving 
depicts a highly personal scene of ritual activity.
○
○
The left figure is clearly a male, captured in midstride while he 
holds a burning spear. He is identified by the hieroglyphs above 
as the king Itzamnaaj Bahlam, who ruled Yaxchilan from A.D. 
681 to 742. The hieroglyphs explain that the king’s image is 
“in the act of penance with a fiery spear.”
○
○
The king’s wife, Lady K’abal Xook, kneels to the right and 
draws a thorn-studded rope through her tongue. Blood spatters 
her cheeks and falls into the basket of bloodletting implements 
and ritual books between them. The short text to the left 
identifies her and tells us that this is also “her image in the act 
of penance.”

155
○
○
Given 
the 
secrecy 
with which such rites 
were conducted, it’s 
doubtful we would 
ever have understood 
their importance had 
Mayan glyphs not 
been deciphered. 
• 
Another inscription is on 
a large, four-sided altar 
(Altar Q) from the site 
of 
Copan, 
Honduras. 
Each side depicts four 
individuals 
seated 
on 
their 
hieroglyphic 
names and titles, and the 
upper surface contains a 
historical text of 36 glyph-
blocks in length. Thanks 
to the decipherment of 
Mayan, we know that these 
individuals were sequent 
kings of a dynasty that ruled Copan for more than 350 years.
○
○
The west side of the monument depicts the dynastic founder, 
K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo’, just left of the center. He is shown 
as a foreigner, holding a burning torch and square shield and 
wearing a circular eye ornament that associates him with the 
great western metropolis of Teotihuacan in central Mexico. 
○
○
He was succeeded by his son, depicted at far left, and 14 
additional kings, culminating in the reign of Yax Pasaj Chan 
Yopaat, who is seated just right of center, as if in dialogue with 
his distant predecessor. 
○
○
Scholars were initially skeptical about the history related 
by this monument. However, archaeological excavations at 
Burnt offerings and the nourishing 
of the gods with human blood, as 
shown on the lintel from Yaxchilan, 
were sacred ritual activities and deeply 
personal sacraments.

discover the rest of them.
• 
Finally, we see a lengthy narrative scene from a Classic Maya vase. 
This object was excavated illicitly in the 1970s and sold on the 
international art market. 
○
○
The horizontal band of larger hieroglyphs just below the 
vessel’s rim tells us that this was the chocolate drinking cup 
owned or commissioned by a late-7th-century king of Naranjo, 
K’ahk’ Tiliw Chan Chahk. 
○
○
Also on the vase are two sequent narrative scenes, punctuated 
by hieroglyphic captions. These captions are actually attached 
to the mouths of the figures in these scenes and represent 
spoken words—like an ancient comic book! The vase depicts a 
humorous story of a rabbit who steals the clothing and jewelry 
of a rich merchant god.
• 
It’s impossible to exaggerate the importance of the highly varied 
contents of Mayan writing for our understanding of ancient Maya 
civilization. Although there are still important linguistic and cultural 
links between the modern Maya and their ancestors, most of what 
we know about ancient Maya sociopolitical organization, humor, 
religion, and elite culture comes to us from the decipherment of 
Mayan hieroglyphic writing. 
agentive noun: Denotes a person, animal, or thing that performs a specified 
action or activity (e.g., worker, baker). In English, agentive nouns can be 
derived from verbs by adding -er. In Mayan, this is done by adding aj- (e.g., 
ajtz’ihb, “writer, scribe”).
altar: An offering table used in ceremonies.

Aztec Hieroglyphs—A Recent Decipherment
Lecture 20
A
ztec writing owes very little to earlier writing systems in central 
Mexico. Its phonetic signs and logograms derive from Nahuatl, 
and the script appears to be an Aztec invention, designed to record 
the Nahuatl language. It seems to have been invented just 200 years before 
the arrival of the Spanish and continued to be used for more than 100 years 
after the conquest, disappearing in the mid-17th century. Despite its brief 
existence, Aztec hieroglyphic writing has much to teach us about the history 
and development of the Nahuatl language before the arrival of the Spanish, 
and its continued use during the first century of the colonial era sheds light 
on early interactions between Spaniards and Aztecs in New Spain. 
Aztec Writing and the Five Pillars
• 
Aztec writing is clearly of the logosyllabic type. Although the script 
is still not completely deciphered, scholars have counted more than 
400 logograms and around 50 phonetic signs, all of them either 
pure vowels or consonant-vowel combinations. These syllabic 
signs are used to spell out Nahuatl words or to provide phonetic 
complements to logograms. As with Mayan writing, the Aztec 
script does not appear to include semantic signs.
• 
The corpus of Aztec texts is not as large or diverse as scholars would 
like, but it has proven ample for the purposes of decipherment. 
Unfortunately, there are only a few dozen inscriptions in stone from 
the preconquest period, most of them rather short, and all of them 
providing dates in the Aztec calendar, place names, or the names of 
Aztec emperors. 
• 
The language recorded by Aztec hieroglyphic writing is well 
known. As the lingua franca of the Aztec Empire, Classical Nahuatl 
was amply recorded in the colonial era, and we have excellent 
dictionaries, grammars, and texts documenting this language during 
the last 500 years. About a dozen modern regional dialects of the 

159
Nahuatl language are still spoken today by more than 1 million 
modern Mexicans. 
○
○
Nahuatl is a member of the large Uto-Aztecan language family, 
which stretches from Utah to Nicaragua. Combined, these 
languages allow us to reconstruct Proto-Uto-Aztecan with 
some confidence and to trace the development of the Nahuatl 
language over thousands of years. 
○
○
Nahuatl has a written record longer than any other language 
in the New World apart from Mayan, stretching from the early 
14th century to the present day.
• 
The cultural context of Aztec hieroglyphic writing is well known 
and detailed in numerous books by early missionaries. Of particular 
importance here is the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún, 
who compiled an encyclopedic Nahuatl-Spanish work on Aztec 
culture with the assistance of literate informants. Now known as the 
Florentine Codex, this work details Aztec calendrics, mythology, 
religion, and history. 
• 
Finally, Aztec writing provides dozens of biscripts. Most Aztec 
texts come from the first 100 years of the Spanish colonial era and 
continued to be produced during this period, recording genealogies, 
histories, maps, and legal documents. In most of these documents, 
alphabetic glosses appear alongside the hieroglyphs, usually 
providing their reading in Nahuatl and occasionally providing an 
interpretative translation in Spanish or Latin. 
Aztec Documents
• 
The Codex Mendoza was commissioned by the viceroy of New Spain 
around 1540 as a record of the conquests of the Aztec emperors and the 
tribute owed to them. The pages were laid out with ample blank space 
between pictorial scenes and hieroglyphs to accommodate neat Roman 
alphabetic glosses indicating the reading of hieroglyphic elements. 
○
○
On one page, just left of center, an Aztec emperor is depicted 
seated on a reed throne and wearing a turquoise diadem. His 
name glyph floats behind his head, attached to the back of his

Lecture 20: Aztec Hieroglyphs—A Recent Decipherment
robe by a short tether. This glyph is a compound of two signs: 
a logogram reading TIS, “chalk,” and the phonetic sign xo. 
Together, these provide an abbreviated spelling for the name 
Tizoçicatzin, indicated in Roman letters on the emperor’s 
cloak. Today, we usually call this emperor Tizoc.
○
○
The left side of the page references six years by their Aztec 
hieroglyphs, enclosed in square cartouches. Below them, in 
Spanish, is the alphabetic gloss “numero de años. 6,” recording 
the number of years that Tizoc ruled (1481–1486).
○
○
Tizoc is depicted as speaking, and the hieroglyphs to the right 
record his speech as mitl chimalli (meaning “war”). He has 
declared war on the 14 city-states listed on the rest of the page, 
their hieroglyphic names all yoked to icons of burning and 
collapsing temples, indicating that they’ve been defeated.
• 
In other documents, the 
alphabetic glosses were 
clearly an afterthought, 
as 
revealed 
by 
the 
strange angles of the 
writing, worked in at 
some unknown time after 
the initial composition. 
A good example is the 
Matricula de Tributos, 
an early colonial register  
of tributes.

eight place names

man. This is an abbreviated spelling for Huehuetlan, a city in 
the Soconusco region of coastal Chiapas. Other place names 
are written with one or more logograms or with combinations 
of logograms and phonetic signs. 
○
○
These eight city-states in the Soconusco region owed tribute to 
the capital of the Aztec Empire on a biennial basis. At the top 
left and right corners of the page are the glyphs for the Aztec 
months Ochpaniztli and Tlacaxipehualiztli, indicating when 
the tribute was due. 
The Tyranny of the Gloss
• 
Ironically, the uniquely abundant biscripts for Aztec writing didn’t 
lead to early decipherment but to a long tradition of studying the 
Roman alphabetic glosses alone, without much attention paid to the 
system underlying Aztec writing.

Even the glyphs on preconquest stone monuments, which don’t 
include glosses, usually provide the same dates, rulers’ names, 
and place names attested in colonial documents. Thus, these 
glyphs were usually compared in toto, with little concern for 
their individual parts. 
○
○
As a result, a view of Aztec hieroglyphic writing as pictographic 
or ideographic has long dominated popular accounts.
• 
As an example, consider the Stone of Tizoc, discovered in the 
main square of Mexico City in the late 18th century. Around its 
circumference, the monument depicts the emperor Tizoc and 
several of his predecessors capturing the patron gods of 15 different 
ethnic groups. 
○
○
Tizoc is named with the same hieroglyph as in the Codex 
Mendoza. The hieroglyphs of the 15 conquered groups could be 
reconciled with similar place names in the tribute documents, 
all interpreted on the basis of their glosses.
○
○
But the colonial-era glosses aren’t always complete, as when 
the general label Xoconochco is used in the Matricula de

Tributos to refer to an entire region where eight distinct city-
states were located.
○
○
In the Codex Mendoza, the sixth conquest of Tizoc’s reign is 
identified in the alphabetic gloss as Toluca, a large region to 
the west of the Valley of Mexico. By contrast, the glyphs can 
be read as MATLA-TZIN and TOLO-TEPE, providing the 
abbreviated reference “the Matlatzincans of Tolucatepec.” This 
refers to the conquest of a specific ethnic group dwelling in the 
mountains of Toluca. Despite the customary abbreviation of 
several predictable suffixes, the hieroglyphs are more specific 
than the gloss.
○
○
Importing this information back to the Stone of Tizoc, we 
can see that the emperor grasps the forelock of a captive god 
labeled with the hieroglyphic MATLA. This is an even more 
abbreviated spelling of Matlatzinca, referring to the ethnic 
group whose patron god this was. It’s only by paying close 
attention to the details of the hieroglyphic spellings, rather than 
the glosses, that we can recover features that escaped the early 
colonial gloss-makers.
Decipherment of Aztec Writing
• 
Given the long concentration on glosses, it wasn’t until the 19th 
century that scholars first began to consider Aztec writing on its 
own merits. The most important figure in this period was Joseph 
Marius Alexis Aubin (1802–1891), an independently wealthy 
Americanist and a collector of ancient Mexican manuscripts. With 
firsthand access to many primary sources, Aubin set out in 1830 
to rigorously compare Aztec hieroglyphs to their glosses in dozens  
of documents.
• 
Aubin’s observations were published in 1849 in a study titled Notes 
on the Didactic Paintings and Figurative Writing of the Ancient 
Mexicans. Not only did he note the clear and consistent distinction 
between narrative pictography (“didactic paintings”) and Aztec 
hieroglyphs proper (“figurative writing”), but he also penetrated to 

163
the core of the writing system, recognizing that it contained both 
logograms and phonetic signs.
• 
Aubin’s most important discovery was the substitution of 
logographic and phonetic spellings of the same name. Thus, in the 
Codex Vergara, he was able to show that the Nahuatl name Itzcoatl, 
“Obsidian serpent,” was frequently written with the logograms ITZ 
(“obsidian”) and KOA (“snake”). 
○
○
Because the signs are pictorial in origin, it’s easy to see why 
many scholars regarded them as mere pictograms or ideograms, 
potentially readable in any language.
○
○
But Aubin showed that the “snake” part of the name was 
sometimes written with the phonetic signs ko and a instead, 
straightforwardly spelling out the word koa, “snake.” As he 
noted, only phoneticism can explain this—not ideography  
or symbolism. 
○
○
Aubin also recognized that the origins of the ko and a signs 
were acrophonic, stemming from the Nahuatl words komitl 
(“vase”) and atl (“water”). Aubin went on to demonstrate that 
all of the phonetic syllables he could identify also had sources 
in the Nahuatl language, strongly suggesting that either the 
Aztecs or another Nahuatl-speaking group must have invented 
this writing system.
• 
One principle that eluded Aubin was phonetic complementation. 
This wasn’t noted until 1888, when Zelia Maria Nuttall (1857–
1933) published a perceptive short article entitled “On the 
Complementary Signs of the Mexican Graphic System.” She had 
noted that certain Aztec signs redundantly repeated the initial 
or final sounds of logograms, providing a clue to their reading. 
In interpreting this feature of Aztec writing, Nuttall referenced 
Egyptian phonetic complements, perhaps the first instance of a 
comparative approach to the decipherment of a New World script.

164
Lecture 20: Aztec Hieroglyphs—A Recent Decipherment
• 
In 2008, the Spanish Mesoamericanist Alfonso Lacadena published 
two detailed studies of Aztec writing, following up on the insights 
of Aubin and Nuttall. He noted that Nuttall’s principle of phonetic 
complementation was the key to identifying which signs were 
logograms and which were phonetic syllables. Applying this 
principle to both preconquest and postconquest sources, Lacadena 
and other scholars have been able to systematize and extend  
Aubin’s decipherment.
• 
We have now deciphered at least 45 Aztec syllabic signs and at 
least 400 word signs, as well as abbreviational conventions eerily 
similar to those of Mycenaean Linear B. Given the impossibility 
of any historical connection between these two scripts, this 
provides another remarkable example of the universal features of 
logosyllabic writing systems.
abbreviation: A conventional incomplete spelling of a word (e.g., English 
Mr. for Mister). Abbreviations can seem like errors, but they’re usually 
systematic and codified. For instance, the Linear B, Mayan, and Aztec scripts 
routinely omit the spelling out of final consonants.

1.	 Given the profound structural similarities between Aztec and Mayan 
hieroglyphic writing, with their hundreds of logograms, phonetic 
syllables, and the principle of phonetic complementation, why do you 
suppose the Aztecs never wrote the lengthy texts that characterize 
earlier Mayan writing? 
2.	 Some scholars have supposed that Aztec writing is restricted to names 
and calendrics so that it could be “read in any language.” Is this position 
supported by what you’ve learned about Aztec writing? Why or why not?
3.	 What do you think about the preoccupation of the Aztec emperor Tizoc

Etruscan and Meroïtic—Undeciphered Scripts
Lecture 21
B
eginning with Champollion almost 200 years ago, epigraphers 
have had remarkable success in deciphering ancient scripts. Egypt, 
Mesopotamia, Crete, and Mexico have all given up their secrets. 
Scholars can now compare writing systems of all known types, around the 
world, and over more than 7,000 years of development. Universal features of 
writing systems, such as phonetic signs and phonetic complementation, have 
been discovered, as well as intriguing regional differences, such as the lack 
of semantic signs in the New World. But in this lecture, we turn to some of 
the failures of decipherment. Studying undeciphered scripts not only helps 
us better appreciate the limits of decipherment but, surprisingly, also sheds 
light on ancient civilizations.
Obstacles to Decipherment
• 
Despite decades of effort by many qualified epigraphers, dozens 
of scripts remain undeciphered. These include the Indus script of 
the Indus River valley of Pakistan, three early scripts of Crete, the 
Etruscan alphabet of northern Italy, the Meroïtic alphabet of the 
Sudan, and others. These systems remain undeciphered because 
they are lacking one or more of the five pillars, without which 
decipherment is always hindered if not impossible.
• 
None of the most well-known undeciphered scripts will be 
deciphered unless new information becomes available. Biscripts 
and underlying languages are needed for most of these scripts, and 
it’s quite possible that such material doesn’t exist. In those cases, 
the scripts may never be deciphered.
• 
The Etruscan and Meroïtic scripts represent two of the worst-case 
scenarios with regard to decipherment. 
○
○
The two are about evenly matched in terms of the five pillars. 
Each has an ample and varied corpus; the type of script is 
clear in both cases; we know a great deal about their cultural 

167
contexts; and both writing systems have biscripts. The starting 
conditions with respect to these four pillars are about as good 
as we could hope for.
○
○
Only the language pillar is wanting. The Etruscan and Meroïtic 
languages are both isolates, meaning that they have no known 
relatives or descendants, and they are both poorly recorded, 
meaning that there are no surviving dictionaries or grammars 
to help us interpret them. Language is the only thing holding 
up their decipherment—but that’s no small thing!
Etruscan Civilization
• 
The Etruscan civilization of northwest Italy arose in about 800 B.C., 
some 50 years before the traditional date of the founding of Rome 
in 753 B.C. The Etruscans were at their height in 500 B.C. Like 
many of their contemporaries in the Mediterranean, the Etruscans 
were seafarers and traders. 
• 
Many trade goods and opportunities came by way of merchant 
ships from Greek and Phoenician civilization. And it was by virtue 
of these same sea routes that the Etruscans first came into contact 
with the Greek alphabet, which they borrowed and adapted to serve 
their language. In turn, the early Romans were heavily influenced 
by the Etruscans, from whom they borrowed their alphabet.
• 
It’s easy to see—both from the shape and orientation of signs and 
from their sound values—that the Etruscans must have borrowed 
their alphabet from the Greeks rather than the Phoenicians. For 
one thing, the Etruscan alphabet includes the five cardinal signs for 
vowels, a Greek innovation, as well as such characteristic Greek 
signs as Φ and Χ. 
• 
The earliest Greek writing ran from right to left, and later Greek 
was sometimes written in boustrophedon, with alternating left-to-
right and right-to-left lines. Whenever the script ran from right to 
left, the letters would be rotated 180 degrees from what we think of 
as the normal orientation. This reading order left a remnant in the 

168
Lecture 21: Etruscan and Meroïtic—Undeciphered Scripts
typical orientation of Etruscan letters, which favored the right-to-
left order and orientation. 
• 
There were also several sound changes in adapting the Greek 
alphabet to the Etruscan language. Note that the Greek letter B was 
borrowed by Etruscan but not as the sound /b/, which apparently 
didn’t exist in the Etruscan language; rather, it was used for the 
sound /f/, for which there was no sign in Greek. These kinds of 
changes during script borrowing are common. 
• 
We know where the Etruscan alphabet came from (the Greek 
alphabet) and where it went (the Roman alphabet). As a result, we 
can read almost every word of Etruscan aloud with a fair degree of 
certainty. Unfortunately, we understand very little of it.
• 
Despite its early importance, 
Etruria 
was

300 B.C. Within the next 
300 years, the region had

metropolitan Roman culture,

and private sectors in favor  
of Latin.

or grammars. 
• 
Some picture biscripts are available, but they don’t add anything to 
our knowledge of the Etruscan language. They do, however, attest 
to the strong cultural influence of Greek mythology. Bronze mirrors 
buried with Etruscan women also show mythological scenes.
• 
The Etruscan language and writing system were eventually 
abandoned in favor of Latin and the Roman alphabet, and Etruscan 
culture was similarly absorbed by Roman imperial culture. But 
the Etruscans have left behind a rich legacy. The classical myths 
we know today have passed down to us via the Romans with a 
decidedly Etruscan flavor.
Meroïtic Civilization
• 
The Kushite or Meroïtic civilization was one of the most 
important early states of Sub-Saharan Africa. Its origins go back 
to the 3rd millennium B.C., but it entered written history (through 
references in Egyptian hieroglyphs) only in the 8th century B.C. 
In the late 8th century, Kushite kings conquered Egypt itself, 
founding its 25th dynasty. 
• 
The Nubian kings portrayed themselves as devout worshipers of 
Amun and restorers of the glory of Egypt after a series of disastrous 
civil wars. They ruled Egypt for almost 100 years but were pushed 
back by the Assyrians in the 7th century B.C. Returning to Kush, 
they built great pyramid fields modeled after those at Giza.
• 
In their home country, the Kushites began recording their history 
in Egyptian hieroglyphs, erecting stelae similar to those in Egypt 
and burying inscribed objects in their tombs. By about 300 B.C., 
however, they had innovated a writing system of their own: an 
abugida (a mixed script with alphabetic and syllabic characters).

170
Lecture 21: Etruscan and Meroïtic—Undeciphered Scripts
• 
The Kushites abandoned Egyptian hieroglyphs in favor of their 
new script, which they used to write their own language. They 
continued to do so for almost 750 years, until the mid-4th century 
A.D. More than 1,000 Meroïtic texts are known. Most of them are 
on stone, but there are also texts on ceramic sherds, papyrus, and 
wood. Formulaic funerary inscriptions constitute more than half of 
the known corpus, although there are also some lengthy royal texts 
on stelae.
• 
The Meroïtic script was abandoned only in the 4th century, as 
Kush disintegrated into three smaller kingdoms and converted to 
Christianity. It’s unclear precisely why Meroïtic was abandoned, 
but it may have had more to do with the slow demise of the Meroïtic 
language under pressure from Coptic Christian culture than with 
script death itself. 
The Meroïtic Script
• 
In the mid-19th century, the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius 
recognized that Meroïtic had only 23 signs (not including a 
common word divider) and that it had both a hieroglyphic and a 
cursive variant. On that basis, Lepsius argued that the script was 
most likely an alphabet, and until recently, most scholars concurred. 
But recent work suggests that it was a partial syllabary, technically 
known as an abugida. 
• 
The Meroïtic sound values used by most scholars today derive 
largely from the decipherment presented by Francis Llewellyn 
Griffith early in the 20th century. Griffith began by comparing 
hieroglyphic and cursive inscriptions to discover equivalencies. 
Close study allowed Griffith to equate all 23 hieroglyphic signs 
with their cursive equivalents.
• 
Griffith next turned to an important biscript, published earlier by 
Lepsius and recorded on the base of a sacred wooden boat. The 
texts contained two sets of royal names encircled in cartouches—
one set in Egyptian hieroglyphs, the other in Meroïtic hieroglyphs. 
The Egyptian cartouches had been known since the late 19th century 

171
to provide the names of the Kushitic king Netekamani and his  
queen, Amanitare.
○
○
By comparing the Meroïtic inscriptions, Griffith was able to 
propose the consonantal values M, N, T, K and R, as well as the 
vowel signs I and E. The similarity of some of these signs to 
their sources in the Egyptian script was immediately striking.
○
○
But other Meroïtic signs were quite different. Some resembled 
Egyptian signs whose values they didn’t share, and some 
seemed to be new creations. 
○
○
These discoveries remind us that it’s only after a successful 
decipherment on the basis of biscripts, bilinguals, or other 
constraints that we can appreciate which signs were borrowed 
and which were not. Formal comparisons never constitute 
independent evidence for decipherment. 
• 
Griffith went on to test and refine his sign values in other contexts, 
but because the underlying language remains unknown, scholars 
have largely had to satisfy themselves with reading the personal 
names of rulers in Meroïtic hieroglyphs, counting themselves lucky 
whenever those same names also appeared in Egyptian hieroglyphic 
inscriptions in Meroë.
• 
From time to time, a Greek connection of some kind has definitely 
been entertained, particularly by scholars uncomfortable with the 
idea of the independent invention of vowels by the Greeks and the 
Kushites. Certainly, the idea that the vowels of the Meroïtic abugida 
might owe something to the Greek alphabet cannot be entirely ruled 
out, but there is no positive evidence for it either, not in the form of 
the Meroïtic vowel signs or in the specifics of their syllabic usage.
• 
Today, scholars know only the rough meanings of about 26 words 
in Meroïtic, all of them derived from Egyptian/Meroïtic biscripts 
and contextual analysis of the inscriptions. They include such 
words as malo (“good”), at (“bread”), ato (“water”), mak (“god”), 

172
Lecture 21: Etruscan and Meroïtic—Undeciphered Scripts
and kandake (“queen”). Unfortunately, these words don’t resemble 
any known language of the region, either modern or ancient. 
• 
As with Etruscan, a picture of the Meroïtic speakers nonetheless 
emerges even from this poorly understood script. They were 
more Egyptian than the Egyptians and eventually developed their 
own writing system to record their histories, only abandoning it 
after waves of foreign invasion and the new social, political, and 
economic realities of Christianization. 
abugida (or alphasyllabary): A writing system composed of a mixture of 
consonantal signs and syllabic signs, such as Meroïtic and Devanagari. The

Lecture 22: Han'gŭl, Tengwar, and Other Featural Scripts
Han'gŭl, Tengwar, and Other Featural Scripts
Lecture 22
M
any scripts around the world have been consciously designed, 
usually by a single individual or a small group of people, over a 
short period of time, and with specific aims and intentions. What’s 
fascinating is that most of them contain unmistakable internal evidence of 
their artificial invention. The linguist Geoffrey Sampson coined the term 
featural script for these writing systems. Featural scripts are highly phonetic 
scripts—alphabets, abugidas, or syllabaries—in which sign shapes are not 
arbitrarily related to sound (as they are in what we might call “natural” 
writing systems) but, instead, encode the phonetic features of the sounds 
they represent. In this lecture, we’ll look at several featural scripts, including 
Korean Han'gŭl, shorthand, and fictional alphabets.
Characteristics of Featural Scripts
• 
Featural scripts include some national writing systems in daily 
use, such as Korean Han'gŭl and the Canadian Inuktitut syllabary; 
idealistic alphabets, such as Lodwick’s universal alphabet; several 
kinds of shorthand; and fictional alphabets designed for fantasy 
and science fiction, of which J.R.R. Tolkien’s are perhaps the most 
well-known.
• 
Despite their superficial differences and their different uses, all 
these writing systems betray their intentional design in everything 
from structural organization to paradigmatic relationships between 
sign form and pronunciation. These are precisely the features that 
natural scripts do not show, clearly indicating that most writing 
systems were not purposefully designed in this way.
• 
Both structural and morphological evidence sets featural scripts 
apart. Structurally, the arrangement of signs in featural scripts and 
the relationships between them aren’t arbitrary, as they are in most 
writing systems, but deeply purposeful. With regard to morphology, 
the outward form or appearance of signs isn’t pictorial, abstract, or 

175
arbitrary, as it is in many of the scripts we’ve seen so far, but deeply 
patterned, with formal connections between signs representing 
similar sounds.
• 
Many featural scripts are structurally organized into grids or charts 
based on articulatory phonetics, that is, the way sounds are made by 
the human mouth. For example, in a featural script, the signs for b 
(a voiced bilabial plosive) and p (a voiceless bilabial plosive) will 
be grouped together, and p will also be grouped with other voiceless 
plosives, such as t and k. This phonetic organization is anything  
but arbitrary.
• 
Featural scripts aren’t just structurally organized into groups of 
signs representing similar kinds of sounds; the signs themselves are 
designed to reveal these groupings. Formal features, such as sign 
shape, orientation, and the addition of diacritical marks, all reveal 
phonetic connections between signs. 
Lodwick’s Universal Alphabet
• 
Francis Lodwick (1619–1694) was a Dutch merchant living 
in London and an avid pioneer of spelling reform. Like many 
immigrants, he was disenchanted by the mismatch between English 
spelling and pronunciation. He first proposed several spelling 
reforms, but he soon learned that the inertia of writing has both 
traditional and practical dimensions that make reform difficult.
• 
Recognizing that simply repurposing the Latin alphabet made 
it hard to avoid the impression that his new spellings weren’t 
just errors, Lodwick decided to create a universal script. In his 
1686 paper introducing his new alphabet, Lodwick outlined his 
three aims: (1) to facilitate learning for children, (2) to facilitate 
the recording of other languages, and (3) to serve as a standard 
reference for the sounds of a language.
• 
Lodwick expressed one rule for his new writing system: “that 
no Character have more than one Sound, nor any one Sound be 
expressed by more than one Character.” This meant that such 

176
Lecture 22: Han'gŭl, Tengwar, and Other Featural Scripts
sounds as /f/ wouldn’t be represented with the letters f, ph, or -gh 
(as they are in English) but with only a single sign.
• 
Lodwick’s universal alphabet separated consonants and vowels. 
The consonants were the same size as Roman consonants, but the 
vowels were smaller, designed to appear above consonants, similar 
to accent marks. Lodwick also grouped sounds in columns, putting 
together the bilabial consonants (b, p, m), alveolar consonants (d, t, 
n), and so on. 
J.R.R. Tolkien’s Writing Systems
• 
J.R.R. Tolkien was a professional linguist and a specialist in the 
history of Germanic languages and literature, both alphabetic and 
runic. In The Hobbit, first published in 1937, Tolkien used Anglo-
Saxon runes as a kind of code for Modern English. Tolkien also 
invented several writing systems of his own, including the cursive 
script known as Tengwar or Tîw (meaning “letters”) and the angular 
characters designed for cutting into wood, stone, or metal known as 
Certar or Cirth (meaning “runes”). 
• 
Tolkien used the Tengwar script on his original cover for The Lord 
of the Rings, recording the ominous opening lines of the ring poem: 
“Ash nazg durbatulûk” (“One ring to rule them all”). He even gave 
his fictional scripts a fictional inventor, Rúmil.
• 
Both Tengwar and Certar are featural scripts. Characters 
representing sounds of similar place of articulation or manner 
of articulation have formal properties that reflect this. Tolkien 
provides charts and full descriptions of his writing systems in 
appendix E of The Lord of the Rings. In these charts, he makes it 
clear that his scripts aren’t organized only by place and manner 
of articulation but that the signs themselves formally signal their 
phonetic relationships to one another.
Korean Han'gŭl
• 
As you might remember from Lecture 5, the Koreans initially 
adopted the Chinese script, which they used to write Korean for 

177
more than 1,000 years. But in 1443, King Sejong (r. 1419–1450) 
produced a new featural alphabet that would eventually be called 
Han'gŭl, Korean for “great script.”
• 
The Han'gŭl alphabet has 24 signs: 14 consonants and 10 vowels. 
Han'gŭl signs don’t appear in simple linear sequence, as ours do; 
instead, they’re grouped into blocks representing whole syllables. 
This is a formal influence of Chinese characters. Until the 1980s, 
Korean was usually written from right to left in vertical columns, 
just as Chinese once was. Today, however, the majority of texts are 
written from left to right in horizontal lines.
• 
King Sejong was motivated to create Han'gŭl because Chinese 
characters were a complex and cumbersome way to write the 
Korean language, which is very different from Mandarin Chinese. 
The characters took a long time to master and were, therefore, 
always the domain of aristocrats, whereas Han'gŭl was designed  
for everyone.
• 
By the 19th century, Han'gŭl had been adopted as an official script. 
Today, Korean is still written in a mixed script that uses Chinese 
characters for borrowed Chinese vocabulary and Han'gŭl for native 
words. North Koreans write exclusively in Han'gŭl, and South 
Koreans are moving in the same direction. 
Shorthand and Featural Scripts of Canada
• 
Phonetic scripts developed for stenography in the 19th century 
included Pitman, Gregg, and Sweet shorthand—all of which were 
featural scripts. In 1840, James Evans, a missionary working in 
northeastern Canada, was inspired by Pitman shorthand to create a 
syllabary for the Ojibwe language. 
○
○
The core of the syllabary is nine consonantal symbols that 
could be rotated in four directions to signal different associated 
vowels. A diacritic (a superscript dot) could also be used to 
mark vowels as long. 

178
Lecture 22: Han'gŭl, Tengwar, and Other Featural Scripts
○
○
The script was featural in that all syllables with the same 
consonant shared the same basic shape, while all syllables with 
the same vowel shared the same orientation. But nothing unites 
consonants that are similar with respect to place or manner of 
articulation; thus, it’s not quite as featural as the other scripts 
we’ve seen.
• 
Evans later adapted his script to write Cree, and others adapted it 
for the Inuktitut language. This became one of the official scripts of 
the Inuit Cultural Institute of Canada in 1976, and it’s still used on a 
daily basis in the Canadian territory of Nunavut.
Darius the Great and Old Persian
• 
In Lecture 15, we studied the Behistun trilingual. Among its more 
remarkable boasts is Darius the Great’s claim that he designed 
the Achaemenid syllabary. Because the Achaemenid script first 
appeared during Darius’s reign, some scholars have believed this 
claim, but more recent scholarship is skeptical.
• 
The script seems mature, with none of the hesitations, 
inconsistencies, or errors one might expect of a new system. It may 
have existed for some time on perishable media, with the Behistun 
monument serving as its public debut. Still, scholars have wondered 
whether Darius commissioned his scribes to produce a nationalistic 
Achaemenid script, with the king taking credit.
• 
Despite the debate, no one has considered the Old Persian syllabary 
from the perspective of featural scripts. If Darius’s claim is true, 
then the Old Persian syllabary was invented by a single individual 
(or a small group), over a short period of time, and with a single 
purpose in mind. If it could be shown that the Old Persian syllabary 
also had hallmarks of other featural scripts, Darius’s claim might be 
at least partially validated.
○
○
We don’t know about the organizational principles of the Old 
Persian syllabary, because we don’t have a list of signs showing 
their order or arrangement, if any. But a close look at the signs 
themselves reveals no pattern linking the form of the signs to 

179
their sound values. Sign form seems to be completely arbitrary, 
and the script as a whole seems indistinguishable from other 
natural scripts. 
○
○
These facts seem to cast doubt on Darius’s claim. But then 
again, perhaps Old Persian was like the Cherokee syllabary 
invented by Chief Sequoyah in the early 19th century or the 
Bamum syllabary of Cameroon invented by King Njoya in 
1896, both of which were designed to seem natural.
Conclusions about Featural Scripts
• 
As we’ve seen, the objectives of those who developed phonetic 
scripts are broad. For spelling reformers, such as Lodwick, idealistic 
concerns predominated. For Tolkien, a secret code in which to keep 
his journals and in which his linguist’s mind could have free rein 
eventually gave way to world building in fiction. For King Sejong, 
there seems to have been a complex mix of idealistic, practical, and 
nationalistic concerns at work.
• 
What shines through in all these examples is the versatility of 
writing generally. And like ancient scripts, invented ones don’t 
seem to have been motivated only by their first documented uses. 
Rather, it’s their structural features that prove most enlightening. 
Featural scripts were designed to be featural scripts. Beyond that, 
a featural script can be applied to write any language, just as any 
other script can.
• 
Whatever the motives for their invention, the many featural scripts 
that have been used to record English serve as a useful reminder that 
language is not the same thing as writing. When we also remember 
that Old English was written in runes and that Modern English can 
be written in Braille, we’re less likely to equate our language with 
our writing system and perhaps more willing to entertain options 
for its improvement or alteration in the future.

alveolar: Refers to a sound made by touching the tip of the tongue to the 
alveolar ridge behind the upper teeth (e.g., t, d, and n).
Certar (also Cirth): J.R.R. Tolkien’s runic-inspired featural script.
featural script: A highly phonetic script in which sign organization and sign 
form are not arbitrary but, instead, encode phonetic features, such as place 
and manner of articulation, as in Korean Han'gŭl and Tolkien’s Tengwar and 
Certar. The term was coined by Geoffrey Sampson (1985).
Han'gŭl (also Hangul): The 15th-century featural alphabet developed for 
Korean by King Sejong.
manner of articulation: Refers to the way in which air pressure, 
vocal cords, and other features help to produce a sound (e.g., plosive,  
fricative, nasal).
place (or point) of articulation: Refers to the location in the mouth where 
a sound is made or the parts of the mouth responsible for a sound (e.g., 
bilabial, dental, alveolar, palatal, velar, glottal).
shorthand: A method of rapid writing by means of abbreviation and 
phonetic signs, especially for taking dictation. The most popular systems 
were designed by Isaac Pitman and John R. Gregg in the late 19th century; 
both are featural scripts.

    Questions to Consider

Lecture 23: Medium and Message
Medium and Message
Lecture 23
T
he Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan is known for his 
counterintuitive axiom “The medium is the message.” McLuhan’s 
idea was that a medium (or a context) affects society and civilization 
not only by the message (or content) it delivers but through its own 
characteristics and relationships. McLuhan argued that medium was an 
important focus of study in its own right and that a careful examination 
of media might allow us to detect the unanticipated consequences of new 
technologies we might miss by privileging content alone. Early civilizations 
definitely saw McLuhan’s interrelated and interdependent connection of 
medium and message as revealed in the terms we use for writing implements, 
the act of writing, and the media on which writing appears. 
Writing Implements, Writing, and Media
• 
The word pen comes from Old French penne, meaning a “quill 
pen.” In turn, the French word came from Classical Latin penna, 
which meant “feather.” The word pencil comes from Old French 
pincel, meaning “paintbrush.” Pen and pencil refer to different 
kinds of writing implements today, but their etymologies reflect the 
influx of continental scribal culture into England in the wake of the 
Norman Conquest, when writing was done with quills or brushes 
dipped in ink.
• 
In Lecture 4, we saw that the English word writing comes from Old 
English wrítan, meaning “to cut, inscribe.” Interestingly, the word 
book comes from Old English bōc, which primarily meant “beech 
tree.” Evidently, the first Germanic runes were cut into wood, or 
wrítan on bōc. Later, wrítan was extended from carving to inking, 
and bōc, from “beech,” to “writing tablet,” to “book.”
○
○
Similarly, the word codex comes from Late Latin cōdex 
(Classical Latin caudex), which meant “tree trunk.” Today, a 
codex refers to a manuscript made of a number of bound sheets 
of paper, parchment, or vellum. Usually, codices are stacked 

183
and bound at one edge, like a book, but sometimes they’re 
continuous and folded accordion-style. Codex technology was 
developed by the Romans from wooden writing tablets. 
○
○
At first, these tablets were singular objects, but they began to be 
laced together with sinew. By the 1st century A.D., this began to 
be done with parchment, vellum, or papyrus. With the change 
in technology, the word caudex changed its meaning from “tree 
trunk,” to “block of wood,” to “writing tablet,” and eventually, 
to a specific kind of manuscript book made of lighter sheets of 
treated animal hide, papyrus paper, or pulp paper.
• 
Like so many of our other terms for the written culture that entered 
England with the Norman Conquest, the word paper can be traced 
through French back to Classical Latin papyrus. The Latin word 
already referred to paper in the conventional sense, but Latin had 
itself borrowed the term from Greek (papyros), where it specifically 
referred to the papyrus plant and only secondarily to the writing 
material made from it.
○
○
The Greek word papyros clearly didn’t originate in Greek. In 
fact, Greek had two words for papyrus and its products, the 
other being byblos. Both of these seem to be early loanwords 
from Semitic, with the latter a clear reference to the Phoenician 
city of Byblos. 
○
○
This indicates that papyrus paper must have been disseminated 
into the Mediterranean by Phoenician traders, from whom the 
Greeks picked up both the product and the word.
○
○
Comparative linguistics shows us that papyros and byblos are 
actually the same word. Perhaps Greek borrowed this word at 
two different times, from two Phoenician dialects, or from two 
distinct Semitic languages. 
○
○
However the word byblos came into Greek, its meaning 
eventually expanded to signify “scroll” and “manuscript.” 
When the book was introduced to the Greek-speaking world, 

184
Lecture 23: Medium and Message
the diminutive biblion (literally “small scroll”) was coined to 
refer to this new item. From biblion come the English words 
bibliophile, bibliography, and bibliomania.
○
○
The plural of Greek biblion is biblia. Latin borrowed this 
Greek word to refer to the Greek books (plural) of the New 
Testament, from which we get our word Bible. Thus, the word 
Bible traces its origin to the word papyrus, which was itself 
one of the names of an ancient Phoenician city! 
Manufacturing Papyrus Paper
• 
Papyrus is a tall, aquatic sedge native to central Africa and the 
Nile valley. It once grew abundantly in Egypt and was eaten and 
used to make rope and reed boats. The process of manufacturing 
paper from papyrus is long and elaborate and must have originally 
involved a great deal of trial and error.
• 
After the mature papyrus plants were harvested, the core of the 
stalk was sliced into long, thin strips. After soaking in water, the 
papyrus strips were laid out in slightly overlapping fashion until the 
For more than 4,000 years, papyrus scrolls dominated the publishing industry; 
the demise of the scroll carries a lesson for us now, in the age of the e-book.

185
desired sheet length was reached. Then, a second set of strips was 
laid over the first at right angles. The double-layered paper was then 
placed between linen and either pounded or pressed to remove the 
water. Under pressure, the papyrus sap seeped out to bind the strips 
into a single sheet.
• 
After pressing, drying, and trimming, the papyrus sheets were 
destined for either scrolls or books. For thousands of years, 
individual sheets were stuck together to make long writing surfaces, 
which could then be rolled up into scrolls. In later times, individual 
papyrus sheets were simply stitched together to form a book. The 
earliest known paper made out of papyrus is at least 5,100 years old, 
dating to a time not much later than the earliest writing in Egypt.
• 
The Phoenicians began the international dissemination of Egyptian 
papyrus, but the Greeks were importing it by at least the 6th century 
B.C. After their founding of the Macedonian Ptolemaic dynasty 
in 304 B.C., the Greeks themselves were in control of paper, 
which they exported to the whole of the Mediterranean. This trade 
continued until the 12th century A.D.
The Origins of Paper
• 
The traditional story of the origin of paper credits Cai Lun, a eunuch 
at the imperial court of China in the early 2nd century A.D., who was 
supposed to have made the first paper from tree bark, hemp, cloth 
rags, and old fishing nets. However, archaeologists have discovered 
earlier evidence of paper at a few 2nd-century-B.C. sites in  
western China.
• 
Paper is derived from cotton, flax, wood, and other plant materials. 
These are soaked and sometimes heated, then shredded, macerated, 
and pounded into pulp before being collected on a finely woven 
screen and dried into sheets. The procedure is now automated, but 
paper has been made this way for more than 2,000 years.
• 
Chinese paper-making was quickly borrowed by Korea, Vietnam, 
and Japan, but it wasn’t until the 8th and 9th centuries A.D. that it 

186
Lecture 23: Medium and Message
finally made its way along the Silk Road to the Muslim world, 
eventually arriving in Moorish Spain in the 11th century. At that 
time, the paper mills of Granada first introduced Europe to this 
new and relatively inexpensive technology, signaling the end for 
imported papyrus.
Other Media for Writing
• 
There are other media for writing, equally important in their impact 
on the shape and content of early writing. As mentioned in Lecture 
5, it’s probably the case that the first Chinese writing was painted 
onto small bamboo slips that were threaded together to form an 
early kind of codex. Although the earliest surviving examples of 
these bamboo codices date to the 5th century B.C., there are several 
clues that this practice extended at least as early as the Shang 
period, or about 1400 B.C.
• 
Increasing angularization, stylization, and simplification of early 
pictorial graphs is often the result of a change of medium. 
○
○
As we noted in Lecture 3, the abundant papyrus of the Nile delta 
probably explains the pictorial origins of our own alphabet. As 
the preferred medium shifted to carving and, perhaps, also to 
wax tablets or clay, the pictorial script responded by becoming 
more rectilinear and simplified. The change of medium also 
led to changes in sign orientation and to experimentation with 
different directions of reading.
○
○
In a parallel fashion, early rune-carvers apparently cut runes 
into wood from the very beginning. This handily explains the 
pronounced angular forms of their Roman-derived letters and 
probably also motivates the rotation of some signs to make 
them more amenable to the new medium. 
○
○
In Lecture 16, we saw that the highly pictorial glyphs of 
ancient Sumerian writing also apparently gave way to angular 
cuneiform as the medium changed from some perishable 
substrate to coarser and less responsive clay. Here, too, 

187
scholars suspect that the 90-degree rotation of early cuneiform 
signs was related to this shift of medium.
• 
Whether on papyrus, bamboo, clay, stone, or wood, there’s 
clearly an important relationship between medium and message. 
It’s partially deterministic, of course; how could a medium not 
transform what passes through it? But it isn’t entirely so, and it 
isn’t one-way only, because the need to convey writing also led to 
developments and alterations in the technology of writing itself. 
The Technology of Writing
• 
Transformations in technologies of writing can usually be linked to 
social transformations, such as the emergence of printing at an early 
date in China, but its practical application only much later, in the 
West, where an alphabet of only 26 signs made printing practical 
at the same time that the growing prestige of vernacular languages 
created an audience. But perhaps the most visible example of this 
phenomenon was the demise of the papyrus scroll and the birth of 
the book in the context of the emergence of Christianity.
• 
The gradual replacement of scrolls by codices has been called “the 
most significant development in the history of the book before the 
invention of printing.” Several scholars have noted that the spread 
of the codex can be closely linked to the rise of Christianity, which 
adopted this format for the Greek texts of the New Testament. 
• 
One theory to explain the early Christian enthusiasm for the codex 
is that Christians repudiated the pagan contents of Egyptian papyrus 
scrolls, embracing the new codex technology as a departure from 
the past. It seems more likely, however, that the practical and 
economic advantages of codex technology won the day. 
• 
At its demise at the close of the 1st millennium A.D., the papyrus 
scroll was a venerable technology. The purely practical reasons 
for its passing carry an object lesson for us today, in the age of the 
e-book, which will, without question, eventually lead to the death 
of the printed book.

The Future of Writing
Lecture 24
A
s we’ve seen, grammatology (or comparative writing) is a historical 
science. In place of controlled experiments, such sciences rely on 
comparison, seeking out patterns and associations in a universe 
of diverse phenomena to infer general laws and testing those laws on new 
evidence when it becomes available. This methodology allows the historical 
sciences to retrodict the past with remarkable accuracy. But the turbulence 
inherent in complex, multifaceted, and interdependent systems, such as 
the weather or language, greatly limits our powers of prediction. We can’t 
predict the many possible futures of the world’s writing systems, but we can 
make reasonable speculations about what the future might bring, founded on 
the careful comparisons we’ve made in these lectures.
From Tablets to Papyrus
• 
In ancient Mesopotamia, clay tablets were the sine qua non of 
writing for almost 3,200 years, that is, from about 3100 B.C. until 
the last cuneiform inscription was written in the late 1st century 
A.D. The technology was simple but effective.
○
○
Clay tablets were intentionally flat on one side and convex 
on the other. The flat side was inscribed first, so that when 
the tablet was turned over, it could lay flat, protecting the 
inscription. Clay tablets were usually stored on shelves to dry, 
where they could be easily accessed. They could be altered at 
will, and if they were no longer wanted, they could be recycled. 
If a permanent record was desired, the clay could be baked in a 
fire. Scribes also supplemented clay tablets with hinged tablets 
that had a wax-coated writing surface.
○
○
Without doubt, both of these media were intractable. As we’ve 
seen, they drove changes in the form of signs, their orientations, 
and even the direction of writing. For these reasons, scribes 
must have been relieved when the Neo-Assyrian emperor 
Tiglath-Pīlēser III adopted the Aramaic language and script in 

190
Lecture 24: The Future of Writing
the middle of the 8th century B.C. The Aramaic script was an 
abjad, adapted from the Phoenician abjad, which means it had 
the same origin as our alphabet.
• 
As the years wore on, the advantages of writing an abjad on papyrus 
became increasingly obvious to scribes and rulers. The new script 
and technology finally succeeded in doing what thousands of years 
of conquest, reconquest, borrowing, adaptation, and imitation had 
never managed to do. After 3,200 years, scribes ceased writing 
cuneiform, adopting and adapting the Aramaic script to serve the 
needs of different languages and giving rise to the modern Hebrew 
and Arabic alphabets, among many others.
• 
Interestingly, the Aramaic abjad and its papyrus scrolls coexisted 
with the Assyrian logosyllabary and its clay tablets for almost 800 
years. But again, the outcome for tablets was inevitable and for 
the same practical reasons that e-books will eventually phase out 
printed books.
• 
In the last lecture, we discussed the chronology and rationale for 
the phasing out of papyrus scrolls by codices, but this, too, was a 
process that took some time to complete. From the first signs of the 
growing popularity of codices, in the 2nd century A.D., it took about 
800 years for scrolls to vanish entirely.
Printing and the Demise of the Codex
• 
The earliest printing was with fixed type, which means that a block 
of text was carved in the negative, usually on wood, and then covered 
with ink to create prints. This kind of printing first appeared in Han 
dynasty China around the beginning of the 3rd century A.D., but it 
wasn’t adapted to paper until sometime later. Because of the desire 
for more Chinese texts than calligraphers could supply, woodcut 
printing took off particularly rapidly in Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.
• 
The most significant development in printing was the invention of 
movable type: numerous copies of the same carved or cast signs 
that could be redistributed to print different works. 

191
○
○
Movable type was also first invented in China, in the early 11th 
century A.D., using porcelain, wood, and copper. The Koreans 
introduced bronze type in the early 13th century, but it never 
caught on because of the thousands of characters of Chinese 
writing, which made it expensive and inefficient. Instead, 
woodcut printing remained the most common method of 
Chinese printing until the modern era.
○
○
In the mid-15th century, Johannes Gutenberg developed the 
first modern movable type in Europe. He was the first to die-
cast his type from pliable but durable lead, as it’s still done 
today. The much smaller number of signs in the alphabet made  
metal typefaces much more practical than they were for 
Chinese characters. 
• 
When the Gutenberg Bible was published in 1455, Europeans were 
impressed by its relatively low price (compared with manuscripts), 
its high quality, and its consistency. Printing swept across Europe, 
signaling the end of the scriptorium and the codex. But once again, 
there was a sizable lag between the first invention of printing and 
the eventual demise of codices. 
• 
The advent of printing had other effects, too, both on the shape of 
our script and on its spelling conventions. Some characters that 
were problematic to typeset were basically discontinued. Printing 
also encouraged the idea of “correct” orthography—a single way 
that words ought to be spelled. As we’ve seen many times in these 
lectures, changes in media and the technology of writing can have 
unforeseen consequences in the shape, orientation, and orthographic 
rules of writing systems.
Keyboarding versus Handwriting
• 
If keyboards themselves aren’t overtaken by other technologies, 
typing is likely to replace handwriting. Keep in mind that new 
writing technologies never replace older ones overnight but only 
gradually edge them out over hundreds of years. In that light, 
consider that many of us no longer write much by hand.

192
Lecture 24: The Future of Writing
• 
Cursive instruction has all but ceased in public schools, and younger 
generations today write more text with their phones and laptops 
than they do by hand. This development is completely in keeping 
with what we’ve seen 
in our historical survey 
of writing technology: 
Practical new tools and 
media are gradually but 
inevitably adopted.
• 
As with the adoption of 
printing, the invention 
of the keyboard has led 
to the inventions of new 
signs and the innovation 
of 
new 
spelling 
conventions. 
The 
creation of emoticons 
can be traced to early computing in the 1980s, and they’re a useful 
addition to our textual repertoire. They supplement the question 
mark and the exclamation mark as ways to signal emotive and 
prosodic features of speech that are difficult to capture in writing.
• 
Orthographic developments in the domain of texting tend to be 
denigrated or even decried by language mavens as a debasement of 
our writing system, if not of our language itself. But such criticisms 
miss the fact that our writing system has never stood still. Signs and 
spelling practices alike have been altered, discarded, or introduced 
many times in the 1,000 years since Beowulf was written. Yet we 
still have an alphabet, and it still works in basically the same way.
Writing versus Machine Transcription
• 
The futurist William Crossman has predicted that writing itself will 
be phased out by the year 2050, at which point computers will be 
able to intelligently respond to our voices. Anyone will be able to 
communicate with anyone else, without ever needing to learn how 
to read and write. Illiteracy will vanish as a social concern.
The QWERTY arrangement continues 
to be used, even though its original 
rationale—to prevent typewriter keys from 
jamming—is no longer an issue.

193
• 
The anthropologist Dan Sperber agrees with the possibility that the 
ongoing revolution in information and communication technology 
might lead to the retirement of writing as an active process. That 
is, automatic machine transcription of speech might well replace 
our need to physically write things down for ourselves, even with  
a keyboard.
• 
Speech recognition software providing speech-to-text conversion 
still isn’t quite advanced enough for what either Crossman or 
Sperber envisions, but it’s developing rapidly, and it’s not hard to 
imagine a near future where a writer might draft books, articles, and 
lectures merely by speaking to a computer.
• 
It is unlikely, however, that the shape of the script produced by 
computers will change. Whether in hardcopy, on display screens, or 
in retinal readouts, English will most likely continue to be visually 
represented by the alphabet. 
○
○
The alphabet has now been with us for about 4,000 years, 
since its first invention in and around Egypt by early Semitic 
speakers. Since then, it has passed through the hands of the 
Phoenicians, Greeks, Etruscans, Romans, Normans, and 
Anglo-Saxons on its way to us. And each of these groups has 
made its own additions, alterations, and improvements.
○
○
The last really noteworthy improvement was the addition of 
vowels by the Greeks, which took place about 3,000 years 
ago. For this reason alone, the alphabet seems unlikely to 
change very much even if machine transcription of speech  
becomes commonplace. 
• 
Sperber argues that even in a future world where computers do 
all of our writing for us, it’s safe to predict that reading is here to 
stay. Even if everything you might want to read had already been 
digitized and stored in a computer, would you want to access it only 
by having it read to you? Would mothers no longer read to their 
children but have the computer do it for them?

194
Lecture 24: The Future of Writing
○
○
There are also practical disadvantages to reading everything 
by listening to a computer. Listening is much slower than 
reading, and there’s no possibility of easy backtracking by eye 
to double-check information presented earlier. 
○
○
Noise is also an issue; a speaking computer voice has to be 
loud enough for someone to hear, and the computer has to be 
able to hear its user. 
• 
An understanding of the root causes of illiteracy shows that even 
the demise of writing, as in Crossman’s vision, would probably do 
little to correct it.
○
○
Literacy is determined by economic, social, and political 
factors. Low literacy in African countries and in Afghanistan 
and Pakistan is the result of crushing poverty, repressive social 
policies, and a lack of political unity or, at least, of political 
clout for would-be reformers.
○
○
From this perspective, it’s difficult to see how Crossman’s 
golden age of talking computers could ever solve the problem 
of illiteracy, because neither the technological infrastructure 
nor the fiscal resources to take advantage of this kind of 
innovation exist in the places that have the lowest literacy  
rates today.
• 
Writing is only a little more than 5,000 years old, but in that 
relatively brief time, it has become integral to the way we function 
and relate to one another. Writing has changed, to be certain, and 
its changes and developments are directly linked to the story of 
civilization around the globe. Thus, it seems safe to predict that 
wherever human civilization goes, writing will always be with us.

Glossary
Glossary
abbreviation: A conventional incomplete spelling of a word (e.g., English 
Mr. for Mister). Abbreviations can seem like errors, but they’re usually 
systematic and codified. For instance, the Linear B, Mayan, and Aztec scripts 
routinely omit the spelling out of final consonants.
abjad (or consonantary): A writing system composed of consonantal signs 
only, such as Proto-Sinaitic and Phoenician. The term was coined by Peter 
Daniels (1990).
abugida (or alphasyllabary): A writing system composed of a mixture of 
consonantal signs and syllabic signs, such as Meroïtic and Devanagari. The 
term was coined by Peter Daniels (1990).
acrophony: Process whereby a phonetic sign originates from the initial 
sounds of a logogram.
agentive noun: Denotes a person, animal, or thing that performs a specified 
action or activity (e.g., worker, baker). In English, agentive nouns can be 
derived from verbs by adding -er. In Mayan, this is done by adding aj- (e.g., 
ajtz’ihb, “writer, scribe”).
’aleph: The first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, representing a glottal plosive 
consonant ([ʔ]). The Hebrew sign derives from Proto-Sinaitic, where it 
depicts an ox (Semitic: *’ālp).
allograph: Refers to the relationship between two or more graphically 
distinct signs that carry identical reading values. From a synchronic 
perspective, allographs are signs that are freely interchangeable. From a 
diachronic perspective, such signs are often the result of either sound change 
(where signs of different origin come to convey the same sound) or graphic 
divergence (where a sign takes on two different forms over time).
alphabet: A writing system composed of a mixture of consonantal and 
vocalic signs.

197
altar: An offering table used in ceremonies.
alveolar: Refers to a sound made by touching the tip of the tongue to the 
alveolar ridge behind the upper teeth (e.g., t, d, and n).
aspiration: Refers to a plosive sound made with forceful exhalation of 
breath, such as Greek ph. Because Latin did not have this sound, it borrowed 
Greek ph as f, accounting for the English pronunciation of such Greek-
derived words as physics (Greek: phusikē) and Philip (Greek: phillipos).
bilabial: Refers to a sound made by pressing both lips together (e.g., p, b, 
and m).
bilingual: An inscription containing two (or more) distinct languages, 
whether written in the same or different scripts. In cases where more than 
two languages are involved, scholars occasionally refer to the inscriptions as 
trilingual, quadrilingual, multilingual, and so on.
biscript: An inscription containing two (or more) distinct scripts, whether 
recording the same or different languages. In cases where more than two 
scripts are involved, scholars occasionally refer to them as triscripts, 
quadriscripts, multiscripts, and so on.
boustrophedon: Literally “ox turning (as it plows),” from Greek bous 
(“ox”) and strophē- (“turn”); refers to the alternating right-to-left and left-to-
right reading order (and sign reversals) of sequent lines in such scripts as the 
early Greek alphabet.
caption: A short text adjacent to an illustrated figure or object, which it 
names or describes.
cartouche: An oval encircling a group of Egyptian hieroglyphs and 
providing one of the names of the pharaoh.
case ending: An inflectional ending on a noun, adjective, or pronoun 
that expresses the semantic relationship of the word to other words in the

character: A complex sign in Chinese writing, most often composed of a 
phonetic sign and a semantic sign, but other combinations are also known.
code: A secret message. Codes are broken by code breakers (also 
cryptanalysts or cryptographers). Despite some overlap in methodology, 
code breaking is not decipherment.
codex (pl. codices): A bound manuscript (i.e., written by hand). Codices 
can be stacked and bound at one edge, like a modern book, or they can be 
continuous and screenfold.
cognate: The similarity of words in two different languages due to chance, 
to one language borrowing a word from the other, or to shared descent from 
a common ancestor, in which case the words are said to be cognate. 
comparative method: The method by which historical linguists compare 
related words in several related languages (i.e., cognates) in order to deduce 
the form and meaning of a word in their shared common ancestor.
complex sign (or compound sign, sign compound): A graphic unit with its 
own reading value, visually consisting of two or more otherwise independent 
signs. A relational unit is a special kind of complex sign.
consonant: A speech sound in which the breath is at least partly obstructed 
and which cannot form the nucleus of a syllable on its own (e.g., p).
consonantal sign: A phonetic sign representing a consonant, as in an abjad.

Cretan hieroglyphic: An undeciphered pictorial script from Crete, dating to 
c. 2200–1700 B.C.
cuneiform: Any of a large group of Near Eastern writing systems having 
wedge-shaped characters. Some of these scripts are historically related (e.g., 
Sumerian, Babylonian, and Hittite); others are merely visually influenced by 
them (e.g., Ugaritic, Old Persian).
cursive: Generally speaking, cursive refers to writing with joined characters, 
as in the longhand once taught in grade school. But some scripts designed for 
rapid writing with ink on paper are also known as cursive, such as Egyptian 
demotic, Japanese hiragana, and Aramaic abjad.
Cypriotic script (or Cypriotic syllabary): A syllabary from Cyprus, 
recording a dialect of ancient Greek and dating to c. 800–250 B.C. This 
script is related to both Linear A and Linear B.
Cyrillic: A Greek-derived alphabet named after the late-9th-century Greek 
missionary Saint Cyril and now used to write Russian, Ukrainian, and other 
Slavic languages.
damnatio memoriae: Latin for “condemnation of memory,” referring to a 
punishment of traitors by the Roman Senate, whose names were stricken 
from historical records.

details of sign types, orthography (i.e., spelling rules), and abbreviational 
conventions.
demotic: A visually simplified Egyptian logophonetic script developed in 
the 7th century B.C. One of the three scripts on the Rosetta Stone.
dental: Refers to a sound made by touching the bottom lip to the upper teeth 
(e.g., f, v), or the tip of the tongue to the teeth (e.g., voiced and voiceless th).
determinative: See semantic sign.

200
Glossary
diacritic: A sign that does not have a phonetic value of its own but signals 
a change in value of signs with which it is associated. In French, when the 
letter c appears with a cedilla (ç), it is no longer pronounced [k] but, rather, 
[s], as in the word façade.
dialect: A variant form of a language, usually defined by region, class, or 
socioeconomic group and distinguished from other variants by pronunciation, 
vocabulary, and grammar.
digraphia: Refers to a situation in which two different scripts are used 
by the same community, usually for different purposes. Modeled on the 
linguistic term diglossia, referring to the different sociopolitical functions of 
two languages in a single community.
diphthong: Complex vowels made up of two distinct vowels merged into a 
single syllable (e.g., the medial vowel ai in Modern English knight).
epigrapher (also epigraphist): Specialist in the study of writing systems.

methods, validity, and scope. The investigation of what distinguishes 
justified belief from opinion or tradition.
ethnonym: Proper name referring to an ethnic group.
etymology: The origin of a word and the historical development of its meaning.
featural script: A highly phonetic script in which sign organization and sign 
form are not arbitrary but, instead, encode phonetic features, such as place 
and manner of articulation, as in Korean Han'gŭl and Tolkien’s Tengwar and 
Certar. The term was coined by Geoffrey Sampson (1985).
frequency analysis: Study of the repetition of signs or sign groups in a text 
in order to draw conclusions based on the known frequencies of letters and 
words in the language it represents.

201
fricative: A consonant sound made through continuous expulsion of air past 
the point of articulation (e.g., f and sh [š]). Contrast with plosive.
gender marking: System by which nouns in a language carry special 
endings or require distinctive pronoun, adjective, and article forms. In Indo-
European languages, the genders are often masculine, feminine, and neuter. 
For example: German der Löffel (“the spoon”), die Gabel (“the fork”), and 
das Messer (“the knife”).
Germanic: A subgroup of the Indo-European family of languages that includes 
German, Dutch, Frisian, Swedish, Icelandic, and English, among others.

consisting of the vocal cords and the slitlike opening between them), such as 
fricative [h] and plosive [ʔ] (Hebrew ’aleph).
glyph: A convenient term for signs in any hieroglyphic script, abbreviated 
from hieroglyph.
grammatology: The comparative study of writing systems. The term 
was coined by Ignace Gelb (1952). A student of comparative writing is a 
grammatologist.
grapheme: See sign.
Great Vowel Shift: The 15th-century sound change that caused Middle 
English long vowels in stressed syllables to raise or become diphthongs, 
transforming the pronunciation of knight from ni:t to nait. In Old English, the 
word was pronounced knixt, where x represents the voiceless velar fricative.
Grimm’s law: A complex series of sound changes, first described by Jacob 
Grimm in 1822, that turned Proto-Indo-European p into Germanic f, among 
other related changes. Hence, Latin pater (which didn’t undergo the change) 
compared to English father (which did).
Han'gŭl (also Hangul): The 15th-century featural alphabet developed for 
Korean by King Sejong.

202
Glossary
Hànzì (also Hanzi): Literally, “Han sign”; the Mandarin term for  
Chinese characters.
haplography: A common abbreviational convention whereby repeating 
signs are omitted in writing, as in Mayan ka-wa for kakaw (“chocolate”) and 
u-ne for unen (“baby”).
hieratic: An early Egyptian logophonetic script designed for painting on 
papyrus. Replaced in most secular contexts by the demotic script in the 7th 
century B.C.
hieroglyph: Literally “sacred carving” (from Greek); now refers to single 
signs in a hieroglyphic script. Initially applied only to Egyptian but now 
freely used to describe many pictorial logophonetic scripts, such as Hittite 
(Luwian), Mayan, and Aztec.
hiragana: Japanese syllabary used to write inflectional endings on verbs and 
adjectives (behaving as phonetic complements) and to write grammatical 
particles and miscellaneous words that have no kanji (see below) or whose 
kanji are obscure.
historiography: The comparison and contrast of historical records to resolve 
biases and contradictions.
ideographic script: Refers to a writing system composed entirely of 
ideograms, that is, signs conveying meaning rather than sound. A conceptual 
category only because there are no such scripts. Grammatologists no longer 
consider ideogram a useful term.
Indo-European: The large language family now occupying most of Europe, 
Iran, and India and including English, Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. The 
common ancestor of these languages probably originated on the northern 
steppes of the Black Sea and is known as Proto-Indo-European.
inflectional language (or synthetic language): A language in which the 
grammatical relationships between words in a sentence are determined by 
inflections (such as case endings). Some languages, such as Nahuatl, are 

203
what might be called hyperinflectional, building lengthy words out of the 
agglutination of many distinct morphemes.
International Phonetic Alphabet (or IPA): An internationally recognized 
set of phonetic symbols designed to facilitate linguistic notation.
isolate: A language with no known relatives.
isolating language (or analytic language): A language in which the 
grammatical relationships between words in a sentence are determined by 
word order rather than case endings or similar grammatical inflections. 
kana: Either of the two Japanese syllabaries (katakana and hiragana).
kanji: The Japanese term for a borrowed Chinese character that can 
have reading values in either Japanese or Chinese (or both), based on the 
pronunciation and meaning of the sign at the time it was first borrowed. See 
kun and on.
katakana: Japanese syllabary used to spell names in foreign languages (not 
including Chinese) and for onomatopoeia, interjections, and emphasis.
kun (or kun’yomi): The value of a kanji based on the pronunciation of a 
native Japanese word that closely approximated its meaning when first 
introduced. Some kanji have multiple kun readings; others, none at all.
ligature: A logogram resulting from the fixed combination of two or more 
phonetic signs. For example, the ampersand sign (&) results from the 
combination of E and t (Latin et, “and”).
Linear A: An undeciphered logosyllabic script found mostly on Crete, 
Thera, and other Cycladic islands, dating to c. 1800–1450 B.C.
Linear B (also Mycenaean script): Logosyllabic script recording the 
Mycenaean Greek language, mostly known from Crete and mainland Greece 
and dating to c. 1450–1200 B.C. Deciphered by Michael Ventris in 1952.

204
Glossary
logogram (or logograph, lexical sign): Literally a “word sign,” a logogram 
denotes a specific word and its meaning in an underlying language.
logoconsonantal script: A writing system composed of logograms and 
consonantal signs.
logographic: Of or relating to logograms. (The adjectival form of the word 
logogram.)
logographic script: A writing system composed entirely of logograms. 
A conceptual category only because there are no known writing systems 
without phonetic signs.
logophonetic script: A writing system composed of logograms and phonetic 
signs (without specifying whether the latter are consonantal, alphabetic,  
or syllabic).
logosyllabic script (or logosyllabary): A writing system composed of 
logograms and syllabic signs, such as Mayan and Aztec writing.
manner of articulation: Refers to the way in which air pressure, vocal cords, 
and other features help to produce a sound (e.g., plosive, fricative, nasal).
man’yogana: The early Chinese characters used in 5th-century Japan for 
their sound values alone, eventually giving rise to the two kana syllabaries.
Mayan: Refers to a large group of related languages and their speakers in 
Mexico and Central America. By convention, Maya refers to the people and 
their culture, whereas Mayan specifically refers to language.
Mesopotamia: The land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present-
day Iraq; a rich alluvial plain sometimes called the “fertile crescent.” 
Mesopotamia was the site of the ancient civilizations of Akkad, Assyria, 
Babylonia, Elam, and Sumer.
mixed script: A general term for a logophonetic script.

205
monogenesis: The theory that writing was invented only once (usually in 
Mesopotamia), after which it diffused to all later groups.
morpheme: The smallest indivisible unit of meaning in a language. The 
English word tapping is composed of two morphemes: the verbal root 
tap and the bound morpheme -ing, indicating a participle or gerund. (The 
doubled p is an orthographic device cueing the short vowel of tap in tapping, 
rather than the historic long vowel of tape in taping.)
Nahuatl: The language of the Aztecs and many of their neighbors in Central 
Mexico. A member of the widespread Uto-Aztecan language family and the 
language recorded in the Aztec script.
nasal: Refers to a voiced sound made by resonating the nasal cavity, such as 
m, n, and ŋ (the consonant known as engma and written -ng in the English 
word sing).
numeral (or numeric sign): A sign for a number, such as the Arabic 
numerals 1, 2, and 3.
obelisk: A monumental stone pillar, usually with a square cross section and 
a pyramidal apex.
on (or on’yomi): The value of a kanji based on the Japanese pronunciation 
of its Chinese reading when first introduced. Some kanji have multiple on 
readings, whereas those invented more recently in Japan usually have none.
onomastics: The field of study concerning the origin, construction, and 
meaning of names.
palatal: A sound made with the hard palate, such as ch ([č]) or sh ([š]). The 
linguistic term palatalization applies to the change of a velar sound, such as 
k, into č or š.
papyrus: A tall, aquatic sedge (Cyperus papyrus), native to central Africa 
and the Nile valley and from which the earliest paper was made. Early 

206
Glossary
Semitic and Greek words for this plant are the sources of the English words 
paper, bible, and bibliography.
pars pro toto: A visual abbreviation common to hieroglyphic writing 
systems, whereby a distinctive part of a sign can stand for the whole, as the 
Maya ka syllable (a fish or just its fins); the Aztec ITZ sign, “obsidian” (an 
obsidian-edged weapon or just its blade); and the Egyptian r‘ sign, “sun” 
(the god Horus with solar disk headdress or just the disk).
pharyngeal: A sound produced by articulating the root of the tongue with 
the pharynx, as in the Semitic consonant ’ayin.
phoneme: A sound that, in contrast with other sounds, contributes to the 
set of meaningful phonetic contrasts in a given language. By convention, 
linguists enclose phonemes in forward slashes (e.g., /p/) to distinguish them 
from mere phonetic sounds, conventionally enclosed in square brackets 
(e.g., [p]). In English /b/ and /p/ are different phonemes because bit and pit 
contrast meaningfully. In Korean,
(“light”) can be pronounced either 
[bit] or [pit]; thus, [b] and [p] do not contrast and are not distinct phonemes.
phonetic sign (or phonogram): A sign for an abstract sequence of sound. 
Phonetic signs do not carry meaning and come in numerous formal varieties, 
including consonants (C), vowels (V), consonant groups (CC and CCC), 
consonant-vowel groups (CV), vowel-consonant groups (VC), and even 
consonant-vowel-consonant groups (CVC). But no script has all of these 
forms. For instance, Egyptian phonetic signs are only C, CC, and CCC (e.g., 
n, nb, and nfr) and Maya phonetic signs are only V and CV (e.g., a and ka).
phonetic complement: A phonetic sign used to clarify the reading of an 
associated logogram, indicating (and at least partially reiterating) its reading. 
Often, this is done to provide a grammatical inflection to a verb root provided 
by the logogram, as in Japanese and Mayan.
phonetic-semantic sign: Refers to the most common kind of Chinese 
character, which combines a semantic sign indicating the semantic class of a 
word with a phonetic sign indicating its pronunciation (minus tone).

207
pictography (also picture writing): A system of nonlinguistic graphic 
communication conveying information through imagery and context. Most 
writing systems have signs that originated pictographically, but this says 
nothing about the function of those signs in a writing system, which will 
always be phonetic, logographic, or semantic. Grammatologists have retired 
the term pictogram (or pictograph) as a sign type.
picture biscript: A close association between text and image (as in a 
caption), whereby the image provides a helpful constraint on the meaning 
of the text.
Pinyin: The standard system of Romanized spelling for transliterating 
Chinese writing; from Mandarin 
, pīn-yīn, literally “spell-sound.”
plosive (also stop): A consonant sound made by briefly building up pressure 
behind the point of articulation and then releasing it, as in p, b, and k. 
Contrast with fricative.
place (or point) of articulation: Refers to the location in the mouth where 
a sound is made or the parts of the mouth responsible for a sound (e.g., 
bilabial, dental, alveolar, palatal, velar, glottal).
polygenesis: The theory that writing was independently invented several 
times in different parts of the world.
polyvalent sign (or homograph): A sign with two or more reading values, 
such as most Japanese kanji and many cuneiform logograms.
proper name (also proper noun or rigid designator): A name used for a 
specific person, place, or thing. In English, proper names always receive 
initial capital letters.
Proto-Sinaitic: The oldest known ancestor of the alphabet, a pictorial abjad 
dating to the mid-19th century B.C. and currently attested in the southwest 
Sinai Peninsula and Middle Egypt.
radical: See semantic sign.

208
Glossary
rebus: A principle of logophonetic scripts whereby a logogram is used for 
its phonetic value to signal a homophonous word (e.g., Mayan BAAH, 
“gopher,” used to write baah, “head”).
relational unit (or relational sign): A type of logogram in which two 
preexisting signs are combined to convey a third concept, as when the 
Chinese logogram 
, rì (“sun”), and 
, yuè (“moon”), combine to form 
, míng (“bright”).
representational sign (also iconic sign): A type of logogram in which the 
form or orientation of the sign visually signals the word referred to, such as 
the Chinese signs for the numbers 
 1, 
 2, and 
 3.
romaji: Japanese term for the Roman alphabet borrowed to transliterate 
kanji, hiragana, and katakana.
rune (also runic): The alphabet adopted by Germanic peoples in the 2nd 
century A.D. The early and continental variants are known as the fuþark 
(after the first six signs), whereas the later Anglo-Saxon derivation is known 
as the fuþorc (as the result of sound change in the fourth sign).
semantic sign (also determinative, taxon, or radical): A sign without a 
phonetic value of its own, but which signals the semantic class to which 
an associated logogram or group of phonetic signs belongs. What Linear B 
scholars traditionally call an ideogram is, thus, a semantic sign.
Semitic: A large family of languages spoken in the Middle East and Ethiopia, 
including Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, and the now-extinct Babylonian. Best 
known for its three-consonant word roots, e.g., Arabic KTB (“write”), giving 
kataba (“he wrote”), maktab (“office”), and so on. The common ancestor of 
these languages is known as Proto-Semitic.
shorthand: A method of rapid writing by means of abbreviation and 
phonetic signs, especially for taking dictation. The most popular systems 
were designed by Isaac Pitman and John R. Gregg in the late 19th century; 
both are featural scripts.

209
sign (or grapheme): An irreducible graphic unit of a script possessing its 
own reading value. The major sign types are logograms, phonetic signs, 
semantic signs, diacritics, and numerals.
Sino-Tibetan: A language family that includes Chinese, Tibetan, and 
many other languages of southern and southeast Asia. Tonal contrasts are a 
common feature of these languages. 
stela (pl. stelae): A common format for carved monuments, the stela is a 
freestanding, dressed stone slab erected in a public space to commemorate 
important events.
syllabic sign (or syllabogram): A phonetic sign representing a pronounceable 
syllable and, therefore, always including a vowel either alone or preceded 
and/or followed by a consonant. For example, the Maya signs a and ka are 
syllabic signs, as are the Aztec signs o, to, and ol.
syllabary: A writing system composed, in whole or in part, of syllabic signs. 
The Inuktitut syllabary is composed entirely of syllabic signs, but most 
syllabaries are part of more complex scripts. Examples of these include 
Linear B (with its many semantic signs), Old Persian (with a few logograms), 
Mayan (with hundreds of logograms), and Japanese (with two syllabaries 
and thousands of logograms).
taxon: See semantic sign.
Tengwar (also Tîw): A calligraphic featural script invented by J.R.R. Tolkien.
theonym: Proper name referring to a god.
thorn (also þorn): Name of the first letter in the runic alphabets, þ, standing 
for the voiced and unvoiced dental fricative th.
tone: Refers to a phonemic pitch carried by vowels, as in Chinese and other 
Sino-Tibetan languages. Tone usually results from compensation for the loss 
of earlier consonants.

210
Glossary
toponym: Proper name referring to a place.
velar: A sound made with the velum or soft palate, such as k.
vocalic sign: A sign representing a vowel.
voicing: Refers to the vibration of the vocal cords in the production of 
various sounds, such as vowels and the voiced consonants b, d, and g.
vowel: A speech sound produced by a relatively open vocal tract, with 
vibration of the vocal cords but without audible friction. Usually forms 
the nucleus of a syllable. Depending on where they are made in the mouth, 
vowels can be classified as high (i, u), mid (e, o), low (a), front (e, i), and 
back (o, u). Thus, i is high front vowel; o a mid back one.
word sign: see logogram.
writing: A system of graphic marks representing the sounds and words of 
spoken language. As DeFrancis noted: “writing is visible speech.”
