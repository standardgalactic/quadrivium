 Equifax‚Äôs lack of security before the breach and 
their reaction after the breach are deplorable. 
Financial restitution should be so great that it 
buries the company, making it an example so all 
other corporations take security of consumer data 
seriously.
‚Äîzsukm007
Sascha, you nailed it when you said that 
consumers cannot choose not to use Equifax. Any 
corporation that collects personal data on 
consumers must secure that data with the latest 
and toughest security measures available; it‚Äôs the 
law in many states. Data needs to be 
compartmentalized so that any single breach will 
not yield complete data. The fallout from this data 
breach may wind up damaging the U.S. economy 
worse than any recession.

Over the weekend I watched a show I had 
recorded a couple of weeks back. I was treated to 
a commercial for Equifax‚Äôs identity theft

and delicious.

Well, half of the U.S. population now has their data in criminal hands... The data can 
never be unstolen. We just need the other half of the population to have their data

people who work at Equifax.

IBM Fits AI Wave Forecaster on 
a Raspberry Pi  BY STEPHANIE MLOT  
S
cientists have developed an advanced wave forecasting system that can 
run speedy simulations on a Raspberry Pi. Using deep learning, analysts 
at IBM Research Ireland, Baylor University, and the University of Notre 
Dame built a system that far outpaces existing prediction models.
Costly and sluggish traditional platforms require a supercomputer to calculate 
KRZWLGHVZLQGVDQGWKHRFHDQ¬∂VYDU\LQJGHSWKVLQ√ÄXHQFHWKHVSHHGDQGKHLJKW

forecasts up to 12,000 percent faster than conventional designs, according to 
IBM Research member Fearghal O‚ÄôDonncha, who also tipped ‚Äúa vastly 
increased‚Äù set of data input.

WHAT‚ÄôS NEW NOW

‚ÄúAccurate forecasts of ocean wave heights and directions are 
a valuable resource for many marine-based industries,‚Äù 
O‚ÄôDonncha wrote in a blog post. ‚ÄúMany of these industries 
operate in harsh environments where power and computing 
facilities are limited. A solution to provide highly accurate 
wave condition forecasts at low computational cost is 
essential for improved decision making.‚Äù

put the time-honored Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) 
model to work‚Äîgenerating training data (four years of 
forecasts, from April 2013 to July 2017) for their deep 
learning network. A roaring success, the AI replicated 
images of more than 3,000 wave heights and periods with 
fewer errors than SWAN.
‚ÄúDespite the huge reduction in computational expense, the 
new approach provides comparable levels of accuracy to the 
traditional physics-based SWAN model,‚Äù O‚ÄôDonncha said.
Not yet ready for primetime, the surrogate system is vetted 
only in Monterey Bay, CA. To expand the model, researchers

eeks after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico remains in desperate 
straits. The island‚Äìwhich is an American territory and whose 
citizens are full citizens of the United States according to both 
Supreme Court rulings and acts of Congress‚Äìis still almost entirely without 
power. Virtually every aspect of disaster recovery, from medical treatment to 
home reconstruction, either requires or is made orders of magnitude easier by 
electricity. And Maria didn‚Äôt just wreck Puerto Rico‚Äôs generating stations; it 
destroyed the entire transmission grid.
Elon Musk has offered to help Puerto Rico out, possibly by deploying solar 
power around the island. Puerto Rico is ideally situated for solar power in many 
respects. It‚Äôs relatively close to the equator‚Äîcloser than any location in the 
continental U.S. ‚Äîand it enjoys high amounts of sunshine for most of the year. 
Elon Musk Could Help Puerto Rico 
Rebuild With Solar Power  BY JOEL HRUSKA  
NEWS STORY
WHAT‚ÄôS NEW NOW

Musk‚Äôs company, SolarCity, has been absorbed by 
Tesla and has been looking for ways to scale its 
battery projects to more customers. Puerto Rico, 
with its 3.5 million inhabitants, would be an 
enormous lift for Tesla, possibly more than the 
company can really handle at this point. Tesla‚Äôs 
similar efforts in American Samoa extended solar 
power and battery storage to an island with 
roughly 1,000 inhabitants. Puerto Rico has a 
population more than 1,000 times larger.

a long-term project; as The Verge noted, a Twitter

Historically, Puerto Rico has faced the second-highest electrical costs of any 
U.S. state save Hawaii, and its power grid was never in particularly good shape. 
Before Maria, Puerto Rico‚Äôs power was generated by petroleum (47 percent), 
natural gas (34 percent), coal (17 percent), and renewable power (2 percent). 
The island has no reserves of any fossil fuel, which means all its conventional

shutdown in 2009.
Building a power grid for the island that would cut its reliance on imported 
fossil fuels would be a major improvement, but it‚Äôd also be extremely expensive. 
There‚Äôs a great deal of work to do to hammer out any concrete proposals, and 
it‚Äôs not yet clear what kind of funding will be available. Puerto Rico‚Äôs economy 
was in terrible shape before Maria, with a debt load of over $70 billion. Now the 
island‚Äôs situation is even worse, and as of this writing, we have no information 
on how or what Congress will do to help the territory‚Äîwhose citizens are as 
American as any Texan or Floridian‚Äîrecover. The U.S. government helped fund 
Musk‚Äôs previous work in American Samoa, but whether it will extend such 
support to the ravaged island of Puerto Rico is anyone‚Äôs guess.

n the wake of the massive Equifax data breach, once again a spotlight has 
been shone on the overuse of the not-so-secret number that passes for a 
national ID in the United States‚Äîthe Social Security Number (SSN). 
Perhaps we have become numb to these hacks and data breaches. What, my 
credit card number was compromised? The credit card company will cancel it 
and issue another one. My address information? My cell number? Well that‚Äôs 
already out there in many places. My bank account number? Whatever, I‚Äôll 
change it.
Hold it‚Äîsomeone got my SSN? That‚Äôs not an easy one to change. And 
unfortunately, it‚Äôs overused for identity not just by government agencies but

It‚Äôs Time for a Digital Universal ID  
BY BEN ALGAZE 
NEWS STORY
WHAT‚ÄôS NEW NOW

ORIGINS OF THE SSN
The SSN was never designed to be a universal ID. It was designed to uniquely 
identify an individual, track their lifetime earnings, and enable them to collect 
WKHLUEHQH¬øWVXSRQUHWLUHPHQW7KH,56DQGDKRVWRIRWKHUJRYHUQPHQW

ODFNRIDQ\RWKHUIRUPRIXQLYHUVDOLGHQWL¬øFDWLRQDGRSWHGLWDVDIRUPRI
establishing accounts unambiguously. And it has become a requirement for 
KDYLQJDEDQNDFFRXQWDQGPRVWDQ\RWKHU¬øQDQFLDOVHUYLFH
The SSN is the key to all the information major credit bureau companies such 
DV(TXLID[KROGDERXWXV¬≤\HWJLYHQKRZRIWHQ\RXXVHLWIRULGHQWL¬øFDWLRQLW
can‚Äôt be considered a secret, like a password can. In 2009, researchers at 
Carnegie Mellon University found that they could develop an algorithm to guess 
SSNs from publicly available information. Part of the reason for that is the 
original structure of the SSN itself, which is based on the state of issue and is 
clustered around birth dates. Since the late 1980s, SSNs have been 
automatically issued at birth. Knowing where and when someone was born‚Äî
something freely divulged by many on Facebook‚Äîcan help a hacker derive a 
SSN with a guessing algorithm and a reasonably powerful laptop.
So the SSN is not a secure form of ID in today‚Äôs internet-connected world. 
What‚Äôs the alternative? After 9/11, the issue of secure national IDs came up as a 
way to ensure against forgeries of ID documents for travel and other purposes. 
In 2001, Larry Ellison of Oracle called for a 
cryptographically secure 
national ID and 
offered to provide 
the needed 
technology free of 
charge. The 
reaction was 
predictable, as 
conservatives, 
libertarians, and civil 
liberties groups concerned 
about privacy were adamantly 
against the concept.

:KLOHWKHUHFRQWLQXHVWREH¬øHUFHUHVLVWDQFHWRWKHDERYHLGHDRWKHUHIIRUWVIRU

MODERN UNIVERSAL ID DESIGN
Outside of the U.S., perhaps the most ambitious national I.D. effort is Aadhaar 
in India, which now encompasses 1.2 billion people. Originally begun in 2009 
as a way to uniquely identify people for government social-welfare services, it 
KDVEHFRPHDOOEXWPDQGDWRU\LGHQWL¬øFDWLRQIRUWUDYHO¬øQDQFLDOVHUYLFHVDQG

well, it is‚Äîexcept Aadhaar is a system based on modern technology, employing 
¬øQJHUSULQWVLULVVFDQVDQGSKRWRVDVXQLTXHLGHQWL¬øHUV

Some critics in India are concerned about the implications of allowing private 
companies tapping into the system. Earlier this year, Microsoft showed a demo 
in Mumbai of its new Skype Lite service using Aadhaar to uniquely identify a 
user. While the authorization process is similar to using a Facebook or Google 
login authorization to identify someone on the web (which in those cases do not 
WUXO\VHUYHDVDQLGHQWL¬øFDWLRQRIDUHDOSHUVRQLQWKDWWKHGDWDDERXWWKH
identity is not passed on, the security and privacy concerns are valid.
*LYHQWKDWWKH$DGKDDUV\VWHPVWRUHVSK\VLFDOLGHQWL¬øFDWLRQGDWDDVZHOODVD
host of demographic information, a major concern is that if it‚Äôs compromised, 
it‚Äôs really a single point of failure with disastrous consequences for the myriad 
services that depend on it. While Aadhaar employs state-of-the-art encryption, 
usually the compromise to such a system comes from a weaker link‚Äîan 
improperly designed or unaudited mobile or web app or a phishing scam that 
steals a credential from someone with wide access to the system.

We willingly trade privacy for free internet services from Facebook, Google,

not kept up.

Databases that serve the health insurance industry have 
collected a mountain of information about our health 
history, including hospitalizations, diagnoses, 
treatments, and drugs prescribed. A universal ID might

Finally, the NSA has the computing power to track 
every unencrypted voice, data, and email message in 
the country, in the name of national security. And it is 
used for that purpose. We think. 
The point? Privacy is almost nonexistent in today‚Äôs 
world. But that doesn‚Äôt necessarily imply either private 
companies or the government are using this 
information in nefarious ways, although we know that 
has happened and will continue to happen in the future.

from using modern technology to solve a real

in place to guard against misuse.

NerdWallet actually answers a lot of those questions

they go to search but you‚Äôre doing something more

FRPLQJPLOOHQQLDORUDQ\PLOOHQQLDOWRJHWEHWWHU¬øQDQFLDO
advice, know what to do next, and get the facts?
What makes NerdWallet different than all of the 
other Ô¨Ånancial how-to sites on the internet?
NerdWallet‚Äôs obsessively consumer-centric. I actually 
spend a ton of my time going around the country, going 
into people‚Äôs living rooms, showing them NerdWallet, 
DVNLQJWKHPTXHVWLRQVDERXWWKHLU¬øQDQFLDOOLYHVHWFMXVW
to understand what they need. That permeates throughout 
the whole company. My hope is, when you go to 
NerdWallet, it‚Äôs very obvious that level of care and detail 
has gone into everything we write, every product we create. 
We develop our roadmaps based on consumer need, not 
based on a top-down view of the business.
Unless you 
have a great 
Ô¨Ånancial 
advisor who‚Äôs 
guiding you 
along, you 
don‚Äôt know 
what to do 
next. 

People come to you for recommendations on 
everything from credit cards to mortgages. Can 
you talk a little bit about sort of the mix of 
Ô¨Ånancial products that you cover?
7KHUHDUHRUPDMRU¬øQDQFLDOSURGXFWV,I,¬∂PJRLQJ
to simplify the banking space, it‚Äôs you either have too 
little money, too much money, or you need to insure 
something. When you have too little money, it‚Äôs usually 
for a college education, a car, or a house. When you 
have too much money, you‚Äôre thinking about investing, 
and you‚Äôre insuring your life or your car or your house. 
That‚Äôs kind of the universe of products, so we cover all 
that. I think one of the biggest issues that students face 
LVWKH\GRQ¬∂WNQRZKRZWR¬øOORXWWKHIHGHUDODSSOLFDWLRQ

¬øOORXWWKH)$)6$IRUPIRUFROOHJHDQGWKDWNLQGRI
thing as well.
That seems to get to the crux of the matter, which 
is that people don‚Äôt understand that there are 
such things as Ô¨Ånancial products. They just think 
that there are things they have to pay for, and 
they don‚Äôt necessarily know the best way to go 
about it.
Exactly. How you typically go about getting something 
like a student loan or a mortgage is you either talk to 
8QFOH%REVRZHKHDUDORWRIWKDWRU\RXMXVWGRZKDW
the banker told you at your local branch. And that‚Äôs not 
VKRSSLQJ,QIDFWDORWRIWKHVH¬øQDQFLDOLQVWLWXWLRQVDUH
able to make so much money because they leverage 
their direct relationships with you to give you products

WKHLQWHUQHW3ULFLQJLVLQWHUHVWUDWHVRUIHHVLQ¬øQDQFLDO
products. We try to surface all those things very 
transparently.
If I‚Äôm going to 
simplify the 
banking space, 
it‚Äôs you either 
have too little 
money, too much 
money, or you 
need to insure 
something. 

There are some core concepts that people miss, 
too. When you go shopping for mutual funds, for 
example, and you get managed funds, the fees 
associated with those funds seem very, very small 
when you buy into the fund. But then when you 
start calculating what those fees would cost over 
a 20-year period or a 30-year period, the 
difference is huge. Most people just have no 
innate understanding of that opportunity that 
they‚Äôre losing.
Right. One of my painful moments of the last three 
years was when my parents called me and said, ‚ÄúHey, 
ZHMXVWSXWPRQH\LQWRWKLVIXQG7KHUH¬∂VVRPH
percent upfront fee and it locks rates and all this 
FRPSOLFDWHGVWXII¬¥,ZDVMXVWOLNH¬≥2KPDQ1RW\RX
guys too.‚Äù Right?
Did they not know what you did? Have they not 
visited your site?
They‚Äôre very independent. They visit the site, they use 
our credit card products. But they didn‚Äôt even think that 
there could be this kind of landmine when it came to 
buying managed funds.
My stepfather does the same thing when he goes 
shopping for cameras. He‚Äôs always sending me the 
camera that he just bought. I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúDid you look 
at the reviews on PCMag? You know I do this full-
time.‚Äù So we have that in common. Let‚Äôs talk a 
little bit about that, the idea of Ô¨Ånancial literacy. 
It‚Äôs not something that we teach in elementary 
school. It‚Äôs not something we teach in high school. 
You can graduate college without ever having a 
basic understanding of how compound interest 
works. Where are we falling down, and what do we 
need to close that gap?
One of my painful 
moments of the 
last three years 
was when my 
parents called 
me and said, 
‚ÄòHey, we just put 
money into this 
fund.‚Äô

The way I think about that problem is, people who are about to become 
¬øQDQFLDOO\>LQGHSHQGHQW@DUHW\SLFDOO\KLJKVFKRROWRFROOHJHWKDWWUDQVLWLRQ:H
need to teach them some basics, but it‚Äôs completely impractical to teach them 
everything. It‚Äôs like asking them to memorize Wikipedia. First of all, what‚Äôs the 
SRLQW"6HFRQGRIDOOZHMXVWZDQWWKHPWRPDNHJRRGGHFLVLRQVQRWWRNQRZ
everything. So to your point, I think there are some basics like compounding 
interest, how credit scores work, when you need to buy certain things, that we 
can do right around that age. The rest of it, I think there are resources like 
1HUG:DOOHWZKHUHZKHQ\RXJRDVNDVSHFL¬øFTXHVWLRQ\RX¬∂UHJRLQJWRJHWEDFN
a really clear answer. So I think that‚Äôs where technology should supplement.
I think that one of the cool things about NerdWallet is that it makes 
managing your money kind of fun, as opposed to something you dread. 
You can see it in the way the stories are written and the way the advice 
is given. How much of that is designed to appeal to the millennial 
market and how much appeals to everyone across any age group?
We have a bullseye of what we‚Äôre going for and it‚Äôs certainly people who are 
VWDUWLQJRXWDQGVHWWOLQJLQLQWKHLU¬øQDQFLDOOLYHVVRPD\EHUHFHQWFROOHJHJUDGV

someone who‚Äôs already bought a home, who‚Äôs already set up a retirement plan. 
That group is often more hesitant to link their bank accounts or to get their 
credit score for free. There‚Äôs this huge rift. Often, we can see people who think 
our name is ridiculous and before that, there‚Äôs all these people that are like, 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the best thing ever,‚Äù so that‚Äôs right around when the rift happens.

R
ay Kurzweil, one of the most forward-
thinking scientists alive today, has a 
pretty good track record when it comes 
to tech predictions, including his 1990 prediction 
about the rise of the internet.
In a 2015 piece for SingularityHub, Peter 
Diamandis‚Äîa visionary in his own right and 
someone who knows Kurzweil well‚Äîoutlined 
some of his favorite Kurzweil predictions for the 
next 25 years, including: ‚ÄúBy the 2040s, non-
biological intelligence will be a billion times more 
capable than biological intelligence (a.k.a. us). 
Nanotech foglets will be able to make food out of 
thin air and create any object in physical world at 
a whim.‚Äù And this as well: ‚ÄúBy 2045, we will 
multiply our intelligence a billionfold by linking 
wirelessly from our neocortex to a synthetic 
neocortex in the cloud.‚Äù
Both predictions fascinate and scare me at the 
same time. Given my age, I probably won‚Äôt be 
around to see robots becoming smarter than us. 
And as a serious foodie, I am not sure I like the 
idea of nanotech foglets taking control in the 
kitchen, although that sure could help solve the 
world‚Äôs food crisis.
Don‚Äôt Let Innovation 
Widen the Gap Between 
Haves & Have-Nots
Tim Bajarin
COMMENTARY
Tim Bajarin is the 
president of Creative 
Strategies and a 
consultant, analyst, 
and futurist covering 
personal computers 
and consumer 
technology.

As for multiplying our intelligence by a 
billionfold, the big questions are, what 
competitive advantage does that give a person, 
and at what cost? Imagine the potential gulf 
between the haves and have-nots that could arise.
If we don‚Äôt control this with serious ethical checks 
and balances, we are inviting chaos despite these 
technologies‚Äô great value. I‚Äôve said it before, but 
I‚Äôm deeply concerned that our tech creators do 
not look hard enough at the possible downside 
their creations have on mankind.
The result of this myopic thinking is that we now 
are seeing serious governmental interest and 
legitimate queries into the impact of technology 
for good and evil. In talking with many major 
high-tech companies, they are not equipped to 
deal with governmental intervention.
Kurzweil‚Äôs predictions are fascinating and should 
be taken seriously. But I would suggest 
considering how these innovations impact 
society. For Silicon Valley to continue to drive our 
tech world, these types of deep-thinking exercises 
must become part of its DNA. If not, our future 
might not be as bright as some think it will be.

development of smart guns (although its history suggests otherwise) as 
long as smart guns aren‚Äôt the only option for gun buyers. I think it‚Äôs 
time for us all (the NRA especially) to rethink that stance. After all, this 
isn‚Äôt a new issue: Smith & Wesson experimented with ‚Äúchild proof‚Äù 
revolvers back in the 1880s.
Opponents of smart gun technology will say government overreach will 
prohibit gun owners from achieving what the Second Amendment 
intends: For the people to bear arms for their own security, even if that 
means security against the government itself. To this, I have no 
argument. It‚Äôs true. If the government wants to lock a registered smart 
weapon that belongs to one of its own citizens, future technology will 
likely make this possible. But just as we concede location-based privacy 
to businesses, mobile carriers, and the government in order to make 
calls, to receive coupons, and to play Pokemon Go, we‚Äôll have to

Other smart gun opponents will argue that technological glitches and 
REVWDFOHVZLOOPDNHVPDUWJXQVGLI¬øFXOWRULPSRVVLEOHWRRSHUDWH%XW
technology requires trial and error, and trial and error breeds 
frustration (I still haven‚Äôt been able to download iOS 11). But we‚Äôve 
improved TVs from black-and-white, staticky, blurry images to 4K live 
video shot from a cell phone and beamed to a 70-inch, wall-mounted 
device. Eventually we‚Äôll move to a place where smart guns are more fun, 
√ÄXLGDQGVDIHUWRXVHWKDQDQDORJZHDSRQVEXWZHKDYHWRVWDUW
somewhere.
A third group of opponents will argue that smart guns will be too 
H[SHQVLYH7KH\¬∂UHULJKW$W¬øUVWVPDUWJXQVZLOOEHPRUHH[SHQVLYH
than current bottom-shelf weapons. But, like any technology, as more 
competitors enter the arena, as manufacturing becomes easier, and as

portable computer, the Osborne 1, debuted in 1981 at $1,795. Today, 
you can buy an incredible laptop for as little as $269.
Juan Martinez

Finally, and perhaps most frustratingly, gun 
owners will argue that it isn‚Äôt fair to take away 
guns that don‚Äôt possess smart technology. Why, 
though? When seat-belt laws went into effect in 
1968, it was forbidden for manufacturers to 
produce cars without seat belt technology. This 
was probably annoying for people who were used 
to hopping in a car and driving away untethered, 
but think about how many lives were saved. 
People didn‚Äôt abandon driving. In fact, I‚Äôd 
venture to say that more people drive today, to 
more places, at greater speeds, thanks to the 
invention and enforcement of the seat belt. And 
no, while it‚Äôs not illegal to drive a pre-seat-belt 
classic car, I‚Äôd bet that most people who could 
install a seatbelt in their classic car without 
VDFUL¬øFLQJWKHLQWHJULW\RIWKHYHKLFOH¬∂VDHVWKHWLFV
(or excessive cost) would do so.
But here‚Äôs the problem: We‚Äôre not talking about 
these issues. We need less partisan bickering and

think tanks, the CDC, and on Capitol Hill. 
Whatever the experts conclude, I‚Äôm willing to bet 
that most Americans‚Äîliberal or conservative, 
pro- or anti-gun‚Äîwould be optimistic about a 
future with fewer gun deaths.

Ten Top Smart Home Devices
EDITORS‚Äô CHOICE

Amazon Echo Dot
$49.99
 
L l l l m
The original Echo is a Bluetooth speaker powered by Alexa, Amazon‚Äôs handy voice assistant. 
Alexa works with a number of smart home devices directly, as well as with If This Then That 
(IFTTT) to control plenty of others via ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù you can create yourself. It‚Äôll take some work, 
but you can use Alexa to control most of the gadgets in your house by the sound of your 
voice. If you already have a favorite speaker, the inexpensive Echo Dot can connect to it and 
add Alexa functionality. And if you want a touch screen to see search results and make video 
calls, check out the Echo Show.
Netgear Arlo Pro
$249.00
L l l l h
When we reviewed the Netgear Arlo back in 2015, we loved that it was 
completely wireless, weatherproof, and easy to install, but we were 
disappointed that it had no audio capabilities. The Netgear Arlo Pro not 
only adds two-way audio‚Äîit also offers sound-triggered recording. 
Other new features include rechargeable batteries, a base station with 
a loud siren, and USB connectivity for storing video locally on a USB 
drive. You don‚Äôt need to pay for a pricey subscription to view recordings 
that are stored in the cloud, and its wireless capabilities give you much 
more Ô¨Çexibility when you‚Äôre deciding where to place your cameras than 
most competitors.
August Smart Lock HomeKit Enabled
$199.99
L l l l h
The big names in door locks have smart home 
options, but they haven‚Äôt pulled it off as well as 
upstart August. Its easy-to-install, Apple HomeKit-
enabled Smart Lock mounts over your existing dead-
bolt switch to provide connectivity for your door. It 
speaks via Bluetooth to your smartphone, granting 
quick access to you or guests. The latest version inte-
grates tightly with Apple devices but still has support 
from other services, such as IFTTT.

Nest Learning Thermostat
$248.80
L l l l m
The Nest Learning Thermostat has built-in Wi-Fi so you can 
remotely control the temperature from phone, tablet, or 
PC. This latest generation has a larger display and a few 
more sensors than its predecessors, in addition to 
geofencing support and a furnace monitor. If you Ô¨Ånd this 
version a bit too pricey, Nest also offers the Thermostat E, 
which has most of the same smart features for $80 less.icey.
Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance A19 Starter Kit
$199.99
L l l l m
Want complete wireless supremacy over the lights in your 
home? The Philips Hue line delivers with bulbs that let you 
control not only the intensity of the light but also 
the color. It can get pricey, to be sure, but the 
Hue ecosystem has been around long enough 
that it works with just about every other 
system out there, from Alexa to IFTTT to Siri. 
Not interested in colorful lights but still want that 
incredible granular control over an all-white bulb? Philips offers the Hue 
White for $14.95‚Äîalmost a bargain price, at least for smart bulbs.
Anova Culinary Precision Cooker Wi-Fi
$199.99
L l l l m
If you‚Äôre interested in sous vide cooking‚Äîin which food sealed in plastic is 
immersed in a hot bath to cook to perfection‚Äîyou need an immersion circulator to 
get started. The Anova Culinary Precision Cooker uses Wi-Fi connectivity so you 
control it from anywhere, even when you‚Äôre not home. A large dial lets you set the 
desired temperature to within a tenth of a degree, a display shows the set and 
current water temperature, and an app keeps you notiÔ¨Åed of the cooking process 
every step of the way. It makes cooking sous vide as simple as can be.

Eufy RoboVac 11c
$219.99
L l l l m
Robot vacuums are a luxury, smartphone-connected 
models even more so. The Eufy RoboVac 11 stands out as a 
relatively affordable option, though it doesn‚Äôt offer 
anything in the realm of connectivity. But for $70 more, the 
Eufy RoboVac 11c adds Wi-Fi for app control, Amazon Alexa 
compatibility, and better scheduling options. It still lacks 
some of the more advanced features you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd in pricier 
models, but as far as value goes, the RoboVac 11c can‚Äôt be beat.
QardioBase Smart Scale
$129.99
L l l l h
Using technology at home to make you healthier makes good 
sense. For tracking fat, BMI, water, muscle mass, bone 
composition, and even pregnancy, look no further than the 
QardioBase Smart Scale. It shares the info it reads with a 
smartphone app, where you can also track your blood 
pressure and heart rate with the excellent QardioArm, an 
at-home blood pressure cuff. And its design is a standout.
Polaris 9650iQ
$1,499.00
L l l l h
When we Ô¨Årst tested robotic pool cleaners, the Polaris 9550 
Sport took top honors thanks to its superb cleaning 
performance, easy-to-clean debris 
canister, and multiple programming 
options. The new Polaris 9650iQ 
Sport brings more of the same, 
only this time it offers Wi-Fi 
connectivity and a useful mobile 
app that lets you control the 
cleaner from your smartphone.

modern business laptop built on the class-

touches of ThinkPads past, including a non-chiclet 
keyboard, a choice of three TrackPoint caps, and red,

THINKPAD THROUGH THE YEARS
Lenovo (formerly IBM) includes a short book about the 
history of ThinkPad line in the system‚Äôs packaging. The

ThinkPad laptops introduced in 1992. While the new 
ThinkPads are thinner and much lighter, the family 
resemblance remains, from the soft-touch black 
exterior to the red accent from the TrackPoint cap in 
the center of the comfy keyboard.
PC Magazine reviewed the ThinkPad 700c in the 
December 22, 1992 issue, and we called the $4,350

486SLC processor, 8MB of RAM, and a 120MB hard 
drive. This was a 10.4-inch color laptop that weighed 
7.6 pounds and lasted two to three hours on battery 
power. We‚Äôve certainly come a long way since then.
DESIGN AND AESTHETICS
The 25th anniversary edition‚Äôs chassis matches that of 
the ThinkPad T470 in both physical dimensions, at 0.79

pounds). The retro touches start on the top lid, with 
multicolored letters (red, blue, and green) on the 
ThinkPad logo, and continue when you open the lid and 
expose the old-school non-chiclet keyboard with its 
signature blue Enter key. It looks very similar to the 
keyboard on the 2011 ThinkPad T420s, but the feel of 
the key strokes and the switches underneath are more 
modern and as sturdy as today‚Äôs laptops. Also, the one-
piece touchpad is wide like the one on the T470, not 
narrow like the T420‚Äôs. 
Like the recent 
Thinkpad T470, this 
model has a full set of 
ports, including 
Ethernet, HDMI, 
USB-C/Thunderbolt 
3, and USB 3.0.

While you read about the ThinkPad‚Äôs past, you can relive some of that 
experience with an included set of three TrackPoint caps. Lenovo includes the 
mushroom-shaped (Soft Dome) cap that comes with every current ThinkPad 
but also a convex cup-shaped one (the Soft Rim), and two eraser-shaped 
(Classic Dome) caps, in case you want the tactile experience from the late 1990s 
to mid-2000s. All three types of caps work well, though I‚Äôm partial to the Soft 
Rim cap. Folks raised on touchpads likely won‚Äôt care, but pointing-stick comfort 
was an important differentiator before touch screens, touchpads, and 
multitouch support for both became commonplace.

Thunderbolt 3 port for SSDs or 4k monitors. You can also use the port with a 
USB-C charger or Thunderbolt 3 docking station. Also on the left is a traditional

and two more USB 3.0 ports. The wide selection

processor too, but includes only 8GB of RAM and a 
256GB SSD for about the same price ($1,849).
GOOD BATTERY LIFE, DISCRETE GRAPHICS
Back in the day, many ThinkPads came with discrete 
graphics. Integrated graphics performance was subpar 
in the early part of this century and barely existent in 
the 1990s. Most modern ThinkPads (and business PCs 
in general) eschew discrete graphics to save money and 
curtail power usage, but, the ThinkPad 25 comes with 
Nvidia GeForce 940MX discrete graphics. On our 3D 
testing, it was the only business PC able to produce

frames per second) and Valley (48fps) tests at medium 
quality settings. Predictably, frame rates dropped at 
Ultra quality settings, but they were still tops in this 
group. The system also topped the 3DMark Cloud Gate 
and Fire Strike Extreme tests. You should be able to 
easily play Minecraft and Diablo III during work breaks, 
but newer games such as Destiny 2 will be a bit beyond 
the ThinkPad 25‚Äôs capabilities.
The 
anniversary 
edition doesn‚Äôt 
go overboard 
with the 
nostalgia and 
include a 
Ô¨Çoppy or 
optical drive.

Thanks to its Core i7 processor, this ThinkPad made short work of the PCMark

EliteBook 1040 G3, the ThinkPad T470, and the Toshiba Tecra X40-D.
Battery life was good at 11 hours 48 minutes on our rundown test. We don‚Äôt say 
very good because, though it lasted this long on its included slim removable 
battery and built-in secondary battery, the ThinkPad T470 managed 17:39 using 
a combination of its internal battery and an extended removable battery. The 
system lasted 5 hours, 34 minutes on the internal battery alone, a safety net that 
gives the ThinkPad the ability to hot-swap the removable battery for a fresh one. 
A SOLID LAPTOP WITH A SIDE OF NOSTALGIA
A quarter century is a long time: In that span, many PC makers have started up, 
and countless others have shuttered. But the ThinkPad brand has remained 
QHDUWKHWRSRIWKHFKDUWVDQGKDVLQ√ÄXHQFHGWKH¬≥PXVWKDYH¬¥IHDWXUHVDQG
laptop design. The top PC makers still put pointing-stick controllers on their 
mainstream business laptops to this day because so many businesses bought 
ThinkPads in the 1990s and the 2000s. Overall, the Lenovo ThinkPad 25 
Anniversary Edition provides a nice walk down memory lane but is perfectly

The original HP Spectre x360 was a hit when 
it debuted back in 2015, and we liked the 2016 
model even more. It‚Äôs back again this year,

Spectre x360 13 (starts at $1,199, $1,599 as tested) 
packs USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, plenty of fast SSD 
storage, and a chic new color scheme. Given the 
upgrades to what was already our top choice for high-
end convertible laptops, the 2017 model is an easy

GHOST IN THE SHELL
Retaining the slim shape of its predecessor, the new 
Spectre x360 13 adopts the stylish aesthetic of the non-
convertible HP Spectre 13. On our test unit, this means 
a very modern anodized aluminum body with a steel-
gray-and-copper color scheme. The copper trims the 
edges of the system and is used as an accent in several 
places. HP uses the same design approach with the 15-
inch Spectre x360 that we tested earlier this year, and it 
looks really sharp in both cases. HP offers two less

measured 0.63 by 12.79 by 8.6 inches (HWD) and 
weighed 3.26 pounds, the 2016 model was 0.5 by 12 by 
8.6 inches and 2.8 pounds, and this year‚Äôs version is 
minimally slighter at 0.5 by 12 by 8.5 inches and 2.8 
pounds. This compares well with the Lenovo Yoga 910

CONVERTIBILITY PLUS
This is where the Spectre x360 separates itself from the Spectre 13. The laptop 
is able to fully transform into a Windows 10 tablet thanks to its hinge. Some 
systems are a bit too big, thick, or unwieldy to be used as in Tablet mode (the 
Samsung Notebook 7 Spin comes to mind), but since the x360 is so thin and 
small, it feels natural to hold it that way. This makes it easier to carry around in 
one hand, good for quickly showing off a design to a colleague nearby, or

into Tent or Display mode to show off the screen on a desk or table to a 
gathered group, though the 13-inch screen is a bit too small to see when you‚Äôre 
far away.
I brought the Spectre x360 on multiple trips, and I can say it‚Äôs very well suited 
WRSODQHWUDYHO:LWKLWVZHLJKWDQGWKLFNQHVVLW¬øWVLQWRDFDUU\RQRUXQGHU
seat bag, and its convertibility is perfect for an airplane tray. My preferred 
method is rotating the keyboard face down on the tray with the screen pointed 
out toward me from the front, since I can view it at a good angle without it 
butting up against the seat back in front of me. If you think you can get away 
without the convertibility, some even slimmer and lighter options include the

when you grip the back-side of the laptop in Tablet mode. Despite the thin 
build, the keys feel good to type on, offering more travel than, say, the Razer 
Blade Stealth‚Äôs keyboard, which feels a bit shallow. The keyboard offers 
satisfying feedback, as did last year‚Äôs model, but the new color scheme avoids 
the previous gray-on-gray keycap lettering issue, which made it hard to read in 
some instances. The keys are also backlit with white lighting, and you can toggle 
the lights on or off as needed.

The touchpad tracks very smoothly, and though it‚Äôs not too tall because of 
limited space, it‚Äôs nice and wide and still feels roomy. The Bang & Olufsen 
speakers provide admirable volume and sound quality, particularly given the 
laptop‚Äôs size. It‚Äôs not a home-theater setup, of course, but you can comfortably 
play video or music and hear it across the room with little to no distortion at 
maximum volume.

on a display this size, but it‚Äôs a pretty drastic difference in clarity when 
compared with a 1080p screen of similar size. The resolution adds to the

resolution. And you get extra space to view and edit full HD videos with room 
for for toolbars and editing windows. 
You don‚Äôt get a ton of connectivity options given the X360‚Äôs size, but the 
essentials are covered. The left panel holds the Power button, a USB 2.0 port, 
and the headphone jack, while the right side has the Volume rocker and two 
USB-C ports, each with Thunderbolt 3 and capable of charging the laptop. 
There‚Äôs no base video ports such as HDMI or DisplayPort, but with adapters for 
the USB-C ports, you can connect any display you‚Äôd like. One more USB 3.0 
port would have been useful so you could connect an additional peripheral, but 
again, an adapter in the USB-C port should have you covered. At the same time, 
including any USB 3.0 ports at all is appreciated, given some of the recent 
super-thin laptops that limit you to USB-C only, like the latest Apple MacBook.
The hinges allow the 
x360 to transform 
into tablet mode, 
with the keyboard 
folding back behind 
the screen.

For storage, there‚Äôs a 512GB SSD on board, which 
means very speedy boot and load times. All three

version offer 512GB capacities, while the least expensive 
model has 256GB. The same holds true for memory: 
The two more expensive versions include 16GB of RAM 
but the entry-level unit gives you 8GB. For wireless 
connectivity, the Spectre x360 uses dual-band 802.11ac

SPECTRAL SPEED
Despite its small size, the x360 is quite fast. The 2.7GHz 
Core i7-7500U processor, SSD, and 16GB of memory 
make for snappy load times across the board. The 
PCMark 8 Work Conventional test shows a score 
slightly low than similar competition, mainly because

negligible in day-to-day work. The multimedia scores 
back up those claims, showing fast times that compare 
favorably with the competition. Since the processor 
(and by extension, the integrated graphics) is the same 
as in last year‚Äôs Spectre x360 13, the performance

screen adds extra strain.
Given the lack of discrete graphics, the x360 13 doesn‚Äôt 
have much in the way of 3D power or gaming chops. 
You could get away with some Low- or Medium-setting 
games at a low resolution, but even playing at HD with 
modern titles is out of reach. That‚Äôs not unique to this 
system‚Äîalmost every ultraportable or 2-in-1 packs 
integrated graphics, since the emphasis is on slim and 
light form over gaming prowess. The expensive 
Microsoft Surface Book is an exception, but you‚Äôll have 
to pay a pretty penny for the discrete graphics version.
You can play 
video or music 
and hear it 
across the 
room with 
little to no

The VP2768 consumed 28 watts in testing while set to the Standard ECO mode,

There‚Äôs a lot to like about the ViewSonic VP2768. It‚Äôs a sharp-looking monitor

management tool in addition to being a very rich task-management app. It 
might be overkill for personal use, but it‚Äôs an Editors‚Äô Choice for communication 
and collaboration tools for small businesses.
DESIGN AND FEATURES
Todoist is a very capable task-management tool. One of its selling points is that 
it has apps for so many platforms, from iOS and Android to plug-ins 
for Gmail and Thunderbird. Apps for 
Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile are 
available, too. Within the past year,

Slack, meaning you can send a task to 
your Todoist account from Slack by typing 
in a few simple words of text.
Since Todoist is a cloud-
based service, all your tasks 
and notes from one app 
automatically sync to all the 
other places in which you 
have Todoist installed. I‚Äôve used the 
iPhone app for more than a year, and 
syncing has been reliable, but I have 
often had to force syncs in the 
browser.

To manage and conquer your to-dos, Todoist lets you create projects and add 
tasks to them. Projects can be color-coded to help differentiate them visually. 
7DVNVFDQKDYHVXEWDVNVDVZHOODVGXHGDWHVUHPLQGHUV√ÄDJVQRWLQJWKHWDVNV¬∂
urgency, and more.
Todoist supports natural language inputs, so if you want a task to be recurring 
‚Äúevery two weeks‚Äù or ‚Äúevery Friday,‚Äù typing those words into your task title 
makes it happen. Other shortcuts include using # and @ symbols to assign a 
task to a particular project or add tags.
The desktop and Web versions also have manual options for entering recurring 
tasks that some people prefer to natural language entry for making sure they 
don‚Äôt introduce errors. For example, ‚Äútoday and every Friday‚Äù turned out to be 
invalid in my testing, although ‚Äúevery Friday‚Äù or ‚Äúev Friday‚Äù did the trick. I‚Äôd 
rather have the ability to choose my options precisely from a set of selections. In 
the mobile app, there is no way to do that. You can, however, add a time to your 
due date, down to the precise minute.
In the Todoist mobile apps, quick action buttons appear when you swipe on any 
task. These buttons let you change the task to be due today, tomorrow, next 
week, in a month, or to any date you choose.
When you invite collaborators to access your tasks and projects, they‚Äôll have to 
sign up for a Todoist account, but they don‚Äôt need to upgrade to Premium. With 
collaborators, you can assign tasks to other people, or they might assign tasks to

however, Todoist has plenty to keep 
you busy.
I love that Todoist keeps automatic 
backups of your data. When I explored 
this section, I found eight backups with 
time and date stamps going back a few 
minutes to about a week. I also appreciate that

GOOD PRODUCTIVITY KARMA
Todoist has a unique feature called Karma that I like 
very much. It‚Äôs a small report showing your productivity 
KRZPDQ\WDVNV\RXFURVVHGRIIWKLVZHHNEDVHGRQ
your color-coded projects. Karma gives me a clear 
indication of whether I‚Äôm spending my time working on 
the projects that are my priority. Every now and again, I 
notice my Karma report shows I‚Äôve been working too 
much on projects that are not important rather than 
focusing my time and energy on those that should be 
priorities. It also draws your attention to which days of 
the week you tend to get the most done. The Karma 
report is limited to Premium users.
No other to-do list app I‚Äôve seen has anything like the 
Karma report. It‚Äôs similar to a very lightweight version 
of a reporting tool you might see in a project 
management app. If it sounds useful, you should 
GH¬øQLWHO\FKHFNRXW5HVFXH7LPHZKLFKLVRQHRIP\
favorite productivity tools for monitoring time usage in 
this same way. If you like the productivity tracking in 
Todoist, you‚Äôll probably also like RescueTime.
TODOIST, OR NOT TODOIST?
The Premium version of Todoist is one of the most 
feature-rich to-do apps I‚Äôve used. It has a simple and 
functional interface, support for collaboration, and apps 
for many platforms so that you can get to your to-do list 
no matter where you are. For all those reasons, Todoist 
Premium is an Editors‚Äô Choice for to-do list apps.

complete with transitions, effects, and titles. It handles 
the standard trimming, joining, and overlaying of clips 
and effects with aplomb. PowerDirector‚Äôs fast, powerful

PRICING AND INSTALLATION
PowerDirector runs on Windows 7 through Windows 
10, with 64-bit versions recommended. You can try out 
the software with a 30-day downloadable trial version 
that adds brand watermarks and doesn‚Äôt support 4K. 
Two editions of the standalone video editor are

CyberLink‚Äôs ColorDirector, AudioDirector, and 
3KRWR'LUHFWRULQWKH'LUHFWRU6XLWHEXQGOH
The higher-end options add loads of third-party special 
effects from the likes of BorixFX, NewBlue, and 
proDAD. You can also get the complete suite for a 
subscription at $49.99 for three months or $99.99 per 
year. The pricing is competitive with that of Premiere 
Elements‚Äô $99.99, Corel VideoStudio‚Äôs $99.99, and our

installer no longer tries to add extra unrelated apps 
alongside the video editor, which makes me happy.
INTERFACE
The program‚Äôs user interface is about as clear and 
simple as a program with such a vast number of options 
can be, but it can still get overwhelming when you‚Äôre 
GHHSLQWKHZHHGVRI¬øQHWXQLQJYLGHRRUDXGLRHIIHFWV
You start off in a Welcome screen offering big button 
options of Timeline Mode, Storyboard Mode, and 
Slideshow Creator. Two choices below those include 
Auto Mode and 360 Editor‚Äîall these modes are self-
explanatory.

CONS No trimming in

Doesn‚Äôt output 
360-degree projects

If you don‚Äôt need or want all these choices every time 
you start the program, the simple Always Enter 
Timeline Mode checkbox is for you. On this welcome 
screen, you can also choose your video project‚Äôs aspect 
ratio‚Äî16:9, 4:3, and (new for this version) 9:16, a tall 
mode, since some people never seem to learn to hold 
their phones sideways for videos.
The PowerDirector editing interface maintains the 
traditional source and preview split panels on the top, 
with your track timeline along the whole width of the 
bottom of the screen. The storyboard view is more than 
just clip thumbnails. You can drag transitions between 
clips, apply effects, and add audio clips without 
switching to timeline view. I also like the buttons at the 
top for showing just video, just photos, or just audio in 
the source panel.
Four mode choices line up at the top: Capture, Edit, 
Produce, and Create Disc. The timeline is easy to 
customize and navigate, with a button for adding tracks. 
You‚Äôre allowed up to 100. Vegas Movie Studio limits you 
WRZKLFKLVDOUHDG\SUREDEO\PRUHWKDQPRVWSHRSOH
need, though not enough for high-end projects. 
The program‚Äôs 
user interface 
is about as 
clear and 
simple as a 
program with 
such a vast 
number of 
options can be.

By default, you get three pairs of video and audio tracks with Cyberlink, as well 
as effects, title, voice, and music tracks. You can lock, disable/enable view, or 
rename tracks from the left track-info area, and you can even use drag and drop 
to move them up and down on the timeline. Zooming the timeline in and out is 
also a snap, either with Ctrl-Mouse wheel or a slider control.
BASIC VIDEO EDITING
As with most nonlinear video editing software, you join and trim clips on the 
timeline. CyberLink has changed the default timeline behavior a bit with this 
release: When you drag a clip onto the timeline, you‚Äôre likely to overlap with the 
H[LVWLQJFOLSWRWKHOHIWLQVWHDGRIWKHFOLS¬øUPO\VQDSSLQJQH[WWRDQH[LVWLQJ

and Move All Clips, Crossfade, and Replace. When you use the Insert button 
that appears below the source panel when you select a clip, you can get your clip 
lined up without any fuss.
The Trim tool (opened with a scissors icon) allows precise control down to the 
individual frame with two sliders, and the multi-trim tool lets you mark several 
In and Out points on your clip‚Äîa useful tool for cutting out the chaff. Some 
professional video editors I know lament, however, that you can‚Äôt do a rough 
trim on a clip before dragging it down into PowerDirector‚Äôs project timeline, as 
you can in Final Cut Pro X.
The Trim tool in 
PowerDirector is 
powerful, letting you 
remove sections 
from the middle of a 
long clip.

You use PowerDirector‚Äôs unique and intuitive selection 
cursor to split video and delete sections. Fix/Enhance 
options also include video denoise, audio denoise, and 
enhancements to punch up color and sharpness. 
3RZHU'LUHFWRUDOVRPDNHVLWHDV\WR¬ø[OLJKWLQJDQG
color. You can independently adjust the brightness, 
contrast, hue, saturation, sharpness, and white balance. 
New for Version 16 is color matching‚Äîimportant for 
movies shot at different angles with different equipment 
and lighting.
The new Color Match option appears when you have 
two clips selected, and it‚Äôs a simple matter of scrubbing 
to the frame in each that you want to match. It did a 
good job in my tests with scenery and d√©cor, but it could 
EHQH¬øWIURPIDFHGHWHFWLRQDVLWGLGQ¬∂WPDWFKVNLQWRQHV
between clips very well. The new support for CLUTs, or 
color lookup tables, can give your movie a uniform look, 
by applying a color mood like those you see in the 
cinema‚Äîfor example, the dark-blue look of the Batman 
movies. PowerDirector supports a healthy number of 
¬øOHIRUPDWVIRUWKLVLQFOXGLQJ'/&63&8%(0'
MGA, RV3DLUT, and VF. Unfortunately, the program 
doesn‚Äôt give you much support in actually locating 
CLUTs‚Äîyou‚Äôre pretty much on your own. Pinnacle 
Studio, the only other consumer editor I know of with 
CLUT support, starts you out with a good selection of 
the effects, by comparison.
Fix/Enhance 
options 
include video 
denoise, audio 
denoise, and 
enhancements 
to punch up 
color and 
sharpness. 

ASSISTED MOVIE MAKING
One of the best things to come to home video editors in recent years was 
pioneered by Apple with the Trailers feature of the Mac‚Äôs included iMovie app. 
Adobe recently added a similar tool, Premiere Elements‚Äô Video Story feature. 
:LWKHLWKHURIWKHVH\RX¬øOOWHPSODWHVLQZLWKYLGHRDQGSKRWRFRQWHQWWKDW
meets the needs of a spot in the production, such as Group shot, close-up, or 
Action shot. These are elaborated with transitions and background music that 
match your chosen theme. PowerDirector has a similar tool, Express Project, 
which you can enter directly from the program startup panel.
Express Project joins another similar tool, the Magic Movie Wizard, which takes 
you through importing source content, adjusting that content, previewing, and 
producing. You get four Styles to choose from, including Memory Field, 
2ULJLQDO)DVW0RWLRQDQG6ORZ0RWLRQEXW\RXFDQGRZQORDGPRUHIURP
DirectorZone.com, Cyberlink‚Äôs Web resource site. Unlike the iMovie tool, 
PowerDirector requires you to add your own background music‚Äîthere are no 
canned scores in the wizard or for Express Projects.
Nine Express Projects are available for download, including Action, Extreme, 
Round the World, and Wedding. An Express Project requires only two steps: 
'UDJJLQJDQ2SHQLQJ0LGGOHDQG(QGLQJRQWRWKHWLPHOLQHDQG¬øOOLQJWKH
resulting clip tracks with your media. It‚Äôs nowhere near as intuitive or clear as 
Apple iTunes‚Äô Trailers feature or Adobe Premiere Elements‚Äô Video Story feature. 
But it does offer guidance in crafting a digital movie, it is actually more 
customizable, and the results look pretty cool.
The Magic Movie 
Wizard tool takes you 
through importing 
source content, 
adjusting that 
content, previewing, 
and producing. You‚Äôll 
need to add your own 
background music; 
PowerDirector offers 
no canned scores.

New for Version 16 is the Video Collage Designer. This 
is similar to a tool that appeared in the last version of 
Adobe Premiere Elements. Accessed from the Plug-ins 
button, the Video Collage Designer shows templates 
with your clips on the side. You simply drag and drop 
the latter into the former to get a nifty animated 
picture-in-picture. 
WORKING WITH 360-DEGREE FOOTAGE
When you add a 360-degree clip to your project, 
PowerDirector pops up a dialog box asking whether you

latter, the View Designer window opens, which let you 
choose the resulting movie‚Äôs point of view. You can 
move the angle around in this window‚Äôs preview in 
three axes (x, y, and z) with the mouse pointer.
Clicking on up, down, left, and right arrows alters your 
point of view, and clicking the center of the arrow 
control snaps the view to straight on. You can zoom the 
view, and very usefully, use keyframes to switch from 
one viewpoint to another. That last option can take 
advantage of the Ease In option, which makes the 
motion more naturally accelerate and decelerate, rather 
than happening mechanically.
Nine Express 
Projects are 
available for 
download, 
including 
Action, 
Extreme, Round 
the World, and 
Wedding.

produced by the Little Planet dropdown in the View 
Designer. This takes 360-degree content and realigns it 
so that the ground is shaped like a ball that any people 
in the video are walking around. Drag on the image 
downward and you can create the opposite type of 
world, in which the inhabitants are inside of a sphere. 
Also new for 360 videos are stabilization and, 
remarkably, motion tracking. CyberLink has really 
SXVKHGWKHHQYHORSHZLWKWKHVH¬øUVWPRYHUIHDWXUHV
Unfortunately, I could not get good stabilization results 
in footage from my Samsung Gear 360, but when I tried 
sample shaky footage from CyberLink‚Äôs Steven Lien, the 
feature worked well.

footage, except the selection box changes shape to 
UH√ÄHFWLWVSRVLWLRQLQ'VSDFH,W¬∂VDVLPSOHWKUHHVWHS
process: You box the object you want to track, run the 
tracker, and then attach text or graphics to follow it. 
And it works better than any motion tracking I‚Äôve tested 
to date. The tracker displayed a circle centering on and 
a box around the colleagues head I was tracking, and it 
locked on perfectly. 
In the past these tools have tended to lose the tracked 
object, being distracted by background objects. It even 
kept up with the trackee when he walked behind a glass 
door. That was impressive!
For projects that you intend to output in 360-degree 
format, you can still use the basic trimming, splitting, 
and joining editing tools, but there are a bunch of 
PowerDirector features you cannot use: Magic Movie, 
video cropping (think about it), and content-aware 
editing. You also cannot successfully mix non-360 
content into a 360 project.
The Little 
Planet 
dropdown takes 
360-degree 
content and 
realigns it so 
that the ground 
is shaped like 
a ball.

Adding titles and transitions is still possible, as is 
making color corrections and time speedups and 
slowdowns. The program now offers 11 360-degree title 
RSWLRQVLQFOXGLQJVRPHZLWK√Ä\LQDQLPDWLRQV<RXFDQ
also change up the fonts with over 100 choices and 
apply effects such as stroke and drop shadow. These 
360 titles stay in place as the viewer moves around 
rather than just statically remaining over the image. But 
you can also move them around, change transparency, 
and scale, all using keyframes‚Äîpretty cool.
Once you‚Äôve edited the content to taste, you output to 
+03IRUPDWRU\RXFDQXSORDGGLUHFWO\WR
Facebook, YouTube, and now, Vimeo. The exporter lets 
you choose a privacy level and resolution, including 4K

standard, non-360 content, however.
The program now 
offers 11 360-degree 
title options, 
including some with 
Ô¨Çy-in animations.

ACTION CAMERA TOOLS
PowerDirector can, of course, import and edit footage from GoPro cameras as 
well as from other action cameras from the likes of Sony, Kodak, and Ion. But 
the dedicated Action Camera Center under the Tools menu item appears when 
\RXVHOHFWDFOLS7KLVRIIHUVHIIHFWVVXFKDVFDPHUDSUR¬øOHEDVHGFRUUHFWLRQVIRU

favored by action cam users, such as freeze-frame and time-shifts like 
slowdowns, speedups, and replays.
7KH¬øVKH\H¬ø[KDVDQDGYDQWDJHRYHU
GoPro‚Äôs own video editor in that it cuts 
off less of the edge of the screen, and in 
my test shot, it distorted faces less than 
the GoPro software. Stabilization isn‚Äôt 
an option in the stock GoPro software, 
and CyberLink offers enhanced 
VWDELOL]DWLRQDQGWKHDELOLW\WR¬ø[
camera rotation for a smoother look. 
The enhanced stabilization (which takes much longer) did a nice job of 
smoothing out bumpy shots, but I still occasionally saw some warping‚Äîa 
common artifact of stabilization technology.

reverse, and speed effects. You choose how long a piece of the clip the effect 
should be applied to, and from check boxes you can choose Ease In and Ease 
Out options. The tool lets you easily create fun effects that are prized by 
skateboarders, surfers, and other fun lovers.
Another tangentially action-cam-related capability is the ability to import and 
HGLWFOLSVVKRWDWDKLJKIUDPHUDWHVXFKDVISVDQGISV,LPSRUWHGD
sample of the latter from an iPhone 6, and when I dragged it into my timeline, I 
got a warning box telling me the frame rate differed from that of my project, but 
Settings offered only a maximum of 60fps for a project. A CyberLink contact 
informed me that the limit applied only to the timeline view and assured me

test clip turned a hand clap into a terrifying bass thump.

MOTION TRACKING
Motion tracking lets an object, text, or effect follow around something moving 
in your video. You pick the Motion Tracker choice from the same Tools menu as 
the Action Camera, after selecting a clip in the timeline. The tool makes tracking 
an object and adding a title, effect, or even another media clip a simple three-
step process. You start by positioning a target box on the object you want 
tracked, then press the Track button, which runs through the video while 
following your boxed object. And then you choose what you want to follow the 
tracked object.
$VPHQWLRQHGDERYHWKHGHJUHHWUDFNHUZRUNHGH[WUHPHO\ZHOOEXWWKH'

realigning the box, and starting tracking again.
For attaching text to motion-tracked objects in PowerDirector, you can easily 
attach a mosaic, spotlight, or blur effect, and you get a good choice of many 
fonts, colors, and sizes. You can even rotate the text with a handle. One thing I‚Äôd 
like to be able to add, however, is a speech bubble, something offered by Adobe 
and Corel.
CONTENT-AWARE AND MULTICAM EDITING
PowerDirector can analyze your clip for people, zooming, panning, speech, 
motion, and shaky video. This enables you to select or reject areas of interest or 
boringness. Premiere Elements has a tool that lets you manually pick your 
favorite moments, but it‚Äôs not automated like PowerDirector‚Äôs. The Edit using 
Content Aware Editing right-click choice processes a clip, and then it shows a 
dialog with tracks for each of the detected events, such as Zoom, Pan, Faces, 
Speech, Shaky Video, and more. Clicking on any of the detected clip segments 
lets you easily select or deselect that portion of the clip for use in your project. 
Note that this feature doesn‚Äôt work with 360-degree content.
:LWKVRPDQ\SHRSOHVKRRWLQJHYHQWVVLPXOWDQHRXVO\ZLWKWKHLU+'FDPHUD
phones, multicam is no longer just for professionals. PowerDirector allows up 
to 100 multicam tracks, but what this really means is that you can sync that 
many tracks by audio in the main timeline. The actual multicam-switching 
interface still just has four video sources.

For synchronization, you get a choice of Audio Analysis 
(the best choice for amateurs), Manual, Timecodes, File 
Created Time, and Markers on Clips. When I used 
Audio Analysis, my two clips synced perfectly. The 
program lets you choose which track‚Äôs audio should be 
XVHGRU\RXFDQLPSRUWDVHSDUDWHDXGLRWUDFN+LWWLQJ
Record played all angles synchronized, letting me 
switch among them. The tool creates sub-clips labeled 1 
to 4 for the camera angles, with adjustable split points.
When you‚Äôre done cutting, the clip sequence appears on 
the regular timeline. Subclips are in separate tracks, but 
you can‚Äôt adjust the cut points there without losing 
footage and messing up the synchronization. The 
multicam designer itself lets you adjust these. 
Thankfully, you can also reopen a multicam sequence in 
the designer after you‚Äôve sent it to the timeline. In all, 
it‚Äôs a well-done and powerful tool.
NEAR-PRO VIDEO EDITING
If you‚Äôre into keyframe editing (which allows precise 
control over when effects begin and end based on exact 
frames you choose) PowerDirector is there for you. It 
offers picture-in-picture (PiP), overlays, motion, 
cropping, and time codes. All effects and adjustments 
can be pegged to keyframes. You get over 100 
transitions and special effects to choose from, including 
ten from NewBlue. And the app lets you install third-
party effect plug-ins from Pixelan and ProDAD.
Transitions are easy to add, and the program can decide 
what material before and after to use when you drop 
this kind of effect to a join line between clips. A search 
ER[OHWV\RX¬øQGDVSHFL¬øFW\SHOLNH3DJH&XUO$QG\RX
can even create custom transitions using your images 
with the Alpha set of transitions, which rely on masking 
and transparency. 
With so many 
people 
shooting 
events with 
their HD 
camera phones, 
multicam is no 
longer just for 
professionals. 

PowerDirector‚Äôs chroma-key tool lets you 
shoot someone with a single-color 
background, usually green, and create the 
effect of him or her being in an exotic scene 
by choosing a different background. 
Controls for tolerance of saturation, 
luminance, and edge sharpness let you 
create more-precise masks, and even in the 
default mode, I noticed none of the green 
halo I sometimes see around test subjects in 
other programs.
A new Mask Designer lets you add transparency to mask objects (including your 
own images) and text. As with just about every effect, you can use keyframes to 
gradually ease in and out of these mask effects.

Unlike Premiere Elements, PowerDirector can import, edit, display, and

displaying it. Once you‚Äôve got your 3D content in the program, you can add 3D 
transitions, particles, and titles.

AUDIO
Audio tracks in the timeline by default show waveform 
lines, and you can turn volume up and down by 
grabbing and dragging them. The Audio Room, a simple 
track-volume mixer, features Normalize buttons for 
each track to even out clip sound levels. It‚Äôs also easy to 
create voiceovers with the Voice-Over Recording Room. 
CyberLink‚Äôs WaveEditor is a separate included app that 
lets you correct distortion, equalize, generate reverb, 
and apply a few special effects. It also includes VST 
plug-in support for third-party effects.
The standard video editor also includes beat detection, 
which puts markers on the timeline at music beats so 
you can synchronize clip action. But for really advanced 
mixing, recording, syncing, cleaning, and restoration, 
there‚Äôs AudioDirector (included with the Ultimate Suite 
edition). With this separate app, you can easily apply

them in PowerDirector. New for Version 16 is automatic 
ducking, which automatically lowers background audio 
during dialog on another track. It didn‚Äôt do much for a 
loud concert video on top of an interview but worked 
better with a standard background track.

PERFORMANCE
CyberLink‚Äôs investment in 64-bit optimizations and graphics hardware 
acceleration has paid off. Other speed-boosters include OpenCL (Open 
Computing Language) support and intelligent SVRT, which determines how 
your clips should be rendered for the best-quality output and fastest editing. In 
my latest round of performance testing, the program remains the fastest among 
its peers.
I tested rendering time by creating a movie consisting of four clips of mixed 
types (some 1080p, some SD, and some 4K) with a standard set of transitions

PowerDirector is certainly among the leaders. Its render speed with OpenCL 
acceleration enabled is nothing short of astonishing. During rendering, 
PowerDirector also shows you the time elapsed, time remaining, and what 
frame in the movie you‚Äôre at during the process.
REAL POWER FOR YOUR VIDEO EDITS
PowerDirector continues to lead the way in consumer video-editing software. 
There‚Äôs more in this powerful, full-featured package than I have room to 
discuss‚Äîslideshows, disc menus, and animated object design tools, to name 
just a few. Its wealth of powerful tools would be enough to give it a strong 
recommendation, but the speed with which PowerDirector handles editing and 
rendering digital movies really gives it the upper hand in the face of many 
competing products. CyberLink PowerDirector 16 Ultimate remains PCMag‚Äôs 
Editors‚Äô Choice for enthusiast-level video-editing software, along with Corel 
VideoStudio and, for Mac users, Apple Final Cut Pro X.

USE THE SIGNAL APP (available on iOS and Android): It can send encrypted 
messages and make calls when both parties are connected to the internet. 
Though it has had some competition from WhatsApp and Viber, its reputation 
for security has made it indispensable to many, particularly those who live 
under governments that censor and monitor citizens (not to mention those who 
use it and other chat apps for more nefarious purposes).
BE YOUR OWN HOTSPOT: Almost all laptops and phones make it easy to 
become a hotspot for yourself and others. In Windows 10 devices, go to Settings 
> Network & Internet > Mobile Hotspot so you can pick the type of internet 
connection used and get the name of the network (or change it), as well as the 
network password you‚Äôll need for access (you can change it‚Äîit has to have at 
least eight characters). On macOS devices, go to Apple Menu > System

you can always throw the phone into a passing truck and lead whoever might be

router uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to assign an IP address to every 
device on your home network, and those are then visible only on that network. 
Direct attacks can sometimes be stopped dead right there. Also, you need the 
router for sharing the internet connection and Wi-Fi.
ANONYMOUS EMAIL: It‚Äôs essential for your email to go unnoticed if you want 
to avoid spam (or surveillance). The problem is that email simply wasn‚Äôt built 
with security in mind. But some secure email services use encryption to 
scramble what you send and require the recipient to have a password that 
decrypts your message. Of Webmail services that handle encrypted messages, 
ProtonMail is considered the top of the heap. With a data center in privacy-
minded Switzerland, the service has a free tier and charges 4 euros a month for 
the full service. It keeps all your email info secure from search and has a 
connection directly through the Tor network (once you set it up).

PREP FOR EMERGENCY SOS: Emergency SOS does two things: It initiates a 
call to 911 without you having to open the phone app to dial (you may need to 
specify your local emergency number). It‚Äôll also deactivate Touch ID (and, we‚Äôll 
guess, Face ID in the new iPhone X when it arrives). To turn it on, go to Settings

STOP TALKING TO SIRI‚ÄîJUST TYPE: Before iOS 11, the only way to

feedback as usual. This is also where one turns on ‚ÄúControl with Ring Switch,‚Äù 
so Siri does not speak up if you have the phone ring switch set to mute, which is 
always a good idea. If you set up Type to Siri, then the only way to talk to the 
digital assistant is to say ‚ÄúHey Siri,‚Äù which you set up in Settings > Siri & Search.
DO COOL THINGS WITH LIVE PHOTOS: With iOS 11, the frame rate of Live

AVOID PHISHING SCAMS: Gmail has been successfully used in major phishing

REOPEN CLOSED TABS: Have you ever mistakenly closed a tab? We all have. 
But Chrome is a forgiving browser and makes it possible to get it all back. Just 
right-click on another open tab and select ‚ÄúReopen closed tab‚Äù or press Control-

hen you compare the typical 21st century classroom with that of 
the early 1900s, the differences aren‚Äôt terribly obvious. Teachers 
will be standing in front, giving instructions and sharing notes on a 
modern-day version of the old blackboard‚Äîsay, an overhead projector or a 
shared computer display. Students will be sitting at their desks in the 
classroom or watching via online video-conferencing software. The technology 
has changed: A lot of the tools and processes have been digitized, some of it 
has been automated, and geographical barriers have been removed to some 
extent‚Äîbut the actors and elements have remained much the same.

same power of personalized recommendations wherever the 
student is. Learning opportunities and access should no 
longer be restricted to a certain time or place as they‚Äôve 
typically been in our analog past.‚Äù
The evolution 
of intelligent 
tutoring 
systems can 
eventually 
lead to a 
richer self-
paced learning 
experience.

EDUCATION WILL REMAIN A SOCIAL EXPERIENCE

are causing major disruptions. The reason is that education and learning are 
fundamentally social experiences that are extremely hard‚Äîif not impossible‚Äîto 
automate.

to unpack the black box of learning and enable learners, 
teachers, and parents to track progress across multiple 
subjects, skills, and characteristics‚Äîthis can provide 
vital information to support learners to become more 
effective as learners as well as to help them learn 
knowledge and skills.‚Äù
7KHDXJPHQWDWLRQDQGDVVLVWDQFHWKDW$,SURYLGHVWR
the education and learning process will make teachers 
HYHQPRUHSURGXFWLYHDQGHI¬øFLHQW¬≥7HDFKHUVZLOOEH
able to focus on what they can do best: create excellent 
content, deliver strong lectures, and address the most 
pervasive pain points both in person and remotely, 
individually and in groups,‚Äù says Brinton.
Another social aspect of education is collaboration. 
Students often learn more from working in groups and 
with each other as they do from listening to lectures and 
solving problems at their own pace. ‚ÄúThe goals of 
education include more social interaction, such as 
learning to be a good collaborator or to communicate 
with others,‚Äù says Ritter, the 
product architect from 
Carnegie Learning. ‚ÄúSo a 
challenge in personalizing 
instruction is to balance seeing a 
student as an independent 
learner who can proceed at 
his or her own pace with the 
need to work collaboratively 
with others.‚Äù
AI cannot replace 
teachers, 
because it has 
no self-
awareness or 
metacognitive 
regulation, and it 
also lacks 
empathy.
