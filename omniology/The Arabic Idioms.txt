------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
• What is an idiom?  
 
An idiom is an artistic expression of the language. Usually, the individual meanings of its 
components is different from its literal meaning. By contrast, ordinary language is logical or even 
mathematical (he studied for five years,  .)درس ﻟﻤﺪة ﺧﻤﺲ ﺳﻨﻮاتIdiomatic expressions are colorful, 
dramatic, lively, closer to the way people really feel, and closer to the local culture.  
 
• How the idioms were collected? (pearl diving) 
 
Unlike Arabic proverbs, where there is an existing public interest, such as books, dictionaries and 
lexicons, there were not ready-made sources available for collecting idioms. Therefore, it took 
several years to collect thousands of idioms mainly from two sources. First, live sources such as 
TV, radios programs and  movies and directly from daily interaction. Secondly, written sources, 
such as newspapers, magazines, novels and books. 
 
Why were only the commons idioms chosen? (unusual in Arabic!) 
 
Naturally, the more common the expression is in Syria and the Arab world, the more useful it is, 
particularly to a non-native reader. In contrast, the proverbs listed in lexicons, radio, TV 
newspapers and magazines include a considerable number of archaic proverbs, because these 
are commonly presented for educational purposes to Arabic native speakers who are already 
familiar with common and local proverbs. To simplify the task of the non-native learner of Arabic, 
only about sixteen hundred idioms were chosen (from several thousands). More idioms may be 
added in future editions. 
 
• How the idioms were arranged and classified? 
 
Alphabetical order was chosen. As for the idioms that have more than one common form, they 
were listed under different letters. The first word of the idiom normally determines in what section 
the expression is located. Idiomatic expressions are thus looked up the same as any word is 
looked up in a normal Arabic – English dictionary. The same conventions apply. ( The verb has to 
be in past tense singular, the noun is extracted from any additions such as a preposition or a 
definite article etc.) . 
 
• Why were both spoken and written put together? (a first in Arabic!) 
 
Since the majority of idioms are used interchangeably between both speaking and writing, it 
makes sense to place them in the same section. However, to clarify, each type is marked as 
written only, spoken only, literary etc. Generally, spoken Arabic uses idioms more often than 
written, and therefore, sixty to seventy percent of the idioms are more commonly associated with 
the spoken language. At the same time, within written Arabic itself, there are noticeable 
differences in usage:  news commentary and analysis, novels and society, arts and sports reports 
tend to use more spoken idioms than news or scientific reports and religious writing. In short, the 
more serious, theoretical, abstract and formal the writing is, the more formal the written language 
becomes. 
 
 
• How are the idioms laid out? 
 
First and in the right (Arabic) column, there is the idiom in Arabic script, sometimes with its 
synonyms, if any, and alternative or similar forms. In the middle is the literal word-for-word 
 
4

translation in English. Finally, to the left is found the explanation in terms of the general meaning, 
the best situation when the idiom is used, historical and cultural background interpretation and, if 
it exists, the English equivalent idiom. 
 
• Kinds of synonyms 
 
Synonymous expression are meant to give the same or nearly the same meaning. In some 
cases, the synonym is easier to understand, and in other cases, it is more common. Sometimes, 
the same words can be used in a different order e.g. ﺑﺎﻟﻪ ﻣﺸﻐﻮل- ﻣﺸﻐﻮل ﺑﺎﻟﻪ
 or the same words are 
used in a slightly different form (e.g. verb instead of adjective)  اﻧﺸﻐﻞ ﺑﺎﻟﻲor merely a different 
preposition e.g. ﺑﺎﻟﺴﺮاء واﻟﻀﺮاء- ﻓﻲ اﻟﺴﺮاء واﻟ
ﻀﺮاء
 .
 
• What is the alternative-similar form? 
 
Often, the same or similar expression is used in different parts of the Arab world. The differences 
range from accent, an alternate or added letter ( ,)ق، ذ، ج، ث، كor use with an alternate 
preposition. This is due to the cultural, ethnic, environmental and  dialectical complexities of the 
region. In fact, a relatively minor variation in accent or spelling can make the expression look very 
different to the learner. For example  ﺑﺪك اﻟﺤﻖ وﻻ اﺑﻦ ﻋﻤﻪSyrian, ﻋﺎﻳﺰ ا
ﻟﺤﻖ وﻻ اﺑﻦ ع
ﻣﻪ 
 Egyptian 
and ﺗﺮﻳﺪ اﻟﺤﻖ وﻻ اﺑﻦ ﻋﻤﻪ
 
 Bedouin. 
 
• Why the literal translation? 
 
The advantages of literal translation are numerous.  First, it increases vocabulary by allowing a 
learner to make a direct word for word translation and comparison. Second, it highlights the 
contrast between the direct (original) meaning of the expression and the indirect (idiomatic) 
sense. Third, it opens doors to the moral values and way of thinking of native-speakers. It helps 
to underline cultural factors: what the people consider persuasive, funny or sacred.  
 
Caution: In some cases, a word for word rendering of the Arabic into English is impossible, 
usually because the words simply do not exist in English. 
 
• Several kinds of idioms 
 
There are regular idioms and there are special idioms in terms of structure or meaning. Those of 
special structure are the dialogue expressions, the narrative expressions and the 
rhetorical questions.  
 
Dialogue expressions 
 
Very common in Arabic, these typically require a formulaic response to a question, for example. 
 
Two roles are required, e.g. ﺑﺪك اﻟﺤﻖ وﻻ اﺑﻦ ﻋﻤﻪ
؟
 The listener should reply saying  اﻟﺤﻖor  ًﻃﺒﻌﺎ
  .اﻟﺤﻖ
 
 
Narrative expressions 
 
The narrative expression normally consists of two to four sentences that make a very short story 
which makes a point, e.g. ( ﺑﻘﻮل ﺗﻮر ﺑﻴﻘﻮل اﺣﻠﺒﻪI tell him it’s a bull, he says milk him!  
This means he does not understand what I mean).  
 
 
5

Rhetorical questions 
 
The rhetorical question is a question form but requires no answer. 
 
EXAMPLE 
 
Offensive expressions 
 
As in English and other languages, there are many expressions that are very useful and colorful 
but which cannot be employed in polite company. In this book, a more acceptable, cleaned-up 
version is offered in its place. The fact that a more salacious version is available is duly noted. 
 
• How to use this book 
 
First, it is recommended to read the book thoroughly and carefully, so one gets a good 
understanding of what Arabic idioms are like. It also helps to know how the idioms are listed and 
how to find them or return to them easily.  Idioms are useful for passive understanding 
as well as active usage.
