UNIS’S ANCIENT MEDINA
UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.
Bustling with life for over one thousand
years, it is full of narrow alleys, mosques,
oriental markets and unexpected
courtyards. It also has many mysterious
and colourful doorways beyond which
are ancient palaces and wealthy homes.
The medina is centred on an axis
formed by the Great Mosque and its

many surrounding souks.

Place du
Gouvernement 6
T
HIS BUSY square is full of
government buildings,
fountains, palm trees and
flowers. It is also a popular
meeting place for young
people and serves as a useful
starting point for expeditions
into the heart of the medina
(it is just a short distance from
the Great Mosque).
Place du Gouvernement is
situated in what would once
have been the western limit
of the medina. It is flanked
on the west by the Boulevard
Bab Benat (Tunis’s local
government building stands
on the opposite side of the
avenue), and on the east
and north by the Government
Secretariat and the Ministry of
Religious Affairs.
The Dar el-Bey (see
opposite) stands at its
southern end on the side of
the Sidi Youssef Mosque. This
former bey’s residence has
been renovated several times
and now houses the offices of
Tunisia’s prime minister.
with the main sights and
other points of interest clearly
marked on it. 
The palace was built as a
guest house by a Husaynid
monarch in 1795, on the ruins
of a royal residence dating
from the Muradid period. It
was extensively remodelled in
1876 when it was used by the
Bey of Tunis as a place to
receive important visitors. It
was here that he received
many heads of state from
Germany, England, France
and the Ottoman Empire. 
The bey himself lived
outside Tunis in the Bardo
area at this time. Prior to that,
until the Husaynid period
(18th century), the sultan’s
main residence was the
nearby kasbah. The change
was partly brought about by
the fashion for building
summer residences that
prevailed at the beginning 
of the 19th century.
Souk et-Trouk 3
T
HIS 17TH-CENTURY Turkish
market is situated between
Souk el-Attarine (the scent
market) and Souk el-Berka
(formerly the site of the old
slave market). It contains the
north gateway to the Great
Mosque and also Au Palais
d’Orient – one of Tunis’s
best-known carpet shops and
viewing points. Here, visitors
will also find Café M. Rabet
with its miniature garden (a
kind of verandah) and a more
expensive restaurant on the
first floor (overlooking a
section of the Great Mosque).
This is the place to come to
enjoy some traditional
Tunisian music, a cup of tea
and, for those that want it, a
puff of tobacco through a
chicha (hookah).
The Three
Medersas 2
Rue des Libraires 11, 19 & Rue de la
Medersa 13.
T
HE GREAT MOSQUE is
adjoined by a group of
three medersas. Built by the
Husaynids as residential
Islamic schools in the 18th
century, each of them has a
similar layout, with a
courtyard flanked on three
sides by students’ cells. Used
by students studying the
Koran, the fourth side of the
medersas’ courtyards adjoin
the mosque.
The oldest of them is the
Medersa of the Palm Tree
(1714). Its name derives from
the palm tree that stands at
the centre of the courtyard
surrounded by arcaded
galleries. The arcades, with
their horseshoe arches, have
columns with richly
ornamented capitals. The
Medersa of the Palm Tree
now houses the headquarters
of the organization concerned
with Koranic law.
Bachia, the second in the
group, was built in 1752 by
Ali Pasha. Standing next to
the entrance is a small
fountain with miniature pools
that are always full of water.
The adjacent tourbet
(mausoleum) houses the
Cultural Society. Slimania
also owes its existence to Ali
Pasha, who built it in memory
of his son Suleyman who had
been murdered by his
younger brother.

building in Tunis’s Place

The Great Souk 7
T
HE MEDINA IN
T
Tunis has
more than 20 souks. The
T
major ones are adjacent to the
Great Mosque and together
form one vast, colourful,
animated marketplace. Two
terms, both meaning
“market”, compete with each
other in the Muslim world:
the bazaar (from the Persian)
and the souk (from the
Arabic). For centuries a souk
had a distinct, cohesive
character based on the
traditions of the eastern and
Mediterranean nations, and
featured clearly identified
places for various types of
goods. From the beginning,
this was a venue for trading
Sidi Youssef
Mosque 4
Rue Sidi ben Ziad.
T
HIS BUILDING IS located on
the first floor above the
shops, which provided Muslim
mosques with a revenue
during the Turkish era. One of
the most interesting Ottoman
sacred buildings, the mosque
has the the oldest Turkish
minaret in the medina (1616).
The octagonal minaret is set
on a square base and is typical
of Ottoman architecture. Most
of the 48 columns (eight rows
of six columns) in the prayer
hall feature antique capitals
and are North African in
design. Adjacent to the
mosque is the mausoleum of
its founder – Sidi Youssef –
which has a pyramid roof of
green tiles. The complex is
completed by the medersa,
which was built in 1622.

Sidi Youssef Mosque with its 
17th-century minaret
conducting financial
transactions, as well as
being the centre of
social life. Arab souks,
as opposed to
European markets,
were never places of
residence for the
merchants. The Great
Mosque was always
the seat of learning
and faith, while the
souks constituted the
town’s economic
centre. Souks may
seem chaotic but
actually have a strict
hierarchy. The
immediate vicinity of
the Great Mosque was
reserved for the up-
market bazaars selling
articles such as
religious books,
perfumes, carpets and
jewellery. In Muslim
countries, the market was, and
continues to be, an important
element of Islamic life. The
souk is a place where people
come to shop, trade and
meet friends. According to
Muslim tradition, trading is
the sweetest occupation.
The medieval Arab scholar 
al-Ghazali, for instance,
considered commerce as a
form of preparation for the
rewards of the next world.
Haggling is a strictly
scripted performance: both
parties must end up believing
that they have struck a good
bargain. Any customer who
engages in a long bargaining
process should not pull out of
the deal at the end (see p291).

Were it not for the dogged
determination of its people,
Jerba would remain no more
than a scrap of desert. The
inhabitants of the island have
managed to turn the barren
island into one big garden,
however, with olive and
orange groves and orchards.
There are about 4,000 wells on
the island, and the tourist zone is
supplied with water by an aqueduct.
Beautiful whitewashed mosques and
traditional menzels hidden behind
high hedges add to Jerba’s charm.
According to myth, Odysseus
landed here and nearly lost his crew
to the amnesia-inducing food of the
resident lotus-eaters. From the 4th
century BC, Jerba was ruled from
Carthage; later on it passed into the
hands of the Romans. The island’s
prosperity is derived from trading in
fish, olive oil and ceramics.
The advent of Islam in the 7th
century was accompanied by
the arrival of the Ibadites, an
austere Islamic school of
religious thought and practice
that was hostile to authority.
Their descendants still
inhabit western parts of the
island. In the 16th century
the Malekite School began to
gain popularity and now the
majority of Jerba’s population is
Sunni Muslim. There is also a small
but significant Jewish contingent,
whose ancestors arrived here some
2,000 years ago. Hara Sghira’s
synagogue is still a place of reverence
for Jews.
Medenine was once an important
stopping point for caravans and is a
good base for forays into the villages
scattered among the nearby hills.
JERBA AND THE
REA
T
HE ISLAND OF JERBA lies at the southern end of the Gulf of Gab¯s,
5 km (3 miles) from the mainland. It is known for its
wonderful sandy beaches, its warm climate and its
picturesque capital of Houmt Souk. Other attractions include fortified
smallholdings (menzels) and Ibadite mosques. Back on the mainland,
the area around Medenine has scenic hills and ancient villages.

heritage are still evident. The
main attraction is the town’s
famous ribat (fortified Islamic
monastery), which was built
in AD 796 as a coastal
defensive fortress, and the
first on the African continent.
The Great Mosque, just south
of the ribat, dates from the
9th century. After 1534
Monastir, along with Sousse
and Sfax, enjoyed a high
degree of autonomy. At this
time it resembled a small
republic and often gave
shelter to pirates. 
In the 20th century, Habib
Bourguiba tried to make
Monastir into a smart modern
metropolis. He ordered the
National Palace to be built
near the Phoenician
settlement of El-Kadima
and encircled the
ribat with a
magnificent
esplanade. At

ONASTIR WAS FOUNDED BY the Phoenicians as
a port and is a little way south of Sousse.
Julius Caesar camped here before the Battle
of Thapsus in AD 46 but the town’s main
claim to fame, aside from being a popular
resort, is as the birthplace of ex-president
Habib Bourguiba. Bourguiba lived here
until his death in 2000. He is now buried in
the cemetery on the town’s northern edge.

This large square lies
between the medina and a
seaside boulevard (Route de

and the ribat there is a well-
stocked Handicraft Centre

range of Tunisian souvenirs.
The items sold here carry the
government certificate of
authenticity and are generally
of a reasonable quality. 
The square is flanked by
government

the theatre are
located nearby.

Monastir is a university town
and provincial capital and
stands on a small rugged
headland in the Gulf of

player in the Tunisian tourist
industry and large hotel

shops are everywhere. The
signs of Habib Bourguiba’s

schoolboy, streets named
after members of his family
and a Bourguiba Mosque.

O
F ALL THE NORTH AFRICAN COUNTRIES, Tunisia is the most visitor-
S
friendly. Its attractions include the walled medinas of Tunis
and Sousse, historic remains at Bulla Regia and Dougga,
and Jerba’s glorious beaches. For the more adventurous, there is much
to explore including ancient troglodyte villages, the glimmering Chott
el-Jerid salt flats and the vast expanse of the Sahara Desert.
The history of Tunisia has been
shaped by the Phoenicians,
Romans, Turks, Berbers
and – above all – the
Arabs. The mountainous
north acts as the country’s
garden, providing cereals,
vegetables and fruit. This
area has many Phoenician
and Roman remains, and
includes the once-mighty Carthage.
In contrast to the fertile north, the
yellow-red desert in the south is
almost completely deprived of rain.
Here, Tozeur and Nefta are
fascinating towns that have grown
up around desert oases. Nefta,
surrounded by desert sands, once
provided a refuge for Muslim mystics,
and now produces the best dates in
Tunisia. Even further south
there is nothing but desert
– an endless sea of hot
sand. Many visitors flock to
“blue” Tunisia, to enjoy the
warm waters and beaches
of Hammamet, Sousse and
Jerba, but the country has
much more to offer.
Tunisia’s colourful past has
left it rich in historical remains. These
include the sites of Phoenician and
Roman Carthage, the ruins of the
Punic town of Kerkouane, the
Roman remains at Dougga, the
amphitheatre at El-Jem, the holy city
of Kairouan and the magnificent
medinas of Tunis and Sousse where
Islamic architecture dating back
more than 1,000 years can be seen.

SOCIETY
Tunisia has a population of almost 
10 million and the vast majority of
the country’s inhabitants, some 98
per cent, is of Arab stock. Nearly all
are Muslim, though there is a tiny
percentage of Jews and Christians.
The original Berbers make up a
small part of the population and
are found mainly in the south of
the country. 
Tunisian society is young;
the average age is 26 and
slightly over one quarter of
the population is under the
age of 15. A family
planning policy introduced
in the 1960s has brought
about a steady fall in the
birth rate and the model of
the Tunisian family has gradually
changed since independence. It is
now becoming common for Tunisian
women to go out to work.
As a result of factors such as
these, families living in the
major towns and cities are
generally smaller in size than
those in the villages. 
Tunisia has a modern and
well-developed education
system; primary education is
compulsory and a great deal
of importance is attached to
learning foreign languages in
school. Nearly three-quarters
of the population is literate.
CULTURE AND TRADITIONS
Tunisia’s busy tourist areas show many
signs of western influence, including
fast food, modern pop music and the
latest fashions. Elsewhere, traditional
life has developed at a gentler pace
and the mosque and bathhouse
(hammam) are still important
parts of everyday life. Tunisian
culture has evolved over the
generations through an
intermingling of strands
from both European and
Arab traditions. Successive
cultures, 
rather 
than 
simply supplanting their
predecessors, blended with
them 
to 
produce 
a
wonderfully diverse social
and cultural melting pot. This blend is
most clearly manifested in Tunisian
music, which displays Berber and
Andalusian influences (these also have
echoes in modern Tunisian pop music). 
Tunisian literature is mainly
associated with Arabic writing (see
pp32–3). In its early days, it consisted
primarily of theological and historic
works. The 20th century saw an
increase in the popularity of Tunisian
writers expressing themselves in
French. The most famous modern
Tunisian writer is Abu el-Kacem el-
Chabbi (1909–34), a native of Tozeur,

whose poem “Will to Live” is
taught to schoolchildren
throughout the Arab world. 
Though open to foreign
ideas, Tunisian society is very
protective of its traditions. The
hijab (veil or headscarf) is
often seen on the streets of
Tunisia, though it is more
common in rural areas.
Muslim festivals are celebrated
with due ceremony in Tunisia,
particularly two feasts known as Aïd
el-Adha and Aïd el-Fitr (see p39).
Ramadan – the month of fasting from
sunrise to sunset – is strictly
observed. As with most
Islamic countries, family
is particularly important
in Tunisian society and
relatives are expected to
celebrate 
festivities
together, as well as help
one another.
THE ARTS
Pottery and ceramic
arts have flourished since Roman
times and have been enriched by
Andalusian and Italian influences.
Ancient Tunisian mosaics are justly
famous and a great many have been
found, some of which date back to
the 2nd century AD. Most places of
any size in 3rd-century Tunisia had a
mosaic 
workshop 
producing
wonderfully colourful designs with a
distinctive African influence including
scenes of hunting and wildlife, which
were used mainly as
floor decorations. From
these early beginnings,
mosaics have become
one 
of 
the 
main
decorative elements of
Tunisian architecture. 
Many public buildings,
including hammams,
kasbahs and, above all, mosques are
works of art in their own right. All
are based on Islamic styles and
motifs and include elaborately
decorated doorways, bright colours
and striking minarets. 
Influenced by the
French and Italians,
painting has become a
popular art form in
Tunisia. The year 1949
marked the birth of the
most famous Tunisian
school of painting – the
École de Tunis. Its
pioneers combined new
trends in art with scenes
from everyday life, and
introduced modern art
to Tunisia. Yahia Turki,
an early member of this
school, is considered by

many to be the father of modern
Tunisian painting.
The traditional Arab-
style 
music 
that
visitors are likely to
hear is malouf (which
means “normal”). It
was first introduced
in the 15th century
by refugees from
Andalusia. Using a
mixture of western and
Arab instruments, it is a
lively blend of Hispanic
and Arabic folk music.
MODERN-DAY POLITICS
Tunisia is a constitutional republic
and won its independence from
France on 20 March 1956 with Habib
Bourguiba, a French-educated
lawyer, as its first president. Three
years later, Tunisia’s assembly passed
a constitution that put a lot of power
in the hands of the president and
gave the country a legal system
based on a mixture of French civil
law and Islamic law. Under this
constitution, which has undergone a
series of reforms over the years, the
members of the National Assembly
are elected for five-year terms 
by a democratic vote. The
government and the prime
minister are responsible to 
the 
country’s 
elected
president. Tunisia’s
presidential role
carries supreme
executive power
and has overall
command of the
armed forces. 
Despite making a
number of major
reforms, Habib
Bourguiba
eventually lost touch with his people
and the Arab world in general and in
1987 he was replaced by his Interior
Minister Zine el-Abidine ben Ali. This
change marked a turning point in the
history of modern Tunisia. Ben Ali
abolished life presidencies and
introduced a multi-party system. At
present there are seven political
parties in Tunisia. The most powerful
of these is the ruling party, the
Democratic-Constitutional Assembly
(RCD), which is still led by Ben Ali.
A number of other parties also enjoy
popular support including the
Democratic-Socialist 
Movement
(MDS) and the Communist Party.

Islamic groups have been eliminated
from the political life of the country.
The law disallows registration of any
party whose manifesto is based on
religious or ethnic principles.
Tunisia has played an important
role in North African affairs, as well
as mediating in the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. It has also exerted a major
influence in promoting regional
economic co-operation. 
During the 1990 Gulf War public
opinion in Tunisia was strongly
behind the former Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein. Ben Ali condemned
Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait but felt
unable to fully support the United
States’ action. Tunisia also withheld
its support during the most recent
Iraq conflict. However, Ben Ali has
long strived to maintain cordial
relations with the
West 
and 
his
party continues to
have a broadly
pro-Western policy.
In 1995, Ben Ali
signed up to an
agreement with
the 
European
Union (EU) which
agreed to respect
the principles of
human rights and
democracy.
WOMEN IN TUNISIA
Thanks in large part to the influence
of Tunisia’s former president, Habib
Bourguiba, the freedom allowed to
Tunisian women is greater than in
most Muslim countries. In 1956 he
outlawed such practices as polygamy
and divorce by renunciation and
banned the hijab (veil) from schools
as part of an (unsuccessful)
campaign to phase it out altogether. 
Women in Tunisia have far more
opportunities to work than in many
Muslim countries and these days it is
not unusual for women to be
doctors, lawyers and airline pilots.
Since 1961, as a result of the family
planning policy, pharmacies have
begun to sell methods of
contraception. The signing of
further conventions during
the 
1980s 
ensured
women’s rights to
education, and to
equal pay. What this
adds up to is that the
problems faced by
Tunisian women are
not so different
from those faced by
women in the West.
In the villages,
however, where many traditional
norms still apply, the situation can be
somewhat different. If in work, it is
not unusual for
women to hand
over all of their
pay directly to
their husbands or
(if 
unmarried)
save their wages
towards a dowry.
And even though
many women can
be seen social-
izing in some of 
the European-style
cafés, they are a

less common sight in
traditional Tunisian
cafés, 
which 
are
normally occupied by
pipe-smoking, card-
playing men. But
overall, the situation
of 
women 
has
improved vastly since
the country gained
independence.
ECONOMY
Tunisia’s economy is
based on agriculture,
power generation,
tourism 
and 
the
service 
industry.
Tunisia is the world’s
largest producer of
dates (a fact not reflected in its
export figures) and the fourth largest
producer of olive oil. Mining also
plays an important part in the
country’s economy and Tunisia is
among the world’s leading producers
of phosphates.
Agricultural land occupies nearly
half of the country’s total area. The
main crops include cereals, olives,
tomatoes, oranges,
dates, pomegranates,
grapes and sugar
cane. The agricultural
sector has declined
in the last few years,
however, and Tunisia
now imports 40 per
cent of its food. 
The 
country’s
natural resources
include phosphate
rock, oil and natural
gas (in the south), as
well as iron, lead
and zinc ores.
The processing of
olive oil, petro-
chemicals 
and
ceramics account for
a significant portion of the country’s
economy, as does the production of
handicrafts (including carpets,
jewellery and tourist souvenirs).
Fishing brings in additional income
and is based mainly on tuna, sardines
and mackerel.
By far the largest share of Tunisia’s
national revenue comes from the
textile industry with most exports
going to France, the
USA, 
Italy 
and
Germany. In 1995
Tunisia signed an
agreement with the
EU that opened up
new markets. Under
this agreement, trade
tariffs should one day
be dropped, leading
to free trade between
Tunisia and the EU.
The current Tunisian
government is hoping
that this move might
eventually encourage
some much needed
foreign investment in
the country.

TOURISM
Tourism is a major
source of the country’s
income. Since 1998,
Tunisia has allocated
over 300 million dinars a
year to developing its
tourism infrastructure.
The country now attracts
some five million visitors
annually. This number
of visitors generates
nearly $2 billion a year
for the economy. The
700 or so hotels, major international
airports 
and 
passenger 
ports
connecting Tunisia to Europe (and to
the USA via Casablanca) mean
that demand can be met.
The country’s 1,300 km
(800 miles) of coastline and
the coral reef around
Tabarka makes Tunisia a
good destination for those
who want a beach holiday.
The many historic sites are also
a big draw, of course,
especially for holidaymakers
interested in ancient history.
For sports lovers, there are the
championship-quality golf courses,
and the many opportunities for
hiking, horse riding, camel-trekking,
fishing and diving. 
To cope with the demand, tourist
zones (zones touristiques) have been
created to give visitors an added
feeling of safety and comfort
within holiday villages. These
offer 
a 
high 
standard
of accommodation, lush
surroundings, easy access to
the beaches, large swimming
pool complexes, an easy-
going atmosphere and lively
entertainment. Their major
disadvantage, however, is that
they offer little of the culture
and everyday life of Tunisia.
Tourism has also been boosted by
the many film-makers who have used
the country’s stunning landscape and
architecture in the making of films
such as Star Wars (see pp34–5).

OUED
A oued (pronouced “wed”) is a riverbed.
Parched during the dry season, it fills with
water with the arrival of the rains. Often
with craggy banks, it can run for many
miles. The waters may swell suddenly – a
single downpour is enough to flood a
oued in a flash, with the turbulent flow
gouging out the valley and altering the
shape of the bed. Following rain, the banks
of the oued burst forth with vegetation.
Tunisia’s Landscape and Wildlife
S
EEN FROM THE AIR, Tunisia appears as a
golden-brown land interwoven with
green and blue. The mountainous north is
overgrown with oak forests and heather.
The Medjerda Valley, irrigated by Tunisia’s
largest permanent river, is used for
growing corn and is one of Tunisia’s most
fertile regions. The craggy northern coast
is extraordinarily picturesque, while the
eastern shores, with their sandy beaches,
are home to most of Tunisia’s hotels and
coastal resorts. In contrast to the fertile
north, Tunisia’s flat, southern desert region
is almost totally devoid of rain.

central region of the country. It is
overgrown with spiky esparto grass,
which is used in the production of

Sahara in the classic Arabic language means
“empty area”. Later, it also began to mean an area
devoid of water – a desert. You can drive for many
miles here and not see a single plant.

SAHARA DESERT
Tunisia’s desert covers the southern tip of the country.
A sea of sand (erg), it is formed of the eastern
extremity of the Great Eastern Erg (or “Grand Erg
Oriental”) which extends over a large part of eastern
Algeria. This inhospitable area is more commonly
known as the Sahara Desert. Parts of it can go for
years without rain and the rainfall in this region never
exceeds 50 mm (1.96 inches) per year.

Mountain oases and
palm oases are features
of the Tunisian
landscape. The roads
leading to them are often
extremely picturesque
and wind among
volcanic rocks.
Sandy beaches, used mainly by visitors, are
found to the east. Here there are tourist zones
(zones touristiques), which have facilities and
entertainment laid on. The beaches on
Tunisia’s north coast around Tabarka are far
less frequently visited. 
THE COAST
Tunisia has two types of coastline: rocky in
the north and, in the east, sandy shores that
gently descend towards the Mediterranean
Sea. The country’s long stretch of coast is
extended by marshland and seasonal lakes
that adjoin the sea. Tunisia has plenty of
sandy beaches. These are found mainly on 
the east coast, in the regions of Hammamet,
Gab¯s, Jerba, and on the Kerkennah Islands,
as well as in the northeast – along the Gulf of
Tunis and between Bizerte and El-Haouaria.
The extraordinarily picturesque north coast,
stretching from Bizerte into Algeria, has high
rugged cliffs. Coral reefs, rich in marine life,
can be found here that are unique to this part
of the Mediterranean.
CENTRAL REGIONS
The landscape of the interior is somewhat harsh, its colours
faded. To the north is the Tell region, separated from the
Tunisian Atlas range of mountains by the Medjerda River. Tell
forms the western end of the Atlas range that runs east from
Morocco. Its western section comprises agricultural land. The
southern part of the central region has two salt lakes – Chott el-
Jerid and Chott el-Gharsa – which are dry for much of the year. 
The craggy coastline around El-Haouaria
dropping steeply into the sea creates small
picturesque coves.
Rocks in Tabarka
display some of the
most striking geological
formations found along
the north coast.
Oyster-catchers are
one of many species of
wading bird found
along the sandy
regions of the coast.
Olive groves are found in the eastern parts of the central
region and on the coast. Olives, planted here in even
rows, are an important part of Tunisia’s economy.
Prickly pear, cultivated in the
r
western region of Tunisia, iss
also a popular hedge plant. It
can grow to a
height of 7 m

regions are among the greenest corners
of Tunisia, with extensive fields and

A
LONGSIDE THE OBVIOUS PRESENCE of Islam, Tunisian
architecture includes a variety of influences.
The earliest of these can be seen in the Roman
and Punic remains that are scattered throughout
the northern regions and along the coast. Much
later, the colonial era brought with it new civic
styles including the French Ville Nouvelle with
wide streets, public parks and houses with
elaborate street-facing fa˜ades. Ancient Berber
architecture is most common in the south of the
country where the troglodyte pit houses and
ksour (fortified granaries) reveal a way of life that
has changed little over the centuries.
Tunisian Architecture
SOUTHERN ARCHITECTURE
Some Berbers of southern Tunisia lived partly underground.
Their ancient homes, dug down into circular pits, maintained
the same temperature of about 17° C (63° F) throughout the
year. This building tradition goes back many hundreds of
years, but the most famous homes of this type, found in
Matmata, date from the 19th century. A “pit house” was
inhabited by just one family, with the number of rooms 
being appropriate to the family’s size and wealth.
Makthar – the remains of one of many
Roman towns in Tunisia 
PUNIC ARCHITECTURE
Punic architecture is associated mainly with Carthage,
which was founded in 813 BC. Its most obvious feature
is a distinct town layout, with houses built on slopes
around a square. Another hallmark of this style is the
horizontal and vertical arrangement of building stones,
known as opus africanum. Coastal towns often had
two harbours, northern and southern, which were used
depending on the wind direction.
The temples were built in the
mountains, close to springs,
trees and stones, which were
seen as sacred.

Carthage’s most
important Roman
sites. What little
remains gives

living quarters,

two levels.
The entrance and inner walls
are white. Simple rooms have
recesses and dug-out shelves for
storing everyday items.
Carthage has many remains of Punic
architecture, although they can be
hard to spot amid the Roman ruins.

ROMAN ARCHITECTURE
A typical Roman town was constructed on a chequered layout.
At its heart was the forum, which was dominated by a temple
(capitol) devoted to various deities. Everyday life concentrated
around the market square. Entertainment was provided by the
theatre, and the baths were used for relaxation and hygiene.
The Capitol in Dougga
was built to stand on the
town’s highest point.
The theatre was of equal
importance as the capitol.
Some could accommodate
an audience of several
thousand people.
THE COLONIAL ERA
With the advent of the French
protectorate in 1881, Tunisian towns
acquired straight avenues, flanked
by public buildings. The style of the
day combined European and Islamic
elements. European design
incorporated arcades and horseshoe
arches and the fa˜ades of elegant
villas were further embellished with
loggias and balconies adorned with
beautiful wrought-iron grilles.

early 20th-century
Modernist house owned by
George Sebastian.
Buildings in towns such as
Tunis and Bizerte were designed
in contemporary styles. Multi-
storey hotels and apartment
blocks often bore the signs of
Modernism and Art Nouveau. 
MODERN ARCHITECTURE
Initially, 20th-century Tunisian architecture
was under the influence of Art Nouveau. The
Art Deco style arrived during the 1920s and
30s, bringing with it more geometric
ornamental patterns. The late 1990s marked
a return to simpler, traditional forms. 
Contemporary

Tunisia can be

blend of modern
materials, such
as smoked glass,
and Islamic
influences.
Tunis’s Cathedral, with its
eclectic mix of forms and
styles, is one of the few
remaining churches from
the colonial era.

T
UNISIA HAS BEEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE of Islam since
the 7th century and this is apparent in its
architecture. The most striking example of this
influence is the large number of mosques, with their
distinctive minarets. Other Islamic buildings include
medersas, zaouias (tombs) and the humble hammam
or bathhouse. Islamic architecture is the result of many
cultures and includes Roman, Moorish and Persian
elements. However, from grand Aghlabid buildings to
domestic courtyards, a number of common features run
through it. These include the horseshoe arch, richly-
coloured tiles forming swirling Arabesques and the
frequent use of carved plaster as a decorative element. 
Islamic Architecture
MINARETS
Minarets (from the Arabic for
lighthouse) are found at one
corner of a mosque.
According to tradition, the
Prophet Mohammed
intended to use a trumpet
(as did the Jews) or a rattle
to call the faithful to prayer
but one of his disciples saw
a mysterious apparition that
revealed to him the words of
a prayer. Mohammed
instructed the Bilal (the first
muezzin), endowed with a
powerful voice, to learn the
words. Since then, five times
a day, the muezzin’s chant
cuts through the daily bustle
of Muslim towns and
villages. There are two main
styles of minarets found in
Tunisia; the older one has a
rectangular base, while the
ones built on an octagonal
plan were popularized by
the Turks.
Elaborate doorways, a typical
feature of Islamic architecture
Mosques were often surrounded by
zaouias (tombs). These were used as
burial grounds for Islamic holy men
(marabouts) and serve as destinations
for pilgrimages. One such complex can
be found in Le Kef.
MOSQUES
The mosque or masjid (“a
place of worship”) is one of
the main forms of Islamic
architecture. The basic
elements include a courtyard
surrounded by columns, and
a prayer hall. The design is
thought to be based on the
house that belonged to
Mohammed in Medina which
had an oblong courtyard
with huts. This courtyard has
become the prayer hall
which faces toward Mecca.
The hall is separated from
the rest of the mosque by a
step or balustrade.
Bourguiba Mosque in
Monastir is a modern
building but has some
traditional features.

ZAOUIAS
Zaouias are humble resting
places for people who have
dedicated their lives to Islam.
Simple in design, they are
usually whitewashed and less
grand than mausoleums, and
can be found dotted around the
towns and villages of Tunisia.
Initially the name was given to
an isolated part of a mosque
that was used as a gathering
place for Muslim mystics,
mainly ascetic Sufis. Following
the death of its master, a zaouia
often became a sanctuary that
attracted pilgrims.
Zaouia in Mahdia, situated outside the town beside a cemetery.
The site is conducive to meditation. Zaouias are not only used as
places of pilgrimage but often have a social function as well. They
may be used to hold a weekly market, for instance.
MEDERSAS
In the Middle Ages, a medersa was a law school, a type of
Muslim university, and the main centre for promoting Sunni
orthodoxy, Muslim law and theology. They generally
included lecture halls and, as students traditionally lived
there, boarding rooms. Designed along the same lines as a
mosque, merdersas have an inner courtyard beyond the
main entrance and also a prayer hall. The classrooms are
generally located to the side of the courtyard. Most often
found in the medina of large towns and cities, medersas can
have incredibly elaborate decoration.
The courtyard of a medersa is surrounded by arcades,
much like a mosque. The shaded arcades sheltered visitors 
and provided a place for quiet contemplation.
BAB
A bab is a door or gate that not
only leads into a town but is
also used to divide a town’s
areas into smaller quarters,
creating a feeling of security, and
guarding against unwelcome
visitors. In the 20th century
many of the gates disappeared,
turning the private areas into
public ones. But even now in
Tunis or Kairouan, there are still
gates that are centuries-old
leading to private homes.
Bab Diwan is one of
the gates leading to the
medina in Sfax.
Medinas were always surrounded by
high walls. Entry was through a
number of gates guarded by fortified
towers or bastions.
KASBAH
The kasbah is a specific type of
fortress palace. It was normally the
residence of the local ruler but it
also provided shelter for the local
population. Kasbahs (or citadels)
were generally built on hilltops,
mountain slopes or near harbours.
Their distinctive features include
high walls and small windows.
Some of the most beautiful
examples have survived in Sousse,
Le Kef and Tunis.

spread as early as the second half of
the 7th century. It rapidly became
the dominant religion and, despite a
period of colonial rule, remains so
today. Islam is the state religion,
though Tunisia’s system of
government is largely secular.
Islamic customs play a major
role in people’s lives and over
98 per cent of Tunisians profess
adherence to the practices of Sunni Islam.
Mosques are decorated with
geometric patterns, plant motifs and
verses from the Koran.
Ceramic tiles
are a popular
decorative
element and
often adorn
mosques or
other religious

KORAN
The Koran, or Quran, is the holy book
of Islam and was revealed by God to
Mohammed with the angel Gabriel
acting as an intermediary. Mohammed
is believed to have been illiterate, and
the first written texts of the Koran were
compiled after the Prophet’s death. The
Koran consists of 114 suras (chapters),
starting with the longest and finishing
with the shortest. The first sura
revealed to Mohammed is thought to
be number 96. The Koran is in verse
and every Muslim is expected to learn
it by heart.
Pages of the
religious books
produced for
many wealthy
Muslims were
often richly
ornamented.
Koranic verses
are written in a
decorative script
and are believed
to be the literal
word of God.

Before entering
the prayer hall it
is obligatory for
the faithful to
remove their
shoes. Similar to
the practice of
ritual washing,
the aim is to
ensure spiritual
cleanliness.

A mosque is a place of communal worship for
Muslims. Separated from the outside world by high
walls, a mosque’s most distinctive feature is its minaret.
A Muslim is a person who “submits to
the will of God” (Islam means
submission). Pious Muslims spend long
hours studying the Koran, placing the
book on a special folding support. 
The chapters, or suras, of the
Koran are separated by elaborate
circular illuminations.
THE FIVE PILLARS
The Muslim religion rests on
five principles – the “Five
Pillars” of faith. They are:
1. shahada – an avowal of
Allah as the only God
2. salat – the obligation to pray
five times a day, facing Mecca
3. zakat – the giving of alms
to the poor
4. sawm – fasting during 
the month of Ramadan,
between the hours of sunrise
and sunset
5. hadj – pilgrimage to Mecca.
Al-Kabah in Mecca is the main
destination of Muslim pilgrimages
Prayer brings together crowds of the
faithful, who gather in the mosque
and courtyard. The women are
required to stand in an area
separated by a screen or curtain.

Tunisian Traditions
T
UNISIAN SOCIETY ATTACHES great importance to its own
traditions. These include religious festivals, rituals
associated with religious practices and customs that
predate Muslim times including the “night of henna”,
which takes place before weddings. Circumcision for
boys is commonplace. Ramadan (the month in which
devout Muslims fast between sunrise and sunset) is
celebrated with great ceremony. In the provinces it is
customary for people to visit public baths, wear
jewellery with magic talismans, and make pilgrimages
to the tombs of Muslim holy men. The family is held in
high esteem throughout the country, with frequent
gatherings of its members and communal meals.
Henna – a dye obtained from
ground privet leaves. The
painted patterns are believed
to protect and purify.
Tunisian women are supposed to cover their
heads. The traditional veil (hijab) is found in
various forms all over the Muslim world. The
sifsari (above) is mainly worn in Tunis.
The souk or market has been the centre of
town social life for hundreds of years. They are
run according to strict principles, with every
product having its own permanently allocated
space according to how close it is to the mosque:
religious items and books are top of the list
while household goods have a low status.
WEDDINGS
During the pre-Islamic 
era, the Arabs practised
polygamy. The Koran
maintained this tradition, but
limited the number of wives
to four. In Tunisia polygamy
was outlawed in 1956. As in
most cultures, a wedding is
an important public occasion,
attended by the entire family.
The bride’s feet and palms
are covered in henna tattoos.
Though dancing forms part
of the festivity, Western-style
discos and mixed dancing
are far less common.

CHECHIAS
A red cap with a silk tassel,
similar to a fez, was once
regarded as a vital element
of a man’s attire, and during
the colonial era it became
almost a national symbol.
The chechia originates from
Central Asia. Initially it was
taller and took on its
present shape around 1850.
The tassel has also had
many transformations – first
changing its colour from
blue to black and then,
around 1930, vanishing
altogether. Chechias remain
popular to this day and the
craftsmen who produce
them are held in high regard.
In modern-day Tunisia chechias
are worn mainly by older men
Games are popular in Tunisia and men can
often be seen in cafés playing dominoes, dice
and cards. Dry dates or stones may sometimes
serve as pawns in a game of chess.
Chichas – hookahs – are popular
throughout Tunisia and are used
to smoke tobacco in cafés. Solitary
smoking is rare; normally one is
ordered for a party of people.
Many men still smoke chichas and
the pipes are generally provided
free (smokers need pay only 
for the tobacco).
The custom of
circumcision involves
the removal of a boy’s
foreskin and is 
practised by Jews and
Muslims. Though the
Koran does not
pronouce on the subject,
the authority for Muslim
circumcision probably
derives from the
example of the Prophet
who is believed to be
descended from Kedar,
a descendant of
Abraham’s eldest son.

The Berbers
B
ERBERS ARE THE INDIGENOUS (non-Arab) people of
North Africa. Their name probably originates from
the Greek word “barbaroi”, which was a description
attached to anyone who did not speak Greek. The
Berbers inhabited the region from around 4000 BC,
and survived as nomads. During the 4th and 5th
centuries many Berbers converted to Christianity.
Until AD 700 they resisted the Arab invasion. Despite
having much in common with the Arabs (their
nomadic lifestyle, individualism and tribal solidarity)
and despite having quickly embraced Islam, the
Berbers have continued to maintain their own ethnic
and linguistic identity.
BERBER WOMEN
Women are the custodians of the ancient Berber
traditions. Their clothes differ considerably from
those seen in the towns. Their typical garment –
the hauli – is a draped piece of material held
with a belt and fastened with clasps (hela) at the
shoulders. To this is often added a shawl.
Women often weave cloth for their dresses at
home. The colours most often worn are deep
red, purple and indigo. The designs consist
mainly of colourful stripes.
The International Sahara Festival, held
in November or December, attracts many
visitors. The event includes expert displays
of horsemanship and recreations of
nomadic ceremonies such as weddings
and caravan departures.
Berber ceramics are easily recognizable by their pure
abstract designs that are reminiscent of tattoos. The
most popular colours include beige, red ochre and
black. Here, the geometric design is first drawn in raw
clay then the grooves are filled with black resin.
Berber women decorate their
faces and hands with henna
patterns in order to protect
themselves from evil spirits.

A fortified Berber village is known as a ksar.
Ksour (the plural of ksar) were originally
r
granaries with ghorfas (rooms) situated around
an inner courtyard and reached by a concealed
entrance. After some time, people began to live in
ksour and some are still inhabited today.
Agriculture and stock keeping are the
main occupations of the Berbers. There
are some 50,000–90,000 currently living
in Tunisia. Most of them inhabit
mountain oases. Some villages are
becoming short of men, who move to
towns in search of work. It is therefore
left to the women to cultivate the land.

beauty on the wearer.
The Berber social system is based on
a tribal structure. Berber women
perform most of the domestic duties,
such as washing, but have
maintained an independent status.

A
LTHOUGH IT WAS THE PHOENICIANS
A
who introduced the
alphabet to the Mediterranean region, few of their
writings have survived, except for some inscriptions
dating from the Punic era. Any survey of Tunisian
literature, therefore, must start with the Roman and
Byzantine periods. The most outstanding writer who
worked in the area of present-day Tunisia was St
Augustine. Later, the widespread reading of the Koran
played an enormous role in the development of Arab
literature. The ranks of prominent Arab writers include
the 8th–9th-century Al-Jahiz. Tunisian literature is little
known beyond its borders.

ARAB LITERATURE
T
HE BEGINNINGS OF Arabic
literature go back to the
6th century and pre-Islamic
times. The legacy of this
early period consists mainly
of Bedouin writings. Many of
these were poems and were
preserved in oral traditions.
The most famous authors to
have survived from this time
are the writers of the al-
Mu’allaqat (The Seven Odes).
Most notable among these
are Antarah, Tarafah and
Imru’al-qays who, along
with others, produced 
a wide-ranging
collection of 
poems covering
everything from
court life to love
and adventure.
Court poetry
flourished during
the Ummayad rule
(7th–8th century
AD). During this
time love poetry
became the vogue. The most
famous of these recounts the
plight of Qays who is driven
mad by his love for Layla
and is afterwards known as
Majnun (the demented one).
ROMAN WRITERS
T
HE MOST FAMOUS author to
live in the area of present-
day Tunisia was St Augustine
(354–430). Born in Tagaste
(in what is now Souk Ahras
in Algeria), Augustine studied
philosophy in Carthage. He
was at first attracted to the
philosophy of Plato but a
study of St Paul’s writings
induced him to become
baptised as a Christian. He
recorded his thoughts in
numerous writings, including
the Treatise on the Holy
Trinity, and a dissertation
y
entitled On the Divine State.
His most accessible work,
however, is the Confessions,
which combines theological
and philosophical
meditations with insightful
personal and semi-
autobiographical writings.
Arabic manuscript from the National Library in Tunis
Another influential Christian
writer and theologian was
Tertullian, who wrote in
Latin, and lived at the
beginning of the 3rd century.
Tertullian was a Carthaginian
lawyer who converted to
Christianity in Rome after
being deeply moved by the
attitude of the Christian
martyrs. One
interesting document
from this period is
the anonymously
written Martyrdom
of St Perpetua and
St Felicity in which
the heroism of
these two 
young women is
graphically
described. Tertullian
became a priest and the first
Christian writer to work in
Latin. His numerous works,
produced in Carthage, 
gave western Christianity 
its Latin foundations.

writer of the Roman era in Tunisia

comedy Metamorphoses is
still studied today.

MUSIC IN TUNISIA
I
SLAMIC MUSIC springs from a
number of cultures. The
kind of music that is most
frequently heard is
malouf. This
f
traditional folk
music typically
features a solo
vocalist. Malouf music
lacks the polyphony 
that typifies European
music and can sound
repetitive to some
western ears. Another
form of traditional
music is mouashahat
dawa, which
originates from Syria
and Egypt. An important
element of this is the qasida
– a type of poetry popular in
pre-Islamic Arabia, and later
at the courts of the caliphs
and provincial rulers. 
The skill involved in this
type of music lies in the
interpretation of the sung
version of qasida. The piece
begins with a motif that
returns repeatedly, in a strict
order. Many musicians
practise both styles of music.
Traditional music has a
broad appeal in Tunisia
among all ages, and
one of the most
popular groups is
the all-female El-
Azifet. The ranks of famous
t
musicians who play
traditional music with
Mediterranean overtones
include Anur Brahem (lute).
Sahnoun ibn Sa’id
is devoted to the
life and teachings
of the Prophet.
However, the most
famous writer born
in Tunisia is Ibn
Khaldoun
(1332–1406), an
outstanding
historian who is
regarded as the
founding father of
sociology and
political science. He
compiled his studies and
thoughts in a grand work on
world history, Kitab al-Ibar
(The Book of Experience).
More famous than the main
text, however, is the
Muqaddimah, or foreword,
in which he summarises the
state of contemporary
knowledge, and attempts to
explain social and economic
processes.
Many of Abu
Nuwas’s themes were
continued by
Mohammed an-
Nafzawi in the 14th
century, the author of 
the erotic Perfumed
Garden. Then, following
a period of stagnation,
Tunisian literature
blossomed once
again at the end of
the 19th century with
writers such as Abu
el-Kacem el-Chabbi (1909–
1934), who gave Arabic
literature a fresh lease of life.
The most famous living
Tunisian writer is Albert

MALOUF
Arabic music from Andalusia arrived in
North Africa in the late 15th century. In
Tunisia the word malouf became
f
synonymous with music.
The malouf ensemble
consists of a lute, 
a sitar, a violin-
type instrument
called a rbab and
a variety of
percussion
instruments (a
tambourine and a small
drum). The music shows
clear Berber influences,
particularly in its rhythm.
The period of the Aghlabid
dynasty was a golden age of
Arabic literature and saw the
birth of literary prose. The
best-known writer from this
period is Abu Nuwas who
died in the 9th century.
Much of his life was spent in
the pursuit of pleasure and
his witty poems are drawn
from urban life. One of his
famous lines is “Accumulate
as many sins as you can”.

novel, The Pillar of Salt,

relatively small area, that
attracts film-makers.
Northern Tunisia has even
stood in for Japan in Frédéric
Mitterrand’s Madame
Butterfly, while other regions
of the country – squeezed
between Libya, Algeria and
the Mediterranean Sea, have
been used as the Holy Land
for Franco Zeffirelli’s Jesus of
Nazareth. In the early 1950s,
Tunisia proved the ideal
location for the Hollywood
adaptations of Nobel Prize
winner Henryk Sienkiewicz’s
novels including Quo Vadis.
Steven Spielberg also used it
to shoot many of the scenes
for Raiders of the Lost Ark,
while the medina in Monastir
featured in Monty Python’s
Life of Brian.
It was no accident that the
majority of scenes for Roman
Polanski’s Pirates were shot
on the Sahel coast, a dozen
or so kilometres north of
Sousse. Tunisia was once a
jumping-off point for
Mediterranean corsairs and
the base of the famous Red
Beard (Barbarossa). Today,

the designs tend to be
based on a central
diamond shape that is
thought to derive
from the lamp in the
Great Mosque in
Kairouan. Knotted carpets
come in two main types:
Alloucha and Zarbia. Zarbia
carpets use reds, greens and
blues while the Alloucha
carpets are produced in
beiges, browns and whites.

dates back to Punic
times but flourished with the
Roman occupation. When
artists first began to produce
intricate patterns using
tesserae – finely polished
pieces of brick, glass and
marble – the workshops
could not keep up with
demand. Mosaics were used
everywhere – from the
floors in public
baths, to the
domes and the
walls of public
buildings. After
the 3rd century,
they also began
to be used in
private homes
which led to a
distinctive naturalistic
Tunisian style.

red woollen cap. It was
originally worn under the
turban, but with time it
became an item of headgear
and a symbol of Tunisian
national identity. The
production of mats, baskets
and fans is also widespread.
These are woven using grass
and date palm leaves. In
recent years increasing
numbers of artists have
returned to the tradition of
painting on glass, an art
form inspired by
Egyptian and
Syrian examples.
Items to look
out for include

PRING IS TUNISIA’S most
colourful season with
many flowers in bloom at
this time. March and April
are ideal for exploring the
country. The heat is not
oppressive, yet daytime
temperatures rise above 
20° C (68° F). Rains can be
heavy but usually come in
the form of brief showers.
The first half of March is the
final opportunity to embark
on a camel trek across the
desert; April brings
sandstorms; May is filled
with the scent of jasmine and
the warming seas herald the
arrival of summer.

O
NE OF THE most pleasant
times to visit Tunisia is in
spring when flowers are
in 
full 
bloom 
and 
the
temperature has not yet
reached its summer peak.
During summer, the most
comfortable place to be is
on the coast where sea
breezes cool the air. By
autumn the temperature is
starting to lower, making the all-
important work of harvesting olives a
little more bearable. The Tunisian
winter can get very cold,
especially high up in the
mountains, while on the coast
the weather can be damp and
rather dreary. Public holidays
in Tunisia are mostly bound
up with Islam and take place
according to the Islamic
calendar
(see opposite).
Visitors should get specific
details of festivals and events when
they are in the country.

THE ISLAMIC CALENDAR
Muslim religious festivals are celebrated in accordance with
the lunar calendar, with each year composed of 12 months
and each month of 29 or 30 days. The Muslim year is 11
days shorter than the Gregorian (Western) year. The dates
of festivals depend upon the sighting of the new moon for
the start of a new month. Ramadan – the month of fasting
– is solemnly celebrated. Friday is held as a holy day;
however, unlike the majority of Arab countries, it is not
regarded as a public holiday in Tunisia.
Al-Hijra
The first day of the Muslim
year, this marks the
anniversary of the Hijra (the
name given to the Prophet
Mohammed’s migration
from Mecca to Medina). 
Aïd el-Adha (“the day of offering”)
This is one of the most important dates in the Muslim
calendar. It marks the day when, by divine order,
Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son before Allah
interceded by providing a ram in place of the child.
Mouloud 
This is the anniversary of the
Prophet Mohammed’s birth
and is celebrated on the
twelfth day of rabi al-aoual,
the third month of the
Muslim calendar. For the
majority of the population,
it is an occasion for family
gatherings and festivities.
Aïd el-Fitr (“the
small festival”)
This festival marks
the end of the
month of Ramadan,
and begins on the
evening of the last
day of the 30-day
fast. Custom
decrees that on 
this day entirely
new clothes, from
headscarf to socks
are put on, and
that money is given
to children and
people in need.

Ramadan
is the Muslim holy
month when the
faithful renew their
covenant with Allah
through fasting
during the hours of
daylight. It is only
after the sun has set,
following communal
prayers, that Muslims
are allowed to eat
meals and 
special sweets.

SUMMER
S
UMMER TEMPERATURES on the
coast can reach 40° C
(104° F) but the sea breezes
temper the heat. The south of
the country is hotter still, and
even the nights don’t bring
relief. Market stalls fill with
every variety of melon
and other fruit and
vegetables. Summer in
Tunisia is the
traditional season for
weddings; it is also a
time when most
people visit, filling
the hotels and
beaches. Many of
the concerts and
festivals are staged
throughout the
country at this
time of year.

DECEMBER
Olive Festivals, Jerba,
Mahdia, Kairouan, Kalaa
Kebira. The production of
olives is an important part of
Tunisia’s economy and the
end of the olive harvest, also
celebrated in other towns, is
a big event and always
accompanied by a lot of fun.
WINTER
W
INTER WEATHER
W
is the
most unsettled of all.
W
There are days when the
midday temperature on the
coast and inland rises above
24° C (75° F); but when the
winds blow, the chill can be
felt not only on Cap Bon,
but also way down in the
south. These conditions
discourage many visitors,
and some hotels and
restaurants in tourist resorts
are closed. The end of
winter is usually very sunny,
but the winter sun gives little
in the way of warmth.
The advent of winter is
marked in many regions by
festivals celebrating the end
of the olive and date
harvests. These are fairly low
profile events, and apart
from the Douz and Dakar
Rally, are unlikely to draw
large crowds of visitors.
JANUARY
New Year (1 Jan). The
European New Year is
celebrated by many
Tunisians within
their family circle.
Celebration of the
Muslim New Year
is equally quiet and
occurs later. 
The Dakar Rally.
This major
endurance race
draws many big-
name teams and
thousands of
motoring fans to
Tunisia. For a few
days the normally
quiet roads fill with
off-road cars,
motorcycles and
trucks. The rally
route changes each
year so that it can
pass through
different sections of
the Sahara Desert.
FEBRUARY
Aïd el-Adha. This is a major
feast in the Tunisian
calendar. It takes place 68
days after the end of
Ramadan and marks the day
when Abraham, under divine
orders, prepared to sacrifice
his son. The day is celebrated
throughout the Arab world
and families who can afford
it sacrifice an animal as
Abraham is believed to have
done as a substitute for his
son. According to tradition,
one third of the meat is
distributed to the poor while
the remainder is consumed
within the family circle to
mark the festival.

T
HE RICH CULTURAL AND SOCIAL HERITAGE that can be found in
modern-day Tunisia is largely due to the major powers that
have inhabited this area including the Phoenicians, the
Romans, the Vandals, the Arabs and the French. Tunisia is one of the
oldest countries in Africa and the name given to it by the Romans –
Ifriqiyya – came to designate the entire continent.

The earliest prehistoric
humans most probably
appeared here during
the early Palaeolithic
era, and primitive stone
tools discovered near
Kebili in the south date
this early activity to about
200,000 years ago. At this
time the climate was very
different and the area that
is now called the Sahara
had regular rainfall and
may well have been
covered in forest. From these early
beginnings evolved the Aterians,
who were able to make and use
specialized tools. The Aterians were
followed, about 10,000 years ago,
by fair-skinned tribes from western
Asia who brought with them the
ability to make flint tools. These
Capsian people, named after
archaeological finds near Gafsa
(which was earlier known as
Capsa), settled in southern Tunisia
and developed a sophisticated
culture with a language and early
forms of art. They lived here until
about 4500 BC and, as well as being
hunter-gatherers, began to develop
forms of agriculture, domesticating
several species of animals. In
addition, the discovery
of a number of early
archaeological sites and
engravings indicates
that the people of this
period had probably
developed some form of
religious beliefs and
practised various rituals,
such as burials, although it is
now difficult to determine
their nature. It is from these
early people that the
Berbers (the indigenous
non-Arab North Africans) are
probably descended. 
The information about Berber
culture and religious beliefs prior to
the arrival of the Phoenicians in
1100 BC is scarce. Their name
derives from the Greek word
“barbaroi” – meaning anyone who
could not speak Greek. The majority
of Berbers lived in family-based
tribal societies, were nomadic and
spoke a language that belongs to
the Hamitic group of languages.
Roman expansion impinged on their
freedom and, because of their
intense spirit of independence, the
Berbers have often found themselves
in conflict with the dominant power
throughout Tunisia’s history.

THE PHOENICIANS
The so-called Punic period (the name
given to 128 years of war between
the Phoenicians and the emerging
Roman empire) began about 814 BC
with the founding of Carthage. The
Phoenicians were supreme sailors and
colonized many islands and coastal
regions, which they established as
trading posts. They built new towns,
mostly on craggy headlands, with two
harbours – to the north and south, so
that they could be used
regardless of the wind
direction 
and 
the
season of the year. As
the compass had not
yet been invented, they
had to navigate by the
stars – mainly by Ursa
Minor, the Little Bear.
r
Their 
longest 
sea
voyage 
was 
the
circumnavigation of
Africa, which was
accomplished on the
orders of the Egyptian
pharaoh Nechon, in
600 BC. An account of
this historic voyage can
be 
found 
in 
the
writings of Herodotus.

CARTHAGE
The foundation of Carthage is
linked to Dido, Princess of
Tyre. Persecuted by her
brother, Pygmalion, who
murdered her husband, she
fled her homeland. Having
arrived at what is now Tunisia,
she pleaded with the local
chieftain, Labus, to give her a
piece of land big enough to
cover the hide of a bull. Dido
cut the hide into narrow strips
and used them to encircle the
area that later became the
site 
of 
Carthage’s
fortress – Byrsa.
Despite 
such
legends, the history
behind this city is
more prosaic. The
Phoenicians, wanting
secure staging posts
along the trade route
between Tyre (in
modern-day Lebanon) and silver mines
in southern Spain,
needed a presence on
the Tunisian coast. The
outpost soon grew into
a powerful state that
took control of the
trading posts, which
were 
remote 
and
scattered over a large
area. In the 7th century
BC, the Carthaginians
were strong enough to
take control of Tyre in
the west and began
establishing colonies for
themselves. By the 4th
century BC, Carthage
had 
become 
an
independent 
state.

Agriculture and
architecture flourish
and its culture flourished and
at its peak this important
Phoenician metropolis had a
population of about 500,000.
The Phoenician colonization
was purely commercial and
did not involve any military
conquests but the success of
Carthage, which had a strong
navy and a firm grip on trade
throughout the 5th and 
4th 
century, 
inevitably
threatened to eclipse other
powers, especially Rome.
The first Punic War began in
263 BC when Rome embarked on a
campaign to take control of Sicily, 80
km (50 miles) northeast of Carthage.
These two major powers fought each
other for the next 20 years until Rome
managed to destroy the Carthaginian
fleet off Trapani (western Sicily) and
forced Carthage to surrender. 
The second Punic War began in 218
BC. This time it was Carthage that went
on the offensive. With Rome for the
time being busy with its new
conquests, Carthage had turned its
attention to its position in Africa. In an
attempt to force Rome’s hand, the
Carthaginian general Hannibal had
earlier captured a region of Spain.
Then, in 218, he crossed the Alps with
a 90,000-strong  army and 37 elephants
and launched what would turn out to
be an unsuccessful assault on Rome. 
The third Punic War began in 149 BC
when the Romans landed in Utica and
laid siege to Carthage. The mighty city
fell three years later and was destroyed.
The Romans took possession and the
former territory of Carthage became the
Roman province of Africa.

THE ROMANS
The 
destruction 
of
Carthage in 146 BC was
followed 
by 
the
foundation of the Roman
province of Africa, with
its capital in Utica – a
former Punic colony.
This was the first Roman
colony outside Italy and
covered the territory of
northeastern Tunisia.
The land captured from
Carthage became ager
publicus – state-owned
land on which a tribute
was levied. Only the
towns that had surrendered to the
Romans during the war were exempt.
In 44 BC, the “infernal land”, now
dedicated to the goddess Juno,
became the site of Julia Carthage.
The former city was resurrected
and became the capital of this
part of the world for several
centuries. In 27 BC, a new
consular province was created –
Africa Proconsularis – with
a resident proconsul in
Carthage. It covered the
area from Cyrta in the west
to Cyrenaica in the east. After the
years of wars, the reign of Octavian
Augustus brought with it stability and
created a new climate for economic
development.
During the period of the
Flavian dynasty (AD
69–96), Rome continued
with 
its 
southerly
expansion. The building
and maintenance of roads
assisted 
with 
the
development of trade and
communication.
Agriculture became
increasingly important to
the area and the Romans
turned the wheat-growing
plains of the Medjerda
Valley into a “bread-
basket” with the region
supplying some 60 per
cent of the Empire’s requirements for
grain. This produced a golden age for
the African economy. Its wealth
was based on the cultivation of
corn and olives, and also on its
vineyards. 
Many 
locals,
including the Berbers, prospered
under the new regime and a
number of colonies sprang up on
the Tunisian coastline that
provided 
holiday 
and
retirement 
homes 
for
wealthy Romans. With so
much Roman influence this
part of Africa underwent a gradual
process of Romanization. Roman
towns sprang up everywhere.
Religious buildings were erected to
honour gods such as Juno and
Minerva. Nearly one sixth of Roman
senators were of African origin at
this time. Africa even provided
an Emperor, the Libyan-born
Septimius Severus.
The smooth running of the
African economy was briefly
upset in 238 when Gordian,
the proconsul of  Africa,
proclaimed himself emperor

BYZANTIUM
The political makeup of
the Roman Empire was
changed forever with the
adoption of Christianity
by Constantine the Great
in 312. Much of Rome’s
power was transferred to
Byzantium (Istanbul),
which was to control the eastern
portion of the Roman Empire.
In 533 the Byzantine Emperor
Justinian, who dreamt of reasserting
Roman authority, sent his general
Belisarius to attack the Vandals at the
Battle of Ad Decinum, near present-
day Tunis. Belisarius had a swift and
decisive victory and on 15 September
533 he entered Carthage.
The next century of Byzantine rule
was not so easy. Despite building
heavy fortifications, constant Berber
resistance and insurrection in the
army meant that the Byzantine hold
on Tunisia was weak.
in a gesture of defiance against the
heavy taxes imposed by Rome.
Gordian sent his son, Gordian II, into
battle against Capellianus, the
governer of Numidia, who was loyal
to Rome. Gordian II was killed on
the battlefield and, on hearing of his
death the father killed himself. He
had ruled for just 21 days.
THE VANDALS
V
One of Rome’s biggest challenges
during the 4th and 5th
centuries was the
Vandals, a fierce
tribe of Aryan
barbarians who
had been slowly
but surely working
their way through
Spain and into
Africa. In AD 429
the Vandals arrived in Africa and began
demolishing much of what the Romans
had built. In 439, they seized Carthage,
which became the capital of a new
state that covered the area of present-
day Tunisia. Its founder, Genseric,
ruled for half a century (428–477)
building the Vandal empire and
expanding it further into Sicily, Sardinia
and Italy. He also had the audacity to

HRISTIANITY ARRIVED IN AFRICA from Rome and was
taken up by many people in Tunisia, including
some of the Berber tribes. Thousands of Christian
converts were martyred during the third century,
including St Perpetua who was thrown to the animals
in Carthage. A split in the church occurred in the 4th
century when Donatus, the Bishop of Carthage, refused
to recognize the authority of church leaders who had
failed to stand up to Rome. These “Donatists” built their
own churches and many Roman sites in Tunisia have
two churches for this reason.

Ruins of Basilicas
Many Tunisian towns contain the ruins of Christian
basilicas that were built in the town centres or on the
outskirts, often on the sites of earlier sacred buildings.

in North Africa. The

quashed the Berbers’ resistance and
confirmed Arab rule. The work of Ibn
Nooman was continued by Musa ibn
Nusair. Under his rule, Kairouan
gained independence from Egypt and
was controlled directly by Damascus.
Having conquered the coast of North
Africa, Ibn Nusair opened the gateway
to Europe. In 800, power in Ifriqiyya
passed to the hands of the
independent deputies of the Abassid
Caliphs – the Aghlabids. The founder
of this dynasty was Ibrahim ibn al-
Aghlab who made Kairouan the
capital of a region that covered
western Algeria, Tunisia and part of
Libya. The resulting dynasty proved to
be successful and

ARAB RULE
One hundred years after the death of
Mohammed (632), the Muslim Empire
stretched from Spain to India. The first
strong resistance encountered by the
Muslim army was in the area of
present-day Tunisia. The attacks on
Ifriqiyya (Tunisia and parts of Libya)
started immediately after the conquest
of Egypt (640–43); nevertheless it took
more than 20 years to win control
over it. This was finally achieved by
Oqba ibn Nafi after he defeated the
Byzantine army in 647. In 670, he
founded the city of Kairouan, which
became 
the 
most
important town in
North Africa and an
excellent base for
military 
operations
against the Berber
tribes. Oqba, who
according to a legend
went forward until the
Atlantic waves stopped
his horse, was killed
in 683 at the battle of
Basra in Iraq. After his
death, the Muslim
army was forced to leave Ifriqiyya and
it was only during 693–700 that the

an Arabic-speaking
Muslim state.
FATIMIDS
Towards the end of
the 9th century, the
main threat to the
Aghlabids came from
the increasingly strong opposition
movements centring around the Shiite
groups. One of the leaders of this
movement was Abu Abdullah who
claimed descent from the Prophet’s
daughter, Fatima. Abu Abdullah was a
gifted commander and in 909 the
Aghlabids were defeated. A little later
he conquered Alexandria. The
Fatimids constructed a new capital,
Mahdia, and set about making plans
to capture Egypt.
Abu Abdullah’s successors continued
this policy of expansion. Having
conquered Egypt, they handed control
of Ifriqiyya to their Berber nominee.
In 972, he founded the Zirid dynasty
(972–1152), 
which 
withdrew
allegiance from the Fatimids in 1041.
There followed a period of great
instability. 
The 
Zirids 
were
overthrown by the Almoravids, who
ruled the Maghreb and Spain from
1056 until 1147. They were followed
by the Almohads, who in their turn,
were replaced by the Hafsid dynasty. 
HAFSIDS
The Hafsids (1228–1574) introduced
wide-ranging changes beneficial to the
economy of present-day Tunisia. Their
great political skill enabled them to
play the Tunisian tribes off against
one another. This, and a reputation
for military skill,
which was partly
earned when they
defeated a crusade
led by Louis IX of
France, led to a time
of stability. Tunis
was 
made 
the
capital and did well
under 
the 
new
regime, enjoying a
new-found wealth.
Separate districts were allocated to
Muslim 
refugees 
from 
Spain,
European diplomats and merchants.
The Great Mosque (Jemaa el-Zitouna)
acquired a medersa and a minaret,
and a palace was built on the site of
the present Bardo Museum. At the
same time, the Great Mosque in
Kairouan was restored.
OTTOMAN RULE
It was the arrival of the Ottoman
Turks that spelt the end for the Hafsid
dynasty. The Ottomans had fought
wars with Byzantine Rome, which
they

defeated,

Turkey. Until 1574, the
Spanish kings tried to
establish a protectorate
over Tunisia, but were
defeated by the Turks,
on land and at sea. 
Tunisia became a
province of the Ottoman
Empire and was ruled
over by an elaborate
hierarchy which included
the Pasha (the sultan’s
representative) and an
elite of Ottoman high-
ranking army officials
including 
a 
civil
administrator (bey), and
a military administrator
(dey). Such a complex
sharing of power did 
not result in a stable
government 
and
rebellions and struggles for control
weakened the state. Central rule was
restored by the Muradids (1628–1702),
the first line of hereditary beys, who
brought about the country’s revival.
They also enriched its art with
Ottoman influences and popularized
the habit of coffee drinking.

During the 16th century, the dynasty
ruled over a powerful empire that
included the Balkans and Arab
countries. The golden era of the
Ottoman Empire coincided with
the rule of Suleyman the
Magnificent (1520–66). During
that time the Ottomans also
took control of Tunisia
with the help of
mercenaries. In the

appointed 
his
nephew, Ali, to be his
successor in 1709.
However, in the
same year a son,
Mehmed, 
was
born. When he
reached maturity,
his father made
Mehmed his heir
and gave him the
title of Bey Mahalli.
The nephew was given
the title of Pasha. This
situation led to five
years 
of 
conflict
during 
which
Tunisian society was split into two
camps, a division that lasted, in
political terms, well into the 18th
century. Initially Ali Pasha won the
upper hand, but the descendants of
Husayn bin Ali regained power with
support from Algeria. During the
second half of the 18th century, the
country was successively ruled by
three of his descendants including
Husayn’s two sons Ali Bey (1759–81)
and 
Hammouda 
Bey 
(Pasha)
(1781–1813). 
Under
their rule the country
prospered  for a brief
period but in 1819
Tunisia was forced to
put an end to piracy,
thus depriving it of
revenue. The country
ran up large debts and
taxes on agriculture and
trade were increased to
make 
up 
for 
the
shortfall. The economy
suffered and Tunisia
was forced to borrow
heavily from European
(mainly French) banks.
Tunisia’s fate was sealed
at the Berlin Congress
in 1878, which had
been called by the
Europeans 
to
decide how best
to carve up the
recently defeated
Ottoman Empire.
The country was
now bankrupt and it
was only a matter of
time before one power
or another stepped in.
In 1881, with the
spurious excuse that
they were protecting
French-occupied Algeria from raids
by Khroumirie tribesmen, France sent
30,000 troops across the border into
Tunisia from Algeria. The troops
swiftly took control first of Le Kef
and then of Tunis. The initial
opposition was intense but short-
lived and the same year the Treaty of
the Bardo, signed with Mohammed
el-Sadiq Bey, recognized the bey as
the nominal ruler with the proviso
that France was in ultimate control.

EARLY INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT
These blessings of civilization served
only the country’s elite, however. A
negative aspect was the purchase of
land by rich Europeans. As a result,
many Tunisian peasants
were forced out to the
poorer areas of the
country, and the traditional
way of life of stock-
keeping shepherds began
to disappear. At the same
time, some 60,000 Tunisian
troops fought in World
War I – 10,000 died. 
A struggle for independence 
was linked to growing national
awareness, which in turn was
brought about by better
education within Arab
society as a whole. One of
the 
fathers 
of 
Arab
nationalism was Jemeladdin
al-Afghani whose ideology
had a great influence on
Tunisian activists. Two of
the main architects of
Tunisia’s rebirth were
Kheiredine Pasha (d.1889)
and Sheikh Mohammed
Kabadu (d.1871), who
initiated a number of
reforms of the religious
tribunal and the Zitouna
THE COLONIAL ERA
The French had always attached great
importance to Maghreb – Tunisia,
Algeria and Morocco. The history of
their trade links, treaties and
agreements made with these
countries stretched back over three
hundred years prior to taking control. 
Tunisia’s loss of independence was
followed by reform of the central
government, which, while preserving
the Muslim administration with Sidi
Ali Bey at its head, placed it under
the control of the French civil service.
On assuming the protectorate, the
French made a number of key
investments. By 1914, they had built
oil refineries, schools and
hospitals and had also
embarked on the task of
extending the railway
network linking Tunis with
Algeria, and Sousse with
Sfax. 
In 
Tunis 
they
extended La Goulette
harbour and commenced
the rapid development of
the Ville Nouvelle (modern town) to
which they moved most of the major
government offices.

Kheiredine also founded the
Sadiki College in 1875, an
institution that was to play an
important role in the cultural
and intellectual life of Tunisia. 
The college produced many
of the later advocates of
modernization of the country,
as well as members of the
“Unbreakable Bonds” society,
founded in Tunis in 1885,
which co-operated with the
Egyptian reform movement. In
April 1885, the first public national
demonstration took place in Tunis,
organized by Mohammed as-Sanusi.
At that time the activists demanded
not so much independence as
permission for Muslims to have their
say in the running of the country.
The French authorities arrested the
leaders. The Tunisians were forced to
change their tactics and commenced
an intensive struggle through the
media, aimed in particular at the
urban population. 
Social unrest continued and the
year 1920 saw the foundation of the
Tunisian 
Constitutional 
Party,
commonly known as Destour. It
demanded a constitution, and access
to all state offices for Tunisians as
well as public education. Ten years
later, a new generation of activists
came to prominence. Among them
was a young lawyer, Habib
Bourguiba. He founded a newspaper,
L’Action Tunisienne, and used it to
launch a struggle against the
authorities. 
In March 1934, Bourguiba founded
the Neo-Destour Party with the main
aim of fighting for the country’s
independence. He drew massive
support and the French, sensing the
danger, declared the party illegal and
had Bourguiba arrested, though he
was later released. By 1938, however,
popular resistance to French rule 
had became widespread. Just before
the outbreak of World War II,
Bourguiba was arrested again, but by
the time the authorities had acted
against the nationalists the war had
already begun.

suffered heavy losses: Sfax and
Sousse were heavily damaged, while
other towns, such as Bizerte, Gab¯s
and Tunis suffered various degrees of
bombardment. Allied casualties
numbered some 15,000.
REGAINING OF INDEPENDENCE AND
THE BOURGUIBA REGIME
After the war, France tried to relieve
the political tensions persisting in
Tunisia. It abolished censorship and
installed a new Tunisian government
headed by Mustapha Kaakim. But the
most decisive change
in 
Paris’s 
attitude
towards 
Tunisian
independence occurred
only in 1954, when the
office of French prime
minister was taken
over by Pierre Mend¯s-
France – an advocate
of peaceful solutions to
France’s 
colonial
conflicts. The French
press published an
interview with the
WORLD WAR II
Tunisia’s proximity to Italy
suddenly 
had 
strategic
importance for both sides.
Despite aggressive German
propaganda and earlier French-
Tunisian 
tensions, 
the
Tunisians came out in support
of France and the Allies. The
Germans were supporting the
colonial ambitions of the
Italians in Libya and the
Italians, taking advantage of
the situation, were also trying
to gain control of Tunisia. In
June 1940, after declaring war
on Britain and France, Italy
bombed military targets in
Bizerte and around Tunis. German
forces landed in Tunisia in 1942
while Rommel’s Africa Korps
conducted a military campaign in the
south. The German authorities also
attempted to win Habib Bourguiba
over to their side, but met with his
firm refusal to co-operate.
It was not long before the Allies
were marching into the country,
however, and on 7 May 1943 Allied
Forces commanded by General
Patton and General Montgomery
liberated Tunisia. The country had

Bourguiba
became the country’s first
president and the leader of
the Neo-Destour Party,
which later restyled itself
and changed its name to
Parti Socialiste Destourien (PSD).
Before this, and immediately after
regaining independence, work began
on drafting a new constitution, which
finally came into force on 1 June
1959. Its preamble affirmed that
Tunisia was a free, independent and
sovereign state. Its religion was Islam
and Arabic was to be given priority
in schools and government offices. Its
political system was to be a free
republic. This same constitution
granted far-reaching powers to the
new president. 
BEN ALI
Despite a series of reforms and
increased prosperity from tourism,
there was much social unrest under
Bourguiba’s rule.
A general strike
was called in
1984 demanding
an 
end 
to
repression and a

laws.

President Bourguiba to give up the
presidency for life. Bourguiba
resigned in view of his advanced
years and poor health. Ben Ali
became president. He promised to
abolish life presidencies, introduced a
multi-party system, followed a policy
of economic liberalism and set up a
series of reforms which brought
about 
democracy 
and 
social
pluralism. In the 1994 and 1999
general elections, he was once again

The history of Tunis goes back
to the early days of Carthage
and it features on Roman maps
dating from the first Punic War.
Destroyed in 146 BC it was
half-heartedly rebuilt by the
Romans but remained a
place of little importance
until the arrival of the Arabs in
the 7th century. Believing it to
have a good defensive position,
Hassan ibn Nooman, who had just
ousted the Byzantines from Carthage,
decided to build here and sited the
medina on a bank of high ground
next to a salt lake. The most
significant work undertaken was the
Great Mosque in AD 732 and the city
served as the imperial capital during
the last years of Aghlabid rule. From
then on, Tunis was a major centre of
science, culture and religion
in North Africa. 
During the Hafsid era
(1228–1574), 
with 
trade
flourishing between Europe
and the East, it became an Arab
metropolis and by the 13th
century the Hafsids had
made it their capital. The
Ottoman Turks (1580–1705)
saw no reason to change this
and built heavy fortifications
round the city as well as a large
number of mosques and palaces. 
By the 19th century the population
was becoming too numerous to
remain inside the city walls and the
French drained some of the nearby
marshland to extend the city. The
new part features wide avenues and
some distinctly European architecture.
TUNIS
T
UNIS HAS A COMPACT CITY CENTRE making it easy to explore on
foot. There is plenty to see. The lively medina has fascinating
shops and markets as well as Islamic architecture dating
back a thousand years. The Bardo Museum contains the world’s
largest collection of Roman mosaics, while along Avenue Habib
Bourguiba there are continental-style cafés and restaurants. Just a
little way out of Tunis lies the ancient site of Carthage.

T
HE GREAT MOSQUE has been at the heart of
Tunis since it was begun in the 8th century
and towers over the souks that crowd around it.
Aptly named, its striking east gallery opens up
suddenly when proceeding up the final yards of
Rue Jemaa Zitouna. Though parts of the mosque
have been remodelled many times, its vast
courtyard of polished marble is in its original
form and is surrounded on three sides by

Souk et-Trouk 3
T
HIS 17TH-CENTURY Turkish
market is situated between
Souk el-Attarine (the scent
market) and Souk el-Berka
(formerly the site of the old
slave market). It contains the
north gateway to the Great
Mosque and also Au Palais
d’Orient – one of Tunis’s
best-known carpet shops and
viewing points. Here, visitors
will also find Café M. Rabet
with its miniature garden (a
kind of verandah) and a more
expensive restaurant on the
first floor (overlooking a
section of the Great Mosque).
This is the place to come to
enjoy some traditional
Tunisian music, a cup of tea
and, for those that want it, a
puff of tobacco through a
chicha (hookah).

medersas’ courtyards adjoin
the mosque. 
The oldest of them is the
Medersa of the Palm Tree
(1714). Its name derives from
the palm tree that stands at
the centre of the courtyard
surrounded by arcaded
galleries. The arcades, with
their horseshoe arches, have
columns with richly
ornamented capitals. The
Medersa of the Palm Tree
now houses the headquarters
of the organization concerned
with Koranic law. 
Bachia, the second in the
group, was built in 1752 by
Ali Pasha. Standing next to
the entrance is a small
fountain with miniature pools
that are always full of water.
The adjacent tourbet

Pasha, who built it in memory
of his son Suleyman who had
been murdered by his
younger brother.

The palace was built as a
guest house by a Husaynid
monarch in 1795, on the ruins
of a royal residence dating
from the Muradid period. It
was extensively remodelled in
1876 when it was used by the
Bey of Tunis as a place to
receive important visitors. It
was here that he received
many heads of state from
Germany, England, France
and the Ottoman Empire. 
The bey himself lived
outside Tunis in the Bardo
area at this time. Prior to that,
until the Husaynid period
(18th century), the sultan’s
main residence was the
nearby kasbah. The change
was partly brought about by
the fashion for building
summer residences that
prevailed at the beginning
of the 19th century.

The Great Souk 7
T
HE MEDINA IN
T
Tunis has
more than 20 souks. The
T
major ones are adjacent to the
Great Mosque and together
form one vast, colourful,
animated marketplace. Two
terms, both meaning
“market”, compete with each
other in the Muslim world:
the bazaar (from the Persian)
and the souk (from the
Arabic). For centuries a souk
had a distinct, cohesive
character based on the
traditions of the eastern and
Mediterranean nations, and
featured clearly identified
places for various types of
goods. From the beginning,
this was a venue for trading
in goods and
conducting financial
transactions, as well as
being the centre of
social life. Arab souks,
as opposed to
European markets,
were never places of
residence for the
merchants. The Great
Mosque was always
the seat of learning
and faith, while the
souks constituted the
town’s economic
centre. Souks may
seem chaotic but
actually have a strict
hierarchy. The
immediate vicinity of
the Great Mosque was
reserved for the up-
market bazaars selling
articles such as
religious books,
perfumes, carpets and
jewellery. In Muslim
countries, the market was, and
continues to be, an important
element of Islamic life. The
souk is a place where people
come to shop, trade and 
meet friends. According to
Muslim tradition, trading is
the sweetest occupation. 
The medieval Arab scholar 
al-Ghazali, for instance,
considered commerce as a
form of preparation for the
rewards of the next world.
Haggling is a strictly
scripted performance: both
parties must end up believing
that they have struck a good
bargain. Any customer who
engages in a long bargaining
process should not pull out of
the deal at the end (see p291).

Hammouda Pasha, one of the
early Ottoman rulers and the
founder of the Muradid
dynasty. The mosque was
completed in 1665, a year
before the monarch’s death,
and was lavishly decorated
by craftsmen from Italy. 
Two gates lead to the
mosque, which is easily
recognisable by its sandstone
walls. The main one is the
northern gate from Rue de la
Kasbah while the side
entrance is from Rue Sidi ben
Arous. Inside the mosque is a
courtyard surrounded with
arcades, which are towered
over by one of Tunis’s most
distinctive minarets – an
octagonal, Turkish-style
structure with black and
white arches. The minaret’s
balcony would originally
have been used by the
muezzin to call the faithful to
prayer, though this role has
now been replaced by using
loudspeakers.

HIS IS ONE of the medina’s
main streets (after Rue de
la Kasbah). There are plenty
of souvenir shops here but
the same souvenirs can be
bought much cheaper, and
without haggling, in the side-
streets or the souks in the
south or north of the medina.
The street runs steeply
upwards, from Place de la
Victoire and the Bab el-Bahr
gate to the Great Mosque
where the souks are some of
the oldest in Tunis. The place
is crowded and noisy from
morning until 6pm, except for
Ramadan, when it comes
alive only at dusk and
continues until 1 or 2am. The
shops that line the street on
both sides offer Nabeul

T
HE BAB EL-BAHR gate marks
the symbolic border
T
between the old quarter of
Tunis and the Ville Nouvelle
that was built by the French
during the colonial era. This
vast arch standing in Place de
la Victoire was once the east
gate in the wall that
encircled the medina and
would have been surrounded
by huts and stalls. 
Bab el-Bahr is the Arabic
for “the Sea Gate” and is so
named because of its close
proximity to the sea. In the
19th century, the waters of
Lake Tunis almost lapped up
against the walls of the
medina, though today its
shores are about 1.5 km
(1 mile) away. This is thanks
to the French who drained
much of the ground in order
to lay foundations for the
new town. As the Ville
Nouvelle prospered, the Bab
el-Bahr became a link
between two worlds and a
symbol of progress and of the
new era. During the French
protectorate, its name
changed to the French Gate
and only reverted to its old
name after Tunisia regained
independence. The present
gate was built in 1848 on the
orders of Ahmed Bey, who
was inspired by the Arc de
Triomphe and had the old
gate demolished. It stands at
the end of Avenue de France,
which leads to the harbour.

HAND OF FATIMA
The “Hand of Fatima” is a
common talisman that is
thought to ward off bad
luck. Many Muslims believe
that the hand has the power
to protect and bestow
blessings. Fatima was the
daughter of the Prophet
Mohammed. An idealized
mother and wife, the Fatimid
dynasty claimed descent
from her. The five fingers
symbolize not only the five
pillars of Islam, but also the
Muslim prayer that is
repeated five times a day.

T
HE KASBAH MOSQUE gets its
name from the fort that
stood above the medina during
the Hafsid reign. Badly
damaged during a revolt by
Turkish troops in 1811, only
the mosque and parts of the
wall running along Rue el-
Zouaoui have survived.
Protected by mighty walls,
the kasbah was once the
venue of the sultan’s council
gatherings and was where the
sultan held audiences.
Adjacent to the kasbah were
the army barracks and city
guard quarters. These were
used as the sultan’s residence
until Husaynid times (18th
century) and continued to
retain a military function.
During the time of the French
Protectorate, they were
occupied by French troops.
The barracks were eventually
demolished in 1957.
The mosque is well worth
visiting, if only to see its
minaret (the tallest in the
medina), which served as the
model for the Great Mosque’s

signalled by briefly flying a

related to the size
and grandeur of the

Almost every door in
this street is still
furnished with 
its traditional
doorknocker. Some
of the houses have
more than one knocker.
These used to indicate the
number of people who once

time when different sounding
“knocks” were used to signal
the identity and gender of
guests (men, women and
children each had different
doorknockers). One of the

THE CORSAIRS
The glamorous but violent
world of the corsairs
played a significant role in
shaping the history of
Tunisia from the mid-16th
century until the early
19th century. The most
notorious corsair was the
Turkish-born Khair ed-Din
Barbarossa (Red Beard),
who based himself on the
island of Jerba and in
1534 captured Tunis.
Under the Ottomans there
was great wealth to be
taken at sea and corsairs
flourished during the
Husaynid period as a
major Tunisian enterprise.
During the late 17th and
early 18th centuries some
maritime nations even
paid bribes to Tunisia so
that their ships would not
be attacked.
Richly ornamented interior of 
Sidi Mehrez Mosque
Barbarossa, once the most
notorious corsair in Tunisia
The whole building is topped
by a large white dome,
surrounded by four smaller
ones (also white). The
courtyard is surrounded on
three sides by arcades; and
the walls of the prayer hall
are richly ornamented. 
Opposite the entrance to
the mosque is the mausoleum
of Sidi Mehrez (also known
as Mehrez ibn Chalaf). The
tomb is revered by Muslims
and Jews alike. Sidi Mehrez
was famous for his tolerance
and won a number of
concessions for the Jews.
Thanks to him, those who
traded in the local souks
were granted the right to
settle within the city walls
and no longer had to leave 
the city at nightfall.
Visiting the palace offers a
unique insight into how the
wealthy lived in 19th-century
Tunis. The main door opens
up to the driba (entrance
hall), which was used by the
owner of the house to receive
visitors. The room to the right
of the entrance is the bayt-al-
sahra (evening room). During
the day, it was used by
teachers but in the evening it
became a venue for all-male
gatherings, which were
livened up by female dancers. 
Women also had their own
soirees. For these, the
servants would sprinkle the
carpets and pond with rose
and jasmine petals, fill the
censers with ambergris,
incense and aloe and arrange
cushions on the floor. After
the women had taken their
seats, a large tray would be
brought in, laden with sweets
and glasses of tea. 
Much of the decoration is
in keeping with this lavish
lifestyle. The wall containing
the door to the dar al-kebira
(state rooms) is lined with
pink sandstone while the
white stuccowork above the
door resembles intricate lace.
Look out for the arches
supported by Doric columns
that feature charming stucco
decorations. 
It is perhaps no surprise
that such a stunning palace is
now the home of the
Association de Sauvegarde de

the French in the early

example of Art Nouveau, with
distinctive white stucco, soft

fantastic carved figures. It is
still used as a theatre today
and is a good venue for
concerts of both classical and
Arabic music as well as films
and talks.

Avenue Habib
Bourguiba – one
of the finest streets
in the European
district of Tunis.
Art Nouveau houses, adorned with
stunning balconies are common on
Avenue de Paris, Rue ibn Khaldun
and Rue Charles de Gaulle.
Architecture inspired by Baroque and
Renaissance styles is the most prevalent in
Tunis’s modern town. Frequently, each
storey of a building is constructed in the
style of a different era. The extremely rich,
heavily ornamented fa˜ades are also
reminiscent of Islamic architecture.
The Oriental
style featuring
domes, arched
windows and
courtyards,
combines with
European
elements and
can be seen in
the buildings
around Place du
Gouvernement.
The colonial style is represented mainly by
apartment blocks and public buildings. These
were built in clusters in styles fashionable in
Europe during the late 19th century.

D
URING THE PERIOD of the French
Protectorate (1881–1956), the
population of Tunis began to move
beyond the walls of the medina. New
structures appeared and wealthy
Tunisians gave up the narrow
labyrinthine alleys of the medina for the
wide avenues and apartments of the
Ville Nouvelle. The building of the new
town coincided with the development
of Art Nouveau in France and Italy,
followed later by Art Deco. Perhaps no
other European style has merged so
successfully with Islamic architecture as
Art Nouveau. The arabesque, an
ornament typical of Islamic art, blended
perfectly with the curves and
undulating surfaces of Art Nouveau, as
did the Islamic taste for ornate
stuccowork and florid decorations.



Avenue Habib
Bourguiba k
T
HE MAIN STREET OF Tunis’s
Ville Nouvelle, Avenue
Habib Bourguiba runs like an
artery through the city linking
the harbour and TGM train
station with the medina.
Along the way it cuts through
Place du 7 Novembre 1987
(which commemorates the
day when Bourguiba was
replaced by Zine el-Abidine
ben Ali) and Place de
l’Indépendance. From here it
becomes Avenue de France.
About half way along, Place
du 7 Novembre has a
fountain and a prominent
clock tower decorated with
fine tracery. In the evenings
the illuminated clock and the
multicoloured fountain
become a popular meeting
places for the youth of Tunis. 
The section between here
and the cathedral is the
busiest part of this tree-lined
promenade and there are
plenty of smart cafés and
fashionable restaurants to
tempt visitors. Café de Paris,
situated near Hôtel Africa, is
the birthplace of the Ecole de
Tunis, founded in 1949,
which was an influential
group of Tunisian painters.
The café is still a popular
meeting place, although little
has remained of its artistic
atmosphere. Moving on
towards the medina, you pass

HIS HUGE MARKET hall is
situated not far from Bab
el-Bahr and is where many of
the residents of Tunis come
to do their weekly shopping.
Built during the colonial era,
it has a high-vaulted roof to
protect shoppers from the
rain or heat. A wide variety of
goods is on offer. Articles
include a large selection of
excellent cheeses, dozens of
varieties of the Tunisian
harissa (chilli and garlic
sauce), cooking oil,
vegetables, fruit, meat and
fish. On sale right by the
entrance are flowerpots
containing Tunisian
herbs and other
plants that include
varieties of jasmine,
bougainvillea, basil
and rosemary. A
large part of the
hall is occupied by
fruit and vegetable
vendors trying to
out-perform each
other in the hope 
of getting passers-
by to purchase their
products. Any
transaction may
involve haggling.
The market is worth
visiting if only to
witness these
scenes of everyday
Tunisian life.

there is an artificial lake. 
Standing at the heart of the
park, on a hill, is a lovely
koubba or pavilion. Once part
of Hammouda Pasha’s rose
garden, it was placed here to
serve as a resting place and
viewpoint. It is an excellent
example of Tunisian
architecture. Its decoration
tastefully combines a variety
of styles – Italian white
marble columns, Doric
capitals, Moorish-Spanish
ceramics and stuccoes, and
Tunisian earthenware.
Belvedere’s grounds also
include a former casino.
Originally converted into an
officers’ club, it has since
become a museum of modern
art and cinema. The museum
also has two summer theatres
and occasionally serves as a
concert venue.

ELVEDERE PARK IS located to
the north of the medina,
on the slope of a hill standing
some 2 km (1 mile) from the
end of Avenue Habib
Bourguiba. Outside rush hour
it is possible to get there by
TGM train (the Tunisians refer 
to it as the metro) from
République (get off at
Palestine then walk).
This is Tunis’s only major
park and provides an
opportunity to escape from
the busy and somewhat
cramped streets and alleys of
the medina. The park was
established in 1892 by
Josepha de Laforcade, a
landscape artist and one of
Paris’s top gardeners. Initially
it was closed to the public
(due to construction works
and the natural plant growth
cycle) and the official
opening did not take place
until 1910. 
To this day it remains the
biggest park in Tunis, and the
favourite place for family
outings, receptions and
Sunday picnics. At the last
count, it had over 230,000
trees and 80 species of plants
including olive trees, pines
and numerous varieties of
cacti. The park also plays an
important educational role. 
A visit to the Friends of Park
Belvedere Park, which has a
small office on the high
ground near the park’s
entrance will provide
information on the many
plants growing in the garden,
and also on Tunisia’s flora
and fauna in general. Close to
this is the Centre
d’Animation Équestre,
which organizes pony-
trekking. A little higher up is
a fairly gentle assault course.
There is also a zoo in the
southern section of the park
which has a number of birds
and animals native to Africa.
The zoo has a small
admission charge and attracts
over a million visitors a year.
If visiting the zoo, look out
for the Midha, a 17th-century
ablutions room that was

is the largest in Tunis. Visiting
the graves of one’s relatives is
considered a duty, especially
during Aïd el-Fitr, at the end
of Ramadan. At this time the
cemetery is visited by family
groups, who clean and
whitewash the tombs, which
are all arranged to face
towards Mecca. The first mass
demonstrations against French
rule took place here in 1911,
costing the lives of 30
Tunisians and nine French-
men in the riot that ensued.

GREATER TUNIS
AND CAP BON PENINSULA
T
HE COASTAL SUBURBS JUST EAST OF TUNIS, including La Goulette,
Carthage and Sidi Bou Saïd, provide an alternative to the bustle
of the city. Drawn by cooling sea breezes, many locals visit this
area on hot summer evenings. Further east is the Cap Bon peninsula. A
major agricultural region since Carthaginian times, Cap Bon has some
fine beaches and has become one of Tunisia’s main resort areas.
Striking white minaret of a mosque in Sidi Bou Saïd

Poking out like a finger into the
Mediterranean Sea, the Cap Bon
peninsula is a mere 140 km (87
miles) from Sicily. Some
geologists believe that it may
once have provided a link
between Africa and Europe
until rising sea levels cut it off
some 30,000 years ago. A
range of mountains divides the
peninsula lengthways into its
eastern and western portions. The
east coast, with its fine beaches and
historic ruins, is mostly given up to
resorts such as Hammamet and
Nabeul while the west coast is more
rugged and less frequently visited.
Cap Bon is also one of the country’s
major industrial regions. La Goulette
is a major port, and handles frequent
passenger traffic from Europe. 
The Carthaginians made the
most of the fertile soil and by
the time the Romans settled
here the cape resembled a
spectacular garden, and was
named the Beautiful Cape or
Cap Bon. When the French
arrived in the 19th century
they planted huge citrus
groves and vineyards.
Even today, many farms
thrive and, thanks to a high level
of rainfall and efficient irrigation
systems, Cap Bon provides the
country with 80 per cent of its citrus
fruit crop, 60 per cent of its grapes
and almost half of its vegetables. Most
Tunisian wines are also produced in
this area, especially around the town
of Grombalia, which has an annual
wine festival in September.

PAUL KLEE IN TUNISIA
“Colour has taken possession
of me. Colour and I are one. I
am a painter.” So wrote Paul
Klee (1879–1940), the Swiss-
born painter associated with
Bauhaus, during his visit to
Tunisia in 1912–14. Klee was
taken aback by the festive
colours he encountered in
Tunis, Sidi Bou Saïd and
Kairouan and his works from
that period, such as those built
up of coloured squares, were
clearly influenced by the
mosaics and arabesques that
he so admired. His Tunisian-
inspired paintings include
Sunrise over Tunis and 
Camels and Donkeys.

A MARSA WAS once a district
of Punic Carthage, and
known as Megara. In the 7th
century it became a port –
Marsa er-Rum. Today, it is
known for its beaches and is
the favourite weekend
playground for Tunis’s
residents. It is easy to get to
by TGM train (from the end
of Avenue Bourguiba in
Tunis); the journey takes half
an hour. It is worth stopping
for a while at Café Saf-Saf at
Place Saf-Saf, to enjoy a
snack, a glass of mint tea or a
Turkish coffee. Look out for
the well on the terrace which
dates back to the Hafsid
period. Sometimes a camel
working the well’s wheel can
be seen.

Paul Klee
In the late 19th century, the
Bey of Tunis built his
residence here (Abdallia
Palace). In order to make it
possible for the ladies of the
court to bathe discreetly, the
palace was fitted with a
specially constructed wooden
terrace that rested on pillars
over the sea. Openings were
built into the floor that
allowed the women to get in
and out of the water well
away from prying eyes.
The town has some good
beaches and is a popular
place. Looking from the
beach towards the town,
there are a number of small
white houses standing on
hillsides, hidden amid
greenery. The smart, tastefully
designed hotels all have
direct access to the sea. With
Sidi Bou Saïd and Tunis just a
short train ride away, La
Marsa makes a good base for
a Tunisian holiday.

HE SMART SEASIDE resort of
Gammarth is an upmarket
place, with expensive hotels,
magnificent beaches and lush
greenery. In the past this was
just a small fishing village
nestled beneath cliffs.
Holidaymakers have been
visiting here since the 1950s
and now tourism is the main
source of the town’s income.
As well as the many four- and
five-star hotels and some
good restaurants, the town
has some lovely private villas,
hidden away in the hills.
Small sandy coves provide
ideal conditions for swimming
and most water sports. The
town itself is small and its
activities are firmly aimed at
the holiday trade. During the
high season, when it can
become very busy, its narrow
streets fill with boisterous
visitors and those in the know
often head a little way north
in search of more remote and
emptier beaches.

BLUE DOORS
It was Baron d’Erlanger
who gave Sidi Bou Saïd
its blue and white colour
scheme. The scores of
blue doors in the village
are only superficially
identical. In reality, they
differ from each other in
terms of size and their
ornamentation. The most
popular motifs include
moon crescents, stars and
minarets. Blue and white
dominate the streets and
courtyards. The white
walls provide a striking
background for the deep
blue shutters, ornate
window grilles and
colourful doorways.

P
ERCHED ON TOP of high
cliffs, Sidi Bou Saïd enjoys
a commanding view over the
Gulf of Tunis. It is named
after Sidi Bou Saïd, a 13th-
century Sufi holy man
(1156–1231), who settled here
on the return journey from
his pilgrimage to Mecca.
From then on, the village
(known at the time as Jabal
el-Menar) became a centre of
Sufism, and attracted pilgrims
from all over the country. The
area around his tomb became
the burial ground for other
Sufis. Although there are no
longer processions heading to
the tomb of Sidi Bou Saïd,
the grave and its adjacent
small mosque are still visited
by the Muslim faithful. It is
Sidi Bou Saïd’s panorama, seen from the south 
accessed via the narrow
stairs, right behind Café des
Nattes (see below).
In the early 18th century,
Hassan ibn Ali Bey ordered a
mosque to be built here,
which was entered via a
magnificent gate and
stairway. Today, the stairway
and entrance to Café des
Nattes stand on exactly the
same spot. In the 19th
century Mahmoud Bey built
his summer residence here.
Soon afterwards, the charms
of this pretty town, with its
cobbled streets and narrow
alleyways, were discovered
by the wealthy residents of
Tunis who came here hoping
to escape the summer heat.
The Café des Nattes is the
village’s hot spot and was the
favourite haunt of the 1920s
avant-garde artists who came
here. It remains highly
popular to this day
and a traditional glass
of mint tea with pine
kernels can still be
enjoyed. During the
day the café can get
busy as tour buses
stop off to explore
the town. Early in the
morning and later at
night, it is a much
quieter place and is
taken over by locals
who sit quietly
reading their
newspapers. The
café’s decor has not
changed in years and
the yellowed
photographs lining
the walls bear witness
to its famous guests
including Simone de
Beauvoir, André Gide
and Jean-Paul Sartre. But, as
the present owner of the café
says, “The foreigners were
only passing through here.
They came and they went.
But to our family, this place
has always been a symbol of
continuity and tradition.”
Since the days when Paul
Klee visited, the village has
grown in size and beauty. 
Its smart streets are full of
flowers; the freshly
whitewashed walls reflect the
strong midday light. Yet it
remains an artists’ village, full
of galleries and studios, while
the former palace of Baron
d’Erlanger (now the Centre of
Arab and Mediterranean
Music) stages concerts of
malouf music (see opposite).

alleyways. The hum ceases
and the women, shrouded in
white veils, disappear behind
the houses’ blue doors. It is
only along the steep, main
street of the village that
shopkeepers remain open,
waiting for holidaymakers to
whom they offer Bedouin
jewellery, intricate scent
boxes and aromatic oils. Heat
permitting, this can be a good
time to explore the cobbled
streets and alleys of Sidi Bou.
The pretty, whitewashed
houses rise and fall in line
with the cobbled streets that
climb the ridge of the hill.
Their white walls are covered
with purple bougainvillea and
their gates are garlanded with
scented jasmine. 
A number of Sidi Bou’s
mansions are open to visitors.
One of these is Dar el-Annabi
at 18 Rue Docteur Habib
Thameur, just off Place 7
Novembre. Several of the 55
rooms of this 300-year-old
house are open to the public
and a terrace offers
magnificent views of
the town and the
gulf beyond.
Not far from Café
des Nattes, the
street turns into a
promenade with an
amazing view over
the bay. From here
head for the
magnificently 
sited Café Sidi
Chabaane. The
zaouia (tomb) built
here in 1870 is associated
with Sidi Sheb’an – a mystic,
poet and musician. Today, his
tomb stands almost on the
site of the café. Standing
here, and looking in the
direction of the sea, it is easy
to see how much has
remained from bygone days.
It is also worth visiting the
fishing harbour and the
yacht marina. From here the
whole village can be seen
resting on the slope of a hill,
amidst lush greenery. 
Another place to look out
for is Dar Ennejma Ezzahra, a
former palace which now
houses the Centre of Arab
and Mediterranean Music.
It was built between 1912–22
for Baron Rodolphe
d’Erlanger, a member of a
rare recordings of
Arab music. 
An enthusiastic
musicologist, the
Baron was a major
force behind the
first Congress of
Arab Music, which
was held in Cairo
in 1932 and it is
possible to hear
wonderful concerts
of rare Arab music
performed here.
The Baron’s tomb
stands in the park
that surrounds the
palace.
Sidi Bou Saïd is
easily reached by
TGM train, which
runs between Tunis
and La Marsa. On
leaving the small
station, follow the
road uphill and the
street leads to Café des
Nattes. Alternatively, climb up
through the small, beautifully
kept park on the right-hand
side of the street that leads
up to the village centre. 
Most visitors stop here just
for a few hours, but in order
to soak up the atmosphere of
the place it is well worth
spending a night here. An
overnight stay allows time to
attend a concert of malouf
music in the evening, and in
the morning enjoy a drink of
strong mint tea on the terrace
of Café des Nattes.

BIRDCAGES
Sidi Bou Saïd is famous for its
beautiful birdcages. Made of
wire and often painted white,
they look like miniature
mausoleums. The design of
the birdcages resembles the
curved window grilles found
in the wooden shutters of
traditional Arab houses.
Tunisians are fond of pet
birds, particularly canaries.
Empty cages can often be
seen in hotel reception areas,
serving as decorations or as
mailboxes for residents’ letters
and postcards.

Still Life with Fish by Dhahak is proof
that Tunisian artists are also skilled in
the use of engraving techniques. This
lithograph clearly shows the influence of
modernist European artists.

person but also her
emotions. In the
context of Tunisian

A
MONG TUNISIAN ARTISTS, Sidi Bou
Saïd enjoyed a reputation as an
“artist’s village” long before the
arrival of the European painters,
but it was the latter who made it
world-famous. Enchanted with
the place, artists such as Paul
Klee, August Macke and Louis
Moillet usually stayed much
longer than they originally
planned. The Tunisian light
transformed their painting. In
the works of Paul Klee, for
instance, brown and
black graphics gave way
to vivid colours. The arrival
of European artists was to have
a significant effect on Tunisian
painting, and prompted the
emergence of a salon that
included European, Muslim and
Jewish artists. Out of this grew the
École de Tunis which took Tunisian
g
daily life as its subject matter
and included paintings of
cafés, markets and hammams.

A GOULETTE – an old fort 
and the harbour for Tunis
– lies a short distance from
the capital. The town was first
developed as a port and
strategic outpost by the Arabs
in the 7th century after they
had captured Tunis. In the
16th century it was a
stronghold for pirates who
were allowed to stay here by
the Hafsid sultan, Mohammed
V, who feared an attack by
the Spanish. The attack duly
came and the pirates proved
to be no match for the
Spanish forces. In 1535 the
Spanish King Charles V built 
a fort here. The fort was later
destroyed and in its place
the Ottomans built a massive
kasbah, which remains to
this day.
La Goulette began to grow
rapidly in the 17th century,
due to the construction of the
harbour. Led by Dutch
engineers, the development
included the canal, the basin
and the arsenal. The numbers
of Europeans living in the
town gradually increased
from year to year. During the
French Protectorate, the
kasbah was used as a
temporary prison. The name
La Goulette – “the gullet” or
“throat” that separates the sea
from Lake Tunis – dates from
those days. 
Today La Goulette (along
with Mahdia, Sfax, Kelibia,
Tabarka and Bizerte) is a
major fishing port and the
coastal section of Tunis
harbour. Here, fishermen can
be seen returning with their
catch. Nearly half of them still
use traditional rowing boats.
The country’s long
shoreline (over 1,300 km/800
miles) means that fishing still
plays an important part in
Tunisia’s economy. Many of
La Goulette’s fishermen can
be seen in the evenings,
heading out to sea where
they fish at night with lights,
returning in the morning in
time to deliver their valuable
catch to the town’s restaurants
and markets. 
Many Tunis residents come
here to enjoy fish and
seafood in one of the local
restaurants as La Goulette is
reputed to have the best fish
restaurants in Tunisia.
Depending on the season,
fresh gilthead, bream or tuna
are excellent.
La Goulette is also a major
passenger port – almost all
ferries going to Italy and
France set off from here.
At one time La Goulette
was also renowned for its
tolerance. This is vividly
illustrated by the 1995 Franco-
Tunisian comedy Un été ∫ la
Goulette, which is set in 1960.
The film tells the
story of three
teenage girls – one
Christian, one
Jewish and one
Muslim – who
decide to undergo
their sexual
initiation, each with
a boy of a different
faith. The girls’ plan
becomes public
knowledge and
causes a temporary
upset in the staid
life of the village.
La Goulette can be reached in
less than ten minutes by TGM
train from Tunis. The best
time to visit the village is in
the late afternoon or evening,
on the way back from La
Marsa’s beach or a trip to
Carthage. There is a beach
near La Goulette, but in view
of the harbour’s proximity
and the resulting pollution, it
is better to swim elsewhere.

I
N THE 9TH CENTURY, the Arabs
dug a canal about 10 km (6
miles) long to link Tunis with
the sea. This created the
artificial Lake Tunis. The
widening of its mouth allowed
two harbours to be built –
one on each side of the canal.
The lake – not particularly
picturesque in itself – is now a
brackish lagoon attracting
various species of bird,
including seagulls, white and
grey heron, and, during the
winter months – flocks of
flamingoes and cormorants.
The lake can be crossed by
TGM train (Tunis-La Goulette-
La Marsa) or by car.



Exploring Carthage
Carthage Museum stands on
Byrsa Hill, right next to the
Cathedral of St Louis. To the
north of the museum, close
by, is the 2nd-century Theatre
of Hadrian, which stages
performances in summer
during the International
Cultural Festival. Sights that
should not be missed include
the ruins of the Roman
amphitheatre, the remains of
RF Cathedral of St Louis 
Byrsa Hill. § (71) 733 866. 
# daily: 7:30am–7pm (summer);
9am–5pm (winter). &
The cathedral was built in
1890 by Cardinal Lavigerie. It
was dedicated to the French
King Louis IX who died of
the plague while laying siege
to Carthage in 1270. Cardinal
Lavigerie was an enterprising
person – he founded the
Order of the White Fathers,
which was active throughout
Africa. Its nuns and monks
proved to be outstanding
archaeologists and were the
first to begin investigations
into Tunisia’s past. Lavigerie
was also responsible for
resurrecting the Carthage
bishopric. 
The building has not served
as a place of worship since
1964 and was rebranded in
the 1990s as the Acropolium
de Byrsa. It is now used as a
venue for classical concerts
and exhibitions.

CATTERED RUINS are all that remain of one of the most
powerful cities of the ancient world. Carthage was
founded in 814 BC by Phoenician colonizers. By the 4th
century BC it had become the major force in this part of
the Mediterranean. The Punic wars led to the
destruction of the city although it rose again under
Roman rule. It was subsequently conquered by the
Vandals, who were replaced by the Byzantines in the
6th century. Following its capture by the Arabs in AD
695, Carthage gradually fell into ruins.
T Byrsa Hill
Climbing to the top of Byrsa
Hill affords a magnificent
view of the area and makes
this a good place to begin a
visit to Carthage. Under Punic
rule it was the heart of the
city and had a temple
dedicated to the Carthaginian
god Eschmoun. The Romans,
after razing Carthage to the
ground, levelled the top of
the hill to accommodate their
capitol and forum. In the
process they buried some
the Roman villas, and the
ruins of the Basilica of St
Cyprian. From here, a road
leads to the best-preserved
fragment of Carthage – the
Antonine Baths. In summer,
there is a horse-drawn
carriage that tours the main
sites. It can be hired near
Carthage Hannibal station.
The trip lasts two hours and
the price should be settled
in advance.
HANNIBAL (247–182 BC) 
Hannibal was one of the greatest military
commanders of the ancient world. In the
course of the Second Punic War he
embarked upon a long and arduous march
across the Pyrenees, southern Gaul and the
Alps. Although his army was not large, it
was exceptionally well trained.
Following his legendary crossing of
the Alps, Hannibal took on the
might of the Roman army. Despite
early successes, the Carthaginians
were eventually defeated and
made to pay huge reparations. At
home, an attempt to introduce
democratic reforms brought Hannibal into
opposition with the ruling classes and he
was forced to flee Carthage. Unable to
reconcile himself to the loss of his
homeland, he committed suicide.

own local community. He
died a martyr’s death during
the persecution of Christians
under Emperor Valerian’s
rule, in AD 258.
This Byzantine basilica that
bears his name was probably
the initial resting-place of the
saint, though that is open to
dispute. Situated at the north

Troy after its destruction by the Greeks and set sail with a

Troy in Italy. He was shipwrecked off Carthage and taken in
by the Phoenician Princess Dido. Soon they fell passionately

gods, Aeneas left to
fulfil his destiny and
began a series of
adventures that
ended with the

been the main act of this
ancient Phoenician cult and
this is the oldest surviving site
of its kind in Carthage.
Although no-one knows for
certain, it is believed that
offerings were made of
animals, people (often
foreigners and enemies), and
most of all children. They
were sacrificed to the goddess
(originally the offerings were
made to Baal Hammon, and
only later to Tanit). According
to some theories, the children
were laid in the arms of a
bronze statue, from where
they fell into the flames. The
parents were not allowed to
cry, as their grief was believed
to diminish the sacrifice.
When Agathocles defeated
the Carthaginians in 310 BC,
the town citizens reputedly
sacrificed 300 children in order
to appease the gods. 
The oldest part of the
Tophet includes the tiny
Cintas shrine with a small
niche carved into the rock
where some 8th-century pots
were found. In front of the
building is a courtyard with an
altar and three concentric
walls forming a kind of
labyrinth through which
everyone wishing to enter the
sanctuary had to pass.

T
HE PHOENICIANS were great
explorers and during the
early years of the first
millennium BC they ventured
as far as Spain and into the
Atlantic, 
establishing 
a
number of colonies including
the one at Carthage. The
Phoenicians brought with
them a culture based on a
blend of Egyptian, Anatolian, Greek
and Mesopotamian influences. One of 
their greatest contributions was the
alphabet, which was adapted by
the Greeks, and spread with
the rise of the Roman Empire.
The Phoenicians were also
skilled in carving, metalwork,
sculpture and jewellery. Many
Phoenician remains were
found at Carthage, and
excavations carried out in
Kairouan also reveal Punic
houses containing well-preserved
mosaics. Phoenician tombs have also
been found in Cap Bon and in Utica.

Phoenician cemeteries show
that the Phoenicians and their
Punic descendants believed in
an afterlife. Embalmed bodies,
elaborate sarcophagi and
inscriptions warning against
disturbing the dead indicate just
how strong this belief was.
The Punic alphabet, with its
t
elongated, gently curving letters,
was widely used in Carthage
and throughout the western
Phoenician colonies.
Terracotta female figures were first produced around
the 6th century BC. They may have been inspired by
Egyptian art as figures unearthed at Carthage resemble
those found on Egyptian sarcophagi. The use of masks in
religious ceremonies was also widespread in Carthage.
Altars in the form of shrines
(cippi) gave way in the 5th
century BC to steles, with
triangular tops. These often bear
an engraved motif of a moon
crescent or a stylized figure.
Necklaces made of glass
compound were popular
adornments. Jewellery played
an important role in
Carthage. Miniature
masks, amulets, scarabs
and golden plates were often
added to necklaces.

HIS FORMER
T
Berber
settlement is one of the
oldest Roman colonies in
Africa, and was founded
during the reign of Octavian
Augustus. The modern-day
ruins of Roman Uthina (now
called Oudna) divide into
two main sections.
Immediately by the entrance
stands a complex of
buildings, some of which
have been reconstructed,
including Roman villas,
private and public baths,
cisterns, a theatre and a 2nd-
century amphitheatre. The
second part, which includes
the capitol, has been largely
unexcavated and lies a few
hundred yards away,
adjoining a small village and
the remains of the colonial
buildings. This part of Oudna
can be visited free of charge.
Founded at the beginning
of the 1st century AD, Uthina
was a typical Roman town
and attracted wealthy
veterans from the Roman
army. The hub of its public
life was the market square
(forum), which was
surrounded by the town’s
most important buildings
including the capitol (the seat
of the local authorities), a
courthouse and the
marketplace. One of the
corners of the forum was
usually adjoined by a smaller
market square, known as the
macellum.
Oudna (Uthina), one of the oldest Roman colonies in Africa
The most valuable mosaics,
including one depicting
Venus bathing, are now on
display in the Bardo Museum. 
ENVIRONS: Before reaching
Oudna, it is worth stopping in
Mohammedia to see the
ruins of the Palace of Ahmed
Bey (1837–56) which was
intended to rival Versailles in
its grandeur. About 2 km 
(1 mile) from the village, 
running parallel to the
Tunis–Zaghouan road, are the
remains of a Roman aqueduct
that once carried water to
Carthage.
In the late 19th century,
Korbous was developed by
the French, while Ahmed Bey
founded a spa resort here in
1901. Korbous is today
Tunisia’s main health resort
and many of the local hotels
and sanatoriums offer water
and steam treatments to
elderly Tunisians. The natural
hot springs bubble up out of
the ground at about 44–60° C
(112–140° F) and contain high
levels of sulphur.
Korbous is an unassuming
place though there are now
plans to convert this hitherto
quiet resort into a large spa,
with a marina and luxury
hotels. The main attraction of
the town is the hammam
(bath), located in the former
bey’s palace.
Public bathing played a
prominent role in the life of
the Roman towns in North
Africa. The custom of using
alternate hot and cold baths,
borrowed from the Greeks,
assumed great importance in
Rome and its dominions. Bath
complexes were the centre of
town life and often included
playing fields, libraries and
relaxation rooms with mosaic
floors and frescoes. Wealthy
people sometimes spent
whole days in the
baths – resting 
and enjoying
discussions. 
The local waters
are thought to be
good for curing
arthritis and
beneficial in cases
of gastric ailments.
One famous
landmark to look
out for in Korbous
is the Zarziha
Rock, which can
be found near the presidential
palace. According to legend,
it is supposed to cure
infertility. The edges of the
stone have been polished
smooth by the hands of those
seeking help.
Not much remains here of
the old buildings. The fortress
that towers over the town
dates back to the Roman
period. A hot spring, Aïn el-
Atrous, can be found a short
way north of town. Here

HIS FISHING VILLAGE located
on the peninsula’s
headland, opposite the island
of Zembra, is famous for tuna
fishing. To this day the locals
use an old-fashioned method
known as Matanza that dates
back to Roman times. This
technique employs a huge net
containing a series of
chambers of decreasing sizes
which is laid some 4 km (2
miles) out to sea. The fish are
caught and swim from
chamber to chamber until they
all reach the smallest one. The
net is closed and dragged to
the surface. The fishermen
then jump into the nets and
set about the tuna with clubs,
knives and harpoons. The
Matanza takes place in May
and June during the spawning
season. For the rest of the
year the village is quiet.

FALCONRY
Hunting with falcons has
always been a favourite
pastime of Arab kings and
princes. Even today,
falconry enjoys great
popularity. Its main centre
in Tunisia is El-Haouaria.
In March, young peregrine
falcons are caught in nets.
Only the female birds are
kept, because they are
bigger and more predatory.
These are then trained for a
special falconry festival that
takes place in June. After
this, most of the birds are
set free to resume their

Cap Bon q
Road map D1, D2.
A
SHORT WAY from Europe
and within easy reach of
Carthage, Cap Bon has long
had an economic importance.
Its main ports were once
used as harbours for
Phoenician ships, while the
fertile coastal areas supported
agriculture. Here, the
Phoenicians cultivated cereals
and grapes from which they
produced wine. The Romans
continued these traditions
and it was only the Arab
conquest that put an end to
wine production. Under
French rule, the Cap Bon
peninsula was revived once
again when it became an
important area of European
settlement. More vineyards
were planted at this time,
along with huge citrus groves.
Although tourism plays an
increasingly important role,
especially around the
beaches of Hammamet and
Nabeul, the production of
vegetables and fruit still
provides the main source of
income. For this reason, the
peninsula has preserved a
quiet, rural character,
particularly inland. In the
small village of Soliman for
instance, with its beds of
spinach, beans and potatoes,
time seems to have ground to
a halt. In Menzel Bou Zelfa,
orange and lemon groves fill
the spring air with the heady
scent of blossom.
On the east coast, Kelibia
and Menzel Temime are
famous for their colourful
markets while the busy resort
town of Nabeul is known for
Kerkouane and its ruins of a Punic town
Most impressive of all are the
houses’ baths, with their well-
preserved floors, walls and
sanitary equipment. Many of
the houses have their own
bath, suggesting that the
owners liked to bathe in private. 
Very little is known about
this town and it was named
Kerkouane by the French
GODDESS TANIT
From the 5th century
onwards, the goddess
Tanit occupied the
highest position in the
pantheon of the Punic
gods. Associated with the
cult of fertility, she was
believed to be the
personification of both
the sun and the moon.
Sometimes she is depicted
by a crescent moon
turned upside down and
joined onto the disc of the
sun. At other times, her
image is formed from a
triangle, a horizontal line
and a circle.

ERKOUANE IS situated on
the high cliffs of Cap
Bon. Between the 4th and the
2nd century BC this was a
Punic town with a population
of 2,000 and was controlled
by Carthage. The Second
Punic War put an end to the
town’s existence when it was
abandoned. The town was
rediscovered in 1952 by a
French archaeologist.
Kerkouane has been
remarkably well preserved
and, from the remaining
foundations, it is easy to see
the checkerboard layout of the
streets. Little was known
about Punic architecture
before the discovery of
Kerkouane, but from the size
of the houses and the wide
streets, it is apparent that the
town’s inhabitants were not
only sophisticated but also
had a high standard of living.

Just along the coast
from Nabeul is

west coast runs inland
where the scattered
villages are isolated

from Korbous, which
is renowned for its
hot springs.

ET AT THE VERY TIP of Cap
Bon, on its eastern side,
this small town gives the
impression of being fully
surrounded by water. It dates
back to Punic times (being
for a while a trading outpost
of Syracuse); as well as to the
Roman Empire (as the Roman
settlement of Clupea).
Its history resembles that of
many other Punic hamlets in
that it began life as a Berber
settlement. Conquered by
Agathocles in 310 BC, and by
Regulus in 256 BC, it suffered
devastating damage in the
course of the Third Punic
War, when the Romans
nearly demolished it. Almost
nothing remains from Punic
and Roman times. The only
relic that has survived is the
late 6th-century Byzantine
fortress. The lighthouse,
dating from the early years of
Arab rule, now houses a
meteorological station and
provides a magnificent
panoramic view of the
surrounding country. Kelibia
is also known for its white
wines, particularly the dry
muscat.
The town’s main sight is the
old fort that overlooks the
harbour. The present building
was erected by the Byzantines
in the 6th century AD and
was further modified by the
Spanish and the Turkish. The
gun emplacements were laid
here by German forces during
World War II.

URING THE PERIOD of the
Roman Empire, the
wealth of this area was based
almost entirely on the
cultivation of cereals and
olives, vineyards and fig
orchards. Vast country estates
brought great fortunes to their
owners. It was here that the
new colonial system was first
introduced. It involved an
annual tax, paid in kind – in
the form of grain and oil –
that was levied on large
estates and used to feed the
Roman populace.
Located a short way from
Kelibia, Menzel Temime is
known for its spices, the
strings of sun-dried red
peppers, and above all
for its huge Tuesday
market where farmers
from the entire
peninsula congregate.

rainfall its area grows to
include the surrounding
marshes. During the high
season, the lake may attract
over a quarter of a million
birds. Unfortunately, in recent
years low water levels have
caused the number of birds
to decrease. Species still seen
include heron and flamingo.
The area around the lake is
also visited by many species
of birds that inhabit dry and
desert areas. The best view 
of the lake is from its north-
eastern end, from the road

From the artifacts that have
been found here, it is
probable that much of

based on the production of a

known as Tyrian purple (after

Nabeul’s mosque, hidden by
the souk’s arcades, is a typical
example of sacral Islamic
architecture. Its layout includes
a courtyard and a large prayer
hall decorated with some
magnificent ceramic tiles and
crystal chandeliers. Its green-
white minaret is reminiscent 
of the mosque in Kairouan.
Avenue Habib Bourguiba
Avenue Bourguiba, lined with
palm trees and oleanders, is
the town’s swankiest street. It
starts at the town centre and
runs towards the sea,
reaching the local beaches. It
is over 2 km (1 mile) long.
Along it are situated the

is full of shops. Heading

Punic town was destroyed by the Romans.
Later on, Julius Caesar established a
colony here, the ruins of which were
accidentally discovered in 1964 during the
construction of the first tourist hotel in

town centred around the ksar (fortified granary).
Today, this is the town’s oldest district.
Avenue Habib Thameur 
Avenue Habib Thameur,
whose continuation is
Avenue Farhat Hached, runs
in the direction of the souk

with Avenue Hedi Chaker, it
forms the town’s commercial
centre and is crammed with
workshops and small shops
selling ceramics. The heart of
the town is Place du 7
Novembre, at the junction of
Avenue Habib Thameur and
Avenue Habib Bourguiba.
The vast clay jug vessel here
is meant to symbolize
Nabeul’s pottery traditions.
Ceramic bric-a-brac, such as
ashtrays, small jars and plates
can be bought fairly cheaply.
Even larger plates or a
beautifully decorated dish
cost just a few dinars.
Although Nabeul is famous
mainly for its pottery, it has
also developed other forms of
craft, including embroidery,
wickerwork (straw mats) and
stone carving. Nabeul
embroidery is white or light
blue and uses cotton or silk
yarns. At one time it was
used only on women’s
clothes but now it can also be
found decorating tablecloths
and linen napkins.

CERAMIC DECORATION
The centre of Tunisian ceramics
was once Guellala, on the island
of Jerba. Its local craftsmen
arrived at Nabeul in the 15th
century, possibly attracted by the
quality of the local clay. The
Guellala potters often use Berber
motifs and favour brown and
beige colours. Nabeul craftsmen
prefer floral designs. Each item
is hand-decorated by an artist.

UNISIAN POTTERY GOES BACK
T
to the Neolithic
period when large jugs and vases were used
T
for storage. In the early years of the Muslim era,
during the Aghlabid dynasty (649–909), a new
technique was introduced known as “mirror”
dyeing that involved the use of metallic dyes. The
periods of the Fatimids and Zirids (10th and 11th
centuries) mark a revolution in the decorative arts
of this region when figurative images began to
appear on vases and mosaics. During those days,
Tunisian ceramics were in high demand and
were exported to Andalusia and Sicily.
Turkish influences are in
evidence from the 16th
century onwards.
The Ottoman 
Turks introduced
polychromatic (many
coloured) designs,
with flowers being
a frequently used
motif. These
techniques
produced brightly-
coloured designs
on bowls, jugs, tiles,
vases and all kinds
of other vessels.
POTTERY WORKSHOP
Workshops that produce ceramics are
generally small. They employ a
handful of people, often members of
one family. Separate rooms are used
for moulding, firing and decorating
the items. Visiting tourists are
generally invited to see the final
stages of the process when artists
decorate the bowls and jugs.

Exploring Hammamet
The most pleasant time of the
day in Hammamet is the late
afternoon, when the streets
and cafés fill with people
emerging after their afternoon
siesta, and the sun casts a
warm glow on the walls of
houses. The compact medina,
built by the Hafsids, is well
worth exploring and includes
ancient bathhouses and shops
hidden away in the narrow
alleys. The Great Mosque and
the kasbah are strategically
located by the medina’s 
main entrance. 
At sunset, head for the café
situated by the kasbah at the
entrance to the medina. This
delightful spot is a pleasant
place to savour a cup of mint
tea or coffee and watch the
world go by.
The main streets of the new
section of town are Avenue
Bourguiba and Avenue de la
République, where most
shops, banks, and some good
restaurants are situated. At
their junction stands the
Centre Commercial, which
was opened in 1979.
P Medina
Through the main gate –  Bab
el-Souk – is the entrance to
the medina. It is surrounded
by high walls, erected in 
AD 904, and was rebuilt in
the 13th century during the
period of the Hafsid dynasty.
Immediately past the gate
there are souvenir vendors
with colourful stalls and small
shops full of rugs, lovely
oriental mirrors and old (or
imitation) jewellery. In the
first street to the left
(counting from the gate) are
the Turkish baths (open to
men in the morning, and to
women in the afternoon). 
There is little need for a
detailed map when
wandering around
Hammamet’s medina, and it
is easy to get into the rhythm
of its narrow streets with its
unique patchwork of
alleyways. Walking around,
there is a pleasant variety of
details to take in – a
doorknocker in the shape of
the hand of Fatima, for
example, or a flower-pot set
against the white wall of a
house. Visitors can step into
Dar Hammamet in order to
see a traditional Tunisian
house with a collection of
costumes which have been
gathered together from all
over Tunisia.

GEORGE SEBASTIAN
In the early 20th century, Hammamet became the favourite
haunt of artists, aristocrats and politicians including
Winston Churchill, who worked on his
memoirs here. This is largely due to
George Sebastian, a Romanian millionaire
who liked it so much that he decided to
make it his home. He built a magnificent
villa (now the International Cultural
Centre) set in a beautiful park. George
Sebastian used it to entertain many writers
and artists, including Paul Klee and
André Gide. Word spread and he
was soon not the only foreign
resident. The town also lured the
American couple John and Violet
Henson and their house became
a meeting place for the artistic
elite from all over the world.

festive atmosphere it is best to
visit the town in September,
during the wine festival that
coincides with the all-
important harvest.
Grombalia is one of Tunisia’s
wine-producing regions. Vines
have been cultivated here
since Punic times. In order to
protect the plants from the
heat, the vineyards were laid
out facing north, the vines
were planted in trenches and
their roots were covered with
stones to provide protection
from rain and the summer
heat. The Phoenicians were
believed to have produced
excellent wines. The Romans
upheld these traditions, but
with the arrival of Muslim
civilization, wine production
declined. Grapes continued to
be cultivated, but on a
much smaller scale. This
is largely because the
drinking of alcohol was
not encouraged by the
Prophet. This rule was
strictly adhered to in the
early days of Islam, but
Imam ibn Hanifa and
the Hanefite school of
law allowed their
followers to drink
certain types of wine.
Wine-drinking was
widespread towards
the end of the
Ummayad dynasty.
In some branches
of Sufism, wine has
come to symbolize the
Absolute, with wine-induced
intoxication regarded as a state
of mystic ecstasy in which the
sufi draws closer to God.
Bir Bou Regba, a small town
close to Nabeul, comes alive on
market days. Visitors usually
head for the dried-out riverbed
of Faoura. The target of their
trips is the small waterfall (also
sometimes dry) situated a short
distance up the course of the
river. Water flowing from the
spring runs over the stones that
are believed to be the remains
of a Roman aqueduct. One of
the ravines in the valley used
to contain a sanctuary devoted
to the Punic god Baal
Hammon and the goddess
Tanit (see p110).

N TUNISIA, doors are regarded
as symbols reflecting the
fortune and happiness of the

therefore solidly built of palm
wood, reinforced with sheet
metal and often set within richly
decorated portals. They are
usually painted blue, though
they can be brown or yellow.
Only the doors leading to

Under the Hafsids (13th–16th
century) Tunisian doors were
almost entirely devoid of
decoration. In the 16th and
17th centuries, the Moorish
style introduced geometric
patterns, which under Turkish
rule were supplemented with
stylized plants and flowers. In
the 19th century, European

Ornament and
opulence are the
hallmarks of this
sturdy 18th-century

with nails that form
complicated designs.
Frequently used
motifs include stars,
plants, flowers and
crescents. The side
posts are decorated
with spiral columns
supporting a
typically Islamic
horseshoe arch.
An Italian influence is clear in
the semicircular wrought-iron
grille in the top section of this door.
The light blue colouring is inspired
by the European fashion  and
appeared in the 20th century.
European influence
led to hearts and stylized
flowers on rectangular 
tiles replacing doorway

studs and nails.
Doorknockers are present on
every door. They are often in the
shape of a large circle or a
hand. The ones on the left are
usually used by women, the
ones on the right by men.

NORTHERN TUNISIA
F
OR MANY YEARS northern Tunisia was little appreciated by visitors
who preferred other parts of the country such as the east coast
of Cap Bon and the resorts around Tunis. This situation is
gradually changing and the mild Mediterranean climate, rugged
coast, magnificent beaches and Roman sites such as Bulla Regia are
attracting visitors in increasing numbers.

The indigenous population of
the northern regions of Tunisia
were the Berbers, but it 
was the Phoenicians who
established 
the 
earliest
settlements here – including
present-day Utica, Bizerte
and Tabarka. They were
attracted by the fertile soil of
the region and its calm bays, in
which they could safely anchor
their ships. 
Following 
the 
downfall 
of
Carthage, Rome took over the former
Punic settlements, turning them into
fast-growing military colonies. Towns
such as Béja, Bulla Regia, Utica and
Bizerte owe their prosperity to grain
and trade. The fertile soil of the
Medjerda Valley was the granary of
Phoenicia and Rome, and it remains
agriculturally important today. The
region owes much to the Arab
immigrants who arrived from
Andalusia in the 17th and 18th
centuries. Besides cereals and
vegetables they began to grow
almonds, figs, citrus fruit and
grapes. The vineyards of Raf
Raf and Béja produce fine
Coteaux D’Utique wines. 
Bizerte and Tabarka –
northern Tunisia’s largest
towns – have long-established
maritime traditions dating back to
Phoenician times. Both were once
major ports, pirate strongholds and
naval bases. Today their economies
are based on industry and on a
steadily growing tourist trade, with
numerous resorts and hotels
springing up. Bizerte, nicknamed the
“Venice of the North”, has a lovely
old harbour and a charming medina,
while at Tabarka there is a coral reef
and a first-class golf course.

CORAL
Coral, brought up by
divers and fishermen from
the seabed, has been in
high demand throughout
North Africa for many
years. Since the 15th
century, when the
Europeans discovered its
beauty, coral jewellery has
fetched a high price.
Tabarka is a centre for
jewellery made from coral
and shops sell necklaces,
pins and brooches with
coral inserts. It has long
been used as a talisman:
red coral is believed to
bestow vitality, pink coral
is conducive to pleasant
thoughts, while white coral
clears the mind. Coral is
becoming scarce, however;
some visitors choose not to
buy it for this reason.
red-tiled roofs of the
Genoese fort can be seen
from almost any point in
town but the best view is
from the jetty. The beautifully
located hotel Les Mimosas
also affords a magnificent
panoramic view of the town,
the gulf and the surrounding
area. A little further west from
the harbour stands an ochre-
coloured rock formation –
Les Aiguilles (The Needles),
sharpened by the constant
erosion of wind and rain. 
A Cork Museum is a short
way out of town on the road
leading to Aïn Draham. It
provides information on cork
production in this area.
Tabarka has quiet beaches
and a number of golf courses.
It also has some of Tunisia’s
best diving. About 60 km (37
miles) north of Tabarka is the
Galite archipelago, which can
be reached by boat from
Tabarka. Details can be
obtained from any of Tabarka’s
diving clubs (see p307).

ABARKA IS JUST
T
22 km (14
miles) from the Algerian
border and is one of the
greenest towns in Tunisia. Its
picturesque setting includes
beaches to the north and
gentle hills overgrown with
cork oak, pine and mimosa to
the south. 
The town stands on the site
of a former Phoenician
colony, Thabraca. During
Roman times Tabarka was an
important port used for
shipping grain from Béja and
marble from Chemtou to
Rome. As well as its forests
full of game, Tabarka’s
greatest asset was its coral
reef. In the 16th century the
exclusive rights to coral
fishing were granted to the
Genoese who built an
offshore fort close by. With
the advent of the French
Protectorate, in 1881, coral
rights were taken up by the
French and Tabarka and Le
Kef were two of the first
towns to be occupied.
Tabarka is quite small. It
centres round two streets
running parallel to the coast,
where most of its restaurants
and cafés can be found. The

Rainbow wrasse
is a colourful fish
belonging to the
perch family. Only
active during the
day, it buries itself
in the sand at night.
Fish graze near
the bottom of the
sea, searching
for food in rock
crevices and
amongst the
coral where they
can hide. They
often assume the
colour of the
reef, which
makes them
invisible to
predators.
Red coral knolls grow on the rocky bottom of the
Mediterranean Sea. As well as being collected with
nets, coral is also cut using a special device
consisting of heavy, metal-reinforced beams. These
are set in the shape of a cross, weighted with a
stone in the centre and have loosely weighted nets
at the corners. The cross is pressed into crevasses
and the nets wind themselves around the coral,
breaking it off the bedrock.
The dusky grouper is a very large, slow-swimming fish.
It can sometimes be curious about divers and therefore
presents an easy target for spearfishing. Reefs provide it
with plenty of hiding places, although it does not have
many natural enemies other than mankind.
T
ABARKA’S CORAL REEF is close to the
shore. Just 10 minutes away by boat
is a rock surrounded by black and red
corals. A little further on is a
magnificent complex of tunnels,
grottoes, underwater caves and
caverns. Warm waters mean that the
reef teems with life. Flitting between
coral branches are colourful marine
fish and luminescent jellyfish.
Other marine occupants include
sponges, sea urchins, sea cucumbers
and sea squirts. Deeper waters are
inhabited by halibut, moray eel and
wrasse. Diving for coral is popular
along the entire northern shore of
Tunisia, but the most beautiful
specimens come from the waters
around Tabarka. Its popularity means
that coral is an endangered species.
Swallowtail sea perch is a small
predatory fish that lives in large shoals.
Its bright colouring makes it highly
conspicuous. It can be seen grazing
near entrances to underwater caves in
which it seeks shelter when threatened.
Wrasse
favour rocky coastal waters
and reefs. Here they find the small fish, as well as
snails, mussels, crabs and other invertebrates that 
make up their staple diet.

OT MUCH HAS survived in
Chemtou from the former
Roman colony of Simithas,
which was established in the
1st century BC. Chemtou owed
its existence to the quarries
which provided a dark-yellow
marble that was highly prized
by the Romans. Blocks of
marble were marked
with the name of the
emperor and were
transported on carts
to Tabarka across the
mountains.
The site included
workers’ homes,
baths, a theatre and 
a workshop. Aerial
photographs taken in
the late 1960s
revealed a large
labour camp. It was
built in AD 154 and
housed the slaves
who worked in the
quarries. The quarries
remained active until
Byzantine times, but
were abandoned
after the arrival of the
Arabs (7th century).

The ancient quarries at Chemtou
The site was first excavated
in 1968 and many of the finds
from this dig can be found in
the excellent site museum,
which was opened in 1990.
Among the displays are a
detailed explanation of the
excavation, a working model
of an ancient flour mill and
over 1,600 gold coins that
were discovered when the
museum was being built. 
One surprise of the
excavation work was the
discovery of a Numidian
temple to Baal Hammon at
the top of the hill. Dating
from the 2nd century BC, 
the find suggests that the
Numidians had a more
sophisticated culture than
historians had once believed.
The quarries are located
opposite the museum. The
huge holes dug into the rock
attest to the amount of sheer
effort and human endurance
that went into working them.
Further on up the hill are
the ruins of a temple.
Originally a Numidian site, it
was converted into a temple
dedicated to Saturn by the
Romans. Particularly
interesting among Chemtou’s
other relics are the rock
carvings found on the
western and northern sides 
of the hill.

trunks of freshly-stripped
trees can be seen everywhere.

the Khroumirie tribes who
were renowned for their
bravery. When French troops
invaded in 1881, it was the
Khroumirie who put up the
fiercest resistance. The forests
were once the favourite
hunting grounds of local
tribes, as well as visiting
Europeans. The last lion was
killed in 1891; all hunters have
been left with is wild boar. In

T
ESTOUR IS ONE of Tunisia’s
Andalusian Muslim towns.
In the 17th century, 80,000
Arabs who were expelled from
Andalusia after the Christian
reconquest arrived in Tunisia.
The wealthier refugees were
allowed to settle in Tunis but
the poorer farmers had to
make do with the uninhabited
regions of the country’s
interior. After petitioning the
authorities they were granted
the right to settle on the
Roman site of Tichilla, which
became present-day Testour. 
The farming techniques
brought from Andalusia
helped the newcomers turn
the barren land into fertile
oases and their attachment to
Andalusian traditions injected
a European flavour into the
Arab settlements. Testour’s
central square became the
focal point of the town
layout. Windows now faced
the streets and mosques
acquired their distinctive
arches. Testour’s main square
is one of the earliest products
of the 17th-century Spanish
influence. It contains several
cafés, the Great Mosque and
the hammam and is planted
with numerous orange trees
and jasmine shrubs. Leading
to the square is the town’s
main street – Avenue Habib
Bourguiba. 
Testour used to have 14
mosques. Five of them remain
open to this day. The main
one – the Great Mosque
(17th century) is open only to
Muslims and is a good
example of Tunisian Moorish
architecture. The square base
of the tiled minaret is
crowned with two octagonal
towers, one built into the
other, and is reminiscent of a
Castilian bell tower. The most
striking evidence of
Andulasian influence is the
clock on the minaret’s south
face. Besides the fact that a
clock is not seen on a minaret
anywhere else in the world,
the other surprising feature is
the hours, which go
backwards, revealing,
perhaps, the refugees’ desire
to turn back time and return
to their homeland.
Nearby, in El-Andalouse
Square, are the ruins of the
first Great Mosque (1610).
Rue du Mars, running parallel
to Avenue Bourguiba,
contains the Abdellatif
Mosque, also known as the
Hanefite mosque. 
For most of the year,
Testour is a quiet town but it
can get busy in June during
the Festival of Malouf music.

T
HE ROAD FROM
T
Tabarka to
Béja (which in ancient
T
times was called Vaga) runs
amid gently rolling hills
covered with eucalyptus,
stone-pine and oleander. The
town – the capital of the
province – is 250 m (820 ft)
above sea level, and lies in
the valley of the Medjerda
River. Béja is an important
grain town and a weekly
market has been held here
since Roman times. The town
was attacked and destroyed
by the Vandals in the 5th
century, only to be rebuilt by
Emperor Justinian who
named it Theodoriana, in
honour of his wife. The ruins
of the Byzantine kasbah that
dominate the old town date
from that period.
The most charming part of
modern-day Béja is its small
medina. It is a busy and
atmospheric place and the
many mosques, zaouias
(tombs), Islamic schools and
public baths are punctuated
by colourful market stalls.
Head for Rue Farhat Hached
for a fine view from the
medina over the town and
the surrounding countryside.
ENVIRONS: Some 13 km (8
miles) south of Béja stands
Trajan’s Bridge. Built in AD
29, it linked Carthage with
Bulla Regia (see pp132–3).
Heading north, towards Beni
Metir, 8 km (5 miles) beyond
Béja, is Henchir el-Fouar.
Excavations begun in 1960
unearthed the ruins of Roman
villas, a small forum and two
basilicas, which formed the
Roman town of Belalia Major. 
It is worth stopping for a
while in Tebourba – a little
town on the banks of the
Medjerda River, set in gardens
and olive groves. Tebourba
has a pleasant medina, laid
out on a regular grid pattern.
As well as a number of
market stalls, the town has a
17th-century Great Mosque
and a handful of smaller
mosques and zaouias. The
oldest of the zaouias is
dedicated to Sidi Thabet and
dates from the 7th century.

the beautiful Sidi Mechrig
beach and Cap Serrat.
Sejnane 8
Road map B1. * 2,000.
S
EJNANE – a small village
hidden among the hills
overgrown with laurel,
oleander and eucalyptus
– lies along the road
that links Bizerte with
Tabarka. Quite close to
Béja and Cap Serrat,
the village is
inhabited by
Berber tribes
who lead a semi-
nomadic life. The air
here is suffused with
the smell of pine
resin and the
bread baking in
outdoor ovens. 
Sejnane is famous
for two things: its
lovely beige pottery
and its numerous
storks’ nests. The
storks, of which there
were twenty-four
pairs at the last count, build
their nests each spring. 
The birds seem fairly
indiscriminate as to where
they site their nests and
can be seen on the roofs of
the local houses, the train
station, and (behind the
station) on some abandoned
mining apparatus.
The techniques used to
create the pottery made here
date back thousands of years.
The clay is shaped by hand,
then decorated. Some of the
decorations are drawn directly
onto the wet clay and the
grooves are filled with a black
resin from the mastic tree.
The items are baked on open
fires in the yards of the
houses. Pots of various
shapes and sizes and animal
figurines, which are painted
by hand by the Berber women
using traditional motifs, are
most common. The typical
colours of the Sejnane
products are beige, rust-red
and black. 
Originally, such pottery was
intended for domestic use or
as talismans created to bring
success and happiness.
Sejnane pottery includes
heavy plates, water jugs, deep
platters, animal statuettes and
censers. These are filled with
herbs and aromatic resins,

AP SERRAT IS situated away
from the busy tourist
centres. Its steep cliffs drop
down to the sea and the
views from the top are truly
breathtaking. The remote
beach on the eastern side of
this little peninsula is long,
sandy and, for much of the
time, virtually deserted. It is
visited mainly by local
Tunisians who come here in
family groups. A small café
next to the beach caters for
campers during the summer.  
The road between Cap
Serrat and Cap Negro is an
exceptionally scenic one. It is
fringed with laurel, mimosa
and pine trees. Cap Negro (its
name is associated with the
Genoese settlers) is an old
trading post, built in the 16th
century by the French who
traded in grain. It is now
occupied by the National
Guard. The area is beautiful,
but has virtually no roads and
is best explored on foot.
The region between Cap
Serrat and Tabarka is full of
pine, eucalyptus, mimosa,
oleander, cork oak and fruit
orchards. Sometimes
described in brochures as
“Green Tunisia”, it is a long
way from the typical Tunisian
image of desert and beaches. 
ENVIRONS: About 40 km (25
miles) off the coast from Cap
Serrat is the volcanic
archipelago of La Galite.
Consisting of seven volcanic
islands, this was already
known to the Phoenicians.
During Roman times it was
called Galathea. The waters
around the islands are rich in
marine life and are a superb
place to go diving. There is
no regular transport between
the islands and the mainland,
but it is possible to get here
by boat from Tabarka. Details
can be obtained from one of
Tabarka’s diving clubs (see
p307). Although remote, the
islands are inhabited by a
handful of families who make
their living from fishing and
cultivating grapes.

coast. They inhabit the steep
craggy shores in the north
of the country.
Lanner falcons live in the border areas, between the
mountains and the desert. This bird of prey builds
its nest in rock crevices and hunts in open
spaces. It catches birds and small rodents.
Unlike many other species of falcon it can
also catch its prey on the ground.
Common cranes can be

basin. The shallow, freshwater lake and its
surrounding marshes are a sanctuary to thousands of
waterfowl which nest here during the mild winter
(see p135). Other animals inhabiting the reserve
include toads, terrapins,
porcupines, jackals,
wild boar and foxes.
There is even a herd
of water buffalo,
which is descended
from Asian buffaloes
brought here in the
19th century.

ENZEL BOURGUIBA is a
small industrial town
situated 24 km (15 miles)
south of Bizerte. To get here
take a car or louage (shared
taxi) which can be hired in
front of Bizerte’s railway
station. The town was
established by the French in
1897. Originally called
Ferryville, it was built on the
ruins of a Spanish fortress,
and was intended for
European immigrants. The
French built an arsenal and
five dry docks here that were
once the biggest in Africa. In
the early 20th century the
small town that sprung up
around the arsenal was
nicknamed “Little Paris”.
Not much remains of the
original provincial town.
Since 1963 Menzel Bourguiba
has been developing as an
important centre of the textile
and metal industries. It has a
large harbour that links
directly with the Mediterranean
through the Bizerte Canal.
Menzel Bourguiba’s main
street has an impressive
modern mosque.
Seaside promenade beside the beach in Bizerte
(the road that runs parallel to
the coast) have prompted the
building of many modern
hotels. The picturesque old
town and the fishing harbour
run along the canal. The
newer, European, part of the
town begins at the point
where the canal joins up
with Lake Bizerte. 
The most attractive part of
Bizerte is its Old Port, built
on the canal that links the
lake with the sea. Here,
the quay is lined
with quaint cafés
where it is pleasant
to sit out and
watch the boats
heading out to sea.
The Old Port is
entered through a
huge gate, 35 m
(115 ft) wide. The
promenade that starts
by the kasbah runs in
a gentle arc along
the canal. The
kasbah and the
small 11th-century citadel,
standing on the opposite side,
once formed parts of the
fortifications that guarded the
medina and the harbour. Built
by the Arabs on the site of a
with the sea. A modern-day
commercial port, Bizerte has
long had a strategic
importance. It was the
Phoenicians who first settled
here and dug a channel
linking the lake to the sea,
thus producing one of the
safest harbours in the
Mediterranean. They named
their town Hippo Zarytus.
The Romans destroyed it in
146 BC only to rebuild it
again as Hippo
Diarrhytus. It was
subsequently
renamed Benzert
by the Arabs.
Under the French
Protectorate the
town became a
major naval base.
During World War
II it was occupied by
German troops and
suffered considerable
damage in the
course of Allied
bombardments. In
the past decade Bizerte has
developed its tourist
infrastructure. The

Byzantine fortress, the
traditional Byzantine brick
arrangement can be seen to
this day.
The kasbah dates from the
17th century. Behind its huge
walls, which are up to 10 m
(33 ft) high in places, is a self-
contained town within a town
which includes atmospheric
streets and alleys, a mosque,
baths and a number of
homes. The Fort Sidi el-Hanni
tower now houses the
Oceanography Museum,
which has a small collection
of sea creatures. 
Originally, there was only
one gate leading to the
medina, which is now hidden
behind the fa˜ades of the
houses that line the banks of
the canal. Until the 19th
century it was surrounded by
a 6-m (20-ft) high wall that
was 3.5 m (11 ft) thick. All
that remains of it now is the
segment between the
Andalusian district and the
so-called Spanish Fort. 
The Spanish Fort is
actually Turkish in origin and
was built in the 16th century.
Little of its original structure
remains, though a Muslim
cemetery lies within its
defensive walls. The fort’s
terrace offers a magnificent
view over the surrounding
area, including the Old Port
and the modern harbour. In
summer it serves as a venue
for concerts. 
The Great Mosque at the
centre of the medina was
built in the 17th century. Its
octagonal minaret is crowned
with a balcony that can be
seen from every point along
the promenade. The mosque
is surrounded by a number of
small zaouias (tombs), but
the most important of them,
the Zaouia of Sidi Mostari, is
situated some distance away.
This tomb was built on 
the orders of Murad Bey, in
1673. It features an ablutions
room, a dome-covered
sanctuary containing El-
Mostari’s tomb, and a
beautiful galleried courtyard.
It is worth visiting the
Andalusian quarter where the
Arab refugees from Spain
settled in the 17th century.
Once situated beyond the
town walls, it had its own

The kasbah defending the harbour entrance, Bizerte
mosque, with a square
minaret topped by a roof of
green tiles. The houses here
also have a distinctly Spanish
character with light blue
doors decorated with studs
and nails. However, with the
passage of time, the town
wall vanished and the
Andalusian quarter lost much
of its identity. 
Returning to the medina, to
the quayside promenade, it is
worth stopping in Café Le
Pasha. In the evening its
terrace provides a lovely view
of the canal and the colourful
lights of the nearby cafés.
Immediately behind the 
café, situated between the
souks, the Old Port and the
harbour, is Place Lahedine
Bouchoucha. Here, a 17th-
century mosque featuring an
octagonal minaret is decorated
with an external gallery. One
section of the square is
occupied by a market selling
fish, fruit and vegetables. 
A short distance further on
is the Tourist Information
Bureau. Immediately behind
it the canal walk ends, but
continue walking along its
opposite side and there is a
good view of the kasbah
walls. The main street that
runs along the quay leads to
the beach, and further on to
the tourist zone.

Reminders of the town’s
Punic heritage include a

necropolis. The baths and
two theatres date from
Roman times as do the
Treasury Building, the
House of the Hunt and the
House of the Cascades.
The latter has a
colonnaded inner
courtyard and was once
a villa belonging to a
wealthy Roman
citizen. Its other
features of note
include a fountain and

Not much is known about
the early days of Utica’s
history. Scarce information
began to appear in ancient
Greek texts but only after
the founding of Carthage.
Utica is regarded as the
second most important
ancient town after
Carthage in this
region. At its height, it
had its own harbour
and merchant fleet
and fought alongside
Carthage against
Greece and Rome.
However, in the
course of the Third
Punic War (149–146
BC) it switched
allegiance, declaring
itself on the side of
Rome. Following
the destruction of
Carthage it was
granted autonomy in AD 146
and became the capital of the
Province of Africa. It remained
as such until the rebuilding of
Carthage. The town’s economic
growth reached its zenith in
the 2nd and 3rd centuries
when it derived most of its
revenue from trade. Today
Utica no longer borders the
sea as the deposits carried by
the Medjerda River have
clogged up the bay.

THE SAHEL
L
ONG SANDY BEACHES, sparkling emerald waters, jasmine-scented
nights: these are the images usually associated with the Sahel.
The  eastern coast of Tunisia (Sahel is Arabic for coast) stretches
from Nabeul, through Sfax and the Gulf of Gab¯s, to Libya. It is here
that Tunisia’s most famous resorts and yacht harbours are found, as
well as the historic towns of Mahdia, Sfax and Sousse.
Hotel bungalows in one of the Sahel’s tourist zones
1 4 5
To the Phoenicians and Romans
the Sahel was one of the most
important regions with thriving
Roman towns and colonies
including 
Hadrumetum
(Sousse) and El-Jem, which
was one of the richest towns
in Roman Africa. Such
municipia were able to fund
ambitious construction projects
including the amphitheatre at El-
Jem, which is one of the most
impressive monuments of Roman
civilization in Africa. The citizens of
El-Jem had their own administration
and possessed civic rights on a par
with the citizens of Rome.
The wealth of the region was based
on the trade in olives. The oil was
valued by the Romans for its flavour
but was also used in lamps. With
some 15 million olive trees, the Sahel
accounts for over two-thirds of
Tunisia’s olive oil production.  
Great towns such as Mahdia,
the former capital of Tunisia,
and the Sahel’s ribats (fortified
Islamic monasteries) are a
reminder of the region’s past
when it was under constant
threat from piracy and
Christian invaders. Monastir’s
historic ribat is particularly
interesting as it is not only
the oldest and the best-
preserved in present-day Tunisia,
but is also one of the few along
the entire African coast that
admitted women as teachers and
students. Islamic holy men are still
held in great esteem in this part of
the country and the zaouias (tombs)
are more than mere relics of the past.
French influence can be seen in the
new towns (villes nouvelles) of
Sousse and Sfax although the ancient
medinas of these two ports still have
much of their maritime atmosphere.

GETTING THERE
The Sahel region has two airports – one in Monastir
and one in Sfax. Monastir’s airport handles the majority
of charter flights. The Métro du Sahel (which has a
stop-off at Monastir’s airport) provides a comfortable
transport link between Monastir, Mahdia and Sousse.
The entire coast up to Sfax has railway links with
Tunis; many trains run from Hammamet to Sousse
(change at Bir Bou Regba). The louage (shared taxi)
also provides a convenient means of transport; private
taxis are popular on the route between Sousse and
Monastir. A hired car is best for a trip inland.

JASMINE
The white jasmine plant was probably brought to Tunisia
from Arabia, Persia or India. The strong fragrance of its
delicate flowers is believed to lift the spirits and act as an
aphrodisiac. Tunisians can often be seen carrying small
posies of jasmine when out strolling or when sitting down
to dinner. Posies are some-
times given as welcoming or
parting gifts. Men place them
behind their ears or carry
them in their hands. Women
frequently wear garlands of
threaded flowers made into
fragrant white necklaces.

the ribat (fortified monastery).
Nearby is the Turkish-built
Zaouia Zakkak. One of the

Sousse’s ribat, dating from the
Aghlabid period, is one of 
the most famous and best-
preserved monastic fortresses
in Tunisia. Work on its
construction began probably
in AD 787 and was
completed in AD 821. It was
then that the Nador – the 
27-m (89-ft) high watchtower
– was added at the southwest
corner. The ribat was built at
a time when Christians
invading from Italy were a
constant threat and the tower
would have been used as a
lookout point as well as a
beacon for passing on
messages. Today it offers a
view over the entire town. 
The garrison consisted of
mercenaries paid by the state.

The Great Mosque stands at
the edge of the medina and
not – as is more common – at
its centre. Together with the
ribat and the medina walls it
formed part of the town’s
defensive system. This is
reflected in its architectural
design that resembles a
fortress rather than a mosque.
Built in 851, at the peak of
the Aghlabids’ golden age, it
was modelled on Kairouan’s
mosque. Its vast courtyard
(the only part open to
visitors) is surrounded by
columns; carved above them
are words from the Koran,
the date of completion and
the names of the mosque’s
builders. From one corner of
the building high stairs lead
to an octagonal sundial. The
minaret that rises above the
mosque was built two
centuries later. Before that
time, the faithful were called
to prayer from the tower of
the neighbouring ribat. The
prayer hall’s arched vault
rests on massive supports. Its
walls are built of stones laid
out in an intricate pattern
providing an austere
decoration for the interior.

and the third largest town in
Tunisia, Sousse was founded by the Phoenicians in
T
the 9th century BC and was, for a time, Hannibal’s naval
base. Throughout the Punic wars it was one of the
Phoenicians’ most important towns, along with Carthage
and Utica. Modern-day Sousse is a popular resort town
with a sandy beach, an historic walled medina and,
occupying part of the kasbah, an excellent museum with
mosaics from the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. 
Monument to the 1943 bombardment, on Place des Martyrs
Bourguiba there is a several-
storey-high Artisanat on the
right. It is a good idea to step
in here for a while before
entering the medina, to get
some idea of the prices. To
the southeast of the square is

13 m (43 ft) high. Vast
bastions were placed at the
corners and halfway along
each wall. The inner yard is
skirted by rows of portico-
shaded cells. On the ground
floor these surround the yard
on all four sides; on the first
floor – on three sides only;
the fourth side is taken up by
a large oratory that confirms
the religious character of the
building. During times of
peace, the ribat was used as a
place of study. Following the
building of the kasbah in the
southwest part of the medina,
the ribat lost some of its
military importance and
began to fall into ruin. It was
restored in 1722 and turned
into a Koranic school. Some
additional restoration work
was carried out in the 1950s.

Not far from the covered
souks and stalls on Rue
d’Angleterre is the Khalaout
el-Koubba. This building,
crowned with a distinctive
koubba (dome), dates from
the 11th or 12th century. Its
original purpose remains a
mystery. It was probably
some kind of tomb for a
major spiritual leader
or a meeting place.
The most
distinctive feature
of the Koubba is
its dome, which
is decorated
with a zigzag
frieze. This type
of decoration can
also be found on
some of the
domes in F¯s and
Marrakech
(Morocco), dating from the
Almoravid period. The central
court was added at some later
date, probably in the 17th or
the 18th century. 
The building was used as a
fondouk (inn) in the 14th
century and later became a
café. It was restored in 1980
and today houses the
Museum of Popular Arts
and Traditions, which is
devoted to the history of the
medina with life-size tableaux
illustrating marriage customs
and everyday activities.

+ Medina Walls
The medina’s western and
southern extremes are well
preserved and exceptionally
picturesque. It is worth taking
a stroll around here to get a
taste of the everyday life of
the medina’s inhabitants. 
In the 7th century Oqba ibn
Nafi’s army destroyed the
Roman town of Hadrumetum.
In its place, the Arabs built
Soussa and, some 200 years
later, during the Aghlabid
period Soussa (which was
renamed Sousse) became a
major port for the Aghlabid
capital – Kairouan. 
The 9th-century walls that
surround the medina date
from this time. They were
built to replace the earlier
Byzantine walls. To this day
they encircle the town with a
ring of stone that is broken
only near Place des Martyrs,
which was bombed during
World War II. At one time
there were eight gates. Only
four now remain standing –
Bab el-Gharbi, Bab el-Finga,
Bab el-Jerid and Bab el-
Khabli. The only section of
wall open to the public is
within the kasbah’s museum
(see below).

used oil mainly for industrial
purposes, it was – along with
wheat – Tunisia’s main
agricultural product. Now
over 50 varieties of olive trees
are grown here. 
Some 43 km (27 miles)

TUNISIAN DOLLS
This warrior-doll is a typical Tunisian souvenir.
The dolls are made by hand and come in a
variety of colours and sizes but always include
the same basic elements. The head is carved
from wood and sports bushy whiskers, while
its trunk is fashioned from wood and wire.
The warrior is dressed in wide trousers
with a colourful tunic over the top. In his
hand he holds a metal sword. The origin
of the doll is not clear, though its clothes
would suggest that it comes from Turkey.
Wooden puppets such as these are hung
on metal wires and can be seen in almost
all Tunisian markets.
Catacombs
About 2 km/1 mile from the town
centre, close to Rue Hamed el-

In 1888 a vast complex of
Christian catacombs was
discovered on the outskirts of
Sousse in the west part of the
town. This labyrinth of
chambers and corridors was
carved out of the soft rock
between the 3rd and 4th
century AD. Its wall niches
contain the remains of 15,000
Christians. The galleries
stretch over 5 km (3
miles), though only
a small fraction is
open to the public.
The Catacombs 
of the Good
Shepherd date
from the late 3rd
century. They are
1.6 km (1 mile) long
and include 6,000
graves; the Hermes
Catacombs date
from the 3rd
century and contain
2,200 graves. 
The section of
catacombs open to
the public consists
of a 100-m (328-ft)
long segment of the
Catacombs of the
Good Shepherd. Most of 
the graves are bricked up, 
but a few have glass
windows displaying the
human remains.

Monastir, along with Sousse
and Sfax, enjoyed a high
degree of autonomy. At this
time it resembled a small
republic and often gave
shelter to pirates. 
In the 20th century, Habib

Monastir into a smart modern
metropolis. He ordered the

ONASTIR WAS FOUNDED BY the Phoenicians as
a port and is a little way south of Sousse.
Julius Caesar camped here before the Battle
of Thapsus in AD 46 but the town’s main
claim to fame, aside from being a popular
resort, is as the birthplace of ex-president
Habib Bourguiba. Bourguiba lived here
until his death in 2000. He is now buried in
the cemetery on the town’s northern edge.
HABIB BOURGUIBA
Habib Bourguiba was
born in 1903. Having
studied law in Paris he
returned to Tunisia 
and embarked upon
intensive political work,
campaigning against the
French occupation of his
country. Initially a
member of the Destour
Party, he founded the
Neo-Destour Party in 1934.
When Tunisia regained
independence in 1956,
Bourguiba was proclaimed
its first president.

stands on a small rugged
headland in the Gulf of

shops are everywhere. The
signs of Habib Bourguiba’s
presence here are also

P Skifa el-Kahla 
Rue Obeid Allah

The huge gate
that leads to the
town was built in
the 10th century by Obeid
Allah. Its “dark passage”
(which gave the gate its
name) was once the only
entrance to the city and led
through a wall that was 10 m
(33 ft) thick in places. At the
time, Mahdia was the private
property of its ruler. All who
did not belong to the court
were forced to live outside
the walls and huge iron
grilles were lowered to deny
anyone else access to the city.
The original gate was
destroyed by the Spanish in
1554 but rebuilt the same
year. The former city entrance
today contains a covered
market selling perfume and
items of jewellery.
Exploring Mahdia
Mahdia has retained much of
its medieval charm. Its medina
is entered by a vast gate, Skifa
el-Kahla. Standing close to
Place du Caire is the Mustapha
Hamza Mosque and the Great

narrow boulevard are the
Municipal Museum, the ruins
of the former docks, the

The port’s construction is
generally attributed to caliph
Obeid Allah. It was most
probably built on the site of
the old Punic port. The
Fatimids had a very strong
fleet, which they inherited
from the Aghlabids. Obeid
Allah wanted Mahdia to be
both a fortress and a strong
naval base. The 15-m (49-ft)
long canal that leads to the
port was guarded by two
towers. Fragments of their

In Salakta, 14 km (9 miles)
from Mahdia and a short taxi
ride from Ksour Essaf, are the
ruins of the Roman port and
fishing village of Sullectum.
The port was probably used
for shipping lions that were
destined for the gladiatorial
arena at El-Jem. The nearby
beach is a pleasant place to
stroll and has some further
Roman remains including a
bath and some villa walls.

HE PORT OF SFAX is Tunisia’s second
largest city and its major commercial
centre. Once a Roman settlement, its
prosperity was founded on its shipping
fleet and the trade in olive oil. Sfax is
known for its unhurried atmosphere and
has a compact medina with wonderful
covered souks and two excellent
museums. A regular ferry route runs from the port to
the Kerkennah Islands (see p172).
U Great Mosque 
¢ to non-Muslims.
Begun in AD 849 by the
Aghlabids, the Great Mosque
was modelled on its famous
contemporary in Kairouan. It
stands at the heart of the
medina, at the junction of its
two main roads. The mosque
has been modified several
times and was rebuilt
extensively in 988 and 1035.
In the 12th century the
courtyard was reduced by
half, allowing for the
enlargement of the prayer
hall, which still maintains an
L-shaped layout. By the 18th
century the mosque was in its
present form.
The minaret, rising at the
north end of the courtyard, is
a replica of the minaret
adorning Kairouan’s Great
Mosque. It is three storeys
high and is richly decorated
with Kufic script and floral
motifs. The mosque is closed
to non-Muslims, its eastern
wall being the only section
that is visible. The best view
of the minaret can be had
from Rue des Aghlabites,
which runs along the north
side of the mosque.

wide avenues, squares and

Avenue runs from Hedi

Bab Diwan is the medina’s
main entrance and is located
on the south side. It was built
in the early 14th century, but
was extensively remodelled
in the 17th and 18th
centuries. It was finally
restored in the 20th century. 
Along with Bab Jebli in the
north, Bab Diwan was once
one of only two entrances to
the city. Its ironclad doors
would have been closed
tightly at night to protect Sfax
from intruders.
Bab Diwan was designed to
complement the 9th-century
walls built by the Aghlabids.
These walls originally marked
the boundaries of the city,
although modern Sfax has
long since outgrown these
limits. Beyond the walls were
olive groves, which flourished
thanks to earlier Roman
irrigation systems. One of the
gate’s towers now houses a
charming Moorish-style café.

the medina’s southern
quarter. Part of the building is
12th century but it was
gradually extended until, by
the 17th century, it had
reached the size of a large
fortress. Initially it served as a
watchtower and later as the
residence of the Hafsid
governor. After that, it
became the headquarters of
Sfax’s military commander. 
Today, the kasbah houses
the Museum of Traditional
Architecture and contains
exhibits on religious, private
and public Tunisian building.
A number of the exhibits are
outdoors. These include a
model illustrating the design
of the medina walls and the
construction methods used by
their builders. Best of all, a
trip to the kasbah provides 
an opportunity to walk along
the battlements.
Avenue Hedi Chaker
Hedi Chaker is one of Sfax’s
smartest streets. It runs from
the square in front of the
town hall to Bab Diwan – 
the main gate leading to the
medina. Along it there are
travel agents, pharmacies,
restaurants, music shops,
banks and a theatre.
P The Souks
Strolling through the shady
streets and alleyways it is not
hard to see that Sfax’s medina
is one of the loveliest and
best preserved in the whole
of Tunisia. Indeed, much of
Sfax’s market district was
used as a stand-in for Cairo in
the film The English Patient.t
The narrow alleys can be
crowded but become quieter
during siesta hours. The old
town is divided into markets
(souks) – specializing in
perfumes, spices, textiles,
bags, gold, carpets and food. 
Souk ar-Rabi, situated in the
northern part of the medina,
specializes in the production
of chechia hats, while the
former Rue el-Bey is now the

OR ISLAMIC COUNTRIES calligraphy, or
the art of handwriting, has a special
importance and copying the Koran is
a highly esteemed skill. The Islamic
edict prohibiting representation of the
human form further promoted
calligraphy as a kind of decoration.
Arabic calligraphy is based on the
Kufic script. This almost geometric
style was ideal for carving in stone.
Some fine examples of Kufic script
can be seen on the eastern wall of
Sfax’s Great Mosque. By the end of
the 12th century, Kufic had been
largely replaced in North Africa by a
style of calligraphy known as
Maghribi, which arrived in Tunisia via
Granada (Spain) and F¯s (Morocco).
Arabic Calligraphy
Paper was first
used by the Arabs
in the 8th
century. Blue
paper is very rare
and surviving
examples of early
Arab script 
on blue paper 
are highly valued
by collectors. 
Kufic script was used as a highly decorative element in
Islamic architecture. Its earliest forms were characterized by
rigid, angular lines.
The most valuable copies of
the Koran are embellished with
gold letters. From the 13th century
onwards, literary and scientific
works were also decorated.
El-bijazi, though
not ornamental, is
a popular form of
the Arabic script.
This private letter
was written on
parchment using
sepia ink.
Tomb steles were
often decorated with
Kufic script. Its
appearance evolved
with time, tending
towards richer
forms. This resulted
in a variety of types,
including floral
kufi, interwoven
kufi, and kufi
enclosed within
floral or geometric
borders. From the
12th century
onwards the Kufic
script was used only
for decoration.
Decorative calligraphic
compositions painted on glass
became popular in the 19th
century. Their roots can be
found in Ottoman art. Highly
colourful, they were often used to
display Koranic verses.

km (25 miles) south of Gab¯s.
This is the biggest and best
known of the troglodyte
villages, where the houses
have been dug out of the rock
to escape the intense daytime
heat. This building tradition,
which allows the rooms to
maintain an even temperature
of about 17° C (63° F)
throughout the year, goes
back hundreds of years. In the
1960s the three biggest cave
compounds were turned into
hotels. Many houses are still
occupied and they inspired
George Lucas, the creator of
the Star Wars films, to spend
many days shooting here. 
The current centre of the
region is New Matmata,
which is situated about 15 km
(9 miles) from old Matmata.
SPONGES
Tunisia is a good place to purchase real sponges, which
have been collected for hundreds of years from the Gulf of
Gab¯s. Sponges are marine creatures and spend their lives
motionless, attached to rocks
or the sea bed; they do not
have any nerve cells or
muscles, and do not display
any reaction to external
stimuli. They filter organisms
and organic matter by letting
a constant stream of water
flow through their bodies.
Sponges have amazing
powers of regeneration. Even
a tiny fragment, consisting of
just a few cells of the same
kind, is able to reproduce a
new sponge.

Its foremost historic relic is

The main attractions include

conditions for snorkelling.
The islands are flat (the
highest point is only 13 m/43

therefore ideally suited for
cycling. The main resort is

T WOULD BE HARD to imagine a
Tunisian town without a
bathhouse. The custom of
building them was passed
down from antiquity and the
need for them was kept up
by the Islamic requirement for
ritual cleanliness, particularly
the ablutions carried out prior
to prayers. At one time there
was at least one bathhouse in
every street, and in large
towns they could number
several hundreds. Visitors
would undress in a special
room, put on a thin towel
and enter the water. Washing
was originally carried out using
dried leaves of jojoba or
soapwort in place of soap.
Hammams were a
vital part of life in
Roman times and
served a social
function as well as
an hygienic one.
Everything needed
for a bath could be
bought from a
vendor who stood
by the front door.
The attendants
cleaned the rooms
and scrubbed the
slabs, which were
heated with hot air.
The Hammam
Women at the Baths by
Dominique Ingres
Temperatures in a Tunisian hammam are not as high
as in a  sauna. Nevertheless, the steam and the hot-
water pool will warm the body in no time at all.
Hammam rooms serve a variety of
purposes. Some are used for bathing;
others – filled with steam – for opening
the pores and cleansing the skin.
Massages and haircuts are
among the treatments offered in
hammams. Hammams once
employed barbers who were also
skilled in bloodletting. Payment for
a visit is made on leaving.
Women used to visit hammams around midday. This provided them with an
opportunity to go out (shopping was done by men). Older women would scrutinize
the younger ones, searching for wives for their sons.

Were it not for the dogged
determination of its people,
Jerba would remain no more
than a scrap of desert. The
inhabitants of the island have
managed to turn the barren
island into one big garden,
however, with olive and
orange groves and orchards.
There are about 4,000 wells on
the island, and the tourist zone is
supplied with water by an aqueduct.
Beautiful whitewashed mosques and
traditional menzels hidden behind
high hedges add to Jerba’s charm.
According to myth, Odysseus
landed here and nearly lost his crew
to the amnesia-inducing food of the
resident lotus-eaters. From the 4th
century BC, Jerba was ruled from
Carthage; later on it passed into the
hands of the Romans. The island’s
prosperity is derived from trading in
fish, olive oil and ceramics.
The advent of Islam in the 7th
century was accompanied by
the arrival of the Ibadites, an
austere Islamic school of
religious thought and practice
that was hostile to authority.
Their descendants still
inhabit western parts of the
island. In the 16th century
the Malekite School began to
gain popularity and now the
majority of Jerba’s population is
Sunni Muslim. There is also a small
but significant Jewish contingent,
whose ancestors arrived here some
2,000 years ago. Hara Sghira’s
synagogue is still a place of reverence
for Jews.
Medenine was once an important
stopping point for caravans and is a
good base for forays into the villages
scattered among the nearby hills.
JERBA AND THE MEDENINE AREA
T
HE ISLAND OF JERBA lies at the southern end of the Gulf of Gab¯s,
5 km (3 miles) from the mainland. It is known for its
wonderful sandy beaches, its warm climate and its
picturesque capital of Houmt Souk. Other attractions include fortified
smallholdings (menzels) and Ibadite mosques. Back on the mainland,
the area around Medenine has scenic hills and ancient villages.

ERBA’S CHARMING CAPITAL LIES ON THE island’s northern
shore. Houmt Souk literally means “market quarter”,
revealing the long-standing importance of trade to the
J
town, and its narrow streets and ancient souks are full
of shops selling jewellery, clothes and souvenirs. Also
of interest are the fondouks that were built as inns for
travelling merchants during the Ottoman period, and
the 13th-century fortress, Borj el-Kebir, which provides
stunning views along the coast.

Its foundations date back to

fortress on the island was built
by the king of Sicily, Roger de
Lluria, in 1289. It was
reinforced in the 14th century.
In its design, the fortress
combined defensive elements
with religious features and was
the most important part of the
island’s defence system. In the
16th century the famous pirate
Dragut reinforced its walls and
extended the entire structure.

The prayer hall’s 12 windows
allude to the Zohar – the
principal book of the Kabbala
– and symbolize the 12 tribes
of Israel. The interior is
decorated with rich fabrics,
wood-carvings and ceramic
tiles. It houses many items
donated by pilgrims from all
over the world. In order to
maintain the high status of the
synagogue, the Rabbi of Jerba
decreed it to be the only place
on the island where religious
scrolls are to be kept.
Particularly striking elements
of the interior furnishings
include a beautiful Torah
cabinet and Hanukkah lamps
made of wood and silver.
El-Ghriba (“the miracle”) is

concentrated mainly in two
villages – Hara Sghira (Er
Riadh) and Hara Kebira (Es

two villages (which are 
about 5 km/3 miles apart) 
are identical to any other

of the synagogues’
walls bear stern
notices: “If you talk

where do you pray?”
The island’s Jewish
community is mainly middle-
class and continues to
celebrate the Sabbath and
other Jewish festivals and
observe the main rituals. For 
a son’s circumcision, for
instance, a red blanket is hung
on the door as a sign of
invitation to everyone to come

which is a short way south of
Hara Sghira. This is the oldest
site of a synagogue in the
world and dates back to 586
BC; the present structure was
built in the 20th century. It is
an important place of
pilgrimage for Jews from all
over North Africa, especially
during the Passover Festival.
Although relations between
Muslims and Jews are
generally good on the island,
El-Ghriba was subject to a
terrorist attack in 2002 which
killed 21 people and
damaged part of the interior.

FORTIFIED MOSQUES
Besides being important
spiritual centres, Jerba’s
mosques were also
military defence
establishments. Their thick
walls provided shelter
from attacks, while their
minarets were used as
watchtowers. As well as
fortress-style minarets, the
local population also built
underground mosques. It
is likely that these were
used by the Ibadites for
secret prayer meetings.
One such mosque –
Jama’a el-Baldawi – can 
be found near the village
of Ajim. Its fa˜ade was
built in modern times.
Underground mosques are
distinguished by their
austerity and functionality.
Ibadite doctrine does not
permit any ornamentation
within the mosque, as this
could distract the faithful
from prayer.

MENZELS
Menzels are self-sufficient agricultural smallholdings. Although
many have been abandoned, some remain in use. The internal
area consists of a yard surrounded by white walls and
buildings. The buildings provide accommodation for people
and domestic animals; the yard also contains a granary and a
water cistern. The entire area is surrounded by a garden and a
palm grove. Menzels used to be interconnected with a maze of
roads to other menzels and the mosque. In this way, news of
approaching danger could be passed around instantly.

Ras Remel 4
Road map D5.
T
HE RAS REMEL peninsula in
the north of Jerba is just
under 10 km (6 miles) from
Houmt Souk, and is an ideal
spot for daytrips and picnics.
Its main attractions are the
wintering flocks of pink
flamingoes that migrate here
from southern France and
Spain, joining the fledglings
who spend the entire year
here. The waters surrounding
Ras Remel are shallow and
the muddy bottom provides
the birds with plenty of food.
A short distance from the
headland lies Flamingo
Island. Most hotels situated in
Houmt Souk’s tourist zone
organize trips to the island,
which are often combined
with lunch and swimming.
ENVIRONS: At the furthest
northwestern tip of the island
is Borj Jillij, a mere 3 km (2
miles) from Mellita Airport. A
lighthouse was first built here
in the 16th century. This was
replaced in the 18th century
by a fort, which is once again
being used as a lighthouse.
From here it is possible to
walk to Ajim along a narrow
and quiet country road.
Ajim – ancient Tipasa – is
situated 22 km (14 miles)
southwest of Houmt Souk.
Occupying the point closest
to the mainland it has regular
ferry links with Jorf (the ferry
can be busy, especially at
weekends). The village is
also a centre for sponge
diving (see p172). The MC116
road runs among palm and
olive groves. Fans of the first
Star Wars film may want to
search out the mosque that is
3 km (2 miles) up the coast
towards Borj Jillij – this was
used as the exterior of
Obiwan Kenobi’s house.
The small village of
Mahboubine lies in
the eastern part of
the island, 
3 km (2 miles)
southwest of Midoun, and
is surrounded by green
fields and gardens. Its
El-Katib Mosque is a
copy of the Hagia Sophia
in Istanbul. It was built in
the 19th century by Ali
el-Katib.
The village of Arku
lies at the centre of the
island, not far from the
coastal town of Aghir, which
marks the end of the tourist
zone. The village’s population
consist mainly of the
descendants of former slaves,
who were brought to Jerba
from Central Africa. Following
the abolition of slavery in
1846, the majority of the
island’s black inhabitants
chose to stay. Some adopted
the surnames of families for
whom they worked. Today
their main occupation is
agriculture, as well as basket-
and mat-weaving. They are
also renowned as outstanding
musicians and dancers.
Unlike the centre of Jerba,
which resembles one big
garden, with palm, fig and
olive groves, as well as
orange and apple orchards,
Jerba’s west coast is largely
uninhabited. A dirt road runs
from Ajim to Borj Jillij with
traditional Jerban
houses and small
fields scattered here
and there. The
coastline is rocky
and not good for
swimming, which
means that there are few
tourists. The dirt roads and
lack of facilities, however,
make it popular with
campers and cyclists who
don’t mind putting up with
a little hardship in
order to get away
from the bustle of 
the resort areas.

also convenient for a visit to
the small village of Arku (see
p181) or for a walk along the

several thousand years ago.
The village lies on the south
coast of Jerba and is the only
place on the island where the
Berber language is spoken.
Since ancient times this was
the island’s main
pottery centre. Jerba
was for centuries the
sole manufacturer of
ceramics in Tunisia,
and its products were
famous throughout
the Saharan region.
Even as late as the
19th century the
island paid the beys

in kind, in the form
of jars and pots 
that were used for
storing food.

this is Jerba’s second town,
after Houmt Souk. Midoun’s
population includes many
descendants of African slaves,
who were brought here from
sub-Saharan Africa. The
weekly Friday market attracts
crowds of people from all
over the island, as well as
from the nearby mainland
villages. The market is held at
the centre of the town’s small
medina. It sells a variety of
souvenirs, including local
ceramics, wood carvings,
leather goods and olive oil.
The other local event –
“Fantasia” – is staged every
Tuesday during the summer
and includes a mock wedding
ceremony accompanied by
music and folk dancing, as
well as displays of horse and
camel riding. At the centre of
Midoun, close to the junction
that leads to Houmt Souk and
the tourist zone, is an
underground massera (oil
press), covered with a white
dome at ground level.
Reconstructed dye-works in Guellala’s waxworks museum
The range of Jerba’s
traditional ceramics includes
amphora-like jars, which are
still used today. Most of the
production now centres on
enamelled goods that are
intended for visitors,
however. There are about 
450 small pottery shops
working in this area.
Traditional Jerba ceramics
are made of clay that is
excavated from mines up to
80 m (262 ft) deep. It is dried
for two to three days and
then mixed with water. The
products are left out to dry
for a further 60 days, and
only after that are they fired
for four days in kilns, which
are half-buried in soil. 
Guellala’s museum is a
little way north of the village
on the road to Cedouikech.
The colourful displays, using
waxwork tableaux, attempt to
conjure up scenes of
traditional Tunisian life such
as a shepherd with his flock
or a weaver at work.

HERE ARE LESS THAN 1,000 Jews
living in Jerba. According to
legend, a group of Jewish clerics
arrived on the island following the
fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC. They
brought with them a door from
the destroyed Jewish temple and
included it in the new El-Ghriba
synagogue. From Jerba, Jewish
colonies sprang up across
Tunisia and by the 2nd century
AD Tunisia was the home of the
majority of North African Jews.
Many Jews worked as jewellers
and established Jerba’s reputation
as a commercial centre. During
the 19th century Jews here were
forced to wear distinctive black
clothes to mark them out and 
anti-Jewish discrimination only
lessened with the arrival of the
French in 1881. Many Jews left
Jerba for a new life in Israel and
France in the 1950s and 60s.

It is closed only on the Sabbath,
when it is used by the Jewish
islanders for services.

Saturday, when Jerban synagogues fill with the 
faithful. The service is short, since the main 
celebrations traditionally take place at home.

ARZIS IS a large town and is
located 20 km (12 miles)
southeast of Jerba. In
geographical terms this area
belongs to the Jaffara Plains
that stretch between Gab¯s
and the Libyan border. Since
the 7th century this region
has been inhabited by Arab
nomads and a population that
led a semi-nomadic lifestyle.
Zarzis is surrounded by vast
olive and palm groves, with
about 700,000 olive trees and
110,000 date palms. The town
itself was built in the 19th
century by the French, who
established their garrison
here. The tourist zone has
fine sandy beaches and starts
4 km (2 miles) outside town.
The zone stretches for about
8 km (5 miles) along the
coast. It is becoming
increasingly important as one
of Tunisia’s tourist regions.
Medenine 9
Road map E6. * 18,000. @.
T
HIS IS an excellent base
from which to explore the
outlying villages. The town,
which is split into two by a
river bed (the Arab word
“medenijin” means “two
towns”), was once an
important stopping point for
caravans. During the French
Protectorate it housed a
military garrison. As the main
market town, to which goods
were brought from the entire
southern region, it became
southern region, it became
the administrative centre of
southern Tunisia. 
Initially Medenine consisted
of a large ksar, which in total
r
had over 6,000 ghorfas
(rooms). The nomads used
them for storing valuables,
mainly corn, seed and
vegetables, but they also left
in them articles that were not
needed on the journey.  
Each family had its own
ghorfa. During the 1960s 
most of the ghorfas were
demolished. Today the
handful of remaining ghorfas
have been turned into tourist
souvenir shops. 
Such ksour (plural of ksar)r
are symbols of an old way of
life, although they are
increasingly being abandoned
and falling into ruin, as the
villagers store their grain in
villagers store their grain in
modern silos on the
outskirts of the towns.
Nevertheless, there are
still many well-
preserved ksour in the
neighbouring area.
The best way to get to
them is by car (see
pp196–7).
ENVIRONS: A large
ghorfa complex can
be seen in Metameur,
6 km (4 miles) west of
Medenine. The village
inhabitants are semi-
nomadic. Some of
them are descended
from Sidi Ahmed ben
Adjel, a holy man who
founded the village in
the 13th century. The
best time to visit
Metameur is on
Friday, when the
nomads leave their pastures
and gather here for their
Friday prayers. The most
important building in town is
the 600-year-old ksar, which
r
has three storeys of ghorfas
built around three courtyards. 
From Metameur a road
(MC104) leads to Toujane, a
small half-deserted village
below the ruins of a kasbah.
Its flat roofs, made of olive
wood, resemble terraces. 
Some 80 km (50 miles)
southeast of Medenine is the
small town of Ben
Guerdane, which has 3,000
inhabitants. Every Friday
there is a market here. As

Palm trees of a Saharan oasis
Southern Tunisia lures visitors
with the sheer diversity of its
landscape. It holds special
appeal to holidaymakers who
simply wish to relax on the
beaches of the Sahel but is
also increasingly popular
with adventure-seekers. Only
a small section of the Sahara –
the world’s largest desert,
shared by 11 African countries –
belongs to Tunisia. Nevertheless, in
view of its relative safety, transport
facilities and tourist infrastructure, it
is this section of the Sahara that is
most easily accessible.
Here, visitors can journey along the
routes of former trade-caravans or
choose to follow in the footsteps of
Star Wars director George Lucas.
Nights can be spent in Bedouin
tents, remote mountain oases or
luxury hotels that resemble oriental
palaces. Pomegranates and
dates can be picked ripe from
the tree. Some visitors choose
to spend several days touring
the desert on camelback.
Others prefer to relax in
ancient 
Berber 
villages 
or lose themselves in
meditation amid the ancient
mosques of Sufi Nefta.
The Tunisian section of the
Sahara comprises three main
types of desert: the rocky
hamada; the pebbly serir and the
sandy erg. The latter is the most
picturesque and occupies the eastern
end of the Great Eastern Erg. Its
most impressive dunes can be seen
around Ksar Ghilane. 
During the summer, this region can
become unbearably hot. For this
reason, spring and autumn are the
best times to visit.

southern Tunisia a truly unique experience.

ITH SO MUCH CHOICE, it could be di
to decide what to see in southern
Tunisia. Visitors keen on ancient ruins 
find little of interest here, but those wh
seek spectacular, breathtaking scenery
cannot fail to be enchanted with the reg
which includes ancient mountain oases; 
shifting colours of Chott el-Jerid, and the
green oases of Nefta – the cradle of
Tunisian Sufism. Ksar Ouled Soltane,
perched on top of a mountain, has
some extremely well-preserved ghorfas. M
impressive of all, perhaps, is the Sahara
Desert which can be admired while perch
on a camel’s back or from a hot-air balloo

ARIOUSLY KNOWN
V
as the
“gateway to the Sahara”
and the “mouth of the
springs” (from the Berber
“foum tataouine”), this is
Tunisia’s southernmost tourist
base. It is situated 50 km (31
miles) from the Mediterranean
coast, along the popular
tourist trail that links Jerba
with Matmata and Douz with
the Saharan oasis of Ksar
Ghilane. Some fans of Star
Wars may also realize that
Tataouine provided the name
for Luke Skywalker’s mythical
and wind-blown home planet
of Tatooine.
A maze of alleys in Ksar Haddada
Some 150 million years ago
this area was inhabited by
dinosaurs before being
flooded by the sea. Mankind
has been forced to adapt to
the barren land and arid
climate. To this day the
Berbers show great respect
for the natural environment.
Berber women occupy
themselves with handicrafts,
weaving rugs and carpets and
sewing warm camel-wool
cloaks. The men produce
shoes called balgha which
have flattened toe-ends.
Tataouine was founded in
1892 by the French and is
today a major administration
centre of this region. It is
known for its hotels which
are distinguished by their
interesting architectural style
and locations, and for its
colourful markets selling fruit,
olives and Berber fabrics.
There is also a weekly
livestock market during the
early part of summer which is
popular with tribespeople
from the outlying villages.
Apart fromt the hotels and
markets Tataouine has little
tourist appeal though it does
provide a very convenient
base for exploring the local
ksour, such as Ksar Haddada
r
(29 km/18 miles), Ksar Ouled
Soltane (20 km/12 miles), and
Remada (78 km/48 miles).
The nearest one is Ksar
Megabla – only 2 km (1 mile)
from the centre of Tataouine
(in the direction of Remada).
Though this former fortified
village has been largely
destroyed, it does offer a
lovely view of the
surrounding area. 
The local delicacy is the
sweet honey-and-almond
bread (kab el-ghazal) baked
in the shape of a gazelle
horn. The annual Saharan
Ksour Festival (a five-day
event at the end of
March/beginning of April)
provides an opportunity to
witness camel races and
Berber wedding ceremonies
and to sample some of the
delicious local cuisine. 
Tataouine is also only 18
km (11 miles) from Chenini,
a Berber village occupying a
scenic position on a high hill,
which is famous for its 
ancient cave dwellings.

T
HE MAIN POINT of interest 
of this small village is its
superbly restored ksar, which
r
is one of the most striking
complexes of former fortress-
granaries to be found in
southern Tunisia. It stands at
the very centre of the village,
in close proximity to the
mosque, which is across
the road.
A large notice in front of
the main gate informs visitors
that in 1997 George Lucas
used this place as a location
for the Star Wars prequel,
The Phantom Menace.
It is worth diving deeper
into the maze of stairways,
terraces and small courtyards
and peeping into some of the
granary niches known as
ghorfas. These were once
used to store food by the
local Haddada and Hamdoun
tribes, and by two other
tribes which probably arrived
here from Libyan and
Moroccan territories. 
Today, a section of the ksar
has been converted into a
small hotel, which combines
the unique atmosphere of an
ancient ksar with a tinge of
Hollywood. The hotel’s
kitchen offers a simple menu;
the rooms, although
equipped with bathrooms,
are fairly austere. Right by the
entrance to the ksar is a
pleasant little café where a
glass of mint tea can be
enjoyed with a puff on a
hookah if desired.

STAR WARS
George Lucas – the creator of Star Wars films – was fascinated by the landscape of
southern Tunisia and used many of its most exotic sights and interiors as locations
for his epic space adventures. Luke Skywalker’s home at the beginning of the first
Star Wars movie was actually the interior of the Sidi Driss Hotel in Matmata for
instance, while the natural features of Ksar Haddada were used to conjure up slave
quarters in The Phantom Menace. The worldwide success of Star Wars helped to
promote many of Tunisia’s tourist
attractions and a percentage of the
revenue obtained from the sale
of tickets when the first film was
released in 1977 went to the
National Solidarity Fund that
helps the poorest regions of the
country in their fight against the
desert. Newly-established tourist
agencies have since begun to
offer trips that follow in the
footsteps of George Lucas – there
are even some local road signs
that point to Star Wars sites.

K
SAR OULED SOLTANE is the
most interesting and best-
preserved fortified village in
Tunisia, and is situated 20 km
(12 miles) south of Tataouine.
It is still used to store grain
and olives and is inhabited
by the Ouled Chehida
tribesmen (in between their
regular migration to
pasturelands to tend their
sheep, goats and camels).
Surrounded by an additional
set of defensive walls, the
complex consists of over 300
granaries – ghorfas. Rising up
to four storeys they are set
round two courtyards that are
linked by a narrow corridor
made of palm wood. The
older courtyard dates from
the 15th century; the newer
one was built in 1881. The
place is worth visiting
particularly on Friday, after
the main Muslim prayer
session, to witness the lively
discussions between the
Ouled Chehida tribesmen. 
The larger of the two ksar
courtyards is also sometimes
used as a venue for folk
shows, especially during the
Ksour Festival. The traditional
Berber music and dancing of
the ancient community are in
perfect harmony with the
architecture of this beautifully
restored fortified village.
Remada 4
Road map D6.
T
HIS SMALL OASIS lies 50 km
(31 miles) from the Libyan
border. A smallish Roman fort
once stood here. Under the
French Protectorate, the town
once again became a military
base. Due to its close
proximity to Libya, Remada
has remained a garrison town.
The only eye-catching feature
in the central Place de
l’Indépendance is a former
abattoir building, covered
with 15 small domes. This is 
a border zone, and any trip to
the desert requires special
permission from the military
authorities.
Borj Bourguiba, 41 km (25
miles) southwest of Remada,
is where the first president 
of Tunisia, Habib Bourguiba,

TUNISIAN CONDIMENTS
Harissa – a traditional Berber paste made with hot red
pepper, garlic, tomato puree and olive oil – appears on
every Tunisian table and is eaten with almost everything. It
it thought to strengthen the appetite and invigorate and
disinfect the body – including the respiratory tract. Harissa
is sometimes
served with small
pieces of tuna and
olives. Other herbs
and spices used in
Tunisian cuisine
include fresh and
dried mint leaves,
coriander, aniseed,
saffron, cinnamon 
and caraway.

S
URROUNDED BY THE dunes of
the Great Eastern Erg, this
small Saharan oasis is 147 km
(91 miles) southeast of Douz
and 100 km (62 miles) west
of Chenini. The Romans built
a frontier fort on this desolate
spot and the ruins of a citadel
can still be seen close by.
The only way to get to Ksar
Ghilane is by four-wheel-
drive car or by camel. It is
well worth stopping here for
a few days to see the shifting
reds, golds and yellows of the
desert sand.
Accommodation is not a
problem. Tourist camps with
Bedouin tents are furnished
with camp-beds and blankets.
Some campsites have
canteens offering a limited
menu; some even have
showers (though these are
not always working). For
more fastidious visitors there
is a luxury campsite with air-
conditioned Bedouin-style
tents, complete with
refrigerators and satellite TV.
Some meals are served with
genuine Bedouin bread – a
large flat cake that is tossed
into fire embers. After ten
minutes it is turned over and
left for a while longer. Bread
baked this way is delicious.
One special attraction of
Ksar Ghilane is bathing in the
palm-fringed pool that is fed
by the waters of a natural hot
sulphur spring. In the winter,
when the night temperature
drops to just a few degrees
above freezing (from over

“the gateway to
the Sahara”, this small
N
town lies on the edge of the
Great Eastern Erg that stretches
westwards, all the way to
Morocco. The oasis, which is
literally on the verge of the
vast desert dunes, is a major
springboard for exploring the
Sahara. This is where the
asphalt road ends and any
further journey southwards can
be made only by a four-wheel-
drive vehicle (approximately
seven hours to Ksar Ghilane)
or on camelback (five days to
Ksar Ghilane). 
A good time to visit is
during the International
Festival of the Sahara,
normally in November or
December. The festival,
which has been taking place
for over 30 years, is an
opportunity to witness the
ceremonies that have marked
the pace of life of the local
nomadic tribes. These include
wedding ceremonies, sheep-
shearing, duels, hunting and
camel races. From Douz,
groups can go for a balloon
flight over the Sahara, or ride
scooters over the dunes.
Sweet dates can be bought
here, as well as Berber
jewellery and leather goods.
The tourist zone starts a short
way from the centre, on the
edge of the dunes.

I
N ANCIENT TIMES groups of merchants
travelled along the Silk Road that
linked China with the West.
During the Middle Ages such
caravans provided the only safe
way of travelling across North
Africa and were the sole
means of transporting goods
and merchants, troops and
pilgrims. Tunisia lay at the
crossroads of major caravan routes to the
far corners of the African continent.
Caravans also used mules and
donkeys, but in the harsh desert
environment the camel proved to
be the most effective. As well as
goods, caravans helped the
spread of Islam, the scriptures
and the written language.
Many of the roads that were
once travelled by caravans have
now become highways. It is
possible, however, to join an adventure
caravan and travel over the desert dunes.
Caravans
S O U T H E R N  T U N I S I A

Oases and deep
wells hidden among
the desert sands
ensured a caravan’s
survival. Any camel-
driver is able to lead
the caravan to an
oasis or a well,
without needing to
refer to a map.
Camels have been
domesticated for
thousands of years. They
can drink 130 litres
(28.6 gallons) of water at
a time and go for up to
two weeks without
drinking again. Much of
the camel’s fat is in its
hump, enabling it to lose
heat more easily. The
Arabic language has
over one hundred terms
to describe camels.
Special contraptions facilitated
travel on camelback, while at the
same time protecting the rider
against sun and sand. The most
difficult operations are
mounting and
dismounting. Riders
must hold on tight to the
horn of the saddle that is
placed in front of the hump.
Visitors may go for short trips or embark
on camel treks lasting several days between
oases and ksours, stopping at night in
ghorfas or pitched Bedouin tents.
Present-day caravans still
travel over the sands of the
desert. Their nomadic owners are
able to recognize their camels
just from the camel’s footprints.

Attention! Camels!

The Sahara 7

T
HE SAHARA IS THE world’s
largest desert and
occupies one third of the
African continent (9,000,000
sq km/ 3,474,000 sq miles). It
stretches from the west coast
of Africa to the Red Sea. Its
area lies within 11 African
states, one of them being
Tunisia, which controls only
a small section of the desert.
However, in terms of safety,
transport facilities and tourist
infrastructure this section of
the Sahara is the most
accessible. It is also the patch
of desert that most often
features in the movies.
The image of a desert as an
ocean of sand, stretching off
to the horizon, was created
by fiction writers and film-
makers such as Bernardo
Bertolucci in The Sheltering
Sky. In reality the desert is
more often than not a stony
plain – grey and dull, or an
arid land criss-crossed with
mountain ranges that are

A palm-shaded oasis in the middle
of the desert
which runs all the way from
Morocco. It starts south of
Douz and its most striking
sand dunes can be seen in
the vicinity of Ksar Ghilane.
In the north they are
preceded by vast steppes
occasionally interspersed with
sand dunes which are
bordered by vast, dry salt
lakes. The causeway that
crosses the largest of these –
Chott el-Jerid – is the spot
where mirages are most likely
to occur.
Wildlife is scarce in the
desert. Wild camels are rarely
encountered in Tunisia’s arid
areas. The ones that are seen
are usually part of someone’s
herd. The North African fox,
its ears pointing up like radar
aerials, can now be seen only
in zoos. At times a gazelle
can be spotted. There is no
shortage of desert lizards,
poisonous adders and
scorpions. Here and there,
desert areas feature clumps of
esparto grass, which is used
to make paper and mats.
The driest areas of the
Sahara have no more than
25 mm (0.985 inches) of
annual rainfall. The oases are
surrounded by a sea of sand.
Every scrap of greenery,
every well or pasture, once
belonged to a clan or a tribe
and was cherished, cared for
and fought over. Strangers
were perceived as a threat
and as competition. Even the
sa’alik – the knight errant of
the desert, the intractable
outcast of various tribes –
would join in groups in order
to survive. An expulsion from
a community meant death
amid the sands. Tribal
awareness, although not as
punctuated by mountain
oases such as Chebika,
Tamerza and Mid¯s. 
The Tunisian section of the
Sahara features all three main
types of desert: the rocky
hamada; the pebbly serir and
the sandy erg. The latter,
most frequently associated
with the image of the Sahara
portrayed in films and
literature, lies at the eastern
end of the Great Eastern Erg,
Typical desert terrain near Gab¯s
SAFETY IN THE SAHARA
The rule is never travel alone in the desert, even when
using a four-wheel-drive jeep. There must be at least two
cars, preferably driven by Tunisian drivers. Any excursion
made by car or on camelback must always be reported to
the National Guard and may only be made with their
permission (travel agents can usually arrange these
formalities). Excursions made on foot also have to be
reported and are best made with a guide. It is essential to
take sunscreen products. Also useful are wraparound
sunglasses, a down-filled sleeping bag, a groundsheet, a
pair of loose trousers, a large cotton headscarf that can
cover the entire head and neck from sun and wind, and as
much water as you can carry. High-sided shoes will
provide protection against scorpions.

vital as in the old days, is still
strong. The ties of blood
protected people and gave
them a feeling of security.
Several families descending
from a common ancestor
formed a clan. A group of
related clans formed a kahila
– a tribe. A tribe used to
surround the home of their
chieftain with a circle of tents
– the dawwar – creating
something like a small,
sovereign autonomous state. 
Family, tribes and the
association of tribes formed
the bedrock of Bedouin
society. Warrior-sons and
guards led the caravans,
procured domestic animals
and, in the course of
plundering raids, defended
the honour of their clans and
took women captives. Their
bravery and courage
ensured the clan’s safety
and prosperity. Women
were regarded as the
property of their
families. They
were expected
to be obedient
and bear the
maximum
possible number
of sons. Their
situation
changed for the
better with the arrival of
Islam, for although
Mohammed preserved the
form of marriage that left a
woman in the power of her
husband, he nevertheless set

Time seems to
flow slowly in the
desert. Sand shifts
from one dune to
another. Colours
also shift: white,
occasionally
yellow and golden-red
mounds move along, changing
their shape and position. 
Though beautiful, the desert
can be treacherous. Sand
immobilizes vehicle wheels
and hinders travellers’
legs, while its minute
grains find their way
into camera lenses,
even without a
sandstorm. At the
same time the sand 
is so velvety that it
can be rubbed against
the cheek without
causing a scratch.
Tozeur, Nefta and
Jerba all represent
convenient starting
points for forays into
the Sahara, but to truly
savour the desert
adventure, the best
places to start are
Douz, Zaafrane and
Ksar Ghilane. The
sense of wonder will
not be limited to
sleeping in Bedouin
tents, the proximity of the
desert or the taste of Bedouin
bread baked in the hot sand –
it will also include the sight of
quirky cafés built of old metal
cans or palms, appearing
unexpectedly over dune tops.

DESERT ROSE
This is the most famous and least expensive souvenir of a
visit to southern Tunisia. Sometimes artificially coloured
(in shades of light green, blue and red) its beauty
nevertheless resides in its natural colour – grey bordering
on brown. It is usually found under
several metres of sand. In
chemical terms this is made of
gypsum (crystals of calcium
sulphate) that crystallizes
from underground water
and takes on the form of
an open rose flower.

O
NE OF TUNISIA’S several 
salt lakes, Chott el-Jerid
was created by tectonic
movements of the earth’s
crust some 1.5 million years
ago. It is the largest of the
North African salt lakes
(51,280 sq km/19,794 sq
miles) and lies between the
Gulf of Gab¯s and the
Algerian border. For most of
the year it is dry, with only a
thin layer of water remaining
here and there, becoming an
intriguing desert “carpet” that
consists of minute salt crystals
shimmering with blue, white
and pale-green hues. The
view of the lake at sunset is
unforgettable. Mirages are a
common occurrence. 
The lake can be crossed on
a 64-km (40-mile) long
causeway that is open all
year round. The route links
Kriz (near Tozeur), with
Bechri (near Kebili). It is best
not to stray away from the
road, as the lake bed in this
area may be dangerous. 
Halfway along the
causeway there is a handful
of small cafés, built of reed,
where souvenirs such as
amethyst and desert rose
stones (see p206) can be
bought. These can also
provide toilet facilities. A trip
on the causeway is one of
the main tourist attractions
along the Douz-Tozeur route.

OZEUR IS A MAJOR town
and tourist centre. It
is also one of the
country’s most
beautiful oases
and contains
some 3,000 palm
trees as well as fig
and pomegranate trees
and banana groves.
The town is also
known for growing
the best dates in Tunisia.
They are translucent, sweet
and juicy; nearby
Nefta is also famous
for them. 
The oldest part of
town is Ouled el-
Hadef, which dates
from the 14th
century and has a
distinctive high wall
made of handmade
bricks. The yellow
stones of Ouled el-
Hadef’s houses are
arranged so that they
form Koranic verses
and floral motifs. 
On the outskirts of
Tozeur is a private
museum, Dar
Cheraït, which is
devoted to southern
Tunisia’s history and
everyday life.

A separate section of the
museum transports visitors to
the realm of the Thousand
and One Nights. This
collection of anonymous tales
written over several centuries
includes traces of Indian,
Persian, Egyptian, Greek,
Mesopotamian and Arab
influences. In the Arabian
Nights grotto visitors can
meet, among others, Ali
Baba, Sinbad the Sailor and
Scheherazade. The folk tales
are accompanied by
descriptions of every-
day Tunisian life.
A separate
museum on Rue
de Kairouan is
devoted to local
traditions and includes
costumes used 
in circumcision
ceremonies and a
collection of door knockers
that produce a variety of
sounds (making it possible to
identify the caller). 
Tozeur also has a botanical
garden and a zoo. The latter
provides a rare chance to see
some desert wildlife. 
Planet Oasis, a vast cultural
centre, opened near Tozeur in
2001. Its huge stage, set on
the Saharan sand, has state-of-

accompany musical shows
and other entertainment. The
centre also claims “the largest
Berber tent in the world”.

HE OASIS TOWN OF Nefta is
Tunisia’s second holiest
site after Kairouan. It is
situated on the shores of the
Chott el-Jerid, near Tozeur.
During the Roman occupation
it was known as Aggasel
Nepte; in the 16th century it
became a centre of Sufism (see
below). At that time Nefta had
100 mosques, dozens of
Islamic schools and a zaouia.
Today, it is frequently visited
by film-makers who come for
the unique scenery. It is worth
stopping here, even if only for
one night, to make a trip in a
horse and cart around the
entire oasis or to stroll along
the narrow alleys of Ouled
ech-Cherif.
Ouled ech-Cherif is the
oldest part of Nefta and lies in
the western portion of the
town. There are some
interesting streets and alleys to
be explored here and many of
the houses repay a second
glance. The doors and
window shutters have been
built in a wide range of shapes
and colours and have intricate
fixtures and door handles. The
door handles are often in the
shape of the Hand of Fatima. 
The town wakes up after
siesta, two hours before
sunset. At the foot of the
ancient mosques young boys
SUFISM
Sufism is a branch of Islam
that originated in the
Middle East in the late 8th
to early 9th century and
spread to Central Asia and
India. Followers of Sufism
attempt to arrive at the
Ultimate Truth through the
“shedding of the veil” –
discarding the shackles of
everyday reason and
senses that constrain us.
Some of these devotional
practices, such as walking
on hot coals, have led to
Sufis being distrusted by
other Muslims. 
Ali, a Moroccan-born 13th-
century mystic who founded
one of the earliest Sufi
brotherhoods. It was his fame
that turned Nefta into a major
spiritual centre of the Islamic
world. The reverence which
many Muslims pay to Sidi Bou
Ali is still strong today and his
mystical powers of healing,
passed on to his successors,
continue to attract people to
Nefta. The mausoleum is not
open to non-Muslims.
The date plantations in the
oasis belong to many private
owners. Some will invite
visitors (for a small fee) to
taste the drinks made of palm
juice, or try a cigar wrapped in
palm leaves. Here, visitors can
also find one of the many
oasis springs or go for a stroll
along the shady country lane
that crosses the entire valley.
play football, vendors open
their shops and old men sit on
street benches. With a bit of
luck it may be possible to
strike up an acquaintance with
a local, get invited to a typical
Arab house and in its
courtyard be treated to fresh
dates and camel milk. The row
of restored mosques towering
over La Corbeille – a deep,
palm-filled gulley – is well
worth a photograph. The best
views are to be had from the
Café de la Corbeille.

built on the site of an earlier
Roman outpost, Ad
Speculum. Following severe
flooding in 1969, the old
village was abandoned. Now
the village layout is almost
the same as that of nearby
Tamerza. Small side streets
branch off the main road that
leads to the market. The main
point of interest in Chebika is
its picturesque spring
featuring a small palm grove
and a waterfall, which can be
found a little way beyond the

network of underground
canals that feed the wells).

HIS IS ONE of the three
best-known Tunisian
mountain oases (along with
Tamerza and Mid¯s). All
three villages are situated
near Tozeur, close to the
border with Algeria. As
recently as the 19th century
they were major stopping-off
points along one of the two
main caravan routes that
linked the east and west
coasts of the African
continent. During the years of
the Roman Empire they were
used as military forts where
the legionnaires, making use
of high-rise sentry posts,
communicated with each
other using mirrors.
For centuries the villages
produced only what they
needed to feed their
population. This balance was
upset when phosphate
deposits were discovered
nearby and many people left
their homes to work in the
mines. This also brought
about changes in the local
customs and traditions as
agricultural production
gradually diminished. Even
greater changes were caused
by the onset of mass tourism.
Today, visitors travel in large
numbers to this area, arriving
by jeep for a day trip from
Tozeur. This is also the
destination for those wishing
to take the Lézard Rouge
train route (see p216).

the
“hanging balcony
overlooking the
Sahara Desert”,
Tamerza (sometimes
spelt “Tameghza”) is
the largest of the
mountain oases and
is the only one that
has a public transport
link with the outside
world (buses leave
daily for Redeyef,
Touzeur and Tunis).
It is renowned not
only for its scenic
views but also for the
most beautifully
situated hotels in
Tunisia. The four-star
Tamerza Palace
towers majestically
over a large gorge (a
dry river bed), facing
the white houses and
domes of the old
Tamerza’s waterfall 
can produce apricots,
peaches, pomegranates, citrus
fruit, bananas and olives.
Tobacco is grown in the
shade of the palm trees. 
According to a Tunisian
proverb, the ultimate ruler
here is the rain, and in day-
to-day life water is more
precious than petrol. The
reason the oasis flourishes is
its sophisticated irrigation
system. To ensure local
harmony, the system must
maintain an even distribution
of water to all plots. To meet
this need, Chebika once had
a curious “hourglass room” (it
can still be seen behind the
village’s only public toilet). It
contains a simple timer,
consisting of two large jugs
with handles, painted yellow
with a green stripe (typical of
Berber style). The jugs were
hung from a rope and the
water poured from one jug
into the other. Based on the
time it took for the lower jug
to fill, an attendant would
open and close appropriate
gates within the irrigation
system, sending water to
each arable plot in turn.

increasingly visited by hikers
and photographers. They are
most impressive when the

the light of the setting sun.

opposite side. Guest hotels
and terraces look out onto
magnificent scenery made
famous by the film The
English Patient. Tamerza, like
t
Chebika, was abandoned
following floods in 1969. The
old village is now falling into
ruin but maintains the general
layout of an oasis, including
the main road running from
east to west and a labyrinth
of narrow alleys that branch
off it, climbing upwards.
Several marabouts (Islamic
mausoleums) are still
maintained in the abandoned
village. The most interesting
of these is the mausoleum
of Sidi Tuati, which stands
out clearly amid the
devastated houses. It contains
the holy man’s tomb and
rooms for pilgrims. 
The present sanctuary is
supposed to have been
formerly occupied by a
church. This claim was made
by, among others, the
medieval Arab traveller and
author Tidjani. His belief may
be supported by the presence
of Christian churches which
were active in the Jerid
region in the 14th century.
Some of these inspired the
style of several mosques built
in this area, which clearly
display the influence of an
18th-century Italian style.
Nevertheless the building
materials are mainly local,
including palm tree wood,
typical of the Jerid region.
Another interesting sight in
Tamerza is the pointed dome
of the prayer hall belonging
to the mausoleum of Sidi
Dar ben Dhahara. The

IDÈS IS THE smallest

on the edge of a deep gorge
(it flanks it on three sides).
The gorge’s red-soil floor is
overgrown with lush green
palm trees. The wavy vertical
walls of the gorge present a
particularly impressive sight.
As with Tamerza and
Chebika, the production of
pomegranates, citrus fruit and
dates plays an important role
in the village economy. 
Close to the new settlement
is an abandoned Berber
village. The deserted houses
can be seen on the other side
of the gorge. Next to the
village is a café and stalls
selling souvenirs, such as
desert roses and semi-precious
stones, as well as cold drinks
and mint tea, indicating that
tourism is becoming
increasingly important to the
economy here.

The hills of Jebel Zaghouan and
Jebel Chambi are covered in
dense forest dominated by
Aleppo pine. The oases of Gafsa
grow date palms, and the
fertile areas around Kasserine
are the country’s second
major bread-basket, after the
Medjerda Valley. Little grows
in the harsher parts of the
interior apart from thick clumps of
esparto grass, which is used for
making paper and household items
such as baskets.
Central Tunisia has four major
national parks including Chambi,
where hyena, gazelle and a variety of
birds can be seen as well as many
species of plant.
Central Tunisia’s watercourses often
dry out, but during the rainy season
they rapidly fill with water.
Numerous dams are built to prevent
flooding and to stop the waters
from rising too rapidly. These
also preserve much-needed
fresh water. Temperatures in
this part of the country are
higher than in the Sahel.
Kairouan is the largest town
of the central region. It has
the country’s most famous
mosque and is also a centre
for carpet making. Kairouan is
followed by Le Kef, 45 km (28
miles) east of the Algerian border,
which has always been an
important political centre. During
World War II it was the seat of
government in areas liberated from
German occupation.
Central Tunisia has some of the
country’s most important historic sites
where ancient temples, theatres and
baths from the period of the Roman
Empire can be explored.

UILT ROUND a large oasis on
the border between the
mountain and the desert,
Gafsa is the main transport
hub for the region. It isn’t the
most inspiring of Tunisia’s
towns but the surrounding
area has vineyards, olive
plantations and some striking
scenery. Gafsa itself has a
handful of attractions
including restored palaces
and some baths left behind by
the Romans. 
Gafsa has a long history. In
the 2nd century BC this was a
settlement belonging to the
Kingdom of Numidia.
Destroyed in 106 BC by the
Roman commander Marius, it
was subsequently rebuilt and
turned into a garrison. Under
the Emperor Trajan it acquired
the status of a colony and
became an important Roman
town. It was destroyed in 680
in the course of an Arab raid
but rebuilt by the Hafsids in
the 15th century.

centre of phosphate
mining. It was built by the
French at the end of the 19th
century and lies at the foot of
the Tell Atlas.

were discovered in 1886 by
Philippe Thomas, a veterinary
surgeon in the French army
and amateur palaeontologist.
In 1896 a mining licence was
granted to the Compagnie des
Phosphates de Gafsa.
The main reason to come to
Metlaoui is to climb aboard
the Lézard Rouge, a narrow-
gauge railway line, which was
opened in 1899 by the Bey of
Tunis. The train runs through
the 15-km (9-mile) long Seldja
Gorge and takes one and a

Gafsa’s skyline. The mosque
probably dates from the
Aghlabid dynasty (9th–10th
centuries), although a large
section of the complex was
added in the 14th
century. The prayer
hall is decorated with
blue ceramic tiles.

THE DAKAR RALLY
In 1977 a French motorcyclist, Thierry
Sabine, was taking part in the Abidjan-Nice
motorcycle rally and lost his way. After
wandering about for several days amid the
sands of the Libyan Desert, he was
miraculously found at the last moment.
Thierry Sabine returned to France and
decided to organize a rally that would
provide its participants with a chance to
challenge the forces of nature and their
own limitations. He achieved his aim on 
26 December the same year when drivers
competing in the first staging of the event
set off from Paris heading for Dakar. The
rally was open to anyone who had a
vehicle able to travel over the sands. The
race still takes place and anybody who has
suitable equipment may take part.

T
HE EASIEST WAY of getting to
Sened is from the modern
Sened Gare hamlet, which
once had a railway station.
The village of Sened is tucked
away among the hills of Jebel
Biada (1,163 m/3,816 ft above
sea level). Sened’s houses are
unusual in that they are built
from stone with gypsum
mortar – Berber houses are
usually built with clay. After
they have been harvested, red
peppers are sometimes laid
out to dry on flat roofs. This
area has been inhabited for
thousands of years and nearby
caves were once the dwellings
of prehistoric humans.

N SIDI BOUZID – a small
district capital town – life
passes slowly. Having a glass
of mint tea, a chicha (hookah),
or a game of cards are all
long-drawn out activities.
Much time is spent just
talking. This is not surprising,
since in the summer the
scorching sun can raise the
temperature to 45° C (113° F).
The centre of town has
several modern buildings,
which include offices, shops,
a post office and a hotel. Most
of the town buildings are
single-storey, modest houses
with solid doors.
Sidi Bouzid and the
surrounding area played an
important role during World
War II. In late December 1942
and in the early part of 1943
Sidi Bouzid was the scene of
fierce fighting between the
British 8th Army led by
General Montgomery, and the
Afrika Korps, commanded by
Field Marshal Rommel. 
South of Sidi Bouzid, on the
way to Gafsa, there are some
old Berber settlements spread
along the mountain range that
runs from Gafsa to Sfax.
Situated away from well-
trodden paths, this region has
some excellent hiking areas.
Many of the villages are semi-
deserted and can be reached
only on foot or in a four-
wheel-drive car.

fierce resistance to the French
army before escaping to the
Turkish territory of Libya. It
was several years before the
nomads returned. As well as
refreshments, the café just

the central
Tunisian upland, on the
K
banks of the Oued el-Habeb.
This is a major industrial
town and transport hub.
Since 1963 the town has
produced cellulose and paper
made from the local esparto
grass. Kasserine was
established by the Romans in
the 2nd century AD, and
named Cillium. Following the
fall of the Roman Empire it
lost its status and remained an
insignificant centre for local
villages until it regained some
of its lustre during the period
of the French Protectorate.
The French built a railway
line and expanded the town.
In its eastern section they
erected a new colonial town,
cut across by the long main
street (Avenue Habib
Bourguiba). Even today this
area has most of the town’s
administrative buildings. It
also contains the railway
station (goods trains only),
bus station and numerous
shops. Ancient monuments,
including a large mausoleum,
are found on the other side of
town (towards Gafsa).
A short way out of
Kasserine, next to the Oued
Derb, is the well-preserved
Mausoleum of the Flavii.
The walls of this triple-tiered
monument are covered with
a poetic inscription consisting
of 110 lines; the middle
section has Corinthian
pilasters; above this is a niche
that once housed a statue of
Flavius. The whole structure
was once covered with a
triangular roof. In the western
part of Kasserine, on the
edge of the dry river bed,
there is another mausoleum,
which is now in ruins.
South of the town, to the
left of the road leading to
Gafsa, are the ruins of
Roman Cillium, standing on
top of a hill. Only a small
section of the site has been
unearthed. Its best-preserved

ITUATED CLOSE TO the
Algerian border, Haïdra –
formerly the Berber
settlement of Ammaedara –
was on the trade route that
linked Hadrumetum (Sousse)
with Carthage and Theveste
(Tebessa) in Algeria. The
Romans took control of it
around AD 75 and
established a camp here,
which was used to station the
famous Third Augustan
Legion. Soldiers’ graves can
be seen beside the road.
An ancient road runs
parallel to the modern one
that leads to the site of the
ruins. It is worth visiting the
three-aisle Basilica of the
Martyrs (5th–7th century).
BATTLE OF
KASSERINE
During World War II, on
18 January 1943, the
German 21st Panzer
division, supported by an
air task force, broke
through American
positions at Kasserine,
and advanced towards the
Algerian border. US
troops bore the brunt of
the onslaught and it took
a week of hard fighting
and the arrival of British
reinforcements to halt
what proved to be one 
of the last German
offensives in North Africa.

A capital from the theatre ruins
in Haïdra
relic is a 3rd-century
Triumphal Arch. Nearby are
the foundations of a Christian
basilica, tombs (which are
carved in rock) and a small
Byzantine fortress. The 1st-
century theatre situated on
the slope of the hill affords a
magnificent view over the
surrounding area. 
ENVIRONS: About 15 km 
(9 miles) east of town is
Tunisia’s highest mountain,
Jebel Chambi (1,554 m/
5,098 ft). In 1981 this area
was declared a national park.
Halfway up the slope is a
tourist information bureau
and a small museum. From
Kasserine the GP17 road
leads to the village of Chambi.

BERBER TATTOOS
Berber tattoos are often
associated with magic. The
first tattoo – ayasha (the
one that protects life) – is
introduced immediately
after birth. It is cross-
shaped and usually placed
on the cheeks or forehead.
Tattoos are used for
protection, to ensure good
luck and prosperity, and
also as an adornment. They
are also placed on wrists
and the chest. Women like
to sport fula (triangles) on
their chins.
Jugurtha’s Table – a conspicuous flat rock jutting above the plain
The mosaics that once
decorated the floor are now
kept in Tunis’s Bardo Museum.
Standing to the northeast of
the basilica is the Arch of
Septimius Severus (AD 195)
that was later included in the
Byzantine citadel. This is the
best-preserved Roman relic in
Haïdra. On the other side of
the road are the ruins of a
late 3rd-century theatre, and
further north are the remains
of a basilica dating from
Vandal times.
The best-known historic relic
of Haïdra is the Byzantine
Fort built during the reign of
Justinian (527–565). This is the
largest fortress to be found in
any of the Maghreb countries.
The north side of the fort was
rebuilt in 1840; the south side
was destroyed a few years ago
by floods. At the centre of the
fort are the remains of the
Byzantine Chapel of the
Citadel. To the north of the
chapel are the ruins of the 4th-
century Mellus Basilica, in
which four tombs were
discovered including that of
Bishop Mellus; it is possible
that the tomb of St Cyprian is
also situated here.
Jugurtha’s Table

C
LOSE TO THE SMALL town of
Kalaat es-Senam, this flat-
topped mountain rises
abruptly out of the slightly
undulating landscape that
surrounds it. It owes its name
to the Numidian king
Jugurtha who held out against
the Romans here between 112
and 105 BC. Numidia’s
kingdom was situated in what
is now present-day Algeria
and western Tunisia and
competed with Carthage. In
about 300 BC Numidia fell
under the control of Carthage.
The Numidian leader,
Massinissa, supported Rome
during the Second Punic War,
which ensured a high degree
of political freedom after the
fall of Carthage. Massinissa’s
successor, Micipsa, continued
with this policy. Following the
death of Micipsa, however,
Rome imposed Jugurtha
(illegitimate grandson of
Massinissa) as ruler.
The Arab name of the
mountain (and also the
nearby town) is Kalaat es-
Senam or “Senam’s Citadel”,
which originates from the
chief of the bandits who 
used this mountain as his
stronghold. 
From Kasserine the GP17
road runs towards Tajerouine.
Immediately past the mosque
in Kalaat es-Senam, the road
climbs up towards Aïn Senan.
From there a narrow footpath
leads to the top of Jugurtha’s
Table. The climb takes about
an hour and a half. The trail
leading up the side of the
mountain is spectacular. Its 
last section (a 15-minute
climb) is steep and requires
the use of hands. Standing
immediately before the
summit is a gate built by the
bandit chief. At the top, at
1,271 m (4,169 ft), are the
ruins of a Byzantine fortress,
some troglodyte caves and a
tiny shrine containing the
tomb of an Islamic holy man
– Sidi Abd el-Juada. This is a
popular local pilgrimage
destination. The shrine is
open to non-Muslims.
When setting out, be sure 
to take along plenty of
drinking water (it is not
possible to buy anything
along the route). On reaching
the summit, stop for a picnic
and enjoy the view.

era the town was fortified,
but following the Hilalian
invasions in the 11th century
it was destroyed.
A small museum houses a
collection of tomb steles
(1st–3rd century BC). Some of
these bear Punic
inscriptions and
symbols (crescents,
doves, grapes,
peacocks and fish).

AKTHAR IS SITUATED
between the steppes and
the upland in Tunisia’s second
largest agricultural region
(after the Medjerda Valley). 
It has splendid Roman
remains, which are the most
important in Tunisia along
with Dougga and Bulla Regia.
In the 2nd century BC the
small town of Makthar
belonged to the Numidians,
who built a fort here giving
them control over local trade
routes. Following the fall of
Carthage in 146 BC many
Punic refugees arrived here, 
as the town lay beyond the
borders of Roman Africa.
However, in 46 BC it was
included in the province of a
new Roman territory – Africa
Nova. The Punic and Roman
population coexisted
peacefully. Romanization was
a slow process that took some
200 years to accomplish. The
numerous tomb steles (grave
stones) and the tophets
(sacrificial sites), preserved to
this day, provide evidence of a
considerable Punic influence. 
In the 2nd century AD,
during the reign of Emperor
Trajan, the town was granted
independent status, and under
Marcus Aurelius it became a
colony. The inhabitants were
granted Roman citizenship and
rights on a par with those
enjoyed by the Romans.
Makthar rapidly became the
district’s richest town, and
maintained considerable
Roman Baths with well-preserved floor mosaics
116 to celebrate the town
being granted the status of a
municipium, Trajan’s Arch
overlooks the forum. Beyond
it are the ruins of a basilica
with a baptistry flanked by
four columns. Here, too, is
the tomb of Hildeguns – a
5th-century king of the
Vandals. South of the Basilica
of Hildeguns are the ruins of
the Great Baths (2nd century).
A paved road running
westwards from the Great
Baths leads to the old forum.
Slightly to the north is the
temple of Bacchus (though
only its crypt remains). To the
right are the North Baths,
which have some attractive
floor mosaics. The road
running past the Punic forum
leads to the Schola Juvenus
(AD 88). This was a kind of
youth club where well-to-do
children were taught how to
be good Roman citizens.
Further on is the
temple of Hathor
Miskar (an Egyptian
goddess of love)
and the temple of
Venus; immediately
past this is the
Roman forum,
paved with white
marble. Other
interesting sights
include the 1st-
century AD Punic
mausoleum, which
was turned into a church in
the 4th century and, next to
the Great Baths, some
Numidian tombs. At the very
end of Makthar, beyond the
excavation site, stands Bab
el-Aïn – one of the town’s
oldest gates. Here, close to
the stream, there once
stood a tophet dedicated
to Baal Hammon.
This ancient site was
rediscovered in 1887 by
Captain Bordier, a
French officer, who
founded a new town
that now faces old
Makthar across a
ravine. Set at nearly
1,000 m (3,281 ft)
above sea level, it is a
spectacular spot.

OSAICS
WERE
A popular 
decorative 
element
during Roman times. The
mosaics would have been
laid by travelling teams of
artisans and were used to line
the floors and walls of public
baths and to adorn the fa˜ades
of public buildings. Mosaics
were composed of tesserae –
tiny pieces of stone, marble or brick.
From the 3rd century onwards, wealthy
people began to use them to
decorate their houses. Subjects
were taken from everyday
life, religion, agriculture and
so on. Later on they began to
feature images from mythology
as well as floral and aquatic
motifs. Favourite subjects
included hunting and feasting
and the seasons of the year.
Games, held in amphitheatres, were
also a popular subject.

Ulysses and the Sirens – this mosaic (AD 260) comes from Dougga. 
It depicts the temptation of Ulysses, a scene from Greek mythology.
Animals and plants were frequent
motifs of Roman mosaics. Craftsmen
often used their own colour schemes.
Virgil and the Muses – besides realistic scenes of
everyday life, mosaics often featured images of well-
known artists or rulers. Virgil was the favourite author
of educated North Africans.
Geometric patterns
represented another style
of mosaic art, which
was developing along
with a realistic trend.
This ornamentation is
typical of the later
mosaics, found in
Christian churches.
Neptune’s Triumph – figurative
mosaics from the Roman period used
mainly mythological subjects and
usually portrayed gods.

Following the First Punic War
it fell to Carthage and was
known as Sicca. Later, the
Romans took over the town,
naming it Sicca Veneria as a
mark of respect to the goddess
Venus. Most of the population
fled as a result of a Vandal
raid but the town was slowly
rebuilt and captured by the
Arabs in AD 688. 
With the arrival of the
Ottomans in the 16th century,
the town became known as Le

subject of contention between
Algeria and Tunisia and Le Kef
was the first town occupied by
the French in 1881. During
World War II it was the seat of
the Protectorate authorities,
and in 1942 it was used as the

HUBURBO MAJUS lies in
a beautiful valley
surrounded by hills, and is –
along with Dougga, Bulla
Regia, Makthar and Sbeïtla –
one of the most important
Roman remains in Tunisia,
with many impressive
monuments. A café and toilet
are at the entrance.
The Roman settlement was
established in 27 BC, close to
the Punic town. In AD 128,
after a visit by the Emperor
Hadrian, Thuburbo Majus was
granted the independent
status of a municipium, and
later, in AD 188, it became 
a colony. 
Located on the trading
route between
Sousse and
Carthage,
surrounded by
fertile land,
Thuburbo Majus
grew rapidly. Most
of the public
buildings and
homes decorated
with mosaics date
from the 2nd and
3rd centuries. In the
4th century some of
the buildings were
extended and the
town’s name was
changed to Res
Publica Felix
Thuburbo Majus.
However, the
continuing conflicts
between Donatists and
Catholics, Vandal raids and
finally the Arab invasion led
to the town’s downfall. 
On this site, immediately
past the gate is the forum
(each of its sides is 49 m/161
ft long), which is flanked on
three sides by vast Corinthian
columns. Its most important
feature is the Capitol temple
(one of the largest in Africa),
which is dedicated to Jupiter,
Juno and Minerva. Fragments
of the 70-m (230-ft) statue of
Jupiter are kept in the Bardo
Museum, in Tunis (see
pp88–9). On the forum’s
southwestern side stands the
Temple of Mercury (3rd
century), which has eight
column bases arranged 
in a circle. The southeastern
side of the forum features a
small temple and was once
the site of the town’s
administrative buildings.
The colonnaded exercise yard
Beyond the forum, just to the
right, are the Summer Baths.
These occupy an area of 2.8
sq km (1.1 sq miles). They
were once decorated with
statues of Aesculapius,
Hercules, Mercury and Venus
and with exquisite mosaics
that can now be seen in the
Bardo Museum. The entrance
led to the changing room;
further on was the
frigidarium with three pools,
the tepidarium (the warm
room), the caldarium (the
steam baths) and the
sudatorium (the sweat room).
Adjacent to it was the
Palaestra of the Petronii
(AD 225), an exercise yard
enclosed within Corinthian
columns that is named after
the rich family who funded it.
The letters engraved on the
pavement at the south end
form the board of the “36
letters” game that was widely
used to learn the alphabet.
Higher up the hill are the
Winter Baths, a well-
preserved complex with a
black-and-white mosaic floor.
The southern section of
Thuburbo Majus contains a
temple dedicated to Baal –
the layout indicates Roman
and Punic influence in equal
measures. To the east of it
stood the sanctuary of
Caelestis, which was later
converted into a three-aisle
church. The Roman cellar
became the baptistry and 
the forecourt of the temple
was turned into a cemetery.
Occasionally, a procession is
held here in honour of St
Perpetua, a saint who died a
martyr’s death at Carthage.

AGHOUAN IS A charming
little town that lies at the
foot of Jebel Zaghouan 
(1,295 m/4,249 ft). During the
time of Tunisia’s Roman
occupation the place was
called Ziqua. Little remains
from this period apart from
the large triumphal arch
standing in the main street.
This street has a number of
local restaurants and climbs
upwards to a small square
that is dominated by two
minarets – one octagonal,
one square. The square
minaret was added to the
church building that has been
converted into mosque. A
further climb along a narrow
street to the left of the square
leads to the tomb of the
town’s patron saint Sidi Ali
Azouz (who is also venerated
in Tunis). Zaghouan clearly
displays Andalusian
influences,
following an
influx of
refugees in the
17th century –
house windows
are hung with
light blue
curtains
and drinking
fountains are
decorated with mosaics.
Zaghouan is famous for the
superb quality of its water
and its mountain springs. It is
worth taking a walk further
out of town (about 1.5 km/1
mile), along the road leading
through orchards and shaded
Ruins of the fountain in Zaghouan

Temple des Eaux, a Roman
fountain with 12 niches – one

The fountain was built in the
2nd century AD on the orders
of Emperor Hadrian. 
The small square hall of the
fountain, framed by a portico,
was built next to a spring
(now, alas, dry). On the
opposite side are
water tanks in a

this area was covered with
cypress trees. The northern

repeatedly destroyed and
rebuilt. The town was sacked
during the 11th-century

medina’s walls were not
rebuilt until the 18th century,
when they were reinforced
with twenty round towers.

legend, Sidi Sahab was a
companion of the Prophet

three hairs from
Mohammed’s beard – the
zaouia is sometimes
referred to as the Mosque
of the Barber for this
reason. The vast
courtyard is dominated
by a minaret, which
dates from 1690. The

holy place for Muslims
and a fondouk (inn) was
added in the 17th
century for pilgrims
along with an Islamic
school and 
a mosque.

The tradition of carpet-
weaving in the city goes back
to the 8th century, but it was
only in Ottoman times that
Kairouan became famous for
carpet production. 
The ONAT Museum
(Organization Nationale de
l’Artisanat Tunisien) has many
examples of carpets produced
by nomadic weavers, who
offered their services to richer
nomads. The technique and
the patterns used in these
carpets show strong Turkish
and Anatolian influences. One
of the most distinctive
features of these products is
their red background, with
colourful geometric patterns
surrounded with white cotton
thread. The carpets are
usually made of camel or goat
wool (see p241).
Carpets are on sale in many
outlets in Kairouan but not all
are of the highest quality. 
In an attempt to keep
standards high, the Tunisian
government issues stamped
certificates, which include
information about the article’s
type, size and the date of
production. Such certificates
are a guarantee of a carpet’s
quality. The ONAT Museum is
the ideal place to buy a
certified product, and also to
see examples of antique
carpets. It is also a good
source to obtain reliable
information about the prices
of carpets, and to become
familiar with the details of
their production.

pilgrimage destinations. Sidi
Abbada was an illiterate
blacksmith who was regarded
as a holy man. He was a
colourful character by all
accounts and many legends
and stories about him have
survived to this day. Sidi
Abbada specialized in
prophecies. One of them
predicted that “three vast
scaly snakes, breathing fire
and iron, will surround
Kairouan and finding the
town undefended will enter
it. This will be the
punishment for the
transgressions committed
over centuries by the
inhabitants”. The prophecy
was believed by some to
have been fulfilled when
tanks of the Allied Forces
entered the medina in 1943. 
As well as making
prophecies, Sidi Abbada was
also known for producing
large works in iron. Placed
around his tomb are various
articles made by him
including a giant anchor,
large chains and smoking
pipes. Two giant swords,
believed to protect Kairouan
from attack, were stolen in
1996. A pair of giant anchors
(which Sidi Abbada claimed
to have come from Noah’s
Ark) stand beyond Bab
Djedid, just north of Place des
Martyrs. They are supposed to
attach Kairouan to the earth. 
U Zitouna Mosque
Avenue Ali Zouaoui.
The Zitouna Mosque (Olive
Mosque), although not as
famous as its counterpart in
Tunis (see pp70–71), represents
a typical example of Kairouan
architecture. Its courtyard,
surrounded by a colonnade, is
the forum for religious
discussion and repose. The
minaret that towers over the
mosque has a rectangular
base. Its top section is
adorned by a widow framed
with blue ceramic tiles. It is
worth remembering that
minarets were added to
mosques much later. In the
early days the muezzin called
the faithful to prayer from the
roof of the mosque; only later
on were separate towers built
for this purpose. Formerly,
the voice of the muezzin
reverberated around the
district five times a day; 
these days a recording is
increasingly used instead.

ARPET
WEAVING in
Kairouan goes back
hundreds of years. It is
said that the carpets
produced here were so
precious 
that 
the
Aghlabid princes paid
their taxes in them to the Abbasid
Caliphs. Two main types of carpet are
made in Kairouan – knotted and
woven. Woven carpets
tend to be cheaper. In
the 19th century a loop
stitch was introduced.
Camilla, daughter of
the town’s Turkish
governor, is said to have
taught this to the locals. This type of
carpet features mainly red, blue and
green colours and geometric patterns.
More than
4,000 women
in Kairouan 
are employed  to
weave carpets
(men stick to
selling) and 
work mainly 
from home. At
one time, brightly
coloured carpets
were the main
part of a
bridal dowry.
Carpets sold by street vendors are
predominantly of beige, white and
black colouring. They are decorated with
geometric patterns and floral motifs.
Kairouan’s Carpets
A carpet of Berber design
Mergoum, or woven carpets are
of Berber origin. This type of carpet
has brighter colours and a purely
geometric pattern; it is also much
lighter in weight and is further
decorated with embroidery.
The basic knot
used in Kairouan
carpets is of
Turkish origin.
The value of a
carpet depends on
the number of
knots per square
metre, the quality
of material and
the weaving
technique. Silk
carpets can have
as many as
500,000 knots per
square metre.
Buying a carpet is a ritual, and many
people visit the ONAT Museum (see p237)
for advice. Visitors can also buy carpets
with certificates of authenticity here.

UNISIAN HOTELS ARE mostly of a
good standard and even the
more basic ones are generally
perfectly clean and comfortable.
Independent travellers may like to
consider staying in well-kept, small
family hotels that are located in old
mansions or in one of the former
fondouks
(inns for travelling
merchants). When visiting
Berber villages it is possible to
stay in a troglodyte home, as
many have been converted into small
hotels. Most hotels in tourist resorts
are set in scenic surroundings.
Many offer extensive recreational
facilities and have  modern decor.
Some can dazzle visitors with their
exotic splendour. Hotels situated
away from the main resorts are
more modest. Many are aimed at
Tunisian holidaymakers and do
not provide the same facilities,
such as nightly entertainment.
HOTEL CATEGORIES
H
OTELS IN TUNISIA can be
divided into three
categories: the non-classified
(NC), the classified (from one
to five stars) and those
classified within holiday
resorts. The latter are far
superior to their urban
equivalents in terms of
standards, comfort and
recreational facilities. In
addition, they usually offer 
a beautiful location.
One- and two-star hotels
are sometimes situated in
older buildings which reflect
earlier colonial times.
Sometimes, they are tucked
away in the alleyways of
ancient medinas. Most rooms
have en suite bathrooms or
hot showers. Three-star hotels
are mostly aimed at package
holidaymakers. Four- and
All hotels in tourist
resorts, from three-
star upwards, will
have a swimming
pool but in towns
even a five-star
hotel may not have
a pool.
The choice of
where to stay
includes ancient
fondouks (inns) and
former palaces,
troglodyte homes
and Bedouin tents
pitched at an oasis.
Another category
is the so-called
“hôtels de charme”.
These independently-run
upmarket establishments
generally have a small
number of rooms and offer
chic accommodation. Many
distinguish themselves with
stylistic flourishes such as
minimalistic “designer” decor
or original artwork by
Tunisian artists on display in
the rooms.
When checking into a less
expensive hotel, particularly
in the summer, check if the
room is air-conditioned. At
the very least, it should have
a fan and the use of a
bathroom. If there is a hotel
restaurant, ask for a room
well away from the kitchen or
dining area to avoid the
potential bouquet of smells.

TYPES OF HOTEL
T
HE CHOICE OF hotel in
Tunisia is dictated not
only by its price but depends
also on whether the hotel
caters mainly for independent
travellers or the package
holiday market. As with
almost everywhere in the
world, a package holiday is
usually a less expensive
option but will not always
provide the most interesting
accommodation.

and cost between
40–70 TD per night.
Small and non-
classified hotels cost
around 10–15 TD
per night for a
double room with
an en suite
bathroom. Slightly higher-
class hotels – outside the
peak July and August period
– cost about 22–30 TD for a
double room with an en suite
bathroom. For a room in one
of the cheapest hotels, with a
shared bathroom, it is about 
5 TD per night. These can be
BOOKING
T
UNISIA HAS A large number
of hotels, particularly in
the resorts, so generally
speaking there is no problem
securing accommodation. The
best way to book a hotel
room on arrival is by going
to the ONTT airport desk.
In expensive hotels, even in
Tunis, booking is usually not
required as they always have
plenty of rooms available even
in high season. The situation
is somewhat different with
the many medium-category
hotels and “hôtels de
charme”, where there is often
a shortage of rooms.
Other than through a travel
agent, the best way to book a
hotel room before arriving in
the country is on the Internet.
However, this will involve
making a credit card 
payment for at least one
night. Booking by fax may not
guarantee a room.
Booking a room in a less
expensive hotel is best done
by telephone. Things can go
awry, however, and this
method does not absolutely
guarantee a room.
Plaque of a “tourist-
class” hotel
found in many parts of
Tunisia, including Tunis’s
medina. During the peak
holiday time, however, it 
can be difficult to find
accommodation in Tunis for
under 30 TD. For example, a
double room in a two-star
seaside hotel, with half-board,
will cost about 45–50 TD
during the peak season.
Accommodation in a four-star
hotel during peak times will
be about 145 TD.

TOURIST ZONES
A
TOURIST ZONE
A
(zone
touristique) is a purpose-
built holiday town. The main
advantages of such zones
include their close proximity
to entertainment, lush green
surroundings and direct
access to the sea and beach.
Tourist zone hotels are
generally of a higher standard
than city hotels. Standards of
behaviour are also more
relaxed and visitors may act
much more freely than in
towns or the countryside.
Nobody will raise an eyebrow
at scantily dressed visitors
walking in the streets, or 
at women going topless on
the beach.
Tourist zones tend to be
quieter than towns. Their
location may, however,
disappoint those who put
sightseeing above time spent
under a beach umbrella
because they are rarely close
to the major sights. A definite
disadvantage of tourist zones
is their lack of local cafés and
restaurants serving traditional
Tunisian cuisine. Prices in
tourist zones are generally
much higher than in town.
YOUTH HOSTELS
T
UNISIA OFFERS A choice of
two types of youth hostels:
the auberges de jeunesse
and the maisons des jeunes.
Try to find the former
because they are usually
located in historic buildings
such as fondouks (inns) or
Fairytale shapes of a tourist-zone hotel near Hammamet
palaces. The rooms, often
arranged around flower-filled
courtyards, differ in terms of
size and furnishings. They are
usually quite simple with just
a bed, a wardrobe and a
small table, but they are very
clean. The staff contribute to
a very pleasant atmosphere
though the regulations and
rules can be fairly strict (many
hostels close at 10pm and
allow a maximum stay of
three nights). This type of
hostel includes the charming
auberge de jeunesse on Jerba,
where small cushions
embroided with roses are
placed on each bed. The
hostels are also very popular
with Tunisians.
The maisons des jeunes, on
the other hand, are part of a
charmless, government-run
organization which in high
season usually occupy
schools or colleges. A major
disadvantage of these hostels
is their poor location, well
away from town
centres. A big plus
is the fact that they
can be found in
almost every town.
Many of them have
small kitchens,
which can be used
for a small
additional fee. Both
types of hostel give
preference to
members of the
International Youth
Hostel Association.
A night in a two- or
three-bed room
costs about 3–4 TD.
Breakfast will cost 
1 TD; the remaining
meals about 3 TD.
Swimming pool of a hotel in Hammamet 
DISABLED PERSONS
M
OST TUNISIAN HOTELS are
not accessible to
wheelchairs. Modern hotels
such as El-Hana Beach and
Marhaba Beach in Sousse 
are rare exceptions.
Information on facilities for
the disabled can be obtained
from the Association
Générale des Insuffisants
Moteurs, the main
organization for people with
impaired mobility in Tunisia.
The country’s southern
regions feature marhalas,
which are slightly more
expensive than the typical
youth hostels found
elsewhere. These are excellent
places for a low-budget
overnight stay and are
hospitable, well-equipped and
serve traditional food.
CAMP SITES
T
HERE ARE FEW camp sites in
Tunisia and their standard
is very low. With the
permission of the landowner
or the local authorities a tent
may be pitched on private or
public land, or on a site
belonging to a youth hostel.
There are camp sites in
Remel Plage, near Bizerte, 
in Hammamet (Ideal
Camping), Nabeul (Les
Jasmines), Sousse (Green
Pub), Tozeur (Le Belvedere),
Douz (Paradis), Zarzis (Sonia
Camping ‘n’ Caravanning) and
on Jerba, by the Sidi Slim
Hotel. When travelling in the
south of the country, it is
possible to sleep in a
Bedouin tent for a small fee.

CHILDREN
T
UNISIANS LOVE CHILDREN and
are eager to cater for their
needs and wants. When
planning a holiday with
children ask the travel agent
about hotels that offer
specific entertainment for
families. All tourist zone
hotels will have highchairs
for infants and serve special
menus. They should also be
able to provide a cot, though
few hotels provide dedicated
baby-changing rooms. Baby
food, disposable nappies and
food supplements can be
obtained in local shops. 
Most hotels offer discounts
of between 30 to 40 per cent
for children aged under 10. 
The major resort hotels
usually have well-maintained
playgrounds and shallow
paddling pools. The safest
beaches for small children
are on Jerba and
in Hammamet.

ROM UPMARKET European-style
restaurants to streetside 
vendors, Tunisia can cater for
most tastes and budgets. Perhaps
the best place to enjoy Tunisian
food is in the local cafés. The
spicy Tunisian cuisine served in
many of these unassuming places
often tastes better than in many
expensive hotels. There is no
need to be afraid of eating in small local
eateries as they are almost uniformly
clean and offer good quality. Be aware
that most Tunisian stews and sauces
in traditional cafés are made with
harissa, a fiery condiment that usu-
ally appears on the table without
anyone asking for it. Alcohol is
not generally available and those
restaurants that do serve it tend
to be pricier.  Most major towns
have good produce markets
where a delicious picnic of baguettes,
cheese and fruit can easily be bought.
WHAT TO EAT
T
HE MOST POPULAR Tunisian
dish is couscous – which
is made from semolina and
served with chunky stewed
vegetables, meat or fish in a
hot tomato sauce. Couscous
appears in many varieties; the
most popular is made with
chunks of lamb that have
been cooked with vegetables.
The couscous is placed above
the pot and cooks slowly in a
coucoussier by absorbing all
TYPES OF RESTAURANT
S
IMPLE MEALS OF FISH, chicken,
meat and vegetables are
readily available in gargottes
(small, inexpensive
restaurants), which also serve
soup. Bread and water are
served at no extra charge.
Tourist restaurants, so called
because they have been
inspected and graded by the
country’s tourist authorities,
offer a choice of Tunisian and
European cuisine.
Hotels, especially those
catering for package groups,
offer “international cuisine” as
well as tamer versions of
Tunisia’s spicy stews.
For those who do not wish
to spend much time in
restaurants, snack bars
provide the best answer,

of the steam and flavour from
the stew bubbling below.
Another very tasty dish is
kamounia – an aromatic meat
dish made of beef or lamb
that is cooked with plenty of
cumin and other spices. The
most popular dishes in the
coastal region are grilled
octopus and prawns, and
complet poisson (a whole fish
served with a salad made of
tomatoes, lettuce and peppers).
The most common Tunisian
snack is the brik ∫ l’oeuf (an
egg that has been fried inside
a thin pastry envelope). For
an authentic brik, the egg-
yolk should be soft and the
pastry envelope crescent-
shaped. Sprinkled with lemon
juice and eaten with the
fingers, it makes a delicious
lunch. Another very tasty
snack is Deglet Fatima
(Fatima’s fingers), which are
thin rolls of transparent pastry
stuffed with meat or egg and
then deep-fried. Tunisian
pizza is usually made in large
trays and often topped with
chunks of tuna. Tuna is also

AFÉS ARE USUALLY open
from 8 or 9am until
about 10pm. In small
towns they close a little
earlier. Local
cafés, where men
come to watch
TV and smoke
chichas (hookahs),
usually stay open
until about midnight.
Some cafés remain
open 24 hours a day.

PRICES
T
HERE IS A HUGE
T
difference 
in the prices charged by
T
hotels and tourist restaurants,
and those charged in small
establishments frequented by
Tunisians. Meals in local
restaurants are considerably
cheaper. In a local restaurant
or café a brik ∫ l’oeuf will
cost less than 1 TD, while in a
tourist-zone restaurant it may
cost 3 TD or more. A dish of
couscous will cost about 4 TD
in a local restaurant, while a
hotel may charge 10 TD for
virtually the same dish. A
main course of grilled meat or
a large portion of chicken
with chips and salad will
cost about 3 TD in a local
restaurant and up to 20 TD in
an upmarket restaurant aimed
exclusively at holidaymakers.
A glass of mint tea served
with sugar costs about 
1 TD. English-style tea is
less readily available and
may well cost more
than this. A puff on a
hookah that can be
shared by several
people costs between
2 and 4 TD.
It is best to buy
drinks from a shop.
The lowest prices 
are found in
supermarkets; in
small shops the
cost is normally 10
to 20 per cent more.
HYGIENE
T
OURIST RESTAURANTS have
stringent rules of hygiene.
Local cafés and restaurants are
also usually clean and tidy, as
are the small pavement
restaurants. For the first few
days of your visit, however, it
is best to avoid eating raw
fruit and vegetables as these
can cause stomach upsets.

VEGETARIANS
T
UNISIANS ARE FOND of meat
and find it hard to
understand people who are
willingly vegetarian. In small
local restaurants (gargottes)
and fast-food stands or cafés
it would be difficult to get a
vegetarian meal. Salads are
usually garnished with a
piece of tuna fish, while
soups are invariably prepared
using meat or fish stock.

and is made from chickpeas
and served with bread and

do not normally get
indignant at the
sight of a tourist
eating and drinking
during Ramadan,
but it is good
manners not to eat
or drink in public
places during the
fast. Large towns
usually have a few
restaurants that cater
for tourists. 
Once the fast has
been broken each
evening, it is fairly
easy to find a
restaurant that
serves a Ramadan
dinner. Such restaurants stay
open for a few hours after
sunset and the streets became
deserted while the locals sit
down to a family meal. After
dinner, many families attend
concerts and parties. Some of
the cafés in the medinas open
their doors late in order to
serve a final meal before the
fast begins again at sunrise.

What to Drink
T
HE MOST POPULAR TUNISIAN BEVERAGE is mint tea, which
is drunk often and everywhere. Meals are usually
accompanied by tap or mineral water as well as
all kinds of fizzy drinks (known as gazouz),
z
including the big-name brands as well as local
products. Although a Muslim country, Tunisia
produces good wines, both red and white, an
interesting liqueur and one brand of home-brewed
beer called Celtia. A range of brightly-coloured fruit
syrups is also available that are diluted with water. Fruit
juices are sold in many resorts in the summer.
TEA
T
HE SLOW DRINKING OF MINT TEA is a ritual that is practised
several times a day in Tunisia. Granulated black or green
tea is stewed slowly, with a large amount of sugar and fresh
mint (honey may be used in place of sugar), until it produces
a dark infusion. This is poured from a pot into small glasses,
from a height, so as to create a froth.
Fresh mint leaves or pine nuts are
sometimes added to this.
Tunisian tea is strong and
aromatic and is not to
everyone’s taste though it
is thought by Tunisians to
assist the digestion. Tea is
not often served with milk,
apart from in the larger
hotels or tourist centres
and even these may use
UHT in place of fresh milk.

COFFEE
T
UNISIANS CAN SPEND A LONG TIME over a small cup of coffee as they
contemplate the world passing by and every small café and even the most
humble local bars can serve an excellent espresso. It is often served with small
shortbread or date biscuits. The coffee is strong, but is not always offered with
water, as it is in many countries. Coffee in Tunisia is normally served in small
glasses. Anyone wanting a larger cup of slightly weaker coffee with milk can
order a café direct (similar to a cappuccino) or a café au lait (a filter coffee
with milk). Other popular types include coffee
with condensed milk (Capucin nouveau), not to
be confused with cappuccino and Turkish coffee
(qahwa arbi). This strong, sweet brew is made
by boiling the coffee and is served with the
fine grounds still in it.

MINERAL WATER
U
NLIKE MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES, tap water is clean in Tunisia
and can be safely drunk anywhere in larger towns. Its
taste, however, leaves a lot to be desired and many people
prefer to drink bottled water, which is cheap and readily
available. The most popular mineral water – Safia – is
produced in plain and sparkling versions (the latter is usually
sold in glass bottles). They both taste good and should be
considered indispensable when travelling around the country.
In summer, a bottle of mineral water should always be taken
on sightseeing tours of archaeological sites and open-air
museums to avoid the risk of dehydration.

BEER
T
UNISIA HAS ONLY ONE BRAND of home-brewed beer – Celtia –
which is produced on licence from Stella Artois and
Lowenbrau. It is slightly less potent than European beers, but it
tastes good nevertheless. In shops, Celtia is sold only in red and
white cans. However, not all shops sell beer. Some restaurants
serve beer in bottles but prices tend to be higher than restaurants
that do not serve alcohol. The more expensive
restaurants and hotels offer foreign beers to their
guests, but even here
the choice is limited.
The most easily
available are the
popular brands of
German, Danish and
Dutch beer.

VODKAS AND LIQUEURS
T
HE ONLY STRONG ALCOHOLIC beverage produced
in Tunisia is boukha – a clear spirit made
from figs. It contains 40 per cent alcohol and
resembles a dry fruit-flavoured vodka. It is often
served with fizzy cola. Laghmi is a palm wine
that is fermented for 24 hours. It is not sold in
shops, but it can be obtained from one of the
oases during the palm season. Another
alternative is Thibarine, a liqueur derived from
dates and herbs that is
produced in the
village of Thibar (near
Dougga) according to
a secret recipe
handed down by
French monks.
Cedratine, a liqueur
made from lemons,
is also popular.

LOCAL BEVERAGES
T
HE TUNISIANS PRODUCE their own kinds of fizzy
drink which are sold alongside brand names
such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi. The most popular of
these is Boga, which comes in two varieties. The
dark one is a cola-type drink; the orange one is
more like orangeade. Also popular are syrups that
must be diluted with water. Flavours include
pomegranate and rose essence. Fresh fruit juices
are available in some cafés and in the resorts.

WINE
T
UNISIA HAS BEEN PRODUCING WINE for 2,000
years. New varieties of grape were
introduced in the 1990s and in 2002 a new
range of pricey wines was launched, including
the Château Saint Augustin. Wine is produced in
several regions. These include Cap Bon in the
north, especially around Grombalia and Mornag,
and in the vicinity of Jendouba in the west. The
range of red wines is the safest choice and
includes Château Feriani, Coteaux d’Utique and
Lambolt. Noteworthy among the rosé varieties
are Tyna and Koudiat. The white Coteaux de
Carthage is also very good.

HROUGHOUT Tunisia
there are colourful
markets 
crammed
with all sorts of Tunisian-made
goods including rugs and carpets,
ceramics, jewellery and perfumes.
Tunisia also has large shopping
centres, which have about 
as much charm as their
European counterparts. Shops
selling souvenirs can be found all over
the country. Those aimed at tourists in
the big medinas often charge high
prices and are stocked with poor
quality goods. For this reason,
it is worth stepping into one of
the state-owned ONAT shops.
These will give some idea of the
prices of the most popular
souvenirs. They may also help
to spot poor quality items for
sale in the souks that are sold
as souvenirs of Tunisia but may well
have been made elsewhere.
OPENING HOURS
M
OST TUNISIAN SHOPS close
for lunch; they are also
closed on Saturday afternoon
and Sunday. Some shops 
close on Friday afternoons.
Normally, the shops that sell
food and household products
are open from 8am until
12:30pm and 2:30pm to 6pm,
Monday to Friday. Throughout
the summer season the hours
are 7:30am to 1:30pm.
HOW TO PAY
T
HE NATIONAL CURRENCY is the
Tunisian dinar (TD). In
privately owned shops,
especially those that sell
carpets, payment can often be
made in US dollars or euros.
When shopping for small
items in souks, it is useful to
have some one-dinar coins. In
the state-owned department
stores as well as in larger
shops, shopping centres,
ONAT shops and duty-free
shops, credit cards are
accepted. Credit cards are also
accepted by some upmarket
restaurants and hotels, from
three-star upwards.
When settling a bill in a
restaurant or a café it is
customary to leave a tip. In
cafés this need be no more
than some small change.
Waiters in more upmarket
restaurants will expect about
10 per cent of the total bill. 
Always be prepared to
haggle in a souk. It is often
possible to purchase an 
item for half the price that
was originally quoted by 
the vendor.
WHERE TO BUY
T
HE MOST INTERESTING places
to shop in Tunisia are the
souks, which can be found in
most medinas of Tunisia’s
cities and towns. Prices
charged at these market
shops are not fixed in stone
and are always open to
haggling (see box). As well as
the markets, visitors can also
shop in large, state-owned
department stores. These
have fixed prices and
opening hours. Small hotel
shops usually sell high-quality
goods, but charge top prices
for them. In duty-free shops,
often found at border
crossings, goods must be paid
for in convertible currencies
and prices charged for
Tunisian products are far
higher than those paid in
state-owned shops in souks. 
The Bardo Museum (see
pp88–9) sells good quality
books on the art and history
of Tunisia and North Africa,
as well as in-depth guides to
museums and archaeological
sites all over the country.
A souvenir from Tunisia – colourful desert sands
Tunisia’s state-run department
stores are open from 8:30am
until 9pm, Monday to Friday,
and 8:30am to 10pm on
Saturday. In tourist resorts
souvenir shops stay open until
late at night, and sometimes
until the last shopper leaves.
During Ramadan, many
shops open between 8 and
9am and close at about 1pm.
They open again in the
evening and often remain
open until late at night.

ADVICE ON HAGGLING
Although prices are not fixed in stone,
haggling follows certain general rules.
First of all, allow plenty of time and know
roughly the value of the article required.
Do not hurry. The conversation starts with
general topics, later on an interest may be
shown in some other object. Only after a
while should one approach the article that
is desired. Never mention a price before
the vendor does. A rule of thumb is to
begin negotiations from one third of the
initial price. The seller puts on a show of
indignation, but will lower the price.
Smile and continue with the negotiations,
saying that in this case you will have to
think about it. Walking off will usually
bring about a further reduction in price.
However, stick to the rules of fair play
and continue to haggle only if you really
want to buy the product. If a compromise
is not reached it is only necessary to smile
and bid the vendor a pleasant goodbye.
When buying several items at once,
haggle over each of them separately, and
then in the end ask for an overall
discount. It can sometimes help to be the
first or the last customer of the day.

SHOPPING CENTRES
T
HERE ARE shopping centres
in most of Tunisia’s larger
towns. They are very popular
with the locals, particularly
the younger generation. Their
boutiques stock many
foreign-made goods, but
prices are high and the
quality can sometimes leave
a lot to be desired.
A very popular shopping
centre is the Palmarium, in
Avenue Habib Bourguiba in
Tunis. Situated on its ground
floor (immediately by the
entrance) is an ONAT shop.
The large and popular Zephyr
shopping centre can be found
in La Marsa. This is not only a
favourite shopping venue, but
also a popular meeting place
for young Tunisians. On the
ground floor are restaurants
MARKETS
M
ARKETS were once the
economic centre of
Tunisian towns and were
often given special privileges.
Today, they still play an
important economic role.
Various parts of a market
wake up at different times.
The first to open are the
souks that sell meat and
vegetables; the rest start
trading a little later. Stalls and
shops usually stay open until
about 6 or 7pm, but the main
tourist alleys, such as Rue
Jemma Zitouna in Tunis’s
main souk, remain open
much later.
Tunisia’s markets are often
covered with roofs that
provide shelter from the sun.
A few of the expensive shops,
such as those selling carpets
and gold, are air-conditioned.
Medinas also contain many
small restaurants and cafés
where it is a good plan to
stop for a glass of tea and 
a sit down. One of the most
charming and atmospheric of
these is Café M. Rabet in the
Souk et-Trouk, in Tunis
medina (see p274). When
planning a trip to one of
Tunisia’s markets, if looking
for something specific, begin
by finding out the location of
the appropriate souk, as they
are governed by a hierarchy
(see pp294-5).
It is often worth venturing
further than the main souks.
In the souk situated near
Tunis’s Zaouia Sidi Mehrez
(see p81), for instance, there
are cheap, good quality
ceramics, while in the Souk
el-Grana it is easy to become
caught up in crowds of
women searching for shoes
and clothes at bargain prices.

ART GALLERIES
A
RT GALLERIES IN
A
Tunisia that
deal only in paintings are
A
few and far between and
most establishments sell a
range of artworks, from
graphics and ceramics to
books and sculpture. The
influence of the École de
p
Tunis (see p16) is evident in
most of the contemporary
paintings found in Tunisia’s
galleries. In the 1940s its
pioneers introduced modern
art to Tunisia and began to
combine new trends such as
Futurism with everyday
scenes such as weddings,
markets, and hammams
(steam baths). Alongside
these, there are more
traditional paintings, executed
in watercolours or oils, which
attempt to capture the light
and colour of Tunisian
architecture and landscape.
Also, traditional Islamic art,
including calligraphy and
arabesques, are combined
with more modern techniques
of abstract and figurative
painting. 
As well as paintings of this
type, many galleries sell a
variety of antiques and
contemporary artifacts. These
are not cheap, but every now
and then a gallery has good
quality works by less well-
known Tunisian artists going
ANTIQUES
T
HERE IS A ban on exporting
certain kinds of antiques
from Tunisia. It is nevertheless
worth looking at the shops
that sell them, even if only to
admire the beauty of the
objects. Items such as old
carpets, tapestries, fabrics,
ceramics, traditional wedding
costumes, antique mirrors and
everyday items are not subject
to an export ban. However,
always make sure by asking
the vendor if there are likely
to be any problems with
taking an item abroad.
One good Tunis antique
shop is Ed-Dar, in Rue Sidi
ben Arous; another can be
found at No.7 in the Souk 
ONAT SHOPS
E
ACH LARGE TOWN and many
smaller tourist resorts have
state-owned outlets that sell a
range of Tunisian handicrafts.
The best of them are found in
Sousse and Monastir. They are
well worth visiting in order to
see what products Tunisia as
a whole has to offer. 
ONAT (Organization
Nationale de l’Artisanat)
shops, sometimes referred to
as SOCOPA, sell a wide range
of good quality Tunisian
handicrafts. Prices are fixed
and ONAT shops give some
idea of the prices to pay for
many of the most popular
souvenirs. Another benefit is
that they provide an
opportunity for people to
distinguish the genuine
Tunisian-made article from
foreign imports. 
Some shops, including the
ONAT shop in Sousse, are
vast, and spread over several
floors. As there is so much to
see, allow plenty of time
when shopping for souvenirs
in the large ONAT stores. The
assistants are helpful and
knowledgeable. They will
take great care when
wrapping up the articles, so
that they will not get
damaged during the journey
home. Many of the ONAT
shops are particularly good
for top-quality leather goods.
The ONAT shop in Monastir
offers a good selection of
attractive ceramics. 
All of the ONAT shops can
also provide information on
carpets and tapestries, their
patterns and weaving
ONAT shop selling the highest quality products
for very reasonable prices.
One such shop is the gallery
in Souk al-Caid, in Sousse. It
sells attractive art works as
well as beautiful fabrics. The
Negrat gallery in Rue Sidi ben
Arous, in Tunis, sells good
quality lamps. Galleries
selling contemporary Tunisian
art, as well as work by
foreign artists, can also be
found in Sidi Bou Saïd and
Port el-Kantaoui.

Sidi Bou Saïd

methods; but it is best to ask
about them in Kairouan. 
Another advantage of
ONAT shops is that, having
fixed prices, they present an
opportunity for people who
do not wish to haggle. Most
ONAT shops will accept
credit cards.

JEWELLERY
G
OLD AND SILVER jewellery
is popular in Arab
countries. Common
motifs include crescent
pendants and the hand
of Fatima, which is used
in many different
forms from
earrings to
necklaces. 
Another frequent motif
used in jewellery is the fish,
which is a popular
good luck charm
against the “evil eye”.
Intricate pendants
bearing a motif representing
basmala (an important Islamic
phrase meaning “In the name
of God”) proclaim
membership of the Muslim
community. According to
Muslim tradition, this symbol
figured on the wings of the
Archangel Gabriel as
witnessed by Mohammed. 
Other popular items, beside
pendants, include chunky
bracelets. Coral and amber
jewellery is popular in the
Tabarka region. Items of
jewellery sold in Houmt Souk,
on Jerba, are produced by
Jewish designers. This has
long been a jewellery centre
and is still a good place to
purchase gold and silver. 
Gold and silver hallmarks
should be stamped on every
item. This practice is regulated
by the Standards Office. A
scorpion means that the item
is made of nine-carat gold, a
goat stands for 14-carat gold
while a horse’s head, the
Carthaginian symbol for
money, denotes 18-carat gold.
Silver hallmarks include a

Gold and silver items that
do not bear hallmarks are
of dubious quality but
visitors may wish to buy
them solely for their
attractive designs.
Berber jewellery is
also worth seeking out.
Though Berber jewellery is
usually made of low-grade
silver it is nevertheless
sought-after for the
uniqueness of its
ancient designs.

UNISIA’S MARKETS, which on the surface
appear to be chaotic, are in reality well-
ordered spaces. Every craft and every trade
has its own allocated position and place in a
hierarchy. The closer to the main mosque,
the more numerous are the “noble” souks –
those selling gold, scents, carpets and
traditional Tunisian chechias (hats) worn by
men. Away from the centre, the souks
become less prestigious, producing and
selling wrought-iron products, as well as
trading in meat and vegetables.

Visitors can watch workmen decorating
copper plates. This is supposed to guarantee
its authenticity. For the best quality, try to
find where the Tunisians buy such items.
A Tunisian souk is not only a place to shop
and trade. For the Tunisians it is also a place
of fun and recreation. Meetings with friends in
a café to play a game of backgammon is a
common sight in souks.
Perfume and jewellery can be bought in the
most elegant souks, situated near the main
mosque. They are easy to find as the intense
fragrance of perfumes leads the way. Colourful
and vibrant, these souks attract the most visitors.

Perfume-
making and the
production of
essences have
for years been
traditional
Tunisian crafts.
Rose and jasmine
oils are
particularly
highly valued.
COVERED BAZAARS
Since the 10th century the
main streets and markets of
towns were illuminated
with lamps mounted on
the walls of houses or on
the roofs covering the
streets. In the 11th century
the main streets that run
across the souks began to
branch into smaller ones
that form the present
tangle of narrow alleyways.
This labyrinth was
ventilated by a system 
of roof openings.

2 9 5
Fruit and vegetable markets were
often situated close to town gates to
make trade easier for market
gardeners. They give a glimpse
of present-day Tunisian life.
Weavers’ workshops, as with the
workshops that produce leather or
wooden articles for sale, are often to
be found in the souks, directly behind
the shops that sell these goods.
S H O P P I N G  I N  T U N I S I A
The centre of 
the medina (old
quarter) is the 
site of the most
important souks,
which remain open
from morning until
night with a break
in the afternoon.
It is busy at any
time of day but 
gets particularly
crowded during the
summer, when the
local shoppers are
joined by visitors.
Tunisians like to shop in souks
where they can also buy clothes and
household goods. The shopping ritual
includes haggling and a thorough
inspection of the goods.

What to Buy in Tunisia
Ceramics
The inhabitants of Guellala
on Jerba have long been
associated with pottery and
employ Berber motifs in
brown and beige. Nabeul
craftsmen favour bright
colourings dominated by
blue and green. Berber
ceramics from Sejnane are
also famous (see p134).
T
HERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS on sale in Tunisia.
Much of what is available has been produced by
local craftsmen and it pays to seek out items that have
been made locally such as coral jewellery from Tabarka or
a sea sponge from the Gulf of Gab¯s. Kairouan is famous
for its carpets and leatherware; Nabeul and Jerba for their
ceramics; Sidi Bou Saïd for its intricately made bird cages;
Douz and Tozeur for footwear. If travelling in the south of
the country it is worth looking out for Berber products
including tapestries, beautiful ceramics and silver jewellery.
Perfumes
When visiting a souk that
specializes in perfume
look out for jasmine oil,
as well as oil produced
from the damask rose.
White musk is also of
a good quality. A
small bottle costs
about 5 TD.
Bracelets
Tunisian jewellery is mostly made of
silver or gold. The hedeyed is a wide
bracelet that is worn on the wrist.
Bracelets for the ankles are known as
kholkal and are a symbol of fidelity. The
largest jewellery centres are in Tunis,
Sfax and Jerba.
Woollen tapestry

Shoes
Leather shoes come in a
wide variety of designs. It is
worth looking out for the
traditional balgha, which
are worn mainly in the
south of the country. In the
north a more highly
decorated version that is
worn by women can be seen.

Carpets 
The best places to buy carpets are in Tunis, Kairouan, Tozeur
and Jerba. There are two basic types. Woven (Mergoum) carpets
predate Islam and have Berber origins. They are distinguished
by geometric patterns and sharply contrasting colours. Alloucha
carpets are knotted and feature natural tones. These can be
bought in Aïn Draham in northern Tunisia (see p129).

S H O P P I N G  I N  T U N I S I A
Mosaics
Many of the products on sale in Tunisia stem
from a variety of cultures and influences.
Mosaics are a prime example of this, and most
museums and souvenir shops sell ceramic tiles
reminiscent of the mosaics from Carthage,
Dougga and El-Jem.
Chichas
Hookahs used for
smoking tobacco, can
be bought anywhere
in Tunisia, but the
best ones are produced in
Tunis. Check that all the
parts fit together and
that the air flow is
not obstructed. The
mixture is readily
available. Most
Tunisians smoke
an aromatic
tobacco, flavoured
with such things as
apple or cherry.

Food and Drink
Tunisia produces good-quality wines and
strong liqueurs such as boukha (a clear
spirit made from figs). When exploring a
souk look out for spices and homemade
harissa (a spicy sauce).

Wooden Articles
The best wooden
items are made of

produced in Sfax, these
make good souvenirs,
especially salad bowls
and mortars.

traditional copper

can be bought in
several sizes, up to 
65 cm (26 inches) in
diameter, and in two
types of finishes –
shiny or matt.
Other Souvenirs
Probably the most typical Tunisian
souvenir is a stuffed camel. Every
souvenir shop has a large variety of
them. Other popular souvenirs include
woven mats, baskets, fans and the
ubiquitous leather pouffes.

FESTIVALS
T
UNISIA BOASTS A vast
number of festivals,
which are
celebrated
throughout the
year (see
pp38–42). The
reasons for
celebrations range
from marking the
end of the harvests
to events of
religious or cultural
importance. Many
festivals are of a local
character. Most concerts and
shows are staged during July,
August and Ramadan. 
The big event of the
summer is the Carthage
International Festival. Its
programme is exceptionally

however. The major cities have
many clubs playing good music,
although they are rarely visited
by top performers. Numerous
festivals take place throughout
the year and these are also
worth seeking out
(see
pp38–42). These colourful
events provide the best display
of Tunisian culture and also a chance
to meet some of the locals.
INFORMATION
I
NFORMATION ABOUT major
cultural events and festivals
can be found in French
language newspapers,
particularly La Presse which,
although it does not have
listings pages, has a good
cultural section. The ONTT
(Organization Nationale de
Tourisme Tunisien), with its
main office in Tunis, publishes
a number of brochures
containing information on
annual festivals, which can be
picked up in advance of a trip.
The programme for the
prestigious Carthage
International Festival can be
found in the local press or on
the Internet. In June it is also
available from ONTT
information desks. The
programme of the Medina
Festival, held annually in
Tunis during Ramadan, is
published about three weeks
in advance and is also
available from the ONTT.

in many places throughout
Tunisia. Belly dancing is
extremely popular, as are the
Berber shows and dances. A
good show can be seen in the

CINEMA
G
OING to the
movies is a
popular Tunisian
activity and most
large towns have
at least one
cinema. Tunis has
a good selection
including the ABC and Le
Palace. The programme,
however, is aimed mostly at
young cinemagoers and
consists mainly of action films
shown in Arabic language
versions. American and
European blockbusters are
usually dubbed into French.
Information on programmes
can be found in the cultural
section of La Presse. Ticket
prices start at around 3 TD for
a seat in the stalls. 
CASINOS
C
ASINOS IN TUNISIA are found
only in large towns and
tourist zones. They operate
during the peak summer
season and are open only to
foreigners, though the
staff consists entirely of
Tunisians. 
Two of the biggest are
the Cleopatra in
Hammamet and Casino
Caraibe in Sousse.
Both are glitzy affairs
with a floor-full of
blackjack, poker and
roulette tables, bars,
restaurants and live
entertainment. A new
casino, the Casino de
Jerba, has recently
opened.
In order to be allowed
to play, visitors must
show their passports 
or ID cards. Only
convertible currencies
are accepted. Men are
expected to dress
smartly in a suit and tie.

NIGHTLIFE
T
HE BIG HOTELS usually run
their own entertainment
programmes which include
nightly shows of belly dancing
and performances of malouf
(folk) music. Along with all
this, many hotels
have their own
nightclubs, such as
The Blue Moon
attached to the
Hôtel Hasdrubal
in Yasmine
Hammamet and
Hôtel Topkapi’s
Le Pacha Club
in Mahdia. These
put on shows by
artists from various Arab
countries. Such places can be
expensive and are frequented
mainly by visitors.
The majority of Tunisia’s
clubs are in Tunis. The two
most central are Club 2001
and the Joker Club. Out in
the suburbs, venues such as
the Cotton Club and Queen
tend to play more up-to-date
dance music, and at greater
volume. Outside of Tunis,
clubs tend to be attached to
major hotels such as Abou
Nawas Montazah in Tabarka
and Club Le Rameau in Sfax. 
Similar to European clubs in
music style and decor,
Tunisia’s clubs are popular
with young Tunisians who
can sometimes experience
problems when trying to get
in, either because they are
under-age or do not meet
with the door-staff’s approval.

performances of symphony
music, classical Arab music
and pop music. In addition,
the festival has theatre, ballet,
musicals, operas, cinema and
exhibitions. The main venue
for the events is the Roman
amphitheatre in Carthage (see
pp102–6). Another very
interesting event is the
Symphony Music Festival in
El-Jem (see p163). In the
evenings the amphitheatre
becomes a magnificent
concert hall under the stars.
Hammamet’s Arab Music
Festival, held in July and
August, and the Jazz Festival
held each year at the end of
June in Tabarka are both 
very popular events, as is
Testour’s International Malouf
Music Festival, which takes
place in June.

THEATRE
T
UNISIA HAS only a handful
of full-time theatre
companies. The best-known
and the most prestigious of
the few that do exist is in
Tunis, and performs in the
Théâtre Municipal (see p82).
Its programme is dominated
by plays of European
playwrights, but it also puts on
some Arab (mainly Egyptian)
works. The splendid theatre
building is also a frequent
venue for concerts of both
classical and Arabic music.

CHILDREN’S ACTIVITIES
E
XPLORING ANCIENT remains
such as those at Dougga is
fascinating but not to every
child’s taste. Fortunately, most
hotels in the tourist zones
have beach play areas for
children. These are well
organized and have trained
supervisors to keep young
guests entertained. Activities
in these children’s play areas
range from beach volleyball
and rounders to closely
supervised paragliding taster
sessions. Lessons in tennis
and windsurfing for children
can also usually be arranged.
If staying in the south of the
country children will enjoy a
visit to Tozeur’s Dar Cheraït
museum (see below).
The north of the country has
several funfairs. The best-
known of these is Parc des
Loisirs Dah Dah situated on
the outskirts of Tunis, which
has rides, merry-go-rounds and
other amusements. Parc des
Loisirs Bah Bah on Jerba is a
more modest affair with a small
fairground and bumper cars.

AMUSEMENT PARKS
S
ITUATED CLOSE TO the town
of Bou Ficha, 35 km (22
miles) from Hammamet and
58 km (36 miles) from Sousse
is Park Friguia. This is a
large recreation area, which
combines a small, but well-
run zoo with an amusement
park. It is run by the Tunisian
forestry commission and has a
collection of African animals
including crocodiles, giraffes
and elephants. As well as the
amusement area,
which has all the
usual rides, the park
also includes a
number of restaurants
and a venue for
performances of
malouf (folk) music.
Tozeur has a private
ethnography
museum, Dar
Cheraït, whose
formula vastly
exceeds that of a
mere museum. It is
devoted to the history
and everyday life of
southern Tunisia. A recently
opened section carries visitors
to the world of the Thousand
and One Nights, where they
will meet, amongst others, Ali
Baba and the 40 Thieves,
Sinbad the Sailor and
Scheherazade. This display is
popular with children and
includes secret labyrinths,
ghosts, fire-eaters and a hall
of mirrors. The fairytale
stories are accompanied by
accounts of everyday life in
Arabic countries. The
museum is best visited in the
evening when it is festooned
with fairy-lights.
Park Friguia crocodiles
Planet Oasis was recently
opened in the palm groves
close to Tozeur. This vast
cultural complex consists of a
huge air-conditioned tent
(used for concerts, occasional
receptions and Ramadan
dinners), a row of fountains
and an amphitheatre seating
2,000 spectators. The stage is
built on the Saharan sand,
with the natural backdrop of
palm trees. It makes the most
of state-of-the-art laser effects
to stage spectacular concerts
and open-air events. Planet
Oasis also has regular
displays of handicrafts such as
glass blowing, painting,
leatherwork and pottery.
Tunisia’s largest water park
is undoubtedly Acqua Palace
at Port el-Kantaoui. With
water chutes, slides, drops,
tunnels, whirlpools and every
other kind of splashy fun,
Acqua Palace provides an
enjoyable way for children
both big and small to find
some cooling relief from the
hot Tunisian sun.
Another popular place for
family outings is Belvedere
Park in Tunis. This is Tunis’s
largest park and has plenty of
room for children to let off
steam. There is a small zoo in
its southern section, and also a
small but informative
exhibition on the plants and
wildlife of Tunisia (see p87).
Many children may enjoy a
trip to the Oceanographic
Museum at Carthage where
life beneath the waves can be
discovered thanks to the
numerous aquariums, scale
models, educational boards
and interactive displays.

favourite sport and
men often gather
in large groups to watch
matches live on TV.
Another popular sport
is the annual Dakar

The undoubted star of
Tunisian football is “the

S ELSEWHERE IN Africa,
football is a passion in
Tunisia and it’s not hard to
find a game on television.
Watching football matches is
almost a ritual in many
traditional Tunisian cafés.
Viewers react with great
passion during live
transmissions and the
outcome of a game is a
matter of some importance to
many Tunisian football fans.
Demand for tickets is high, so
anyone wishing to see a
game should arrive at the
ground well before kick-off.
Tunisia’s national team
ranks as one of the best on
the African continent and
won the African Nations Cup
in 2004 when they beat
Morocco 2–1. Tunisian league
teams are also successful and

of the Mediterranean. The
country has five large marinas.
Port el-Kantaoui has 320 spaces
for yachts. Sidi Bou Saïd’s
harbour can accommodate
380 vessels. Monastir’s marina
has space for 386 boats.
HANDBALL
H
ANDBALL IS A game played
on a court similar to that
used in squash. It is popular in
Tunisia and receives plenty of
TV and press coverage. The
men’s team has participated
several times in world
championships and the
Olympic Games, and Tunisia
continually ranks among the
world’s leading teams. The
country will host the Handball
Championships in 2005.
RALLIES
T
HE FIRST PARIS–DAKAR
–
Rally
began on 26 November,
1978, with 170 entrants. Now
the event is known as the
Dakar Rally and traditionally
starts on 1 January, in France.
Each year the route of the
rally, split into several
sections, is changed, but it
always leads through rough
terrain and across the Saharan
sands. The last time the rally
passed through Tunisia was in
2003 when two of the legs
took in Tunis, Tozeur and El-
Borma. Vehicles participating
in this punishing race include
lorries, cross-country cars and
motorcycles. Almost as
popular as the Dakar Rally is
the Tunisia Rally, which also
attracts some of the world’s
top drivers.
ATHLETICS
T
UNISIA HAS MANY talented
athletes. In 2001 the
country hosted the
Mediterranean Games.
The most famous runner in
Tunisia is Mohammed
Gammoudi. Born in 1938, he
became a national celebrity
after winning medals in three
consecutive Olympic Games.
In 1964 he won a silver medal
in Tokyo in the 10,000-m race.
At the Olympic Games in
Mexico City four years later,
he picked up a gold medal for
the 5,000 m, and then took a
silver at the 1972 Munich
Olympics for the same distance.
Tunisian runners have also
achieved numerous successes
in world championships and
excel in medium- and long-
distance running.
The most important sailing
events include an annual race
from Malta (Valletta) to Port
el-Kantaoui and another from
Marseille to Tabarka.
OTHER SPORTS
I
N 2001, during the Judo
World Championships held
I
in Korea, Anisa Lounife
became the first Muslim
woman to win a gold medal
at judo. In recent years
swimming has been gaining
popularity in Tunisia.
Oussama Mellouli was voted
Tunisia’s Athlete of the Year
in 2003 after winning a
bronze medal in the 400-m
medley at Barcelona’s world
championships. The 19-year-
old was the first Tunisian to
stand on the winners’ podium
for a world-ranking
swimming event.
The Tunisian basketball
team is one of the best in
Africa. In 2001 the team
managed to come fourth 
in Africa’s Basketball
Championship. Though the
Tunisian team does not have
many tall players (the tallest is
just over 2 m (6 ft 6 in),
Tunisian players have a world
reputation and have
competed in the Czech
Republic and Poland.
Windsurfing is another
sport that is becoming
increasingly popular in
Tunisia and the country was
represented in the Athens
Olympics for this event.
Volleyball has many
followers and is particularly
popular with Tunisian
women. The high popularity
of this sport is due to several
spectacular victories, such as
in the African Championships
held in Lagos in 1997, when
the Tunisian team defeated
Cameroon 3–0.

PARAGLIDING
A
NOTHER popular
sport in Tunisia
is paragliding and
lessons from
qualified instructors
can usually be
arranged. Having
the right equipment
for this activity is
essential and
should always be
supplied by the
club or instructor.

UNISIA’S CLIMATE makes the
country an exceptional
place for all types of
outdoor activity. Visitors naturally
favour watersports, including
diving and sailing. Tourist zones
have excellent golf courses –
the best ones are in Port el-
Kantaoui, while the most scenic
ones are located around
Tabarka. More exotic sports,
such as paragliding, surfing on the
dunes and sand-yachting on the salt
flats of Chott el-Jerid are specialities of
the southern region. Horse riding on
the beaches of Jerba and Zarzis is a
popular activity, as is camel
trekking across the desert. Tunisia’s
national 
parks 
and 
the
mountains around Aïn Draham
offer 
visitors 
plenty 
of
opportunities for hiking.
DIVING
S
OME OF THE Mediterranean’s
best diving and snorkelling
can be enjoyed in Tunisia.
One of the most beautiful
places to go is the coral reef
off Tabarka where the clear,
warm waters, coral and
seawater beds are ideal for
underwater exploration. Ten
minutes by boat are enough
to get to rocks surrounded by
red coral. A little bit further
on are magnificent tunnels,
grottoes, underwater caves 
and caverns. 
The warm sea and a
vigorous and sustained
programme of conservation
mean that the reef is teeming
with fish and other marine
life. There are as many as six
sites open to divers; each
looks different and requires a
different level of ability. 
The yacht club in Tabarka
and the International Diving
Centre organize excursions to
the reef for more experienced
divers. The most popular site
is Roche Merou – the Miller’s
Thumb Rock – where divers
can swim amid rainbow-
OTHER WATER SPORTS
T
UNISIA IS A great place for
windsurfing, which can be
T
enjoyed all year round,
although between December
and April it is advisable to
wear a wetsuit because the sea
is so cool. One of the best
windsurfing schools is situated
in Sidi Bou Saïd. Favourable
conditions for the sport are
also found in Hammamet,
Sousse and on
Jerba. Seaside tourist
resorts offer water
skis for hire.

Tunnels Reef, is less than 20
minutes from Tabarka and
comprises a complex of
tunnels, caves and caverns
some 18 m (60 ft) below sea
level. Club de Plongée, which
is by the yacht jetty in
Tabarka, also organizes taster
excursions for total beginners
as well as a 7-day course for
less experienced divers. They
also rent out boats and diving
equipment. Tabarka is not the
only place where it it possible
to go diving, however. The
International Diving Centre in
Port el-Kantaoui is open all
year round and provides
facilities for more experienced
divers as well as running
courses for beginners. Ideal
conditions for exploring the
beauty of the underwater
world can also be found in
Hergla, 15 km (9 miles) north
of Port el-Kantaoui. Most
diving clubs insist that divers
are over 14 years old.

CYCLING AND
MOTORBIKE TRIPS
M
ANY HOTELS OFFER bicycles
for hire and tourist resorts
also often run bike-hire
services. Always check the
condition of the hired bicycle
before accepting it (usually it
is far from perfect). Jerba and
the coast of Sahel are ideal
areas for cycling. If cycling
around the country, take a set
of spare parts such as inner
tubes as there are practically
no service and repair facilities
outside the main towns.
A motorbike is an ideal
vehicle for exploring the
country. However, there is
only one rental firm in Tunisia
– Holiday Bikes on Jerba.
Anyone wishing to hire a
motorbike must be at least 21
years of age and hold a valid
motorbike driving licence.

HUNTING
T
HE FORESTS AROUND
T
Aïn
Draham are popular with
T
hunters in search of wild boar.
The season lasts from October
until February. Hunting 
also takes place around El-
Haouaria, Sbeïtla and
Zaghouan. Special licences are
required and can only be
obtained by people who are
part of an organized tour.
Wild boar hunting around 
Aïn Draham
journey is a five-day trek from
Douz to Ksar Ghilane. Shorter
rides are also available and
for a few dinars it is possible
to enjoy an hour-long camel
ride which, for some people,
is quite enough.
The price per day (which
includes all the necessary
equipment and meals) is
usually about 30–35 TD. An
hour-long ride costs far less.
When embarking on a
camel trek take a down-filled
sleeping bag (nights are cold
in the desert), a rolled-up
sleeping mat, a pair of loose
trousers and a large cotton
scarf to protect the head and
neck from the sun and wind.
A flask containing water is, of
course, indispensable. A tasty
snack for the camel may also
come in handy.
Another very important item
when travelling in the desert
is a well-stocked first-aid kit.
As well as pain-killers, it is
also advisable to carry a
general antibiotic, a snake-
bite serum, antihistamine 
and a remedy for gastric
conditions. Also don’t forget
sunglasses, eye-drops, sun-
block lip cream and large
quantities of sun-cream.

HIKING
T
UNISIA’S NATIONAL PARKS are
splendid hiking grounds.
An ideal place for this type of
activity is Ichkeul National
Park – one of the largest
wintering sites for birds in the
whole of the Mediterranean
basin (see pp136–7). Jebel
Ichkeul, on the lake’s south
side, has a number of sandy
footpaths leading through hills
overgrown with wild olive
trees. In the spring it can be
carpeted with wild flowers.
Another great place is the
Boukornine National Park.
Situated near Tunis, it is full of
Persian cyclamens that flower
in the spring. Excellent
conditions can also be found
in the Khroumirie Mountains
(see p130), near Aïn Draham,
where it is possible to climb to
the top of Jebel Bir (1,041 m/
3,415 ft) and the Col des
Ruines overlooking the village.
Ideal months for such a trip
are April, October and
November as the temperature
is then cooler. In December
and January, however, night
temperatures can drop to
freezing. March brings
sandstorms, while July and
August are far too hot.

GOLF
A
LTHOUGH TUNISIA
A
does not
have many golf courses,
A
its climate is exceptionally
favourable for the sport.
Tunisia is firmly established
on the international golf
circuit and many people
come to the country with the
sole purpose of playing golf.
There are a handful of top
quality golf courses available.
All of these offer a good
range of facilities, including
equipment hire, bars and
restaurants. Friendly
instructors are ready to assist
those new to the sport. 
Many hotels can arrange
transfers to and from courses
and also pre-set teeing-off
times. Few of the clubs have
stringent membership
requirements though some of
the larger ones may ask for a
valid handicap certificate
before they will allow a new
player on the course. Failing
that, a letter of introduction
from a home club will often
be sufficient.
The top golf course in
Tunisia is the El-Kantaoui.
HORSE RIDING
H
ORSE RIDING is available in
many seaside resorts in
Tunisia as well as in the areas
close to the hotels that run
their own riding stables. 
The most popular place for
horse riding is Jerba. The
island also has the greatest
number of riding stables.
Here, it is possible to gallop
for hours along virtually
deserted beaches. Horse
riding at sunrise or sunset can
be an unforgettable experience.
Riders on a beach in Jerba
This 36-hole, professional
course has a championship
layout that winds through the
olive groves opposite the
marina. Twenty minutes from
Tunis is the 18-hole Carthage
Golf Course, which was
founded in 1927. Two top-
quality 18-hole courses are

OTHER ACTIVITIES
T
HERE ARE FEW facilities for
extreme sports in Tunisia.
Nevertheless, there are plenty
of attractions for those who
seek high-octane thrills. Most
of them are associated with
the southern regions of the
country and with the Sahara.
Thrill-seekers should
certainly try sand-skiing and
sand-yachting. The latter is
carried out on the dunes
around Kelibia and Douz,
while sand-skiing is practised
in the El-Faour oasis, 30 km
(19 miles) from Douz. The
hard bottom of the dry Chott
el-Jerid salt flat is perfect for
the use of sand-yachts.
Any kind of flying is also
very popular in Tunisia. The
Sahara Desert offers good
conditions for hang-gliding
(although it is best to have
your own equipment) and for
flying light aircraft. These
sports are, however, rather
expensive and depend very
much on the weather. 
located in Monastir and
Hammamet, while in Bir Bou
Regba, near Hammamet, there
is a 9-hole course. Jerba also
has a golf club, which
comprises three 9-hole
courses. Tabarka’s golf course
is in the tourist zone and is
set in a picturesque landscape
of eucalyptus and olive trees
overlooking the coast. The
club features an 18-hole, 72-
par course and a 9-hole
practice course for less
experienced players.
THALASSOTHERAPY
T
UNISIA IS SECOND only to
France in terms of its
thalassotherapy facilities. This
treatment uses hot seawater
combined with seaweed or
mud in order to alleviate such
common ailments as stress,
rheumatism and arthritis.
Many people enjoy it for its
own sake, however, and
thalassotherapy centres tend
to be attached to hotels that
also run life-enhancing
programmes such as quitting
smoking. They usually also
promote healthy eating in
their restaurants. Three of the
best are the Abou Nawas,
Sousse, the Residence Hotel,
Carthage and the Hasdrubal
Thalassa, Hammamet.

as some of the most
unpredictable weather occurs
at this time. The daytime
temperature may be 25° C
(75° F) one day, and
suddenly drop to just a few
degrees above freezing the
next. On windy days the cold
can feel acute, particularly on
the Cap Bon peninsula and in
the northern regions of the
country. These cold spells
never last long, however. 
In the main, the best
seasons for visiting Tunisia are
spring and autumn when
sightseeing can be combined
with sea-bathing. The best
time to visit the south is from
early September until May, but
trips to the desert should
ideally be undertaken in
September, October or March,
when the daytime temperature
is 25–28° C (77–82° F). The
main festival period is in
summer. During Ramadan the
shops stay open until late.
Concerts and poetry evenings
are held at numerous venues
in the medinas of Tunis and
Kairouan. On Jerba, the
holiday season lasts most of
the year, though the sea cools
off towards the end of October.

UNISIA IS A
visitor-
friendly place and,
in its outlook, is
probably one the the most
“Western” of all Islamic
countries. Within the
tourist zones visitors may
behave as they would at
home. When venturing
further afield, however, it is important
to be aware of local attitudes and
customs. For instance
exposed shoulders and
the wearing of miniskirts
by women are considered
inappropriate. Mosques,
particularly prayer halls,
are not open to non-
Muslims. Although Tunisia
is a Muslim country, it
follows the European calendar and has
adopted Sunday as its day of rest. 
WHEN TO VISIT
H
OLIDAYS CAN BE taken in
Tunisia at any time of the
year. The hot summer season
lasts from May until early
October, although the heat is
moderated by the sea breezes
on the coast. Summer is the
best time for sunbathing on
the beach and swimming. If
venturing inland or to the
south of the country,
however, then it can get
unbearably hot during the
summer months; the heat is
particularly intense in the
mountain valleys. 
In autumn, cold currents
coming from the northwest
Atlantic can bring wind and
rain. Then, the temperature
drops to 20–24° C (68–74° F),
though the sea remains warm.
The most rainfall can be
expected in the north. 
During winter the days are
warm and mostly sunny, with
temperatures between 16 and
24° C (61 and 75° F), but be
prepared for weather changes

LANGUAGE
A
RABIC IS THE official
language of Tunisia, but
French is also in common use
and most educated Tunisians
are practically bilingual. The
staff working in tourist zones
will usually also speak
English, but in the hinterland
English is virtually unknown,
apart from a handful of basic
in larger towns. Small
information desks are also 
in some selected museums.
Some of them hand out free
pamphlets and detailed road
maps, but there is not likely to
be much detailed information
from these small ONTT offices
regarding sightseeing,
transport or obtaining hotel
accommodation. The ONTT
also has an office in London,
however, which can provide
information on all aspects of
Tunisia (see p247).

phrases. In the main markets
almost all languages can be
heard. This is especially the
case with shopkeepers and
their assistants, who
endeavour to encourage
tourists to buy in as many
languages as they can think
of. Tunisia’s Berber
population has kept its own
language, though they also
usually speak Arabic. Tunisian
children are generally able to
speak French, as this is taught
in school from primary level.

HOSPITALITY
A
S A NATION
A
, Tunisians are
family-orientated and
A
welcoming. It happens
frequently that Tunisians will
invite foreign visitors to their
homes or ask them to
participate in their
meal. There is no
need to be afraid to
accept such an
invitation, but try to
assess whether it is
not purely a gesture
of politeness. The
first expression of
Tunisian hospitality
is to offer the guest 
a glass of mint tea.
Accepting tea in a
shop does not oblige
the customer to
purchase anything.
Offering tea is, of
course, part of the
sales technique, but
it also arises out of
Arab traditions of
hospitality.

CLOTHES
M
ANY TUNISIAN women wear
European clothes,
particularly in cities. Typical
office dress consists of a skirt
and a jacket. Young people
dress in styles similar to those
found in European countries.
The official dress for a man 
is a suit. 
Traditional Tunisian attire,
including the veil, is worn
mainly by older women and
is more common in the
provinces. Berber women
living in Chenini wear red-
and-white checked veils. 
The red chechia hat is often
worn by men to complement
a traditional garb consisting of
a loose robe opened at the
chest and covered with a
large wrap. Sometimes a
chechia is worn with a
Western suit. Often,
traditional clothes are
reserved for religious
ceremonies, and are more
commonly worn by persons
associated with religious
organizations.
Although many Tunisians
have adopted Western dress,
visitors should avoid short
skirts, shorts and clothes that
leave the shoulders or chest
exposed. To help avoid
unwanted attention, women
may wish to wear a headscarf.
In tourist zones visitors are
freer to wear what they like,
but if exploring the country-
side be aware that exposure 
of the body is frowned upon
by many Muslims.
MEALS
B
REAKFAST TENDS TO be a light
meal in Tunisia, consisting
of milky coffee and French
rolls or cakes. The resort
hotels, however, usually offer
a large selection of dishes for
breakfast. Lunch is also light,
and is taken between noon
and 3pm. It may consist of
brik ∫ l’oeuf (egg inside an
envelope of pastry) or a main
course with salad. 
In Tunis and in a few large
towns, some restaurants have
special lunch menus; these
are usually offered at reduced
prices. Dinner is eaten in the
evening, around 8pm. There
is no need for any misgivings
about eating in small cafés
and restaurants – in fact,
dining in such humble places
can be preferable to eating in
upmarket restaurants or
hotels as the food is likely to
be more authentic. The food
served in the big tourist
hotels is often more adapted
to European tastes, with a
wider menu and lighter use of
spices. Bread and water are
Customs and Etiquette 
A
LTHOUGH OPEN TO NEW IDEAS, Tunisians cherish their
traditions, observing the Ramadan fast and
celebrating Muslim feasts with great ceremony and
devotion. Many Tunisian men enjoy spending their
time in cafés, playing games and smoking chichas
(hookahs). Women spend much time within their own
family circles. Visits to hammams (steam baths) are
popular. Pre-wedding customs including a “henna
night” are also widespread.

couscous. It comes in several
varieties; the most popular of
them are made with lamb or
chicken and vegetables.

discouraged by Islam,
alcohol and beer drinking are
permitted in Tunisia, but
these drinks are sold only in
specially-licensed shops and
bars. The latter tend to be
very much male, smoke-filled
refuges. Alcohol can also be
bought in the state-owned
department stores at a
separate counter, which often
has shorter opening hours
than the rest of the shop. It is
also on sale at some, but not 
all, restaurants. Many
supermarkets sell alcohol,
though it may be harder to
purchase on Fridays. If
buying alcohol from a
supermarket be discreet and
carry it in a closed bag.
Drinking alcohol openly in
the street is likely to cause
offence to many Tunisians.
Tunisian beer and spirits are
generally served only in the
more expensive restaurants.

HERE IS NO PROBLEM with
taking a camera to Tunisia.
Some Tunisians, however,
may object to having their
picture taken so always ask
for permission first. This
applies especially to Tunisian
women and when taking
pictures of people in rural
areas. Be aware, too, that
taking pictures (inadvertently
or not) of airfields, military
installations, police stations or
other government buildings
may lead to arrest.

Islam including
Adam and Jesus.
Mohammed is the
greatest of the
Muslim prophets in
that he revealed the
direct word of God,
which is written
down in the Koran.
Islam plays an
important part in
Tunisian’s cultural
life. Prayers are said
when a baby is first
born and a few
days later there is a
ceremony which
involves shaving
the baby’s head.
Circumcision for
boys is carried out
at about 12 years of
age. Islamic weddings take
place in the summer. When a
Muslim dies a simple
ceremony is held in the
mosque. The body of the
deceased is buried with the
feet facing towards Mecca.

their chichas (hookahs). The
latter are generally smoked at
noon, in the afternoons and
in the evenings. Usually one

is not unusual to see two men
puffing away at the same
pipe). Smoking a pipe is
accompanied by sips of
strong tea served with fresh

HEALTH AND HYGIENE
T
UNISIA IS A COUNTRY where
restaurants maintain high
standards of hygiene. This
applies not only to the big
hotel restaurants, but every
small café that offers a quick
meal will have a washbasin.
Tunisians wash their hands
before and after eating. Food
poisoning is rare. 
Despite this, visitors may
experience stomach problems
a few days after arriving in
Tunisia. The usual symptoms
are fever, shivering, general
weakness, and diarrhoea.
Usually this is not a case of
food poisoning, but the body’s
reaction to the sun and the
different diet and climate. This
type of problem may be
PERSONAL PROPERTY
T
HEFTS IN HOTELS are rare but
it is recommended that
any valuables be stored in a
safe or at least kept out of
sight. Every hotel employs

only opens the doors, but also
stops any stranger
from entering the
premises.

M
OST VISITORS TO TUNISIA will
experience no serious problems
with crime. The streets and hotels
are discreetly patrolled by security
guards and plain-clothes policemen.
This high level of safety is due to
untiring official vigilance, especially
in the tourist zones. Crimes, such
as groping, against women do
happen, but are rare. Even so, a
woman travelling alone risks a degree of unwanted
attention. The greatest danger is posed by the sun;
ignoring basic safety precautions may lead to severe
burns and sunstroke.

They may set up road blocks,
stop cars, check documents
and the contents of the car.
Tourist cars and coaches are
usually not checked, but a
hired car may be stopped.
Visitors must then present
their documents and explain
the purpose of their journey.
Although this may seem
excessive, it has to be
remembered that Tunisia
shares borders with Algeria
and Libya. The police are mainly
on the lookout for smugglers,
arms dealers and terrorists.
With tourists’ safety in mind,
police stations have been built
in virtually every tourist zone.
If visitors are a victim of a
crime, they should request a
police certificate (a copy of
the police report) in order to
claim compensation from their
insurance company.
Beaches are patrolled around
the clock to make sure that 
no unauthorized persons use
this means to enter the hotel
compound. Thefts are usually
committed by outsiders,
arriving from other parts of
the country. 
A lost or stolen passport
should be reported to the
Sûreté. In markets, trams and
other crowded places be
especially vigilant about
pickpockets. In some of the
larger resorts, such as Sousse,
Jerba and Hammamet, it also
pays to keep personal
property out of sight. In
places such as the narrow,
crowded alleys of the
medinas (old quarters) avoid
carrying valuables in a
handbag or backpack. It is
better to keep wallets or
purses under a shirt. The
safest method is to use an
inside pocket in a shirt or
jacket that is fastened with a
separate button or zip. Be
aware, also, when on the
beach – sleeping tourists can
sometimes fall victim to
pickpockets or bag-snatchers.

avoided by keeping out of the
sun and reducing the
consumption of raw
vegetables and salads,
particularly during the first few
days of a visit. Prior to leaving
home be sure to provide
yourself with remedies for
diarrhoea. The most important
thing when suffering from an
upset of this kind is to replace
the fluid that is lost. In the
course of such an illness drink
plenty of bottled water.
There are not many public
toilets in Tunisia. Most are
usually at petrol stations. In
an emergency look for a
restaurant or a hotel. It is
worth carrying a roll of toilet
paper for such an eventuality.  
The greatest health hazard in
Tunisia is the sun. In
summer always keep
the head covered and
avoid long
exposure. Another
danger is heatstroke,
which is particularly
likely in the desert, and in
the mountain valleys.
Among the signs of
heatstroke are
disorientation,
headaches and a
high body temperature
without the other signs of
fever. When out in the sun,
drink plenty of water. In larger
towns the tap water is fit for
drinking. Try to avoid drinks
that have been chilled too
much as these can also upset
your stomach. 
During desert trips wear
ankle-length boots to protect
against scorpion bites.

BANKS
T
HE COUNTRY’S MAIN bank is
the Central Bank of
Tunisia – Banque Centrale de
Tunisie. There are also a
number of state-owned
banks. The first private bank
– Amen Bank – was
established in 1995. Branches
of Tunisian banks can be
found all over the country.
There are a number of foreign
banks, which also offer a full
range of services. 
Banks are usually open
Monday to Thursday, from 
8 to 11:30am and from 2 to
5pm; between July and
August they are open from 8
to 11am. Opening times are
shorter during Ramadan. In
larger towns, during Ramadan
the longest opening hours are
offered by small branches of
the Amen Bank – some even
stay open until 4pm. Banks
remain closed during Muslim
holidays as well as during
state and national holidays. In
the tourist areas banks are
often open longer for visitors
to exchange money.
for exchanging money,
especially in rural areas.
It is illegal to take Tunisian
currency out of the country,
or to bring it in. Visitors who
have not used all their dinars
by the time they are ready to
leave may change back 30 per
cent of the total sum, but not
more than 100 TD, on
presenting the original proof
of exchange. It is therefore
worth changing only small
sums of money at one time
and keeping all the exchange
receipts, including the ones
issued by ATMs. Foreign
currencies in excess of 500 TD
should be declared on arrival.
It is worth remembering
that even luxury hotels that
quote their prices in euros or
US dollars on their websites
or in brochures can only
accept cash payments in
Tunisian dinars. 
CREDIT CARDS AND
TRAVELLER’S CHEQUES
B
ESIDES CASH, most large
shops and hotels, as well
as the tourist-orientated
restaurants, will accept
payment by the major credit
cards including Visa,
MasterCard and Eurocard.
Some of the more upmarket
restaurants also accept Diners
Club cards. Cards are not
accepted at petrol stations.
Cards can also be used to
draw cash from a bank. Most
banks will want to see a
passport before they do this.
Please note that credit cards
are often required when
checking in at some of the
more upmarket hotels.
Another form of payment is
traveller’s cheques, such as
those issued by American
Express or Thomas Cook.
These are accepted at most
banks and many hotels. If
traveller’s cheques are lost or
stolen this should be reported
to the issuing company’s
Tunisian office. Most
companies should be able to
replace lost traveller’s
cheques within 24 hours.
EXCHANGING MONEY
B
ANKS AND MOST large hotels
in Tunisia can exchange
the main world currencies,
including sterling, euros and
US dollars, into Tunisian
dinars (TD). The exchange
rate is determined on a 
daily basis by the Central
Bank of Tunisia. Differences
in the exchange rate between
banks are negligible, and
involve only the commission.
The private Amen Bank
usually offers a slightly better
rate. Hotels give less
favourable rates, but even
here, the difference is never
very large.
In addition to the banks
there is also a network of
bureaux de change, which are
usually more convenient than
a bank. They can be found in
many parts of the main towns
and tourist zones and are
often open longer than banks.
There are a number of
automatic exchange machines
(though these are still few
and far between) which
change foreign currencies into
dinars. Money can also be
changed at some post offices.
If venturing away from the
main tourist areas, however, it
can be harder to find facilities

T
HE NATIONAL CURRENCY is the Tunisian dinar (TD). The
exchange rate is fixed on a daily basis. This can be
looked up in the local paper but at the time of
publication 2 TD is roughly equivalent to £1. The TD
cannot be traded, like the US dollar or UK pound, and
it is illegal to either import or export it, so Tunisian
currency cannot be purchased before arriving. All of
Tunisia’s larger towns, provincial capitals and tourist
resorts have banks and bureaux de change.

OST OFFICES IN TUNISIa offer the whole
range of postal services and can also
be used to send a fax or make a
telephone call. More convenient,
however, is the system of public
phones, known as taxiphones, which
can be found all over the country –
these can be used to phone abroad.
Foreign newspapers and magazines are sold in Tunis,
Tabarka and Bizerte, as well as tourist areas of the
Sahel. The French language version of La Presse, the
national daily paper, is available everywhere. 
The most practical solution is
provided by taxiphones.
These are small telephone
exchanges found in almost
every town and village.
Identifiable by their yellow
signs, there are several booths
and attendants who can
supply change. They can be
used to make a call (from a
coin-operated phone) or to
send a fax. Taxiphones are
very popular and have an
extensive network. Calls
made from taxiphones are
much cheaper than ones
made from hotels. Most
Tunisian public telephones
are coin-operated. Telephone
calls are cheaper between
8pm and 6am. 
Making an international call
from Tunisia is also fairly
straightforward, although it
can be costly. To dial abroad
from most public phones, first
dial the international code 00,
followed by the country code,
then the local code and
finally the number. The
country code to dial Tunisia
from abroad is 216.

as only the subscriber’s
number need be dialled.
When making a long-distance
call within the country,
precede the number with 7,
followed by the appropriate
area code, e.g. 1 for Tunis, 2
for Bizerte. When calling a
Tunis number from Bizerte,
for example, dial 71, followed
by the number. Telephone
boxes can usually be found
near post offices. Some shops
have public phones
(identifiable by their blue

are expensive (this applies to
telephones installed in guest
rooms and reception areas).
A telephone call made from a
post office is cheaper than one
made from a hotel, which
charges a higher rate for the
first three minutes.
INTERNET
A
LTHOUGH THE INTERNET
A
has
been in operation in
A
Tunisia since the late 1990s, it
is still not widespread, though
its use is steadily growing.
Access to the net is provided
primarily by the state-owned
Publinet company. It now has
over 280 branches throughout
the country (including the
southern regions), where
Internet terminals are
available for use by the locals
and visitors to the country.
Internet terminals can be
found in the larger towns and
are usually open between
8am and 8pm, daily. They are
expensive, however, and do
not offer discounts for
frequent use or long
connections. Schoolchildren,
students, disabled persons
and journalists are entitled to
a 25 per cent discount.
An alternative to the
Publinet branches is to visit
one of the European-style
Internet cafés. These are still
rare but can be found in
larger towns, particularly in
Tunis (one is located close to
the railway station at Rue de
Gr¯ce 4, near Place
Barcelone). Their opening
hours are longer (often
8am–midnight), and their
prices are comparable with
those of Publinet.

POSTAL SERVICES
T
UNISIAN POST OFFICES are
easy to recognize by their
yellow boards inscribed with
the letters PTT. Postboxes are
usually yellow too. There are
post offices in all sizeable
towns. Stamps can be bought
from them and letters, parcels,
telegrams or cash can be sent
abroad. Overseas telephone
calls can also be made from a
Tunisian post office.
The Tunisian postal system
is reliable. Letters to Europe
take seven to 10 days. Letters
take about two weeks to the
USA and Australia. Post offices
also provide an express mail
delivery service (Rapide Poste)
which guarantees delivery
anywhere in Europe within
two working days.
Some hotels have a system
whereby they collect their
guests’ mail in decorative
cages situated in the reception
areas. Hotel staff then take
them to the post office.
Stamps can be obtained
from newspaper
kiosks and from
the larger souvenir
shops. Stamps are
also often available
from taxiphone offices.
During the summer, post
offices are open Monday
to Saturday, from 7:30am until
1pm. Throughout the rest of
the year they are open from
8am until noon, and again
from 3 to 6pm. On Saturdays
post offices are only open
from 8am until noon. During
Ramadan, post offices are
open from 8am to 3pm,
though these opening hours
can be subject to change.
THE PRESS
E
UROPEAN MAGAZINES and
newspapers are readily
available in Tunis from 
large hotels and at various
newsagents throughout the
city centre. They usually arrive
one day late. There are three
French-language newspapers
published in Tunisia (La
Presse,e Le Renouveau and Le
Temps) and one weekly
s
English-language magazine,
Tunisia News. La Presse, in
e
particular, is a valuable source
of information. Its weekend
edition has a large cultural
section, which contains the
programmes of cinemas,
shows and other current
cultural events. Alongside
these, it also publishes reviews
and announcements for all
major forthcoming attractions.
Le Temps puts more of an
emphasis on international
events; La Presse is good for
coverage of sporting events.

one national

Channel 7, which is broadcast
to a number of other countries
via satellite. Channel 7
transmits exclusively in Arabic,
except for a daily news
broadcast in French at 8pm.
For the rest of the time, the
schedule includes frequent
studio productions, game
shows and Friday night films.
Though the output of Channel
7 is not going to appeal to
everyone, it does give an
insight into Arab customs. 
It is also worth watching the
frequent transmissions of
contemporary music concerts,
recorded at the Carthage
Festival of the Medina, for
instance, or live studio
performances of malouf (folk)
music. These broadcasts not
only provide some good
quality Arab music, but also
demonstrate how deeply such
music is rooted in Tunisian
culture.
Rai Uno and France 2 are
two additional TV channels
received throughout much of
Tunisia. Such terrestrial
channels are now under
threat from the increase in
privately owned satellite
dishes, which provide access
to a huge number of
international channels. Tourist

MOST convenient
way of getting to
Tunisia is by air; there
are frequent scheduled
services 
year-round
from the UK, France 
and other European
countries. Tour operator
services, often using charter flights, and
usually including accommodation and
airport transfers, are competively priced
and can represent excellent value
when compared with scheduled
airfares. If planning to take a
car, travelling by ferry from
France or Italy, book
tickets well in advance
as ferries can be very
busy, especially in
summer. Overland travel via Algeria or
Libya, which can be difficult to arrange,
is not recommended.
AIR TRAVEL
F
LIGHTS TO TUNISIA from the
UK take about three hours.
Tunisia’s national airline is
Tunisair, which operates
direct scheduled flights from
London Heathrow to Tunis
four times a week. British
Airways/GB Airways also
has four services a week,
from London Gatwick Airport.
Alternatively, it is possible to
fly indirectly via Paris or
Amsterdam, with connections
from several UK regional
airports. Tunisair and Tuninter
have connecting flights from
Tunis to Monastir, Sfax, Jerba
and Tozeur. There is also a
new direct service, weekly on
Sundays, operated by
Nouvelair between London
Gatwick and Monastir. There
are no direct services
between the Republic of
Ireland and Tunisia; it is best
to travel via London or Paris.

TRAVELLING FROM
THE AIRPORT
T
UNIS CARTHAGE AIRPORT is a
short drive from the centre
of Tunis. A taxi ride to
Avenue Habib Bourguiba
should take about 15 minutes
(depending on the traffic) and
cost not more than 5 TD.
Taxis are plentiful and the
competition is fierce. The
price of a taxi ride is likely to
go up at night or during the
rush hour. Negotiate the cost
before getting into the taxi.
An alternative means of
getting from the airport to the
town centre is by bus. The
No. 35 bus leaves twice an
hour. It takes about 30
minutes and terminates at
Tunis Marine station on
Avenue Habib Bourguiba.
The bus also makes drop-off
stops at Avenue Habib

and Port el-Kantaoui); and
Jerba (9 km/6 miles from the
island’s capital Houmt Souk).
All three are able to handle
large numbers of flights and
passengers. Tunisia’s other
airports are at Sfax, 112 km
(70 miles) south of Monastir;
Tabarka, on the coast close to
the border with Algeria; and
Tozeur, in Tunisia’s western
desert region.
and Australasia, the
fastest routings are
likely to be via
London or Paris.
Apart from
scheduled flights, a
wide range of charter
flights is offered by tour
operators direct to Monastir
from London and selected UK
regional airports. These
include Luton, Birmingham,
Manchester, Newcastle and
Glasgow; travel agents can
provide details.
Prices vary according to
season and are highest in July
and August. Short-notice
spring and autumn bookings
can prove excellent value,
and it is possible to save
money by booking online via
an airline or one of the
discount travel websites. On
all airlines weekend flights
usually cost more.

getting to
Tunisia is by ferry.
A
Between July and the end of
September there is a regular
car ferry service from
Marseille to La Goulette –
Tunisia’s main passenger
port. Two companies,
CTN and  SNCM, handle
most of the crossings. In
July there is also a
weekly service to Bizerte.
Throughout the rest of
the year there are two to
three services a week. The
journey from Marseille takes
24 hours. It is also possible to
sail to La Goulette from Italy.
The ferries sail from Trápani
(Sicily), and also from Genoa,
Naples and La Spezia. The
weekly service from La Spezia
(100 km/62 miles southeast of
Genoa) to La Goulette is
much cheaper than sailing
from either Genoa or Naples.

OVERLAND TRAVEL
I
T IS POSSIBLE to travel to
Tunisia overland, from
Algeria or Libya, though it
requires a special visa, which
must be translated into Arabic
if travelling through Libya.
There is a daily bus service
from Tripoli to Tunis that
takes about 16 hours. A daily
bus service from Tripoli to
Sfax takes about 10 hours.
There is also a louage (shared
taxi) that runs from Annaba in
Algeria to Tunis’s medina.
Although people do travel
to Tunisia via Libya or
Algeria, the border regions 
of these two countries can be
dangerous. Furthermore,
since the outbreak of the
civil war in 1993 Algeria has
been practically out of
bounds to tourists.

TOUR OPERATORS
O
VER 60 TOUR operators offer
packages to Tunisia from
the UK and Ireland; many are
specialists while others offer
only flight and beachside
hotel packages. In addition to
hotel, apartment and self-
catering accommodation, tour
operators can arrange car
rental, golf packages and
private transfers. Holiday
durations can vary from
weekend breaks to month-
long winter sunshine
vacations. Special interest
holidays range from golf,
hiking, deep-sea diving and
desert adventures on a camel
to archaeology, gastronomy
and thalassotherapy.
For those people interested
in a particular activity,
booking through a specialist
operator can work out
cheaper than organizing
something once in the
country. The Tunisian Tourist
Office in London can provide
a comprehensive list of tour
operators (see p247).

The main routes run from
Tunis: north to Bizerte (about
2 hours); west towards the
Algerian border (about 6
hours); southwest to the Tell
region (about 6 hours), and
south to Sfax and Gab¯s, via
Hammamet and Sousse. The
most popular line is the one

UNISIA HAS A WELL-DEVELOPED road network. Air-
conditioned buses provide transport links between
most major towns. A more convenient way of travelling
is by louage (shared taxi). These travel between many of
the small towns and villages and operate more
frequently than buses. On shorter routes to villages,
visitors will need to take a taxi (only yellow ones). Much
of the rail network (SNCFT) is devoted to freight. The
passenger trains that do run, however, are comfortable
and punctual. The main routes run south from Tunis to
Sfax and Gab¯s. Tunisia has a number of internal flights,
run by Tuninter. The most popular routes are those that
connect Tunis with the south of the country.
Travelling Around Tunisia
distance trains usually have
an additional Grand Confort
class. This is more expensive
than first class and offers
travellers slightly more
exclusive compartments. 
Long distance trains usually
include a restaurant car,
where a hot meal, sandwiches
and drinks are available.
When planning several train
journeys, consider buying the
Blue Card that gives unlimited
travel within the country.
These are valid for one, two
or three weeks and can
represent good value. Costs
are: one week – 19.50 TD
(second class), 27.50 TD (first
class); two weeks – 39 TD
(second class), 54.60 TD (first
class); three weeks – 58.50
TD (second class), 81.90 TD
(first class).
There is also a ticket that
gives unlimited train travel
within the country and free
entry to the major museums.
This Rail-Museum Card costs
28 TD (second class) or 35
TD (first class) and is valid for
one week.
Timetable details are
available in the daily press,

Sahel is another convenient
service and runs between
Sousse, Monastir and Mahdia.
A local service, called the
TGM, runs from Tunis to
many of its suburbs including
Carthage, La Goulette and Sidi
Bou Saïd.
Most Tunisian trains have
two classes. First class is
about 40 per cent more
expensive than second class
and is air-conditioned. Second
class is usually very crowded
and in order to be sure of a
seat it is best to board the
train at the first stop. Even the
suburban trains include first
class carriages, which are
generally less crowded and
have soft, padded seats. Long-

AIR TRAVEL
T
HERE ARE AIRPORTS in Tunis,
Monastir, Sfax, Tozeur,
Gab¯s, Gafsa, Tabarka and
Jerba. The most popular
routes are between Tunis and
Jerba (several flights a day),
Tunis and Sfax and Tunis and
Tozeur. In the summer there
are also flights to Gab¯s and
Gafsa. A one-way ticket costs
about 50 TD. There is also an
air-taxi service, Tunisavia.
This is often used by VIPs
and businessmen and lands
not only at the major airports,
but also at a number of small
regional ones.

There are two types of louage
– the ones marked with a red
stripe are allowed to travel all
over Tunisia; the ones with
blue stripes are permitted to
travel only on local routes. 
Tunis has three main louage
stops. Louages departing from
the square in front of the
south station (Bab Alleoua)
go to Cap Bon; the ones
leaving from the stop at the
east end of Rue Aid el-Jebbari
travel south. From Place Sidi
Bou Mendil yellow louages
marked with a white
stripe go to Libya
and Algeria.
BUSES
T
HE SOCIETE NATIONALE de
Transport Rural et
Interurbain (SNTRI) is the
state-owned bus company,
and runs services between
most of Tunisia’s towns.
Services to the smaller towns
run once a day. There are
about 10 daily services from
Tunis to Sousse, Hammamet
and Sfax. The price of a bus
ticket is comparable to a
second-class train ticket. In
the summer, due to the hot
weather, long-distance buses
sometimes travel at night.
Buses are more comfortable
than louages and offer plenty
of space for passengers and
their luggage. They are also
air-conditioned. In addition to
SNTRI, there are also a
number of suburban carriers,
serving various local villages
and small towns. There are
quite a number of these
smaller companies and it can
be difficult to obtain
information about their
schedules. Quite often one
town is served by a number
of carriers and the staff of one
will not always know about
the timetable of another
carrier, even if they operate
from the same bus station.
Tunis has two main bus
stations. Bab Saadoun serves
the north of the country and
is at the bottom of Rue Sidi
el-Bechir and Avenue 9 Avril.
Bab Alleoua, sometimes also
referred to as Bab el-Fellah,
connects Tunis to the centre
and south of the country and
is just south of Place
Barcelone. A transport link
between the two stations is
provided by the Nos. 50, 
72 and 74 buses.

HARED TAXIS ARE A popular
form of transport in
Tunisia, covering the whole
of the country. Louages do
not run to any particular
schedule and depart only
when they have a full
complement of passengers (in
practice one never need wait
long). Though they are less
comfortable than buses, they
offer greater convenience.
The price of a ride is only
fractionally higher than that of
a bus ticket. Louage stops are
usually situated near the bus
and railway stations.

TOWN DRIVING
A
LTHOUGH TUNISIAN drivers
are generally careful, pay
particular attention to
motorcycles and pedestrians
when driving in towns. This is
especially true during the
rush hours, between 5 and
8pm and at night. Pedestrians
can be disconcerting in towns,
giving the impression that
they have not seen oncoming
vehicles. Drivers should use
their horn if in doubt as to
whether other road users are
aware of their presence.

HIGHWAY CODE
T
UNISIA’S HIGHWAY CODE does
not differ significantly from
mainland Europe. Vehicles
drive on the right, and
overtake on the left. The road
signs are clear and mostly
bilingual (French and Arabic).
The speed limit is 90 km/h (55
mph) on open roads; 50 km/h
(30 mph) in towns and built-
up areas. The only stretch of
road where it is permitted to
travel at 110 km/h (70 mph) is
the toll motorway running
between Tunis and Sousse.

ROAD SIGNS
I
N ADDITION TO THE commonly
seen road signs there are
warning signs with a picture of
a camel. These are seen mostly
in the south and warn about
the possibility of encountering
one of these animals on
the road. Take heed,
too, of the signs
warning about the
danger of wet
surfaces during or
after a period of 
heavy rainfall. 
A frequently-seen sign in Tunisia –
Warning! Camels!
The crowded centre of Sousse
A-roads are known as Routes
Nationales (RN), and B-roads
are referred to as Routes
Regionales (RR). Surface
damage on RN roads is rare.
Even on the RR roads,
potholes are few and far
between. Outside the summer
season, however, some of the
roads may become
impassable due to rainfall.
Roads in the south are not so
good, but are still passable. 
Driving on desert roads
requires a four-wheel-drive
vehicle. Whilst driving in the
desert, always travel in a
group of at least two cars (to
assist each other in
case of breakdown).
Also bear in mind
that desert roads 
can suddenly
disappear if they
get buried in the
sand. When this
happens it can
be difficult to see
in which direction
to drive. Because
of the dangers,
trips to the desert are best
undertaken with a Tunisian
driver who knows the area.
Warning sign –
Stop!
T
UNISIA’S ROAD NETWORK IS EXCELLENT, with clear signs
and well-maintained surfaces for most of the
country. The traffic regulations are almost the same as
in Europe. The standard of driving is good, too, as
Tunisian drivers do not tend to travel too fast. They are
usually ready to offer help in case of a breakdown.
There are numerous police patrols on the roads.
Generally they do not stop tourists, but visitors should
nevertheless carry their passports with them at all
times. Hiring a rental car is an excellent way of
exploring Tunisia, though it can be fairly expensive. 
Travelling by Car in Tunisia
Seatbelts are supposed 
to be worn at all times in
Tunisia. Frequent patrols and
heavy fines ensure that
Tunisians rarely exceed speed
limits or break the rules of the
road. In fact, the main
hazards on the roads come
from straying animals,
motorcycles and pedestrians. 

CAR RENTAL
C
AR HIRE FIRMS are in all of
the major towns and
tourist resorts. Their services
are rather expensive, but
hiring a car enables you to
visit many interesting and less
accessible parts of the country.
There should be no
problem with finding a major
rental firm; Avis, Azur,
Europcar and Hertz all have
offices in Tunis and
elsewhere. The best option,
however, is provided by local
firms – these are cheaper and
are often more willing to
strike a deal. Prices start from
about 60 TD per day for a
small car, plus 250 millimes
for each kilometre travelled.
Though it may mean having
to pay a higher daily rate, it
can work out far cheaper to
hire a car from a company
that does not charge extra for
the distance travelled,
especially if intending to use
the car for long journeys.
Rental companies will
require that the driver be 
over 21 years old and hold 
a licence that has been valid
for at least a year.
When hiring a car it is
imperative to check that the
vehicle documents include an
accident report form. In case
of an accident both parties
are required to complete such
a report. Visitors who do not
fill out the form may be liable
for the costs, even if the
accident was not their fault.

BREAKDOWNS
AND ACCIDENTS
T
UNISIA HAS NO roadside
telephones or road
emergency services. In case
of a breakdown ask another
driver for a tow to the nearest
town or village where there is
a garage able to repair the
car. Alternatively, it may be
necessary to wait for a
passing police patrol. Repair
services are cheap in Tunisia,
but parts can be expensive.
In the case of a serious
accident, such as one involving
injury to a pedestrian, the
driver should endeavour to
contact the police. The driver
may be detained and should
contact his or her Embassy in
Tunis as soon as possible.

Generally, there are no
problems with finding
somewhere to fill up with

Generally, however, the maps

accurate and include
additional information in
English and French relating to
historic sites. The range
published by the ONTT
includes maps of Carthage
and Tunis’s medina. The
ONTT offices can also provide
street maps of a number of
the other most popular towns.
When travelling by car
around Tunisia purchase a
more detailed road map
before leaving. Michelin
produces a good one (No.
956), as do Freytag and
Berndt. Both are on a scale of
1:800,000 and provide
information on Tunisia’s
major and minor roads.
The situation can be worse
when there is heavy rainfall.
At these times it can be better
to resort to walking instead.

TAXIS
T
UNIS’S YELLOW TAXIS are a
cheap and efficient means
of getting about. Many locals
use them and it can sometimes
be hard to find a free cab for
this reason. All taxis are fitted
with meters. In general, the
drivers stick to the meter,
apart from journeys to the
airport that start from bus
stations or the railway station.
A trip from the town centre to
the airport will cost about 
5 TD; a taxi to the Bardo
Museum will cost about 3 TD.
At night (from 9pm–5am) the
prices can be slightly more.
Always check that the meter
has been activated, though it
is rare that a taxi driver will
attempt to swindle his fare. 
Taxis can be hailed from
the side of the road, just as
they can in other major cities.
It is worth paying attention to
the condition of the car,
however. Some of Tunis’s
taxis are old and rather
dilapidated. Most, however,
are new and well maintained.
It is worthwhile holding out
for a new model, particularly
if intending to travel a bit
further, to Sidi Bou Saïd or
Carthage for instance. 
As well as hailing a taxi, 
it is possible to book one by
phone. This is especially
useful for trips to the airport
when carrying a lot of luggage.
Hotels are usually able to
arrange this.

TRAMS

RAMS ARE probably the
most convenient way of
moving around Tunis. This
network, known as métro
leger, runs down the middle

of the street and has green
paintwork with distinctive
white and blue stripes. The
city’s trams are efficient and
not particularly expensive,
though they can be crowded,
especially at peak times.
Five main lines run to
various parts of Tunis. All
except No. 5 pass through the
centre. Since many streets in
central Tunis are one-way,
the tram often returns by a
different route (usually along
a parallel street). Tickets must
be purchased before boarding
the tram and are available
from the kiosks at the
entrance to each station. The
standard fare is 380 millimes.
Line No. 1 runs from Tunis,
Marine via Place Barcelone,
to Bab Alleoua, at the south
end of the town. Bab Alleoua
is the best stop for the
southern bus station.
Line No. 2 runs from Place
de la République and heads
north towards Ariana.

RANSPORT WITHIN TUNIS includes a variety of options.
The furthest corners of the city should be accessible
without any problem, if not by public transport, then

can easily be explored on foot. Travelling to seaside
resorts close to the capital is also quite easy. The best
way of getting to them is by using the fast TGM train
that stops near the town centre. 
Getting Around Tunis

GUIDES
T
HE QUALITY OF service
provided by Tunisian
guides varies tremendously.
When somebody offers to act
as a guide for free, it is
practically certain that the
person works for a carpet
shop or a store selling some
other kind of merchandise.
The trip will therefore end
very quickly in one of the
medina’s markets. However,
employing guides who work

TGM TRAINS
A
N EXCELLENT WAY of
exploring Tunis’s environs
and the coast of Carthage is
by taking the TGM train that
links the centre of Tunis with
Carthage, Sidi Bou Saïd and
the main beaches. The train
leaves from the end of
Avenue Bourguiba (Tunis
Marine station). The journey
to the final station (La Marsa)
takes about 35 minutes. The
first station after crossing the
causeway is Le Bac.
Confusingly, Aeroport, the
sixth stop, has nothing to do
with the airport as TGM trains
do not run there. Salammbô
has a nice beach,
while Carthage
Byrsa is the main
stop for Carthage’s
Museum and Byrsa
Hill. Sidi Bou Saïd
(see pp96–7) is an
excellent stopping-
off point, as is La
Marsa, which has the best
beach in the vicinity of Tunis.
The ticket costs about 600–
800 millimes. Many people
opt for the first-class ticket,
which is only slightly more
expensive. The first train on a
weekday leaves before 4am,
and the last runs about half
past midnight (slightly later at
weekends). The departure
times of the last trains should,
however, be checked at the
station – in Tunis, Sidi Bou
Saïd or La Marsa.

WALKING
T
HE CENTRE OF TUNIS, like
most towns in Tunisia, is
fairly compact. At its heart is
the medina, much of which is
closed to traffic. A stroll

DRIVING
D
RIVING IN TUNIS is not a
good idea. Unless there is
no alternative, don’t even
consider it. Despite being
wide, all the main streets of
town get congested. Tunis’s
drivers show little respect for
marked traffic lanes and it
often happens that a three-
lane road suddenly becomes
an impromptu five-lane one.
Police help or understanding
cannot be counted on either.
Policemen only try to ease
the traffic flow at the most
congested junctions. If stuck
in traffic, pay particular
attention to motorcycles and
pedestrians that often weave
in and out of the stationary
cars with little apparent
concern for their own safety.
Although Tunis’s drivers
undoubtedly break many
regulations, it is very rare for
them to break the speed limit.
If attempting to drive in town,
remember that many streets
are one-way, and getting to a
destination may not be as
simple as it appears from the
map. There may also be
serious problems when
parking. Pay close attention
to the paid parking zones, as
there are severe fines for not
paying the required amount.
at archaeological sites, such as
Dougga or Bulla Regis, can be
particularly useful if the details
of the site and its history are
of interest.
around the medina can be a
real pleasure and enables
visitors to soak up the ancient
atmosphere at a leisurely
pace. In parts of the medina
where the streets are
relatively wide, visitors should
be on the alert for scooters or
delivery vans, which can
arrive at speed. Tunis’s Ville
Nouvelle is also suitable for
exploring on foot. The only
problem with this area is the
heat in summer. To avoid
heat exhaustion, walk on the
shady side of the street and
carry a bottle of mineral
water. Anyone who feels tired
should sit down in a café and
have a drink.
Outside Tunis, there is no
sense in walking the large
distances that separate many
of the towns from the tourist
zones, unless it is to walk
along the seashore.
