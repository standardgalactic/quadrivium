About the Author
Juan Manuel Ferreyra is an illustrator and animator from Buenos Aires, Argentina. He is 
34 and lives with his cat. Although he started drawing at a young age, computers caught all 
his attention, and he worked in the IT world for many years. He dropped out from Computer 
Engineering and started studying filmmaking, working on his own projects and as a freelance 
illustrator in his free time. After a few years, he decided to leave the IT world and started 
working as a full time freelance illustrator and animator; his website is http://www.

Este libro es para mis abuelos. BIG thanks to my good friend Buanzo for 
introducing me the fine people at Pack Publishing: Dilip and Joel, thanks for 
your support and understanding. Thank you everyone.

About the Reviewers
Nedo Laanen graduated in 2003 from college where he studied Applied Mathematics 
& Computer Science. After a trip to Rajasthan (India), he started working full time in the 
computer industry for a large agency, where he worked for several clients as a Novell System 
Administrator. Soon he developed a keen interest in Linux and Open Source software and 
started to pursue a career as a Linux professional at Stone-IT in Utrecht. Nedo worked for 
companies like the Dutch WWF in Zeist and the Dutch Council for Refugees in Amsterdam, 
as well as for several Dutch hospitals. He was also involved in the 'Antonius Open' project at 
the Antonius hospital in Utrecht. A prestigious project of the Antonius hospital to cut back 
costs by implementing Linux and Open Source software on their computer network, replacing 
expensive proprietary software and eliminating vendor lock-in.
In 2007, Nedo went on a trip to Thailand with his girlfriend Reeta and several of his friends. 
For the occasion, he bought a digital SLR camera to document his journey. From that moment 
on his interest in digital photography started growing exponentially. He followed several 
courses in digital photography and learned the rest from the internet and by just doing it. 
Being a Linux professional, he manages and processes all his images on his Linux desktop 
using Open Source software like the GIMP, Geeqie, Ufraw, and qtpfsgui. 
Nedo started a website in 2009 named OpenSourcePhotography.org (http://www.
opensourcephotography.org/). He wanted to share his knowledge of Open Source 
software in conjunction with modern day digital photography by posting news on his blog and by 
giving reviews on Open Source digital photography Software. His goal is to show amateur and 
professional photographers alike that Linux and Open Source software is not scary and difficult 
to use. Being a photographer himself, he can reduce costs by using Linux and Open Source 
software in his photography, thereby lowering the prices for his clients.
I would like to thank Packt Publishing for granting me the opportunity to 
help them with the GIMP 2.6 Cookbook.

Saurav Shrestha graduated from Minnesota State University in 2010 with a Bachelor's 
degree in Information Technology. He is an avid Linux user who's been using Ubuntu for the 
past 4 years, and The Gimp, informally, for past two years.

Preface
The GIMP project was started in 1995 by Peter Mattis and Spencer Kimball, and is now 
maintained by a group of volunteers under the auspices of the GNU Project. The first release 
was in January 1996, The latest version of GIMP, version 2.6.1, was released on December 
21, 2010. Available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, GIMP is free 
software; this means that everybody can download and use it.
Besides being free, GIMP is a high-end image editor for photo retouching, image creation 
and editing. Through the years, a huge user community has grown around the GIMP; 
hobbyists, professional illustrators, filmmakers, and photographers use it daily in their 
work. This user base not only use it but also contributes to expand and improve GIMP 
through plugins and scripts.
This book is a collection of tasks that will allow you to learn how to use GIMP from a basic to 
an advanced level. Also, you can experiment while you learn, and enjoy it. I will repeat this 
throughout the book. It's important that you don't stick to the tasks exactly. If your objective is 
to work as a professional, only through experimentation will you acquire your own technique 
and style. Drawing, painting, and designing should not be a mechanical thing, even if you took 
the job just because you needed the money!
Enjoy the book.

Introduction
This chapter is about drawing and painting with GIMP; two of the most basic and fun steps in 
illustration. (you should have fun if you want to work as an artist!) 
We are going to start with the basic tools, and then increase the number of elements and 
their complexity to get to the final piece.
Creating an orb using different paint tools
So, what's an orb? Basically, it's a sphere that we're going to paint and make it look like a 
glossy surface. It's a good introduction to a series of GIMP tools, how to paint and draw, and 
also to the kind of images you're likely to use on a typical business web page. 

Using Draw and Paint Tools
6
Don't try to replicate what you see here, experiment while you learn from 
these examples. See how changing values, sizes, colors, and other attributes 
makes that piece you are creating your own. Create your style while learning 
how to do things.
How to do it...
An orb can be created by following these steps. We'll also give it a glossy surface and the 
shading that goes with it:
1.	 Create a new file, select the Ellipse Select Tool (this can alternatively be done by 
pressing E), and create a perfect circle. Press Shift while dragging or use the tool 
options to make it perfectly round (enable the Fixed option to make it perfectly 
round):

Chapter 1
7
2.	 Select the Blend Tool, and in its tool options change the Gradient to FB to BG (RGB), 
pick a foreground and background color, and change it's shape to Radial:
Make sure you have the lightest color as the foreground color and the darkest one 
as the background color. Use the little white arrow icon near the background and 
foreground colors to reverse them if you need.

Using Draw and Paint Tools

3.	 Create a new layer, name it orb1, and apply the gradient by clicking and dragging 
from the center of the circle to its lower right. Once applied it should look like the 
following screenshot (you don't need to position it exactly at the centre point of the 
circle):
4.	 Duplicate the orb layer by right-clicking on the layer orb1 and selecting Duplicate 
Layer (Shift + Ctrl + D). Name it orb2, and set its mode to overlay:

Chapter 1
9
5.	 Create a new layer. As you can see, the circle created in step 1 with the Ellipse Select 
Tool is still there. Select the Blend Tool, change its Gradient to FG to Transparent, 
the Shape to Radial, and for the foreground color, pick a lighter tone based on the 
one at the center of the circle. Apply it from the center to its bottom:

Using Draw and Paint Tools
10
There's more...
Let's create some reflections. In a new layer, create a small circle around the top centre part 
of the sphere, select the Bucket Fill Tool (Shift + B), and fill it with a white color. Change its 
opacity to something around 10:
Right-click the orb2 layer and from the dropbox select alpha to selection. Create a new layer, 
and drag it to the top of the layer list so we can create a reflection on top of the sphere. Now 
select the Ellipse Select Tool, and set it to subtract mode:
Draw a big ellipse around the sphere leaving only a small part at the bottom, as shown here:

Chapter 1
11
Then, in a new layer fill, this selection with white, and change its opacity to something around 5:

Using Draw and Paint Tools
12
Now, with the Ellipse Select Tool, in a new layer, draw another small circle around the top 
right side of the sphere, smaller than the previous one. Then set the tool options to subtract, 
and deselect the bottom part of the small ellipse you just created (just draw another ellipse 
near the bottom part with the subtract mode selected). Then, fill it with white color:
Then, move and rotate the selection, combining the Move Tool (M) and the Rotate Tool 
(Shift + R) until it looks as follows:

Chapter 1
13
You can also use the Zoom Tool (Z) to zoom in and out of the file if you want to work with more 
accuracy.
Now, select the Paths Tool (B) and draw a small figure, as shown in the following screenshot, 
to give the impression of a reflection. Then, click on the Selection from Path button inside the 
tool options of the Paths Tool. You can also use the Enter key to complete a path selection:

Using Draw and Paint Tools
14
Then, you can press Delete to erase the selection and change the layer's opacity to 
something around 7.
We're done now; your orb should look like the following:

Blending colors
There are many techniques on how to blend and mix colors, both on the digital and the 
analogue world of paper and pencil. Here, I present to you a quick way to blend any 
combination of colors; of course, you will need some practice to master it, but following it 
you'll also take command of a few more tools of GIMP.
How to do it...
To blend two distinct colors carry out the following steps:
1.	 Create a new file, pick two colors you like and paint them one besides the other with 
a thick brush.
2.	 Pick a thick brush, change its opacity to around 30, and start painting with short 
crossed strokes over the opposite color you have selected. This is a process so 
don't expect it to happen magically, just keep trying.

Using Draw and Paint Tools
16
This is how my picture looks after the first pass:
3.	 Reduce the size of the brush, and pick the lightest color (use the Color Picker on the 
section you just painted over); in my case, I picked a red. Use the Color Picker Tool 
(or hold down Ctrl and left-click while using the brush). Using the same technique, 
paint over the other color. In my case, I painted over the green patch on the right:

Chapter 1
17
Now you just repeat the process, pick the lightest color, correct brush opacity and 
size, and paint it with short strokes over the opposite color. As I said, you need to 
practice; most of the time, you will not end with the kind of color blending you want or 
imagine, but after a while you'll master the tools and know what sizes and opacities 
work to get the best results.
4.	 After repeating the process a couple of times, if you need to, you can smooth 
everything with the Smudge Tool:

Using Draw and Paint Tools
18
Vary the brush type (a fuzzy brush works best), size, and opacity, and smudge the 
colors until you are satisfied with the way colors intersect and blend. The result 
should look something like the following:
How to paint a sky and clouds
Painting the sky is a great way to apply several techniques and continue mastering GIMP 
tools. If you can paint while actually watching the sky, you will develop the speed and ability 
to create and not only copy, something that is essential to any artist looking for his/her own 
style.
 

Chapter 1
19
How to do it...
Follow these simple steps to create a beautiful skyscape:
1.	 For this recipe, always work on the same layer. First, fill the canvas with a sky-blue 
color of your choice using the Bucket Fill Tool:
2.	 Now, use the Dodge Tool to create variations on the sky. This is the base of the clouds. 
If you look at the real sky, you'll notice that it tends to get brighter on the horizon.

Using Draw and Paint Tools
20
3.	 Quickly blend it with the Smudge Tool, and pay attention to the brush size, opacity, 
and rate. This gives different looks to each sky; makes it brighter, darker, rainy, snowy, 
and so on.
4.	 Now again select the Dodge Tool with a smaller brush, and paint a rough form of the 
cloud you want:

Chapter 1
21
This needs to be done in a one-click motion, without lifting your finger off the mouse 
button. So, hold it while creating the entire cloud (outline and filling). If you let go of 
the mouse-button, the dodge tool will make your previous dodge look even lighter. 
This doesn't count as a mistake, but be aware that this can happen.
5.	 Now, Smudge it to give it a more fluffy appearance, try first with a wider Scale:

Using Draw and Paint Tools
22
As you can see, this is starting to look like a real cloud! Now, repeat the operation a 
few more times until you are satisfied with your work:
6.	 Use smaller brushes each time you use the Dodge tool

Chapter 1
23
Smudge only the area where you applied the last dodge:
7.	
Now, you can start painting highlights. Just repeat the operation with smaller 
brushes, and paint only where you want the cloud to have more volume and 
brightness. Don't use thick brushes.

Using Draw and Paint Tools
24
8.	 As before, now apply Smudge again. See how using a fuzzy or a solid brush 
completely changes how the cloud looks:
The cloud is starting to get some realistic volume now:
9.	 Repeat the previous two steps a few more times until you are satisfied with the result.

From sketch to finished piece: creating 
a cartoon of yourself
The design of a person's cartoon is based on his/her physical characteristics. This doesn't 
mean you should draw exaggerated features, or at least, not always. From my point of view, to 
draw a cartoon of any real person, I consider not only his/her characteristics, but also knowing 
him as a person. Chat for at least a couple of minutes, know their tone of voice, their body 
language, and then, just then, put everything into consideration, and start sketching, even 
while talking. Also, you should be careful what you exaggerate, some people may get angry or 
sad if you make a nose bigger or smaller, a chest or a belly too big or too small.
As I have said previously, don't try to copy what you see here, my goal is to show you how to 
create a cartoon using a computer program—GIMP, in this case. So, experiment, and if you get 
frustrated, just get a cup of tea, come back in ten minutes and continue practising until you 
are happy with what you see.

Using Draw and Paint Tools
26
How to do it...
Sometimes, inspiration or ideas don't come easy. Sometimes, you keep looking at your model 
or landscape and you can't start working on that white page that is starting to look bigger and 
bigger. Sketching, scribbling and doodling are the most natural ways for me to start working 
when I have a shortage of ideas. Just grab a pen, a pencil, anything, and a piece of paper, 
and start moving your hand. It won't be long (usually!) until you find shapes and textures that 
give you that wonderful idea. That's why most of the time I start my illustrations on a piece of 
paper. Of course you could also sketch, scribble, or doodle in a computer screen and GIMP!
1.	 Firstly, create a new layer, and start with a nice brush. Use the Eraser Tool or change 
the layer's Opacity and paint in a new one while cleaning it until you get to the base 
of your cartoon. For this chapter, I've created the outlines of my cartoon on paper with 
a 2B pencil, and then scanned the cartoon into GIMP:

Chapter 1
27
2.	 As you can see, the outlines are not clean, many lines don't look good, other shouldn't 
be there, and sometimes you just want to redo them. This is an important step when 
creating any illustration. Here you clean the outlines to give the base of the image 
a professional look. However, remember, this is not a step-by-step process. You can 
always go back to clean (or rough it up!) at any point if you feel like it.
Currently the image looks like this:

Using Draw and Paint Tools
28
3.	 Use the Eraser Tool and the Brush Tool with a brush the same color as your 
background to remove the lines you don't want. The resultant image will have 
a cleaner look, like the following:

Chapter 1
29
The Zoom Tool (+ and - on the Number Pad) is essential for this part. Use it to 
get a more detailed view of the outlines and to erase exactly what you want.
Always have in mind the final media where your illustration is going to be 
shown. Sometimes, I find myself obsessively trying to change something that 
nobody is going to see. I mean, that's fine if you want to hide things or just 
create something perfect, even if you are the only one that will notice it, but if 
you are on a tight schedule and just need to finish a piece of work, don't get 
obsessed when you are working with the zoom.
4.	 This is how my cleaned image looks:

Using Draw and Paint Tools
30
To give your picture a more standard, professional look, you should trace the 
pencil outlines (or even your digital sketch) and give it a smoother look. Lines 
should flow, giving the impression the outlines are made in a single try, with 
no rough edges and unions. 
As I said, what we have seen is just a standard. In my opinion, you should look for your own 
style, and try to use it with your clients. I mean, most of the time I draw my own outlines on 
paper, or just trace them with a modulated brush (you'll need a tablet for that) after cleaning 
the sketch. However, this is not the case many times, so here, I'm giving you the steps to 
create clean outlines:
1.	 Select the Path Tool and start tracing your sketch. You can begin where you want. 
I usually start with the outer lines, and use the Zoom Tool to trace it more accurately. 
However, remember, don't get obsessed! You still are a long way off from the final 
piece!

Chapter 1
31
2.	 Continue tracing the outer lines, and don't get messed up if you don't know where 
to continue when you reach an intersection, just work on the outer lines. There's no 
need to close the path for what we are doing now, so if you get stuck, just stop and 
create the stroke for the selected path, and then continue tracing.

Using Draw and Paint Tools

Chapter 1
33
In my case, I completed all the exterior outlines before creating the strokes. You may 
do this at any time.
3.	 Continue tracing with the Path Tool, creating a stroke, and so on, until you cover all the 
sketch lines. To create the strokes, first create a new layer and name it outline, then 
click on the Stroke Path button inside the Path Tool options toolbox. A new window will 
pop up, where you can choose from several different ways of creating the stroke:
Basically, it can be a Stroke line or a Stroke Line with a paint tool. Now you make a 
decision, or better, try different settings, until you find one that works best for you and 
how you want the final piece to look.
Applying a stroke line with the Stroke line option produces lines with harder vertices. 
However, if you use the Stroke with a paint tool option, it gives you a little more 
control over the way lines behave. Select the paintbrush as the paint tool for the 
stroke and configure a brush with its own options to get your outline drew exactly 
as if you have done it yourself with a steady hand. You can even enable the brush 
dynamics option, which will create the stroke simulating pressure and any other 
options you have enabled in your brush tool settings.
Applying strokes to a path with different settings gives different looks:

4.	 Continue creating the remaining strokes. Sometimes, the inner details of your 
characters look better with thinner lines than the ones on the outside. Experiment 
with different values. In my image, I used different settings for the lines around the 
eyes, the mouth, and the background.

Chapter 1
35
This is how my outlines look after I have finished tracing everything:

Using Draw and Paint Tools
36
Let's start painting:
1.	 First, create a new layer, and name it background color. Place it below the 
outline layer:
As you can see, I've also created a couple more layers to help me when cleaning and 
adjusting the sketch.
2.	 Now, pick a color for the sky and a brush, and paint it. Fill it with some clouds using the 
technique we learned in the previous recipe. There's no need to avoid painting inside 
the character because we are going to create a layer to paint over the background:

Chapter 1
37
3.	 When you are done, create another layer, and name it background bottom. Place it 
below the background color layer, and paint it with a nice green. If you go over the 
lines just use the Eraser Tool to adjust the limits, use the Zoom Tool to work with 
greater accuracy.
 

Using Draw and Paint Tools
38
4.	 Now, go back to the background color layer, adjust your brush, and paint the little 
tree on the right. Using the Fuzzy Select Tool, left-click on the tree color to select it. 
This is a quick way to paint inside a specific part of the drawing without touching the 
surrounding colors. If what you need to paint is complex, you could also create a new 
layer and paint on it to avoid painting over an area that you think is already finished. 
This is not the case; you are just painting a small part of the tree with a lighter green. 
Use a small brush to paint it. If you want to practice, try to blend these two colors. 
This is the tree without blending it's colors:

Chapter 1
39
For this example, I choose to leave the two colors separated:
5.	 Now, you just have to apply the same process we did for the background to the 
character. Create a few more new layers like hair, skin, clothes and go for it!

Using Draw and Paint Tools
40
6.	 You have enough information now to experiment with colors, brush sizes, dodge, and 
burn, so go paint your character, and come back when you are finished. Here is my 
painted illustration, just in case you need some inspiration:
You could also add a few shadows, I added a small one for the 
tree in the background. For the skin and clothes use the same 
technique as with the tree.

Chapter 1
41
7.	
 Use the Fuzzy Select Tool to select the color (if the color is not contiguous you can 
always add to the existing selection, pressing Shift or changing the tool mode in it's 
options box). Then, pick a lighter or darker tone for the color you want to add to the 
shadow or the highlight, and paint it in the same layer (or create a new one if you 
really want to keep things ordered).
Be careful with shadows. Try to make them consistent with the light source, or if you don't 
want to do that, make them very inconsistent, so as to not give a chance to the observer to 
think that you made a mistake while drawing. In my case, light should come from the back of 
the character, but I always prefer to introduce a little confusion and paint shadows that give 
the character a stranger appearance.

Using Draw and Paint Tools
42
You can consider your picture finished, but you can always experiment a little more! In my 
case, I like to play with textures, I'm always putting strange things in my scanner to create 
weird textures that give any illustration the strange, worn out, vintage, retro, grunge style 
that I like!
1.	 So to really finish my illustration I picked a royalty-free texture from the Internet and 
pasted it into the image:
2.	 I know, that doesn't look good, but wait. Use any of the transform tools (Move, 
Rotate, Scale, and so on) to change the texture shape and cover everything: 
Basically, select the Scale tool and click on the texture. Then, drag the corners of the 
texture image until it completely covers the canvas. Use the Ctrl key if you want to 
keep the texture's proportions). Then right-click the texture's layer and choose New 
Layer to convert it to a normal layer:

Chapter 1

3.	 Now, change its mode to Multiply, and change its opacity to a value that works for 
you, and there. The cartoon is complete!

Introduction
In GIMP, filters are a special type of plugins designed to modify an image. Usually, the filter 
works by taking the active layer (or a selection) as input and modifying it with a mathematical 
algorithm. The result is the modified layer, but a few filters have the option of creating a new 
layer with the result.

Image Filters and Effects

Several effects can be applied with the different filters GIMP provides; you can find them in 
the Filters menu, and they are organized in categories:

Alpha to Logo
Each category contains several filters; each one modifies images with different parameters 
and algorithms. Most of the filters have a preview option; which enables you to check the 
effect of the plugin before applying it, and save time. Anyway, remember that you always have 
the Undo (Ctrl + Z) operation to go back in time, and cancel the last operation. All the effects 
and plugins have their own filter window, which can be moved and resized to have a better 
preview of the changes the filter makes on the original image.
This chapter's goal is not to teach you how to use every filter and all of their options—this is not 
a reference manual. I'll show you a few of the most useful filters for illustrators and designers 
that can save you time and effort in completing your work. As I've told you many times now: 
experiment, try different things and learn when things don't end looking the way you wanted.
I'll be using the same picture most of the time; so you can compare results when applying 
filters of the same kind—say hello to Ron and Leeloo:

Chapter 2
47
Using Blur
Blur filters apply a blur to the active layer of an image or to a selection, if one is created. 
There are six different blur filters in GIMP 2.6, each one with its own options.
How to do it...
The basic steps for applying any blur filter are the same:
1.	 Open any existing image.
2.	 If you want to apply the effect to an area of the image use any of the 
Selection Tools (Optional).
3.	 Choose any of the Blur filters, modify parameters, and apply.
The basic Blur effect (Filters | Blur | Blur) is a quick-with-no-options blur. It automatically 
adds a simple blur that softens the image. The Gaussian Blur (Filters | Blur | Gaussian 
Blur) offers more control. With it you can choose the blur radius (this means the amount of 
blur) for each coordinate, along with the method by which it is generated; IIR works best for 
large blur radius and images which are not computer generated, and RLE works best with 
computer-generated pictures with large areas of the same color.

Image Filters and Effects
48
The following is the Gaussian Blur configuration window, where you can control the amount of 
blur on each coordinate:
After applying Gaussian Blur, our image will look like the following:

Chapter 2
49
There's also the option of using Selective Gaussian Blur (Filters | Blur | Selective Gaussian 
Blur), where blur is applied if the pixel's value is less than the value in the Delta field of the 
options, and you can use it to give your pictures some sort of depth.
The following is the Selective Gaussian Blur configuration window:
If the color value of the pixel is above the value set in the Delta field, the blur 
is not applied to that pixel.

Image Filters and Effects
50
On applying Selective Gaussian Blur, our image will look like the following:
Motion Blur simulates the blur generated by movement. You can set it to Linear, Radial, or 
Zoom along with its length and angle. The Blur Center option is where the blur starts (Radial 
Blur). You can't set it in the preview window.

Chapter 2
51
The following is the Motion Blur configuration window:
Applying Motion Blur would make our image look like the following:

Image Filters and Effects
52
Pixelize works more as a distortion filter but it generates an effect that I really like. You set 
how big you want your pixels and it sets them in color blocks:
The following is the Pixelize configuration window:

Chapter 2
53
Applying Pixelize produces the following result:
Using Distorts
Distort filters modify your image or selection in many different ways.

Image Filters and Effects
54
How to do it...
The basic steps for applying any distortion filter are the same:
1.	 Open any existing image.
2.	 If you want to apply the effect to a specific area use the Selection Tool (Optional).
3.	 Choose any of the Distort filters, modify parameters, and apply.
Curve Bend is a quick way to alter an image or selection in no time, and get good results. 
The result is applied from one border to the other.
The following is the Curve Bend configuration window:
The quickest way to use it is to click and drag inside the Modify Curves grid after enabling 
the Automatic preview option. However, be careful, if you have a slow computer or create 
complex curves, the preview can take more than just a few seconds to complete.

Chapter 2
55
Applying the following curve should produce an image like the following:
The Emboss filter converts bright areas of your image or selection to bumps, and dark areas 
to hollow points, giving it the impression of being carved or stamped.

Image Filters and Effects
56
In the Emboss configuration window you can control different values. Azimuth sets the angle 
of the light counter-clockwise, Elevation sets the height of the light in degrees (from 0 to 180), 
and Depth sets the distance of the light source:
Keep in mind this filter only works with images in RGB mode. You can change its mode using 
the Image | Mode menu option.

Chapter 2
57
Applying Emboss with the shown values will produce the following result:
There are a few filters that need an alpha channel to work. This is the case of the Engrave 
filter, which converts the image to black and white with horizontal lines that change height, 
depending on the value of the pixels below it. To add an alpha channel to an image, go to 
Layer | Transparency | Add Alpha Channel. Then, you can apply the filter as always.
 

Image Filters and Effects
58
The Engrave configuration window looks like the following:
Each pixel contains not only information about its own color, but also about 
its transparency level. When two pixels are overlaid one on top of the other, 
the transparency data is used to know how the pixels should be colored. This 
transparency information is called the Alpha Channel. Usually you don't 
define the alpha channel on a pixel-by-pixel basis, but on the overall image/
selection to set different transparent areas.

Chapter 2
59
On applying Engrave with the shown values, we get the following resultant image:
The IWarp filter works as an advanced Curve Bend; it allows you to interactively deform your 
image. It has an animation option that quickly allows you to create an animation that fades 
the deformation in and out.

Image Filters and Effects
60
The following is the IWarp configuration window:
Applying IWarp would produce a result similar to the following:

Chapter 2
61
You have now read a little about the Distort filters; these are just a few examples of some of 
them. Go practice and experiment!
The Lens Distortion filter simulates and can correct the distortions introduced by camera 
lenses. We can compensate for the fisheye effect produced by some lenses, or introduce 
our own:

Image Filters and Effects
62
The Mosaic filter creates 3D joined polygons as if the image was a tiled mosaic:
The Newsprint filter creates dots, reducing resolution but increasing the apparent tone depth. 
This is useful when printing with a device with not many tones; but hey, it also creates a nice 
effect:

Chapter 2
63
The Ripple filter creates waves, as if the image was a reflection on moving water:

Image Filters and Effects
64
The Video filter simulates the scan lines of a video file:
The Waves filter creates radial waves around the center of the image or selection simulating 
the effect of ripples in a pool of water:

Chapter 2
65
The Whirl and Pinch filter distorts the image in a spiral (whirl) and as if it was pinched toward 
or from the screen (pinch):
The Wind filter detects edges and adds black or white lines from them. This can be another 
way to give the illusion of movement:

Image Filters and Effects
66
Using Light and Shadow
These filters are separated in three main groups; the first group is for creating illumination 
effects, the second holds scripts to render shadows, and the third is used to make the image 
look as if seen through a lens or a glass tile.
How to do it...
The basic steps for applying any Light and Shadow filters are the same:
1.	 Open any existing image.
2.	 If you want to apply the effect to an area of it, use any Selection Tool (Optional).
3.	 Choose any of the Light and Shadow filters, modify parameters, and apply.
The Gradient Flare filter has lots of options. It consists of three separate pieces: the center 
glow, rays, and flares. Each one has its own properties and options:
The Gradient Flare configuration window looks like the following:
By clicking Edit inside the Selector tab, we can edit all the settings on how each component 
of the flare behaves: the glow, the rays, and any other secondary flare we want to include. 
Most of the presets work very well if you are short of time and want quick results, but you 
should at least play a little with the sliders just to get a custom result a little more coherent 
with the original image. Work with the colors, the real light sources, take a photo pointing your 
camera to a light source, see how real flares are created, and work from there!

Chapter 2
67
After applying Gradient Flare our image looks like the following:
The Drop Shadow filter is a quick way to make a layer or selection cast a shadow over a 
background. This is useful for web developers and designers when creating backgrounds 
or borders.
The following is the Drop Shadow configuration window:

Image Filters and Effects
68
With this filter, you can give your image a simple 3D look. If the Allow resizing option is 
enabled, the image is automatically scaled to show the shadow. You can also control its 
position, color, and size:
Using Noise
These are some of my favorite filters. I already told you that I like textures and dirt. Most of the 
time, I work with my own scanned textures, or paint the dust and scratches, but by working a 
little with the different options, there's always some time to save. Some of these filters apply 
random noise to the image or selection (like Hurl or RGB Noise), while others have more 
selective algorithms which allow you to not only give texture to your image but also give it an 
impressionistic look while still keeping its colors and forms (like Pick, Slur, or Spread).

Chapter 2
69
How to do it...
Adding Noise can be done by following these simple steps:
1.	 Open any existing image.
2.	 If you want to apply the effect to an area of it use the Selection Tool (Optional).
3.	 Choose any of the Noise filters, modify parameters, and apply.
The RGB Noise filter adds noise to a layer or selection based on the modification of each color 
channel of every pixel. It doesn't work on images in indexed mode.
The following is the RGB Noise configuration window:

Image Filters and Effects
70
Applying RGB Noise would produce an image like the following:
Pick interchanges surrounding pixels on the active layer or selection randomly. Visually, it 
looks like smudging your picture with a small, thick brush; so have this filter in mind for the 
time you need something like this quick!
The following is the Pick configuration window:

Chapter 2
71
On applying Pick the image looks like the following:

Image Filters and Effects
72
Using Edge-Detect
Edge-Detect filters not only do what they imply; as the Noise filters of the previous pages they 
provide very interesting effects that can really make your images stand out.
How to do it...
You can add Edge-Detect filters by carrying the following steps:
1.	 Open any existing image.
2.	 If you want to apply the effect to an area of it, use the Selection Tool (Optional).
3.	 Choose any of the Edge-Detect filters, modify parameters, and apply.
Edge and Sobel can really turn your image into a weird sort-of retro-psychedelic piece. Just 
try the different options, and play a little with the settings. After applying the Edge filter, our 
image looks like the following:

Chapter 2
73
The Neon filter detects contours and applies a neon effect to them:
Using Artistic
These filters render several traditional artistic effects, simulating paint, canvas, and 
other media.
How to do it...
You can apply Artistic filters to your image by carrying out the following steps:
1.	 Open any existing image.
2.	 If you want to apply the effect to an area of it, use the Selection Tool (Optional).
 

Image Filters and Effects
74
3.	 Choose any of the Artistic filters, modify parameters, and apply.
The Canvas filter renders a simulated canvas over the image, giving it a textured look as if the 
image was printed or painted (that depends on the actual picture!) on a canvas. The following 
is the Canvas configuration window:
Canvas would produce the following result:

Chapter 2
75
You can also completely change the way your image looks with a filter like Cubism. 
This is what the Cubism configuration window looks like:

Image Filters and Effects
76
Applying these settings would produce the following result:
There's more
However, Cubism is only the starting point. You should definitely check the GIMPresionist 
plugin, which provides many more options, combining the Canvas and Cubism filters with 
brush and color selections, brush stroke orientation, and distribution. It's a really powerful 
plugin that enables the user to customize fully how the artistic plugins work.
Using Decor
Decor filters render borders to selections or layers.
How to do it...
You can apply a Decor filter by following these steps:
1.	 Open any existing image.
2.	 If you want to apply the effect to an area of it use the Selection Tool (Optional).
3.	 Choose any of the light and shadow filters, modify parameters, and apply.

Chapter 2
77
There are three filters in this category that can make your web design job a little quicker. The 
Add Bevel filter adds a slight bevel to the image or selection:
The result of beveling a section can be seen in the following image: 

Image Filters and Effects
78
The Add Border filter adds a colored border to the image or selection:
The shown values would produce a border similar to the following:

Chapter 2
79
The Round Corner filter turns corners of your image into smooth curves:
With these values, we would get the following resultant image:

Image Filters and Effects
80
Be aware of the fact that if you are working on a website design, and you need 
rounded corners, you should have a transparent background, and save the 
image as PNG or GIF. JPG files do not support transparency.
Using Map
Map filters are used to create 3D effects in your image by mapping it into an object. This 
object can be a previously embossed image, a sphere, the same image, a curve, and so on.
How to do it...
To map an image to an object carry out the following steps:
1.	 Open any existing image.
2.	 If you want to apply the effect to an area of it, use the Selection Tool (Optional).
3.	 Choose any of the Map filters, modify parameters, and apply.
The Bump filter maps your image into another. You need to open a second image file first 
before trying to apply the filter. The following is the Bump configuration window:

Chapter 2
81
Using the same image as the map will give you an image with sharper embossed edges. Here 
is an example:
Fractals are fun and a quick way to distort your image completely. You can use its elements 
and composition to form very interesting mathematical shapes. The Fractal Trace filter is 
shown in the following image:

Image Filters and Effects
82
This would produce the following resultant image:
Using Render
The Render filters work differently from the other filters in GIMP. They don't usually modify the 
content of an image. They create a particular effect from scratch, sometimes overwriting the 
active layer. It's always a good idea to duplicate your active layer, or create a new one, when 
you work with these filters.
How to do it...
New layers can be rendered by carrying out the following steps:
1.	 Open any existing image.
2.	 If you want to apply the effect to a specific area, use the Selection Tool (Optional).
3.	 Choose any of the Render filters, modify parameters, and apply.

Chapter 2
83
The Difference Clouds (Filters | Render | Clouds | Difference Clouds) filter renders colors 
in cloud-like areas. It renders them in a new layer, which is then set to difference mode, so the 
original layer is not modified. It produces an image similar to the following:
Plasma renders random saturated colors in the active layer. The following is the Plasma 
configuration window:

Image Filters and Effects
84
After applying Plasma, we get the following image, which is actually not much to see:
You can get nice results with it if you duplicate your original layer. Apply the filter (try different 
settings!), put the generated layer on top, and set its mode to overlay:

Chapter 2
85
At first, the Solid Noise filter doesn't look very useful, it renders grey smoky clouds which 
look pretty lame, but remember the Bump map filter? Solid Noise is a good way to generate 
random textures to apply them as maps. Play a little with this filter, and use it as input for 
the Bump and Warp plugins. They can give you very interesting effects. These are the render 
settings for Solid Noise:

Image Filters and Effects
86
This is how it looks when the generated Solid Noise is used as input for the Bump and Warp 
filters in the Map category:

Bump would produce an image like the following:
f

Whereas Warp would produce the following image:

87
IFS stands for Iterated Function System (Filters | Render | Nature | IFS Fractal). It is a very 
powerful fractal generator that can create very cool organic shapes. The changes you make 
with the mouse in the little box on the left of the options window need to be small and precise:
Moving anything way too much or too little can turn the output into a shapeless spot or a 
not-too-organic shape. It's another fun part of GIMP. You MUST experiment with this filter, 
and in no time you will be creating fun, organic shapes.

Image Filters and Effects
88
CML Explorer (Filters | Render | Pattern | CML Explorer) is one of the most complex filters 
in GIMP. It can create incredible textures, but you sure will need more than a few minutes 
to experiment with its options and parameters. You can set the options for each of the Hue, 
Saturation, and Value along with several other advanced parameters. The New Seed, Fix 
Seed, and Random Seed buttons are very important, as they change the way random values 
are generated. You can set any value in the options on the right and completely change your 
texture just by clicking on these buttons. The following is an example of such a rendered 
image:
Jigsaw (Filters | Render | Pattern | Jigsaw) is a fun filter which you can use to turn your 
image in a puzzle quickly. Maybe you can print and spend some time with your kids cutting 
and rebuilding a nice family photo!

The following is the Jigsaw configuration window:
Our puzzled image will look like the following:

Using web design-oriented filters
These three filters are oriented to help you use your images in web pages.
How to do it...
Web filters can be applied by following these steps:
1.	 Open any existing image.
2.	 If you want to apply the effect to an area of it, use the Selection Tool (Optional).
3.	 Choose any of the Web filters, modify parameters, and apply.
Image Map takes a layer as input and allows you to quickly divide an image and define areas 
where the user can click and go to different links, execute JavaScript functions, and so on. 
Nowadays, image maps are not used very much because of Flash and JavaScript development, 
but they can be a useful and quick way to get a nice-looking page. It's a complex filter, but 
basically, once you select the filter from the menu, you will switch to a window like the following:
Use the Define Rectangle Area to draw a rectangle around the area you want to define as 
clickable:

Chapter 2
91
Once you have that area defined, a new option window appears, where you can configure the 
link you want the browser to go to when the user clicks on it. There are several other options 
you can experiment with, but this is the basic function of this filter:
After creating all the areas you need, you can use the Save button to create your image 
map definition:

92
The Semi-Flatten filter is a simple handy tool used to improve images with semi-transparent 
levels. I'll use the orb created in one of the previous chapters to show you how this filter works:
If you apply the filter at this zoom level, maybe you won't notice any change, but let's zoom in 
before applying it:

Chapter 2
93
First you need to set your background color, the same one you will be using on your web page. 
This filter uses that value to change semi-transparent image edges from one color to the 
background smoothly:
The first image shows the transparent pixels on the edge of the orb. After applying the filter 
you can see that the semi-transparent pixels are filled with the selected background color (in 
this case black) in a smooth way.

Image Filters and Effects
94
Slice is more for helping you create a tiled table of your image for use in a HTML file. You set 
horizontal and vertical guides, which then are used to split your image into a subset of files, 
as shown in the following image:
It also creates the HTML file to correctly show them and make it look like the original picture. It 
uses the HTML <table> tag, which is a little outdated now in the web 2.0 world of CSS styles 
and JavaScript, but is a quick way of showing a big image that can take a lot of time to load.
 

Chapter 2
95
Keep in mind that the final generated HTML that this filter generates is basic. You should 
personalize this final generated HTML before using it in your pages.

Image Filters and Effects
96
Using logo-creation filters
Alpha to Logo filters work with the alpha channel of the active layer to add different special 
effects. Keep in mind that you always need an alpha channel to work with these filters.
How to do it...
Any Alpha to Logo filter can be added by following these steps:
1.	 Open any existing image.
2.	 If you want to apply the effect to an area of it, use the Selection Tool (Optional).
3.	 Choose any of the Alpha to Logo filters, modify parameters, and apply.
The Alien Glow adds a spooky glow around the layer's alpha channel. If you apply it to a 
full layer maybe it doesn't add much to the image, but see what it does after a little layer 
duplication and reordering.
Right-click on the layer's name inside the layers widget, and select Add Alpha Channel. 
Duplicate the layer, and create your selection. Then, apply the filter. 

Chapter 2
97
I know, it doesn't look like much yet, but after a little layer reordering, you'll end up with a 
cool effect:
Place your duplicated selection layer on top and your original background layer over the solid 
black that the filter renders. You should get an effect like the following:

Image Filters and Effects
98
You can explore different variations on this filter and the others in the Alpha to Logo category. 
All of them have different options, but the way you apply them to the full layer or a selection is 
the same. Following are some examples:

The Alien Neon filter adds a glow around the layer's active alpha channel, as shown 
in the following image:

This chapter is about working with text. GIMP uses the fonts installed in the system. Many 
times, they are not enough for even the average user. There are many websites that let you 
download cheap fonts for a low price and also, fortunately, there are hundreds of websites 
with free, open-source fonts for download, a huge community of font-loving enthusiasts that 
have no problem with sharing their creations.
Installing a font to use it with GIMP is a really quick and easy task. Just copy the font files to 
the .fonts folder or to your .gimp-[version]/fonts folder in your home directory. Then, 
restart GIMP.

Once you have your fonts set up, they will be available for you with which to work. GIMP 
comes with a wide variety of filters and effects. We saw a few of them in action in the previous 
chapter. Now, we are going to use some of them with just text layers, to give you a clear idea 
of how to create great looking text starting from a solid-color font.
Creating a quick logo for your company
By using a few filters and just little work, we are going to create a logo for a company in 
no time.
How to do it...
We can go about creating our logo by carrying out the following steps:
1.	 In a new file, using the Text Tool, write the name of the company. Pick a font, its size, 
and place it a little above the middle of the canvas. Lock the layer by selecting it and 
clicking in the Lock checkbox to avoid accidentally making changes to it:
2.	 Create a new gradient by clicking on the + button at the bottom of the Gradients 
dialog. If it is not enabled, call it by using Ctrl + G, or go to Windows | Dockable 
Dialogs | Gradients:

Chapter 3
105
3.	 To pick the colors for the gradient, position the mouse over the the orange bar (blue 
in Windows) and right-click:
Select the Left Endpoint's Color:
And/or the Right Endpoint's Color:

Text and Fonts
106
Here are the colors I have chosen:
4.	 Using the Blend Tool, apply the gradient:

Chapter 3
107
5.	 Right-click inside the text layer name in the Layers dialog, and select the Alpha to 
Selection option:
6.	 Then, go to Select | Grow, and make it bigger by 3 pixels:
7.	
Create a new layer and name it border. Fill it using the Bucket Fill Tool (I used a dark 
color), and place it underneath the text layer (drag and drop the border layer):

Text and Fonts
108
8.	 Duplicate the border layer by clicking on the Duplicate button at the bottom of the 
layers dialog, or going to Layer | Duplicate Layer.
9.	 Repeat this operation with the text layer. Move this last duplicated layer on top of the 
border copy layer.
10.	 Merge these duplicated layers by going to Layer | Merge Down, and change its name 
to reflection:
Choose Select | none from the menu to be sure there's no selection present.
11.	 Using the Move Tool, place the reflection layer below the "text" layer and flip it with 
the Flip Tool.
Use the Move Tool to adjust the position of the flipped text, and separate them 
vertically by just a few pixels.
12.	Right-click in the reflection layer inside the Layers dialog, and select the Add Layer 
Mask option. Choose the Black (Full Transparency) and click Add.

Chapter 3
109
13.	Using the Blend Tool, pick the FG to BG gradient from the Gradients Dialog, and 
apply it from bottom to the top to create a semitransparent reflection of the text:

Text and Fonts
110
14.	 Select the original text layer. Right-click on it in the Layers dialog, and choose 
Alpha to Selection. Then with the Ellipse Select Tool in subtract mode (check 
the following image):
Draw an ellipse, as in the following image:
15.	Create a new layer and name it glass. Then, fill it with a white color using the 
Bucket Fill Tool:
16.	 Change its opacity to something around 30 and you are done! Here's the final logo:

Chapter 3
111
How it works...
Just by using a font you like and a few tools you quickly created a logo. See how we only used 
default paint/blend tools and masks to create it? GIMP has powerful extensions but you can 
also create professional pieces without using complex filters or even using much time.
Creating 3D text
This is a fairly simple recipe where we are going to create 3D text.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create text with a 3D effect:
1.	 In a new file, create your text. Pick a font, color, and size. Select the Perspective Tool, 
and drag the layer's corners to simulate perspective until you are satisfied.

Text and Fonts
112
2.	 Duplicate the text layer, and make the copy invisible.
3.	 With the original text layer selected, go to Filters | Map | Bump Map and experiment 
with the settings. You can see mine in the following image:

Chapter 3
113
Once you click OK, duplicate the layer five or six times. These layers are the basis of 
the 3D text effect.

Text and Fonts
114
4.	 Now select one of the layers, click the Move Tool, and press the down key once:
Select another layer, click the Move Tool again and press the down key twice. Repeat 
this operation on each of the duplicated layers, for each layer press the down key one 
more time than the previous layer. When you are satisfied with the thickness of the 
text, merge all the duplicated layers and your image will be ready:

Creating glowing text effects
This is a simple recipe. We will create glowing text with a subtle outline. I'll be using a gradient 
to fill it and make it a little more psychedelic, but you can pick a solid color if you want, or 
create your own gradient for it. 
How to do it...
You can create glowing text by following these steps:
1.	 Create the text, right-click on its name inside the Layers dialog, and select the Alpha 
to Selection option:
2.	 Delete the text layer, and create a new one. Name it text. Don't erase the selection. 
Now, you can choose to use a solid color or a gradient for the glow effect. I'll pick a 
colorful gradient and apply it from left to right with the Blend Tool:

Text and Fonts
116
3.	 You should still have the selection around the text, create a new layer (name it text2), 
and fill it with a solid white using the Bucket Fill Tool. Now, create another new layer 
(name it text3), and fill it with a solid black.
4.	 Delete the selection by going to Select | None from the menu. Make these two layers 
invisible by clicking on the eye icon to the left of the layer's name in the Layers dialog:
5.	 Select the text layer, and go to Filters | Blur | Gaussian Blur. Set the horizontal and 
vertical value to around 10 or 15 pixels:
 

Chapter 3
117
6.	 Enable and select the text2 layer, and apply the same Gaussian Blur, but with a 
Blur Radius of around 5:
7.	
Just to give the glow effect another twist, select the text3 layer and set it to Overlay 
mode. Be aware that this works best with a dark, colored background. If you have a 
bright or transparent background, the effect won't be so noticeable:

Here's what the final piece looks like:
Creating shining plastic text
In this recipe, we are going to create text and make it look like it is made of a plastic material.
How to do it...
We can create shining plastic text by carrying out the following steps:
1.	 In a new file, create a new layer. Use the Text Tool to create the text you want. 
Pick a bright color, and place the text around the middle of the canvas.
2.	 Select Layer | Merge Down from the menu or by right-clicking on the layer's name in 
the Layers dialog:
Then, choose Alpha to Selection to select everything on the layer that is not 
transparent. Now, click Select | Save to Channel:

Chapter 3
119
3.	 Choose Select | Shrink from the menu and shrink the selection by around 10 pixels. 
Be careful how much you shrink the selection. 10 pixels worked for my example, but 
if you are using a small font size or if the font is too narrow, you will have to use a 
different number; experiment! 
4.	 Create a new layer, and fill it with a solid white using the Bucket Fill Tool:

Text and Fonts
120
5.	 Go to Filters | Blur | Gaussian Blur from the menu, and apply a blur of around 
20 pixels in both directions:

Chapter 3
121
6.	 Open the Channels dialog if it's not visible (Windows | Dockable Dialogs | 
Channels), and select the previously saved channel by clicking on it:
7.	
Apply a Gaussian Blur of around 20 pixels (Filters | Blur | Gaussian Blur). You may 
not see the effect applied if you don't have the channel as visible. Don't worry now 
about that.
8.	 Create a new layer, and fill it with a solid black using the Bucket Fill Tool. Place it on 
top of the other layers, and set its mode to Screen:
9.	 Go to Filters | Light and Shadow | Lighting Effects and create some reflections, 
and play a little with the settings. I used the following:

Text and Fonts
122


A Directional light with a normal intensity. Use the X, Y, and Z direction 
buttons to point the light to the place you want:


The Material tab defines how light is reflected by objects. The small spheres 
show how each option reacts to light from the option's minimum to it's 
maximum values. The Metallic option simulates a metallic object:


The Bump Map tab lets you add relief to an image. Brighter points 
will appear higher than darker points. Everything depends on the light 
positioning.

Chapter 3
123
Play with this filter and the amount of blur applied to the saved channel until you are satisfied 
with the final piece. Following is what my final plastic text image looks like:
Creating gold text
This easy recipe will let you create a gold-like effect for your texts.

Text and Fonts
124
How to do it...
Follow these simple steps to create golden text:
1.	 In a new file, create your text, and fill it with a solid white. With the text layer selected 
and still with the Text Tool, click on the Path from Text in the Text options box:
2.	 Create a new layer, and name it main. Then, go to Select | From Path to load the 
selection into this new layer:
3.	 Use the Blend Tool. Pick or create a gradient that looks like gold. GIMP comes 
with a Golden gradient, but it may be a little too bright. You may modify it to get 
a better effect:

Chapter 3
125
Apply the gradient:
4.	 Duplicate the text layer, and name it outlines. Go to Select | Shrink, and reduce 
the selection by 2 or 3 pixels. Delete the selection with the Delete key or by 
pressing Ctrl + X:

Text and Fonts
126
Go to Colors | Brightness-Contrast, set the Brightness slider all the way to the right, 
and set the layer's mode to Overlay:
6.	 Choose your main text layer from the Layers dialog. Go to Filters | Light and Shadow 
| Drop Shadow, and apply a small shadow:
Try not to make the shadow too strong. It's better if it is barely seen. Following is what 
my final golden image looks like:

127
Creating icy cold text
In a few easy steps, turn any text into a cool looking cold piece.
How to do it...
To give that cool, icy look to your text, follow these steps:
1.	 In a new file, type your text, and pick a font and size. Right-click on the layer's name in 
the Layers dialog, and choose the Alpha to Selection option. Go to Filters | Render 
| Clouds | Plasma, and apply it. You'll get something that looks like the following:

Text and Fonts
128
2.	 Go to Colors | Desaturate to change the layer to black and white values, and 
click OK.
3.	 Now go to Colors | Curves and try different options by clicking directly inside the 
graph. Take the following image as an example:

Chapter 3
129
4.	 Create a new layer, and select Layer | Merge Down from the menu. Choose 
Select | None from the menu.
5.	 Rotate the layer 90 degrees counter-clockwise by going to Layer | Transform | 
Rotate 90° counter-clockwise:

Text and Fonts
130
6.	 Go to Filters | Distort | Wind and click OK. This will add a frosted effect:
7.	
Rotate the layer back to its original position by selecting Layer | Transform | Rotate 
90° clockwise. Ice can be of many colors, pick the one you like by going to Colors | 
Colorize:

Chapter 3
131
Your final image should look something like the following:
Creating fiery text
This intermediate recipe will teach you how to make text appear as if it were on fire, and also 
give you a little more practice with the Smudge Tool.
How to do it...
In order to produce fiery text, follow these steps:
1.	 In a new file, create a new layer, and fill it with a solid black. Pick a font and size, and 
create your text with a white solid fill. Merge down the text layer with the previously 
created one by going to Layer | Merge Down, or by selecting it by right-clicking on the 
layer's name from the Layers dialog.

Text and Fonts
132
2.	 Select the Smudge Tool, pick a soft brush, an try with different settings to smudge 
the letters upwards simulating a burning flame.
I used a soft circular brush, varying the scale to get better results as I was smudging 
the letters.
This is how the first letter looks after a few strokes. Remember to smudge upwards:

Chapter 3
133
3.	 Use the Zoom Tool to work with more detail. Continue using the Smudge Tool to 
change borders of each letter, and turn the solid white into different shades of gray. 
Following is what I ended with after a while:

Text and Fonts
134
4.	 Go to Colors | Color Balance, and apply it three times with these values:


First, adjust the color balance for the Shadows of the image:


Then, adjust the color balance for the Midtones:


Finally, adjust the color balance for the Highlights of the image:

Chapter 3
135
After applying these changes, you will end with something like the following:

Text and Fonts
136
5.	 If you want, you could apply a small Gaussian Blur to it. Go to Filters | Blur | 
Gaussian Blur, and apply it with a value around 3 pixels. Following is my final piece:
Creating paper cutout text
In a few fairly simple steps, make your text look as if it has been cut from a piece of a old 
paper. Also we'll learn how to correct and improvise a little when we are experimenting with 
filters to get the results we want.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to produce a paper cutout text effect:
1.	 Create the text, pick a font and a size. The font's color will be used as the object 
below the paper cutout:

Chapter 3
137
2.	 With the text layer selected, and with the Text Tool, click on the Path from Text 
button at the bottom of the options:
Now, go to Select | From Path and then Select | Invert.
3.	 Create a new layer and name it Drop Shadow. Go to Filters | Light and Shadow | 
Drop Shadow. Set it to a small amount, and also pick a color that is a bit darker 
than the text face to improve the effect of the paper casting a shadow on the 
object behind it:

Text and Fonts
138
Now, sometimes when you are trying new things, they don't go exactly as you 
want. In this case, the filter applied a shadow also to the edges of our layer. 
Following is what it looks like:
Pick the Eraser Tool and erase all the shadows you don't want. This is how it 
looks after erasing everything I don't like:
 

Chapter 3
139
4.	 If you don't already have it, create a new layer, and fill it with a white solid texture. 
Place it below the text layer:
5.	 Now, go to File | Open as Layers, and pick a paper texture. As I told you before, I try 
to create my own texture library by scanning and taking photos of any kind of texture 
around me. You can do that too, or also download any royalty-free texture from the 
Internet.
6.	 Once you load your texture, place it between the text layer and the solid white we just 
created in the previous step. You can adjust levels, change color balance, desaturate, 
and change its mode to Multiply. Experiment with all these until you are satisfied, 
Following is what my final image looks like:
Creating rubber stamp text
This is a quick and easy recipe to create an effect as if your text is made by a rubber stamp.
How to do it...
To create a rubber stamp-like effect carry out the following steps:
1.	 In a new file, create your text, and pick a font, size, and a color.

Text and Fonts
140
2.	 Use the Rectangle Select Tool, check the Rounded Corners option in the tool 
options dock, and draw a rectangle around the text you just created:
3.	 Go to Edit | Stroke Selection, set the Line width to something around 10 pixels, 
and click Stroke:

Chapter 3
141
4.	 Go to Filters | Noise | Slur, and set the Repeat slider to something around 3. 
Apply this filter with the same settings both to the rectangle and to the text layer:
5.	 Finally, use the Rotate Tool to rotate the layers and make it look like real 
stamped text:

Introduction
When working with photos we need to be sure that colors always look the way we want. 
Monitors, LCDs, and laptop screens, all render colors differently, and they don't look the 
same. There's no way you can control how people see their own screen, but you can calibrate 
your own using some kind of color profiling. The problem extends to different devices like 
scanners, printers, and cellphones, among others, because each device has its own color 
characteristics. Also, each device can handle different ranges of color.
To avoid these problems, color profiles were implemented. It's a table that matches a 
specific color of a device to a device-independent color. Color profiles are created by each 
manufacturer, but the ICC (International Color Consortium) created its own standard.

Photo Manipulation  
144
Calibration, image modes, and colour profiles
This is one of the first things to do before working with photos. The Color Management menu 
(Edit | Preferences | Color Management) enables you to load any preset for your monitor. 
The presets can be created using any hardware calibration and measurement tool. For Linux, 
you can use LPROF (http://lprof.sourceforge.net) and ARGYLL (http://www.
argyllcms.com). For more information on color management in Linux, check http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_color_management.
Apart from the color profile in use, you should set up your monitor and video card to render 
colors as close as possible to the standard. For Linux you can use XCALIB (http://xcalib.
sourceforge.net) or DISPWIN (http://www.argyllcms.com/doc/dispwin.html)
You can also simulate how an image will look when printed by selecting Print Simulation 
from the Mode of Operation in the Color Management menu.
Scaling an image
Image scaling is one of the easiest tasks, and also one of the most useful. In just a few 
seconds you can reduce an image's size, making e-mail transfers quicker.
How to do it...
To scale an image follow these steps:
1.	 Open a file, go to Image | Scale Image.

Chapter 4
145
2.	 Change the size to whatever you want:
As you change one value, you can see the other changing too. That's to keep the 
original file aspect ratio. If you click on any of the chain icons you can change any 
value independently.
How it works...
Image scaling works by changing the number of pixels of an image. The way pixels are 
created/deleted can be changed by choosing a different interpolation method in the Quality 
section of the Scale Image window. The best (but slowest) method is the Cubic interpolation, 
which calculates the color of each pixel by estimating an average of the eight closest ones. 
On the opposite corner, if you choose None as the interpolation method, each pixel gets its 
own color from its closest neighbor. This is the fastest method, but it also generates unwanted 
aliasing that can give you headaches if you are working with transparencies and high-
contrasts.
The resolution fields are useful when printing the image, they say how many pixels are per 
inch. If your image is too big and the resolution too low, the printed image can look pixelated. 
You can change the print size of an image without changing its resolution or size by going to 
Image | Print Size.

Photo Manipulation  
146
Cropping an image
There's another quick way to rescale your image and select just a section of it. Use the 
Crop Tool.
How to do it...
1.	 Open an image, and select the Crop Tool:
2.	 Quickly click and drag around the area you want. Then, just press Return 
(Enter in Windows), and anything around the selection area will be cropped.

Chapter 4
147
Flipping or rotating an image
Sometimes you scan and old photo or take a picture with the camera tilted. Following is how 
to quickly rotate or flip them:

Photo Manipulation  
148
How to do it...
To rotate or flip an image easily, carry out the following steps:
1.	 Open an image, for example the following:
2.	 Select the Flip Tool from the Toolbox:
Use the left-mouse button along with the Ctrl key to change between horizontal and 
vertical flipping.

Chapter 4
149
3.	 Now, to rotate the image, select the Rotate Tool from the Toolbox:

Photo Manipulation  
150
Click and drag your image to rotate it. Use the Ctrl key to constrain rotation to 15 
degrees steps. Press the Return key when you've finished:
How it works...
Flip and rotate are basic tools. You can use the mouse to perform the operations after 
selecting any of them, but using their respective tool options gives you a lot more control. 
In both cases, you can control what to rotate (a layer, a selection, or a path).

Chapter 4
151
Also, in the Rotate tool, you can change the middle point around which the image rotates. 
This allows you to rotate the image with more freedom. To change it, select the Rotate Tool, 
and click and drag the small circle that appears in the center of the image:
You can also set its coordinates from the Rotate window:
You can also flip and rotate an image by using the menu items in Image | transform.

Photo Manipulation  
152
Improving low-light photos
Sometimes, we take photos too quickly, and they end up being too dark. There are ways to 
correct this problem but keep in mind we are dealing with random pictures. Sometimes, 
we might end up with a grainy photo with washed colors or without contrast. So follow the 
upcoming steps as a guide, and experiment with different settings until you are satisfied. 
Sometimes, you can fix your image by changing just the brightness and contrast, sometimes, 
you have to combine the steps, and sometimes, repeat them.
How to do it...
To improve or brighten low-light images, carry out the following steps (you are free to 
experiment with the values). Open a dull/dark image that requires brightening, for example 
the following:
There are three methods by which we can improve the image:
1.	 Method 1: This is the most basic, quick, and easy way to try to make your low-light 
photo look better.

Chapter 4
153
Go to Colors | Brightness-Contrast, and move the sliders to change the brightness 
and contrast levels for the active layer or selection:
You can also keep your left mouse button clicked and drag horizontally to change 
contrast, and vertically to change brightness. The final image looks like the following:

Photo Manipulation  
154
2.	 Method 2: Changing levels is a bit more complex, but once you know a few things, 
using it is pretty intuitive.
Go to Colors | Levels, and the Adjust Color Levels window appears. By clicking and 
dragging inside each of the three little triangles at the bottom of the Input Levels 
area, you can change the values for dark, middle, and light levels of your layer or 
active selection. These values range from 0 (black) to 255 (white) and allows you to 
change how the image looks depending on how each pixel falls in any of these three 
"categories":
This is how the image looks after applying the changes:

Chapter 4
155
3.	 Method 3: Changing curves instead of levels or brightness-contrast is the best way 
to make your image look better. Since with curves, we have better control over how 
contrast and brightness are distributed by adding as many control points as you want.

Photo Manipulation  
156
Go to Colors | Curves to get to the Adjust Color Curves window:
The vertical gradient represents the image's pixel level you want to set (the output 
tonal scale). The horizontal gradient represents the level of each selected pixel (the 
input tonal scale); both of them ranging from 0(black) to 255(white), shadows to 
highlights.
There are two anchors, each on an extreme of the graph. If you click on them, or 
when you click on the curve (and a new anchor is created) you can move it around 
the axes with the mouse or the up and down arrow keys if you want more precision.
 

Chapter 4
157
This is the image after applying the changes:

Photo Manipulation  
158
As you can see, playing a bit too much with curves can introduce color aberrations, so you 
have to keep experimenting until you get to the colors and definition you want.
Scaling an image without deformation 
(Liquid Rescaling)
Image scaling is easy when you want to just change the size of an image. However, many 
times you want to change size of just a few objects, or adjust the background size. These 
tasks can be painful and time-consuming. However, since a few years ago there have been 
some techniques available that allow the automation of these tasks. There is a plugin that 
implements one of these algorithms (called Seam Carving).
Getting ready
To use this plugin, you will have to install it first. The process is different depending on the 
platform you are working on, but it's pretty straightforward and easy. All the information to 
download and install it is on http://liquidrescale.wikidot.com/. You can confirm it's 
properly installed if you see a Liquid Rescale... option at the bottom of your Layer menu.
How to do it...
Time to have fun with the liquid rescale:
1.	 Open an image you want to rescale. For example, the following:

Chapter 4
159
2.	 Go to Layer | Liquid Rescale...

Photo Manipulation  
160
The plugin can take more than a moment if you are using big images. So, it's 
a good way to start by copying the original file, opening it, and reducing it's 
size. Once you are satisfied with the results, you can open the original and 
apply the plugin with the same settings.
3.	 Now it's fun and test time! Try these options first:
4.	 Click on the New button in the Preserve features section on the right. A new layer 
will be created:
5.	 Now, move the plugin window, don't close it! Go back to the image window and 
combine the Selection Tools, the Path Tool, and the Paintbrush Tool with the 
Paint Tool, and paint over the areas you wish to preserve when scaling:

Chapter 4
161
6.	 Back in the plugin window, click the Refresh button at the bottom to see the 
preservation mask applied. Click on the Output tab, and copy my settings:

Photo Manipulation  
162
7.	
Click OK. You should get the following result:
8.	 Hide the Background LqR seam map layer to check the filter result. Go to 
File | Save or File | Save as..., or any of the save options from the File menu 
to save your changes.
How it works...
What you've just done is to paint around the areas that the plugin preserves when it is 
applied. You are helping it decide what NOT to scale. In this case, I decided to shrink the 
image's width, and by painting the cats in the layer that the plugin creates, I told it to use the 
surrounding pixels to modify the image.
The preservation mask is optional, but when practicing you will realize that many times, 
without it, the plugin can create undesired distortions.
The Background LqR seam map layer created in the example is optional; don't click in the 
Output the seams box in the Output tab of the plugin window. I used it in my example to show 
you how the plugin doesn't cross  the area you marked as preserved unless it is too big, and 
there's nothing else to modify when scaling.

There's more...
This is a very useful and time-saving plugin when you get the hang of it. Check it's page for any 
updates, manual, and tutorials at http://liquidrescale.wikidot.com/.
Creating a diorama effect (simulating 
depth of field)
A diorama is a miniature model; it can be a fictional or a real place. Here, you will learn to 
make your pictures look like small landscapes with tiny little people or objects moving around.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to give your picture a diorama effect:
1.	 Open an image file (a nice wide landscape with people, cars, and so on would be apt). 
For example, the following image:

Photo Manipulation  
164
2.	 Pick a focus point; it should be anything near the ground level. Using the Ellipse 
Select Tool, draw a selection around it. For my example, we choose the people 
around the center of the image enjoying the day, sitting on the grass:
Invert your selection by going to Select | Invert. Now, go to Select | Feather, and enter a 
value between 200 and 400. I made a few tests, and a feather of 300 pixels works for my 
example.

How it works...
As the effect simulates a photo taken of a little model instead of a real life landscape, we 
need to fake the depth of the field of the lens. Depth of field is how far away the eye (or a 
camera lens) can remain in focus. In a small model, the depth of field can be very small; 
that's why we pick a focus point, and start selectively blurring around it, increasing the 
amount of blur for the objects that are further from it.
Coloring also is different for small objects and wide, far-away landscapes. Since small objects 
are usually lit with artificial lights or camera flashes, color can be more vivid or bright, so we 
need to simulate them too.
Creating HDR photos
HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. HDR techniques allow the creation of images with a 
wider range of luminance between the darkest and brightest areas of a single photo. This 
means pictures are a bit surreal and great looking!
How to do it...
For this technique you need to take three photos of the same target, one underexposed, one 
correctly exposed, and one overexposed.
Most modern cameras already come with a setting to do this. Check your 
camera manual for the "multiple exposure button" and the "AEB—Automatic 
Exposure Bracketing" options. If you are not sure how this works, just take 
three pictures:
Normal: Just take the picture!
Underexpose: Use a shorter exposure time or close the aperture.
Overexpose: Use a longer exposure time or open the aperture.
Unless you want to have aberrations or artifacts in the final piece, always use 
a tripod!

1.	 Open your files, go to File | Open as Layer, and select your three photos. Hit Return 
or click the Open button. Your files will be loaded each one into it's own layer:
 
2.	 Reorder the layer with the normal picture at the bottom, the underexposed one in 
the middle and the overexposed picture on top of them. Rename the layers to avoid 
confusion:
3.	 Make the overexposed layer invisible by clicking on its eye icon.

172
4.	 Select and duplicate the underexposed layer, and go to Layer | Duplicate Layer. 
Select the underexposed copy layer, and go to Colors | Desaturate to make it black 
and white. Click OK. 
5.	 If the image is mostly black and white like in my example, go to Colors | Curves and 
drag the diagonal's middle point upwards to get a brighter picture. Now, click OK:

This is essential for the effect to work. Experiment with this setting, and try to make 
things appear if it's too dark

6.	 With the underexposed copy layer still selected, go to Select | All and press 
Ctrl + C, or go to Edit | Copy. Make this layer invisible by clicking the eye next 
to it in the Layers dialog. Click on the underexposed layer to select it. Right-click 
on it, and select Add Layer Mask...:

while all the bright parts are masked. Click the eye button of the underexposed layer 
to see the difference:

Click Add on the window that appears:
12.	With the new mask selected, press Ctrl + V to paste the desaturated layer into the 
mask, and click the anchor button:
You should see now that the brightest areas of the overexposed picture are shown, 
while all the dark parts are masked; through them you can see the dark areas of the 
underexposed and behind it, the normal layer.

Chapter 4
181
Here's the final piece:
How it works...
The idea in HDR photography is to take different shots of the same picture and normally 
expose the different shades, so that shadows, bright areas and normally lit areas appear 
correctly exposed in each shot. What we've done here is to use masks to make specific 
parts of the image transparent to allow the proper part (the well-exposed areas in each 
photo) to be displayed.

Photo Manipulation  
182
The key to the whole process is to take at least three photos, exposed normally, one stop 
underexposed, and one stop overexposed. Use a timer to avoid moving the camera when 
taking the photos. It's not impossible to do this with slightly different angles or compositions, 
but first try to use a tripod.
Creating a black and white postcard 
with a color touch
This is a quick way to create a nice postcard from a picture, turning it to black and white with a 
twist of color in it.
How to do it...
Keeping in mind that we are going to use it as a postcard; take a new picture, or search for 
one that you like. I'll be using the following photograph:

Chapter 4
183
1.	 First, duplicate the layer by going to Layer | Duplicate Layer. Click on the eye icon 
next to the background copy button to make it invisible. Click on the background 
layer to select it.
2.	 The final piece will be grayscale, with a little touch of color. So, first choose the 
object that will remain in color. For my example, I choose the flower. Go to Colors | 
Brightness-Contrast, and adjust the saturation until you are satisfied with the level 
of the object you choose to remain in color. The following are the settings I used:

Photo Manipulation  
184
Following is how the picture looks after applying the effect:
3.	 Re-enable the background copy layer by clicking on the white rectangle next to it:

Chapter 4
185
4.	 Click on the background copy layer to select it. Go to Colors | Desaturate to turn the 
layer to grayscale. Click OK:
If you want, you could adjust levels or curves of the black 
and white layer.

Photo Manipulation  
186
5.	 Right-click on the layer name, and select Add Alpha Channel:
6.	 With the background copy layer still selected, use the Eraser Tool over the areas 
where you want to expose colors:
Use the Zoom Tool along with the brush type and scale slider of the Eraser Tools 
options to work with better accuracy.

Chapter 4
187
If you have solid colors, you can try quickly selecting it with the Fuzzy Select 
Tool use it's threshold slider to also select contiguous colors.
Continue working until you expose all the areas you want.

Photo Manipulation  
188
The Eraser Tool works differently when applied to a layer without an alpha 
channel or with it. If the layer doesn't have an alpha channel, the Eraser Tool 
removes areas of colors and replaces it with the current background color. 
On the other hand, if the layer has an alpha channel, the tool removes areas 
of colors, turning them transparent. This is why we need to add an alpha 
channel to our desaturated layer.
7.	
You could also delete any part you want of the black and white layer, and apply any 
kind of other color-correction technique to the original layer, by going to Colors | 
Hue-Saturation and adjusting the Hue and Lightness sliders to change the color of 
the object completely:

Introduction
GIMP is a powerful tool. This chapter shows just a few of its capabilities in color correction 
and image retouch. From simple tasks such as red eye removal to complex object removal 
and skin corrections, GIMP can be your primary image editing software.
This chapter goes from very basic tasks, such as masking and colorizing a black and white 
picture to removing/adding objects from a photo and correcting little imperfections of the 
skin to make people look better. A digital facelift is always cheaper than the real ones!

Playing With Color and Sharpness

Removing red eyes from a picture
Nowadays, many cameras have a setting to avoid the red-eye from the flash reflection, but 
sometimes they are ineffective. This is one of the simplest tasks you can do using GIMP to 
solve of one of the most annoying effects that happens sometime when we take a picture.
How to do it...
To correct a photograph for the red-eye effect, carry out the following steps:
1.	 Open a photograph with people or animals in it, where one or more subjects have 
red eyes.
2.	 Using any of the selection tools, draw a selection box around the pupil: 

Chapter 5
193
The filter can be applied to a whole layer/image, but it's better to create a 
selection around the area of the pupil. Be careful! If you have people with red 
hair or any significant amount of red inside the selection area, then it might 
be erased. Use the Ellipse Select Tool and enable the Fixed checkbox inside 
the tool options to select the pupil quickly. Always try to select just the pupils 
and nothing else.
3.	 Go to Filters | Enhance | Red Eye Removal. Use the threshold slider to change the 
amount of red that is removed from the selection:
Click OK when you are satisfied. The photograph I worked on finally looked like 
the following:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
194
Coloring black and white pictures
In this simple task, we are going add some color to a black and white picture.
How to do it...
First of all, pick any black and white picture that you like; it should have at least one object in 
it that you want to colorize. Following is my pick: meet Scarlett, the cat!
1.	 Choose any object in the picture that you want to colorize. Use any of the selection 
tools available to accurately select it. In my case, I used the Path Tool to create a 
path around the cat:
 

Chapter 5
195
After a few minutes, this is how my path looks:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
196
2.	 Once the path is complete, click on the Selection from Path button in the Path Tool 
properties widget:
Click the Move Tool to make the path invisible and see the selection applied.
3.	 Now go to Colors | Colorize. The Colorize the Image window appears. The following 
image shows the settings that I used for my picture:

Chapter 5
197
4.	 Go to Select | None, and you are done. Following is what my final image looks like:
How it works...
The colorize tool works as if you put a colored glass over your picture. If the original 
layer/image is colored, it first converts it to grayscale, so the original colors are not retained.
There's more...
When you colorize, don't use my settings. Be aware of your object selection and it's 
surroundings, and don't use a very high value for the Saturation slider if you don't 
want your object to look like a pasted image from another picture. Also, use the 
Lightness slider to give your object more or less light or brightness.
You could also apply Colorize to different objects in the same picture, even colorize 
it completely!

of this task, and completely change how a picture looks.
Removing objects from an image
Sometimes, you take a picture and at first sight it looks awesome, then you notice something 
that you don't like, something that shouldn't be there: a person, a hand, a glass. In this recipe, 
we are going to learn how to remove these unwanted objects.

Playing With Color and Sharpness
198
How to do it
Here is what I will be using for the example; what I want to remove is the white street light in 
front of the plane:
2.	 Select the Clone Tool:
To use this tool, first we have to choose an area to clone. In my example, I am starting 
with the area where the street light meets the sky. Hold down Ctrl, and click some 
place near the street light. The distance between where you set the cloning point and 
the object to be removed should be at least the object's width. You'll understand why 
as soon as you start using the clone tool!

Chapter 5
199
3.	 After you do this, start clicking and dragging (painting) over the object you want 
to remove. While cloning, you'll see that the clone point you placed in the last 
step moves the same way as you do. When you click, everything from the clone 
area is copied.

Playing With Color and Sharpness
200
The Clone Tool can be confusing. If you just left-click, the cloning starts 
from the starting clone point you set. However, if you left-click and drag, the 
starting clone point moves along with your mouse, cloning everything around 
it's original position. When you release the mouse, the starting clone point 
goes back to the place where you positioned it.
Be careful. If you drag the starting clone point over the object you want to 
remove, it will be cloned to the place where your mouse is, as shown in the 
following image:

Chapter 5
201
4.	 For my example, it works better to have the clone point at around the same horizontal 
level, because of how the sky color changes:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
202
You should always readjust your starting clone point position and size, and use the 
zoom tool when you get to areas that are not uniformly colored. In my example, there 
are three tricky areas: the clouds, the plane, and all the objects on the ground. Just 
have patience, and remember that you always can go back and Undo it if you don't 
like what you have done.
5.	 When you don't know what's behind the object you're cloning, use your imagination. 
You can clone other parts (like I did here with the trees) or use a brush to paint 
something new:

Chapter 5
203
6.	 Clouds and those kinds of textures aren't difficult either; start cloning:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
204
7.	
When the object is gone, use the Smudge Tool to make the cloud look real again:

Chapter 5
205
The following is the final image, I also removed a few wires that were around the plane and 
the background:

Check the How to paint a sky and clouds recipe in Chapter 1 if you want to add realistic clouds

Removing backgrounds
In this task we are going to pick an object from a picture and erase its background in a few 
easy steps. This is useful when you want to add something to another photo or just want to 
erase everything but the object in question and have a solid color (or a transparency). There 
are a few different ways to do this. In this task, we are going to use the Quick Mask tool.

Playing With Color and Sharpness
206
How to do it...
Choose a photo, and select one object in it that you want to keep. Following is the picture I will 
be using:
1.	 Select the Lasso Tool. Draw a rough selection around the object. There's no need to 
be accurate at this point.

Chapter 5
207
2.	 Click on the little square button at the left bottom corner of the picture window. This 
activates the Quick Mask tool:
Don't be alarmed! The translucent red is the actual mask. It represents everything 
that is NOT selected:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
208
3.	 Select the Pencil Tool, and use a black color. Use it to paint the background more 
precisely around the object you selected. Remember, you can use the Zoom Tool to 
be even more accurate. Also, try using different pencil sizes to have more control. 
Be patient!

Chapter 5
209
If your object doesn't have well-defined edges, you can try applying a sharpen 
filter, or make a decision on where you want the mask to end.
The following is my picture with the mask finished:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
210
4.	 Again, click the Quick Mask button (Shift + Q) at the lower-left corner of the 
picture window:
5.	 Copy your image (Edit | Copy), and paste it as a new image (Edit | Paste as | New 
Image) to create a new image with just your object and no background.

Creating surreal picture manipulations
In this one, we are going to use another method to change the mood of the picture completely, 
from a saturated normal-looking country picture to a surreal picture, or a weird-looking scene 
from a bad B-movie! Experiment!

Playing With Color and Sharpness
212
How to do it...
Pick a photo, open it in GIMP. I shall be using the following image:
1.	 Duplicate the layer by clicking on the button at the bottom of the layers widget:
2.	 Go to Colors | Desaturate, and click OK on the window that appears to convert the 
active layer to grayscale:

Chapter 5
213
3.	 Rename each layer accordingly, and make the colored one invisible. We are keeping it 
for reference, or in case we don't want to change some colors.

Playing With Color and Sharpness
214
4.	 Let's do a quick sketch on what we are trying to do here first. Create a new layer, and 
set it's mode to Multiply:
5.	 Now, choose the different objects you want to change. Click on the Paintbrush Tool, 
and after selecting the colors you want for each object, quickly paint them on. This is 
just to get an idea of how the final picture will look. Don't pick the final colors yet, just 
play a little and see how the different colors combine. Also, don't paint the sky.

Chapter 5
215
I know, it looks like a mess, but remember, this is a sketch!
6.	 Using any of the selection tools, select the sky. I used a combination of the Select by 
Color Tool and the Free Select Tool and got a selection like the following:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
216
7.	
Go to Layer | Transparency | Add Alpha Channel. Now, go to Edit | Cut to remove 
the original sky:
If there's anything remaining of the original sky, don't worry, we'll deal with it later.
8.	 Now, open another picture; choose one with lots of clouds, maybe of a coming 
storm. Use the selection tools to select the sky, copy, and close it. I'll be using 
the following image:

Chapter 5
217
9.	 Go back to our file, and Edit | Paste the sky on top. Click on the new layer button in 
the layers widget to create a new layer with it:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
218
Pasted Layer is the default name GIMP gives to it after you click the 
new layer button.
10.	 Rename it to sky, and drag it to the bottom of the layers list. Use any of the transform 
tools to place it as you want:
 

Chapter 5
219
11.	 Go to Colors | Color Balance, deselect the Preserve luminosity toggle, and adjust 
the sliders to a combination that you like. Once you like the tones, adjust the sliders 
also for Highlights and Shadows:
12.	Now, duplicate the sky layer by going to Layer | Duplicate layer. Repeat the color 
balance, and now pick completely different colors:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
220
13.	Now click the Eraser Tool, and choose one of the Circle Fuzzy brushes:
14.	 Delete parts of the sky copy layer to uncover the underlying sky. Change the opacity 
of the sky copy layer to make the color change more subtle:

Chapter 5
221
15.	Select an object with any of the selection tools. In my case, I used the Path Tool and 
clicked the Selection from Path button to select the horse:
16.	 Now go to Colors | Color Balance, and pick new colors for your object. Here, 
experiment with settings for Highlights, Shadows, and Midtones. Try to pick 
colors that go along with the ones in the sky.

Playing With Color and Sharpness
222
17.	 To finish the piece, use the Smudge Tool, along with the Blur/Sharpen Tool and 
the Eraser Tool, to blend all the areas that still have hard edges. In my example I 
combined these tools, and used them on the background trees.
Adding graffiti to a photo
This is a fairly simple task. We are going to add a graffiti to a picture and make it look as if it 
were really painted on the wall.

Chapter 5
223
How to do it ...
You should pick a picture with a wall. The effect will be better if the wall is textured. This is a 
photo I took at La Boca, a really nice place in Buenos Aires:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
224
1.	 Choose a place where you want your graffiti to be. The graffiti can be anything you 
want! Let's spread the word about GIMP. Click on the Text Tool and write with any 
font that looks good as graffiti:
2.	 Use the Scale Tool, along with the other transformation tools, to place it exactly 
where you want. Don't worry about the perspective right now.

Chapter 5
225
3.	 With the graffiti layer selected, click the Perspective Tool, and use it to match 
the picture's. You can drag each corner to deform it and simulate the perspective 
according to your point of view.
4.	 Duplicate the graffiti layer (Layer | Duplicate Layer). Place the new layer below the 
original one and name it graffiti bg. Right-click on it, and choose Alpha to Selection. 
Now, go to Select | Grow, enter an amount of around 10 pixels, and click OK.

Playing With Color and Sharpness
226
5.	 Use the Bucket Fill Tool to fill the selection with any light color of your choice:
6.	 Once you are satisfied with the graffiti, use Layer | Merge Down to merge all the 
layers (not the background, just the graffiti!) together:

Chapter 5
227
7.	
Select the graffiti layer, and set its mode to Overlay.
If the graffiti looks too sharp, go to Layer | Duplicate Layer move the 
duplicated one below the original, then go to Filters | Blur | Gaussian 
Blur, and apply some blur to it. Try different values until you are satisfied 
with how it looks.

Playing With Color and Sharpness
228
8.	 I moved the graffiti layer a little lower to show you how to make it look as if it's 
covered by some object.

Chapter 5
229
9.	 Click on the Eraser Tool and delete any part of the graffiti that looks like its being 
covered by another object:

Following is how my the final picture looks:
Cleaning objects
In this task you will learn how to remove stains or replace any part of an object in your picture 
that you don't like, and make it look cleaner, or smoother. This is a complex task. To get good 
results, lots of practice is needed, so don't get frustrated if on the first try you don't get the 
results you want!

Chapter 5
231
How to do it...
Load the picture with the object you want to clean. I'll be using the following image:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
232
I really like this picture from a fountain in Rome, what I don't like is the rusty stain on the 
faun's chin (I think it's a faun). To clean this image, I carried out the following procedure:
1.	 Select the Clone Tool, and pick a starting clone point with a color close to the one 
that should appear in the area you want to clean. Change the starting clone point 
to some place near the clone area as you make it wider. Remember to use different 
brush sizes to make your work easier.
2.	 Use a fuzzy brush, and combine single clicks with a few click-and-drag.

Chapter 5
233
The area looks much better now, but as we cloned a small area and repeated it, the 
texture is not right.

Playing With Color and Sharpness
234
3.	 Watch your picture. Identify areas on it where the texture and color might work in the 
cleaned area. Clone from different areas to improve texture:
Change your clone tool opacity to add more variants to the texture:

Chapter 5
235

Playing With Color and Sharpness
236
4.	 The textures look good now, but the chin looks flat. Use the Dodge/Burn tool to add 
some highlights and shadows to it. Use a fuzzy brush:
Set the Dodge/Burn tool to burn look at the whole picture to see which direction 
light comes from and shade accordingly:
 

Chapter 5
237
5.	 Decrease the Dodge/Burn tool opacity to have more control over the amount of 
shade you add. Also, use different brush sizes, depending on the area you want 
to shade. Following is what my final image looks like:

238
Correcting facial imperfections
In this task, we are going to correct skin imperfections like wrinkles, bags under the eyes, and 
other such facial defects. This is a complex task; to get better results, you need practice and 
patience. These steps can be applied to any kind of picture: from a photo from aunt Millie's 
birthday that you took with a small consumer camera, to expensive studio photography with 
models and special lightning.
How to do it
Open a photo that you like. This is mine:
Actually, that's really me, I want to show you that skin imperfections can be corrected in any 
kind of photo, even in this low quality, badly lit picture! When I took this picture, I just had a 
haircut, so we are going to get rid of those tiny loose hair that are around my forehead.
1.	 Let's work just under the eye on the right side of the picture. Duplicate the layer 
first, just to have the original at hand and compare results when we finish. 

Chapter 5
239
Go to Layer | Duplicate Layer. Now, click on the Healing Tool:
2.	 This tool works in a similar way as the Clone Tool. First, pick a starting clone point 
from an area that has a color tone similar to the one you think should be in the area 
below the eye. Hold Ctrl, and click over the area you selected. Pick a fuzzy brush:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
240
3.	 Now start healing the darkened areas you want to remove; use different brush sizes 
and different starting clone points:
This is not the final step, so take care of the worst areas, and try to make the area 
look uniformly colored:

Chapter 5
241
4.	 Now, create a new layer, and make it transparent. Select the Paintbrush Tool, and 
with a solid white color, paint all over the area on which you have been working:
5.	 Now, apply a Gaussian Blur to this layer, using a Radius of around 75 pixels:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
242
Following is how the solid white layer looks after applying the Gaussian Blur:
6.	 Change the layer's mode to Overlay:

Chapter 5
243
7.	
Duplicate the original background layer, and move the newest copy on top of the 
others. Change its mode to Hue:
8.	 Repeat the last operation, but this time, set the layer's mode to Saturation:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
244
9.	 It's done. If you want, decrease the opacity of the transparent layer (New Layer):
10.	 Save your image using another name. Go to File | Save as:
11.	 Once you saved your file, flatten the image to just one layer by going to Image | 
Flatten Image. Now, you have the same picture, but with only one layer. We can 
start working on the forehead.

Chapter 5
245
12.	Click the Healing Tool again (use a fuzzy brush). Pick a starting clone point near the 
scar, and start cloning:

Playing With Color and Sharpness
246
Be aware of the light source and how it makes the forehead shine. In my case, if 
there was no scar, the forehead would be the brightest area, so change your starting 
clone point accordingly. Be patient, and go slowly. Following is how the forehead looks 
after a few minutes:

Chapter 5
247
13.	Zoom the image to the area you want to clean. Use the Healing Tool again. 
This time, pick a starting clone point for each particle, hair, freckle, and so on, 
that you want to remove.

nowadays, but since the beginning buttons have existed in some form or another. They've 
been evolving and changing from one design paradigm to another. The elements that changed 
through time are more or less the same: size, shape, color, borders, 3D or 2D, and so on. 
In this chapter we are going to create buttons that work with the Web 2.0 model. They have 
some design elements that are essential for it, but remember: there are no obligations on 
how buttons look. You can start from a totally normal Web 2.0 page design and convert it to 
something completely different just by changing a few elements on it.

Blogs are something different. Well, it's not that they didn't exist ten years back, but they 
appeared with the evolution of the different digital communities that people used to interact, 
namely, Usenet, e-mail-lists, bulletin-board systems, and mainly on-line diaries. Today, many 
tools are available for anyone who wants to start periodically sharing his/her thoughts, work, 
hobby, and anything else on the Internet. With just a few clicks you can have a fully functional 
blog with a nice design. In this chapter we are going to create our own design for any kind of 
blog, so our online presence can be understood not only based on what we post in a blog, but 
also on how we present the content on a really personal level.
Creating a simple Web 2.0 style web 
design layout from scratch
Web 2.0 is associated with user interaction, interoperability, user-generated content, blogs, 
web applications, and so on. From a design point of view, a Web 2.0 website has to provide a 
clean, user-centered design to allow developers and users to collaborate with each other in 
the creation of the site content. This is a fairly easy task; you just need to follow the steps, and 
use your own creativity to create a simple Web 2.0 layout.
The template will be a normal image file that you can cut into pieces and convert to HTML 
slices like we've seen in Chapter 2 at the beginning of the Using web design-oriented 
filters task.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create a web design layout:
1.	 Go to Layer | New Layer, and create a new image of around 800x1000 pixels. 
Fill the background with a light gray.
2.	 Go to Layer | New Layer, create a new layer, and name it header. If not enabled, go 
to View | Show Rulers (Ctrl + Shift + R) to make them visible. Click on the Rectangle 
Select Tool, and drag from side to side of the image, around 125 pixels in height.
3.	 Select the Blend Tool, and choose FG to BG (RGB) from the Gradients widget:

Chapter 6
253
4.	 For the header background we are going to use a dark gradient. Pick a color for the 
foreground and a lighter one for the background. Then, drag inside the rectangle from 
top to bottom in a straight line to fill it (use the Ctrl key to easily create a straight line).
5.	 Use the Text Tool to write a company name, pick a font you like and a size of around 
30 pixels. Duplicate the text layer, name it reflection, move it below the original, and 
flip it vertically with the Flip Tool to create a reflection. Use the Select Tool to move 
the reflection layer just below the original text:
6.	 Right-click inside the reflection layer. Select the Add Layer Mask option. Select the 
White (full opacity) option, and press Return. Select the Blend Tool, and reset the 
colors to black and white by clicking inside the little squares at the bottom left side of 
the foreground and background colors.

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
254
7.	
Drag inside the reflection layer from bottom to top in a straight line.
You could also adjust the layer's opacity if you want.
8.	 Create a new layer, and name it menu. Use the Rectangle Select Tool, and draw a 
rectangle from side to side of the image just below the header and around 20 pixels 
in height.
9.	 Pick the Blend Tool, select the FG to BG (RGB) from the Gradients widget, and 
choose a bright color combination for the foreground and background colors. Put the 
brighter one in the background. Write down the color codes in case you change them 
(or later, when you need them, you can always use the Color Picker Tool):
Apply the gradient from bottom to top.

Chapter 6
255
10.	 Create a new layer, and name it tabs. Zoom a little. It will be easier at this point. Use the 
Rectangle Tool, and create a new one of around 85 pixels width and 25 pixels height. 
Tick the Rounded corners box inside the Rectangle Tool properties, and choose a 
radius of around 6. Place the selection a little above the bottom of the menu.
 

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
256
11.	 Fill the selection using the Bucket Fill Tool with the brightest color  you used at the 
bottom of the menu.
12.	Duplicate the tabs layer three or four times, depending on how many menu options 
you want to have. Use the Move Tool to align them horizontally.

Chapter 6
257
13.	Link all the tabs together by clicking the chain icon left of each layer inside the Layers 
dialog. Use the Move Tool to center the tabs:
14.	 Create texts for each tab according to the company:

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
258
15.	Create a new layer, and name it left bar. Use the Rectangle Select Tool (Remember 
to disable the Rounded corners box!), and create a rectangle on the left side of the 
image of around 200 pixels wide and all the way to the bottom of the image. Fill it 
with a dark gray, almost solid black.
16.	 Create a new layer, name it lines, choose a dark shade of grey, draw a line using 
the Pencil Tool, and use a brush size of 0.05 or less. Duplicate the layer, and move 
and align the lines vertically. Each space between lines is to hold an option of the 
submenu for each tab.

Following is how it looks with a some basic content in it:
Creating custom glossy buttons
In this task, you will learn how to create buttons with glossy surfaces that can be easily 
incorporated to any modern Web 2.0 layout for any kind of company.

Chapter 6
261
How to do it...
The following steps show you how to prepare glossy buttons:
1.	 In a new file—transparent file with no background—use the Rectangle Select Tool to 
create a shape of the dimensions you need. Enable the Rounded corners option. For 
my example, I used a radius of around 40 pixels.
Fill the selection with a gray shade, duplicate the layer twice, and name the layers 
top, bottom, and base.
2.	 Use the Ellipse Select Tool, and draw a selection like the following:
3.	 Select the top layer from the Layers Dialog, and go to Edit | Clear. This will erase the 
selected part from the top layer.

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
262
4.	 Select the bottom layer from the Layers Dialog. Use the Fuzzy Select Tool, and click 
inside the image to quickly select the whole layer. Click the Blend Tool, pick a black to 
white gradient, and drag from top-left to bottom-right:
5.	 Now, select the top layer from the Layers Dialog. Use the Fuzzy Select Tool, and click 
inside the image to quickly select the whole layer. Pick a lighter shade of gray to do 
some highlights. Select the FG to BG (RGB) gradient from Gradients, and use the 
Blend Tool to paint a gradient on it.

Chapter 6
263
6.	 Make the top and bottom layer invisible by clicking the eye icon besides them. Select 
the base layer from the Layers dialog. Use the Fuzzy Select Tool and click inside the 
image to quickly select the whole layer. Enable the other two layers by clicking the eye 
icon besides them (without deselecting the base), and go to Select | Shrink. Enter 
an amount around 2 pixels, and hit Return.
7.	
Go to Select | Invert to invert the selection. Click the top layer from the Layers 
dialog, and go to Edit | Clear. Then click the bottom layer from the Layers dialog, 
and clear the layer.

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
264
8.	 Add any text you want to the button.
9.	 Duplicate the text layer. Move it below the original one, and use the Flip Tool to flip it 
vertically. Right-click the duplicated layer's name in the Layers dialog, and select Add 
Layer Mask (make sure the White (full opacity) option is selected). Hit Add in the 
window that appears. Select the Blend Tool, reset the foreground and background 
colors to black and white, and draw a gradient inside the mask.
Adjust the opacity of the duplicated text layer if you need to:

Creating an Art Nouveau inspired 
blog template
Art Nouveau is a movement that developed around the end of the 1800s. It was mainly used 
in decorative arts, architecture, and applied arts. It is characterized by very organic, stylized 
curved lines. In this task we are going to create a basic blog template based on the style of Art 
Nouveau motifs.
Custom blog templates can be tricky to configure. Always save your template 
in a GIMP format, just in case you need  to move things around to adjust them 
to your blog's code. Of course, you can always learn a little HTML and CSS!
Getting ready
Art Nouveau is everywhere. Search the Internet for some examples, artists, and inspiration. 
You can also sketch a few designs.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create your blog theme:
1.	 Create a new file, 1024x900 in size, and, fill the background with a dark solid color.

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
266
2.	 Create a new layer, and name it Border Main Content. Use the Rectangle Select 
Tool to draw a rectangle. Copy the parameters I have used for this example; they 
are as follows:
3.	 Fill the selection with a solid white. Set the layer's opacity to something around 50%. 
Go to Select | Shrink, enter 5, and press OK. Create a new layer, and name it Main 
Content. Fill it with a solid white.

Chapter 6
267

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
268
4.	 Now, let's create two more boxes, one for the menu and another for the profile, links, 
history, or anything you want to put there. For each box, repeat the last few steps to 
create the base border and solid background. Create a new layer, and name it Menu 
Border. Create a rectangle selection with the following settings:
Fill it with a solid white, and change it's opacity to 50%. Create a new layer, and name 
it Menu. Go to Select | Shrink, enter 5, and press OK. Fill it with a solid white.

Chapter 6

5.	 Create a new layer, and name it Menu 2 Border. Create a rectangle selection with the 
following settings:
Fill it with a solid white, and change it's opacity to 50%. Create a new layer, and name 
it Menu 2. Go to Select | Shrink, enter 5, and press OK. Fill it with a solid white.
6.	 This can be the trickiest part. Here is where your investigation about Art Nouveau 
shows it's results. Create a new layer, and using a soft brush and a soft color, start 
drawing some designs. Use simple motives, curved lines, and flower designs.

Chapter 6

Try to use organic shapes. Here, I started with some basic shapes. Once I got to the 
point I'm satisfied, I started adding some shadows/volume:

Chapter 6
273
Then I added a big solid color, and some shiny spots to simulate some kind of gem:

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
274
A little bit of smudging and a few more shadows and it's done. Finally, I added a little 
sunburst, which is very characteristic of the style.
If you can't manage to draw anything, don't despair. Search the web; there 
are lots of royalty-free brushes that you can use to create flower patterns and 
curved lines in no time.
7.	
Create a new layer, use the Rectangle Select Tool, create a small rectangle, and 
apply the following parameters to it:

Chapter 6
275
8.	 Fill it with a solid white, and change it's opacity to 50%. Create a new layer, go to 
Select | Shrink, enter 5, and press OK. Fill it with a solid white:

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
276
9.	 Now merge these newly created layers into one. Go to Layers | Merge down. Rename 
the merged layer to tab.
Use the Move Tool to position the tab just above the content box. Select the Eraser 
Tool and delete the overlapping borders.
10.	 Duplicate the tab layer, and distribute them along the top of the content box!

The template is ready now; you need to decide where you are going to put your 
content, and that's it. Following is my finished piece. I added a tiled background 
to add a little more color.

How to create an Impressionist inspired 
template
We are going to take advantage of a filter that comes with GIMP 2.6 that probably would make 
Monet very angry (as he is considered the father of Impressionism). Though it's a good way to 
quickly turn any photo or drawing into a sort-of impressionistic piece.
Usually, impressionistic art has many different subjects. Depending on the many painters 
that embraced and developed it through time, people, furniture, cities, landscapes, still life, 
almost anything has been represented. However, all of them have things in common: there's 
an interest in light and how it changes, how time passes, movement, and the need to express 
the perception of nature rather than simply trying to duplicate it on a canvas. That's why we 
can see so many strange colors and forms instead of a perfect body, a perfect face, a perfect 
building, and so on.
Getting ready
This is another example of how to create any kind of template from just an idea. Research 
Impressionism as much as you want. Personally it is one of my favorite art movements and 
includes many of the most famous painters from the 19th century.
Once you are satisfied with your research, pick a series of photographs. Try to pick a theme. 
Two or three photos will be enough.

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
280
How to do it...
The following steps will show you how to create an Impressionistic template:
1.	 For this task, I decided to make a really quick and rough sketch:
(Told you it was rough). As you can see, there's no sign yet at all of how we are going 
to make it look, just a faint notion on where I want to put things like content, menus, 
and so on.

Chapter 6
281
I decided to use two photos. The following one is for the background of the blog:

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
282
The following one is for the header. We are going to crop it and edit it to take 
advantage of the colors and shapes, and make our blog a little more abstract:

Chapter 6
283
2.	 My rough sketch is 1024x1024 pixels, so I'm going to work directly on it, pick a photo 
for the background, and place it on a new layer. (One way of doing this is to copy 
and paste. Click on the New layer button to place it in it's own layer). In my case, the 
photo was too big, so this is how it looks after scaling and moving it around a little to 
the place where I like:

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
284
Place it below the sketch layer:
3.	 Now let's use the GIMPressionist filter. Select your background layer and go to 
Filters | Artistic | GIMPressionist. This is a complex filter, not because it's hard to 
use, but because it has lots of options that you can use to get many different results. 
You should experiment until you get the result you like best. After you change any 
option you can press the Update button to see how it modifies the image. Here are 
the settings I used for my background:


Presets:


Paper: These are textures that simulates different kinds of media, like paper, 
cloth, marble, and stone.

Chapter 6
285


Brush: This tab contains a wide variety of brushes that simulates material 
used to paint.

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
286


Orientation: Here, you can change the orientation of the brush strokes. 
You can set the direction of the strokes based on different parameters 
(Value, Radius, Random, Radial, Flowing, Hue, Adaptive), and there's 
also a Manual setting which opens a window that allows you to set the 
direction manually.


Size: This tab allows you to change the minimum and maximum sizes for the 
brush strokes, and how they are determined based on different parameters 
similar to Orientation.

Chapter 6
287


Placement: Here you can configure how the strokes are distributed.

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
288
I didn't change anything in the Color and the General tabs. As I said all along, it's 
better if you experiment with the different parameters instead of trying to duplicate 
the exact effect. Here's how my background looks after applying the filter:
You can see that the filter only modified the selected layer.

Chapter 6
289
4.	 Create a new layer, and name it content boxes. We are going to draw the content 
boxes in it. Lock the background and the sketch layers by clicking the lock icon 
besides each name inside the Layers window. Place the new layer between them.
5.	 Using the Rectangle Select Tool, draw a rectangle, and place it near the sketch lines. 
Use the Position and Size parameters in the tool options to place the selection box 
exactly where you want. I like rounded corners for these template, so I enabled them.
 

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
290
Fill the rectangle using the Bucket Fill Tool with a solid white, with it's opacity 
around 25%:
5.	 Now, create the other content boxes. Draw a new rectangle selection—with the 
Rectangle Select Tool—inside the big one you just created. Then, click on the 
Subtract from the current Selection icon inside the tool options, and draw 
another rectangle inside:

Chapter 6
291
Clear the selection. This should give you the following result:
See that I changed the design a little from the sketch; thought it will be better to have 
a wider main content area.

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
292
6.	 Repeat the previous operation for each box of your sketch.
See how I used guides to help me draw each box and keep them aligned? 

Chapter 6
293
Guides are horizontal or vertical lines that are not part of the image, and that 
you can temporarily display on top of any image while you are working on it. 
Creating a guide is easy; just click on the ruler, and drag into the image. A new 
guide will appear, and you can position it in any place you need. To move an 
already positioned guide, you need to use the Move Tool. To delete a guide, 
simply drag it outside the image. If you enable the View | Snap to Guides 
option from the menu, the pointer will snap to the guide closest to it. You can 
hide the guides toggling the View | Show Guides from the menu. Finally, you 
can delete all the guides with the Image | Guides | Remove all guides option 
from the menu.
7.	
So far, we have a sort-of impressionistic background and some content space. We 
can create a header to make it look better and add more cohesion to the design. Pick 
a new photo; keep in mind we don't have lots of space left, so we are going to crop it, 
and then make it look like a painting.

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
294
8.	 Place the new photo as a layer on top of everything else, and name it header. Set it's 
opacity to 40% to see what's below it and use the transform tools to place it where 
you want.

Chapter 6
295
See how I completely deformed it. What I'm trying to do here is to have some organic 
shapes that will be turned into some kind of surreal impressionistic drawing. I used 
the Fuzzy Select Tool to quickly erase parts of the header image:

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
296
9.	 There are still parts that can be deleted, but let's try the GIMPressionist filter again 
to see how it changes our header photo. Go to Filters | Artistic | GIMPressionist...:
I applied it using the same settings that I used for the background image, as you can 
see, it doesn't look quite good. This is always part of the design process: Try things 
out, if they don't work, don't get frustrated, and try again until you like it.

Chapter 6
297
10.	 So, after a few minutes, these are the settings that worked for me:


Presets: The flowerbed preset is always a good way to start for me:


Paper: In this case, the default paper texture works best for this image:

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
298


Brush: Okay, now this looks like I'm just going along with the default settings, 
but really, try modifying the Amplitude and Gamma settings.


Orientation: Here, I decided to use a Radial orientation


Size: The size of the brush always has to be configured based on the image 
size on which we are working:

Chapter 6
299


Placement: I used a random distribution of the brush strokes with a 
medium density:

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
300
I didn't touch the other two tabs. This is how the header ended up after applying the 
GIMPressionist filter:
11.	 In the original picture, I used as a background, there is a man looking at a window 
with his bicycle. Now, it's a little blurry, but it's obvious that there is a figure there. I 
liked the idea of him looking at the content, so I selected the content boxes layer, 
and with the Eraser Tool, I stared clearing the boxes over the man's figure:

Chapter 6
301

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
302
I had to make a decision on where to stop deleting, so I decided that anything below 
his shoulder should fade. This is a typical decision you will have to make when 
applying an idea to a design that looks like it's finished but that may still need a little 
more work. Also, I decided to put the header layer below the content boxes. That's it!

Chapter 6
303
Creating headers for your blog/website
Jus like the previous recipes, this one is also like a basic guide to create a header, rather than 
a set of instructions to make a header for a blog or website. Let's think that it's some kind of 
company that sells horses, and we just need to create a header for this website.
For our horse-selling website, we need a header of 593x102 pixels. It's a little small, but it's a 
good way of teaching a lesson about dealing with customers. Many times someone asks us to 
do a design work that's not based on standard parameters, configuration, or styles. We have 
three choices here: accept the work, propose changes to the site before starting our work (of 
course this usually implies more time and money), or accept the customer conditions, and use 
our creativity to do a good job with what we have at hand. In this case, we are going to create 
the header the customer wants.
Getting ready
Each header must be designed according to how the website looks. You don't want to create 
a header for anyone without knowing what kind of content the website or blog holds or how it 
has been designed, the color palette being used, and other features of the site. For this task, 
we will be creating a header for the Web 2.0 layout we created in the first task of this chapter:
 

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
304
How to do it...
Headers always have a fixed width and height, it depends on the website dimensions. If it's a 
blog, there are also a few standard sizes that vary accordingly to where the site is hosted, or 
the template you are using.
1.	 Go to File | New, and create a new file with the dimensions we need (593x102 
pixels). Save it (File | Save) with a proper name, and leave it for now.
2.	 Get a photo of a horse racing; search for a royalty-free one, as we are not going to 
actually use the photo, just use it as a model for our header. I found one that I 
liked here: 
http://www.horseracingphoto.co.uk/category/photos/flat
3.	 Open it in GIMP. Create a new layer, name it solid background, and fill it with a solid 
black. Place this layer below the image layer. Now create another new layer, and 
name it silhouette, place it on top of the other two, and keep it selected.
4.	 Select a solid white for the foreground color.

Chapter 6
305
5.	 Now, patiently use the Path Tool to trace the silhouette of the horse. Use the Zoom 
Tool to be more accurate, but don't get obsessed. Keep in mind that our header is not 
too big, and we don't need lots of detail.

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
306
To close the path, click on the initial control point you placed. Following is how my 
path looks after going all around the horse's figure:
6.	 When you finish with the Path Tool, click on the Stroke Path button in the tool 
properties window:

Chapter 6
307
In the Stroke Path window, click on the Stroke button, and view the results:
There's our race horse silhouette!

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
308
7.	
With the silhouette layer still selected, go to Select | All and Edit | Copy. Save and 
close the horse picture file to preserve it. Now, we need to paste the silhouette into 
the real header file (so far we've been working on the downloaded horse image, 
remember?). So, go to  the Windows menu, and choose the header file you created 
in Step 1 of this recipe (or if you closed it, go to File | Load to reopen it). Go to Edit | 
Paste, and click the new layer icon at the bottom-left side of the Layers dialog.
This will put the horse silhouette in it's own layer. Name it silhouette.
If you created the file with a solid background, delete that layer now. We want a 
transparent header.
8.	 Following is how my header looks so far:
Not very interesting, I know! Use the Flip Tool to flip it horizontally.

Chapter 6
309
9.	 Now, duplicate the layer by going to Layer | Duplicate Layer, and use the Scale Tool 
and the Move Tool to adjust it to a size that you like:
10.	 Select the other layer, and use the Scale Tool and the Move Tool to create another 
little horse on the left side of the header.

Web Design Tips: Buttons and Blogs
310
11.	 Use the Perspective Tool to make the silhouettes appear as they are coming 
or going.
12.	Duplicate each layer twice; use the Move Tool to place two of the copies a little far 
from the original. Set their opacity around 60% and 40% to simulate movement.
13.	Repeat these last steps with the other horse layer.

Chapter 6
311
14.	 This very basic header is done now. See how it blends with the original layout:

Introduction
Backgrounds are usually relegated to the last part of the design process of a website. Once 
the general layout is defined, we just take some elements from it, mix and twist, and come up 
with a background that fits the design.
In this chapter, we are going to create several images that can work as backgrounds for any 
site, maybe directly or with some changes, but always starting from scratch—just a new file 
and no site at all in our minds. This is a great exercise, not only to develop our GIMP skills, 
but also to discover that there are always different ways to start designing a website.
Creating a colorful abstract background
Abstract art can be defined in many ways; one of them is to think that an abstract piece has 
elements that have no or almost no reference in the real world. In this task, we are going to 
create an abstract image with that idea as a starting point.

Web Design Tips: Backgrounds
314
Getting ready
A background for a website can have different dimensions based on how the site looks. For 
these recipes, I'll be using 1280 x 1024 pixel images. Be aware that this is not a standard 
background size.
How to do it...
The following steps will show you how to create an abstract background:
1.	 In a new file, go to Filters | Render | Clouds | Plasma. Click the Randomize button 
until a color combination that you like appears. Keep the Turbulence slider around 1:
Click OK, and you will get plasma clouds as shown in the following sceenshot:

Chapter 7
315
2.	 Go to Filters | Distorts | Whirl and Pinch, play a little with the settings, and click OK:

Web Design Tips: Backgrounds
316
3.	 Create a new transparent layer, and name it fade. Use the Blend Tool to create a 
Radial gradient from white to black:
4.	 Duplicate the fade layer, name the copy light, and place it above the original. Set the 
fade layer's mode to Multiply:

Chapter 7
317
5.	 Click the light layer, and reapply the Whirl and Pinch filter (Ctrl + F) to it with the 
same settings as the last time. Set its mode to Dodge:

Web Design Tips: Backgrounds
318
The Multiply layer mode creates darker images by multiplying the pixels of the 
upper layer by the ones in the layer below, and then dividing the result by 255. 
Multiply is useful when sketching, to keep the lineart on top of the others.
The Dodge layer mode creates brighter images by multiplying the pixels on 
the lower image by 256 and dividing the result by the inverse value of the 
pixel of the top layer. Sometimes this creates color inverted areas too. These 
modes can be set in paint tools as well. In this case, it's useful to enhance 
details in dark areas.
Don't try to copy it directly, experiment with different gradient settings and opacity.

Creating a green time-machine background
This is another quick abstract background based on some filters. Remember that you can 
always try different settings; experiment and completely change how the final image looks 
by changing any setting during the task.
Getting ready
A background for a website can have different dimensions, according to how the site looks. 
For these backgrounds, I'll be using 1280 x 1024 pixel images (Be aware that this is not a 
standard background size).
How to do it...
The following steps will show how to create a background reminiscent of a time-machine trip:
1.	 Go to Filters | Render | Clouds | Solid Noise. Check the Randomize and Turbulent 
boxes. Use a detail level of 4 or 5:

Creating a light spikes background
Within a few minutes, and after using one of the best filters in GIMP, we can come up with 
a great variety of different backgrounds.
Getting ready
A background for a website can have different dimensions, according to how the site looks. 
For this background, I'll be using 1280x1024 pixel images (Be aware that this is not a 
standard background size).

Creating a retro dots background
"Retro" can be almost anything. It usually defines something not too old but outdated or 
aged. It's use in graphic media is vast. In our examples here, we are going to define retro as 
something that's no longer considered "modern". We can relate to it, but without nostalgia.
Getting ready
As usual, we need some documentation and need to spend some time trying to understand 
what's considered a retro style. Also, a background for a website can have different 
dimensions, according to how the site looks. For this background, I'll be using 1280 x 1024 
pixel images (Be aware that this is not a standard background size).
How to do it...
The following steps will show you how to create a retro background:
1.	 Create a new 640 x 480 file with a white background. Create a new layer, and name 
it dot. With the Rectangle Select Tool, create different rectangles, and fill some of 
them with a solid black using the Bucket Fill Tool. You should get something that 
looks like the following image:

Introduction
Being an open-source project, GIMP provides a great way for users to enrich the project 
capabilities. Plugins enable developers to extend GIMP functionality without the need to 
modify the complex and huge core source files. A plugin is an external program that is called 
within the GIMP environment and can interact with it.
Plugins can be written by anyone with enough coding skills, but as they are executable 
programs, there are security concerns that you need to be aware of before using them. Any 
user can create a plugin and post it for download on his/her personal page, but also anybody 
could download it, add malicious code, and redistribute it. So, you should only install plugins 
downloaded from known sites. There are quite a few websites for this, but there's also an 
official repository where developers test and check all the submitted plugins to detect security 
issues and also optimize them. The official GIMP plugin repository is at http://registry.
gimp.org/.

Plugins and Scripts
342
A fresh GIMP installation comes with several plugins. Most of them can be found in the Filters 
menu. Also, many times, plugins are written for a specific GIMP version; this implies that 
changes are necessary on the plugin code to make it work on a different version than the one 
for which it was written. So before installing a new plugin, check its documentation to know if 
it will work with your GIMP version.
As plugins are developed by users, many times their code is not exactly 'stable', so there will be 
times when a plugin crashes. GIMP can detect this and show you an error. It's wise to save and 
backup your work each time you use a new, recently-installed plugin, to avoid unexpected things 
happening after a plugin crash. Also, it may be good to restart GIMP after a plugin crash.
Installing plugins and scripts
Installing new plugins is not difficult, most of the time it is a straightforward task. Continue 
reading to see how to install a GIMP plugin successfully.
Getting ready
As I mentioned earlier, you should always download and install plugins from known sources. 
The official GIMP plugin registry is at http://registry.gimp.org/, so that's the safest 
place. There is also no registration required for downloads.
How to do it...
The following steps show how to install a GIMP plugin:
1.	 Go to http://registry.gimp.org/, and search for the plugin you need. 
Download the plugin package file from the same page, select the file accordingly 
to your operating system.
2.	 In all cases, the downloaded file is a compressed file. Extract the files inside the 
plugin to a new folder.
3.	 Usually there is an INSTALL or a README file. Check those to see if there are 
any special steps to install the specific plugin. Many times, plugins need to be 
compiled. Follow the steps in the README and the INSTALL files to build your 
plugin successfully. To install and build plugins on Windows, first you have to 
set up a developing-environment. This implies software installation, time, and 
effort, because Windows doesn't come with the tools by default.

Chapter 8
343
Depending on the installation procedure for each plugin, sometimes a manual 
copy of files is also required; this varies on each operating system:
f
f
Linux: Depending on your distribution, the path can vary, but if you 
want just your user to be able to use the plugin, move the files to the 
following hidden directory in your home directory: ~/gimp-[GIMP_
VERSION]/plug-ins/, where [GIMP_VERSION] is the version 
of GIMP you have installed. For this book, I've been using GIMP 2.6, 
so my full path is ~/.gimp-2.6/plug-ins/. If you want any user 
to be able to use the plugin, you have to move its files into the plug-
ins/ directory in the main application directory. As I said, this varies 
with each Linux distribution, but typing whereis gimp can show you 
a list of directories where you can search for the plug-ins directory. 
f
f
Windows: GIMP installs by default to your Program Files/ directory, 
so look inside it for a plug-ins folder. Move the plugin files in to it.
4.	 If GIMP is open, restart it, just to be sure the plugin directory is re-read and the 
plugin installed.
5.	 Test the plugin. If the plugin is for opening a new filetype, try opening a file of that 
kind. If it's another kind of plugin, check its documentation to know where it loads 
in the menu, or search for it in the menus!
There's more...
If you are interested in writing your own plugins, be aware that this is an advanced task. There 
are hundreds of plugins out there, and there is a great chance that what you want to do has 
already been implemented by a user or a group of users somewhere. Always check the plugin 
repository first before you start coding something from scratch. You could always join an 
existing project if you find somebody already working on what you need.
There are three main sites where you can get information on how to start coding:
http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-scripting.html#plugins-write
http://developer.gimp.org/plug-ins.html
http://www.home.unix-ag.org/simon/gimp/guadec2002/gimp-plugin/html/
The URLs are from the official GIMP documentation, on http://developer.gimp.org/. 
You can also learn about how the main code is built and the overall program architecture.
Plugins are not the only way to add functionality to GIMP. It also has a built-in macro language 
that users use mostly for automating repetitive or complex tasks. The Script-Fu language is 
based on Scheme, an interpreted language with its own syntax rules.

Plugins and Scripts
344
GIMP comes with many scripts that you can use as a base for your own scripts and learn the 
language in the process. There are also many sites where you can download and use user-
created scripts.  Go to Edit | Preferences | Folders | Scripts to see the path where you have 
to copy your downloaded or new scripts (or check the default scripts) to make them available 
in GIMP. There is no need to restart GIMP after installing new scripts, just go to Filters | 
Script-fu | Refresh Filters to reload all. Through the Script-fu console (Filters | Script-fu 
| Console) you can test single commands and see if your syntax is right, and browse the 
language functions and descriptions. The Script-fu syntax can be tricky sometimes with its 
parenthesis and space between operators.
Finally, through other plugins, you can add other languages, like Perl, TCL, and others. 
Search the plugin registry at http://registry.gimp.org.
Using the 3D Screenshot script
This script turns any image into a 3D composition with reflections, shadows, and glow. 
Download it from http://registry.gimp.org/node/3479.
Getting ready
To install this script, download and move the .scm file into your scripts folder. Check the 
right path from Edit | Preferences | Folders | Scripts. Restart GIMP if it's already running.
How to do it...
First, load an image into GIMP that you wish to convert to a 3D screenshot. I used 
the following:

Chapter 8
345
1.	 Open the 3D Screenshot window by going to Filters | Script-Fu | 3d Screenshot.
2.	 Choose the layer with which you want to work. Experiment a little with the 
parameters. The Gradient (top) and Gradient (bottom) parameters define the 
background color. If you change them, change the Shadow parameter accordingly 
to match with the background:

Plugins and Scripts
346
Following is the final piece:
The script creates several new layers which you can rearrange (or continue editing) to improve 
the composition.
Using the Midnight Sepia script
This script is great for making quick postcards. It adds a subtle sepia effect while keeping 
some of the original colors and enhancing them. Download it from http://registry.
gimp.org/node/10980.

Chapter 8
347
Getting ready
To install this script, download and move the .scm files into you scripts folder. Check the 
right path from Edit | Preferences | Folders | Scripts. Restart GIMP if it's already running.
How to do it...
Load an image into GIMP to which you wish to give a sepia effect. I used the 
following image:
1.	 Open the Midnight Sepia window by going to Filters | Artistic | Midnight Sepia.

Plugins and Scripts
348
2.	 Adjust the parameters as you need. The Work on Copy checkbox is useful if you want 
to keep working on the original image.

Chapter 8
349
Following is the final piece:
Using the Star Scape script
This script renders a sky full of stars with the colored background of your choice. Download it 
from http://registry.gimp.org/node/297.

Plugins and Scripts
350
Getting ready
To install this script, download and move the .scm files into your scripts folder. Check the 
right path from Edit | Preferences | Folders | Scripts. Restart GIMP if it's already running.
How to do it...
Carry out the following steps to create a star scape:
1.	 Since this script renders a new image, you have to search for it in the File menu. 
Go to File | Create | Render | Star Scape:
2.	 Adjust the parameters. The following are the parameters I used:

Chapter 8
351
Following is the final piece:
Using the Antique Photo Border script
This script adds a rounded rough border to a picture, simulating a very old photograph. 
Download it from http://registry.gimp.org/node/9329.
Getting ready
To install this plugin, download and move the .scm file into your scripts folder. Check the 
right path from Edit | Preferences | Folders | Scripts. Restart GIMP if it's already running.
 

Plugins and Scripts
352
How to do it...
Load an image into GIMP to which you wish to give an antique photograph effect. I used the 
following image:
1.	 Open the Antique Photo Border window by going to Filters | Decor | Antique 
Photo Border:

Chapter 8
353
2.	  Change the parameters, and experiment a little here. The Distress Granularity value 
changes the roughness of the place where the photo and the added border meets. 
The Motion Blur value sets the amount of blur to apply to the new border.
Following is the final piece:
The border is created in its own layer, so you can continue editing the original file, perhaps 
adding some texture to it to improve the old look effect.
Using the National Geographic script
This script simulates a high quality photo such as the ones we usually see in the famous 
magazine. It's originally for using with portrait photography but I found it comes handy when 
you want to quickly color-correct any photo. Download it from http://registry.gimp.
org/node/9592.

Plugins and Scripts
354
Getting ready
To install this script, download and move the .scm file into your scripts folder. Check the 
right path from Edit | Preferences | Folders | Scripts. Restart GIMP if it's already running.
How to do it...
Load an image into GIMP, I used the following image:

Chapter 8
355
1.	 This plugin works on the active layer, so if you want to keep working on the 
original photo, make a duplicate of the layer and lock it before you start 
working with the script.
2.	 Open the script options window by going to Filters | Generic | National Geographic, 
and try different settings. The Local Contrast value can really enhance colors and 
make them stand out.

Plugins and Scripts
356
Following is the final piece:
Using the Watermark script
This script adds customizable text inside a photo, which is useful when you want to create a 
high-quality portfolio, and you want to be sure that nobody uses them without your permission. 
Download it from http://registry.gimp.org/node/6703.

Chapter 8
357
Getting ready
To install this script, download and move the .scm file into your scripts folder. Check the 
right path from Edit | Preferences | Folders | Scripts. Restart GIMP if it's already running.
How to do it...
Load an image into GIMP. I used the following image:

Plugins and Scripts
358
1.	 Open the Watermark option window by going to Script-Fu | My Scripts | Watermark. 
You can customize the font, text, size, position, and opacity of the watermark. In my 
experience, I've tried to avoid using bold fonts.
Following is the final piece:

Chapter 8
359
2.	 If you want to position the watermark in another place after applying the script, then 
go to Edit | Undo Flatten Image. The text will be in its own layer that you can position 
anywhere you like or adjust the opacity.

Plugins and Scripts
360
Using the Save for Web plugin
This plugin enables you to optimize high-resolution images, and save them for web use 
without losing much quality. Download it from http://registry.gimp.org/node/33.
Getting ready
This plugin can be tricky to install, especially in Windows. Have a little patience, and follow 
the instructions given in the README file that comes with the file you downloaded.
How to do it...
Load an image into GIMP. I used the following image:

Chapter 8
361
1.	 Go to File | Save for Web. The image I am using as an example is way too big for the 
Web, so click the tab on the right:
Here you can set the new image size; for my example I used 800 x 600 pixels. At the 
bottom of the window, you can see the approximate file size after the image size has 
been changed:
2.	 Don't save it yet! Select the image format you want and go back to the tab on 
the left, shift the Quality slider, and watch the approximate file size change:
3.	 Click the Save button, choose the destination directory, and the plugin will generate 
your optimized-for-web file in it.

Plugins and Scripts
362
Using the DBP Plugin
This is a powerful plugin that can save you lots of hours of mechanical work. Think when 
you have to edit, resize, rotate, or apply different filters to many files. With this plugin, you 
can select them, configure which operation to perform, process and save them with the 
same filename or in another folder.  Download it from http://members.ozemail.com.
au/~hodsond/dbp.html.
Getting ready
You will have to compile this plugin to install it. Also in Linux you will need to install gimptool 
to install the plugin without any manual work—check the plugin documentation.
How to do it...
The following steps show how to use the DBP plugin to process many files:
1.	 Open GIMP and bring up DBP's option window by going to Filters | Batch Process:

Chapter 8
363
2.	 Click the Add Files button to load the files you want to process.
3.	 There are a lot of operations that can be done with this plugin. Here, we are going to 
auto-level the colors for each image, so click the Colour tab. Select the Enable and 
the Auto-levels checkboxes:
 

Plugins and Scripts
364
4.	 If you want to keep the original files intact (I recommend you always keep them!), 
click the Rename tab, and click the SelectDir button to choose a path where the 
processed files will be created. You can define how you want these files to be named 
by entering a prefix and postfix text.
5.	 Click the Output tab to select a file format for the processed files:

Chapter 8
365
6.	 Click the Start button to process the files.
Following a similar procedure you can run any process on a group or batch of files.

Beyond GIMP
GIMP is distributed under a GPL, which means that anyone can download and use the 
program for free (of course there are some limitations on this. Check GIMP's license page 
for details: http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/legal.html). It also enables anyone 
to download the complete source code, modify it, and build new projects. There are a few 
different projects out there that were created with specific goals. This appendix provides 
information about two different projects: GIMP Paint Studio (or GPS) and CinePaint.
GIMP Paint Studio
GPS is an interesting approach on GIMP modifications. It's not a completely separate entity 
than GIMP, as the home page says:
"GPS is a collection of brushes and accompanying tool presets intended to speed 
up repetitive tasks by avoiding the need to manually reset tool options after each 
change. Tool presets are a simply saved tool options, a seldom discussed but highly 
useful feature of the GIMP."

Beyond GIMP
368
However, GPS is not only a collection of brushes and tool presets:
"The goal of GPS is to provide an adequate working environment for graphic 
designers and artists to begin to paint and feel comfortable with GIMP from their 
first use. Later the user will change these settings based on his own workflow 
preferences and understanding of GIMP."
GPS is basically for digital artists who don't find GIMP's default setup easy to work with for 
creating any kind of illustrations. There is also an active user base that share experiences, 
ideas, and artwork.

CinePaint
CinePaint started in 2008 as a fork from the GIMP version 1.0.4, and it is considered one of 
the most-used open-source tools in motion pictures. It's even been used in mainstream movie 
productions like Scooby Doo, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, The Last Samurai, and 
many others.
Its primary use is for individual frame editing and retouching, and runs only on UNIX platforms. 
It has many features and allows the user to work with 8, 16, and 32 bit-color channels, CMYK 
editing, and several high dynamic range file formats as OpenEXR and Cineon and DPX that 
allow working with highcolor fidelity.
Keep in mind, this is not a movie editor, CinePaint handles individual frames and lets you work 
on them separately. There are a few tools that enable the user to work with more than one 
frame at a time (like onion skinning and the frame manager).

Platform-specific projects
Historically, GIMP's main platform is Linux, but as the source code is available, with time 
and some patience, any user can download it and compile his/her own GIMP binaries for a 
specific platform. Luckily, there are a few platform-specific GIMP communities that build their 
own versions of the software to try and make GIMP available on them, and make more and 
more people use it without having to spend lots of time trying to install or dealing with source 
code. There are more than one of these implementations for each platform (some of them are 
updated, a few others are abandoned or inactive). I will introduce just one of them here for 
each of the main operating systems.
GIMP on OS X
This is an active community that builds universal GIMP binaries (both for PC and Intel-based 
Macs) for OS X 10.4.x (Tiger), 10.5.x (Leopard), and 10.6.x (Snow Leopard). You can get it 
at http://gimp.lisanet.de.
They also provide a selection of very useful photo-editing plugins and they have an active 
forum at http://sourceforge.net/projects/gimponosx/forums for discussing 
releases, help, and development.
GIMP-WIN
This site provides GIMP installers for Microsoft Windows. Check their frequently asked 
questions section (http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/faq.html) to learn more

Release Changes
In this chapter, we will cover the most important changes introduced in GIMP 2.6: a few 
interface changes and some tool functionality.
Introduction
GIMP has a consistent developer base that improves it, not only by fixing potential problems 
with the software, but also by investing time and effort in designing new features to keep it on 
top of any other open-source photo manipulation and drawing software. GIMP 2.6 has one of 
the first open-source implementations of the GEGL library that will allow, in future versions, 
the ability to use high big-depth and non-destructive editing.
Keeping this in mind, it's not strange that the current latest version (version 2.6) is considered 
as a transition towards the big GIMP v3.0 launch.
Besides this, there are a few changes made to the user interface to solve some issues 
reported by the user community.
Interface changes
A few interface and tool changes were introduced in GIMP 2.6. They are not only cosmetic, 
but intended to improve usability.

Release Changes
372
Toolbox menubar removed
A new "Empty image window" is created to host the menubar when no image is open. It allows 
you to drag and drop files to open them.
Toolbox and Dock bars now are tool windows better prepared to stay on top of the main 
windows, not appearing in the taskbar, improving the on-screen organization. This is the 
default GIMP interface just after starting it.

Appendix B
373
Scrolling beyond the image border
Now you can pan the image beyond its border when a utility window covers a portion of the 
image or when you paint on the border of an image that fills the entire window:
There are a few minor interface changes that are worth mentioning here because they 
improve usability:
f
f
The Dialog menu is now named Windows.
f
f
History of recent closed Docks, and the ability to reopen them.
f
f
The zoom ratio can be manually entered in the status bar.
f
f
If you use the context help function from the Help menu, you can click on an item in 
the GIMP about which you want more information, and it will connect you to the GIMP 
website via the GIMP browser or a standard web browser.
f
f
Tabs can be locked on Docks to prevent accidental moving.

Tool changes
Two important changes were introduced. Polygonal selection was added to the Free Select 
Tool, and the ability to use pressure and/or velocity with brushes was introduced. To use the 
new polygonal selection, use the Free Select Tool, and instead of clicking-and-dragging, just 
click once. This creates an anchor point. Move the mouse pointer to draw a straight line, click 
again to insert another anchor point, and click the fist one to close the selection. You can also 
combine free-hand and polygonal selection.
Select Tool
The Select Tool now supports polygonal selection by enabling the use of polygonal segments 
with angle-constraints and combining it with free hand segments.
Brush dynamics
This feature allows GIMP to detect and use values as pressure and velocity to modify brush 
parameters such as size, hardness, and opacity, which are crucial to the painting process of 
any illustrator or animator. This also works as a feature in stroking paths, where GIMP assigns 
values of pressure and velocity along the length of the stroke.
There are also a few minor changes:
f
f
Automatic wrapping inside a resizable box for the Text Tool.
f
f
Resizing boxes now wrap on the outside of blocks that are too small to include them. 
(Like when we want to resize a rectangle that is too thin.)
f
f
The size of the brush for the Smudge Tool can now be scaled.
f
f
The PSD import plugin has been improved.
f
f
The Desaturate Tool now has a preview.

Appendix B

f
f
The color tools now allow preset loading and saving, namely, allowing 
reusable color balances.
f
f
The Flame plugin now has 22 new variations.
GEGL
Non-destructive editing has become one of the objectives for the state-of-the-art image 
processing community. This involves algorithms that not only perform modifications to an 
image, but also extract complex data from the original file to allow a potential rollback of 
each operation, and also to accelerate tedious tasks such as scaling an image by modifying 
proportions. Since version 2.6, GIMP has a tentative GEGL implementation which will be 
gradually improved to a final version that will come out on the future GIMP v3.0
Plugin changes/news
GIMP Plugin development is a non-stop project that involves countless people beyond the 
development team improving and creating new ways of expanding GIMP. This includes the 
language to build plugins and procedures which can now give detailed error descriptions 
and the error can be propagated to the user. Script-Fu was cleaned up and many bug fixes 
were implemented.
For a complete list of the API's please check:

Backwards compatibility
There were some issues with GIMP 2.4 plugins that were solved. GIMP should run scripts 
since versions 2.0 and 2.2 without problems.
Known problems
Some problems still exist in GIMP 2.6. The following are the known problems:
f
f
The Hint utility window only works well within GNOME or Windows starting from GIMP 
2.6.1.
f
f
The Text Tool is still being optimized and the plan is to have it working fine for GIMP 
v2.8.
f
f
When compiling GIMP, if you don't have GVFs support you need to add a –without-
gvfs to the configure script to be able to open remote files.

Running GIMP for the first time
GIMP is not a simple piece of software; each tool has many options and settings—ways that 
you can use to perform different things. This is why as a reminder for the experienced user or 
as an introduction for beginners, we are going to cover the basics of the software quickly.
GIMP runs in many languages and platforms; each one has it's own installation procedure. My 
point in this book is not to give a tutorial for installing GIMP on each one, but to show you the 
general options and guide you to run it without trouble, so you can get to work in no time! The 
open software community has been working for years and years developing reliable operating 
systems and applications (such as Linux and GIMP!) that have nothing to envy commercial 
products. The screenshots and examples you will see throughout all the book are taken from 
Linux, one of the most powerful and most-used, open operating systems in the world. GIMP 
was originally developed for it.
GIMP runs on many platforms; usually you start it by clicking on an icon or by typing gimp 
on a command line (you can add a filename or a list of filenames after the program name 
to open the file(s) in GIMP automatically). If your operating system supports it, you can also 
associate GIMP with any graphic file extension (such as PNG, JPG, and others) to open the 
file with it quickly.
A typical Ubuntu Linux main menu with GIMP preinstalled looks like the following: you can see 
Wilber there, GIMP's official pet!
It doesn't matter how you start it. The following is the GIMP 2.6 main screen running on Linux:
 

Appendix B
377
Command-line arguments
GIMP can be run with no command line at all, but a few of them are useful when you have 
to process more than one file—this is called a batch job. There are many tasks that can be 
automated with GIMP, from basic operations such as applying a filter to complex tasks.
-?, --help
Display a list of all command line options.
--help-all
Show all help options.
--help-gtk
Show GTK+ options.
-v, --version
Print the GIMP version and exit.
--license
Show license information and exit.
--verbose
Show detailed start-up messages.
-n, --new-instance
Start a new GIMP instance.
-a, --as-new
Open images as new.
-i, --no-interface
Run without a user interface.

Release Changes
378
-d, --no-data
Do not load patterns, gradients, palettes, or brushes. Often 
useful in non-interactive situations where the start-up time 
is to be minimized.
-f, --no-fonts
Do not load any fonts. This is useful to load GIMP faster for 
scripts that do not use fonts, or to find problems related to 
malformed fonts that hang GIMP. 
-s, --no-splash
Do not show the splash screen while starting.
--no-shm
Do not use shared memory between GIMP and plugins. 
--no-cpu-accel
Do not use special CPU acceleration functions. Useful 
for finding or disabling buggy accelerated hardware or 
functions.
--session=name
Use a different sessionrc for this GIMP session. The 
given session name is appended to the default sessionrc 
filename. 
--gimprc=filename
Use an alternative gimprc instead of the default one. The 
gimprc file contains a record of your preferences. Useful in 
cases where plugins paths or machine specifications may be 
different. 
--system-gimprc=filename
Use an alternate system gimprc file.
-b, --batch=commands
Execute the set of commands non-interactively. The set of 
commands is typically in the form of a script that can be 
executed by one of the GIMP scripting extensions. When the 
command is -, commands are read from standard input. 
--batch-interpreter=proc
Specify the procedure to use to process batch commands. 
The default procedure is Script-Fu.
--console-messages
Do not popup dialog boxes on errors or warnings. Print the 
messages on the console instead.
--pdb-compat-mode=mode
PDB compatibility mode (off|on|warn).
--stack-trace-mode=mode
Debug in case of a crash (never|query|always).
--debug-handlers
Enable non-fatal debugging signal handlers. Useful for GIMP 
debugging.
--g-fatal-warnings
Make all warnings fatal. Useful for debugging.
--dump-gimprc
Output a gimprc file with default settings. Useful if you 
messed up the gimprc file.
--display=display
Use the designated X display (does not apply to all 
platforms). 

Appendix B
379
Batch mode
To process the same operations on a set of files, GIMP provides a command-line batch 
mode that works with the Script-Fu scripting language.  Using the -b parameter GIMP 
enters in interactive mode. Here's a simple script to apply the Unsharp Mask filter to a 
file and overwrite the original:
(define (simple-unsharp-mask filename
                             radius
                             amount
                             threshold)
  (let* ((image (car (gimp-file-load RUN-NONINTERACTIVE
                                     filename filename)))
          (drawable (car (gimp-image-get-active-layer image))))
    (plug-in-unsharp-mask RUN-NONINTERACTIVE
                          image drawable radius amount threshold)
     (gimp-file-save RUN-NONINTERACTIVE
                     image drawable filename filename)
     (gimp-image-delete image)))
Select the file with a .scm extension inside the ~/.gimp-2.6/scripts directory and call it 
with the following parameters:
gimp -i -b '(simple-unsharp-mask "foo.png" 5.0 0.5 0)' -b '(gimp-quit 
0)'
foo.png is the file to which you want to apply the Unsharp Mask filter. There are a few 
numeric parameters that are specific for the filter after the file name.
Adding tablet support to GIMP
Graphic tablets are an essential part of any professional's arsenal when working with graphics 
in a computer. They allow the user to draw and paint in a similar way people draw and paint 
with a pencil, a pen, or a brush.
Lots of beautiful, professional-looking pieces of artwork can be created with just a mouse, 
but only with the use of a tablet is the full capacity of a software like GIMP unleashed.

Release Changes
380
The installation of the tablet driver in the operating system or your windows manager goes 
beyond this book, but once you have it working, this is how to tell GIMP to use a graphic tablet:
Edit | Preferences | Input Devices | Configure Extended Input Devices 

Appendix B
381
A list should appear where you can select from several options:
This is just an example, pay attention to the following words:
f
f
stylus refers to the tip of the pen
f
f
pad refers to the buttons and sliders on the tablet
f
f
cursor refers to the mouse that sometimes comes with the tablet
f
f
eraser refers to the back tip of the pen
A few other devices can appear but these four are the main ones that allow you to use your 
tablet with GIMP fully. Set all but the pad device to Screen mode. If you are using Windows, 
just set Preferences | Input Devices | Input Controllers to DirectX DirectInput in the Active 
column.
You should restart GIMP to be sure all settings are configured and your tablet is ready.

Release Changes
382
The windows and their arrangement
This is the default workspace when you open the GIMP for the first time:
The window on the left is named the Toolbox window, where all the main tools can be quickly 
selected, (you should also learn their shortcuts!). Below the toolbox are the Tool Options. This 
is where you can find all the options for the currently selected tool.
When started, GIMP has the brush as the default selected tool, along with a 
color and a pattern, but you can keep the ones you had when quitting your 
last session by clicking on Save input device settings on exit inside the 
Preferences | Input Devices menu.

Appendix B
383
On the right side of the screen, you can see the Layers, Channels, and Path window. The 
Layers tab is one of the most important accessories, because it's where you can view the 
structure of the image while you are working on it. Below it you can see the Brush, Patterns, 
Gradients window. On the center of the screen is the Image window. Each image you open or 
create is shown on a separate image window; it also holds the main Menu. You can access 
it by right-clicking it as well. The image window holds a series of components with which you 
should familiarize yourself:
This is the default layout that you get when you open GIMP; there are many other windows, 
but most of them can be opened and closed as you need them.

Release Changes
384
Getting started with the tools
You can find all the main tools inside the Toolbox:
It's divided in two sections, the top part is where all the different tool icons are located. 
Clicking on a tool icon will select the tool. Also, if you hover with your mouse over a tool, and 
hold it there for just a moment, a tooltip will appear showing the tool name with its hotkey:
Using hotkeys is a great way to change tools without moving the cursor from 
the image window.

Appendix B
385
To open a file quickly, just drag it into the Toolbox window, but be careful! If you drag a file 
inside an image window, it gets loaded inside the already opened file. Don't be afraid, this is a 
just a minor error, and GIMP has wonderful undo and history capabilities; just keep reading!
Using Undo
The undo operation can be applied almost to anything in GIMP. You can access it by clicking 
Edit | Undo, or by it's hotkey Ctrl + Z. If you want to restore the last operation after undoing it, 
just hit Ctrl + Y or Edit | Redo to redo it.   There is a way to keep track of what were the last 
operations applied to an image. Just look at the Undo History dialog. Keep in mind that this 
history is not saved when you save your image to disk. The length of the Undo History can be 
changed inside the Edit | Preferences | Environment window:
Check the Minimal number of undo levels and the Maximum undo memory options. The 
first one sets how many undo levels GIMP will maintain, regardless of how much memory they 
consume. The second option sets the maximum amount of memory GIMP will use for the 
undo before it starts deleting the oldest undo operations.

Release Changes
386
There are a few things that cannot be undone:
f
f
Closing the image.
f
f
Reloading the image from the file.
f
f
Complex manipulations. For example, working with the Intelligent Scissors tool 
means you have to create a path and create a selection. Clicking undo will not get 
you back to the path creation, only to the starting point.
f
f
Filters and plugins can be undone, but that depends on how each operation they 
perform is implemented. If it's not, that can corrupt your undo history, deleting not 
only the last but all the history. That can also happen if you cancel a plugin/filter 
operation before it's done. The filters and plugins that come with GIMP are fully 
tested, but you should check the documentation of any filter or plugin you get 
from anywhere else to avoid running into any kind of problem while working.

About Packt Publishing
Packt, pronounced 'packed', published its first book "Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective MySQL 
Management" in April 2004 and subsequently continued to specialize in publishing highly focused 
books on specific technologies and solutions.
Our books and publications share the experiences of your fellow IT professionals in adapting and 
customizing today's systems, applications, and frameworks. Our solution based books give you the 
knowledge and power to customize the software and technologies you're using to get the job done. 
Packt books are more specific and less general than the IT books you have seen in the past. Our 
unique business model allows us to bring you more focused information, giving you more of what 
you need to know, and less of what you don't.
Packt is a modern, yet unique publishing company, which focuses on producing quality, cutting-
edge books for communities of developers, administrators, and newbies alike. For more 
information, please visit our website: www.packtpub.com.
About Packt Open Source
In 2010, Packt launched two new brands, Packt Open Source and Packt Enterprise, in order to 
continue its focus on specialization. This book is part of the Packt Open Source brand, home 
to books published on software built around Open Source licences, and offering information to 
anybody from advanced developers to budding web designers. The Open Source brand also runs 
Packt's Open Source Royalty Scheme, by which Packt gives a royalty to each Open Source project 
about whose software a book is sold.
Writing for Packt
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals should 
be sent to author@packtpub.com. If your book idea is still at an early stage and you would like to 
discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, contact us; one of our commissioning editors 
will get in touch with you. 
We're not just looking for published authors; if you have strong technical skills but no writing 
experience, our experienced editors can help you develop a writing career, or simply get some 
additional reward for your expertise.
