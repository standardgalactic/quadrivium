FOREWORD 
Target dates for compliance with the PCI DSS 
have all long since passed, and the Standard is 
now on its third version. Many organisations 
around the world – particularly those that fall 
below the top tier of payment card transaction 
volumes – are not yet compliant.  
There are perhaps three reasons for this.  
The first is that, outside a few US States, the PCI 
DSS has no legal status: it is not a law and does 
not have the force of law. Enforcement can only 
be carried out by contractual means, in a 
competitive payment card marketplace. The UK’s 
Information Commissioner, however, has said that 
compliance with the PCI DSS shows due diligence 
in protecting cardholder data, and has effectively 
imposed it as law through the threat of fines for 
failure to comply.1 
The second is that enforcement is driven by the 
card payment brands, through the banks that have 
the commercial relationships with the merchants 
that are supposed to comply. While enforcement 
has become more rigorous over the last three 
years, it is still inconsistent. 
The third is that the PCI DSS is extremely 
prescriptive, 
and 
takes 
a 
determined  
one-size-fits-all approach to information security 
requirements. Compliance is therefore seen as both 
expensive and bureaucratic.

Foreword 
7 
It is not surprising, therefore, that merchants have 
tried to avoid compliance with this Standard. This 
is a short-sighted and high-risk stance to adopt – 
rather like assuming that your business has no 
exposure to acts of nature or IT failure and does 
not, therefore, require a business or IT service 
continuity plan.  
All businesses that accept payment cards are prey 
for hackers and criminal gangs that seek to steal 
payment card and individual identity details. Many 
attacks are highly automated, seeking out website 
and payment card system vulnerabilities remotely, 
using 
increasingly 
sophisticated 
tools 
and 
techniques. When a vulnerability is discovered, an 
attack can start – without the management or staff 
of the target company having any awareness of 
what is going on.  
When the attack is exposed – most breaches go 
undetected for months, and are often found by 
third parties, such as payment brands conducting 
fraud checks – the target company will be exposed 
to a harsh and expensive set of repercussions. 
These will range from customer desertion and 
brand damage to significant penalties and 
operating requirements imposed by their acquiring 
bank, which will include a future level of 
monitoring at a level normally applicable to only 
the very largest of merchants. Penalties can also 
include expensive forensic investigation by 
accredited PCI Forensic Investigators (PFI); they 
could also be made designated entities by the 
payment brands or the acquirers, requiring an 
additional level of validation to prove compliance 
in the future.

Foreword 
8 
The PCI DSS is designed to ensure that merchants 
are protecting cardholder data effectively. It 
recognises that not all merchants have the 
technical understanding to identify the necessary 
steps and short circuits to avoid danger. All 
merchants and their service providers should 
therefore ensure that they comply with the PCI 
DSS, and that they stay compliant. If the solution 
cannot be found internally or through the service 
provider, then training and consultancy is the 
solution. 
Apart from anything else, if every merchant  
cooperates in the fight against the theft of 
cardholder data, we might make it easier in the 
long run for all our payment card customers.

CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS THE PAYMENT 
CARD INDUSTRY DATA SECURITY 
STANDARD (PCI DSS)? 
The Payment Card Industry Data Security 
Standard (PCI DSS) was developed by the five 
founding payment brands of the PCI Security 
Standards 
Council 
(PCI 
SSC, 
at 
www.pcisecuritystandards.org): 
American 
Express, 
Discover 
Financial 
Services, 
JCB 
International, MasterCard Worldwide and Visa. 
The PCI DSS consists of a standardised, industry-
wide set of requirements and processes for security 
management, 
policies, 
procedures, 
network 
architecture, 
software 
design 
and 
critical 
protective measures. 
The PCI DSS must be met by all organisations 
(merchants and service providers) that transmit, 
process or store payment card data, or directly or 
indirectly affect the security of cardholder data. If 
an organisation uses a third party to manage 
cardholder 
data, 
the 
organisation 
has 
a 
responsibility to ensure that this third party is 
compliant with the PCI DSS.  
The PCI DSS (sometimes referred to as a 
compliance standard) is not a law. It is a 
contractual obligation applied and enforced – by 
means of fines or other restrictions – directly by 
the payment providers themselves.

1: What is the Payment Card Industry Data 
Security Standard (PCI DSS)? 
14 
The currently applicable version of the PCI DSS, 
since April 2016, is version 3.2; subject to licence, 
it can be freely downloaded1. It is published and 
controlled by the independent PCI SSC on behalf 
of its five founding members.  
In June 2015, the PCI SSC introduced the concept 
of ‘designated entities’ – high-risk entities – that 
can be prescribed a set of supplemental validation 
requirements to demonstrate ongoing security 
efforts to protect payments. 
The SSC also defines qualifications for Qualified 
Security Assessors (QSAs), Internal Security 
Assessors (ISA), PCI Forensic Investigators (PFI), 
PCI Professionals (PCIP), Qualified Integrators 
and Resellers (QIR), and Approved Scanning 
Vendors (ASVs). It trains, tests, certifies and runs 
quality 
assurance 
programmes 
for 
these 
certifications. 
The PCI DSS is a set of 12 requirements that are 
imposed on merchants and other related parties. 
These 12 requirements are described later in this 
pocket guide.

CHAPTER 2: WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF 
THE PCI DSS? 
The PCI DSS is applicable if you store, process or 
transmit cardholder data, or if you are responsible 
for third parties that store, process or transmit 
cardholder data. It also applies if you are involved 
with or can affect the security of the storage, 
processing or transmission of cardholder data. The 
cardholder data environment (CDE) is any 
network that possesses cardholder data or sensitive 
authentication data. It does not apply to your 
organisation if primary account numbers (PANs) – 
the up-to-19-digit credit card numbers – are not 
stored, processed or transmitted. The PCI DSS 
applies to any type of media on which card data 
may be held – this includes not only hard disk 
drives, floppy disks, magnetic tape and back-up 
media, but also embraces printed or handwritten 
credit and debit card receipts where the full card 
number is printed. These receipts are sometimes 
held by merchants as a paper record of the 
transaction and may be used for voucher recovery 
purposes or as evidence of the transaction if the 
acquirer issues a request for information (RFI). If 
the card number is recorded in full, then the record 
is subject to the same security requirements as 
electronic copies, and therefore the receipts must 
be stored securely. 
Retailers must also secure all other areas where 
card details may be stored, processed or 
transmitted. EPOS systems are worthy of 
particular note. While newer EPOS systems store 
card details securely, many older EPOS systems 
www.ebook3000.com

2: What is the Scope of the PCI DSS? 
18 
do not. If the equipment does not store it securely, 
or there is uncertainty about whether it is secure, 
then retailers should take firmer measures to 
protect the equipment, or upgrade to equipment 
that meets PCI DSS standards. 
The PCI DSS applies to all processes, people and 
technology, and all system components, including 
network components, servers, or applications that 
are included in or connected to the CDE, and those 
that can affect the security of the cardholder data. 
It also applies to telephone recording technology 
used by call centres that accept payment card 
transactions. 
Shopping 
carts 
and 
payment 
processing facilities are examples of applications 
to which the PCI DSS applies (also see Chapter 12 
on the Payment Application Data Security 
Standard (PA-DSS). 
While not a specific requirement, the PCI DSS 
strongly recommends that any merchant or service 
provider reduces the scope of its CDE. This 
reduces the cost and complexity of both the initial 
assessment and the maintenance of PCI controls. 
Reducing the scope is typically achieved by 
isolating (network segmenting) the CDE. Given 
the complexity of modern IT networks and 
applications, we advise that you seek the advice of 
a qualified PCI DSS consultant prior to completing 
this activity. 

 
19 
CHAPTER 3: COMPLIANCE AND 
COMPLIANCE PROGRAMMES 
Payment brands enforce the compliance process 
through contractual means, including higher 
processing fees, fines and financial penalties for 
non-compliance.  These penalties can be applied 
monthly during the remediation process, and 
additional fines can be levied for breaches. 
‘What are the consequences to my business if I 
do not comply with the PCI DSS?’ 
‘The PCI Security Standards Council encourages 
all businesses that store payment account data to 
comply with the PCI DSS to help lower their 
brand and financial risks associated with account 
payment data compromises. The PCI Security 
Standards Council does not manage compliance 
programmes 
and 
does 
not 
impose 
any 
consequences for non-compliance. Individual 
payment brands, however, may have their own 
compliance initiatives, including financial or 
operational consequences to certain businesses that 
are not compliant.’1 
This all means that each payment provider will 
take whatever action it thinks it can make stick, 
commercially, to enforce the PCI DSS. There are 
no standardised penalties across all the payment 
brands, and the PCI SSC has no plans to create

3: Compliance and Compliance Programmes 
20 
any. Individual payment brands have their own 
compliance initiatives, and will require separate 
evidence of compliance. Given that the original 
dates for compliance have now all passed, each 
brand is likely to set different dates for different 
levels and different entities to demonstrate 
compliance. The acquiring bank is usually the best 
channel through which to discuss compliance 
deadlines and penalties, which are all imposed by 
means of the payment brand/acquiring bank’s 
contract with the merchant. 
While the PCI DSS is a common standard, each 
payment 
brand 
has 
its 
own 
compliance 
programme. Note that there may be regional 
variations for VISA (e.g. USA and Europe), while 
MasterCard has a single global standard, and that 
acquiring banks – not the payment brands – are 
usually responsible for enforcement. All detailed 
compliance enquiries should therefore be directed 
to your acquiring bank. Detailed below are the 
websites for the PCI DSS compliance programmes 
for each of the five founding members of the PCI 
SSC, which will give some guidance on the 
compliance actions that might be expected in 
respect of each of the payment brands:

CHAPTER 4: CONSEQUENCES OF A 
BREACH 
The consequences of a data security breach are 
likely to be proportionate to the seriousness of the 
breach and the extent to which the merchant or 
service provider is able to demonstrate prior 
compliance with the PCI DSS. For level one 
merchants, the combination of fines, litigation and 
brand damage is significant; for non-level one 
merchants, the consequences of a breach are 
potentially as serious, and include: 
• 
A significant cost for a forensic 
investigation. 
• 
The merchant automatically becoming a 
level one merchant (i.e. yearly on-site 
audits). 
• 
A possible charge by issuer(s) to acquirer(s) 
for card reissue, which may be passed on to 
the merchant. 
• 
The merchant may lose its ability to accept 
payment cards. 
• 
Transaction costs may be increased. 
• 
Service providers may be removed from 
listings by the payment brands. 
• 
Merchants or service providers may become 
designated entities and subject to additional 
validation requirements. 
 

 
23 
CHAPTER 5: HOW DO YOU COMPLY 
WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE 
STANDARD? 
All organisations must comply. There are two 
options for demonstrating compliance: an annual 
on-site security audit and the submission of four 
passing quarterly network scans by an ASV, or 
completion of a Self-Assessment Questionnaire, in 
all cases together with a submission of four 
passing quarterly network scans. Which option 
applies to any one organisation is determined by 
transaction volume and whether or not there has 
previously been a security breach. 
The major global payment brands require that 
every entity – including financial institutions, 
merchants and service providers – that stores, 
processes, or transmits payment card data, in every 
channel – including catalogue and online retailers, 
as well as bricks-and-mortar businesses – must be 
in compliance with the PCI DSS. 
Merchant PCI DSS compliance criteria 
Compliance requirements are dependent on a 
merchant’s activity level. There are four levels, 
based on the annual number of credit/debit card 
transactions. While payment brands determine the 
compliance levels for their own brands, acquirers 
are usually responsible for determining the 
compliance validation requirement levels of their 
merchants. The compliance levels are based on the 
following table and usually refer to the number of 
transactions of each payment brand in a year. 
www.ebook3000.com

5: How do you Comply with the Requirements of 
the Standard? 
24 
Whether or not transaction volume applies only to 
e-commerce transactions or to payments processed 
through all channels is decided separately by each 
payment brand but, in general, all transactions are 
included. 
Table 1: Merchant PCI DSS compliance levels 
Level one criteria: 
American Express 
2.5 million American Express card transactions or 
more per year.  
Any merchant that has had a data incident.  
Any merchant that American Express otherwise 
deems a Level 1. 
Visa 
Merchants processing more than six million Visa 
transactions per year via all channels. 
Global merchants identified as level one by any 
Visa region. 
MasterCard 
Any merchant having more than six million total 
combined MasterCard and Maestro transactions 
per year. 
Any merchant that has suffered a hack or an attack 
that resulted in an account data compromise. 
Any merchant meeting Visa’s Level 1 criteria. 

5: How do you Comply with the Requirements of 
the Standard? 
25 
Any merchant that MasterCard determines should 
meet the Level 1 merchant requirements to 
minimise risk to the system. 
Discover 
All merchants processing more than six million 
card transactions per year on the Discover 
network.  
Any merchant that Discover determines should 
meet the Level 1 compliance validation and 
reporting requirements. 
All merchants required by another payment brand 
or acquirer to validate and report their compliance 
as a Level 1 merchant. 
JCB 
One million JCB transactions or more per year. 
Level one validation requirements: 
Annual on-site audit by a Qualified Security 
Assessor (QSA) or an Internal Security Assessor 
(ISA), passing Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) 
scans and a Report on Compliance (RoC). 
Level two criteria: 
American Express 
50,000 to 2.5 million American Express card 
transactions per year. 
Visa/MasterCard/Discover 
Merchants processing one million to six million 
www.ebook3000.com

5: How do you Comply with the Requirements of 
the Standard? 
26 
transactions per year, across all of the brand’s 
channels. 
JCB 
Less than one million JCB transactions per year. 
Level two validation requirements: 
Annual Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), 
passing a quarterly scan by an ASV. 
In addition to passing quarterly network scans by 
an ASV, MasterCard requires either an annual  
on-site audit by a QSA at the merchant’s 
discretion, or an annual self-assessment by an ISA. 
Quarterly network scans by an ASV are only a 
requirement on some SAQ forms; check the 
requirements with the payment brand compliance 
programmes. 
Level three criteria: 
American Express 
Fewer than 50,000 American Express card 
transactions per year. 
Visa/MasterCard 
Merchants processing 20,000 to one million 
Visa/MasterCard e-commerce transactions per 
year, across all of the brand’s channels. 
Discover 
Merchants processing 20,000 to one million card-
not-present transactions per year on the Discover

27 
network. 
Level three validation requirements: 
Quarterly scan by an ASV. 
Annual SAQ. 
Level four criteria: 
American Express 
Called ‘Level EMV’; 50,000 or more AMEX 
transactions per year, with at least 75% made on 
an EMV-enabled terminal. 
Visa 
E-commerce merchants processing fewer than 
20,000 Visa e-commerce transactions annually.  
Non e-commerce merchants processing up to one 
million Visa transactions annually. 
MasterCard/Discover 
All other merchants – and the PCI Council is clear 
that PCI DSS compliance is required even if there 
is only one payment card transaction per year1. 
Level four validation requirements: 
Annual SAQ. 
Quarterly scan by an ASV (may be recommended

or required, depending on acquirer compliance 
criteria). 
Service provider PCI DSS compliance criteria 
A service provider is an organisation involved in 
the processing, storage and transmission of 
cardholder data, and/or protecting the security of 
cardholder data, but is not a merchant or a card 
brand member. Hosting providers and others 
providing services to merchants would also fall 
into this category. 
Service provider compliance requirements are 
defined by the payment brands. Visa, MasterCard 
and AMEX categorise service providers according 
to transaction volume and/or type of service 
provider. In comparison with the four levels of 
merchant compliance criteria, there are only two 
for service providers.

levels 
Level one criteria: 
American Express 
2.5 million American Express card transactions or 
more per year, or any other service provider that 
American Express otherwise deems a level 1 
service provider.

unlikely to be merchants or service providers that 
are not at the level 1 status. 

5: How do you Comply with the Requirements of 
the Standard? 
31 
Role of service providers 
Many service providers deliver payment services 
directly to merchants using a variety of online and 
physical technologies. These services include 
online payment gateways, traditional document 
processing facilities and shared hosting server and 
application providers. The PCI DSS asks that 
shared hosting providers ensure compliance with 
additional requirements that include protecting 
each merchant’s hosted individual CDE, ensuring 
the availability of audit trails and allowing forensic 
investigation if required. To achieve compliance 
with the PCI DSS, a merchant must ensure that 
any service provider it uses must be PCI DSS 
compliant. 
Service providers who have an indirect connection 
with the storage, processing or transmission of 
cardholder data– such as an IT support company 
that manages the firewalls in the perimeter of the 
CDE and hence can affect the inbound and 
outbound traffic – are also required to be PCI DSS 
compliant. 
Service providers demonstrate their compliance 
with the PCI DSS with criteria as outlined in Table 
2.  The PCI DSS recommends that, in addition to 
achieving compliance with the requirements of the 
Standard, service providers should also provide 
supporting evidence (via an AoC) to prove to 
merchants that they are compliant. Service 
providers and merchants must agree in writing 
which aspects of the PCI DSS requirements the 
service provider is responsible for ensuring 
compliance with and which the merchant is

5: How do you Comply with the Requirements of 
the Standard? 
32 
responsible for. Merchants must maintain a list of 
service providers and the compliant services they 
provide. 
Online payment gateways 
For merchants that sell their products or services 
online, we strongly recommend the use of a third-
party payment gateway service which is fully PCI 
compliant. These services are available from 
PayPal, Sage Pay, WorldPay, HSBC Secure 
ePayments and Barclays ePDQ. For the smaller  
e-commerce business, outsourcing to a payment 
gateway service provides a cost-effective way of 
ensuring PCI compliance.  
Please note that such a merchant (likely to be 
Level 3 or 4) will be required to complete the 
relevant Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) 
and submit the results of a quarterly scan by an 
Approved Scanning Vendor. The SAQ document 
required will either be SAQ A for those who have 
a fully outsourced e-commerce platform, SAQ A-
EP for those who use only partially outsourced e-
commerce platforms, or SAQ C-VT, which applies 
to merchants that use web-based virtual terminals 
to manually enter payment card information. See 
Chapter 9, Table 3 for further information. 
 

 
33 
CHAPTER 6: MAINTAINING 
COMPLIANCE 
Once an organisation has achieved compliance 
with the PCI DSS, it must maintain its level of 
compliance. This, of course, means making 
oneself aware of any changes to the PCI DSS itself 
(the latest version was released in April 2016), as 
well as maintaining the PCI DSS security 
environment.  
The PCI SSC makes the point this way: 
technically, it is true that, if you’ve completed a 
Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), you’re 
compliant – ‘for that particular moment in time 
when the Self-Assessment Questionnaire and 
associated vulnerability scan (if applicable) is 
completed. After that moment, only a post-breach 
forensic analysis can prove PCI compliance. But a 
bad system change can make you non-compliant in 
an instant. True security of cardholder data 
requires non-stop assessment and remediation to 
ensure that likelihood of a breach is kept as low as 
possible.’1 
Version 3.2 of the PCI DSS now incorporates the 
requirements for designated entities supplemental 
validation (DESV) as an appendix in the Standard 
called 
Appendix 
A3. 
Although 
the 
DESV/Appendix A3 is for those entities that have

been designated, the PCI SSC recommends2 that 
the controls can be used to complement any 
entity’s PCI DSS compliance efforts, and all 
entities are encouraged to follow them as a best 
practice, even if they are not required to validate.

CHAPTER 7: PCI DSS – THE STANDARD 
The PCI DSS has 12 requirements, organised into 
six control objectives. Please note that this pocket 
guide is no substitute for obtaining your own copy 
of the Standard, which is freely downloadable 
from 
www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/
documents.php.  
PCI DSS version 1.0 was originally published in 
January 2005, with subsequent updates to version 
1.1 in September 2006 and version 1.2 in October 
2008. PCI DSS v2.0 was released on 28 October 
2010, and v3.0 was published on 7 November 
2013. The most recent version, v3.2, was released 
in April 2016. 
With the release of PCI DSS v2.0, the PCI 
Security Standards Council introduced a new 
three-year lifecycle for standards development.  
This ensures a gradual and phased introduction of 
new versions, and helps to prevent organisations 
from becoming non-compliant when a new 
Standard is published. Since version 3.2, however, 
the PCI Security Standards Council has abandoned 
the three-year cycle in favour of more frequent 
incremental updates to help the Standard keep up 
with a faster pace of change within the security 
industry. 
Version 3.0 of the PCI DSS introduces more 
flexibility in implementing the requirements, and 
increases the focus on education, awareness and 
security as a shared responsibility. 
www.ebook3000.com

7: PCI DSS – The Standard 
36 
Version 3.1 of the PCI DSS is an out-of-band 
update created in response to the repeated 
vulnerabilities discovered in the SSL security 
protocol throughout early 2015. It removes SSL 
and early versions of TLS as secure technologies, 
and dictates that they are replaced with TLS 1.2 
and beyond, or IPsec. 
Version 3.2 of the PCI DSS is a new incremental 
update 
introducing 
business-as-usual 
(BAU) 
requirements. 
Organisations 
have 
typically 
focused on the annual assessment rather than 
continually managing their compliance state. 
Compliance is often only at its peak following the 
annual assessment and this trails off over time. 
Service providers have been targeted by adding 
guidance for maintaining card security as part of 
their business-as-usual activities. 
 
Appendix A3 has been added to state the 
requirements for designated entities, and Appendix 
A2 has been added to provide clear guidance on 
transitioning from using SSL and early TLS, with 
extended timescales provided for transitions 
supported by formal risk assessments and 
mitigation plans.  
The six control objectives and 12 PCI DSS 
requirements that address these are as follows: 
Build and maintain a secure network and 
systems 
Requirement 1: Install and maintain a firewall 
configuration to protect cardholder data. 

7: PCI DSS – The Standard 
37 
Requirement 2: Do not use vendor-supplied 
defaults for system passwords and other security 
parameters. 
Protect cardholder data 
Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data. 
Requirement 4: Encrypt transmission of 
cardholder data across open, public networks. 
Maintain a vulnerability management 
programme 
Requirement 5: Protect all systems against 
malware and regularly update anti-virus software 
or programs. 
Requirement 6: Develop and maintain secure 
systems and applications. 
Implement strong access control measures 
Requirement 7: Restrict access to cardholder data 
by business need-to-know. 
Requirement 8: Identify and authenticate access 
to system components. 
Requirement 9: Restrict physical access to 
cardholder data. 
Regularly monitor and test networks 
Requirement 10: Track and monitor all access to 
network resources and cardholder data.

CHAPTER 9: THE PCI SELF-ASSESSMENT 
QUESTIONNAIRE (SAQ) 
The PCI DSS Self-Assessment Questionnaire is a 
validation tool developed by the PCI SSC to assist 
merchants 
and 
service 
providers 
in  
self-evaluating their compliance with the PCI 
DSS. 
All merchants and their service providers are 
required to comply with the PCI DSS in its 
entirety 
and, 
if 
they 
are 
eligible 
for  
self-assessment, to attest that they comply by 
using the standard Attestation of Compliance 
(AoC) 
document. 
New 
Self-Assessment 
Questionnaires and Attestations of Compliance 
were released in 2016 to meet the requirements of 
version 3.2 of the PCI DSS.  
In the last versions of the questionnaire, there were 
nine validation categories (see Table 3), each of 
which 
can 
be 
downloaded 
from:  
www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library.

CHAPTER 10: PROCEDURES AND 
QUALIFICATIONS 
The PCI SSC mandates the procedures that must 
be followed in conducting audits and in carrying 
out scanning procedures. It also lays down specific 
requirements for qualification as a QSA or an 
ASV.

To be recognised as a QSA by the PCI SSC, QSAs 
must meet or exceed the requirements described in 
the above document and must also execute the 
QSA Agreement in Appendix A with the PCI 
Council. Clients can provide feedback on the 
effectiveness of the QSA.

CHAPTER 11: THE PCI DSS AND ISO/IEC 
27001 
ISO/IEC 27001 is the international information 
security management standard that more and more 
organisations are using to ensure that their 
information security management meets the data 
protection and compliance requirements of a wide 
variety 
of 
legislation, 
including 
EU 
Data 
Protection Acts and Privacy Directives, HIPAA, 
the GLBA and others. 
While the PCI DSS was not written to map 
specifically to ISO 27001 or to any other existing 
framework, it sits clearly within the ISO 27001 
framework, 
and 
organisations 
that 
have 
implemented an ISO 27001 information security 
management system (ISMS) should be able, with 
minor additional work, to also demonstrate their 
conformance with the PCI DSS. The individual 
controls set out in detail inside the PCI DSS can be 
mapped to the controls and clauses of ISO 27001 
(primarily to Annex A, the list of information 
security controls). 
It certainly makes sense for any organisation that 
is pursuing either ISO 27001 or PCI DSS 
compliance, and has both payment card data and 
other 
confidential 
data 
(whether 
personally 
identifiable information – sometimes known as 
‘PID’) or other commercial information to protect, 
to tackle the requirements of the PCI DSS from 
within the ISO 27001 framework.

CHAPTER 12: THE PAYMENT 
APPLICATION DATA SECURITY 
STANDARD (PA-DSS) 
The PA-DSS is the PCI SSC-managed programme 
that focuses on payment applications, such as 
shopping carts, payment gateways, and so on. This 
programme was previously run by Visa Inc. and 
was known as Payment Application Best Practices 
(PABP). Increasingly, criminals are targeting 
vulnerabilities in payment applications to steal 
payment card data, and some users may 
unknowingly have sensitive card data stored on 
their systems by software. The PA-DSS is 
therefore meant to help software vendors and 
others develop secure payment applications that do 
not store prohibited data, such as full magnetic 
stripes, CVV2 or PIN data, and to ensure their 
payment applications support compliance with the 
PCI DSS. 
Commercial 
off-the-shelf 
(COTS) 
payment 
applications that are sold, distributed or licensed to 
third 
parties 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
PA-DSS 
requirements. In-house or bespoke payment 
applications that are developed by merchants or 
service providers and which are not sold to a third 
party are not subject to the PA-DSS requirements, 
but must still comply with the PCI DSS. 

12: Payment Application Data Security Standard 
(PA-DSS) 
59 
The PA-DSS has its own security audit procedures 
and its own detailed programme guide1 that help 
organisations to determine exactly how these 
compliance requirements affect them. The PCI 
SSC also publishes and maintains a list of 
Validated Payment Applications2 that have been 
assessed as having met the requirements of the 
Standard. As this list is continually updated, we 
recommend that merchants contact the respective 
software vendors to confirm that their applications 
are fully compliant with the latest version of the 
PA-DSS. 
As mentioned in Chapter 5, we strongly 
recommend the use of a third-party payment 
gateway service which is fully PCI compliant, 
particularly for the requirements of a small  
e-commerce business. While such a service 
provider is not obliged to use an in-house software 
application that is compliant with the PA-DSS, we 
advise that merchants use the larger suppliers who 
are fully compliant with the PA-DSS and the PCI 
DSS.

CHAPTER 13: PIN TRANSACTION 
SECURITY (PTS) 
The PCI SSC also has compliance requirements 
for 
PIN 
entry 
(PIN 
pad 
and  
point-of-sale) devices that are used in conjunction 
with payment cards in environments attended by a 
cashier, merchant or sales clerk, or those that are 
unattended, such as garage forecourts. There is a 
testing and approval guide,1 together with detailed 
vendor guidance on how to gain approval. All of 
this 
information 
is 
available 
at 
www.pcisecuritystandards.org/assessors_and_solu
tions/pin_transaction_devices.  
The PIN Security Requirements  contains a 
complete set of requirements for the secure 
management, processing and  transmission of 
personal identification number (PIN) data during 
online and offline payment card transaction 
processing at ATMs, and attended and unattended 
point-of-sale (POS) terminals. 
The PIN Transaction Security programme includes 
unattended 
payment 
terminals 
(UPTs) 
and 
hardware security modules (HSMs), so that these 
devices can be rigorously tested to ensure they 
secure cardholder data in a payment process. UPTs 
include  
self-service ticketing machines, kiosks, automated

fuel pumps and vending machines. HSMs are 
secure cryptographic devices that can be used for 
PIN translation, card personalisation, electronic 
commerce or data protection and do not include 
any type of cardholder interface. The PCI SSC 
maintains a list of approved UPTs and HSMs.
