Dedication
This book is dedicated to my wife of more than 25 years, the 
lovely Lisa, who taught me almost everything I know about 
almost everything I know that’s not made by Apple, Inc. And to 
my children, Allison and Jacob, who love their iPhones almost 
as much as I love them (the kids, not their iPhones).

Introduction
Let me get one thing out of the way right from the get-go. I think you’re 
pretty darn smart for buying a For Dummies book. That says to me 
that you have the confidence and intelligence to know what you don’t 
know. The For Dummies franchise is built around the core notion that 
all of us feel insecure about certain topics when tackling them for the 
first time, especially when those topics have to do with technology.
And speaking of “Dummies,” remember that it’s just a word. I don’t 
think you’re dumb — quite the opposite! And, for what it’s worth, I 
asked if we could leave “Dummies” out of the title and call it some-
thing like, Incredible iPhone Apps For People Smart Enough to Know 
They Couldn’t Possibly Evaluate Thousands of iPhone Apps and Live to 
Tell About It. My editors just laughed. “C’mon, that’s the whole point of 
the name!” they insisted. “And besides, it’s shorter our way.”
Sigh.
About This Book
This, my 55th technical book, was almost certainly the hardest book 
I’ve had to write. Yet I think I had more fun writing it than any of the 
others. Here’s why. . . .
More than 100,000 apps are available in the iTunes App Store today, 
with thousands more added each week. No single human (or even a 
rather large team of humans) could look at them all, much less give 
every one of them a thorough workout.
So my first challenge was to narrow the field to a manageable size. I 
began by looking for apps that had achieved some measure of acclaim, 
a combination of iTunes Store ranking, positive buzz on the Web, 
iTunes Store reviews, the opinions of friends and colleagues who 
matter (you know who you are), the opinions of my family, the opin-
ions of the many enthusiastic iPhone fans at Wiley Publishing, reviews 
in print, and reviews on the Web. Then I added the thousands of dol-
lars’ worth of apps already in my personal collection. When all was 
said and done, I had way more than 600 apps that were contenders, 
and I spent several months testing them, taking notes, and capturing 
screen shots.

My next challenge was figuring out how many categories (chapters) 
should be included and which ones they should be. This was almost as 
hard as determining the 600+ contenders. But after much deliberation 
and consideration, I decided that there would be 16 incredible apps 
chapters plus 3 bonus “top ten” chapters.
Deciding on the number of apps that would appear in each chapter 
was easier: I suggested ten and nobody argued, so that was that.
Selecting the 160 most incredible apps (16 chapters × 10 apps) was 
incredibly difficult, as was deciding where each app belonged. Many 
apps could just as easily fit in one chapter as another. The Dictionary! 
app, for example, would be equally at home in the Books, Education, 
or Reference chapter. So where does it go? The Rock Band app could 
appear in the Music chapter or the Games chapter. Which 
is more appropriate? Don’t even get me started on Business, Utility, 
and Productivity apps. It was impossible, so in the end, I just went 
with my heart.
So if you think I put an app in the wrong chapter, just know that I did 
the best I could at an impossible task and take some pity on me.
How This Book Is Organized
While we’re on the subject of chapters, here’s something I imagine 
you’ve never heard before: Most books have a beginning, a middle, 
and an end. Generally, you do well to adhere to that linear structure — 
unless you’re one of those knuckleheads out to ruin it for the rest of us 
by jumping ahead and revealing that the butler did it.
Fortunately, there is no ending to spoil in a For Dummies book. So 
although you may want to digest this book from start to finish — and 
I hope you do — I won’t penalize you for skipping ahead or jump-
ing around. Having said that, I organized Incredible iPhone Apps For 
Dummies and the contents of each chapter in the order I think makes 
the most sense — alphabetical.
So the 16 chapters are organized from A to Z: Books; Business; 
Education; Entertainment; Finance, Food Cooking and Nutrition; 
Games; Healthcare and Fitness; Music; Photography; Productivity; 
Reference; Social Networking; Sports; Travel, Navigation, and Weather; 
and Utilities.

Introduction

Each chapter in the book contains five apps, listed alphabetically, 
each getting two full pages of description and pictures. These five 
apps are followed by five more apps, also alphabetized, with shorter 
descriptions. The five apps with the longer descriptions and pictures 
were selected only because I felt those were the apps that would 
benefit most from longer descriptions and pictures. The five apps 
with shorter descriptions and no pictures were the ones I felt I could 
describe adequately in a paragraph or two.
Please understand that the apps are not ranked in any way within 
the chapter. Ranking the apps #1 through #10 was more than I could 
bear; just think of the ten apps in each chapter as more or less equally 
incredible.
Last, but not least, you’ll find three chapters at the end with top-ten 
lists styled after the chapters found in “The Part of Tens” in a regular 
For Dummies book  — think of it as the For Dummies answer to David 
Letterman. The lists presented in Chapters 17 and 18 steer you to my 
favorite free and paid iPhone apps. If you read this book from cover 
to cover, you’ll already know about the apps I discuss in Chapters 17 
and 18 — because they are, after all, my favorites. But I try not to 
repeat myself. Instead, I explain why each app made the cut and offer 
some tips or discuss some additional features of each app. The final 
top-ten list, in Chapter 19, offers my suggestions for some essential 
iPhone peripherals and accessories you might want to consider 
adding to your phone. 
Conventions Used in This Book
First, I want to tell you how I go about my business. Incredible iPhone 
Apps For Dummies makes generous use of bullet lists and pictures. 
And all Web and e-mail addresses are shown in a special monofont 
typeface, like this.
There are no links to the App Store because they’re long and easy to 
mistype. Rather, we took great pains to ensure that all app names are 
properly spelled, so you should have no trouble finding them using 
the App Store’s search engine.
I’ve listed prices for each app, and these prices were accurate at the 
time this book was printed. That said, developers change App prices 
regularly, so the price you see in the book may not be the same as 
 Introduction

the price you see in the App Store. Rest assured, it was right when 
this book went to press and if it’s not right anymore, please blame (or 
thank) the developer.
Another thing: I use iPhone throughout the book, but in most cases 
what I really mean is iPhone and iPod touch. Almost all iPhone apps 
also run on the iPod touch, but I didn’t want to have to type the longer 
form thousands of times. So when you see the word iPhone, replace it 
in your mind with iPhone and iPod touch.
Icons Used in This Book
Little round pictures (icons) appear in the left margins throughout 
this book. Consider these icons miniature road signs, telling you some-
thing extra about the topic at hand or hammering a point home.
Here’s what the three icons used in this book look like and mean.
 
These are the juicy morsels, shortcuts, and recommendations that 
might make the task at hand faster or easier.
 
This icon emphasizes the stuff I think you ought to retain. You may 
even jot down a note to yourself in the iPhone.
 
You wouldn’t intentionally run a stop sign, would you? In the same 
fashion, ignoring warnings may be hazardous to your iPhone and (by 
extension) your wallet. There, you now know how these warning icons 
work: You have just received your very first warning!
A Note about Project Gutenberg
Most books published in the United States prior to 1923 are considered 
to be in the public domain. This means they are free of copyright and that 
anyone can print them, distribute them electronically, or even charge 
money for them. Project Gutenberg (www.gutenberg.org) is the first 
and largest single collection of free electronic books (e-books) on the Web 
today with more than 30,000 free books. I mention Project Gutenberg and 
its plethora of titles several times in these pages. Now you know what I’m 
referring to.

Where to Go from Here
Why straight to Chapter 1, of course (without passing Go). But first, 
there is one more thing.
 
I didn’t write this book for myself. I wrote it for you — and I would 
love to hear how it worked for you. So please send me your thoughts, 
platitudes, likes and dislikes, and any other comments. You can 
send snail-mail in care of Wiley, but it takes a long time to reach me 
that way, and I just don’t have time to respond to 99.9% of it. If you 
want a response, your best bet is to send e-mail to me directly at 
 incredibleiphoneapps@boblevitus.com. I appreciate your 
feedback, and I try to respond to all reasonably polite e-mail within 
a few days.
Last, but not least, let me make you an offer you can’t refuse: If you 
know of an app you think should appear in the next edition of this 
book, please send me an e-mail message explaining why you think 
so and the chapter you think it belongs in. If I like the app enough to 
include it in the next edition of this book, I’ll not only thank you in the 
acknowledgements section, I’ll also send you a free autographed copy 
of the book. You’ve got to love that!
Okay, that’s all I’ve got for now. Go — enjoy the book!

 Audiobook Player
 
 
$0.99 US
 My wife and I have always enjoyed listen-
ing to audiobooks in our cars. First we 
listened to cassette tapes; then we listened 
to CDs; and now we use our iPhones. Until 
recently, we spent $10 to $20 each month 
on audiobooks from Audible.com (www.
audible.com). Then we discovered the 
fantastic Audiobook Player app from Alex 
Sokirynsky. With Audiobook Player, we can 
easily  find, download, and listen to more 
than 2,300 free books.
Audiobook Player’s iTunes App Store 
description claims that it’s “the best way to 
enjoy streaming or offline playback of free 
audio books on the iPhone and iPod touch.” Audiobook Player is defi-
nitely the easiest way to find and download free audio books with its 
several ways to browse or search for titles that interest you, as shown 
in the figure on the left.
 
I’d be remiss, gentle reader, if I didn’t at least mention that Audiobook 
Player gets almost all of its content from Librivox (http://librivox.
org), a non-commercial, non-profit, ad-free project run by volunteers. 
Librivox donates all of its volunteer-made recordings to the public 
domain.
If you don’t want to pay 99¢ or you don’t care for this app, you can 
visit the Librivox Web site, download all the audiobooks you like, and 
import them into iTunes. Audiobook Player just makes it easier to find 
and manage your audiobook library because you can download new 
titles right to your iPhone so that you can listen to them immediately. 
Audiobook Player even breaks the files into chapters. 
Best features
One of the best things about Audiobook Player is that — unlike the 
audiobooks you purchase from Audible.com — you can download free 
audiobooks one chapter at a time, as shown in the figure on the right, 
which helps you conserve storage space on your iPhone.

Another nice feature of Audiobook Player is that you can download new 
titles or chapters over any of your iPhone’s three wireless networks — 
Wi-Fi, 3G, or EDGE.
Finally, there’s also a free version called Audiobook Player - FREE, 
which is the same as the paid version, but you’re limited to one book 
at a time. 
Worst features
Although the 2,300 free books include classics in the public domain, 
such as The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Aesop’s Fables, Beyond Good 
and Evil, The Count of Monte Cristo, The Curious Case of Benjamin 
Button, Pride and Prejudice, Robinson Crusoe, and A Tale of Two Cities, 
there are few (if any) audiobooks written during our lifetimes. This 
isn’t the app’s fault, but I still consider it a shortcoming. 
 
If you’re looking for current bestsellers or more contemporary fare, 
the iTunes Store’s Audiobook section has a pretty good selection. 
Keep in mind that the same audiobook you find in the iTunes store 
often costs less at www.audible.com. You might also check out the 
AudibleListener Gold plan. My wife and I pay just $14.95 per month for 
one audiobook a month, even if the audiobook’s list price is substan-
tially higher (as most of them are).

Classics2Go Collection
 
$0.99 US
Class ics2Go is  o ne of the myriad apps you’ll find in the App Store that 
offers a selection of books that are in the public domain. This one 
includes more than 50 classic books, is easy on the eyes, and offers a 
couple of unique features. Although I haven’t tried every classic book 
app in the iTunes Store, I’ve spent at least $20 on the ones that look 
the most promising. After much deliberation, I’ve concluded that the 
Classics2Go Collection is the one I like best. 
The Classic2Go library includes more than 50 classics such as The Illiad 
and The Odyssey, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Call of the Wild, 
Hound of the Baskervilles, Siddhartha, Dracula, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, 
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Frankenstein, and dozens more. 
One thing that makes this app unique is that several of the books — 
including Alice in Wonderland, A Christmas Carol, and Flatland — feature 
illustrations, as shown in the figure on the left.
Some apps that are similar to Classics2Go have poorly formatted text 
with strange line endings and weird page breaks, or they feature ugly 
typography in unattractive fonts. The books in Classics2Go Collection, 
though, are nicely formatted and typeset as shown in the figure on the 
right.
Best features
What I like best about Classics2Go Collection is the elegant typogra-
phy, thoughtful page layout, and clear, readable text. It’s obvious that 
the developers didn’t just copy and paste the raw Project Gutenberg 
text into the app (see the Introduction to this book for info on Project 
Gutenberg). The upshot is that text in this app looks better than the 
text in most of the other “reading” apps I’ve tested. 
Another plus is the quantity and quality of the available titles. You’ve 
got to love getting more than 50 of the world’s greatest books for less 
than a buck. Although some of these books are available in other clas-
sic book apps, the Classics2Go Collection  contains many more books 
that I’m likely to read and enjoy. 
A free version of the app is available. It’s called Classics2GoLite 
Collection and has the same features as the paid version but 
includes only six books: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Alice in 
8
Chapter 1: Books 

9
Wonderland, A Christmas Carol, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, 
Pride and Prejudice, and Romeo and Juliet. So before you plunk down 
the whopping 99¢ for Classics2 Go Collection, you can check out the 
interface to make sure you like it.
Worst features
The biggest problem I have with Classics2Go Collection is that 
you can’t select a different font size. I usually find myself wishing I 
could make text bigger on my iPhone, but in the case of Classics2Go 
Collection, I’d like to make it a little smaller so that I wouldn’t have to 
turn the page as often. Other than this small complaint, I’ve found that 
Classics2Go Collection provides a most pleasant reading experience 
with nice touches you won’t find in other apps. 
 
If you don’t want to pay for a public domain book collection, you can 
download from Project Gutenberg most (if not all) the books any of 
the similar apps offer. Save them as Microsoft Word, PDF, or plain text 
files, or send them to yourself in the body of an e-mail message (or 
messages) so that you can view them on your iPhone without 
purchasing additional software. 
 
Although downloading from Project Gutenberg may save you a buck 
or two, you’ll miss out on all the cool goodies Classics2Go (and similar 
apps) offers, such as bookmarks, optimized typography, tables of con-
tents, and illustrations.

 Comics
 
Free
The Comics app is a front-end to t h e largest comic book library online, 
offers a ton of free content, and provides a well-designed interface that 
makes viewing comics on a small screen more pleasant than other 
comic book reader apps.
Comics is actually three different apps rolled into one. First and 
foremost, it’s a fantastic way of reading comic books on a 3.5-inch 
touch screen. It’s also a comic book store with hundreds of individual 
comics from dozens of different publishers, including Arcana Comics, 
Devil’s Due, Digital Webbing, Red 5, Zenescope, and many others. Last 
but not least, it’s a great way to organize the comics you own on your 
iPhone so you can find the one you want quickly and easily. 
Let’s start with the viewer. Wired.com says Comics, “solves the problem 
of reading comics on the small screen,” and I have to agree. The comics 
are presented in Comixology’s patent-pending Guided View, which keeps 
the page intact as its creators intended. It “guides” you from panel to 
panel with beautiful transition animations, panning across frames and 
offering dramatic pull-backs that enhance the viewing experience, as 
shown in the figure on the left (which is from Atomic Robo #1, one of 
many free comics available through the Comics app’s built-in comic 
book store).
In all fairness, comic book purists like my friend Andy Ihnatko don’t 
much care for enhancements such as Guided View. In fact, he recently 
wrote an article for the Chicago Sun-Times in which he expressed his 
distain for such frippery: “Even when ‘motion comics’ are done with 
great expense and care (such as Marvel’s recent ‘Spider-Woman’ offer-
ing) the overall effect is sock-puppety at best.” 
Some people say opinions are like noses (or other body parts not nor-
mally mentioned in a G-rated book such as this) because everybody 
has one. I’m sorry, Andy, but in my humble opinion the animations 
are innovative and not at all “sock-puppety.” In fact, I’d go so far as to 
say that I think Comixology’s Guided View looks much better than the 
other comic book reader apps that abruptly jump from panel to panel. 
Call me ignorant or unsophisticated or whatever you like, but I say 
Guided View is very cool and is a reason to love this app. 

11
The free Comics app includes more than 65 free comics, including a 
good exclusive weekly series — Box 13. If you want more comics, use 
the Comics app’s excellent in-app comic store (see the figure on the 
right), which offers hundreds of comics and series and generally lets 
you download for free the first issue in a series to see if you like it 
enough to buy subsequent issues. Most of the comics in the store cost 
99¢ to $1.99. 
New releases are available every Wednesday, so visit the store often 
to check out the latest and greatest offerings. And speaking of new 
offerings, the latest version of Comics, which came out while I was 
writing this chapter, offers push notifications so you’ll never miss new 
issues of your favorite comic book series.
Finally, both the store and your personal comic collection are well-
organized and easy to use. 
Best features
Comics provides a fantastic viewing experience — immersive, enjoy-
able, and more cinematic than you expect from a comic book. 
Worst features
Comics offers lots of different comics, but I’ve never heard of many of 
them. Although that’s not necessarily a bad thing, I’d love to see more 
comics from the big guys (such as Marvel and DC Comics) available in 
the Comics store.

Kindle for iPhone
 
Free
Amazon.com’s free Kindle app lets you shop for hundreds of   thousands 
of eBooks, newspapers, and magazines at Amazon.com and read them 
at your leisure on your iPhone. 
Before I tell you about the Kindle app, though, you need to know 
about the Kindle device that it emulates. 
The Kindle is Amazon.com’s $250+ wireless handheld reading device 
(see the figure on the left), which lets you shop for, buy, and read Kindle 
books, magazines, and newspapers on its black-and-white screen. 
The Kindle app for the iPhone (see the figure on the right) does more 
or less the same things as a Kindle, but on your iPhone instead of on a 
separate, bulky, expensive, single-purpose device. 
Amazon’s Kindle store offers more than 350,000 books, as well as news-
papers, magazines, and blogs at prices well below their printed counter-
parts. You can read the books, newspapers, and magazines you buy on 
the Kindle device or on your iPhone with the free Kindle app. 
The best thing about reading anything on either the Kindle device or 
with the Kindle app is that prices for the electronic versions of books 
are almost always a lot less than the printed versions. For example, 
some of the best deals are on The New York Times Best Sellers, which 
generally cost just $9.99 for the Kindle version. At press time, examples 
of best-selling titles include Dan Brown’s The Lost Symbol ($29.95 in 
print; 67% saved); James Patterson and Richard DiLallo’s Alex Cross’s 
Trial ($27.99 in print; 64% saved); E. L. Doctorow’s Homer & Langley: 
A Novel ($26 i n print; 62% saved); and Jon Krakauer’s Where Men 
Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman ($27.95 in print; 64% saved). 
Magazines and newspaper subscriptions are less expensive than their 
hard copy counterparts, too. For example, The New York Times Kindle 
Edition costs $13.99 per month (vs. $45–$60 per month depending on 
where you live), and many magazines are less than $2 per month.
Another unique feature of both the Kindle device and the Kindle app 
for the iPhone is that you can read the beginning of any book free 
before you buy it. 
How does the free Kindle iPhone app stack up to the $250 Kindle 
device? Glad you asked! The Kindle has a bigger screen than your 
iPhone and includes a physical keyboard. Unlike your iPhone, the 
Kindle has a black-and-white screen and doesn’t include e-mail, maps, 
a camera, SMS or MMS messaging, a music player, or a video player. 
And, of course, you can’t install iPhone apps on it.
Chapter 1: Books

The Kindle iPhone app lets you read in portrait or landscape mode, 
choose the text size, choose background and text colors, add bookmarks, 
and zoom in and out at will. You can also create notes that are backed 
up automatically, as well as synchronized with your Kindle device (if you 
happen to own one in addition to owning the Kindle iPhone app).
To be perfectly fair, the Kindle iPhone app lacks some of the Kindle 
device’s features, such as a battery that lasts for days, text-to-speech, 
full-text search, and a highlighter. 
That said, do you really want to pay $250 to lug around a device four 
or five times larger than your iPhone just to read books and newspa-
pers on a bigger black-and-white screen?
I thought not.
Best features
The best thing about the Kindle app is that the Kindle store has a huge 
selection of titles, and you can carry almost anything you care to read 
in your pocket without spending $250 on a separate electronic device. 
Worst features
You can’t buy books from within the app. It’s awkward to shop for and 
purchase books using a Web browser, and it’s especially awkward to 
do so with Safari on your iPhone’s 3.5-inch screen.  Lastly, as I men-
tioned earlier, the iPhone app lacks a search function or highlighter.

Stanza
 
Free
Stanza is another free eBook reader with more and better features 
t han th e  Kindle app but a significantly smaller selection of titles. 
 
Unlike the Kindle, there’s not a $250 handheld Stanza device, but I sus-
pect most of you won’t care.
Stanza has all the features that are missing from the Kindle app and 
more. Some of Stanza’s niceties include almost infinite control over 
page layout, so you can specify not only font size but also margins, 
line and paragraph spacing, indentation, page color, and more. Being 
able to adjust layout settings makes a huge difference, especially if 
you read in a variety of places with different types of lighting. 
You can look up words using the built-in dictionary and jot down 
annotations, as you can see in the figure on the left. 
Plus, you can search for a word or phrase in any book, sort your library 
by title or author, or even create custom collections within your library. 
If you’re a fan of the Cover Flow view found in iTunes and Mac OS X 
Leopard and Snow Leopard, you’ll be pleased to know that you can 
browse your Stanza library in a Cover Flow–like view. And, although this 
is kind of silly, if you don’t like the cover that came with a book, you can 
replace it with other artwork using Stanza’s Cover Lookup feature. 
You can set multiple bookmarks in each book, and if you leave the app 
for any reason — a phone call, text message, or just because your eyes 
are tired — Stanza remembers where you left off and takes you back 
to that page the next time you launch the app.
If you read in multiple languages, you’ll be pleased to know that the 
Stanza app includes built-in support for English, French, German, Italian, 
Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Danish, Portuguese, and Swedish. 
Best of all, Stanza has a fabulous built-in catalog so you can download 
free content and purchase contemporary books without leaving the 
app, which is something you can’t do with the Kindle app. 
With the Kindle, you’re limited to content you get at the Kindle Store 
on Amazon.com. Stanza offers titles from multiple sources, including 
Random House Free Library, Harlequin Books, and all 25,000+ books from 
Project Gutenberg, some of which are shown in the figure on the right. 
Some of the available authors include Stephanie Meyer (Twilight), Dan 
Brown (The DaVinci Code), Malcom Gladwell, (Blink), Barack Obama 
Chapter 1: Books 

15
(The Audacity of Hope), Stephen King (too many titles to name), and 
James Patterson (ditto). 
Stanza offers access to a lot of free books, probably more than any 
other app I’ve tested, including most (if not all) of the titles found in 
Classics2Go Collection, as well as other titles from authors such as Edgar 
Allen Poe, Oscar Wilde, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and P. G. Wodehouse.
The Stanza catalog is easy to use and makes finding titles easy to 
do. You can browse by subject, language, or author, or you can use 
Stanza’s excellent search mechanism.
This app has been lauded by TIME magazine (Top 11 iPhone Apps), PC 
Magazine (Editor’s Choice), Wired (10 Most Awesome iPhone Apps), 
and BestAppEver.com. Because Stanza is free, you have no excuse not 
to give it a try. 
Best features
I love having complete control over the way my pages look. I wish every 
app I use to read anything had this feature. I also like all the thoughtful 
touches such as search, built-in dictionary, and instant annotation.
Worst features
The biggest drawback to this app is its smaller selection of titles (com-
pared to Kindle).

 IVerse Comics
 
Free
IVerse Comics is another comic book reader and store that lets you 
download both fr e e  a nd inexpensive issues of comic books. Like the 
Comics app, it has an integrated comic book viewer and is free. 
IVerse Comics isn’t as elegant as the Comics app. In portrait mode you 
see a full comic book page at once. To see panels at a readable size, 
though, you have to flip your phone into landscape mode, which feels 
clunky compared to Guided View in Comics.
On the other hand, IVerse Comics offers titles not available in the 
Comics app, including Archie comics, Dean Koontz graphic novels, and 
the excellent Dynamo 5 series.
  Grimm’s Fairy Tales by Jacob & 
Wilhelm Grimm
 
Free
I’ve always preferred the darker Grimm versions of fairy tale classics 
such as Sle eping  B eauty and Snow White to the sanitized Disney rendi-
tions, so I was tickled to discover this app. 
In addition to more than 200 stories, this free app has pretty much 
every feature you could ask for and then some. You can choose the 
typeface, font size, text color, and paper color. The unique AutoScroll 
feature, which causes the text to scroll up the screen, much like a tele-
prompter, is way cool. It takes a few minutes to get the hang of using 
AutoScroll, but after you do, you’ll wish every app offered it. 
 Holy Bible
 
Free
The Holy Bible app includes six complete translations of the Holy 
Bible. If that’s not enou gh, with a couple of taps you can download 
more than a dozen additional translations, including the World English 
Bible, American Standard Version, and even the Bible in Basic English. 

17
 Chapter 1: Books
The presentation is slick and professional and includes useful features 
such as search, notes, bookmarks, and more. I like the way you can 
drag your finger up or down the right side of the screen to jump to a 
specific verse.
Unlike most apps, you won’t have to wish that the Holy Bible app had 
AutoScroll because it does. 
 Self Help Classics
 
$0.99 US
They say that if something sounds too good to be true it usually is. 
With the complete text of 16 self-help books for less than a buck, Self 
Help Classics isn’t one of those things. It’s good and it’s true. 
The titles include Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, The Master 
Key System by Charles F. Haanel, The Art of Public Speaking by Dale 
Carnegie and Joseph Berg Esenwein, plus the autobiography of 
Andrew Carnegie, America’s first self-made billionaire. 
Then there’s the app itself, which is nicely designed and has book-
marks, font size control, navigation shortcut buttons, and (yea!) 
AutoScroll. Furthermore, the text is nicely set and easy to read.
 Shakespeare
 
Free
If you’re a fan of the Bard you’ll love this free app, which includes the 
full texts of 40 plays, all 6 poems, all 154 sonnets, and a searchable 
concordance. 
Produced in part by PlayShakespeare.com, which is known as “the 
ultimate free Shakespeare resource,” the works in this app are drawn 
from the First Folio of 1623 (and Quartos where applicable) and the 
Globe Edition of 1866, which have been re-edited and updated to 
reflect the editorial standards of PlayShakespeare.com’s scholarly 
team. 
Finally, this is one of the few apps that has a landscape reading option 
that hides all the buttons and controls when you turn your iPhone 
sideways. Yea!

Business Card Reader
 
 
$ 5.99 US
B usiness Card Reader does just what its name 
implies — takes pictures of business cards and 
then uses text recognition to convert them into 
editable text in the appropriate fields of the 
iPhone’s Contacts app. 
This app is slick, but before you get too excited 
you should know that you need an iPhone 3GS 
to shoot a close-up of a business card that’s 
good enough for Business Card Reader to 
translate accurately. That said, if you have a 
first- or second-generation iPhone, you may not 
be completely out of luck. Griffin Technology 
makes a polycarbonate case called Clarifi (dis-
cussed in Chapter 19) that includes a built-in close-up lens that lets you 
use Business Card Reader with any iPhone. 
Using Business Card Reader couldn’t be easier. To capture the infor-
mation from a business card you tap either the Take Photo button or 
the Select Picture button. The card is  scanned, as shown in the figure 
on the left. When the scanning is finished, the New Contact screen 
appears, as shown in the figure on the right.
At this point you can 
 
✓ (Optional) Edit the information
 
✓ Tap the Done button to add the information to the iPhone’s 
Contacts app as a new contact
 
✓ Tap the Merge with Existing Contact button to merge the informa-
tion with a contact that’s already in your Contacts list
 
✓ Tap Cancel to throw the info away and not use it at all
 
✓ Tap LinkedIn Lookup to look up the person at www.linkedin.com
 
✓ Tap View Recognized Info as Plain Text to see all the words the 
OCR (Optical Character Recognitio n) technology translated on a 
single screen with no fields
I’d be remiss if I let you believe that every card you scan is recognized 
as flawlessly as the one shown. (By the way, I purposely blurred the

person’s name and company to protect the innocent.) In this case, 
Business Card Reader made just one mistake: It read Publie instead of 
Public, as you can see in the figure on the right. The rest of the text — 
phone number, company name, address, and so on — was recognized 
with 100% accuracy. 
The card I used for this demo worked excellently with OCR. The text is 
extremely clear; the background is plain white; the items are logically 
grouped and reasonably spaced. 
Business Card Reader has a much tougher time with stylishly 
designed cards that have busy multi-colored backgrounds, text in 
decorative fonts, or light colored text against a dark background. To 
its credit, the app was 70 to 80 percent accurate, even on cards with 
all three of the aforementioned issues. 
 
For the best results, make sure you have plenty of light when you pho-
tograph the card. 
Best features
B usiness Card Reader can save you a lot of typing. And it gives you 
something to do on the plane ride home from a conference where 
you’ve collected a lot of business cards.
Worst features
Business Card Reader produces mediocre results if the card’s design 
is too artistic.

 Convertbot
 
$0.99 US
Th ere is no shortage of iPhone apps that perform unit conversion, 
such as centimeters to inches, Euros to U.S. dollars, gallons to liters, 
Fahrenheit to Celsius, and such. I found dozens upon dozens of them 
while researching this chapter; by the time you read this chapter 
there will surely be dozens upon dozens more. Although I didn’t test 
every single conversion app, I did test enough to know that if you’re 
only going to have one conversion utility on your iPhone, Convertbot 
is the one you want. 
I have three reasons for concluding that Convertbot is the crème de la 
crème of unit converters: 
 
1. It has a beautiful and functional user interface, which you can 
see in both figures. 
 
2. It offers a massive number of unit categories and types. 
 
3. It offers myriad options for customization.
Let’s start with examining Convertbot’s  interface, which is as easy 
to use as it is beautiful. After picking a category, I select the type of 
units I want to convert by tapping their names on the unit wheel. In 
the figure on the left, I’m converting inches to feet and inches. I used 
the Convertbot numeric keypad (not shown) to specify 91 inches as 
the From value, and the converted To value (7 feet 7 inches) instantly 
appears below it.
Convertbot supports more than 440 different kinds of units in 19 sepa-
rate categories. For example, it can convert between more than 100 
different currencies (such as Gold, Silver, Platinum, and Aluminum 
ounces, as well as the currencies of most civilized nations), nearly 
50 different measures of volume (such as bushel, dram, dry pint, and 
teaspoon), and 40 different measures of length (such as mil, nautical 
mile, smoot, and league). Convertbot also handles hundreds of other 
unit types in 16 other categories that include mass, power, fuel, speed, 
area, data rate, and data size. There are, in fact, so many different 
types of units that I discovered dozens of them I’d never he ard of. For 
example, do you know what a gigapascal, becquerel, didot  , kanejaku, 
or tsubo measure is? I didn’t, but I do now (they measure pressure, 
radioactivity, typography, length, and area, respectively). 
20
Chapter 2: Business 

21
Finally, you can disable categories you don’t need (Angle, Force, and 
Fuel in the figure on the right) and enable the units you do need within 
each category. In the figure on the right, 10 of 18 units for Area; 9 of 
138 for Currency; 17 of 38 for Data Rate; and 10 of 22 for Data Size have 
been enabled. As you may expect, limiting the choices makes it much 
quicker and easier to find and use the categories and units you need. 
Other niceties of Convertbot include the capability to update all cur-
rency values when you launch the app and have an Internet connec-
tion. There’s also an optional calculator in which you can specify up 
to 15 places in your calculations. 
Convertbot is easy to use, looks great, lets you tailor its capabilities 
to your actual needs, and costs a lot less than a gallon of milk (which 
equals 3.785412 liters or 8 pints or 16 cups or 128 fluid ounces or. . .). 
If you ever need to convert units of measure, you need Convertbot.
Best features
Convertbot is comprehensive, easy to use, and offers a beautiful and 
extremely customizable interface, yet it costs less than a buck. 
Worst features
Convertbot can tell you how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon, but 
it can’t cook dinner for you. In other words, I can’t think of a single fea-
ture that’s “bad,” much less one that’s the “worst.”

 GetPaid! 
 
$4.99  US
GetPaid tracks the time you spend on each job and instantly generates 
an invoice in either PDF or HTML format. The app’s user interface is 
designed to be easy to use on the job, and it allows you to enter infor-
mation quickly and painlessly. 
In my other life, I’m a computer consultant, technician, and trainer, 
and I still make house calls. Before I got this app, I often forgot to track 
when I started and ended a job. In order to not overbill my clients, I 
often billed them for less time than I had actually spent working on the 
job. Because I usually sent invoices from my office, I also sometimes 
entirely forgot to bill a client. I had no organized system to keep track 
of my hours or earnings. Even worse, I didn’t have any formal system 
for tracking invoices, much less which ones had or had not been paid.
Now I use GetPaid to do all of these things and more. It’s so easy to 
use that I never feel like I’m taking away valuable time from the job. 
If a client is in my iPhone Contacts list, with a couple of taps I can add 
the client to GetPaid. And, of course, I can add new clients manually. 
Keeping track of the time I spend on each job takes only a few taps. 
Generating an invoice is a piece of cake and requires only a few more 
taps (see the figure on the left). After creating an invoice, I can tap the 
Email button to e-mail the invoice as a PDF or HTML file right from my 
iPhone, or I can use GetPaid’s built-in Wi-Fi–based export mechanism 
to copy invoices to my computer for printing.
GetPaid is not only quick and easy to use; it’s also quite flexible. For 
example, charging different rates for different services is not a problem, 
which is great because I charge a different rate for repair services than 
I do for training. GetPaid also keeps track of multiple sessions with the 
same client so that I can easily invoice for the total.
Other niceties include built-in passcode protection for the app, data 
backup and restore, job data exporting (as a .CSV file that you can 
import to any spreadsheet or database), previews of finished invoices, 
time-rounding options, plus a calculator, currency converter, and 
support for international currencies.

23
The other thing I really like about GetPaid is that I can view paid and 
unpaid invoices as a pie chart (as shown in the figure on the right) or 
line graph, which allows me to instantly see my earnings for the past 
week, month, three months, six months, or year.
Finally, I like that the developers ask for feedback on the app and ask 
users to e-mail them requests for additional timesheet and invoice 
templates. The developers say they will “find ways to build it.”
If you’re a freelancer, mobile professional, temp, consultant, contrac-
tor, or anyone else who needs to track your time to get paid, I’ve yet 
to find an easier, faster method than the GetPaid app. 
Best features
GetPaid makes it really fast and easy to track time spent on jobs, gen-
erate invoices, and track the payment of those invoices. Every part of 
the app is designed for speed, and it’s so simple to use you’ll probably 
never need to look at the comprehensive online help.
Worst features
For some unfathomable reason, you can’t preview invoices in land-
scape mode, which makes it harder than it should be to check over an 
invoice before you send it.

 Jaadu VNC
 
$24.99 US
Jaadu VNC is one of the coolest and most useful apps I have on my 
iPhone, and by far it’s the best app I’ve tested for remotely controlling 
my home or office computer. Jaadu VNC can remotely control comput-
ers running Mac, Windows, Linux, and AMX touch screen operating 
systems. 
If you’ve never used a VNC (which stands for Virtual Network 
Computing) program to control your computer remotely, here’s how 
VNC, also known as screen sharing, works. In a nutshell, VNC lets you 
see a computer’s screen and control its mouse and keyboard from 
another computer — or, in this case, your iPhone — in another loca-
tion. To prepare a computer for remote control, you first install soft-
ware called a VNC server. For Jaadu VNC, you can download the server 
software free from the Jaadu Web site. As long as the computer has 
an Internet connection and is running VNC server software, you can 
use a username and password to connect to and control the computer 
from a VNC client app using any computer or iPhone anywhere in the 
world. 
If you’ve never tried remote control computing, it’s a fabulous tool 
that can be a real lifesaver. VNC has saved my bacon more times than 
I care to remember. For example, I can log into my office computer 
from wherever I happen to be to look at the e-mail in my Inbox, as 
shown in the figure on the left. If there’s an urgent message in my 
Inbox, I can forward it to my iPhone and deal with it from there, or I 
can reply to the message from my office computer by typing on my 
iPhone. When I grocery shop, I use Jaadu VNC to look up a recipe 
on my home computer so that I can be sure to get every ingredient I 
need. Finally, if I’m away from home and someone calls and says they 
desperately need a document that’s on my Mac, I can use Jaadu VNC 
to e-mail the person a copy of the document, even if I happen to be on 
the other side of the world at the time. 
Jaadu VNC has full keyboard support, so you can use it to type in any 
app that’s running on your remote computer. It also supports modi-
fier keys such as those shown left to right near the top of the figure 
on the right: Shift, Control, Ô, and Option, as well as shortcut buttons 
for common activities such as quit (an application), close (a window), 
switch (applications), select all, cut, copy, and paste, which are also 
shown in the figure on the right.
Chapter 2: Business 

25
I’ve tried several similar but less-expensive VNC client apps that claim 
to do what Jaadu VNC does, but not a single one has worked nearly as 
well or as reliably.
Best features
Jaadu VNC lets me be at my computer even when I’m thousands of 
miles away from it. No matter what emergency crops up, if there’s 
something I need from my home or office Mac, Jaadu VNC gives me 
a way to access what I need from wherever I happen to be. This app 
may seem expensive, but to me, it’s worth every cent.
Worst features
I use two displays at home, but Jaadu VNC can only access the main 
one (the one with the menu bar). Consequently, I have to make sure 
that I don’t leave windows or icons on the secondary display if I think I 
might need to use them via Jaadu VNC.

 Presenter Pro
 
$1.99 US
Presenter Pro is a training app that offers superb guidance for anyone 
who needs to give a presentation to an audience. Regardless of the 
content of the presentation, the software used, the projection equip-
ment, or the size of the room or audience, Presenter Pro is chock-full 
of terrific advice and tips to help you convey your message memora-
bly and effectively. 
Using a combination of text, photos, audio and video clips, real-world 
examples, pop-up tips, thought-provoking exercises, and useful quiz-
zes, Presenter Pro conveys a plethora of information without being 
preachy or boring. I have a short attention span, so I really appreciate 
that the app stays on topic and uses a variety of media to keep things 
interesting. 
Here’s how Presenter Pro works. The main screen has six but-
tons: Structure, Visuals, Words, Voice, Gestures, and Rate Me, as 
shown in the figure on the left. Tapping any of the first five buttons 
reveals a long list of short subtopics. For example, if you tap Words, 
you see entries that include Affirmative Words, Avoid Apologies, 
Condescension, and Words for Humans. Tapping a subtopic reveals a 
textual description that may also include photos, drawings (as shown 
in the figure on the right), or audio and video clips. 
The sixth button, Rate Me, has two possible uses. Using a scale from 
one to ten, you can rate other presenters or have someone else rate 
your presentation in areas such as captivating opening, supportive 
visuals, expressive voice, audience rapport, and memorable ending. 
You can then save the ratings or e-mail them to someone with a 
couple additional taps. 
In addition to the main screen, there are four buttons at the bottom of 
the screen: Quiz, Videos, Checklist, and Help. Quiz offers a test with 
approximately ten questions in each of the main categories — struc-
ture, visuals, words, voice, and gestures. Videos provides instant access 
to the video clips sprinkled throughout the rest of the app. Checklist 
lets you swipe your finger across a paragraph you want to remember 
to instantly copy the information to the checklist. I use the checklist to 
gather all the things I consider most important so that I can read them 
just before I hit the stage. Help includes a quick overview of the app’s 
components and a brief description of how to use each one. 
Another nice touch in Presenter Pro is the “tip shaker” option, which 
can display a quick tip when you give your iPhone a little shake.
Chapter 2: Business

I’ve delivered hundreds of presentations to audiences of all sizes in 
dozens of countries. I’m not trying to sound smug, but I have a lot of 
experience presenting information to crowds, and I think I’ve become 
pretty good at it over the years. Even so, I looked at every screen in 
this app before I put together my most recent presentation (to the 
Chicago Apple User Group), and I am certain my show was noticeably 
improved by it. 
If you don’t present often, Presenter Pro can help you improve your 
delivery, increase your confidence, and avoid mistakes. But even if 
delivering presentations is your bread and butter, I’m convinced you’ll 
find a lot of useful information in this app.
Best features
Presenter Pro is chock-full of useful information to help you improve 
your presentation skills. Regardless of whether you’re a neophyte or 
a seasoned public speaker, you can benefit from spending some time 
with this app.
Worst features
I would like the app even more if it contained more media — more 
illustrations, photos, and audio and video clips. Aside from that, 
though, I don’t have anything to complain about.

 AltaMail 
 
$9.99 US
AltaMail  is a powerful alternative to the Mail app included with your 
iPhone. AltaMail offers an extensive list of unique features; the one I find 
most useful is the contact e-mail view, which lets me see all incoming 
and outgoing messages from or to any contact. Other powerful features 
of the app include multiple signatures with images, printing via your 
Mac or PC locally or remotely, zipping and unzipping file attachments, 
and attaching more than one image or file to a single message. 
The more e-mail you send and receive on your iPhone, the more you’ll 
appreciate AltaMail.
 Documents to Go
 
$9.99 US
I think  I tried every app that claims to be able to edit Microsoft Word 
and Excel files, and Documents to Go by DataViz is the only one that 
worked consistently and rendered documents accurately. It can 
create, open, and edit Word and Excel documents, including their 
latest file formats (.docx and .xlsx, respectively). It supports lots 
of character, paragraph, cell, and number formatting options; Wi-Fi 
sync; cut, copy, and paste; and multiple undo/redo options. The 
Word module supports predictive text, auto-correction, and auto-
capitalization; the Excel module has 111 mathematical functions and 
supports multiple worksheets. 
If you need to work with Microsoft Office documents, this is the app 
you want.
 FTP On The Go
 
$6.99 US
FTP On The Go is a full-featured FTP client for your iPhone. It lets 
you browse, upload, and download files from any FTP server, using 
FTPS and data compression if the server supports them. Perhaps the 
most useful feature of FTP On The Go is its capability to download a 
text file, edit it using the app’s built-in text editor, and re-upload the

changed file. You can resize images before you upload them, and if 
you have an iPhone 3GS, you can even upload video. With bookmarks, 
password protection, and CHMOD permission editing, you can easily 
use FTP On The Go to manage a Web site with your iPhone, and that’s 
way cool.
 Print n Share 
 
$6.99 US
If you ever have to print documents on your Mac or PC locally over 
your Wi-Fi network or remotely over 3G or EDGE, Print n Share is 
what you need. It includes a built-in Wi-Fi hard drive that lets you drag 
and drop files between your iPhone and your computer. It also lets 
you zip, unzip, and view .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .txt, .html, .PDF, and 
many other file types before you print them. With a Web browser that 
can print pages and offers flexible photo printing, Print n Share is the 
only way to go if you need to be able to print documents from your 
iPhone.
 QuickVoice2Text Email 
 
(PRO Recorder)
 
$0.99 US
QuickVoice2Text Email (PRO Recorder) is one of my favorite and 
most-used apps. It lets you speak into your iPhone and then translates 
your spoken words to text before e-mailing both the recording and the 
text to anyone you choose. I use this app many times a day to send 
myself reminders of things I need to do or to create and send e-mail at 
times when it would be inconvenient or time-consuming to type them 
on my iPhone. 
QuickVoice2Text Email works great, translates speech to text as accu-
rately as anything I’ve ever used, and costs only 99¢. How can you not 
love that?

 Bobble Rep
 
 
$0.99 US
Boy, did this app cause a ruckus when it 
was first released — or wasn’t released, as 
the case may be. At first, Apple rejected 
Bobble Rep for “ridiculing public figures.” 
I guess that someone on the App Store 
approval team had never heard of a carica-
ture. Fortunately, however, after the story 
broke and everybody and their brother 
in the blogosphere started talking about 
Bobble Rep, Apple reversed its decision 
and approved the app. 
The decision to approve the app is a good 
thing. Bobble Rep isn’t an engine of politi-
cal commentary; it’s a non-partisan, simple, 
and easy-to-use database for identifying 
and contacting your representative in the U.S. Congress, be he or she 
a Senator or Representative.
Tom Richmond created all the artwork for this app. If the images in 
Bobble Rep look familiar, you may know Tom from his work as a con-
tributor to MAD Magazine or from the movie Super Capers. I just love 
the art in this app, and it seems to resonate with just about everyone 
who checks it out.
On the useful side, Bobble Rep — 111th Congress Edition (as it is offi-
cially called) offers contact information for every member of the 111th 
Congress (look for dedicated versions for future Congresses) from 
A (see the figure on the left) to Z (ditto the figure on the right). You 
can look up members by name, party-affiliation, state, class (the year 
their term ends), or address. You can even perform searches by using 
Current Location if you don’t want to bother entering your full address.
 
Tilt your iPhone when viewing a member’s page for the full bobblehead 
experience.
The easiest ways to pull up your members of Congress are to use the 
address or Current Location lookups. Although many of us (I’d like to

think most of us) know who our Senators are, fewer people know their 
Representatives. Bobble Rep makes it easy to find out who’s repre-
senting you in Washington. 
After you pull up a member, you see the aforementioned caricature, 
detailed contact information — including a link to the member’s official 
government-hosted Web site — a direct link to the official Web contact 
form, and all of the member’s local offices, including phone numbers.
The sweet thing about the phone numbers is that they’re iPhone links — 
just tap a number and your iPhone calls it for you. It’s never been so easy 
to call your Congressional representatives. Contacting your members 
of Congress and letting them know your opinion on issues important to 
you is a valuable part of the political process, no matter which side of the 
aisle your Senator or Representative sits on.
Best features 
Bobble Rep includes great art and information you need — it’s a great 
combo!
Worst features 
I’d like to be able to flick through the members of Congress in the 
information-pane mode, but I have a feeling the database is just 
too big for the iPhone to handle in that manner. I’d also like e-mail 
addresses to be listed in the contact information.

 Civilization Revolution (Sid Meier)
 
$6.99 US
I can hear you now: “Hey mom, Dr. Mac says this iPhone game is 
educational!” Hey, it is educational, but it’s also fun, which makes 
this app a win-win. The Civilization games have been around for a 
long time. Although the games are hardly a substitute for a history 
book, I think they present a practical lesson in the way economics 
work. Specifically, these games teach what is called Guns and Butter 
Economics, which is the balance governments must take between mili-
tary and domestic spending.
See, you’re learning something already! Anyway, all the Civilization 
games on the PC and Mac make players balance what they spend on 
the military (guns) and civilian needs (butter). Spend too much on 
one and the other suffers, which is likely to cost you the game. When 
you throw in the need to balance expansion with sustainable growth, 
there’s even more to learn before you can master the game.
What I found most surprising about the iPhone version of Civilization is 
just how playable it is on a handheld device. Before I downloaded the 
app, I thought it would be too difficult to play on the iPhone; but the real-
ity is that it’s fun. The developers didn’t try to shoehorn everything from 
the desktop game into the iPhone. Instead, they put a lot of thought into 
what makes an iPhone app work, as you can see in the figure.
The units are easy to control, movement is intuitive, cities are easy 
to manage, and even the combat makes sense. The planet size is big 
enough to be interesting, but it’s not so big as to leave you feeling like 
you can’t grasp everything. If you’re brand new to the Civilization fran-
chise, there’s a built-in tutorial that explains everything you need to 
know without getting in the way.
 
When starting out, be sure to send a unit into the villages in order to 
find gold, free units (the best is a free Settler unit for what amounts to 
a free town in the beginning!), or technology. When your civilization is 
capable of deep-water ocean travel, look for the Lost City of Atlantis 
for several free advanced technologies.
The game includes several levels of difficulty, and you can choose which 
leaders or culture you want to play. The game also offers a scenario mode 
with predefined goals that change up the game play quite a bit. After 
you’ve mastered the game, try Beta-Centauri mode, where you start off 
on a fresh planet, but you already know all the technologies!
32
Chapter 3: Education 

33
I’m telling you, this game really surprised me in how much fun it is. 
The only downside is that I found the game crashed frequently near 
the end of long play. As of this writing, the game doesn’t have an auto-
save feature, so I found myself manually saving frequently to keep 
from having to replay lost game-years when the game crashed.
I hope that by the time you read this book, auto-saves will have been 
added in an update. But even if the game still lacks auto-save, get this 
app anyway. You’ll love it, and you may actually learn a thing or two!
There’s a free Lite version for those who want to try before they buy. 
It’s feature-limited and doesn’t have a save-game feature, so the Lite 
version isn’t a substitute for the real thing. But it does show you what 
the game play is like.
Best features 
Fun, intuitive game play brings the best aspects of the Civilization 
franchise to your iPhone in a way that makes sense. You’ll wonder 
where the time goes when you’re playing the game.
Worst features 
The lack of an auto-save feature can result in the loss of turns played 
at the end of very long games.

Dictionary!
 
Fre e
Maybe it’s because I write for a living, but I’ve always felt a good dic-
tionary is priceless; and the ability to carry one in my pocket may be 
one of the best aspects of having an iPhone!
Several dictionary apps are available for the iPhone, but I picked 
Dictionary! because it’s free (it’s ad supported) and easy to use. It 
includes more than 200,000 words and phrases, and the definitions are 
purposefully short and simple.
The interface is straightforward. To look up a word or phrase, you 
type it in a field, and the results appear in real-time.
When you find the word you want, tap it, and the definition is displayed 
at the bottom of the screen, as shown in the figure on the left. See 
the blue line (with a little ^ in the middle of it) that separates the 
definition from the search results? As you drag the line toward the 
top of the screen, it opens the definitions pane to full screen so 
that you can more easily read the results (see the figure on the right 
below). This is especially handy for words that have several definitions.
The 200,000 definitions I mentioned earlier are included in the app itself, 
so Dictionary! works whether or not you are online or have a cell con-
nection with your iPhone. The English language has more than 800,000 
words, however, and when you are online, Dictionary! can perform 
lookups on Wiktionary.com for definitions that aren’t in the app. To 
access the online lookup, open the definition pane and click the Open 
Wiktionary in Safari button in the lower-right corner of the window.
Another cool feature is the capability to copy a definition for use in 
another iPhone app, such as Mail or a Twitter app. Touch and hold 
on a definition, and the iPhone OS 3.0 copy box appears around the 
definition. Touch the Copy button that appears, and the definition is 
saved to your clipboard for you to use elsewhere.
Chapter 3: Education 

35
All in all, Dictionary! is a great example of a dictionary for your iPhone.
 
When you first run the app, it spends a few minutes building an 
index of itself. This is a file-size–saving feature the developers used 
to keep the app small enough to download over a 3G network. After 
Dictionary! runs this indexing process, you won’t have to do it again.
Best features 
Short and useful definitions make for fast lookups and quick under-
standing. The ability to look up additional definitions on Wiktion-
ary.com is handy for those rare times when you need to look up a 
word that’s not included in the internal definitions.
Worst features
The ads take up screen real estate, but that’s a small price to pay for 
such a useful, free app.

 Musé e du Louvre
 
Free
Musée du Louvre offers a detailed look at the museum that most of us 
call “The Louvre” or “Le Louvre.” One of the world’s most famous muse-
ums, Le Louvre houses the Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, Diana Leaving Her 
Bath, and about a gillion other pieces of art, from small to great.
The iPhone app, which was published by the museum itself, offers 
what is effectively a brief, but detailed, tour of the museum. The tour 
includes images, video, information about the palace (it was built in 
the 12th Century as a fortress, and eventually housed French royalty, 
including some of the Napolean family), and handy visitor information 
about the museum.
I gravitate to the artwork section, which is presented in an iPhone 
Cover Flow format. Starting with the Mona Lisa front and center, you 
can flip through a score or so of the major artworks on display at the 
museum. Tap an individual painting, sculpture, or other piece of art, 
and a larger image of the work opens. Tap the larger image, and you 
get a new pane with buttons for About the Work (as shown in the 
figure), See More Detail, Technical Information, and Location.
You can use the buttons to get a history of the work, including who 
created it, what it is about, and what kinds of material were used to 
create it. The See More Detail button offers close-up images of the art, 
which you can zoom in on by using the iPhone’s pinch gestures. The 
Location button reveals a map that shows where the artwork is dis-
played in the museum. All these features are really cool.
But wait, there’s more! Musée du Louvre includes several high-
definition videos of different pieces of art and parts of the museum. 
In a great use of Apple technology, each video is narrated in French, 
English, German, and Japanese. Note that the default language is 
French, but you can change it by tapping the information icon on 
the playback controls — this feature isn’t readily apparent, so many 
people think the videos are offered only in French. The videos are all 
very cool, and my only complaint is that there aren’t more of them.
The Palace section of the app offers a detailed look at the major sec-
tions of the building that houses the museum. Tap a selection in Cover 
Flow mode, and you get a picture with options for a short history, 
detailed pictures you can flip through, a video (if one is available — 
you’re linked to the same videos mentioned earlier), and a map of the 
section in the museum.

37
If you find something you particularly like or want to come back to, 
you can bookmark entries by tapping the star on the entry’s main 
page. You can access bookmarks from the main window of the app.
If you’re lucky enough to be going to Le Louvre in person, the app 
offers directions, hours of operation, admission fees, information 
about the different services and amenities offered, as well as contact 
information. Being able to access this information makes this app 
invaluable to anyone who’s going to see the real deal.
The text in the app is searchable, which makes it easy to find what 
you’re looking for.
If you’re interested in art or French history and architecture (including 
all the gilded gaudiness of royal excess in the 18th and 19th centuries), 
Musée de Louvre is a great way to see some of what’s in this world-
famous museum.
Best features 
The wealth of information contained in the app is wonderful, and the 
developers made it easy to access. Better yet, it’s free.
Worst features 
The app has so much content in it, flipping through the information 
can sometimes cause the app to stutter. Also, because of all the con-
tent, the app is a big download (62MB).

 Star Walk
 
$4.99 US
Hey, is that the universe in your pocket, or are you just happy to see 
me? OK, OK, I kid, but having Star Walk on my iPhone really does 
make me feel like I have the universe at my fingertips!
Star Walk is part digital telescope, part sky-map, and part star database. 
You can look up stars and constellations, and you can even get informa-
tion on the auroras and other atmospheric phenomenon. The app also 
includes information on the moon phases and enables you to look at the 
sky as you are seeing it tonight or as it will look one year from now.
When you launch Star Walk, you see a segment of the night sky as it 
appears based on your Location Services info. You can drag the map 
around to see different parts of the sky, and you can double tap to 
zoom in closer to more easily see individual stars.
For instance, I found Rigel (because it was featured in a Star Trek 
episode — I know, I’m a geek!), and double tapped it until I could see 
it and only a handful of other stars. By clicking the i button in the top 
left, I learned some geeky info such as Rigel is in the Orion constellation 
and it has a visual magnitude of 0.1.
The stars are displayed with their actual colors, and major features of 
the night sky are labeled for you. As you move the map around, abstract 
representations of the constellations and other features appear in real-
time.
Information about the planets includes their order in the solar system, 
mass, radius, and surface temperature.
 
One of the coolest features of this app is limited to the iPhone 3GS 
because that version of the iPhone has a compass and the built-in GPS 
system. When you tilt your iPhone 3GS, the Star Spotter feature shows 
you a representation of the part of the sky your iPhone is pointed at! 
Move your iPhone, and the starfield moves with you! That’s just too cool!
Other features include the Pic of the Day, which is really the last several 
astronomy Pics of the Day. Choose a picture from the list, and if you are 
connected to the Internet via cell network or Wi-Fi the picture displays. 
Tap the i button, and you get detailed information about the image.
If you want to look up stars, planets, or constellations by name, you 
can do that, too. Just tap the magnifying glass when you’re on the

main screen, and a searchable list appears with tabs for different cat-
egories at the bottom. After you find the celestial object you want, tap 
it, and the star map re-appears, centered on the object you selected.
 
Some celestial bodies have Wikipedia entries. When you’re in the i 
information, tap the w button where one is available and the celestial 
body’s Wikipedia entry opens in Safari. 
You can spin the app about 180 degrees and look at a detailed globe of 
the planet Earth. The globe pinpoints your location and offers real-time 
information on the day and night parts of the planet. Tap the magnifying 
glass, and you can look up a specific city, complete with latitude and 
longitude, and then you can look at the sky from that city’s location. It’s 
just crazy what you can do with this app!
Lastly, there’s a built-in help function that gives you detailed information 
about how to use all the features this great app offers.
Best features 
Star Spotter is way, way too much fun, and I love being able to get 
information about the stars I can see right above me.
Worst features 
Due to the amount of information the app has to load, it takes several 
seconds to launch, but that’s not really much of a complaint.

 French 101 
 
$7.99 US
French 101 is part of a series of foreign language-learning apps for the 
iPhone called 24/7 Tutor. This series of apps includes French, German, 
Italian, and Spanish, and each language has four different levels: Free, 
101, 102, and 103. 
I looked at French 101 and Free French Tutor and found them to be 
solid, no-frills apps for learning French words (French 103 offers 
phrases). French 101 includes several categories of words or phrases 
and has four different modes for quizzing you on those words — rep-
etition is part of the learning process. You get a quiz grade when you 
complete each mode so you can track your learning.
The Free versions of the app include only 25 words and are really little 
more than a sampler that shows you the approach the developers use.
 HP 12C Financial Calculator
 
$14.99 US
This app is part super-useful for people in finance (where the HP 12C 
is still in use) and part blast-from-your-past for those of us old enough 
to remember when a handheld calculator cost as much, if not more, 
than an iPhone!
The HP 12C is a programmable calculator that enables you to enter 
long and complex formulas for values that are common in the financial 
industry (from loan payments to cash blow, to bond values, and much, 
much more).
The app version of this venerable calculator includes everything the 
original does and less — you can tilt your iPhone to get a simplified 
RPN calculator.
 Matches
 
Free
If you’re familiar with the card game Concentration, you know Matches. 
The great thing about the app, though, is that you don’t have to gather 
up and deal the cards each time! Matches is a simple matching game 
that has bright, simple illustrations. Kids are the target audience.

41
 Chapter 3: Education
Each game board has two of each letter, number, animal, or 
transportation-themed image, and the point of the game is to pair 
matching squares. The hitch, of course, is that if you choose two 
squares that don’t match, they turn back over — you have to 
remember where they are for future matching. The faster you 
make matches, the higher your score, and playing the game may 
improve your memory.
 
Math Flash Cards
 
$0.99 US
As the name suggests, Math Flash Cards is a flash card app for simple 
math (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It includes 
a multiple-choice mode, as well as numeric keypad entry for math fun 
that’s a little more challenging.
The app keeps track of how long it takes you to finish each level, 
which is a great benchmarking carrot for kids to try to beat. You can 
also set up new decks of cards, each with its own options.
The interface is clean and simple, and Math Flash Cards is useful for 
young children who are learning math.
 
To turn on the numeric keypad mode, click the arrow next to your 
deck and turn off Multiple Choice.
 Wheels on the Bus
 
$0.99 US
Wheels on the Bus is an interactive book based on the song of the 
same name. This app plays the song, and each stanza gets its own 
interactive page with elements you can poke or drag.
For instance, “The doors on the bus go open and shut” features doors 
you can slide open and close, with a bird you can see after the door is 
open. Very young kids will love Wheels on the Bus. 
The drawings are bright and colorful, and the app features several 
languages (including gibberish), instruments, and the capability for 
you (or your kid) to record the song yourself!

Acrobots
 
 
$ 0.99 US
The application description in the iTunes 
App Store for Acrobots says it’s a “mesmer-
izing, physics-based toy,” and I’ll be darned 
if I can think of a more accurate description.
The so-called acrobots (or “bots” for short) 
are multicolored, gelatinous, acrobatic crea-
tures with circle bodies and three slender 
arms that have suction cups at the ends 
(see the image on the left). The bots tumble, 
disconnect, reconnect, push off one another 
and the edges of the screen, and float 
around in a smooth, colorful ballet. 
By tilting or shaking your iPhone, you can make the bots move on 
their own based on the settings you specify (as shown in the figure 
on the right). You can also tap any bot to flick it in any direction; the 
faster you flick, the faster the bot moves.
The five icons shown (from left to right) at the top of the screen in the 
images on the next page perform these tasks:
 
✓ Plus sign: Adds a bot.
 
✓ Minus sign: Removes a bot.
 
✓ Light bulb: Turns silhouette mode on and off. In silhouette mode, 
the bots turn a dark shade of blue and the background changes 
from black to light blue. 
 
✓ Target: Opens the settings screen.
 
✓ Question mark: Displays the version number.
The settings screen, shown on the right, lets you control the physics 
that govern the bots’ movement. You have complete control over the 
bots’ size, balance, suction cup stickiness, and movement speed, as 
well as the effects of gravity and air drag.
Top Ten Apps
▶ Acrobots
▶ Backgrounds
▶ Brushes
▶ EyeTV
▶ Now Playing
▶ Koi Pond
▶ Lightsaber Unleashed
▶ Rising Card
▶ TMZ
▶ 2000+ Sounds

43
At the bottom of the screen are eight presets that control all six 
parameters at once. The setting I used in the figure on the right below 
is called Beasts; others include Teeter, Tumble, Spazz.
 
If you’re having trouble imagining what bots look like in motion, check 
out the Web-based Flash simulation of Acrobots at w ww.vectorpark.
com/acrobots. There you can add and remove bots, flick them, and 
adjust their speed. But because you can’t tilt or shake your computer, nor 
can you control individual physics attributes of the bots, the simulation 
isn’t nearly as cool as the iPhone version. Despite these shortcomings, 
it’s still a good demo of what bot movements look like. If you need to be 
convinced that this app is cool, give the demo a try. 
Best features
Acrobots is mesmerizing, fascinating, and, at least in my humble 
opinion, soothing. I can waste an inordinate amount of time flinging 
them around, shaking my iPhone to scramble them, and observing the 
effects different settings have on the way the bots move. The app is 
also great for showing people something “cool” on your iPhone. 
Worst features
I think the effect of Acrobots would be even more stunning if there were 
sounds associated with suction cups attaching to and detaching from 
other suction cups, but the app doesn’t include audio. That said, you can 
play music with your iPod while you play with Acrobots, which doesn’t 
have the same effect as app-specific audio would, but it’s still interesting.

 Backgrounds
 
Free
Backgrounds is an app that gives you access to more than 9,000 
mostly high-quality images you can use as wallpaper on your iPhone. 
For those of you who aren’t interested in customizing your wallpaper 
or iPhone Contacts photos, you might want to skip this app. However, 
if you’re still seeing the blue globe in the background because you 
didn’t realize you could put something else in its place, read on. 
The iPhone has always given you the capability to choose a custom 
wallpaper image. If you open the Settings app, tap Wallpaper, and then 
tap Wallpaper again, you can see that your iPhone includes 18 wall paper 
images in addition to the aforementioned blue globe. Alternatively, you 
can tap Camera Roll or Photo Library instead of tapping Wallpaper the 
second time and use any photo in your library as wallpaper. 
I love iPhone wallpaper and change mine often to fit my mood. Today I 
have a picture of an Aston-Martin DB9 that I’ve been lusting for; last week 
I had a snow leopard; the week before that I had the fabulous nature 
shot shown on the left. The one thing all three wallpaper images have in 
common is that I got them free with the Backgrounds app. 
You can search by keyword or browse the most popular and most 
recently added images by tapping the appropriate button at the top of 
the screen, as shown in the figure on the right. You can also browse 
in more than 30 categories, including Funny, Quotes, Love, Animals, 
Cars, Cute, For Guys, Artsy, Nature, Patterns, and Buildings. 
As you browse, the images are displayed four at a time, as shown on 
the right. Tap the left- or right-arrow buttons at the bottom of the 
screen to see the next or previous group of four images. When you 
find an image that looks interesting, tap it to check out a full-size 
preview, as shown in the image on the left. When you find an image 
you like, tap the Save button and the image is saved to your iPhone’s 
Camera Roll. To use the image as your wallpaper, launch the Settings 
app, tap Wallpaper, tap Camera Roll, and tap the image. Whenever 
you unlock your phone or talk to someone you don’t have a picture 
of, you see the wallpaper image rather than the blue globe or whatever 
other picture you previously had selected. 
44
Chapter 4: Entertainment 

45
When you’re browsing the images, if you tap the little asterisk button 
between the left and right arrows, you see a unique category of images 
called Frames. A frame is an image with a hole in it. You can insert a 
photo of yourself or anyone else into the hole in the image. Choose 
the photo you want to use and Backgrounds lets you move, scale, and 
rotate the picture to fit it in the frame. Presto! You now have a unique 
wallpaper image that integrates the person of your choosing. It’s a 
pretty cool idea and is nicely implemented here. 
With more than 9,000 background images and more added daily, the 
Background app ensures that you’ll never run out of fresh images to 
use as wallpaper on your iPhone. 
Best features
How can you not love a free app that provides thousands of free wall-
paper images, plus thoughtful touches such as Frames? 
Worst features
The app and wallpaper images are free, but the app isn’t free of intru-
sive ads, as shown at the bottom of both images. There are also a 
number of somewhat lame pictures in the app, but it’s not difficult to 
ignore them.

 Bru shes
 
$4. 99 US
Bru shes is a drawing and painting app designed exclusively for the 
iPhone. With a simple, elegant user interface, Brushes offers a pow-
erful toolset for drawing and painting — as you can see in the four 
sample images that come with the app, shown in the figure on the left, 
reduced to one-quarter size. 
Thoughtful touches abound in Brushes. Tap once anywhere on the 
screen to show or hide the toolbar. Zoom in as much as 1,600% or out 
to 70% with the iPhone pinch and unpinch gestures. Pick a color with 
a single press of your fingertip. 
The app is called Brushes, so the obvious place to start exploring is 
with the brush styles. The app has three types — smooth, fine bristle, 
and rough bristle — which are available in any size from 1 to 64 pixels 
and offer complete control over the opacity of your strokes. 
There’s a terrific color picker (shown in the figure on the right). To 
change the hue and saturation of the color you want to use for painting, 
drag the knob (a little white circle) around on the color wheel. Below the 
color wheel are two sliders. The top slider determines the brightness of 
the selected color and the bottom slider determines the color’s opacity. 
Many desktop graphics programs have an eyedropper tool to “pick 
up” any color in your image and paint with it. There’s an eyedropper 
in the Brushes toolbar, too, but I almost always use the shortcut of 
pressing my finger in one spot for half a second, which causes the eye-
dropper tool to pop up directly under my fingertip. 
Another cool feature of Brushes is its support for up to four layers. 
I’ve seen layers in many desktop graphics programs, but Brushes is 
the first iPhone app I’ve seen with ’em. Each layer can be painted inde-
pendently without affecting the layers above or below. You drag and 
drop to change the stacking order of the layers, which I find both ele-
gant and intuitive. You have full control over layer opacity, so you can 
use a semitransparent layer to tint all or part of the layer(s) below. 
And you can merge any of the layers with any other(s) at anytime.
Don’t worry if you make a mistake — Brushes has at least ten levels of 
undo and redo, so you can undo or redo your last ten (or more) actions. 
When you’re finished with your masterpiece, you can save it in the 
Brushes gallery so you can easily work on it some more or show it to 
your friends with the Brushes built-in slideshow. You can export finished 
pictures to your iPhone’s Camera Roll or use the Brushes built-in Web 
Chapter 4: Entertainment

server to view or download your creations over Wi-Fi with any Web 
browser on any computer. 
If you’re a Mac OS X user, there’s a cool free Brushes Viewer that lets 
you view or export your paintings on your Mac. Another interesting 
feature is that the Brushes Viewer can display a stroke-by-stroke ani-
mated replay of the making of your painting, which you can export as 
a QuickTime movie. Plus, the Brushes Viewer can export paintings at 
up to six times their iPhone resolution (1,920 x 2,880 pixels).
The best way to experience Brushes is to check out some of the work 
that’s been done with it. Take a look at the cover of the June 1, 2009 issue 
of The New Yorker (htt p://tinyurl.com/brushes-newyorker), 
which shows art created with Brushes by artist Jorge Colombo. Then 
watch this video clip from ABC News (htt p://tinyurl.com/
brushes-abc) and check out what other Brushes users have created 
in this Flickr group (http://flickr.com/groups/brushes). Finally, 
take a gander at what pop artis t David Hockney has done with Brushes 
(http://www.nybooks.com/features/slideshows/hockney).
Best features
The best feature of Brushes is its simple but powerful user interface. 
If you’re artistically inclined, there’s no limit to the things you can 
create with Brushes.
Worst features
The way-cool Brushes Viewer isn’t available for Windows.

 EyeTV
 
$4.99* US
The EyeTV app provides three awesome TV-related features. With it 
I can
 
✓ Use my iPhone to watch TV shows and movies I’ve recorded 
using EyeTV on my Mac without having to sync or transfer them 
to my iPhone
 
✓ Remotely start recording live TV or schedule a future recording 
on my Mac at home
 
✓ Watch live TV on my iPhone wherever I have Wi-Fi
Before you get too excited about EyeTV, know that there are a couple 
of provisos. See the asterisk next to the $4.99 price? It’s there because 
to use this app you must have the EyeTV software and hardware run-
ning on your Mac at home. The EyeTV hardware and software pack-
ages, which let you watch and record television programming on your 
Mac screen, cost at least $149.95.
 
Having had the EyeTV hardware and software on my Mac for many 
years — long before the iPhone was invented — I’ve felt it was worth 
every penny. Today I think that the EyeTV hardware and software on 
my Mac plus the EyeTV iPhone app may be the greatest combination 
since peanut butter and jelly. It’s an awesome combo even at $154.94 
($149.95 + $4.99).
I love watching video on my iPhone, especially when I’m stuck in a 
hotel room far from home. Before the EyeTV app, I had to stock my 
iPhone with any movies or TV shows I might want to watch in my 
hotel. Now I don’t have to do that. Instead, I just fire up the EyeTV app 
on my iPhone and choose from the hundreds of movies and TV shows 
I’ve recorded with EyeTV on my Mac, including dozens of episodes of 
The Family Guy, as shown in the figure on the left. I also have access to 
dozens of theatrical movies I’ve recorded.
Speaking of recording, the EyeTV app lets me start a recording at home 
or schedule one for the future. It includes a built-in program guide that 
shows me what’s on for the next 10 days. If there’s something I want to 
Chapter 4: Entertainment 

49
record, I just tap the Record button and the EyeTV system on my Mac 
records it. Shortly after the show ends, I can watch it on my iPhone.
Another cool feature of the EyeTV app is that I can watch live TV
anywhere there’s Wi-Fi. When I’m sitting at Starbucks enjoying a latte, 
I can watch the news live on any of my local TV channels or watch 
CNN, MTV, VH1, or any of the other 70+ channels available with 
EyeTV.
All these features add up to a fabulous TV experience on my iPhone. 
Best features
The best feature is using the EyeTV app on my iPhone to schedule and 
record TV shows on my Mac and watch them at my convenience on my 
iPhone. Though watching live TV on my iPhone is pretty darn cool, too.
Worst features
First, the app requires you to also have an EyeTV hardware and soft-
ware system ($149.95+). Second, EyeTV systems are Mac-only. And 
third, the app doesn’t work over 3G or EDGE, only over Wi-Fi.

Now Playing
 
Free
 A number of apps provide information about the movies playing in 
your local theatres. I’ve tried lots of them, and the app I keep coming 
back to is Now Playing. It has everything you need to help you decide 
on a movie, theatre, and show time. 
You can browse the movies playing in your area by title, release date, 
or rating, as shown in the figure on the left. I’ve selected ratings and 
reviews from Rotten Tomatoes (www.rottentomatoes.com), but 
you can choose to receive your ratings and reviews from Metacritic 
or Google. If you tap the arrow to the right of a ranked listing, you can 
read a description of the movie (see figure on the right).
If you tap the Theatres button at the bottom o f the screen, you can 
see movie theatres (instead of movie titles) sorted by your choice of 
the theatre name or distance from your current location. This feature 
is great when you’re out to dinner or visiting a friend across town and 
you want to find out what movies are playing at theatres nearby. 
Maps and driving directions are available for all theatres, or you can 
see an overview map that shows all nearby theatres at once. 
When you find a movie you’re interested in, with a single tap you can
 
✓ Watch its trailer
 
✓ Read reviews of it from a variety of print and online sources
 
✓ Have the theatres and show-time listings e-mailed to you
 
✓ View in Safari the Amazon, IMDb, Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes, or 
Wikipedia Web page for the movie 
You can even buy your tickets for many (but not all) theatres with a 
couple more taps. 
But that’s not all. Now Playing works with any network connection 
(Wi-Fi, EDGE, or 3G). After you’ve opened the app and downloaded the 
latest movie data, you can view the information again even when you 
don’t have a network connection of any type. 
If you’re a Netflix user, you have the capability to add movies to your 
Netflix queue right from the Now Playing app.
You can also browse through future movie releases sorted alphabeti-
cally by title or chronologically by release date.
Chapter 4: Entertainment 

51
Finally, you can browse new DVD releases alphabetically by title or 
chronologically by release date.
I use this app almost every time I’m thinking of going to a movie. I love 
being able to see all the movies playing nearby, ranked by their Rotten 
Tomatoes rating. It’s great to be able to watch movie trailers wherever 
I happen to be when the movie-going mood strikes me. Luckily, most 
of the theatres near my house offer online ticketing, so I can usually 
snag tickets in advance and avoid waiting in line or being disappointed 
when the movie I want to see sells out before I get there. 
The app is free and it’s great. If you like movies, you’ll love Now Playing.
Best features
All the features are great. Having movie listings with show times for all 
nearby theatres is handy, as well as being able to watch trailers and 
see movie reviews and ratings on your iPhone. Even though you can’t 
always buy tickets to a particular movie at a specific theatre, when 
you can buy tickets using your iPhone, it’s especially convenient.
Worst features
I honestly can’t think of a single bad feature. There aren’t even any ads 
to gripe about — unless you consider movie trailers to be ads. And 
even if you do consider trailers to be ads (because they are), they’re 
one of the very few types of ads I actually like to watch.

 Koi Po nd
 
$0.99 US
 Pictur e a beautiful crystal-clear pond with colorful koi fish swimming 
in the shallow water as you listen to the soft sounds of nature in the 
background. Next, imagine sticking a finger in the water and watching 
the water ripple as the koi dart away. 
Now picture what this scenario might be like on your iPhone, and you 
have Koi Pond. With myriad options, the app looks and sounds great, 
and it is surprisingly calming. You can set its sleep timer and allow 
yourself to drift off while listening to the soothing sounds of water, 
frogs, birds, insects, and rain.
Gorgeous, relaxing, and beautiful — what more could you ask from a 
99¢ app?
 Lightsaber Unleashed
 
Free
If you ’re a Star Wars fan or just someone who thinks lightsabers 
are the coolest weapon since the mace, you’ll love the Lightsaber 
Unleashed app.
You’ll thrill to the sounds of an actual Lightsaber as you swing your 
iPhone to and fro. The app even makes the right sounds when you 
turn your lightsaber on or off.
There’s optional Star Wars-like music and your choice of Force 
Unleashed characters (Darth Vader, Shaak Ti, Rahm Kota, and so on). 
In addition, you can choose the color and hilt style of your lightsaber.
It’s a silly app, but if you’re a Star Wars fan, it’s a must-have.
 Rising Card
 
$2.99 US
Ask a  friend to name any playing card. Tap the Rising Card icon and a 
deck of playing cards appears. Sprinkle some magic whiffle dust on it 
or say some magic words and then ask your friend to give the iPhone 
a gentle shake. Your friend will be amazed when his card floats out of 
the deck. 

53
 Chapter 4: Entertainment
The illusion is easy to perform; it works every time; and the secret 
(which, of course, I won’t reveal) is diabolical. 
 
Many people suspect the app works with voice recognition, but it 
doesn’t. A person can write down the card’s name instead of saying it 
aloud, and the illusion still works perfectly.
This is truly one of my very favorite apps. 
 TMZ
 
Free
The TM Z app has a single purpose: to deliver up-to-the-minute enter-
tainment news, photos, and videos directly to your iPhone. 
Its simple interface provides easy access to breaking entertainment 
news that’s updated 24/7, and it includes dedicated video and photo 
galleries and TMZ TV. 
This app takes celebrity gossip to a new high (or low). Rest assured 
that if a scandal breaks out anywhere in the world, you’ll hear about it 
first with the TMZ app.
Whether you’re a fan of TMZ.com, a celebrity gossip lover, a 
Hollywood glitz gourmet, or just someone who loves seeing dirt 
dished, you’ll love the TMZ app. 
 2000+ Sounds
 
$0.99 US
Yep, i t’s just what its name implies — an app with more than 2,000 
sound effects. These are not just any sound effects, though; they’re 
high-quality, professionally recorded sounds. 
The sounds are nicely organized in descriptive categories. You can 
also search for sounds by name. If you’re not in the mood for anything 
particular, there’s a random sounds button.
All sounds can be looped to repeat indefinitely, and you can create a 
list of your favorite sounds.
My favorite feature is the timer, which allows me to pick a sound and 
delay its start for as long as 120 seconds. Think of all the fun you’ll 
have with this feature . . . or not.
2000+ Sounds is silly and sophomoric, but it’s still kind of fun. 

5 Finance
 
Bank of Mom
 
 
$1.99 US
The Bank of Mom app has a great name 
and a great purpose, and I hope that lots 
of moms (and dads) take this app to heart. 
What this app does is allow parents to keep 
track of their kids’ bank accounts, or rather 
their kids’ virtual bank accounts. The app 
documents everything that comes into 
and goes out of those accounts, including 
deposits and withdrawals, why they were 
made, and interest accrued by an account. 
You can also get an e-mail of the transac-
tion history.
The point of the app, according to the 
developers, is to help parents teach kids 
what money is, where it comes from, where it goes, what it’s worth, 
and what it really means to earn interest on an account. Think about 
that for a second: How many of you know kids (or, for that matter, 
adults) who have no inkling of how to budget, where their money 
comes from and goes to, and exactly how a credit card works?
I’ve heard parents, and even news stories, talk about this very thing. 
The point of Bank of Mom is to introduce these topics to kids at an 
early age so that they have time to learn about budgeting before being 
tossed out into the world with a mailbox full of credit card applica-
tions. I think educating kids about money is a great idea, and I wish my 
mom had had a tool like this when I was a kid.
I really should mention that the Bank of Mom app enables parents to 
do the same sort of tracking with time. In other words, you can set up 
an account for watching TV or being on the Internet, with “deposits” 
for time earned (by doing chores and mowing the lawn, for example) 
and withdrawals for using that time.
Let’s look at how the app works. You set up one or more accounts 
in the main window. In the figure on the left (although the names 
are truncated in the screen shot), I have these accounts set up:

Samantha’s Savings Account, Timmy, and Timmy’s TV Time. The bal-
ance for each account is shown in the figure — $59.62 for Samantha, 
$449.88 for Timmy, and 15 minutes for Timmy’s TV Time. 
When I tap Timmy, I see the most recent three transactions, as you can 
see in the figure on the right. The top entry is a deposit for $30 from a 
loving aunt; the middle entry is the $20 he spent at the movies; and the 
bottom entry is the starting balance for the account. The current balance 
is in the reddish bar above the entries. The entries are easy to make, and 
there’s an optional description field you can use for a comment or other 
information. The whole app is easy to read and understand. 
 
Try entering an interest payment when your child is watching — seeing 
$8.92 in interest added to the account could provide a meaningful lesson.
Best features 
The best feature of Bank of Mom is really the concept itself, which is a 
simple way to track money (or time) in a way that makes it easier for 
kids to learn the value of money.
Worst features 
In the iTunes reviews, a lot of people complain about the lack of 
instructions (which are actually right there in iTunes), but I personally 
found the app to be intuitive.
       
 Chapter 5: Finance

 
Bloomberg
 
Free
If you want to watch your stocks but don’t have an E*Trade or other 
online brokerage account, you may want to consider Bloomberg, the 
self-titled app from the Bloomberg wire service. This app offers stock 
quotes, market information, and financial news.
Let me start with that last item: news. I’m one of those old-school guys 
who thinks that news is important, and Bloomberg really seems to 
know how to handle the news. The company offers some of the best 
financial news on the planet, and it has been expanding into other 
areas beyond the scope of this iPhone app. 
Bloomberg offers the news in a number of different ways. Of course, 
you can get company-specific news when you view a stock, but in the 
News tab, you can get a list of news headlines and filter it in more than 
a score of ways. For instance, when you first fire up the app, you only 
see Worldwide and Exclusive categories.  However, you can also list 
news according to most read, bonds, commodities, currencies, the 
economy, emerging markets, energy, funds, health care, insurance, 
municipal bonds, politics, opinions, and more. You can filter by 13 dif-
ferent countries. You can even get audio news right in the app, which 
is a killer feature, in my opinion.
There’s also a tab for Markets, which is shown in the figure on the left. 
The app includes the six exchanges and indices listed in the screen-
shot, as well as another 40 or so markets and indices from around 
the world. Note the last column, which is percent changed (% Chg). 
See the little orange triangle above the column? That triangle lets you 
toggle through options to see the change in terms of points and the 
time at which the numbers in the Last column were registered. If you 
tap an individual listing, say DOW JONES, the app opens up to a page 
that offers you just about everything you might want to know about 
that market’s performance for the day, as well as a short paragraph 
explaining what it is you’re looking at, which is very handy for those 
who don’t know. I am surprised, though, that the page doesn’t default 
to news (like it does for stocks), nor allow you to tap the news items 
for an explanation.
Speaking of stocks, with the Bloomberg app you can put together a 
list of stocks you want to watch. In the figure on the bottom right, I 
56
Chapter 5: Finance 

57
put in Apple, Microsoft, AT&T, and BlackBerry maker Research in 
Motion (I know, I know, but on the day I took these screenshots, that 
was the first company I could find that closed up, and I wanted you to 
see the differences in the way the data is shown). When you choose 
the stocks, you can enter how many shares you own and the price at 
which you bought them. To see the value of your holdings, tap the 
orange triangles at the top of the columns for some additional options.
Even with all its great features, the Bloomberg app is not the best app 
for monitoring the value of your portfolio. It is, however, a great way 
to monitor your portfolio’s day-to-day performance and to get general 
interest financial news and news relating to your stocks.
Best features 
The color scheme is easy to read and easy on the eye, and the features 
are all easy to use. If you want fast financial news, this app is for you.
Worst features 
When searching for companies to watch in your stock list, the app 
doesn’t give you an error when it can’t find any matches, which is totally 
unintuitive. I’d like it if some of the features were easier to find, too.

CompareMe – Shopping Utility
 
$1 .99 US
I’m writing this book in the midst of the worst economic downturn 
since the Great Depression, and I haven’t seen people be so tight with 
their money since the recession of the 1970s. In an economic environ-
ment like this, it certainly makes sense to shop smartly and do as 
much comparison pricing as possible.
These days, a lot of supermarkets make comparison shopping easier 
than it used to be by offering a cost breakdown (by the ounce or unit 
count) of most products. Not all stores offer that service, though, and 
sometimes you aren’t readily presented with the information you need 
to make good choices.
For instance, I like to buy whole coffee beans and grind them at home, 
and recently I’ve been enjoying brewing espresso with Italian Roast 
beans from Peet’s Coffee and Tea. I can buy the beans directly from 
the coffee shop for roughly $12.99 per pound; but then I noticed that 
a bag of the same beans at the grocery store is only $9.99!
After doing some research, however, I discovered that the grocery 
store bags are 12 ounces, not a pound (16 ounces). But I still didn’t 
know which was less expensive per ounce. And that, my friends, is a 
perfect example of when you need CompareMe!
As you can see in the figure on the left, by buying my coffee beans 
directly from a Peet’s shop, I can save two percent.
Oh sure, I could compare the prices by hand, but CompareMe makes 
these kinds of comparisons so easy, I’ve found myself using the app 
more and more often, which is making me a better shopper. In this case, 
I try to buy my beans directly from Peet’s whenever I can. Two percent 
here and two percent there definitely adds up over the long haul! 
 
Do you like tuna? I do! But, boy, the pricing on canned tuna can 
fluctuate wildly. And don’t be deceived by those larger cans. You’d 
think they would be cheaper by the ounce than the smaller cans, but 
CompareMe has shown that’s never the case unless the large cans 
are on sale. The same is often true about toothpaste, which surprised 
the heck out of me. Buying something in larger quantities is usually 
cheaper, but not always. So be sure to do your comparisons with 
CompareMe.
Chapter 5: Finance 

59
CompareMe offers a detailed breakdown for each comparison it does. 
In the figure on the bottom right, you can see a side-by-side compari-
son of the A versus B pricing in their respective sizes, along with a 
breakdown of the price in its smallest form, which in this case is the 
ounce.
CompareMe has built-in values for grams, milligrams, kilograms, 
metric tonnes, ounces, pounds, short hundredweight, short tons, 
quarters, long hundredweights, long tons, and pfunds. Yeah, yeah — 
I didn’t know what those weird measurements were, either, but 
a quick Google search showed me they are mostly shipping and 
customs terms.
Best features 
CompareMe is easy to use, and it provides quick comparisons when 
I’m doing my shopping.
Worst features 
I’d like to be able to compare more than two things at a time.

E*Trade Mobile Pro
 
Free*
In the beginning, trading of stocks was done between two people (men, 
usually, at that time) who would meet and buy or sell shares in a com-
pany. Then came the  Age of the Broker, a highly paid person whose 
biggest asset was access to a person with a trading seat on one of the 
stock exchanges. At some point after the Internet became mainstream, 
companies such as E*Trade took the place of the broker, offering the 
same sort of access at a much lower price because all the work was 
being done through computers instead of face-to-face or on the phone.
Today, if you have a computer with access to the Internet, you can 
effectively conduct your own stock transactions almost instanta-
neously. (Okay, a bunch of stuff is still being handled behind the scenes, 
but for all intents and purposes the transactions are instantaneous.)
Maybe instead of “today” I should have said “before the iPhone,” because 
with apps like E*Trade Mobile Pro, you can now use your iPhone to 
access just about every single thing that used to require a computer. 
You can buy and sell stocks and options, transfer money between your 
E*Trade accounts, set up or manage watch lists, monitor your orders, 
manage and receive alerts, monitor your portfolio, get stock quotes, and 
get news — all from within this well-designed and elegant iPhone app.
I’m telling you, it’s good to be alive today because an app like this was 
science fiction not so long ago.
Take a look at the figure on the left. What you see is the main Dashboard 
page, which offers quick access to all three major U.S. stock indexes 
(DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500), with options for viewing it for one day, 
one week, one month, three months, six months, one year, or two years. 
At the top is a side-scrolling panel for 15 different features, including your 
portfolio, the buying and selling screen, news, money transfers, and so 
on. The scrolling panel is smooth and works very well. At the bottom is 
a link to recent general interest financial news articles.
The figure on the right is an individual stock page, in this case for Apple 
Inc. (I know, I picked a rare losing day to take these screenshots.) On a 
stock page you get the most important information for monitoring the 
daily movement of a stock, including the last trade price (in this case, 
the closing price), which is color-coded for quick recognition (red for 
down, green for up, unshaded for no change). You also get current 
trading volume, the day’s trading range, 52-week high and low, and the 
current market capitalization (the value) of the company.
Chapter 5: Finance 

61
Below the summary are two convenient buttons: use the Set Alert 
button to notify you when a stock hits a designated price, and use the 
Place Trade button to go to the buy and sell window for this particular 
stock. Below these buttons is the news list of recent articles for this 
particular company.
As the asterisk next to Free above indicates, “Free” isn’t totally accu-
rate because most of these features also require an E*Trade account. 
Without an account, you can’t buy or sell stocks, maintain a portfolio 
of stocks, or get alerts. What you can do without an account, however, 
is get stock quotes, read company news articles, and see the stock 
indexes. 
 
If you do have an account, there’s a setting for whether your login 
information should be saved (be careful with that one!).
Best features
This app is like having a full-service stockbroker in your pocket! 
E*Trade Mobile Pro is easy to use and very, very well designed.
Worst features 
I can’t think of anything I don’t like about this app, and that’s saying 
something.

Economy
 
$0.99 US
Okay, I’m going to err on the esoteric side of things with this app, 
called Economy. Unlike most of the other apps in the Financial section 
of this book, Economy doesn’t really help you do anything or keep 
track of anything. Instead, it gives you easy access to more than 40 
American and Canadian economic reports — the kind of reports that 
you’ve probably heard mentioned in the news dozens of times but 
have never actually seen.
Why are these reports important? Some of us like to follow the kinds 
of things covered in them, either out of personal interest or for profes-
sional reasons. For instance, I know my editors and friends over at The 
Mac Observer need to reference some of these reports because the 
information contained in them might influence the stock markets. If 
you’re a businessperson, some of these reports might pertain to your 
livelihood, and being able to have easy access to them could help you 
make better or faster decisions. Of course, if you’re a numbers junkie, 
you might want to follow them just because.
So what kind of reports can you find in Economy? One example is 
the Manufacturers’ New Orders: Durable Goods report, which is pub-
lished by the U.S. Department of Commerce (actually, it’s compiled 
by the Census Bureau, which is part of the Commerce Department). 
This report is updated monthly and measures orders received by U.S. 
manufacturers for durable goods, which include major appliances, 
cars, and so on. This report is considered a key indicator of how the 
economy is doing.
Other reports are about industrial capacity, car sales, light truck 
sales, and more. The app includes several reports on employment, 
two charts for the U.S. national debt (a Gross report — and it is gross, 
as you can see in the figure on the left, which includes a chart show-
ing the annual deficit or surplus going back to 1949), five reports on 
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), reports on the housing sector, 
inflation, interest rates, and something called Money Aggregates that 
shows how much money is doing its thing in the economy. That’s not 
all; there are also another 11 or so reports dealing with trade between 
the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.
If you press the Help button on any individual report — I used the 
Help button for the Gross National Debt report in the figure on the 
right — you get a page that gives you the history of the report, where 
the report comes from, and, sometimes, what the report means.
Chapter 5: Finance 

63
Another interesting feature in the app is the filter on most of the 
charts that enables you to sort by president. I’m not venturing into 
politics here, but if politics is your bag, Economy allows you to pin 
something good or bad on whichever party you want. A second filter-
ing option enables you to view the charts with recessions marked in 
gray, or you can turn off all the shading information.
One last note, Economy pulls its data via the FRED (Federal Reserve 
Economic Data) API, which is offered by the St. Louis Federal Reserve. 
So, the raw report information is made available through this API, 
and the developers of Economy have taken the data and formatted it 
nicely for the iPhone.
Best features 
I love that Economy offers no-nonsense and quick access to some of 
the most important economic reports produced in the U.S., many of 
which can be a hassle to find.
Worst features 
I’d like to see an option to look at recent news stories that involve 
each report, which seems to me to be a no-brainer feature that I hope 
is added at some point. I’d also like to be able to rotate the reports to 
(and reformat for) landscape mode.

Balan ce
 
Free
Balance is a simple and direct ledger app for your iPhone. With it, you 
can manage an account, easily adding credits and deductions to that 
account. The entries are easy to make and options are included for 
naming the type of transaction, how much the transaction is, the date, 
whether it was paid or received, whether it has cleared, and any notes 
you want to add. The account can be exported to your Mac or PC as a 
spreadsheet or as a backup for Balance. 
 
You can make an in-app purchase of a Pro version of Balance that 
allows you to manage more than one account. The cost for the Pro 
version is $2.99.
 
BillMinder (Push)
 
$0.99 US
BillMinder (Push) is a great app that keeps track of your bills and 
alerts you when you have a payment due. The (Push) in the name 
means that the app can push those alerts out to you rather than 
making you check the app. The app exports information as a spread-
sheet, has backup options, enables you to mark a bill paid with one 
tap, and more. Note that if you activate the push capability, you must 
pay an annual fee in addition to the app price.
 
Rotate your iPhone when on you’re on the Bills tab, and BillMinder 
gives you a pie chart of all your bills!
 iXpenseIt
 
$4.99 US
This is another really terrific app that tracks your household or busi-
ness expenses. Each entry has a number of fields you can use, includ-
ing type, category, and subcategory (for instance Auto as the category 
and Gasoline as the subcategory), date, vendor, and more. You can 

65
 Chapter 5: Finance
take a picture with your iPhone to attach to the entry. The categories 
have icons for easy identification, and you can get several reports 
showing you exactly how much you spent, monthly totals and aver-
ages, pie charts, and much more. Your entries are even searchable. If 
you want to track your expenses, you’ll like this app. There is a free 
version (with fewer features) if you want to try before you buy.
 
Mint.com Personal Finance
 
Free
Mint.com Personal Finance is another app that ties into an existing 
online service. Mint.com is a personal finance site that tracks both 
your bank accounts and your expenses. With this app, you can set up 
monthly budgets and more. The company’s iPhone app enables you to 
use your iPhone to see and manage the information in your account. 
You can see your account balances, track your monthly income versus 
expenses, see your budgets in real-time (handy for knowing how much 
you can spend while you’re shopping), and even track your retirement 
accounts. You can also get monthly reports of your account activity. 
If you are a Mint.com user, you’ll want this app on your iPhone; and if 
you’re not, you may want to join Mint.com so you can take advantage 
of this excellent free app!
 
PayPal
 
Free
If you’ve ever bought or sold anything on the Internet, you probably 
have a PayPal account. With the PayPal iPhone app, you can manage 
your account and send money right from your iPhone. You can view 
your current PayPal balance, as well as your history filtered by either 
sent or received payments (or both). You can see whether a transac-
tion has been completed and what kind of transaction it was (such as 
Transfer, Payment, In Progress, and Bill). Sending money is simple, as 
long as you have the e-mail address of the account you want to pay. 
The only thing you can’t do with the PayPal iPhone app is change your 
account information.

  Dinner Spinner 
(Allrecipes.com)
 
 
Free (ad supported)
What’s this? A recipe for a salad using 
beef? That’s just crazy, right? I’m the first 
to admit I wouldn’t have readily thought 
about a salad with beef in it, but Dinner 
Spinner showed me the light, which you 
can see in the figure on the left.
Dinner Spinner is a recipe app that 
ties into the Web site Allrecipes (www.
allrecipes.com). It lets you take a slot 
machine approach to finding recipes, and 
what could be more fun? Dinner Spinner 
has three spinning reels, just like a slot 
machine: In this case, one reel is for the 
type of dish, one is for the main ingredient, and one is for how long it 
takes to cook. Shake your iPhone and get recipes matching the crite-
ria that end up on your reels. Sometimes you won’t find a match for a 
particular combination — who knew that dessert recipes pretty much 
never feature lamb? — but I’ve found that to be pretty rare so far.
When you hit a combo you like, tap the View Matches! button to be 
taken to the first recipe that matches your results. For example, you 
can find 114 main dish recipes for vegetables that can be prepared in 
45 minutes or less. And remember those beef salads? You can find 11 
matches that can be made in 45 minutes or less. Again, who knew?
Speaking of which, take a look at the figure on the right, which is the 
very first thing I spun on this app, Chuck Wagon Salad. It’s a bar-
beque beef dish served on a bed of greens. Tap the View This Recipe/
Reviews button and you’re taken to a page with the name of the recipe 
and a photograph of the finished dish, an ingredient list, a summary, 
and a list of step-by-step directions. In short, it’s everything you need 
to follow a recipe.
You can also find nutritional information, including counts for calories, 
fat, cholesterol, sodium, dietary fiber, and more. This is useful informa-
tion if you’re trying to watch what you eat. Below that are user reviews, 
which I like because you can’t always tell what a dish will really be like 
from the recipe.

Note that you need a connection to the Internet to use this app. Most 
of the information isn’t stored on your iPhone; instead, it’s pulled from 
the Allrecipes Web site when you need it.
You can obviously lock down one or more of the reels to limit your 
choices to a specific main ingredient or how long it takes to prepare. 
You can also manually move the reels to whatever category you 
want. Either option is convenient for finding a recipe to match what 
you have on hand, or maybe something you can throw into the slow 
cooker before you go to work. If the random thing doesn’t grab you, 
you can just search through the recipe list, too.
I’ve found the app to be most useful, however, when I use the random 
shake to find new recipes for things I’ve never even thought about 
cooking. However you want to use it, it’s fun, easy to use, and the reci-
pes are well written and (mostly) easy to follow. I say mostly because 
some recipes are obviously more involved than others.
Best features
This is a great-looking app that is easy to use. The recipes are many 
and varied, and most of the ones I’ve cooked have been tasty.
Worst features 
Not every recipe on the Allrecipes.com Web site is available in the 
app. Although I’m not sure exactly how many are in the app, the 
iTunes description says it has “thousands.”

 Fast Food Calories Hunter
 
Free
Do you have a fast food guilty pleasure? Mine is Long John Silver’s 
Chicken Planks. Yeah, that’s right, and I’m not (totally) afraid to stand 
up and admit it, either! They are tasty, especially when dipped in 
tartar sauce. (Hey, try it before you make that face. It’s pretty good.)
Of course, Chicken Planks aren’t necessarily all that healthy, but how 
many delicious things are? The reality is that for decades now many 
of us have managed to ignore those calorie and fat counts — not to 
mention the sodium! — but that’s been changing in more recent times 
as fast food chains have begun putting nutritional information in their 
stores or on their Web sites. It’s still been pretty easy to hide from this 
information, however, even as you’re downing another hush puppy.
That is, it was easy until the iPhone came out: As Apple says, “There’s 
an app for that.” In this case, a little app called Fast Food Calories 
Hunter offers nutritional information for 67 national and regional fast 
food chains, as you can see in the figure on the left. It also has basic 
information on a variety of diets, and a handy Google Maps tool for 
finding fast food near you.
So take a look at my old friend the Chicken Plank. Turns out that 
puppy has 140 calories per plank, 8 grams of fat, 20 milligrams of cho-
lesterol, and 480 milligrams of sodium! Ouch! That’ll teach me to look 
this stuff up: I haven’t even added in that tartar sauce (100 calories in 
an ounce, with another 250 milligrams of sodium).
 
Unfortunately, this is where I have to call a big timeout. It turns out 
that not all the info in this app is perfectly accurate. For example, as 
you can see in the figure on the right, Calories Hunter lists the sodium 
count for that Chicken Plank I keep harping on about in grams, not 
milligrams. The number is right (480), but the measurement is not. 
I almost read right over it without noticing it. But of course a single 
plank doesn’t contain 480 grams of sodium. That would be like a whole 
block of salt or something.
So why do I still recommend this app? It’s simple: Even if there are 
some mistakes in the data, the reality is that having all this nutri-
tional information in your pocket makes it easier for you to eat more 
healthily if you’re interested in that sort of thing. For instance, I found 
68
Chapter 6: Food, Cooking, and Nutrition 

69
that the Chicken Cobb Salad at Long John Silver’s has fewer calories; 
although it’s still high in sodium, it’s much less than a full Chicken 
Plank meal. In short, information is power. I just hope the developers 
get these inconsistencies and mistakes fixed sooner rather than later.
The map feature is another handy aspect of this app, especially when 
you’re traveling, or maybe just away from your regular haunts. Tap 
the Map button, and you are presented with a Google Maps view of 
your current location. If you tap the magnifying glass icon, you get a 
list of the restaurants this app tracks. Choose one, tap the Go button, 
and all the locations near you appear, represented by a red pin. You 
can also limit your results to locations that are within two miles, five 
miles, or ten miles of your location.
Best features 
Nutritional information from most of the major fast food chains, all in 
one convenient source — that’s handy!
Worst features 
Some of the information isn’t right! That would be a deal-killer if it 
weren’t for the overall usefulness of this app.

 Grocery IQ
 
$0.99 US
I like to shop. I’m not very organized about it, but I enjoy the experi-
ence. About the only thing I don’t like is when I forget some key ingre-
dient and have to go back for it. Fortunately, I recently discovered 
Grocery IQ, a shopping list app that is easy to use, supports multiple 
stores and lists, and has a database of 130,000 items for my shopping 
convenience.
To start a new list, tap the plus sign (+) button in the List tab, find an 
item, and you’re off to the races. You can add items from your Favorites 
or History by tapping the Add to List button at the bottom of the item’s 
entry page. In the figure on the left, you see a basic grocery list. Each 
item on the list is broken down according to the aisle or area in which 
it’s found, which is super-helpful when you have a big list. That way, 
you can pick up at one time everything located in a certain part of the 
store.
In my hypothetical shopping trip, I’ve already gotten eggs, so they 
were moved to the bottom of the list. See that green bar? It tells me 
that I have one item in my basket, and that I still have to get four more 
items. As items you’ve already gotten are moved out of the way, you 
have to do less scrolling to look at what you still need to buy, but 
if you do want to go over what you’ve already gotten, it’s still right 
there.
When you’re finished shopping, just tap the Checkout button and your 
list is cleared. No muss, no fuss.
Favorites are very handy for those items you often need to add to your 
shopping list: say, milk, bread, or maybe tuna. (Hey, I told you back in 
Chapter 5 that I like tuna, and I meant it!) You can add items to your 
Favorites by tapping the Add to Favorites button on an item’s entry 
page or by going to the Favorites tab, tapping the plus sign (+) button, 
and doing a search. When you find the item you want, tap it to add it.
The History tab contains everything from your already-completed 
shopping lists, so that you can easily add them to a new list or to your 
Favorites. In the figure on the right, items I’ve put in my Favorites are 
marked with a star, whereas items already on a current list are marked 
with a circle. That way, you don’t have to go back and forth between 
tabs to check what you’ve already put on your list.
Chapter 6: Food, Cooking, and Nutrition 

71
Another thing I like about Grocery IQ is the built-in Help feature. When 
you first open the app or select one of the tabs, a Help pane slides 
up and tells you how to use whatever you’re looking at. It’s all pretty 
simple, but just in case, the Help instructions can explain it to you. 
Just turn them off by tapping the Don’t Show Again button once you 
know what you’re doing.
 
Have a significant other who can’t shop to save his or her life? Make 
a shopping list and e-mail it to him or her, complete with the proper 
shopping aisles, and you’ll both be happier.
Lastly, Grocery IQ supports multiple lists and multiple stores. It 
defaults to just Grocery Store, but you can add other stores as you 
need.
Best features 
Grocery IQ is easy to read and easy to use, and setting up a list is 
fast — especially after you’ve done a few and have a History and 
Favorites to work from.
Worst features 
The predictive-typing search feature works well, but it’s slow.

 Lose It!
 
Fre e
I can’t believe this awesome app is free. Lose It! is part calorie-counter, 
part exercise-measurer, and part coach who knows how much you 
should be eating and exercising to meet whatever weight loss goal you 
might have. Lose It! adjusts those levels as you go, without you having 
to do anything more than enter what you’ve eaten and how much 
you’ve exercised. I used this app for some time, and I found it to be 
amazingly helpful in monitoring what I eat.
Here’s how it works. The Lose It! basic approach is to treat your 
daily caloric intake as a budget. If you weigh x pounds and exercise 
y amount and want to lose z pounds per week, you can take in only 
a particular number of calories to meet that goal. Simple, right? And 
seemingly obvious, but how many of us manage to follow that simple 
formula without some kind of help? Yeah, me neither. But Lose It! 
makes it easy to do just that, which is why I love this app.
To start, enter your weight, your goal weight, and your sex. Next comes 
your height and your birthday, which is really a polite way of asking for 
your age because as we get older, our metabolisms slow down. Lastly, 
the app asks how much weight you want to lose per week.
 
This is important, by the way, because there’s no convincing Lose It! that 
you can lose 5 pounds a week because . . . well . . . because you can’t! Your 
choices range from 1⁄2 pound to 2 pounds per week, but lower goals are 
more realistic. Oh, and talk to your doctor — a medical doctor, that is, and 
not Dr. Mac! — before embarking on any program to lose weight.
So, if I enter a current weight of 200 pounds with a goal of 180 pounds, 
my height and weight, and a plan to lose 11⁄2 pounds per week, Lose 
It! tells me I can hit my goal in three months and a couple of days. My 
calorie budget is 1,922 calories per day, which is really a lot of food as 
long as it’s not all chocolate cake and ice cream.
Now that I have my program in place, all I have to do is enter what I 
eat and how much I exercise. In the figure on the left, you see what 
I ate for my breakfast, lunch, dinner, and an after-dinner walk I took 
with my wife. I actually had a few calories left over in my budget as 
you can see near the top of the screen, which is not unusual. Every 
day’s totals will likely be a little over or under your goals.
What’s really handy, though, is that Lose It! remembers these meals 
under Previous Meals, as you can see in the figure on the right. That’s 
useful because most of us have a lot of repetition in our diet. It makes 
entering entire meals easy as time goes on.
Chapter 6: Food, Cooking, and Nutrition

Also, when you enter a food type, you can specify quantities, and if 
you’re eating something that’s not in the database, you can just add 
your own entry for it.
 
Foods in the Lose It! database include nutritional info, but you’ll have 
to use the Internet to search for calorie counts if you add a food item 
yourself. I’ve been able to find calorie information for just about every-
thing I’ve looked for, and many national chains even have nutritional 
information on their sites. 
You also log your weight as you go, and, as you lose weight, your calo-
rie budget decreases. That’s because, in general, you burn fewer calo-
ries when you weigh less. The app does those calculations for you. All 
you have to do is pay attention to what Lose It! tells you.
I’ve found that Lose It! makes it easy for me to focus on what I’m eating 
and how much I’m exercising. That alone may be the killer feature of 
this app.
Best features 
It’s easy to use and intuitive, and the database is extensive.
Worst features 
The database isn’t perfect, however, and I’d prefer not having to 
search for nutritional information elsewhere and enter it manually.

 Urbanspoon
 
Free (ad supported)
This is the big one, right? Urbanspoon was one of the first apps Apple 
showed in an iPhone app commercial, and what’s not to like about an 
app that can help you pick a restaurant? How many times have you 
spent 45 minutes playing the “I don’t know, where do you want to go?” 
game with your spouse, your friends, or your workmates? I hate that 
game, and I can’t even begin to tell you how much, but Urbanspoon 
can change that.
The basic idea of the app is to offer various cuisines, price points, and 
neighborhoods on slot machine reels. Shake your iPhone (or push 
the Shake button), and you get a random suggestion for where to eat. 
If you don’t like the result, shake it again. If you want to limit your 
options, say to a particular neighborhood or a type of food, you can 
lock the reels.
 
Check out the Filter button at the top right of the screen. You can limit 
your results to Only Popular restaurants and eliminate chains from 
your results. You can also set a maximum distance and search for spe-
cific meals (breakfast, lunch, and so on).
When you get a restaurant you like — Hey look! In the figure on the 
right, you can see that I got Chuy’s, one of my favorite Austin res-
taurants — just tap the name of the restaurant. In response, you see 
a screen with the restaurant’s address, phone number, the kind of 
restaurant it is, and a link to read reviews of the place. In the case of 
Chuy’s, you find a critic’s review from the Austin American Statesman, 
a blog post that mentions Chuy’s, and several Urbanspoon user 
reviews. There are also buttons for voting on the restaurant with a 
percentage score of how other users have voted, as you can see in the 
figure on the right. Very cool!
 
If you like or hate a place, make sure to write your own review, and 
think about the kind of things you find helpful in a review: “THIS 
PLACE ROCKS!” isn’t all that useful.
Back on the main restaurant information page, you can tap the phone 
number in the listing to call the place. If you tap the address, you are 
taken to the Google Maps app with that address plugged in so you can 
get directions.
Now, if you don’t want to leave your next meal to the fickle finger of 
Lady Luck, you can browse Urbanspoon’s database by neighborhood, 
Chapter 6: Food, Cooking, and Nutrition

cuisine, features (who delivers?), what’s popular, and even by nearby 
restaurants using your iPhone’s GPS and the recently added Scope 
feature. Tap the Scope button to get a Google Maps page with your 
location and tons of pins representing nearby restaurants. Tap a pin 
to find out what it represents. That’s pretty cool, in my opinion.
 
If you’re adventuresome, try limiting yourself to one shake and stick-
ing to whatever comes up. It could be awful, but you might also dis-
cover a new restaurant you wouldn’t have otherwise tried!
Urbanspoon also has a social networking element. You can connect to 
Facebook (www.facebook.com) to make posts from the app and see 
your News Feed from others who have also plugged their Facebook 
info into the app. You don’t have to do all that stuff if you don’t want 
to, but it’s there. That said, I’ve noticed that only one of my many 
Facebook friends has put their info into Urbanspoon.
Best features 
I love the Scope feature — it’s helped me discover new restaurants 
that I picked simply because they were close. 
Worst features 
You need to be connected to the Internet via a cell network or WiFi 
to use many of the features of this otherwise very cool app. You also 
won’t find every city in Urbanspoon.

 170,000 Recipes — BigOven
 
Free (ad supported)
This app serves as an iPhone-interface for BigOven (www.bigoven.
com), a recipe and cuisine Web site. You have to register to use it, but 
when you do, you get quick access to 170,000 recipes, as long as you 
have an Internet connection. You can rate each recipe, and there are 
features like Try Soon Recipes, the Leftover Wizard, What’s for Dinner, 
and the Random Recipe. BigOven has a lot of content, and if you’re a 
foodie already involved in the site, you’ll especially like this app.
Note that you can make an in-app purchase for $2.49 to use the app 
ad-free.
 Easy  Recipes — Food & Drink
 
$0.99 US
The Easy Recipes — Food & Drink app has some tasty recipes, includ-
ing a lot of cocktail recipes, and who doesn’t love a good cocktail 
with their roasted potato wedges? The recipes are divided into eight 
categories, and they’re searchable, too — the Search tab gives you a 
list of every recipe included, and typing in the Search field filters out 
only those recipes that contain your search term. This app also has a 
random feature that returns a random recipe when you make a whisk-
ing motion with your iPhone: A simple shake won’t cut it. You need 
the circular flick in your wrist motion!
 myStarbucks
 
Free
One thing I hear all the time is “I can never find a Starbucks when I 
need one.” Okay, I’m kidding. I don’t think that phrase has ever been 
uttered in seriousness, but the company does know how to make a 
good iPhone app. myStarbucks has a store locator (in either map or 
list format), a drink builder that shows you what’s in all those coffee 
drinks, information about Starbucks coffee beans and food, and a 
Favorites function for saving your favorite stores and drinks. Lastly, 
you can log into Facebook and Twitter (www.twitter.com) through 
the app to share your Starbucks experiences.

 Shopper
 
$0.99 US
Here’s another handy shopping list generator, which is one of the 
more popular categories in the App Store. With Shopper, you can 
easily add items from the included database, and all of those items are 
editable. Shopping lists are presented by aisle, and the aisle informa-
tion is also editable. There are different categories of lists, and you 
can specify different stores so each can have its own list. One of the 
nicest things about Shopper is that it is highly configurable through 
various options, including the theme, the way lists appear, the ability 
to designate a default store, and a lot more.
 ZAGAT TO GO ’09
 
$9.99 US
If you know and use the ZAGAT restaurant guide, you probably 
already have this app. If you don’t, however, you should probably get 
it! ZAGAT is one of the most comprehensive restaurant guides on the 
planet, and the iPhone app gives you access to all 40,000 (as of this 
writing) restaurant reviews, a GPS-enabled restaurant locator, the 
capability to search for restaurants according to multiple criteria, as 
well as restaurant recommendations. This is definitely a must-have 
app for foodies, and, unlike a printed guide, the app is constantly 
updated with new reviews. The only caveat is that there are fewer list-
ings for smaller cities and towns, so if you live far from a big city, this 
app may not be worth ten bucks. 
 
Note that you need a connection to the Internet to use this app 
because it pulls reviews from the company’s servers.

7 Games
 The Deep Pinball
 
 
$0.99 US
I own half a dozen iPhone pinball games, 
and the one I enjoy the most and find has 
the most replay value is The Deep Pinball.
 
 
Before The Deep Pinball 
came out, its developer’s first 
release, Wild West Pinball 
(99¢), was my favorite pinball 
app and is still a close second.
Good pinball games require supremely 
realistic physics and The Deep Pinball nails 
it. The way the ball moves around the table 
and interacts with bumpers and flippers is 
completely realistic and authentic. So realistic, in fact, that you can 
“shake” the table to influence the ball’s movement. And like a real 
pinball machine, if you shake too hard, you’ll tilt and lose your ball. 
Furthermore, I sometimes get so involved in my game that I use body 
English, thrusting a hip or shoulder forward as I shake my iPhone, 
which my wife finds hysterically funny.
Another hallmark of a great pinball game is great sound effects, and 
The Deep Pinball doesn’t disappoint. The sounds the ball makes when 
it bounces off a bumper, is hit with a flipper, or passes through a roll-
over, are spot-on and totally authentic.
One thing I hate about some pinball games is that they don’t let you 
know your current objective, what happens when you hit specific tar-
gets or rollovers, or what targets you should be aiming for right now. 
The Deep Pinball deals with that by offering a tutorial when you launch 
the game. It explains your objectives and offers detailed advice about 
specific features of the table such as the sunken boat, as shown in the 
figure on the left. Without this tutorial, I might have never realized that 
switching off the whirlpool opened up access to the sunken ship.
Top Ten Apps

▶ Real Racing
▶ Rock Band
▶ Tiger Woods PGA Tour
▶ Wor dsWorth
▶ Eliminate Pro
▶ iShoot
▶ JellyCar 2
▶ The Secret of Monkey 
Island Special Edition
▶ Trivial Pursuit

One thing that takes some getting used to is the moving camera used 
by the game. Although it occasionally pulls back to reveal the entire 
table at once, as shown in the figure on the right, most of the time, it’s 
zoomed in on the action and following the ball while showing only part 
of the table. It’s similar to what you see in the figure on the left, and I 
found it disconcerting at first. Fortunately, the game has been updated 
and you now have a choice of using a “live” (zooming and moving) or 
“fixed” (see the whole table at once) camera.
Although this game only costs a buck, a free version is also available. 
It’s called (what else?) The Deep Pinball Free. It only gives you one 
ball and won’t save your high scores. But if you just want to see if you 
like playing pinball on your iPhone and don’t want to risk even a buck, 
you should definitely give it a try.
Best features 
Great ball and table physics combined with killer sound effects make 
for a thoroughly enjoyable and realistic pinball simulation.
Worst features
It can get a bit repetitive with only one table (some pinball games have 
as many as four different tables).
       
 Chapter 7: Games

 Real Racing
 
$4.99 US
Doz ens of car race games are available for the iPhone, but Real Racing 
is the real deal. With 48 cars in 4 classes, 12 tracks, and 5 unique game 
modes, a career mode with 3 divisions and 76 events, plus multiplayer 
Wi-Fi support for as many as 6 racers, it’ll take you a good long time to 
master it. Heck, it’ll take you a good long time to unlock all the differ-
ent tracks and cars, let alone master it!
One thing I really like about Real Racing is that, unlike many other 
racing games, it offers a myriad of options for controlling your race-
car. You can steer by accelerometer (tilting the iPhone) or by touch-
ing the left or right side of the screen. You can accelerate either 
automatically or manually. And you can adjust the accelerometer and 
brake sensitivity. Because you can fine-tune these controls, playing 
Real Racing is a lot more fun than playing other games that offer fewer 
control options.
Another thing I like is the number of game-play options. For example, 
if you like racing against real people, you can compete against up to 
five friends over Wi-Fi. Or you can participate in one of the online 
leagues and advance to a higher division if you’re any good. I think it’s 
cool that league play is open only to players after they’ve achieved 
some measure of success in their Real Racing career, so there aren’t a 
lot of novices. This makes league play more enjoyable and challenging.
If you don’t want to race real humans, there is still a race mode for 
every occasion. If you’ve only got a few minutes, try a three-lap Quick 
Race against five computer-controlled drivers. Or choose to compete 
in a Time Trial, where your only opponent is the ticking clock. Finally, 
there’s the career mode, which is guaranteed to take you a long time 
to complete, with its 76 events. With new tracks and new cars that you 
unlock when you win, there’s always something new and you never 
get bored.
As you race, you can choose from two different views: the cockpit 
view, as shown in the figure, or an external “eagle eye” camera view, 
which follows your car from slightly behind and above it. And unlike 
some games, Real Racing allows you to switch views during races with 
a single tap.

The sound effects are great; the tracks are unique; and there are a 
variety of different driving surfaces such as asphalt, grass, gravel, and 
ripple-strips, each with its own effect on your car’s speed and han-
dling. The driving experience is quite realistic. A good example is that 
when you tap the brake, your car slows down, but it also downshifts 
to a lower gear and handles a little better.
 
One quick tap right before a sharp turn or chicane is better than 
pressing and holding or multiple taps of the brakes.
I recommended Real Racing when it first came out and was priced at 
ten bucks. At $4.99, it’s a steal. Just check out some of its reviews in 
the App Store. There must be a good reason for its 4.5 out of 5 star 
rating and thousands of positive reviews.
And best of all, there’s a free version with only one car called Real 
Racing GTI, so you can give it a try without risking a dime.
Best features
The best thing about Real Racing is that it delivers a lot of variety in 
its control options, tracks, cars, and race modes against both com-
puter and real opponents. 
Worst features
Occasional network errors can spoil online races.
 Chapter 7: Games

 Rock  Band
 
$9.99 US
Let me just start by saying that I think Rock Band is by far the best 
of the tap-to-the-beat style games available on the iPhone today. 
Don’t get me wrong — I mean no disrespect to the other tap-to-music 
games, including the tapulous offerings such as Tap Tap Revenge 3 
($0.99), Nine Inch Nails Revenge ($4.99), Metallica Revenge ($4.99), 
Dave Matthews Band Revenge ($4.99), Lady Gaga  Revenge ($4.99), 
and Coldplay Revenge ($4.99); Gameloft’s Guitar Rock Tour and 
Guitar Rock Tour 2 ($2.99 and $4.99, respectively); Epic Tilt’s TapStar 
Premium ($0.99); or any of the other games in this genre. The fact 
is that none of those games are bad. In fact, most of them are pretty 
good, and I was happy to play them until Rock Band arrived on the 
scene last winter.
Simply put, Rock Band is the most polished, most playable, most flex-
ible, most enjoyable game of them all. And, at least in my opinion, it 
includes the best songs and has more great songs available for in-app 
purchase. 
On the other hand, if you are somewhat price-sensitive, you may be 
happy with one of the 99¢ offerings. They’re not as good or as much 
fun, but they are one-tenth the price of Rock Band.
You can play Rock Band solo or jam with up to three other band-mates 
over Bluetooth. You can play guitar, bass, drums, or even vocals. 
And you can choose from three levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, or 
Difficult (which I think of as insanely, ridiculously, and massively hard, 
and my son calls, “not particularly tough”).
Explaining how the game is played is beyond the purview of this brief 
essay, but in a nutshell, you tap in the proper place at the right time to 
score points. The more successful taps you make in a row, the more 
points you get. If you’ve played Rock Band or Guitar Hero on an Xbox 
360, PlayStation 3, or Wii, you know the drill. The figure on the left is 
what you see if you choose to play the guitar or bass; the figure on the 
right is how it looks when you choose vocals.
The game comes with twenty songs, including “Hanging on the 
Telephone” (Blondie), “Simple Man” (Lynyrd Skynyrd), “We Got the 
Beat” (The Go-Go’s), “Hymn 43” (Jethro Tull), plus songs by Blink-182, 
Chapter 7: Games 

83
Smashing Pumpkins, Joan Jett, Motörhead, the Pixies, Steve Miller 
Band, and many more. When you master all these songs (good luck), 
you can purchase additional songs by Lenny Kravitz, Social Distortion, 
Devo, and others in two-packs for 99¢.
One of the biggest differences between this game and others like it is 
that in the other games, the sound doesn’t change if you miss a note. 
In Rock Band, you hear a distinct clunk and the instrument (or vocal) 
drops out of the mix, which makes Rock Band feel more authentic and 
truer to the Xbox/PlayStation/Wii games.
Best features
Rock Band plays and sounds just like the console versions of Rock 
Band and Guitar Hero.
Worst features
For me, the biggest letdown is that, unlike the console versions of 
Rock Band, you don’t actually sing in this iPhone game. Although 
you can choose to play as the vocalist, instead of singing, you tap the 
screen. I suppose that’s good for the people around you when you’re 
playing, but I found it disappointing.

 Tiger Woods PGA Tour
 
$9.99 US
I loved t  he Electronic Arts Mac version of Tiger Woods PGA Tour and 
played it until my fingers bled. I love the iPhone version almost as much.
The graphics and level of detail are incredible, as good as I’ve ever 
seen in an iPhone game, as you can see in the figure. Notice all the 
information the screen offers, while at the same time providing a beau-
tifully detailed view of the fairway. Here’s what it all means (moving 
clockwise from top left):
 
✓ Top Le ft: Golfer name and bankroll
 
✓ Top Center: Wind speed (6 mph) and direction (silver triangular 
“tail” on the “6”)
 
✓ Top Center: Optimal swing strength (94%) and elevation (landing 
area 1 yard lower than the tee box you’re hitting from)
 
✓ Top Right: Hole number and par for hole
 
✓ Bottom Right: Where you are (tee) and your lie (100% = perfect)
 
✓ Bottom Right: Show overhead view (circle that looks like a target)
 
✓ Bottom Center: Show swing meter (little golfer silhouette in circle)
 
✓ Bottom Left: Distance to hole (383 YDS); Swing type (Full in 
this picture; other types include Flop, Chip, and Putt); and club 
selected (3 Wood).
The user interface is fantastic, and the touch-and-drag swing system 
is a brilliant example of designing controls specifically for the touch 
screen. First of all, it requires the proper up and down rhythm and 
speed. You can make the ball hook or slice by curving your upward 
swipe to the left or right. And when the ball is in the air, you can put 
spin on it by swiping madly across the screen in the direction you 
want the ball to spin. It’s easy to master and makes you feel you can 
hit the ball quite accurately. And most of the time, you can, which 
makes it a lot like real golf.
Putting is also nicely designed. Your caddy gives you tips that can help 
you putt more accurately and there’s also a “caddy cam” that shows 
exactly where your putt is going to go. You have to be careful when you 
use it, however, because you only get to use it once per green.
The game includes seven world-famous golf courses, including Pebble 
Beach, TPC Sawgrass, and St. Andrews, and you can visit the in-game 
Chapter 7: Games 

85
pro shop to purchase additional courses, including Hazeltine National 
Golf Club, for 99¢ each.
You can play a s a top golfer such as Annika Sorenstam, Vijay Singh, 
and, of course, Tiger Woods, or just be yourself. And you can use 
the money you win in tournaments to purchase better golf gear that 
can give you more power, better control over spin, drives, or putts, 
improved approach shots, and so on.
While the real-time play-by-play commentary by former pro golfer Sam 
Torrance and the Golf Channel’s Kelly Tilghman adds a certain sense of 
drama, it also gets a bit repetitive after you’ve played 30 or 40 rounds. 
Fortunately, you can control the volume of the commentary, sound 
effects, and music.
If you like golf or just enjoy a beautifully designed iPhone game, Tiger 
Woods PGA Tour is a bargain at $9.99.
Best features
Tiger Woods PGA Tour is not only a lot of fun, but it has superb graph-
ics and audio, as well as one of the finest touch screen game interfaces 
ever. It’s easy to learn and difficult to master, which is just the way a 
game should be.
Worst features
If you quit in the middle of a round, the game sometimes fails to 
record your score for the last hole you played.

 WordsWorth
 
$1.99 US
As a writer , I love a good word game, and one of my favorites is 
WordsWorth. In this game, you form words by tapping letters on 
the screen or dragging your finger through letters to spell a word. 
Longer words using rare letters such as J, Z, and Qu, score more 
points than shorter words with more common letters, such as A, E, 
and O). There is also a bonus buzzword at the bottom of the screen 
in a yellow starburst, like ska in the figure on the left or yin in the 
figure on the right. Spelling a buzzword scores a lot more points 
than the word’s usual value. For example, because ska and yin are 
buzzwords in the figures, they’re worth a whopping 536 and 736 points, 
respectively. If they weren’t buzzwords, neither would be worth more 
than about 200–250 points.
To make things interesting, special tiles including blue wild cards, 
green bonuses, and red timers all appear, as shown in the figure on 
the left. The timer tiles are the most insidious; if the clock runs down 
before you’ve used the letter, you lose.
WordsWorth has two game modes. The original (Classic) mode 
doesn’t have a fixed time limit. Instead, it’s level-based — each time 
you achieve the prescribed number of points, you advance to the next 
level. And, of course, the levels grow increasingly harder with more 
timed tiles, fewer vowels, fewer wild cards, and more hard-to-use con-
sonants (such as z, x, and q).
The timed mode gives you a fixed length of time to finish each level. If 
you don’t score enough points to advance to the next level before time 
runs out, you lose.
In either mode, if you can’t find any more words on the screen, you 
can shuffle the tiles by shaking your iPhone or tapping the little dude 
at the bottom left corner of the screen. But be careful; only a limited 
number of shuffles are available for each level, and using a shuffle 
almost always generates at least one timer tile and sometimes more 
than one.
The game has numerous options that let you increase or decrease its 
difficulty. You can choose grid sizes from 4 x 4 to 7 x 7. The figure on the 
left shows a 7 x 7 grid; the figure on the right is 4 x 4. You can also select 
Chapter 7: Games 

87
a minimum word size (3, 4, or 5 letters), number of scrambles 
available per level (0, 1, 2, or 3), timer length (10–90 seconds), and 
word list dictionary the game uses (TWL, SOWPODS, or ENABLE).
Although WordsWorth is simple, it’s engaging and addictive. But don’t 
take my word for it. Although it only costs $1.99, a free version also 
exists — WordsWorth Lite — so you can try it before you buy the full 
game. Both versions are the same in every way except the Lite version 
is limited to three levels, versus twenty in the paid version.
I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out that there are a lot of terrific word-
based games available for the iPhone. A couple of others you might 
enjoy are Wurdle ($1.99) and WordFu ($0.99).
Best features
WordsWorth is easy to learn, difficult to master, and extremely addict-
ing. And if you have to quit in the middle of a game, you can pick up 
where you left off the next time you play.
Worst features
None. I’ve wasted an awful lot of time playing this game and I don’t 
have a single complaint.

 Eliminate Pro  
 
Free
Eliminate Pro is a really good multiplayer first-person shooter. The 
graphics are excellent and the storyline is engaging. It has numer-
ous unique arenas, each with a different look and terrain, plus a wide 
variety of weapons and armor, and power-ups galore in every arena. 
You can challenge friends via Push Notification and they can join your 
game with a single tap. You can play alone against robots, or use the 
built-in matchmaking system to find opponents over 3G or Wi-Fi.
The good news: It’s free. The bad news: Upgrades take a long time to 
earn but are available for in-game purchase at prices ranging from rea-
sonable to ridiculous.
 iShoot
 
$1.99 US
iShoot is your classic tank versus tank game with more than 30 
different weapons including shells, missiles, cluster bombs, and nukes. 
Battling on beautiful photorealistic landscapes, iShoot can be played 
alone (against the computer), by two to four people over a Wi-Fi network, 
or by two people via pass-the-iPhone style “hot seat” play. It offers a 
rule editor and a weapons editor that allows you to tweak the game 
parameters to your satisfaction. It’s a lot of fun for less than two bucks.
If two bucks is too much to risk, check out iShoot Lite, a free version 
with fewer weapons (6 out of 25) and no photorealistic landscapes.
 JellyCar 2
 
$0.99 US
JellyCar 2 is a puzzle game with more than 30 devious levels and 3 
modes of play. The object is to guide a squishy car (hence the title) 
over ramps, wheels, levers, and other obstacles to reach the exit to 
the next level. It offers great game physics and a playful hand-drawn 
look, but it’s hard to explain in 100 words. Just trust me on this one: 
It’s totally addictive and lots of fun to play. There is no free version to 
try, but it only costs 99¢ and is made by Disney Interactive. ’Nuff said.

  The Secret of  Monkey Island 
Special Edition
 
$7.99 US
If you were a computer gamer in the early ’90s, you probably have 
fond memories of playing The Secret of Monkey Island from George 
Lucas’s LucasArts game company. The iPhone Special Edition is a 
faithful re-creation of that ’90s classic, which follows the humor-
ous swashbuckling misadventures of wannabe pirate Guybrush 
Threepwood as he attempts to become the most infamous pirate in 
the Caribbean. After nearly 20 years, the dialogue has lost none of its 
wit and the artwork has lost none of its snarky charm. If you liked it 
back then (or even if you weren’t born back then), it’s a unique and 
enjoyable iPhone game.
 Trivial Pursuit
 
$4.99 US
If you’ve ever played the Trivial Pursuit board game, the iPhone ver-
sion is a lot like the original, with thousands of different questions in 
six categories: Arts & Literature, Geography, Sports & Leisure, History, 
Entertainment, and Science & Nature. The big differences are that it’s an 
app, it fits in your pocket, it doesn’t have a game board or tiny plastic 
pieces to lose, and it only costs five bucks.
It has great graphics and challenging questions and you can play alone 
or with up to four players via Pass ‘N’ Play or Wi-Fi.

Do you drink enough water? The fact is that 
most of us live in at least a somewhat dehy-
drated state. All those sodas and other 
sugary drinks (did you know that “drink” or 
“cocktail” in a juice product’s name means 
that it has sugar or corn syrup added to 
it? It’s disgusting!) does not a properly 
hydrated person make.
I found all kinds of information about this 
on the Internet. Not drinking enough water 
can lead to excess body fat build-up, keep 
your organs from functioning properly, 
and, for a bit of irony, even cause you to 
retain water. Not drinking enough water 
when you’re trying to lose weight can supposedly even make it harder 
because your body can’t metabolize fat as fast as it could if you were. 
So, drink enough water and get a faster metabolism.
 
This seems like a good time to insert my reminder that despite being 
called Dr. Mac, I am not a medical doctor! That means that as smart 
as I am, you should discuss things like how much water you should be 
drinking or any kind of exercise program with your other doctor, the 
one with M.D. after his or her name.
So back to the issue of actually drinking all this water! How much 
should you be drinking? A normal, healthy person should be drinking 
eight glasses of eight ounces of water per day. I found some sources 
that suggested that you should add another eight ounces of water for 
every 25 pounds above your ideal weight you’re carrying around. For 
me, that probably means I should be drinking nine glasses of water.
Great! Now that you know this, it should be an easy matter of just 
doing it, right? Well, if drinking this much water represents a change in 
lifestyle for you, you’re probably going to need some help remember-
ing how much water you’ve drunk from day to day, and that’s where 
Eight Glasses a Day comes in. This is a super-simple app that displays 
a table with eight full glasses of water. When you drink a glass in real 
life, tap the virtual glass and watch it empty. In the figure on the left,

you’ll see that I’ve been a good boy and drank half my water for the 
day. When you’re done, the screen changes to a congratulatory mes-
sage and you can tap Start Over the next day.
“But Dr. Mac,” I can hear you asking, “you said you need nine glasses 
a day, and I’ll be honest, maybe I should be drinking nine, too. What 
good is this app for me?” Did you think Dr. Mac would steer you 
wrong? Nonsense! Eight Glasses a Day can be set to track from one to 
twelve glasses per day, as you can see in the figure on the right below. 
You can also set it to automatically start over at 12 a.m. and to show 
you your remaining count in the app icon. I recommend doing that 
because it becomes a reminder to drink some water whenever you see 
the app on your iPhone.
Eight Glasses a Day is a simple app for a simple task, but a task that 
many of us find hard to do and hard to track. As it might make a sig-
nificant difference in your overall health, give it a try.
Best features
What I like about this app is its pure simplicity. It literally could not be 
any easier to track your water consumption.
Worst features
It costs 99¢, which is a lot in the App Store ecosystem for such a 
simple app, but the benefits of helping you drink enough water are 
worth a lot more than a buck.

 i Exercise
 
$1.99 US
You know, if Apple made a nickel every time someone put an “i” in 
front of a product name, Steve Jobs would be a rich man. Oh, right, he 
is a rich man. In any event, here we have an exercise tracking app that 
is, fittingly, called iExercise. This app takes the approach of measur-
ing how many calories you want to burn from exercising, how far you 
want to walk or run, or how long you want to work out. This is a bit 
different from the approach of Lose It!, which I talk about in Chapter 
6, but that’s one of the great things about having all these apps: 
Somewhere out there is probably an app that does what it does in the 
way that you want to do it.
One of the things I like most about iExercise is the interface. It’s well 
designed with easy-to-look-at graphics and colors. I’m a sucker for a 
well-designed interface, and this one definitely qualifies.
In the figure on the left, you’ll see the main screen. This is your gate-
way to monitoring everything you’ve already done this week and to 
adding new exercise time. You’ll see that I burned 684 calories by 
exercising compared to my goal of working off 1,000 calories, that I’ve 
logged 1 hour and 27 minutes, 3 minutes shy of my goal, and that I’ve 
walked 4.7 miles, just a little shy of my weekly goal of 5 miles. It looks 
like another walk or two, or maybe mowing the lawn, will push me 
over the finish line. (Okay, so I cheated a bit, and I mowed the lawn 
before I sat down to write up this app.)
To enter an exercise, tap the Add Exercise button. There’s a fairly com-
prehensive list of exercise activities, everything from a treadmill run to 
playing soccer to mowing the lawn. I chose mowing the lawn, and on the 
next screen entered how many minutes it took me (31 minutes today). 
That brings me to the burger tab you can see in the figure on the right, 
where you enter calories. iExercise works by doing the calculations 
for you based on its own internal algorithms, but you can adjust that if 
you somehow know better. It’s too easy to cheat there, so I recommend 
leaving the calories consumed to wherever it defaults. After you save 
your information, you’re taken back to an updated main screen.
Other features of iExercise include a super cool Achievements screen 
where you can see various feats you might have accomplished. For 
instance, if you’re a cyclist, you’ll get an Achievement for your first 
92
Chapter 8: Healthcare and Fitness 

93
1,000 calorie ride (on up) and there are achievements for burning 
X amount of fat. Runners and cyclists get Achievements for how far 
they’ve traveled in total (like, “Traveled Across Oahu — 44 Miles”) 
and for individual events (like your first marathon or your first half-
century ride). Achievements are doled out by the app, and the only 
way to cheat is to fake an entry, so when you hit an Achievement, I 
bet it feels good. I say “I bet it feels good” because I haven’t yet hit an 
achievement, but I’m working on it!
All your entries are editable, and iExercise tweets your daily accom-
plishments and Achievements if you enter your Twitter information. It 
also tracks your weight and gives you a graph of your progress as time 
goes on.
Best features 
iExercise is easy to use and has a great interface.
Worst features
You can only enter your weight for today, so there’s no way to enter 
your weight from the past if, say, you were tracking your weight 
before you bought the app. The app could also use a metric option for 
those living in metric countries.

 iTreadmill: Pedometer Ultra 
 
with PocketStep
 
$0.99 US
This is a great app! The developers bill iTreadmill as a “virtual treadmill,” 
but it would be more accurate to think of it as a very capable pedometer. 
Now, I’ve gotten a few blank looks when talking to people about a pedom-
eter, so let me explain it right from the top: A pedometer is a device that 
measures your steps when you’re walking or running.
iTreadmill measures your steps with your iPhone by interpolating the 
accelerometer data from your phone. This is awesome if you’re into 
running or walking because it’s one less device you have to carry!
The app measures distance, time, pace, speed, calories, step count, 
and strike rate, and it can display any five of these at the same time. 
In the figure on the left, I’ve got it in the default configuration of 
showing my time up top. Time is repeated below, but each of these 
displays rotates through the seven parameters with a tap, making 
the display entirely customizable to your needs. That’s a nice touch.
 
If you’re really serious about measuring your walking or running dis-
tance more precisely, you should calibrate iTreadmill to your stride. 
Just tap the Cal button on the Treadmill tab for directions. This 
involves using the app while you walk or run a specific number of feet 
(about three miles, and it’s different for walking and running).
In addition to measuring your pace, iTreadmill also gives you a beat to 
help you hit a certain pace. In the figure on the right, I’ve touched the 
virtual scroll wheel control to the right of the main display button, and 
that allows me to set my target speed (you can change it to metric kilo-
meters in the Settings tab, where there’s also a setting for changing it 
to target pace instead of speed). Now, when I tap the Play button, in 
addition to measuring my steps, it plays a click sound for how fast I 
should be walking or running to hit the pace I want to maintain.
 
If you like listening to music when you’re walking or running, but you 
also want help setting your pace, you can turn off all the sounds and 
just reference the light around the Pacer display. Your mileage will 
vary on how well that works — pun intended — but it’s a nice option 
to have.
Chapter 8: Healthcare and Fitness 

95
Other key features of this app include a History tab with all the sessions 
you’ve saved (for those who like to track and measure their progress), 
and the capability to autopause when you stop walking or running, 
which you can turn off if you want. And if you want to measure your 
calorie expenditure, enter your weight in the Settings tab.
I tested out the app with it in my hand. If I’m listening to music when I 
walk, I like to have my iPhone out — I don’t know why, maybe it’s so 
I can change the song at a moment’s notice. In any event, iTreadmill 
seemed pretty accurate to me, but the makers said they’ve also mastered 
the art of interpolating the accelerometer data when the iPhone is in your 
pocket (they call it PocketStep) for those who like to tuck their iPhone 
away when they walk or run.
Best features
iTreadmill offers a great interface, and it’s easy to use. If I were a betting 
man, I’d bet the developers made the app they want to use, which is 
often the key to good software.
Worst features 
There should be some different options for hearing different sounds for 
the pace. Instead of a click, I’d prefer maybe something like a thump.

 WebMD Mobile
 
Fre e
Step right up! Step right up! We’ve got your basic medical information, 
positively free, positively like having a medical doctor in the palm of 
your hand! Okay, that last bit may be taking things a bit too far, but 
WebMD’s online database of medical information is fairly extensive, 
and the company’s iPhone app makes accessing that information 
pretty easy.
WebMD lets you look for information in three basic ways: Symptoms, 
Treatments, and First Aid. Start with Symptoms. See the naked guy in 
the figure on the left? He’s the launching pad for the Symptoms tab. 
Tap the part of the body that you have a question about, and you’re 
presented with a screen that lists various symptoms specific to that 
body part. Choose a symptom, and you’re taken to another screen 
that lists symptoms. This might seem redundant, but if you go back 
and tap another symptom, you’ll see that both symptoms are listed 
together. This makes it easy to go back and forth between multiple 
symptoms if needed, and if you want to remove one, tap the red circle 
with the minus sign in it, and then tap the Delete key.
After you have selected the symptoms you want to look up, just tap 
the View Possible Causes button below the list and you’ll get a new 
screen with one or more conditions that might cause your symptom 
(or symptoms, if you’ve added more than one to your Symptoms list). 
This isn’t a substitute for a doctor’s diagnosis, of course, but the infor-
mation might be helpful to you.
There is also a button for Skin and General, which are two more ways 
to look up your symptoms and are unrelated to the Ken doll figure. 
Both buttons take you to a list of symptoms, where you otherwise 
navigate as above.
Move right along to the Treatments tab. Now, as far as I can tell, 
this feature could have been called Pharmaceuticals 101. But I guess 
Treatments sounds better. In any event, WebMD has detailed infor-
mation about some 200 drugs, including warnings, uses, side effects, 
precautions, interactions, and overdose information. And when I say 
detailed, I mean detailed! As you can see in the figure on the right, you 
can even identify a drug by its shape and color, or its imprint. Most of 
us might never need to be able to do that, but if you do, you’ll be glad 
you had WebMD handy.
Chapter 8: Healthcare and Fitness 

97
The last major feature of this app is the First Aid tab. As you prob-
ably already figured out, it has basic first aid information for 30 or 
so injuries, such as burns, bruises, dizziness, shock, and so on. That 
information is divided into Self-Care at Home, Medical Treatment, and 
links to additional online information. The first two explain when you 
should use either, and how to do so. It’s written in easy-to-understand 
English, and I was impressed with what I read.
Now, hopefully you’ll never need the information WebMD offers, 
which is why this may well be one of those apps you never appreciate 
(or miss) until and if you do need it.
Best features
Extensive medical information on your iPhone!
Worst features
The Symptoms lookup feature uses a hodgepodge of iPhone inter-
faces, and I found that to be a little annoying — I’ve always been a big 
fan of consistency!

 White Noise
 
$1.99 US
White Noise is one of those apps that you’ll really appreciate when 
you need it. Its raison d’être is to provide background noise for you, 
something a lot of people want or need when they’re going to sleep or 
just in search of some relaxation.
White Noise offers 40 different sounds, all of which are very high qual-
ity samples. That means they sound good, which is important in that 
making noise is all this app is intended to do. For instance, you have 
the title track “White Noise,” as well as “Brown Noise,” “Pink Noise,” 
“Blue Noise,” and “Violet Noise,” each of which offers a different char-
acteristic to the static sound you might get from a television channel 
or radio frequency without a broadast. 
 
If you aren’t familiar with the term “white noise,” ask your parents. In 
this age of cable TV and iPods, a lot of young people might never have 
encountered white noise from an empty channel!
White Noise offers more than just static noise, however; it also includes 
sounds from the Amazon, ocean and beach noises, crickets, a crackling 
and popping campfire, several different kinds of rain, a thunderstorm 
(see below for more information on a dedicated storm version of the 
app), running water, dripping showers, sprinkler sounds, city noises 
(which is good for you city slickers on vacation in the country), a 
dishwasher, a hairdryer, blowing winds, oscillating fans, a wonderful 
grandfather clock ticking, beautiful chimes, an amazing Tibetan singing 
bowl, a heartbeat, frogs, a clothes dryer with a quarter bouncing around 
in it (who could sleep with that going on?!), my wife’s favorite, which is 
a cat purring, and many more. To navigate the sounds, you can either 
flick with a swipe of your finger, tap the arrow buttons at the top of the 
screen, as you can see in the image on the left, or see them in list form 
by tapping the Catalog button.
Each sound comes with an image for quick identification, but that image 
is static. I wish the app had something more to look at it, but that’s just 
me. Each sound also has a volume slider right there on the screen for 
making quick adjustments. That’s a small touch, but a handy one.
Other features include a timer for turning the sounds off at a specified 
time or in a specified amount of time, or starting an alarm. The set-
tings also include the capability to have the app quit when the timer is 
reached, which is very handy for battery life. You can also adjust the left-
right balance and the overall pitch of the sound sample. Lastly, there’s an 
ugly digital clock overlay, as you can see in the image on the right.
Chapter 8: Healthcare and Fitness 

99
If you want to try the app, check out the free Lite (ad supported) ver-
sion that is limited to ten sounds and doesn’t have the alarm or favor-
ites toolbar.
If you’re a fan of storm noises, there’s a version called White Noise 
Storm for 99¢ that lets you customize your storm! The app offers 
slider controls for Rain (Distance and Intensity), Thunder (Distance 
and Frequency), Wind, and a Master slider for overall volume. Unlike 
the original app, this version also offers some visual effects that match 
the settings you’ve chosen, although they’re limited to just the top 
part of the screen.
 
Try the Random option for White Noise Storm for a storm with chang-
ing characteristics.
Best features
Awesome sound samples make these noises sound great through your 
headphones or the iPhone’s internal speaker. I love the Tibetan sing-
ing bowl, but my favorite has to be the chimes.
Worst features
The static imagery used for each sound is boring. A video or animated 
effects would be a nice touch for watching the app. The optional clock, 
while useful, is butt ugly.

 BMI Calculator
 
Free
BMI stands for Body Mass Index, which is a measure of how over- or 
underweight you are. Enter your height (in centimeters, inches, or 
feet), your weight (in kilograms, pounds, or stone), your age and sex, 
and you’ll get your BMI. Hypothetically, my BMI is 29.4, which is tech-
nically overweight. You should talk to your doctor to find out your 
ideal BMI, but the point of the app is to allow you to monitor your BMI 
over time. The app offers a graph of the last ten results, complete with 
a green, yellow, and red band for understanding where you fall (green 
is good, red is bad).
 Calorie Tr acker by 
 
LIVESTRONG.COM
 
$2.99 US
This is a companion app for LIVESTRONG.COM’s The Daily Plate ser-
vice, which is itself owned by the Lance Armstrong Foundation. With 
it, you can track your calorie intake from food and your caloric burn 
from exercises using the LIVESTRONG.COM database of more than 
525,000 food and restaurant items, which includes calories and other 
nutritional information. You don’t need an account to access the data-
base or track your activity and food, but you can customize a program 
and regime if you do. With that account, you can manage your infor-
mation through the Web site or your iPhone, where it all gets synced.
 Eye Glasses
 
$2.99 US
Eye Glasses is a great app for getting a close-up look at something, 
which is especially handy for those of us with aging eyes. It only works 
properly for iPhone 3GS because that iPhone has an autofocus camera. 
Eye Glasses taps into that camera and its zoom feature (2X, 4X, 6X, or 
8X). Just point your iPhone at what you need to look at — say, the small 
print on a bottle of pills, or maybe the fine print in a legal document — 
and Eye Glasses shows you a magnified image for easy reading. It’s bril-
liant in its simplicity and utility!

 Restaurant Nutrition
 
Free (ad supported)
Restaurant Nutrition is another handy database of nutritional informa-
tion for more than 60 national and regional fast food chains in the U.S. 
Taco Bell, White Castle, California perennial favorite In-N-Out Burger, 
Chick-Fil-A, A&W . . . they’re all here, with many more, and the company 
adds new chains quite often. You can track what you eat, too, adding 
items from the database into meals that then go into your history. The 
app also includes a tie-in to the Google Maps app for quickly finding 
nearby restaurants from that chain. As of this writing, the developers 
are planning versions of the app for the U.K. and Canada, and they seem 
to add new features frequently.
 Yoga STRETCH
 
$0.99 US
Yoga STRETCH is like having a personal yoga instructor in your 
pocket, sort of. She won’t be able to teach you yoga poses you don’t 
already know, but with this app, you can program your own sessions 
with your own music (or use the default music included), and Yoga 
STRETCH tells you which stretch to do and when to change. Each 
pose includes a silhouette of a woman doing the pose against beauti-
ful backgrounds, basic vocal directions on how to do it, along with 
its English and Sanskrit names, and other information. You can pause 
your workout, skip poses, or go back to a previous pose as needed.

9 Music
 Bloom
 
 
$3.99 US
 I think what I like best about Bloom is that 
it’s uniquely difficult to describe. That’s 
why I’m leaving the description to its co-
creator, ambient music pioneer Brian Eno: 
“Bloom is an endless music machine, a 
music box for the 21st century. You can 
play it, and you can watch it play itself.”
Okay. I realize that although that statement 
does capture the spirit of Bloom, it’s not 
particularly descriptive. So let me try to 
put it another way. To me, Bloom is one 
part musical instrument, one part ambi-
ent music generator, and one part music-
derived art. In its interactive play mode, you tap your iPhone screen 
to create elaborate musical patterns and uniquely interesting melodies 
that are paired with colorful patterns of dots that appear when you 
tap the screen. For example, the figure on the left is what Bloom might 
look like after you’ve played it (by tapping) for a few minutes.
Each tap produces notes that sound to me like a 19th century music 
box mated with a Bösendorfer grand piano to produce a Fender 
Rhodes electric piano. The three join to sing in unison while random 
synthesized chord-like structures play softly in the background under 
the music box/piano tones. At times the chords sound like a string 
ensemble and at other times they sound like nothing else on earth. I 
mean that in the nicest way possible. 
If you don’t feel like tapping, you can let Bloom’s generative music 
player take over to create an infinite selection of compositions with 
accompanying visuals.
When you launch Bloom, you can select the Classic, Infinite, or 
Freestyle modes. Each one offers a slightly different kind of audio and 
video experience. You can also choose to either Listen or Create. In 
Listen mode, Bloom produces the music for you, although you’re free 
to add your own taps as well; in Create mode, Bloom leaves it to you 
to do the tapping.

Bloom has myriad settings — some of which appear in the figure on 
the right — that you can tinker with to subtly alter what you see and 
hear. The app includes a dozen “moods” to choose from, which are 
preset combinations of colors and sounds, each with an interesting 
name such as Neroli, Ambrette, Labdanum, and Tolu. 
Bloom is soothing to me, and I often play with it when I’m feeling 
stressed. If you’re a fan of Brian Eno, into meditation, enjoy playing 
with apps that are soothing and relaxing, or if you just like playing 
with an interesting app, you’ll appreciate Bloom as much as I do.
Best features 
Bloom is totally unique and there’s nothing else like it except perhaps 
Trope ($3.99 US) or Air ($1.99 US), which the developers of Bloom also 
created.
Worst features 
It would be nice to have some additional sounds. The music box/
Bösendorfer/Rhodes tones are beautiful, but variety is the spice of life. 
I’d love to hear some other sounds in Bloom.

 FourTrack
 
$9.99 US
As  a wannabe singer/songwriter, I am in love with FourTrack, an app 
that turns your iPhone into a genuine four-track audio recorder for 
less than ten bucks.
If you’re familiar with multi-track recording software for your Mac or PC, 
such as GarageBand, Pro Tools, or Logic, you know what a multi-track 
recorder does. For the rest of you, a multi-track recorder allows you to 
record one track, listen to that track while you record another track, 
listen to those two tracks while you record a third track, and so on.
Here’s how I use FourTrack: I choose a tempo and turn on the built-in 
metronome (click track) and then record my acoustic guitar on the 
first track. When I’m happy with my guitar work, I listen to the first 
track in my earphones while I sing the lead vocal (melody) and record 
it on the second track. When I’m happy with the first two tracks, I 
listen to both of them in my earphones while I sing a harmony or 
unison (double) vocal part and record it on the third track. And if I’m 
feeling particularly ambitious, I may even add a second guitar part or 
a third vocal part on the fourth track. 
After I’ve recorded everything to my satisfaction, I mix the tracks by 
adjusting the track levels (volume) and pan controls (stereo image 
left or right). In the figure on the left, track 3 is the loudest and track 
2 is the quietest; tracks 1 and 4 are slightly louder than track 2 and a 
little softer than track 3. The little blue L, C, and R near the bottom of 
each track indicate the track’s pan position. Tracks 1 and 4 sound like 
they’re dead center; track 2 sounds about halfway between the center 
and left speaker; and track 3 sounds slightly to the right of center.
At this point, I can even enhance the sound of my recording by apply-
ing some EQ (equalization), as shown in the figure on the right, or 
compression. When I’m happy with the way everything sounds, I 
can use FourTrack’s built-in Wi-Fi export to transfer either a stereo 
mix (all four tracks in a single .WAV file) or four individual tracks (as 
four individual .WAV files). If I export the individual track files, I can 
then import them to a desktop audio program such as Pro Tools or 
GarageBand so that I can continue working on my song. 
104
Chapter 9: Music 

105
The sound quality of FourTrack is excellent, and you can make it 
even better if you use a decent headset or external microphone (such 
as the Blue Mikey) instead of the iPhone’s built-in mic. How good is 
good? Well, a band called The 88s recorded an entire song called, 
“Love Is the Thing” using nothing but an iPhone running FourTrack. 
Visit www.sonomawireworks.com for links to the song and other 
recordings made by FourTrack users.
I grew up in a time where four-track recording could be accomplished 
only in recording studios. So FourTrack’s audio quality and feature set 
blow me away. If you sing, write songs, or play any instrument, I feel 
certain you’ll have as much fun as I do creating your own multi-track 
recordings with FourTrack.
Best features 
This app is a freakin’ four-track recording studio that costs a mere $10 
and requires nothing more than your iPhone. All of its features rock!
Worst features 
I wish it were easier to plug an electric guitar or studio microphone 
into my iPhone. This deficit is actually an iPhone issue, so there’s 
nothing FourTrack can do about it.

 GrooveMaker Free
 
Free
If you fancy yourself a DJ, freestyle rapper, hip-hop producer, or just 
someone who likes to create dance/hip-hop/rap beats on the fly, 
GrooveMaker Free is a superb app that lets you do it right on your 
iPhone. Using the app is fun; it’s easy; and, after you get the hang of it, 
it’s quite addicting. 
GrooveMaker Free gives you two free “songs,” which in GrooveMaker 
parlance are remixable groups of audio loops that sound good 
together.
In the figure, you can see I’ve started work on a new project. 
GrooveMaker gives me eight tracks to play with, and I’ve already filled 
the first five with
 
✓ A bass loop (Bass) on track 1
 
✓ A random loop (Loop) on track 2
 
✓ A lead line loop (Line) on track 3
 
✓ A sound bed loop (Bd) on track 4
 
✓ A string pad loop (Pad) on track 5
When I tap the Play button near the bottom of the screen (the one 
marked Groove), these five loops begin to play in unison.
If I tap any of the four Mix buttons on the right side of the screen — 
Random (D), Inst (C), Perc (B), and Mild (A) — GrooveMaker gener-
ates a new mix in the chosen genre by changing the loop(s) on one 
or more of the tracks. Each time I tap any of the mix buttons I get an 
entirely new blend of five loops on tracks 1 through 5. 
If I tap the Loops button at the bottom of the screen, the Mix buttons 
are replaced by a long list of available loops. I can replace the loops 
on tracks 1–5 with different tracks or place new loops on tracks 6 –8, 
which are currently empty.
You can do so much more with this app, but I’m nearly out of space to 
describe the possibilities. You can adjust the level (volume) and pan 
(left or right stereo imaging) and Solo or Mute any track. You can save 
the snippets you build as grooves, which you can use as building blocks 
to create longer sequences. Finally, you can export your song as a full 
quality 44Khz/16-bit .WAV file to share with friends or burn on a CD.
Chapter 9: Music 

107
I’ve been talking about GrooveMaker Free, but you should know that 
you can also get seven GrooveMaker Style Packs: Club, House, Hip-
Hop, Techno, Trance, Drum and Bass, and Electro. You can buy them 
in the App Store as individual stand-alone apps or as in-app purchases 
for $4.99 or $9.99 each. That said, you can still have tons of fun and 
create unique and great-sounding tracks with only the free version 
and its two free “songs.”
One last thing: If this kind of app turns you on, check out the iDrum 
and Looptastic apps. These are other apps that let you sequence 
loops and beats. The iDrum series offers loops by recording artists 
that include Depeche Mode, Ministry of Sound, and RZA of Wu-Tang. 
Looptastic Producer is a lot like GrooveMaker but, in addition to 
including six remixable tracks, it lets you import your own AIFF, WAV, 
or OGG files as loops.
 
GrooveMaker is truly a remarkable app with a broad and deep fea-
ture set. So I urge you to visit the GrooveMaker Web site (http://
groovemaker.com) to view the tutorial videos. I guarantee you’ll 
learn some cool tricks that’ll help you make better-sounding tracks. 
Best features 
GrooveMaker has an intuitive user interface and a terrific set of tools. 
Together they make creating custom musical compositions easy and fun.
Worst features 
GrooveMaker doesn’t have a way for you to import your own loops.

 Leaf Trombone: World Stage
 
$0.99 US
The d escription of Leaf Trombone: World Stage in the iTunes App 
Store says it’s “the first massively multiplayer music game.” So you’re 
probably wondering why the app is listed here instead of in Chapter 7 
with the other games. The answer is that, at least in my humble opin-
ion, Leaf Trombone: World Stage is more like a musical instrument or 
an episode of American Idol than a game. 
You can play your Leaf Trombone in one of two ways. The first way 
requires you to blow into the microphone on your iPhone; the second 
eschews any blowing. Either way, you tap the right side of the screen to 
play notes with your Leaf Trombone — tap the long green thing on the 
right side of the screen in the figure on the left, which I think looks like 
a kazoo wearing a gold ring. Touch nearer the top of the screen to play 
lower notes and nearer the bottom of the screen to play higher notes. 
If you tap, you hear individual notes play one at a time. But when you 
slide your finger up or down the screen you hear the pitch of the note 
change as you slide — just as if you were playing a real trombone!
When you launch Leaf Tr ombone, you choose from three options: 
Play a Song, Free Play, or World Stage. In the Play a Song or Free Play 
mode you play the Leaf Trombone; in World Stage mode, which I get 
to shortly, you can play, observe, or judge other performers.
In the Play a Song mode, you pick one of the hundreds of available songs 
and play along with it. The figure on the right shows a list of my personal 
favorites. To play the song, you tap the leaves as they move from left to 
right across the square dots just to the left of the Leaf Trombone itself. 
When you play the correct note as the leaf passes over the little square, 
the square illuminates, as shown in the figure on the left.
 
The songs you play along with are created by Leaf Trombone users 
with the free Web-based Leaf Trombone Composer tool (http://
leaftrombone.smule.com/composer).
Free Play mode is like Play a Song mode without leaves or square 
dots. In other words, you play whatever you please without any 
accompaniment. 
World Stage is the mode that reminds me of American Idol. In this 
mode, you perform and an international jury of your peers judges your 
performance. If you prefer, you can choose to observe others who 
Chapter 9: Music 

109
are performing and being judged, or you can volunteer to be a judge 
yourself. Along the way, you earn Achievements (such as Persistent 
Performer and Expert Judge) and earn rank in both the performer and 
judge categories. 
If you have a friend or family member who has a copy of Leaf 
Trombone, you can play together in the Bluetooth Duet mode, which 
doesn’t require a Wi-Fi or other Internet connection. 
Leaf Trombone is truly one of the most enjoyable iPhone apps I own. 
If you don’t want to shell out a buck, you can go for the free version 
called Leaf Trombone: Lite & Free. This version limits you to a single 
song and allows you to observe or judge (but not perform) on the 
World Stage.
Best features 
Because Leaf Trombone includes hundreds of songs and new songs 
are added every day, using this app never gets old. Judging the Leaf 
Trombone performances of others may be even more fun than playing 
the Leaf Trombone.
Worst features 
Duet mode is flaky and onl y works sporadically for me.

 MusicID with Lyrics 
 
$2.99 US
Ever hear a song on the radio, on television, in a store, or at a club and 
wonder what it’s called or who is singing it? With MusicID with Lyrics, 
you may never wonder again. Just launch the app and point your 
iPhone’s microphone at the source of the music. In a few seconds, the 
song title, artist’s name, and much more magically appear on your 
iPhone screen, as shown in the figure on the left.
Now, before I tell you any more about MusicID with Lyrics, allow me to 
provide a little background. Once upon a time, there was a fabulous free 
app called Shazam that identified songs and artists in the same way as 
MusicID with Lyrics does. Everyone loved Shazam. My co-author and I 
even named it one of our ten favorite free apps in iPhone For Dummies, 
3rd Edition, and said we would happily pay a few bucks for it.
And we would have. The developers got greedy, however, and 
changed the app’s name to Shazam Encore. They began charging 
$4.99 and crippled the free version by limiting it to a mere five songs 
per month. 
I paid the $4.99 and tried Shazam Encore, which isn’t bad. But I then 
stumbled upon MusicID with Lyrics, which is noticeably better at 
identifying songs and artists, has a killer feature not available in any 
version of Shazam, and costs only $2.99. 
The killer feature I mentioned is that it offers song lyrics for many of 
the songs it identifies, as shown in the figure on the right. 
If all MusicID with Lyrics could do is hear a song and display its name, 
recording artist, and lyrics in a few seconds, it would probably be enough 
to make this a great app. But this app does more, such as providing
 
✓ A link to the song in the iTunes Store 
 
✓ A link to related videos on YouTube
 
✓ A biography of the artist
 
✓ A map showing where you were when the song was identified 
 
✓ A list of similar songs (with info and lyrics)
 
✓ Identific ation of songs in your iPod Library (with info and lyrics)
 
✓ Capability to search for songs by title, artist, or lyric phrase
 
✓ Capability for you to e-mail song information to your friends
Chapter 9: Music 

111
MusicID with Lyrics is much better than Shazam at identifying classi-
cal music, jazz, opera, and show tunes, and it’s better at identifying 
songs by obscure indie bands. I tested MusicID with Lyrics on nearly 
100 songs, including the most obscure tunes in my iTunes library, 
and it correctly identified all but a handful. Furthermore, the songs 
it missed were really obscure, and it nailed quite a few songs I didn’t 
think it would, such as “In the Court of the Crimson King” by King 
Crimson; the Peter Gunn theme (Emerson, Lake & Palmer live); and 
songs by the Dave Brubeck Quartet, Dave Clark Five, Dave Matthews 
Band, David Lee Roth, David Gilmour, David Bowie, and even David 
Seville and the Chipmunks.
My conclusion is that for popular music, including old and obscure 
songs, MusicID with Lyrics totally rocks (pun intended) and does a 
better job than Shazam at identifying jazz, hip-hop, country music, and 
show tunes.
Best features 
MusicID with Lyrics is amazing. It has worked for me in noisy airport 
terminals, crowded department stores, and even with a DJ at a wed-
ding. This app also makes a jaw-dropping demo of something very 
cool you can do with your iPhone. 
Worst features 
Although the app finds the lyrics for many songs, I wish it could find 
lyrics for even more.

 Bebot - Robot Synth
 
$1.99 US
Bebot is a clever app that’s part robot and part polyphonic musical 
synthesizer. When you touch the screen, the robot moves and makes 
different sounds controlled by your finger movements. With four-finger 
multitouch polyphony, multiple synthesis modes, user-definable pre-
sets and scales, adjustable synth settings and effects, and more, Bebot 
is sophisticated but is still simple enough for anyone to use and enjoy.
 
If you’re a fan of the Beach Boys, select the Theremin preset and see if 
you can re-create the theremin part in “Good Vibrations.” Don’t know 
what a theremin is? Look it up. Don’t know what it sounds like? It’s the 
unearthly sound in the choruses and at the end of “Good Vibrations.”
 Concert Vault
 
Free
Wolfgang’s Concert Vault is an app that provides you with free access 
to the largest collection of concert recordings in the world. Some of my 
favorite concerts include The Who, Led Zeppelin, King Crimson, Neil 
Young, Pink Floyd, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Elvis Costello, and 
David Bowie. If none of those particular artists appeal to you, you can 
find concert recordings by hundreds upon hundreds of other artists.
The cool thing about Concert Vault is that it gives you access to 
exclusive recordings you probably haven’t heard before and probably 
won’t hear elsewhere, such as master recordings from the archives of 
Bill Graham Presents, the King Biscuit Flower Hour, and many others.
 I Am T-Pain 
 
$2.99 US
Do you know what the Auto-Tune sound is? It’s the weirdly altered 
vocal sound first heard on Cher’s 1998 hit, “Believe,” and more 
recently used by R & B singer T-Pain, not to mention most rap and 
hip-hop songs of recent memory. 

113
 Chapter 9: Music
With I Am T-Pain you can apply the famous Auto-Tune effect to your 
voice as you sing along with several of T-Pain’s most famous songs, 
which come complete with lyrics, Auto-Tune settings, and timings. If 
you prefer, you can freestyle and record your Auto-Tuned voice.
Prices for the Antares Technologies (www.antarestech.com) Auto-
Tune plug-in used by the pros start at $129; the I Am T-Pain app costs 
$2.99 and is almost as much fun. Any questions?
 Pandora Radio
 
Free
Pandora Radio is one of the coolest concepts ever. You tell it the names 
of your favorite musicians and songs and then Pandora creates an 
instant personalized radio station that plays only songs that exemplify 
the style of music represented by the artists and songs you named.
I based one of my Pandora stations on songs by the Byrds, Tom Petty, 
and the Beatles. The result is a station with songs by those artists but 
also a lot of similar music by artists with whom I’m not familiar. I made 
another station based on music by Dave Brubeck that plays great 
music by jazz artists I’ve never heard before. 
Pandora Radio is free. It’s awesome. Give it a try. 
 Simplify Music 2
 
$5.99 US
The iPhone is a fabulous iPod, but even the 32GB iPhone 3GS doesn’t 
have enough storage space for all my music. Simplify Music 2 fixes 
that deficiency by letting me stream all the music in my iTunes library 
(Mac or PC) and listen to it on my iPhone via any Wi-Fi or 3G cellular 
connection.
That feature is pretty cool, but what’s even better is that you can 
invite up to 30 of your friends to listen to your entire iTunes music 
library, and you can listen to the music libraries of up to 30 of your 
friends, as well!
The more music (and friends with music) you have, the more you’ll 
love Simplify Music 2.

 ColorCanvas Plus
 
 
$0.99 US
Some photography apps are like a Swiss 
Army Knife, with bells, whistles, and fea-
tures galore. Others, such as ColorCanvas 
Plus and its free sibling ColorCanvas Basic, 
focus on doing one thing well. In this case, 
that one thing is converting a photo to 
black and white and then enabling you 
to selectively colorize specific parts of 
it. Because a picture is worth a thousand 
words, I could technically tell you to check 
out the before (left) and after (right) pic-
tures and move on to the next app.
Never fear, gentle reader; I vowed to tell you what you need to know. 
Even though that pair of pix says it all, let me tell you how the app 
works and how easy it is to achieve stunning effects. 
Start with a picture. You can shoot a new one or select it from your 
iPhone’s  Camera Roll or Photo Album. Either way, the second step is 
to choose one of the three mono-color filters — normal, enhanced, or 
hi-contrast — offered by ColorCanvas Plus. The difference between 
the three is subtle, and the best way to determine which one is best 
for a particular image is to try all three.
Now it’s time to get creative and break out one of the three brushes, 
called Color, Mono, and Tint. The Color brush brushes away the black 
and white to reveal the color from the original photo. The Mono brush 
does the opposite — it brushes away color you’ve revealed with the 
Color brush, which is handy if you make a mistake or want to zoom 
in to clean up problem areas. Finally, the Tint brush lets you tint any 
part of the image.
In the picture on the right, I used the color brush to reveal the colors 
in my daughter’s hat, hair, skin, and snake. I accidentally revealed 
some of her colorful bathing suit top, so I painted over it with the 
mono brush until it was just right. Finally, I wanted her hat and the 
snake to stand out a little more, so I carefully tinted her cap a dark 
shade of blue and tinted the snake with a mustard-like wash.

Your paintbrushes can be any size, from pencil-thin to fatter than my 
thumb. You can adjust the brush’s opacity from nearly transparent to 
pretty much opaque. Finally, you can undo and redo brush strokes to 
your heart’s content.
The bottom line is that if a talentless clod like me can achieve stun-
ning (in my humble opinion) artistic effects with ColorCanvas Plus, 
just think what you’ll be able to do. 
The free version, called ColorCanvas Basic, doesn’t include the 
Tint brush or paint colors, which I think are essential. However, the 
free app is kind of fun to use if you’re too cheap to pay a buck for 
ColorCanvas Plus.
Best features 
With ColorCanvas Plus you can create a unique and interesting effect 
with little effort or talent.
Worst features 
The zooming and panning features don’t work as smoothly as in many 
other apps.

 C omic Touch
 
$2.99 US
You have a phone and the phone has a camera. If you also have a 
sense of humor, you need Comic Touch, the iPhone app that lets you 
be a cartoonist even if you can’t draw a straight line.
Shoot a new picture or select one from an iPhone Photo Album, and let 
the fun begin. You can put words in peoples’ mouths by adding cartoon 
balloons in four different styles: Speech, Thought, Whisper, and Exclaim. 
You can add a caption to describe the scene, give the scene a title, or just 
add text to make fun of your subject. You can see all of these features in 
the figure on the left. “Antennas? What antennas?” is a speech 
balloon; “Jacob was somehow different. . . .” is a caption.
The developers of Comic Touch weren’t chintzy, providing you with the 
tired old Marker Felt font, either. Instead, all your comic words appear 
in an exclusive comic-lettering font that you won’t find in other apps.
Comic Touch couldn’t be easier to use. After you select the picture 
you want to deface, drag cartoon balloons and caption boxes onto 
it. Double-tap any balloon or caption box to open the app’s Details 
screen, which is where you can type your words, select a font size 
(Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large, or Giant), and choose a color 
scheme (black on white as shown on the left, or white on black).
Just for fun, Comic Touch also provides several goofy distortion effects 
including Bulge, Dent, Stretch, and Light (as shown in the figure on the 
right). The nifty Smudge tool lets you freely warp images any way you 
like. If you decide you don’t like your smudging, you can shake your 
iPhone to restore the original image.
When you’re happy with your creation, you can save it to your iPhone 
Camera Roll or e-mail it to friends or photo-sharing sites such as 
Flickr.com and Skitch.com.
That’s about it for features in Comic Touch, so let me give you a 
couple of tips for using the app effectively. First, go to the Web site 
(www.plasq.com/comictouch) and watch the movie. It wasn’t until 
I did so that I learned you can delete any balloon or caption by press-
ing and holding for a few seconds until a little x appears, just like when 
you press and hold an icon on the iPhone’s home screen. Tap the x to 
delete the balloon or box. 
116
Chapter 10: Photography 

117
You can also position or reposition any cartoon balloon by pressing in 
its middle and dragging. You can position the balloon’s tail — which 
is the part that comes out of the person’s mouth — by pressing on the 
tip of the tail and dragging it where you want it.
One last thing: There’s a free version of the app called Comic Touch 
Lite, but it has a reduced feature set and places an ugly watermark on 
any comics you save or share. Caveat emptor (even though it’s free).
Best features
I love everything about Comic Touch. I get a lot of laughs putting 
words in peoples’ mouths and then sending them the results. I have 
more fun with Comic Touch than with almost any other app I own. 
Every time I send one of my comics to someone who uses an iPhone, 
the person begs me to tell them what app I used and usually then buys 
the app and loves it. 
Worst features
It would be nice to be able to add borders and create multi-panel 
comics, just like comics from Marvel and DC. Even though the comic 
lettering font is unique and good-looking, I’d be happier if I had a few 
fonts to choose from (there’s only the one).

 FX Photo Studio 
 
$1.99 US
If you’re only going to buy one app to use with your iPhone camera, FX 
Photo Studio is probably your best bet. With 119 mostly high-quality 
photographic effects, I don’t know of another app that offers as many 
decent options at any price, let alone one that costs less than 2¢ per 
effect. 
The effects are divided into 14 categories for your convenience: Image 
Correction (as shown in the figure on the left), Color Fantasy, Texturize, 
Color Temperature, Overlay, Glow, Hue, Vintage, Simmetry (sic), Blur, 
Distortion, Frames, and Photo Styles. 
Each category contains five or ten different effects, including useful 
ones such as More Contrast, Brighter Image, Less Colors, and Radial 
Blur. The app offers dozens of artistic effects, such as the Vintage 
Burnt Paper effect I applied to the picture of myself in the top half of 
the figure on the right (the bottom half, of course, shows the original 
image for comparison).
I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that the app includes a number of 
effects I wouldn’t use on my worst enemy, much less someone I like. 
For example, the Kisses overlay embeds a bright red lipstick print on 
your photo, whereas the Ghost, Skull, and Scary Face effects stick a 
stupid-looking semi-transparent ghost, skull, or fanged face, respec-
tively, in your picture. On the other hand, the dumb effects are a small 
fraction of the total, and most of them aren’t nearly so stupid.
After you shoot a new picture or select an existing photo from your 
iPhone Photo Albums and choose an effect to apply to it, a small preview 
appears mid-screen. The preview is a nice touch because applying the 
effect can take a few seconds; after checking out the preview, you can 
cancel the effect instead of applying it if it’s not what you want.
Speaking of processing time, FX Photo Studio lets you choose the reso-
lution for the images you modify — anywhere from 320 to 2048 pixels 
on an iPhone 3GS (earlier models only allow a max of 1024 pixels). 
The higher the resolution you select, the longer it takes to apply an 
effect, which at the highest resolution can take several minutes. The 
good news is that FX Photo Studio offers an option to display Amazing 
Facts during image processing such as, “The surface speed record on 
the moon is 10.56 mph, set by a lunar rover.” I found some of the facts 
quite interesting, and reading them is better than having to stare at a 
spinning pinwheel for a minute or two.
Chapter 10: Photography 

119
With all the available effects, you might have a hard time deciding 
which one to use, so there’s a handy die icon. Tap it to see a preview 
of a random effect. Tap Cancel and tap the die icon again to see a 
different random effect, or tap Apply to apply the current effect to 
your image. 
FX Photo Studio includes a couple of other nice features in addition to 
the effects. One is a slide control for adjusting the Gamma (luminance) 
of your image. Another is a cropping tool that lets you rotate your 
image in 1° or 5° increments before you crop it.
Finally, you can apply multiple effects to an image and use a multistep 
undo option if you don’t like the results.
Best features 
FX Photo Studio offers so many useful and artistic effects there’s 
something in it for everybody. The quality of most effects is quite 
good. This app is a bargain at $1.99. 
Worst features 
My only criticism is that misspelling a category name is just sloppy, 
and Simmetry isn’t even a real word.

 OldBooth Premium
 
$0.99 US
Have you ever wondered what you might have looked like if you had 
lived and dressed in the styles of another era? All you need is a copy of 
the OldBooth Premium app and you won’t have to wonder any longer.
OldBooth Premium enables you to take any full-face photo and insert 
the person’s face into hair and wardrobe from another time. This is 
another case where a picture is worth thousands of words, so take 
a gander at the figure at the bottom of the next page, which clearly 
demonstrates just what OldBooth Premium does.
You get the picture, don’t you? (Pun completely intended.)
The top row of snapshots shows the original picture of me on the left 
and three OldBooth-ed versions (left to right): Afro-hair Bob of the six-
ties, suave Dean Martin-esque Bob of the fifties, and Bob as Steve Jobs 
in the eighties. Beneath that is an original photo of my wife on the left 
with three OldBooth-ed renditions of her (left to right): Roaring twen-
ties Lisa, fifties bouffant hair Lisa, and Lisa as a beret-wearing beatnik 
of the sixties.
Creating one of these goofy portraits with OldBooth Premium is as 
easy as 1-2-3:
 
1. Choose a gender and then select one of the nearly 30 mask 
styles available for each gender.
 
2. Choose a picture to deface.
 
 You can either take a new photo with your iPhone’s camera or 
choose a picture from your iPhone’s Photo Library.
 
3. Resize the picture by pinching or unpinching, rotate the pic-
ture by pressing and dragging, and adjust the brightness of 
either the picture, the mask, or both. If your original image 
is facing the wrong way, double tap to flip it horizontally. 
And if you mess up entirely, triple tap to start over.
 
 When you’re happy with the image, tap the Done button to 
save it to your iPhone’s Camera Roll, where you can use it as 
wallpaper, e-mail it to a friend, assign it to a contact, or send it 
to your MobileMe gallery. Of course, the doctored image is 
exported to your Mac or PC the next time you sync your iPhone.
Chapter 10: Photography 

121
OldBooth Premium is simple to use, gives great results with very little 
work, and is just plain fun. Furthermore, if a buck is more than you want 
to spend, check out the free version. It’s called OldBooth (without the 
Premium), and it only includes a handful of masks for each gender.
There is one last thing . . . OldBooth Premium includes two hidden 
super-secret masks — one for each gender. The male mask is the Steve 
Jobs-like one shown on the far right of the top row of pictures. I’ll 
leave it to you to discover the female mask. The secret is to triple tap 
the words Choose Style on the male or female Choose Style screen.
Best features
You can have a lot of fun disfiguring your friends with OldBooth 
Premium, and it only takes a couple of minutes to create a pretty good 
likeness. None of the pictures below took more than two or three 
minutes. After you get the hang of using OldBooth Premium, you can 
knock out doctored photos really fast.
Worst features
I’m sick of the masks already. I’d even pay more for a version with new 
or different masks. That said, I’ve had this app for more than a year, 
so it’ll take a while before you get sick of them, too.

 Photogene
 
$2.99 US
Phot ogene is one of my favorite apps. It’s the app I use most often 
when I need to improve a photo I shot with my iPhone. It has most (if 
not all) the features I need to make a mediocre photo look good or to 
make a good photo look great.
Photogene has an exceptional user interface with controls that are easier 
to understand and use than some other photo apps. Photogene also has 
an extensive list of features, represented by the nine icons on the far left 
side of the screen (as shown in the figures):
 
✓ Scissors: This cropping tool provides several preset aspect 
ratios, including 1:1 (square), 3:4 and 4:3 (standard rectangular 
photos), 9:16 (widescreen), and 3:2 (iPhone screen).
 
✓ Arrows: This icon has tools for rotating, flipping, or straightening 
your photo.
 
✓ Funnel (at least I think that’s what it is): This icon reveals tools for 
sharpening your photo, turning it into a pencil sketch (as shown 
in the figure on the right), plus three special effects — sepia tone, 
night vision, and heat map. 
 
✓ Color wheel: This icon reveals serious image-editing controls: 
levels, exposure, colors, and RGB. I love the Photoshop-like histo-
gram for adjusting relative brightness levels, as shown in the figure 
on the left. Tap the Auto button to the right of the histogram, and 
Photogene does its best to optimize the levels in your image auto-
matically. It usually does a pretty good job, so I suggest you try the 
Auto button before you drag the level sliders hither and yon. The 
exposure control is actually two slider controls — one for exposure 
and the other for contrast. The colors control is also a pair of 
sliders— saturation and color temperature. If you drag the satura-
tion slider all the way to the left, it makes your photo black and 
white. Finally, the RGB balance control has three sliders that let you 
increase or reduce the red, green, or blue channels in your image.
 
✓ Star: This icon enables you to drag a variety of cartoon balloons and 
shapes onto your photos with complete control over the outline, 
fill, and text colors. You also have a choice of five fonts (but none 
look as much like a comic book as the exclusive font used by Comic 
Touch).
 
✓ Square: Tapping this icon (shown in the figure on the right) dis-
closes the frames, backgrounds, and effects options. The tape on 
the corners of the image is one of the preset frame options; the 
Chapter 10: Photography 

123
blue background is one of the background color options; and the 
reflection below the picture is one of the special effect options.
 
✓ Curved arrows: These two icons let you undo and redo any 
effects you’ve applied to the current image. It lets you undo 
one mistake or even many mistakes. What’s really cool about it, 
though, is that it also lets you see your picture before and after 
an effect is applied.
 
✓ Done: Tap this check mark icon to save your work after editing.
Best features
All of Photogene’s features are really quite excellent, so I think the best 
thing about this app is that it has so many high-quality image-editing 
tools. The intuitive and uncluttered user interface and unlimited undo/
redo support are not too shabby, either. 
Worst features
My big complaint is that the shadow effect options for frames are ugly 
and there is no way to adjust their transparency.
My minor gripe is that the pencil, reflection, and frame effects work 
well and deliver beautiful results on most images, but I wish there were 
more special effects such as crayon, oil paint, mosaic, or watercolor. If 
those effects existed and looked as good as the pencil, reflection, and 
most of the frame effects, they’d be awesome!

 Best  Camera 
 
$2.99 US
Inspired by the old saying, “the best camera is the one that’s with 
you,” Best Camera was designed by renowned photographer Chase 
Jarvis. He wanted an app that made it easy to shoot, creatively edit, 
and share photos. With 14 great-looking effects, previews, selectable 
resolution, and integration with Facebook, Twitter, and any sharing 
service that lets you upload pictures by e-mail (such as Flickr.com), if 
it’s not the best, it’s still very good. 
What makes Best Camera unique is its clever interface, which is 
designed to let you change the order of the effects after you apply 
them. You can experiment with Best Camera in ways you can’t with 
other apps by shuffling the order in which the effects are applied.
 FocalLab
 
$0.99 US
Okay, some people might call FocalLab a one-trick pony, and I 
wouldn’t argue. But in the case of this app, the one trick is so cool 
that it’s easily worth a buck to me. FocalLab applies professional-
looking depth of field and lens effects to your photos. There are four 
blur options — dreamy, soft focus, zoom, and motion blur — plus a 
vignette effect with three shapes, and adjustments for center point 
and light fall-off. The thing that makes all the effects look so spec-
tacular is a slide control for adjusting the intensity and a feature for 
“selective focusing,” which lets you choose the location and size of the 
in-focus area.
 Pano
 
$2.99 US
Pano lets you take seamless panoramic pictures with your iPhone. With 
a handy semi-transparent guide and advanced alignment, blending, and 
color-correcting algorithms, you can stitch together up to 16 individual 
photos and save the finished panorama — with a resolution of up to 
6,800 x 800 — directly to your iPhone camera roll.

 Chapter 10: Photography
This app is a hoot. The guides make it easy to get exceptional results 
and the finished product can be spectacular.
Check out the excellent examples of what Pano can do in the Pano 
for iPhone group at Flickr.com (www.flickr.com/groups/
iphonepanoramas/).
 Photo shop.com Mobile
 
Free
Another excellent choice for improving photos, Photoshop.com 
Mobile has all the features you’d expect from an app that bears the 
Photoshop name — crop, rotate, flip, exposure, saturation, tint, and 
color-to-black-and-white conversions. I don’t much care for the Sketch 
and Soft Focus filters or the special effects, such as Border, Vignette 
Blur, Warm Vintage, Rainbow, and Soft Black and White. 
Wondering why I recommend it? Well, I really like the way it’s inte-
grated with my Photoshop.com account. I can upload to and down-
load from my online photo library and use the much more advanced 
Photoshop.com image editing tools for images that need more help 
than any iPhone app can provide. 
 Reel Director
 
$7.99 US
Although it’s for the iPhone 3GS only, Reel Director is an amazing app 
that lets you do great things with movies you shoot with your iPhone. 
It’s hard to believe, but Reel Director lets you combine and rearrange 
clips, add text overlays, add really cool opening and closing credits 
and title cards, and — my favorite feature — includes 27 really sweet 
transitions, which have animated previews and can be applied globally 
to an entire project.
Reel Director isn’t Final Cut Pro or even iMovie, but it does let you do 
amazing things with video using nothing but your iPhone.

Awe some Note 
 
(+Todo)
 
 
$3.99 US
The iTunes App Store has more note-taking, 
to-do list apps than I can count — with more 
coming out every day. My main app in this 
category is OmniFocus for the iPhone. But 
OmniFocus is expensive ($19.99) and really 
works best if you synchronize it with the 
OmniFocus desktop app, which is also expen-
sive ($79.95) and not available for Windows. 
If you’re a Mac user and don’t mind the high 
prices, check out both apps. For everyone 
else there’s Awesome Note (+Todo).
I looked at more than a dozen note storing-and-organizing and to-do 
list apps and I think Awesome Note (+Todo) offers the best combina-
tion of features and flexibility for its price. Plus, it’s one of the best 
looking (if not the best looking) apps of its type. Its user interface is 
powerful, yet simple and elegant, as you can see in both figures.
The figure on the left is Awesome Note’s main screen. Tap the Quick 
Memo button to quickly start typing in one of the four sticky note 
memos. Tap a folder to see a list of the notes it contains (there are 
four in the Books folder, two in Personal, two in TMO Reviews, and 
so on). Or tap New Note to start typing a new note item, which you 
can file in any of your folders. Options for each note include due date, 
checkbox, priority (0, 1, 2, or 3 stars), font and font size, and a variety 
of themes, which are pretty background images (chalkboard, stone, 
pale ivory, and so on) behind the note text.
Due dates for notes are indicated on the folder they’re stored in. In the 
figure on the left, the little numbers in the circles on the TMO Reviews, 
Shopping, and To-Do List folders indicate that each folder contains 
one item (note) that’s due today.

▶ BargainBin
▶ Dropbox
▶  Pzizz Relax
▶ ReQall
▶ Instapaper Free
▶ iTranslate 
▶ Pastie
▶ ProPrompter
▶ Use Your Handwriting

127
If you tap in the middle of the screen where it says All Notes 15, you 
see a list of all the notes in all your folders, displayed by their due 
dates; the item with the earliest date (Today in the figure on the right 
below) appears at the top of the list. You can sort the items in each 
category (Today and Next in the figure) by modification date, creation 
date, name, due date, or priority.
Other nice features include the capability to protect folders with 
a four-digit passcode, three views for folder contents (thumbnail, 
list, and task), an unlimited number of folders and notes, fast global 
search, and easy import, export, backup, and restore via the free 
Google Docs service.
Finally, if you’re not sure Awesome Note is right for you, download 
Awesome Note Lite, which is a free version that’s the same in every 
way except that it’s limited to seven notes.
Best features
Awesome Note has a beautiful and elegant user interface and is power-
ful while still being flexible and easy to use. If you don’t believe it, try 
the free Lite version first.
Worst features 
Awesome Note doesn’t sync with a desktop or Web-based to-do list app.

BargainBin
 
Free 
I’ll let you in on a secret: The price of apps isn’t set in stone. 
Developers often reduce the price of apps for a limited time to build 
some buzz or introduce a new app or feature. The coolest part is that 
the reduced price is, as often as not, free.
You’ve got to love discounted apps. But here’s the rub: With more 
than 100,000 apps available in the App Store, it’s not easy to find the 
discounted apps using iTunes on your computer or the App Store 
app on your iPhone. That, gentle reader, is why BargainBin is such a 
beautiful thing. Not only does it keep track of apps and prices auto-
matically, it can alert you when prices drop. It also does some other 
things, but finding apps that are currently on sale is its forte.
The figure on the left shows BargainBin’s main screen. BargainBin filters 
apps that are on sale into 20 different categories, including Productivity, 
Music, and Social Networking. Browse all of the apps on sale in All 
Categories at once, or browse Popular apps that are on sale. Last, but 
certainly not least, you can set up a Watch List to keep track of prices 
for apps you might want to buy if the price goes down.
If you tap any item besides Watch List (see the figure on the left), a list 
of the apps on sale appears, as shown in the figure on the right. The 
lists have three buttons — All, Bargain, and Free — near the top of the 
screen. The All button shows every app that currently has a reduced 
price or is free; the Bargain button shows only apps with price reduc-
tions of 50% or more; and the Free button shows only apps that are free.
If you tap any app in any list, four buttons appear below it:
 
✓ Watch: Adds the app to your watch list
 
✓ App Store: Launches the App Store app so you can buy the app 
or read its reviews (which aren’t available in BargainBin)
 
✓ Description: Displays a description  of the app
 
✓ Screenshots: Displays screen shots of the app
In addition to tracking individual apps on your Watch List, BargainBin 
can alert you when any app in any category goes on sale or when any 
popular app goes on sale.
128
Chapter 11: Productivity 

129
Speaking of alerts, not only can BargainBin watch specific apps for 
price reductions, it can alert you to price drops. You can choose any 
or all of three types of alerts: sound alerts, on-screen alerts (such as 
the ones displayed by the Messages and Phone apps), or badge alerts 
(those little numbers shown on an app’s icon, such as the ones dis-
played by the Phone, Mail, and Messages apps).
One last thing: Because all the lists in BargainBin feature only apps 
that are on sale, you’ll be happy to know that you can search for any 
app in the App Store and add it to your Watch List.
Best features 
BargainBin has two great features: It alerts you to price reductions, 
even when the app isn’t running, and it simplifies finding apps that are 
on sale or free.
Worst features 
This is more of a missing feature than a bad one, but I would love to 
get alerts by e-mail, too. I’d also love to see user reviews and ratings.

Dropbox
 
Free
This could get confusing. You see, Dropbox is not only the name of 
this iPhone app, it’s also the name of the company, the name of the 
service it provides, and the name of the software that runs on your 
Mac, Windows, or Linux computer. So I’ll call the iPhone version 
Dropbox iPhone app, and refer to the other parts as plain ol’ Dropbox.
I was a huge fan of Dropbox (www.dropbox.com) long before the 
Dropbox iPhone app came along. To understand the beauty of the 
Dropbox iPhone app, you first need to know what Dropbox is and 
how it works. 
Dropbox is, in a nutshell, software that syncs your files online and 
across your computers. You can use it to synchronize files among as 
many Mac, Windows, or Linux computers as you want. You can use 
it to share files with anyone you want. And you can use it to back up 
important documents. 
You first create a free Dropbox account and install the free Dropbox 
software on your computers (let’s call them Computer 1 and 
Computer 2). A folder named (what else) Dropbox appears on each 
computer and all files you put in the Dropbox folder on Computer 1 
are instantly available in the Dropbox folder on Computer 2 and vice 
versa. Plus, because Dropbox stores those files on its own secure serv-
ers you can access them from anywhere with any Web browser. 
Whew. Now that you know how the Dropbox system works, I can tell 
you about the Dropbox iPhone app, which gives you access to files in 
your Dropbox folder(s) from your iPhone.
With the Dropbox iPhone app, you can use the Internet connection 
on your iPhone to view the files in your computer’s Dropbox folder, 
as shown in the figure on the left. You can also specify “favorite” files 
that are automatically copied to your iPhone so that you can access 
them without an Internet connection, and you can e-mail links to files 
in your Dropbox so your friends can download them.
Wondering what kind of files you can view in the Dropbox app? Well, 
you can view all the usual suspects: Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint) files; Apple iWork (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote) files; .PDF 
files; most types of image files such as (but not limited to) .JPEG, .TIFF, 
and .PNG; as well as music and video files. You can also upload photos or 
movies (iPhone 3GS only) from your iPhone to your Dropbox folder.
Chapter 11: Productivity 

131
Speaking of image files, whenever you have pictures in a folder that’s 
in your Dropbox folder, the pictures magically appear on your iPhone 
screen as photo galleries, as shown in the figure on the right.
I love Dropbox. Let me tell you a few of the ways I use it. I use it for 
current projects so I have access to those files from any computer in 
the world, as well as from my iPhone. Because the files are stored on 
the secure Dropbox server, they serve as an up-to-the-minute backup 
of my files. Finally, whenever I travel, I put my best photos into a 
shared Dropbox folder so my friends and family can enjoy them at 
their convenience. 
Best features 
Free app with 2GB of free online storage that you can use any way you 
like. 
Worst features 
You can’t zoom in or out of graphics files (although you can for other file 
types). Unlike Dropbox on a computer, you can’t share links to folders; 
the iPhone app only sends links to individual files (but not folders).

Pzizz  Relax
 
$2.99 US
I’ve come to believe that taking a 15- or 20-minute power nap during 
a long workday helps rejuvenate and revitalize me. That being said, 
I didn’t take many power naps until I discovered Pzizz Energizer, a 
revolutionary little program (available for both Mac and Windows; 
www.pzizz.com) that combines several different techniques to help 
me power nap and recharge my batteries. I was thrilled to hear that 
the Pzizz folks had introduced an iPhone app called Pzizz Relax, which 
uses the same technology and principles as the Mac software. Now 
all I need is my iPhone and some earphones to power nap anywhere I 
want at any time I choose.
According to its inventors, Pzizz Relax “combines Neuro Linguistic 
Programming (NLP) techniques, specially composed music, sound 
effects, and a binaural beat to induce a wonderfully relaxed state, 
similar to that of the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) stage of sleep.” They 
claim that listening to this combination of sounds encourages us sub-
consciously to relax, focus, and energize the body and the mind.
The whole thing sounded like hokum to me, but I’ll try almost anything 
once. I was extremely surprised to discover that Pzizz Energizer (the 
computer version of Pzizz) worked for me — after my very first Pzizz 
power nap I felt relaxed and refreshed. In fact, I try to grab at least one 
10- or 15-minute Pzizz nap every afternoon.
Pzizz Relax gives you complete control over what you hear. You can 
turn its guiding voice, suggestions, and 3-D audio on or off for any nap. 
You can adjust the music and voice volume levels (as shown in the 
figure on the left), as well as the type of alarm you hear at the end of 
your nap (I prefer the Tibetan Bowl, as you can see in the figure on the 
right). You can also choose any of six background soundtracks that 
have names such as Cranial Nirvana, Ocean, Sunrise, and Water Drop. 
Of course, you can determine how long you want to nap, as long as it’s 
between 10 and 90 minutes. 
Finally, Pzizz Relax uses a structured random algorithm with more 
than 100 billion voice/command/music/sound combinations, so you’re 
assured of a different soundtrack each and every time you use it. 
I love Pzizz Relax; but I have to admit that when I first heard about it I 
was skeptical. I’ve learned, though, that there’s actually some science 
Chapter 11: Productivity 

133
behind it, and several studies have determined that afternoon naps 
are indeed good for you. For example, a NASA study published in 1999 
states that napping is one of the measures that can prevent fatigue 
and lack of focus and concluded that “an afternoon nap increases pro-
ductivity by 35% and decision-making ability by up to 50%.”
I don’t understand how or why it works, but when I use Pzizz on my 
iPhone or my Mac to take a 15- or 20-minute power nap in the afternoon, 
I feel both energized and more relaxed the rest of the day. That’s not a 
bad deal for three bucks. 
Best features 
The Pzizz applications for the Mac and Windows have a few features 
not found in the iPhone app, but they also cost $40 or more. There 
also used to be a stand-alone Pzizz hardware unit, now discontinued, 
which sold for about $150. The Pzizz Relax iPhone app delivers almost 
all the benefits of those products at a fraction of the price. 
Worst features 
One thing in Pzizz Relax is the same for every nap and that’s the 
dude’s voice. Although his voice is soothing and mellifluous, I’d love 
the option of other, preferably female, voices.

reQall
 
Free
reQall is a free app that helps you remember all the important things in 
your life. Or, as its App Store Application Description so aptly puts it, 
“reQall is a voice-enabled memory aid that seamlessly integrates your 
iPhone, e-mail, text messaging, and instant messaging into a powerful orga-
nizer, reminder system, and productivity assistant.” Whew. I couldn’t have 
said it better myself, which is why I quoted the App Store description. 
I know what you’re thinking: “Another app that claims it’ll help me 
organize my life. Yawn.” But reQall is smart and different from most 
organizer apps.
For one thing, although you can add items by typing them into the 
reQall app, you can also add them by voice, which is what I prefer. I tap 
the big blue + (plus sign) button that’s in the upper-right corner of every 
reQall screen and say, for example, “Buy Lisa some flowers tonight.”
Then the real magic begins. reQall first translates my words into text 
and then it does several cool things: 
 
1. Because the first word is “buy,” reQall puts this item on my 
reQall shopping list, as shown in the figure on the left. 
 
2. Because the message also includes the word “tonight,” reQall 
also puts this item on my to-do list for today. 
 
3. Because I have set up reQall to e-mail me a copy of every 
reminder, a few minutes later I receive an e-mail message 
that reads, “buy Lisa some flowers tonight.” The e-mail also 
includes the audio recording just in case the speech-to-text 
translation didn’t come out right.
Usually, the voice recordings are spot on. In fact, one of the things 
I like best about reQall is that it translates what I say into text with 
close to 100% accuracy.
reQall also understands other words, such as ask, tell, remind, meet, 
meeting, today, tomorrow, yesterday, the days of the week, dates, and 
times (11:00 a.m., for example). reQall can even create a recurring 
event if you start your recording with the words “each” or “every.”
Furthermore, e-mail is only one of the options for receiving reminders. 
You can also have reminders sent via SMS text message, instant mes-
sage, or push notification on your iPhone.
reQall enables you to share reminders with others and understands 
names when you speak them. So I can say something like, “Ask Lisa to 
Chapter 11: Productivity 

135
check on our book order at Amazon.com.” Because Lisa and her e-mail 
address are in my reQall contacts list, she receives an e-mail with the 
message and voice recording.
The icons you see along the bottom of the screen in the figure on the 
left represent different ways of organizing your reminder items. Jogger 
displays the Memory Jogger screen, a continuously updated summary of 
important items or items reQall thinks you may have forgotten. The Time 
screen displays items due today, soon (within seven days), later (beyond 
soon), and those items that are overdue. The Things screen contains 
to-do items, shopping list items, and notes. And the People screen shows 
people in your contacts and items you’ve shared with them. If you tap 
the little green check mark just above the People icon, you see a list of all 
recent reQall items, as shown in the figure on the right.
I have more to say about reQall, but my editor tells me I’m almost 
out of space. In closing, let me say everything I’ve described thus 
far is free, but for $2.99 per month or $24.99 per year, you can buy 
reQall Pro, which provides additional features such as reminders by 
SMS message and the capability to add items via e-mail. Visit www.
reqall.com/about/compare_pro_standard for details.
Best features 
It’s free and does all the things I described above quite well.
Worst features 
Occasionally voice-to-text translations take 30 minutes or more.

Instapap er Free
 
Free
Have you ever happened upon a Web page with a long and interesting 
story you really want to read but don’t have the time? Or have you 
wished you could somehow stick the story in your pocket and read 
it during the train ride home, on the airplane, or at some other down 
time? If that has ever happened to you, you’re going to love Instapaper 
Free, an app that lets you save Web pages so you can read them later 
with or without an Internet connection.
There’s also Instapaper Pro ($4.99), which includes additional features 
such as folders, tilt-to-scroll, subscriptions, and more.
 
iTranslate
 
Free
It’s true that you can use Safari to visit the free Google Translate Web 
service (http://translate.google.com/#), which can translate 
words, Web pages, and documents to and from more than 50 languages. 
For words and sentences (but not Web pages or documents) the free 
iTranslate app is easier to use, has smart auto correction and auto 
capitalization for better translation quality, and is prettier. It also 
auto-detects the language you’re typing, remembers the last languages 
you used, and offers a choice of font sizes.You may prefer iTranslate 
Plus, which costs $1.99 and includes landscape mode support and a 
favorites list.
 
Pastie
 
$2.99 US
Pastie is a handy little app that lets you save commonly used expres-
sions and messages — called “pasties” — for use in e-mail or SMS 
messages. You can also copy pasties to the clipboard to use in any 
iPhone app that supports copy and paste. You can even associate a 
pastie with a specific contact so you could, for example, send your 
wife an e-mail message that says, “I’m on my way. . . need anything 
at the store?” with one tap.
If you’re not sure you’ll like this app, try Pastie Lite, which is free but 
limits you to three pasties and two favorites.

ProPrompter
 
$9.99 US
If you speak in front of an audience or video camera, you’ll love 
ProPrompter. Made by professional Teleprompter manufacturer 
Bodelin Technologies, ProPrompter turns your iPhone into a smooth-
scrolling, professional quality Teleprompter. You can load scripts 
by e-mail, by using copy and paste, or via the free ProPrompter 
Producer Web site. The app provides complete control over fonts, 
font sizes, background colors, mirroring (for camera-top use like a 
real Teleprompter), cue points for fast access to specific parts of your 
speech, and on-the-fly scroll speed adjustment. 
If you need a Teleprompter, ProPrompter does an excellent job and is 
a steal at just $9.99.
 Use Your Handwriting
 
Free
Yes, Use Your Handwriting is yet another to-do list organizer/reminder 
type app. But this one has a unique twist: You can’t type notes or even 
speak them. Instead, as the app’s name implies, when you use Use 
Your Handwriting, you write your notes by hand. You actually write 
with your finger, not your hand, but you get the picture. You’ll love 
the way the screen scrolls to let you write whole sentences. 
If you hate typing on your iPhone’s cramped keyboard or just have 
really nice handwriting (fingerwriting?), Use Your Handwriting may be 
the best choice for your list-making and reminder needs.

Art Envi Deluxe
 
 
 $3.99 US
Having Art Envi Deluxe is like having the 
history of art in pictures and words on 
your iPhone. The app includes works by 
hundreds of artists, which are organized 
alphabetically by artist and also by periods 
that include Byzantine, Gothic, Baroque, 
Renaissance, Impressionism, and Modern. 
The app also offers sections on ancient art 
and Asian art.
Regardless of how you choose to explore 
the art — alphabetically or by period — 
you can find a dozen or more works by 
each artist arranged in a Web Show. In the 
figure on the left, I’m watching a Web Show 
about Rembrandt.
Art Envi Deluxe offers myriad options for viewing Web Shows. You can 
choose your favorite transition or allow the app to select an appropri-
ate one. You can turn on the Ken Burns effect to provide the illusion of 
motion. You can view thumbnails of all the artwork in a show and tap 
individual pictures to see them. You can speed up, slow down, stop, 
or reverse the show at any time, and you can enlarge, shrink, or rotate 
any picture. You can turn captions on or off or display them briefly 
when a picture first appears. You can add music from your iTunes 
music library to any show, or you can delete any image and never see 
it again. 
That’s not all, though. You can also save any image from the app to 
your iPhone’s Camera Roll or set any image as your wallpaper back-
ground. Another option lets you link from any image to the Web site 
from which it originated so that you can read additional facts and see 
other images. Of course, Art Envi Deluxe also includes detailed infor-
mation about each artist, as shown in the figure on the right. For what 
it’s worth, the text you see in the figure is merely the first of 29 pages 
of information about Rembrandt.

I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that there’s also a non-deluxe version 
of this app, called Art Envi, that’s only 99¢. At only $3.99 for the Deluxe 
version, however, you get nearly 100 more artists, more artwork by 
many of the artists, the capability to save images, and a faster display. 
If art isn’t your thing, there are dozens of other Envi apps:  Architect 
Envi, Astronaut Envi, Amusement Park Envi, Antique Car Envi, Aston 
Martin Envi, Ferrari Envi, Ballpark Envi, Cat Envi, Comic Envi, Dog 
Envi, and at least one hundred other Envi apps. You can also get a free 
Envi Sampler that’s a great way to find out if you enjoy the Envi experi-
ence enough to pay for one of the Envi apps.
Best features
Art Envi Deluxe is beautiful, flexible, scholarly, and fun. If you like to 
look at art or learn about it, you’ll find an ample supply of artwork and 
information in Art Envi Deluxe.
Worst features
Because all the images are pulled from Web sites, the app is more 
or less useless if you don’t have Internet access. Some pictures load 
slowly or don’t load at all, depending upon Web traffic and the origi-
nating site’s status, although this shortcoming isn’t the fault of Art 
Envi Deluxe.

G oogle Mobile App
 
Free
According to its App Store description, “Google Mobile App is the 
fastest, easiest way to search Google.” I’m usually not much for hyper-
bole, but I think the App Store’s description is an understatement. 
Here’s why: I  have big, fat fingers. I type at least 60 words per minute 
on the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 on my desk, but on an 
iPhone, I’m lucky to type six words per minute. An app that helps me 
get things done and saves me keystrokes — as Google Mobile App 
does — is a winner in my book (and, as it turns out, in this book).
Just launch Google Mobile App and hold your iPhone next to your ear. 
When you hear the tone, say what you want to search for. Really. You 
don’t have to tap any buttons or do anything else. The app is super 
smart and uses your iPhone’s proximity sensor to determine when 
it’s next to your face. It then uses your iPhone microphone to deter-
mine when you’re speaking, what you said, and when you’re finished. 
Finally, it translates your speech into a Google search query and per-
forms the search. 
You can be extremely specific. For example, I told the app I wanted 
to see “pictures of the University of Texas tower at night,” and that’s 
exactly what Google Mobile App found for me, as you can see in the 
figure on the left.
Google Mobile App’s voice recognition engine is extremely good. I said 
such things as “names of the members of Spinal Tap,” “shepherd’s pie 
recipe,” “price of a 30-inch Apple Cinema Display,” and “James Bond 
Aston Martin,” and Google Mobile App translated every word correctly.
But wait! There’s more! Even if you prefer typing to talking, are in a noisy 
location, lost your voice, or have a mouth numbed by Novocain, Google 
Mobile App is still the fastest and easiest way to search. In fact, when you 
type your query rather than speaking it, Google Mobile offers suggestions 
as you type, as shown in the figure on the right. For that picture I typed 
the word auto, and Google suggested Rational Automotive (a nearby auto 
repair shop that happened to be in my Address Book), a search for auto 
near my location, autotrader, autozone, and so on.
Did I mention that Google Mobile App is available in English, Chinese, 
Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and at least 
half a dozen other languages? No? Well, it is.

And one last thing . . . an apps button at the bottom of the screen 
offers one-tap access to most Google apps and services includ-
ing Gmail, Calendar, Talk, Docs, Tasks, Reader, GOOG-411, News, 
Notebook, Photos, Translate, Maps, and YouTube. 
This is one of the coolest apps of all time. Its voice recognition prow-
ess is as good as or better than any other speech-to-text application I 
know of, and I’m not comparing it only to iPhone apps, either. Google 
Mobile App does a better job recognizing speech than many Mac and 
PC programs — even some that require extensive user training. You 
can’t beat the price, either; the app is free!
Best features
What’s best about Google Mobile App? It’s free; it understands 
pretty much anything you say; it translates your words into text with 
uncanny accuracy; and then it searches the Web for your query with-
out any further intervention — not even a single tap — on your part. 
So everything about it is great except. . . . 
Worst features 
. . . the history feature remembers only your six most recent queries. 
For an app that’s extremely excellent in every other respect, this limi-
tation seems kind of lame.

Ox ford Deluxe — ODE & OTE 
 
with Audio
 
$54.99 US
The Oxford Deluxe app weighs in at more than 300 megabytes and 
includes the full text of the Oxford Dictionary of English (ODE), Second 
Edition, and the Oxford Thesaurus of English (OTE), Second Edition. 
The app also has high-quality audio recordings with more than 55,000 
pronunciations. According to the publisher, it’s the largest Oxford 
English reference available on any mobile platform.
I know you’re probably thinking that $54.99 is a lot to pay for a diction-
ary and thesaurus, and you’re right. But consider this: The hardcover 
second editions of the ODE and OTE have more than 3,000 pages; 
weigh 12 pounds; and have a combined cost of more than $100. Of 
course, because the ODE and OTE are actual books (what a concept!), 
they don’t come with any audio recordings or fit in your pants pocket 
with room to spare for your wallet. 
Not all dictionaries and thesauri are created equal. You can find plenty 
of decent dictionary apps, and some of them (including the Dictionary.
com Dictionary & Thesaurus app described later in this chapter) are 
even free. If price is your only criteria for judging a dictionary, one of 
the free apps is probably good enough for you. If you are more con-
cerned with accuracy and completeness, desire a superb user interface 
with unique and helpful features, and are willing to pay for a quality 
product, the Oxford Deluxe app is absolutely worth every penny. 
As a writer, I have found the Oxford Deluxe app has many features that 
appeal to me. For example, I can use a question mark as a wild card 
search character if I’m not sure of a word’s spelling, as shown in the 
picture on the left. Not all dictionary apps let me use wild card charac-
ters. In addition, I don’t know of any other dictionary at any price that 
includes audio pronunciations, much less really good ones.
You can tap on almost any word in any definition in the dictionary or 
any synonym in the thesaurus to look up that word. I can bookmark 
pages to keep them handy while I work on a project. The app auto-
matically keeps track of every word I look at and maintains them in 
separate histories for the dictionary and thesaurus. Plus, the history 
function doesn’t appear to have an arbitrary limit; I used this app 
heavily for many days and every word I looked at is still available in 
the appropriate history tab. Finally, unlike most other reference apps, 
the Oxford Deluxe app doesn’t require an Internet connection, so I can 
refer to it in places where many other reference apps would fail. 
Chapter 12: Reference 

143
In addition to more than 300,000 words, phrases, definitions, and 
biographical references, the Oxford Deluxe app includes more than 
a dozen useful appendices, such as Countries of the World; States of 
the USA; Prime Ministers and Presidents; Kings and Queens; Weights, 
Measures, and Notation; Chemical Elements; Proofreading Marks; and 
Guide to Good English.
Although there are many things I like about the Oxford Deluxe app, 
there are a couple things that I don’t much care for. I understand that 
Oxford is in England and this is an English dictionary in the strictest 
sense of the word, but I wish the app didn’t use British spellings such as 
defence instead of defense and colour instead of color (although the pro-
nunciation sounds okay to my American ear). Take a peek at the figure 
on the right to see what the app returned when I looked up color.
The other thing that bothers me is that words in the thesaurus don’t 
include audio pronunciations even if the dictionary includes a pronun-
ciation for the same word. That’s just lazy. 
Best features
The Oxford Deluxe app is comprehensive, authoritative, and easy to use; 
it doesn’t require Internet access; and it includes audio pronunciations.
Worst features
British spellings take precedence.

Wikipanion/Wikipanion Plus 
 
Fre e/$4.99 US
Wikipanion and Wikipanion Plus are apps that make it easier to search 
and use Wikipedia. If you’re not familiar with Wikipedia, it’s the huge, 
crowd-sourced (meaning anyone can edit any article), free, online 
encyclopedia that includes more than three million articles (www.
wikipedia.org). Wikipedia is not the last word on any topic, given the 
fact that anyone can edit articles. However, Wikipedia contributors are 
good about self-policing, so inaccuracies, slanted reporting, or worse 
generally don’t last long before a conscientious user replaces the entry. 
You can use Wikipedia with your iPhone’s Safari Web browser. In fact, 
you should give that a try right now. Go ahead, I’ll wait. . . 
Now you know what Wikipedia looks like in Safari. Even though what you 
used was the special mobile version of Wikipedia that only appears if you 
reach the site using your iPhone (or other Web-enabled device), it’s not 
exactly optimized for convenience, which is where the Wikipanion apps 
shine.
Both Wikipanion and Wikipanion Plus are crammed full of features that 
make it faster and easier for you to find what you need in Wikipedia. For 
example, one feature is smart text completion, which offers you sug-
gested entries based on what you type. For example, when I type Led Z 
in the search field, the list of possible matches includes Led Zeppelin, 
Led Zeppelin concerts, Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings, Led Zeppelin IV, 
and so on. I tap the first entry, Led Zeppelin, and the resulting page is 
shown in the figure on the left.
Another advantage of using Wikipanion is that most lengthy entries 
include a table of contents, which lets you jump right to the informa-
tion you need without making you wade through a bunch of informa-
tion you don’t care about. There’s also in-page searching that enables 
you to find a word or phrase and jump right to it. 
One of my favorite features is that links to other items related in some 
way to the article you’re reading are only a tap away, as shown in the 
figure on the right. I find the links invaluable for brainstorming and 
discovering useful information I might never have thought of. 
Other helpful features found in both Wikipanion and Wikipanion Plus 
include 
 
✓ Bookmarks that can remember both the entries you view, as well 
as the specific sections of the entries
 
✓ History entries for as many as 100 items
 
✓ Dual language searching
Chapter 12: Reference 

145
 
✓  Interactive font resizing
 
✓ Integrated Wiktionary (Wikipedia’s free dictionary and thesaurus) 
lookups
 
✓ Integrated audio playback with support for the Ogg vorbis 
audio format used in some Wikipedia entries and Wiktionary 
pronunciations
 
✓ No advertising
In addition to all of the above, Wikipanion Plus has two other features 
that many users (myself included) think are worth $5. The first is a queue. 
When this feature is enabled, any links you tap go on the queue list instead 
of being opened immediately. I like the queue feature because I can finish 
reading the main article and view the related items later, which means I 
don’t have to do a lot of flipping back and forth. The page saver feature in 
Wikipanion Plus is the one I find most appealing. With it I can manually or 
automatically save articles and links in my queue for offline reading. This 
rocks because, like many reference apps, Wikipanion and Wikipanion Plus 
are virtually worthless when you don’t have an Internet connection.
Best features
Both versions of the app make it faster and easier to search for things 
in Wikipedia; the queue and page saver in Wikipanion Plus make using 
Wikipedia on the iPhone even better.
Worst features
You can’t do searches with Wikipanion or Wikipanion Plus unless you 
have Internet access.

The World Factbook
 
$3.99 US
The  World Factbook app is the definitive source of reliable informa-
tion about the nations of the world. It contains up-to-date information 
about more than 250 countries and territories, and it has a fast and 
easy-to-use interface.
The app works almost exactly like Safari, with forward and back buttons, 
bookmarks, and a history feature. The information provided for each 
nation includes the flag, a map of the location, and nine categories of 
information: Introduction, Geography, People, Government, Economy, 
Communications, Transportation, Military, and Transnational Issues.
The Geography category provides information such as the country’s 
general location, geographic coordinates, land mass and boundaries, 
climate, and terrain, as shown in the figure on the left. The Geography 
category also includes a substantial amount of information on interna-
tional agreements the country has signed.
The People category describes the nation’s population by size, age, 
growth, birth and death rates, life expectancy, ethnicity, religion, lan-
guages, and dozens of other facts about the nation’s indigenous people.
In the Government category, you can find data about the country’s 
type of government, its capital, administrative divisions, national holi-
days, legal system, age of suffrage, and a detailed description of the 
branches of its government, political parties and leaders, and its diplo-
matic representation to and from the U.S.
The Economy category begins with a few tightly written paragraphs 
about the nation’s economic situation. That’s followed by a mind-
numbing list of statistics and figures that includes several measures 
of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), labor force makeup and unemploy-
ment rate, information about income and investments, public debt, 
annual national budget, lending and discount rates, major industries, 
agricultural products, energy, imports and exports, and tons of addi-
tional economic data. 
The Communications category covers infrastructure, the number of 
land and mobile cellular telephone lines in use, description of the tele-
phone system, plus detailed information about radio and television 
stations, Internet hosts, and Internet users.
The Transportation category includes information on airports and 
their runway lengths, as well as key data for pipelines, heliports, rail-
ways, roads, ports, and terminals.
Chapter 12: Reference 

147
The Military category discusses (what else?) the nation’s military — 
its branches, service age, service obligation, manpower available for 
and fit for military service, and military expenditures. 
Finally, the Transnational Iss ues category is where you find informa-
tion about disputes the nation is currently involved in, its refugees 
and internally displaced persons, illicit drug activity, and other bits of 
information that don’t fit cleanly into any of the other categories.
Unlike some reference apps, The World Factbook does not require 
Internet access, but it only consumes about 10MB of space on your 
iPhone. Furthermore, the publisher regularly provides free updates to 
the data.
If you’re involved in any kind of international business or product market-
ing, plan to travel abroad, are a writer of fiction or non-fiction books with 
an international orientation, or are just a person who likes to have facts at 
your fingertips, The World Factbook is just the ticket.
Best features
The World Factbook contains an incredible amount of detailed infor-
mation, uses a tiny fraction of your iPhone’s storage capacity, doesn’t 
require Internet access, and is fast and easy to use.
Worst features
The only graphics included are the nation’s flag and a map. More 
images are the only thing I can think of that would make this app 
better than it already is.

Dial  Zero
 
Free
Wouldn’t it be nice to call a company’s customer service hot line and 
know exactly which keys to press to skip immediately to a live person? 
If you think so, you’re going to love the free Dial Zero app, which lets 
you skip all those annoying recorded voice prompts and jump straight 
to a living being without delay. With listings for more than 600 compa-
nies and lots of comments by users, you not only can skip the boring 
blather, but you may even pick up a tip or two for successfully dealing 
with the company’s service personnel. 
 
Dicti onary.com Dictionary 
 
& Thesaurus
 
Free
This app is probably the best of the free dictionary and thesaurus 
apps currently available. It includes world-class reference content 
from Dictionary.com and Thesaurus.com with more than 275,000 
definitions and 80,000 synonyms, and it even has audio pronuncia-
tions. Furthermore, although the audio, Word of the Day, and similarly 
spelled words features do require Internet access, the dictionary and 
thesaurus don’t. That means you can have most of the app’s function-
ality even when you don’t have a network connection.
Dictionary.com Dictionary & Thesaurus is not as comprehensive as 
the Oxford Deluxe app, but it’s still a terrific resource. And you sure 
can’t complain about the price since it’s free.
 
The Elements of Style 
 
By William Strunk, Jr.
 
$0.99 US
I think The Elements of Style — written in 1918 by William Strunk Jr. 
and E.B. White — is the best style guide ever for anyone who wants 
to learn to write proper American English. I keep a copy of the book 

149
 Chapter 12: Reference
within arm’s reach at all times, and I read it cover to cover (it’s fewer 
than 100 pages) at least once each year. With simple yet practical 
advice such as “omit needless words” and “use the active voice,” 
and clear, concise examples, you should absolutely keep this app (or 
paperback) handy if anything you write will be read by others. 
 
MathRef
 
$0.99 US
If you’re into math and would like a handy pocket reference with 
more than 1,000 formulas, figures, tips, and examples of equations 
and concepts, MathRef may be the best 99¢ you ever spend. With 
categories for algebra, geometry, trigonometry, linear algebra, series 
and sequences, derivatives, integration, vector calculus, differential 
equations, prime numbers, and more, it packs a lot of helpful info in 
an inexpensive and easy-to-use app.
Check the App Store for these categories that are currently listed as 
“coming soon”: basic chemistry, statistics, accounting and financial, 
real estate, equation editor, and quadratic equation solver.
 
Your Rights
 
Free
Do you know your rights in the event government agents detain or 
question you? If you don’t but would like to, this free app is a winner. 
It is based on information provided by the American Civil Liberties 
Union and, although the app isn’t a substitute for good legal counsel, it 
is an excellent overview of your rights if you are stopped, questioned, 
arrested, or searched by a law enforcement officer. Because anything 
you say to an officer can and will be used against you, wouldn’t you 
feel a whole lot better knowing exactly what your rights are in such 
situations?

AppConnect
 
 
 Free
 AppConnect helps you find new apps and 
recommendations of cool apps from other 
app lovers. But that’s not all . . . it also 
shows you apps that are new or popular at 
the App Store. Plus, you can use it to meet 
other app lovers and see what they recom-
mend. My absolute favorite feature is that 
I can receive a notification when the price 
of a specific app is lowered. Best of all, you 
get all this and more absolutely free!
I’d be remiss if I didn’t at least mention 
that plenty of free apps are available to 
help you find cool new iPhone apps, such as AppMiner, PandoraBox, 
BargainBin, AppSniper, and App Gems. There is also at least one Web 
site, Appolicious.com, which attempts to integrate social networking 
with recommendations for iPhone apps. But, in my humble opinion, 
the AppConnect iPhone app is the best mash up of iPhone app recom-
mendations and social networking.
Even if you hate social networking or don’t have any friends, AppConnect 
is still great for finding cool iPhone apps. For example, the figure on the 
left shows the listing of apps on sale and those that are currently free. 
If you tap the Paid button near the top of the screen, you see apps that 
have reduced prices. If you tap the AppPoint button, you see apps that 
are on sale — but in this case they’re ranked by AppConnect user votes.
On the same screen you can also check out new apps and apps that 
are hot (bestsellers). They’re listed by the same criteria as the apps 
on sale, namely Free, Paid, and AppPoint. All this adds up to a lot of 
different ways to discover new, popular, recommended, or discounted 
apps. Then, when you find an app that interests you, you can read 
more about it in AppConnect, or you can tap a button to buy it or read 
more about it in the App Store.

On the social side of things, you can read reviews posted by other 
AppConnect users. When you find users you feel share your taste in 
apps, ask those people to be your friends. After they accept, you’ll see 
an alert any time they post a new app review.
Another thing I like is AppConnect’s capability to track prices on apps 
I’m willing to buy if the price is reduced, such as Madden NFL 10 and 
Rock Band. You can see the Tracking indicator in the figure on the 
right. If any of the ten apps I’m tracking goes on sale, I see an alert 
when I launch AppConnect. 
 Best features
The best thing about AppConnect is that it offers so many ways to 
discover new apps. You can also see what other users recommend, 
and you can recommend your favorite apps to other users. Finally, 
AppConnect notifies you when apps you specify go on sale.
Worst features
I sometimes forget to check AppConnect for days on end, so I wish it 
had push notification that would alert me of price reductions as soon 
as they occur. 
       
 Chapter 13: Social Networking

 BeeJiveIM with Push
 
$ 9.99 US
I f you like to keep in touch with your friends via instant messaging 
(IM), and if you use more than one of the popular instant messaging 
services — AIM, MobileMe, MSN/Windows Live, Yahoo!, GoogleTalk, 
Facebook, My Space, ICQ, and Jabber — you are going to love BeeJiveIM.
An app that lets you use nine different IM services and works beautifully 
regardless of which network your iPhone is using — 3G, EDGE, or WiFi — 
is pretty cool. The capability to use any or all of the services at the same 
time, as shown in the figure on the left, makes BeeJiveIM even cooler. You 
can see that I’m available on all five of the IM services I use (from left to 
right after the word “Online”): MobileMe/AIM, Jabber, MySpace, Yahoo!, 
and Facebook. 
Now check out how my Available message says, “Talk to me. . .” for 
MobileMe, AIM, Jabber, and MySpace. That’s because I’m lazy. If I were 
more ambitious, I could have set a different message for each service, 
or set any or all of them to indicate that I was Away, Busy, or Invisible.
But wait; there’s more! Not only can you chat via nine different IM ser-
vices at once, you can log in using multiple accounts on any or all of 
the services. BeeJiveIM can monitor dozens of accounts on up to nine 
different instant message services at one time.
As long as you have an account with either AIM or Yahoo!, you can 
send messages to any SMS-equipped cell phone without paying a single 
penny to your wireless provider (AT&T in the U.S.). The recipients may 
have to pay the normal cost of SMS messages, but they’d have to pay 
that even if you sent your text messages via AT&T. BeeJiveIM integrates 
with your iPhone address book, so you can choose text message recipi-
ents the same way you would if you used the bundled Messages app 
(with its associated per-message charges from AT&T).
 
The Push in the app’s name means you can close the app and still receive 
alert notifications when messages arrive. Better still, you can choose how 
you want to be notified — by an on-screen alert or by e-mail.
Another cool feature is that BeeJiveIM can send and receive pictures 
and voice notes as long as the IM service you’re using supports it, as 
most of them do.
Last, but definitely not least, BeeJiveIM has the longest list of available 
options I’ve ever seen in a single iPhone app, including groups, meta 
152
Chapter 13: Social Networking 

153
chat, number of messages to preview in lists, auto-correct, auto-
capitalization, and emoticon support.
Oh, there is one more thing: If you use only one or two instant mes-
sage services, you probably don’t need to spend ten bucks on 
BeeJiveIM. Some really nice free clients are available for each of the 
individual services, some of which are featured later in this chapter. 
But if you have friends on all the available services, as shown in the 
figure on the right below, it’s just the ticket.
Best features
This app costs $9.99, but the capability to send and receive SMS text 
messages at no additional cost could be worth a lot more than that to 
you. Plus BeeJiveIM’s capability to access up to nine instant message 
services at once is pretty sweet, as are the push notifications for incom-
ing messages. If free SMS text messages appeal to you, and you’d like 
to use the same app for IMs and free SMS messaging, you may prefer 
BeeJiveIM to a stand-alone free app such as textPlus, which is described 
later in this chapter. Finally, if you prefer e-mail notifications to on-
screen notifications, BeeJiveIM can handle that, too.
Worst features
BeeJiveIM suffers from occasional crashes and push notification 
delays. Fortunately, I experience both issues infrequently and, as far 
as I can tell, only a few other users have reported them.

Skype
 
Free
Sk ype is a service that offers free voice calls and text messages to tens 
of millions of Skype users. There’s no charge for your Skype account 
or for the Skype software, which is available for the iPhone and iPod 
touch as well as Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, Windows Mobile, Nokia 
N800/810, and even the Sony PSP.
After you’ve set up your free account, you can make free Skype-to-
Skype voice calls to any other Skype user anywhere on earth for free. 
You can also chat with other Skype users for free.
What do you do if your friends don’t have Skype? Well, they could 
download and install Skype on their Macs, PCs, iPhones, or whatever, 
and sign up for a free account. If that’s not going to happen for some 
reason, Skype also lets you make calls to landlines and mobile phones 
for low prices.
For example, you can currently sign up for unlimited calls to U.S. and 
Canadian landlines and mobile phones for €2.24 a month (around 
$3.20 US at press time). Or you can get unlimited calls to landlines 
(and some mobiles) in more than 40 countries (as shown in the figure 
on the left) for €8.95 (less than $15 US at press time). Better still, no 
long-term contract is required. If you don’t want to take advantage of 
an unlimited calling plan, you can pay as you go, with á la carte pricing 
starting at less than 5¢ per minute. For example, when our son spent 
the summer in Israel, we called him via Skype (as shown in the figure 
on the right) and paid approximately 3¢ per minute instead of the 
21¢ per minute or more it would have cost via AT&T. 
For a few dollars a month you can even get an inbound Skype phone 
number (known as a SkypeIn number), so anyone can call you on 
Skype from any landline or mobile phone anywhere in the world. 
Other low-cost Skype options include voicemail, SMS messaging, call 
forwarding, and caller ID.
I use SkypeIn for my consulting business and pay about $70 per year 
for all the aforementioned services, unlimited calling to U.S. and 
Canadian landlines and mobile phones, and discounted rates for calls 
to other countries. My technicians and I can check for voicemail using 
the Skype iPhone app and return calls to clients anywhere in the world 
for much less than it would cost to dial via AT&T. 
Chapter 13: Social Networking 

155
There is one notable downside to Skype: At present you can only make 
and receive calls via Wi-Fi. Although most of the other services, includ-
ing voicemail and chat, work fine over EDGE or 3G, voice calling over 
the cellular networks is currently prohibited. That’s the bad news. The 
good news is that on October 6, 2009 AT&T announced it will soon 
take the steps necessary to enable VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) 
apps — such as Skype — on the iPhone, over the 3G network. Nobody 
knows exactly when this will happen, and still no word as this book 
goes to press. Stay tuned.
Best features
Skype has tons of great features. At the top of the list has to be that 
it gives you the capability to call millions of Skype users all over the 
world for free. The reduced rates for calls to landlines and mobile 
phones in other countries are pretty sweet, too, as is the reasonable 
cost for an inbound (SkypeIn) phone number with caller ID, voicemail, 
and call forwarding.
Worst features
Voice calls are currently restricted to Wi-Fi networks and are some-
times less reliable than the same calls made over the AT&T mobile 
network.

 textPlus
 
Free
Under ordinary circumstances, you use the Messages app that comes 
bundled with your iPhone to send and receive SMS text messages. The 
only problem is that only a limited number of text messages (or pos-
sibly none) are included in your iPhone data plan. My AT&T plan in 
the U.S., for example, includes only 200 SMS messages a month. Your 
mileage may vary. 
Well, I happen to have a couple of teen kids who each can easily send 
more than 200 SMS messages a day on a slow day. SMS messages beyond 
the 200 per month that’s part of our plan cost $0.20 each or $15 for 1,500 
a month. Other options include unlimited SMS messages for $20 a month 
per person and unlimited SMS messages for a family for $30.
The bottom line is that SMS messages can get real expensive real fast. 
And that’s what makes the textPlus app a winner. With textPlus, you 
can send and receive unlimited SMS text messages at absolutely no cost 
to you. Recipients pay for their text messages as usual unless they also 
use textPlus, in which case their SMS messages are also completely free. 
Like the Messages app, textPlus has push notification, so it can alert 
you of incoming messages even if textPlus isn’t running. Unlike the 
Messages app, though, textPlus censors your messages, stripping out 
most four-letter words and replacing them with asterisks. textPlus out-
performs other free SMS apps, however, and has a better user inter-
face, so I still recommend it — in spite of the censorship.
textPlus works pretty much the same way the bundled Messages app 
works with a couple of notable exceptions. The first difference, which I 
think is the best, is that you can initiate group conversations with mul-
tiple recipients. It’s great that all of the participants in a conversation 
can see and respond to every subsequent message from every partici-
pant, as shown in the figure on the left.
Another difference is that textPlus is advertiser-supported , so there 
are small ads on most of its screens, like the one for Ps2 Repairs that 
you can see near the bottom of the figure on the left.
The Messages app can send SMS messages to and receive SMS mes-
sages from any cellular network provider, but textPlus only works 
with some of the majors, including AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, 
Alltel, US Cellular, Virgin Mobile, Nextel, Boost, Cellular One, Dobson, 
Cellular South, and CellCom. At this time, other carriers — including 
Chapter 13: Social Networking 

157
MetroPCS and Cricket — are not supported by textPlus, which means 
you can’t use the app to exchange SMS messages with anyone who 
gets service from one of the unsupported carriers. Because you prob-
ably don’t know which carrier your friends use, this could be a prob-
lem for you.
Finally, even though your real name shows up as part of your mes-
sage, the message appears to be coming from a series of random 
numbers instead of your name. The figure on the right shows how a 
message I sent to my wife looked in the Messages app on her iPhone. 
Put another way, what she saw was (606) 110-02; what she should 
have seen in that space was my name.
Best features
The best thing about textPlus is that it provides you with unlimited 
free SMS text messages, but the group conversations and push notifi-
cations are pretty nice, too. 
Worst features
A cou ple of messages I sent never got to their recipient(s). Perhaps 
they were users of an unsupported service, though I never received 
any feedback that they were (or that the recipients never received my 
messages). However, I didn’t find that problem nearly as vexing as the 
fact that this app censors your words.

few years, is a so-called micro-blogging service. It allows users to post short 
messages called tweets. The twist is that a tweet has to be 140 characters 
or fewer, which, thankfully, forces most users to omit needless words.
You can follow people and read their tweets with any Web browser 
at Twitter.com (if you care to check out my tweets, my username is 
“LeVitus”). But, as every Twitter aficionado knows, it’s easier and 
more fun to use Twitter with one of the specialized apps known as 
Twitter clients. 
If you search the iTunes Store for Twitter clients, you’ll find dozens. 
Many are free and most work just fine. After testing more than a dozen 
popular Twitter clients, Tweetie 2 has become my favorite.
 
I’ll tell you about my favorite free Twitter client later in this chapter. 
First and foremost, Tweetie 2’s user interface is beautiful, elegant, 
easy to comprehend, and easy to use. It is designed in such a way that 
any feature I need is just one or two taps away. For example, while 
I’m typing a tweet, I can tap the little button that shows a triangle and 
number (as shown in the figure on the left) to reveal additional options.
 
In the figure, the number 4 on the button indicates that I have used 
136 characters in my tweet and have 4 characters left before I reach 
the 140-character limit. 
When I tap the button, the keyboard retracts and the six buttons shown 
at the bottom of the figure on the left replace it. Suffice it to say that 
those buttons — Camera, Photo Library, Geotag, Usernames, Hashtags, 
and Shrink URLs — represent useful features for composing tweets. 
Another thing that makes Tweetie 2 superior to many other Twitter 
clients is that it works even if you don’t have a network connection. 
So, for example, if you’re on an airplane you can read tweets, reply to 
tweets, compose new tweets, follow or unfollow other users, and even 
specify your favorite tweets. As soon as you have a network connection, 
Chapter 13: Social Networking 

159
everything is synced and your pending tweets are sent and received 
automatically.
Unlike some other Twitter clients, Tweetie 2 lets you save as many draft 
tweets as you like and manages them with aplomb. If you perform many 
searches (as I do), Tweetie 2 lets you save them for reuse and even syncs 
them with the Tweetie 2 client for the Mac (sorry, Windows users). 
Another neat feature is the map view, which uses your iPhone’s GPS 
capabilities to display on a map tweets from nearby Twitter users.
Best features
I can’t think of anything about Tweetie 2 that I don’t like. I love the 
clean user interface (see the figure on the right) and how easy it is to 
access the features I use most. I also love the offline mode, which lets 
me read and write tweets even at 35,000 feet with no network access.
Worst features
I don’t really think there is a worst feature, so I’m going to gripe about 
a feature I’d like to see in a future version of Tweetie 2 — push notifi-
cation for specific messages. For example, if someone sent a message 
to my user name (@LeVitus) or replied to a tweet I had posted, I’d love 
to have my iPhone alert me immediately. I don’t know of any other 
Twitter clients that have this feature, so maybe it’s technically impos-
sible, but it sure would be nice.

 AIM
 
Free/$2 .99 US
AIM is  the official client app for the AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) 
service. If you don’t want to shell out $2.99, you can choose an ad-
supported free version.
Aside from the ads in the free version, the two versions are the same. 
With either version you can post photos, send and receive free SMS 
text messages, find out if your buddies are nearby, and chat with 
anyone on the AIM network worldwide (which includes AOL, AIM, ICQ, 
.Mac, and MobileMe users).
If you don’t use other instant messaging services (such as MSN/
Windows Live, Yahoo!, GoogleTalk, Facebook, My Space, or Jabber), 
the AIM app may be the only IM client you ever need.
 Facebook
 
Free
If you  visit Facebook (www.facebook.com) using your iPhone’s 
Safari Web browser, I’ve got a treat for you. The free Facebook app 
does everything you can do in a Web browser but is designed specifi-
cally for your iPhone’s 3.5-inch touch screen. It also includes iPhone-
specific features, such as displaying on the app’s icon the number of 
notifications you have waiting. The Facebook app has comprehensive 
photo-management tools so you can add and delete albums and 
photos, as well as upload photos and videos (iPhone 3GS only).
Download this free app and I virtually guarantee you’ll never again use 
Safari on your iPhone to visit Facebook. 
 MySpace Mobile
 
Free
If you  visit MySpace (www.myspace.com) using your iPhone’s Safari 
Web browser, I have a treat for you. Like the Facebook app I described 
in the preceding section, the MySpace Mobile app makes it easier 
to send and receive MySpace messages, see your friends’ statuses, 

 Chapter 13: Social Networking
161
update your status, upload photos, post comments, and search for 
friends. Where Safari is difficult to use and requires a lot of precise 
tapping and zooming in and out, the MySpace Mobile app has a sleek 
user interface designed to make things easier to do on an iPhone. 
If you use MySpace, even occasionally, you’re going to love the free 
MySpace Mobile app.
 Twitterific
 
Free/$3.99 US
Twitterific is another Twitter clien t app, and I must say that Twitterific 
is also an apt description of the app. (See the description of Tweetie 
2 earlier in the chapter to find out more about Twitter.) In fact, if I 
wasn’t so happy with Tweetie 2, I’d probably use Twitterific. 
As with the AIM client app, there’s an ad-supported free version of 
Twitterific, as well as an ad-free version that costs $3.99. Both versions 
are feature-rich, with unified timelines that include replies, direct mes-
sages, and favorites, plus filtering and customizable visual themes and 
layouts. 
If you’re not ready to spend money on a Twitter client, the free ver-
sion of Twitterific is just the ticket.
 Yelp
 
Free
Yelp (www.yelp.com) helps you find g reat places to eat, shop, and 
do much more in dozens of U.S. cities. The Yelp iPhone app does the 
same thing, and it also helps you find great restaurants, bars, and 
other businesses that are near your current location.
When you find a business that interests you, a single tap lets you see 
its location, get driving directions, dial its phone number, visit its Web 
site, or read reviews written by local Yelp users. And because it’s an 
iPhone app, many reviews include pictures of the food or services.
My family has discovered a lot of great restaurants and stores with 
Yelp, and we wholeheartedly recommend this app.

ESPN ScoreCenter
 
 
 Free (ad supported)
You know, ESPN has been kicking sports 
butt since it burst onto the scene as one of 
the first all-sports cable networks in 1979. 
Although I’ll be the first to admit that I’m not 
the world’s biggest sports nut — hey, I’m 
Dr. Mac, not Dr. J! — a lot of what I do enjoy 
seems to be involved with ESPN in one way 
or another. So, ESPN’s iPhone app — ESPN 
ScoreCenter, a play on the network’s signa-
ture TV show SportsCenter — had a high bar 
to meet when I checked it out. I’m here to tell 
you that it cleared that bar, and then some.
First and foremost, I love that I get some 
sports trivia and history when I first launch 
the app. On the loading screen right under-
neath the logo, you get two lines of information. And this isn’t just stuff 
that’s loaded into the app that you’ll cycle through faster than you can 
say, “Pass the ball”: At least some of it is current information that’s 
coming off the company’s servers. I know I’m an information junkie, but 
I just think it’s cool when an iPhone app can keep me engaged while it’s 
still loading!
After the app is loaded, you’ll find a very comprehensive app for keep-
ing up-to-date with all the scores for your favorite teams across the 
NFL, Major League Baseball (MLB), the NBA, the WNBA, NCAA foot-
ball, basketball, baseball, lacrosse, volleyball, water polo, NASCAR, 
Formula 1, IndyCar, golf, tennis, soccer/football, and even cricket and 
rugby. That’s just pretty much nuts! The company says on iTunes that 
“much more” is in store for the future, if you can believe that.
Check out the figure on the left. It’s the results for week 12 of the 
2009/2010 NFL season. The Dallas Cowboys and Oakland Raiders are in 
the big square at the top, and that’s because I set the Cowboys as my 
favorite team. Scores are displayed for all three games that were played 
on Thanksgiving, and below that are the matchups coming later on 
Sunday of that week, including the team’s win/loss record, the time the 
game will be played, and the team logos. If I tap any of those squares, I 
either get the results and stats for the game with another link to a game 
wrap-up if the game has been played, or I get season/preview stats with 
a link to a game preview for games that have yet to be played.

In the figure on the right, you see the results for the Stanford Cardinal 
women’s basketball game against the Utah Utes. The score, top per-
formers (some games have more information on this screen than 
others), and a link to the deeper Recap are all displayed.
 
I found the women’s games to have fewer stats in the opening window. 
But if you click through to the ESPN Mobile Web Recap, you can find 
everything you might be looking for: stats, game summary, and recap. 
In fact, this is true for just about every kind of game, so don’t be afraid 
to poke around in the app if there’s something you’re expecting to find 
that’s not readily apparent.
You can set up pages for whatever sports interest you with favorite 
teams for each, and you can tie into myESPN for syncing up your 
ScoreCenter teams with your online myESPN account. Unlike a lot of 
apps from large media companies, however, you aren’t required to 
have an account to get the most out of it.
Best features
This app has an awesome interface, is intuitive, and has compre-
hensive score coverage of just about everything. I’ve been seriously 
impressed by this app.
Worst features
I couldn’t find a way to quickly get back to the top of long lists of 
scores. I should be able to double-tap the title bar on any individual 
page to jump back up to the top.
       
 Chapter 14: Sports

 
Fox Sports Mobile
 
Free (ad supported)
Fox Sports Mobile doesn’t cover nearly as many different types of 
sports as ESPN ScoreCenter, but it offers deeper coverage of those 
sports that are there, including news, videos, stats, standings, and 
team information. This app offers a lot of stuff!
When you first launch the app, you get the Home screen. This is a 
general sporting information page with recent Fox Sports news stories 
and videos and a link to Scores.
 
To get to specific sports (or a different sport if you’re already in an 
individual sport), tap the Scores button on the Home screen, or tap 
the button in the top-right corner that is confusingly labeled with the 
current sport, but is really a link to the list of sports offered in the app.
If you tap the Scores tab, you are presented with a list of 14 different 
sports covered in the app as of this writing. These include the NFL, 
MLB, NASCAR, NCAA football, NCAA men’s and women’s basketball, 
the NBA, the NHL, soccer/football, golf, tennis, mixed martial arts, 
boxing, and the WNBA. Like I said, it’s not as comprehensive a list as 
ESPN ScoreCenter, but it’s still a lot of sports coverage.
Pick one and you get a new page dedicated to that sport, complete 
with a new set of dedicated tabs at the bottom of the screen (see the 
figure on the left) for News, Scores, Teams, Standings, and More.
 
To get back to the home page with general sports articles and videos, 
tap the button in the top right of the screen and choose Home from 
the list of sports.
It’s pretty obvious what News and Scores are, but tap through to the 
Teams tab, where you can find a list of all the teams in the sport or 
sporting league you’re in — in this case, the NFL. Pick a team, say 
the Arizona Cardinals, and you’re taken to a page dedicated to that 
team, with News, Schedule, Stats, and Roster subtabs at the top of the 
screen.
News offers what you’d expect, a list of recent news articles that 
pertain to the Cardinals, but we also get items like a cheat sheet that 
includes what is best described as handicapper advice, and several 
different kinds of reports, so dig around in the News subtab to see 
what you can discover. The other subtabs are self-explanatory.
164
Chapter 14: Sports 

165
If you go back to the main tabs for each sporting category, you can 
check out the Stats tab, which is a list of the top 12 performers in the 
various stats pertinent to the game. In the NBA, for instance, you can 
see some 14 different stats from assist/turnover ratio to turnovers per 
game. To choose a new stat, tap the button at the top of the screen, 
which you can see in the figure on the right, for a slot machine wheel 
with all 14 stats covered in this sport. Spin the wheel to the stat you 
want, tap Select, and you’re taken to it.
Each of the sports covered offers different levels of coverage — mixed 
martial arts and boxing, for instance, only offered a News tab at the 
time of this writing — but this changes depending on what’s going 
on in that individual sport at any given time. That’s the beauty of a 
dynamic iPhone app that pulls a lot of its content from the Internet.
Best features
Fox Sports Mobile offers plenty of deep coverage on a variety of major 
sports.
Worst features
To get from sport to sport, you tap the button in the top-right corner 
(see either figure below), which is labeled with the sport you are cur-
rently in. That’s unintuitive (and frankly silly), but it’s a small nit-pick 
for an otherwise solid app. I should also mention that Fox Sports 
Mobile relies on simple lists for a lot of features, which is a bit plain to 
look at.

JIRBO Paper Football Signature 
 
Edition
 
$4.99 US
I remember spending a lot of time playing paper football in the lunch-
room when I was a kid. I’d work on making the perfect paper football, 
which involves taking a half sheet of notebook paper and folding it 
in such a way that results in a thick triangle of tightly folded paper. 
I always wanted mine to have nice sharp corners, and of course you 
wanted to do it in such a way that it wouldn’t come unfolded as you 
played. Ahh, the good ol’ days, but who has time for such shenanigans 
today? Maybe kids today still play paper football, but with iPods and 
iPhones as ubiquitous today as Trapper notebooks were when I was a 
kid, I suspect there are fewer paper footballers today than at any time 
since the game was invented.
But I digress from my digression, which was to explain how the game 
is played. You and your opponent sit on opposite sides of a table, and 
you take turns flicking your paper football with the goal of getting it to 
stop with part of it hanging off the edge of the table without knocking 
it off. That’s called a touchdown, and it’s worth 6 points. After a touch-
down you can try for an extra point by having your opponent make a 
goal with his fingers, while you try to knock the football through the 
air between his (or her!) fingers. If you do, that’s an extra point.
Today we live in more digital times, and thanks to JIRBO, we can engage 
in a game of paper football without the risk of kicking our paper foot-
ball onto the guy’s desk three cubicles down or having to ask the head 
cheerleader if she wouldn’t mind fetching your football out of her pud-
ding. No, with JIRBO Paper Football Signature Edition, the only thing 
you risk is someone looking over your shoulder, calling you a dork, and 
then sitting down and asking if they can play the winner.
The object in this game is the same as the analog version: You want to 
flick your paper football across the table so that part of it is hanging over 
the edge. To do so, you start your sliding motion with your fingertip on 
the table, and then slide it toward the paper football. When your finger 
contacts the paper football, it moves. The faster you slide your finger, the 
farther the ball goes. Too soft, and it won’t move much, whereas sliding 
it too hard sends the paper football over the edge of the table. The direc-
tion of your slide and angle of incidence when it contacts the paper foot-
ball determine the direction it slides across the table.
If you score a touchdown — see the figure on the left — the game 
enters Kick mode, where you can try and score an extra point, as you 
Chapter 14: Sports 

167
can see in the figure on the right. Direction and strength-of-contact 
with your slide really matter here.
You can play against the computer or in two-player mode with both 
players getting a side of the iPhone, just like in real life across a table. 
The game also tracks worldwide high scores from other players, 
where you can see some pretty outrageous scores.
 
If you’re having trouble with your kicks, you can practice kicking in 
the Kick Mode tab, where you can kick again and again against an 
always-patient opponent who doesn’t mind being your goal post until 
you’re done practicing.
There’s a free (ad supported) version of the game, too, where games 
are time-limited.
Best features
It’s fun, and it will take you back to those days of playing paper foot-
ball in the school cafeteria.
Worst features
Limited physics make such moves as the spinning football all but 
impossible, and don’t get me started on how a paper football balances 
with 98% of it hanging over the edge!

MLB.com At Bat
 
$9.99 US during season
 
Free during off-season
I’m writing this after the World Series of 2009 is over, but MLB.com At 
Bat was a fantastic app during the 2009 season and post-season. Take 
a look at what you get for free during the off-season.
During the off-season, you get news, video, team information, and all 
the stats from the previous season, which is just perfect for you base-
ball junkies whiling away the hours until spring training arrives.
The News tab offers you a news feed of everything baseball-related in 
chronological order. Off-season trades, speculation, house cleaning 
and reorganizations, financial news: It’s all there. The Videos tab is 
comprised of recent short clips as found on MLB.com, and the Teams 
tab is simply a way to get your news filtered by individual teams. You 
also find links to each team’s Web site, which open in Safari. In the 
More tab, you find all those past-season stats, league standings, an 
FAQ for the app, and your settings.
But it’s during the baseball season that MLB.com At Bat really shines, 
with live streaming video, real-time box scores, and game stats, as 
shown in the figure on the left, and much more.
For example, not only can you listen to radio broadcasts, but you 
often have a choice of the home or away team broadcast! That’s way 
cool. If you have a favorite team, you can even have MLB.com At Bat 
always choose your team’s audio feed.
My favorite feature, however, is that for games with video (usually two 
a day), you get to choose from different camera feeds. It’s like being 
the director and calling your own shots! For most games, the feeds 
include Centerfield, Tight Centerfield, Blimp Cam, High Home Plate, 
Low First Base, Low Third Base, plus a Slow-Mo Replay view and Quad 
Mode, which divides the screen into quarters and shows you quarter-
screen sized video feeds from four different cameras.
If it’s baseball-related, it’s in this app. There are stats galore, team 
standings, video highlights, text summaries (as shown in the figure 
on the right), and another of my favorites, the condensed game video 
that appears shortly after the end of many (if not most) games.
Chapter 14: Sports 

169
The video quality ranges from not bad to extremely pixilated and 
fuzzy. And although it’s usually better over Wi-Fi than 3G, sometimes 
it’s inexplicably worse over Wi-Fi. I have never really figured out why 
some video is better than other video. Sometimes 3G video looks 
pretty good; other times, it looks horrible. Video over Wi-Fi is no 
better (or worse).
Another thing I have to mention is that some postseason games were 
not available in At Bat 2009. On the other hand, the World Series was 
available, and being able to follow the game no matter where I hap-
pened to be was awesome.
Best features
At Bat is chock-full of features aimed squarely at baseball fans and at 
$9.99 for the entire 2009 season, it was a bargain.
Worst features
Video quality is unpredictable and some games are unavailable or 
blacked out in certain areas.

Sportacular Pro
 
$1.99 US
You know, I hear some people gamble on sporting events and games. 
I wouldn’t know anything about that, but Sportacular Pro is a sporting 
scores app that also aims to please those who may be interested in 
that other aspect of sports. Don’t get me wrong — this isn’t some kind 
of betting app. Sportacular Pro lets you pick winners and see what 
other users have picked for that game, complete with a demographic 
breakdown across the U.S. In addition, the app gives you the current 
odds on a game.
First, take a look at the fundamentals of this app. You can get scores 
for the NFL, MLB, the NBA, the NHL, MLS, NCAA football, NCAA bas-
ketball (men and women), soccer/football, and golf (PGA, LPGA, PGA 
Championships, EURO PGA, and PGA Nationwide). Scores include both 
current game and past scores for leagues, and you can get upcoming 
schedules, as well. For instance, with the NFL, the game defaults to 
pulling up the current week (when in season), and you can tap through 
past weeks for past scores or future weeks for those schedules.
To change sports, tap the button at the top left of the screen with the 
sporting icon (like a football if you’re in the NFL), and you get a list of 
all the offered sports. Tap a new sport, and you go to the Scores tab 
for that sport. It’s on the Scores tab, by the way, where you can get 
odds for upcoming games. This isn’t turned on by default, so you can 
either shake your iPhone when in this tab, or tap the button in the top 
right of the screen. If the game has already been played, you’ll see the 
score, as you can see in the figure on the left. If the game is still to be 
played, you get the point spread, as well as the over/under (o/u) for 
the game, also in that figure. If betting isn’t your thing, just leave this 
off and you won’t be confronted by it.
Now, tap one of those games, and you get a little more information 
on the game, including the date and time (if it’s yet to be played, the 
teams’ win/loss records, their position in whatever league or sub-
league they’re in, and the current betting line (regardless of whether 
the odds are turned on). You are also given the option of picking a 
winner, and after you make your pick, you see what other users have 
picked. Looking at an NBA game between the Celtics and the Heat, I just 
happened to go with other Sportacular users by (randomly) picking the 
Celtics, as you can see in the figure on the right. If I tap the View Map 
button, I get a regional breakdown of picks, where I can drill down further 
and get a breakdown by individual state. That’s pretty cool, if you’re into 
that sort of thing.
Chapter 14: Sports 

171
I can also chat with other users about the game through Facebook 
Connect. In the figure on the right, note the Details button and the 
Chat button. The Chat feature is really more like posting and read-
ing comments than true chatting — all handled through Facebook 
Connect. I’ve noticed that a lot of this chat is really just team fans talk-
ing smack to each other, so make of it what you will.
The app also offers league standing, news, which opens up news arti-
cles from other sources, and you can get alerts. Note that alerts cost 
additional money. The Pro version of this app means that it comes 
without ads, but alerts are still extra, handled via in-app purchases.
The free version of this app is ad supported, and offers most of the 
features the Pro version offers.
Best features
The app is designed well, has a very good interface, and is feature-rich.
Worst features
I think they would be well-served by offering more sports, and there’s 
something about paying extra for alerts in an app I’ve already paid for 
that rubs me the wrong way, but then you don’t have to subscribe to 
alerts in the first place.

CBS Sports Mobile
 
Free (ad supported)
CBS Sports Mobile offers you scores, news, team information, schedules, 
and videos from CBS Sports. Sports covered include the NFL, NCAA foot-
ball and men’s basketball (no coverage of the NCAA women’s programs), 
the NBA, the NHL, MLB, golf, racing, and tennis. I honestly liked this app 
less than the Fox Sports Mobile app — its interface is clunky and slow, 
and navigation isn’t thought out very well. What it has going for it are 
colorful graphics, video clips from CBS’s extensive coverage, and access 
to current college polls. Sporting apps are one of those subjective things, 
and because this is one of the most popular apps on iTunes, I thought it 
warranted mentioning.
 
Fantasy Football Cheatsheet ’09
 
$1.99 US
Fantasy sporting leagues are a big deal these days, with football and 
baseball probably being the most popular. Fantasy Football Cheatsheet 
’09 is an app that many fantasy footballers will find very useful for draft-
ing their teams and seeing recent stats and results for their players. You 
can put together multiple draft pick lists, and the app includes some 500 
ranked players and 900 total players. It has “up-to-the-minute” player 
news and injury reports, and includes past and present stats where 
applicable. Each new season gets a new app, so shop accordingly.
 
GolfLogix Golf GPS
 
Free limited download
 
(Requires in-app purchase of $39.95/year after 24 hours)
Golf GPS devices basically combine a GPS with golf course informa-
tion to tell you distance information on every hole of the covered 
golf course. GolfLogix Golf GPS turns your iPhone into such a device, 
giving you detailed course information on 24,000 golf courses around 
the world (!) right on your iPhone. With this app, you get distances to 

173
 Chapter 14: Sports
layups, hazards, as well as the front, center, and back of every green. 
You can also use it to keep score, and it even lets you enter in the 
specific clubs you’re using on that day’s golfing adventure. The app 
is a free download, but it requires a $39.95 per year membership after 
the first 24 hours.
 
PocketDyno+
 
$12.99
Don’t try this on the street, kids, but PocketDyno+ is like having a full-
blown dynamometer in your pocket. Using the iPhone’s accelerometer 
to measure drag racing performance of your vehicle, it can measure 
real-time Gs, speed, and distance, 0 to 60 MPH (or 100km/h) time, 
estimated wheel horsepower, reaction time with a simulated drag tree, 
60-, 330-, and 1,000-foot times, 1⁄4-mile and 1⁄8-mile times, and trap speed. 
It also lets you have multiple vehicle profiles so you can measure and 
store data for all your cars.
I can’t swear for the accuracy but in my limited (track-only) testing, it 
seemed to do a credible job for a thirteen-dollar app.
 Ski a nd Snow Report 
 
from SkiReport.com
 
Free
If you’ve ever lived with a skier or snowboarder, you know that they 
can be obsessive about checking the ski and snow reports for whatever 
ski resort happens to be close. This app, provided by SkiReport.com, 
facilitates that obsession by offering quick reports that are frequently 
updated. It uses your iPhone’s GPS to find resorts near you, give you 
their status in a list, including the snow base for open resorts, and 
new snow. Tap through and get details like what kind of snow is on the 
ground, first-hand reports, and how many lifts and trails are open. If you 
ski or snowboard, you want this app.

and Weather
 
FlightTrack Pro
 
 
$9.99 US
This app brings out the geek in me, and I 
bet it will do the same thing for you. As the 
name suggests, its main purpose is to track 
flights, in real time, with updated statuses, 
or even on a map. How cool is that? In addi-
tion, it pushes alerts out to you for changes 
in flight information and remembers the 
flights you’ve entered so you don’t have 
to re-enter them again. The app also offers 
integration with TripIt to automagically 
fetch your personal flight itineraries with-
out you having to enter a thing.
Start with the basic features: I’ve chosen a 
couple of random flights to monitor, and the 
app keeps them in a list for me until I delete 
them. For quick updates, all the basic information I need is right there. 
For instance, for the three flights I am currently monitoring, I see that all 
three are en route. I have flight numbers, departure and arrival times, 
and the departure and destination cities.
If I tap through to one of the flights — in this case, the Sacramento to 
O’Hare flight in the figure on the left — I’m taken to a screen that has 
gate numbers, terminals, times . . . Hey, what’s this? This flight is going 
to be early? That little warning popped up just in the nick of time for 
me to get a nice screenshot of it. You can see the flight information 
behind the warning pop-up, but it’s the warning that’s probably the 
most important thing here. Getting that information pushed to my 
phone when I’m supposed to pick someone up is a heck of a lot easier 
than calling the airline or even looking it up on the Web.
 
The status area in the upper-right corner of this screen rotates 
through flight status, elevation, and speed. As you all know by now, 
I’m an information junkie, and I enjoy seeing that sort of data, even if it 
doesn’t help me all that much.

Now, if I want to really geek out, I can tap the Map button at the top 
of the screen. On that screen, you see a map of the flight path, with 
the flight path itself drawn in red, as you can see in the figure on the 
right. You can see where the airplane is, too, along with weather radar 
so you can know if your loved ones are going to be flying through any 
kind of serious weather. How cool is that?
Other features include the capability to e-mail flight info directly from 
the app. The e-mails have the latest flight status (including updated 
arrival times) and a still from the same map I have below! Alternatively, I 
could tweet the current flight status through the built-in Twitter support. 
Lastly, I can see the full itinerary for a flight by tapping it, which takes 
me to that itinerary in Safari.
This is a very slick app with sophisticated flight-tracking capabilities. 
If you fly a lot, or if you have colleagues or loved ones who fly a lot, 
you’ll want this app. If $9.99 is more than you want to pay, for $4.99, 
you can get the regular version of FlightTrack without the push alerts, 
airport delay notifications, or support for TripIt.
Best features
The push alerts for any kind of flight status change are really helpful, 
especially with so many late flights these days.
Worst features
You can’t see more than one flight at a time on the Map tool, but that’s 
not likely to be something that you need to do very often, anyway.

M obileNavigator North America
 
$89.99 US
Of the half-dozen or so GPS apps I’ve tested, the one I prefer is 
MobileNavigator by Navigon. Granted, I don’t think any of the iPhone 
GPS apps I tested is as good as the GPS system built in to our Acura 
MDX, but then again, none of the iPhone apps sells for more than $99. 
And although I can’t remember the exact cost of the Acura system, 
I’m sure it was quite a bit more than $1,000. I also have a Magellan 
RoadMate pocket-sized GPS that sells for around $100, and I think the 
MobileNavigator is just as good and possibly better. Plus, I can’t help 
thinking that the RoadMate, which hangs off of the inside of the wind-
shield, is a temptation for thieves to break into my car and steal it. 
Because the iPhone leaves the car when I do, theft is not an issue with 
an iPhone-based GPS.
One of the things I like best (and that some people hate most) is that 
unlike some apps, this app doesn’t choke when you don’t have an 
EDGE or 3G network signal. Some of the other apps just stop working 
until you obtain a cellular connection again. As a result of this, the app 
is huge — 1.5GB — but that’s a trade-off I’m willing to make to avoid 
having my GPS die if I’m in a dead zone.
I find MobileNavigator’s user interface a model of efficiency. I had 
trouble figuring out how to access some of the functions in other GPS 
apps, but this one makes everything easy to find and use. Because 
I hate to type on my iPhone keyboard, I love the intelligent address 
entry system, as shown in the figure on the left. It guesses state, city, 
and street names as I type them, saving me innumerable keystrokes. I 
also like the one-tap access to my iPhone contacts, which also saves 
me taps and keystrokes.
Some iPhone GPS apps don’t pronounce street names. MobileNavigator 
does, and it does a pretty good job with most of them, even the tricky 
ones.
Perhaps my favorite thing about MobileNavigator is its 3-D Reality View, 
shown in the figure on the right. It’s pleasing to the eye and easy to deci-
pher. As you can see, I’m half a mile from an interchange and the screen 
display makes it really easy for me to determine which lane I need to 
be in. The map automatically switches between day and night, getting 
brighter by day and dimmer by night. Nice!

Chapter 15: Travel, Navigation, and Weather 

177
Other useful features include support for landscape and portrait 
mode, route planning, and optional real-time traffic reporting, known 
as Traffic Live, which costs an additional $25. I’ve only had my 
MobileNavigator for a few days, but so far I think it was a bargain — 
even though it doesn’t always report traffic as accurately as I’d like.
I also like to be able to listen to and control music without leaving 
MobileNavigator. MobileNavigator automatically resumes navigation 
after an incoming phone call, another nice touch.
Because $89.99 is a lot to pay for an app, I’d be remiss if I didn’t at 
least mention a much less expensive option that’s also quite good. 
It’s called MotionX-GPS Drive, available with 30 days of Live Voice 
Guidance for just $2.99. You can purchase additional 30-day Live Voice 
Guidance packages whenever you need them for another $2.99.
Best features
MobileNavigator doesn’t need an EDGE or 3G network connection 
to function, has a great user interface and terrific 3-D maps, and 
announces street names.
Worst features
It’s not cheap. If you also purchase the optional $25 Traffic Live pack-
age, it’s the most expensive GPS app in the iTunes Store today.

Priceline Hotel Negotiator
 
Free
Discounted hotels and a video of William Shatner busting his way 
through a plywood wall? Sign me up! Seriously, what more could an 
iPhone owner want in an app?
Priceline Hotel Negotiator is a dedicated app for finding hotel-only 
deals through Priceline’s online service. Priceline (www.priceline.
com) is a discount online travel service that first made its mark by 
allowing you to name your own price for hotels with a specific star 
rating in a given area, and then matching that price with a hotel that 
accepts it. The upside is that you can get some killer hotel deals this 
way. The tradeoff is that you don’t know which hotel you’ll end up 
with, and if you bid too low, you won’t be able to make another bid for 
that star rating and area until the next day.
After that initial approach helped set the site apart, Priceline eventu-
ally added airlines, car rentals, cruises, and other forms of travel-
related services, and then it eventually also allowed you to browse for 
set discounted rates for those services.
Hotel Negotiator is, therefore, a subset of what Priceline as a whole 
offers, and it’s being marketed with an extensive campaign fronted by 
spokesperson William Shatner (you know, Star Trek’s original Captain 
Kirk). That’s why his picture is on the app’s icon, and why he’s kicking 
things off by busting through that wall. This app allows you to use the 
Hotel Negotiator service on your iPhone, and the company has done a 
pretty good job of making an iPhone app that is easy to use.
To start the process, choose the city you’re looking to book a room 
in. I chose Austin because I have some family flying in for the holi-
days, and I thought it would be cool to kill two birds with one stone. 
I hope you don’t mind. After you choose your city, you’re taken to 
the Negotiator tab, where you can see recent winning bids for hotels 
at various star rating levels in all the different neighborhoods in the 
city, as you can see in the figure on the left. You can see the number of 
stars, the percentage saved in the winning bid, and the specific price.
If you tap one of these items, you’re taken to a new screen with dates 
and a slider that represents how much you’re willing to bid. Set your 
price, tap the Bid Now button — I decided to go aggressive with my 
bid, as you can see in the figure on the right — and you’re taken to a 
new screen that has all the real details and more information about 
how the bidding process works. The key to Priceline’s bidding system 
Chapter 15: Travel, Navigation, and Weather 

179
is that you have to pay up front — if your bid is accepted, you are 
automatically booked (and paid) in the hotel that did the accepting. 
It’s part of why hotels are willing to participate with Priceline on these 
discounts.
In any event, if you can handle a little risk in finding a hotel room, 
you aren’t likely to find better deals than through Priceline Hotel 
Negotiator, at least not in my experience.
This app also lets you browse hotels and see their published prices. 
These are usually the same prices that all the online travel agencies 
offer, for what it’s worth. To see prices this way, tap the Browse tab 
after you’ve chosen a city. There you can find a list of popular, mostly 
nice hotels. You can filter the list by popularity, star rating, or neigh-
borhood, but I wish I could search, too.
Best features
The app is easy to use, and if you can accept some risk in booking 
your hotel, it’s a great way to find a deal.
Worst features
Hotels should be searchable in Browse mode, but they’re not.

Travel Assistant Pro
 
$4. 99 US
I’m not the most organized of travelers, so I’ve really enjoyed seeing 
all the travel-related apps that have come out for the iPhone. Travel 
Assistant Pro seems like it was made just for me. With this app, I can 
keep all my itinerary information in my iPhone, and with its built-in 
support for TripIt and TripIt Pro Web-based travel organizers, I can 
get that information instantly updated by simply shaking my iPhone. 
It’s just what I need!
The first thing to understand about Travel Assistant Pro is that it’s a 
great app even if you don’t have a TripIt account. You can enter com-
plete itineraries (see figure on the left), including flights, trains, cruise 
information, or other stuff for, say, driving in a car or maybe taking 
a bus. You can also add taxi or car service plans, car rental reserva-
tions, hotel, and other accommodation information, with an Other 
Event category for something that falls outside those parameters. You 
can add notes for your trip, and then add contacts for the trip under 
two sub-tabs, Trip People and Event People.
After I’ve added all this information, for example, I can e-mail it out 
directly from the app so that all those things I normally lose track of 
are with my wife. She likes that.
That’s not all, though. Travel Assistant Pro lets me enter my rewards 
programs broken down by airline, hotel, train, cruise, or car rental, 
with an Other Travel category, just in case. Better yet, after I enter 
these the first time, Travel Assistant Pro remembers the information 
for future trips. That is so what I need! The app also has a Travel Log 
feature for notes and lists for me to make for packing or shopping or 
whatever — see the sample list in the figure on the right.
 
Many screens with important information (rewards program entries, 
addresses, flight information, and so on) allow you to rotate your 
iPhone to have that info presented full screen with large letters. It’s 
great for when you need to give your numbers to someone else.
Now, that’s all fantastic. It’s everything I needed to keep my basic 
travel information organized and handy. With TripIt or TripIt Pro inte-
gration, however, the app becomes even more convenient. With a free 
TripIt account, you can e-mail any ol’ itinerary you’ve received from 
Chapter 15: Travel, Navigation, and Weather 

181
a travel agency, airline, hotel, car rental service, and so on, to your 
TripIt account, and it’s available in its entirety on Travel Assistant Pro 
without you having to enter anything at all.
If something about that itinerary is updated (say your flight is 
delayed), TripIt lets you know through the app, too. All you have to 
do is shake your iPhone to sync it with TripIt for the latest informa-
tion. TripIt is free, whereas TripIt Pro is $69.95 per year. With the 
Pro version, you also get updated information for such things as gate 
numbers and baggage claim carousels. You don’t need TripIt to use 
this fantastic app, but if you like the service, the support is a great 
convenience.
Best features
Being able to get status and other itinerary updates with just a shake 
of your iPhone (with TripIt) is an awesome feature, and having all my 
travel-related information with me in one source is so convenient that 
even I can’t lose it.
Worst features
I haven’t been able to figure out how to get Travel Assistant Pro to get 
my baggage from baggage claim, but I’m ever-hopeful.

WeatherBug/WeatherBug Elite
 
$1.99 US
Here’s sort of a dirty little secret, so don’t tell anyone: I bet I check 
the outside temperature on my iPhone more than I do anything else. 
It’s true. If I want to know how to dress, I’ve found that the iPhone is 
hands-down the fastest way to get outside weather conditions. Your 
iPhone comes with a handy little app called Weather for getting cur-
rent conditions and a multiday forecast, but real weather bugs are 
going to want to check out WeatherBug Elite, a wonderful app for get-
ting the temperature, conditions, forecast (seven day and hourly!), 
alerts from the National Weather Service, access to live weather cams, 
cached information for viewing offline, satellite and radar maps . . . the 
list goes on. I tell you, this is a great weather app.
Check out the figure on the left. It’s my home town of Austin, Texas, 
where it’s 48 degrees as I’m writing this. This is the main page for 
checking out the conditions for cities for which weather conditions 
are compiled and made available to the public. In addition to tempera-
ture, I can get the current conditions, wind direction, wind chill, dew 
point, and humidity. At the bottom of the screen is today’s forecast.
To see a seven-day forecast, tap the arrow in the lower-right corner 
of the screen in the panel with today’s forecast. Each day is presented 
as a forecast for the daytime and additional forecasts for the evening 
and night. You can drill down still further by tapping either panel for 
the hourly forecast (from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.) for that day. You can also 
get the seven-day forecast by tapping the Forecast tab in the main 
navigation bar.
You can watch multiple cities, too. In the Home button at the top of 
the screen, you can add whatever cities you want and then swipe 
through them in the other views. The app defaults to your current 
location if you allow the app to use Location Services on your iPhone. 
WeatherBug Elite offers both U.S. and international locations, although 
not all of the services are available outside the U.S.
Next to the Forecast tab is the Maps tab, which you can see in the fig-
ures. The app uses Doppler Radar, satellite imagery, and other views, 
which are pulled through Microsoft Visual Earth, so you can see exactly 
what’s happening and where. At the top of the screen, you find buttons 
for setting preferences, including which view you want to see, what kind 
of conditions, and so on. I wish I could show you a dozen screenshots 
for this app because a lot of these map views are gorgeous. You really 
need to see them to understand everything this app can show you.
Chapter 15: Travel, Navigation, and Weather 

183
Other features of WeatherBug Elite include a daily weather video from 
the WeatherBug Web site (www.weatherbug.com) that offers a fore-
cast and weather recap from a weather person. You can find that in 
the Video tab. It’s a national look at U.S. weather, so it’s no substitute 
for your local TV station’s weather segment, but you can pull it up on 
demand, which is handy.
The last tab in this app is the Camera tab, where you can look at the 
view from weather cameras installed in your watched cities. Just 
swipe through the current image to move to another live camera view. 
Note that the last several images from each camera are included, and 
you can animate them by tapping the Animation button at the top of 
the screen.
A free version of the app called WeatherBug is available. It’s ad sup-
ported and doesn’t have some features of the Elite app, but it still 
packs a punch in the weather department.
Best features
This app offers comprehensive weather coverage at your fingertips. 
It’s like having a meteorologist in your pocket!
Worst features
Some international cities listed in the app don’t actually have weather 
stations.

Google Earth
 
Free
The Google Earth app for iPhone offers users the same amazing satel-
lite views of (most of) the planet as the company’s desktop Google 
Earth map, and I think that’s just amazing. Covering “half the world’s 
population” and “a third of the earth’s land mass,” Google Earth for 
iPhone lets you spin a globe to pick a spot, and then drill all the way 
down to a street-view of that location. It’s too cool, and you need to 
try it to believe it. The globe spins, you can turn on access to geo-
located Wikipedia articles, and even see geo-located photographs 
from around the world if you turn on the Panoramio feature.
 
MapQuest 4 Mobile
 
Free
Remember MapQuest? It’s what you used for online directions before 
Google Maps came along. Ah, I kid MapQuest, I kid! The company has 
made a great iPhone app that is especially good at finding local busi-
nesses. When you view a map, you see a row of buttons for turning 
on displays of hotels, restaurants, retail stores, gas stations, coffee 
shops, and post offices. Just tap each button and get a quick overlay 
of that category of locations on your map. Tap the location and get 
more information on or directions to that business. It’s pretty darned 
slick, intuitive, and useful. You can also get turn-by-turn directions, of 
course, and save locations to My Places.
 NOAA National Weather Service
 
$1.99 US
If you like your weather a little dryer (pun intended) than WeatherBug 
Elite, NOAA National Weather Service may be the weather app for 
you. It pulls its data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) and the National Weather Service, and pres-
ents it pretty much as-is. You can get local conditions, forecast, a map 
view, and radar information, all in a fairly no-nonsense fashion. In 
addition to the local-condition information, this app also has marine 
conditions and forecast, including a high-seas forecast. This isn’t the 
prettiest weather app out there, but the information it offers is com-
plete and comprehensive.

Postman
 
$2.99 US
You know, when you travel, you really should send a postcard to your 
loved ones to show them you miss them, or at least what they’re miss-
ing! The Postman app for iPhone allows you to do this with photos you 
take on your iPhone (there’s a library of images, too), and then per-
sonalize it just like a postcard. Customize a message, customize the 
font, or wrap your image with one of several very professional-looking 
themes. You can write something to your friends on the “back” of the 
card, and then send it to people via Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, Tumblr, 
or by posting it on the Web. It’s super-easy to use and a lot of fun.
 
TideApp 
 
Free (ad supported)
If you sail, surf, fish, or swim (or whatever) near coastal waters, check 
out TideApp for current tide information. The app brings this infor-
mation from all over the world and includes current conditions and 
the forecast for both low and high tides during the day. It includes 
sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset information, too. You can 
add specific locations to a Favorites tab for quick viewing later, and 
each location also offers a chart view — you can swipe through these 
charts for past and future days. Hundreds of locations around the U.S. 
are offered, and what seems like all the major ports around the world, 
so have fun!

A ir Mouse Pro
 
 
$ 5.99 US
Air Mouse Pro (also known as Mobile Air 
Mouse) is a versatile app that can magi-
cally transform your iPhone into a wireless 
remote control system for your Mac or PC. 
With it, you can control your computer 
from across the room or even from another 
room (although that can be difficult if you 
can’t see your computer display). The 
point is that the remote works from any-
where in your home or office that has Wi-Fi 
reception.
After you install the free Air Mouse Server 
software on your Mac or PC, you can con-
trol the mouse cursor on your computer 
screen two different ways: by accelerometer or by trackpad. In accel-
erometer mode, you press the yellow trigger shown near the top of 
the figure on the left and then wave your iPhone around in the air. The 
mouse cursor on your computer screen moves more or less in tandem 
with your hand. Alas, I found accelerometer mode made it quite dif-
ficult to control the cursor accurately; although when it works, this 
method makes an awesome iPhone demo. I found trackpad mode, in 
which the top half of your iPhone screen acts like the trackpad on a 
laptop, much easier to use. 
In either mode, you can enlarge the trackpad area by shaking the 
iPhone from side to side. You can tap the lower-left part of the track-
pad to emulate a left mouse button click and the lower-right part to 
perform a right-click. Rotate your iPhone a quarter turn to use it in 
landscape mode, which makes it easier to type because the keys on 
the alphanumeric keyboard (not shown) are bigger.
In addition to the trackpad modes, Air Mouse Pro includes four key-
board layouts. The first layout is the standard iPhone alphanumeric 
keyboard. The other layouts are a media keyboard with buttons for

play, pause, next/fast forward, previous/rewind, and so on; a Web 
keyboard (shown below on the left); and a programmable remote key-
board with function and arrow keys (shown below on the right). 
The coolest thing about Air Mouse Pro is that you can program the 
buttons on the media and Web keyboards to do what you want for 
the programs you like. For example, you can program the buttons to 
work in iTunes, PowerPoint, and DVD Player. Air Mouse Pro automati-
cally detects which program you are using and switches to the button 
assignments you set for that program. 
Using Air Mouse Pro takes a bit of practice. If you’re willing to give it a 
bit of your time, however, you’ll be rewarded by being able to control 
your computer from across the room with Air Mouse Pro, almost as 
well as you control it using your usual mouse and keyboard.
Best features 
Air Mouse Pro turns your iPhone into a totally programmable remote 
control for your Mac or PC!
Worst features 
You have to practice Air Mouse Pro to use it effectively. It also occa-
sionally lags or loses contact with your Mac or PC.

Ap pBox Pro
 
$0.99 US
AppBox Pro combines 18 useful apps in one inexpensive package. I was 
going to say it is the Swiss Army Knife of iPhone apps, but it’s more like 
a Swiss Army Arsenal. The 18 apps (which I’m going to call modules to 
avoid confusion) are Battery Life, Clinometer (with surface/bubble level), 
Currency Converter (with 195 currencies), Date Calculator, Days Until 
(also known as Countdown), Flashlight, Holidays (for 83 countries), Loan 
Calculator, Periodic Calculator, Price Grab, Random Number Generator, 
Ruler, Sale Price Calculator, System Info, Tip Calculator, Translator, and 
Unit Converter, plus direct links to Web apps. You can see the icons for 
all these modules in the figure on the left. 
Two things in particular make this app a winner in my opinion. The 
first is that after I installed AppBox Pro, I was able to delete nine or ten 
individual apps from my iPhone. Although it’s true that many of the 
apps AppBox Pro replaced were freebies, it also means I have room 
for nine or ten other apps on my iPhone. 
The second great thing about AppBox Pro is the quality of the modules, 
which is mostly outstanding. I didn’t expect these modules to be as good 
as or better than stand-alone apps I’ve seen, but most of them are. For 
example, there are dozens of flashlight apps that are free or only cost a 
buck or two. The Flashlight module in AppBox Pro is at least as functional 
as the best of them. Although the AppBox Pro Unit Converter module 
isn’t as pretty or easy to use as some of the other conversion apps you 
can get (such as the excellent ConvertBot I raved about in Chapter 2), it 
has pretty much the same functionality, right down to being able to dis-
play only the units I need (such as acres and square feet) and hide units I 
don’t care about (such as hides, roods, rods, and poles). 
Some of the AppBox Pro modules aren’t particularly beautiful, but all 
are usable, and they all do what they are supposed to do quite nicely. 
Check out the Unit Converter shown in the figure on the right. The 
AppBox Pro Unit Converter module offers pretty much the exact same 
functionality as the prettier ConvertBot, and for the price, you get a 
bunch of other modules, too. On the other hand, some of the other 
modules, such as Clinometer and Battery Life, are almost as hand-
some as any of the stand-alone apps.

Chapter 16: Utilities

AppBox Pro includes a couple of modules I never would have consid-
ered had they been stand-alone apps, even if they were free, such as 
Loan Calculator and Price Grab. But I found the Loan Calculator, with 
its A/B comparison mode, quite useful when I was shopping for a car 
not too long ago. I’m not very math-savvy, so I love the Price Grab 
module, which lets me compare the prices of any two items and then 
tells me the cost per unit (ounce, pound, gallon, and so on) for each. I 
never would have thought to look for an app like Price Grab, but now I 
use it all the time. 
Best features 
How can you not love 18 mostly useful app modules for less than a 
buck? Sure, you won’t use them all, but even if you only use a handful, 
AppBox Pro is a bargain. 
Worst features 
It doesn’t work at all in landscape mode, which means that some Web 
apps don’t work properly (if at all). And the procedure for adding new 
Web apps could be easier and more intuitive.

GottaGo
 
$1.99 US
Imagine that you’re attending the most boring meeting ever. You know 
that suddenly remembering you need to be somewhere else will look 
suspicious. But you wish you had a credible excuse to leave.
The solution is the GottaGo app, which may turn out to be the best 
two-dollar app you ever bought. Just set its timer, and at the appropri-
ate moment, GottaGo makes it appear that you’re receiving a phone 
call, SMS text message, or MMS multimedia message that looks thor-
oughly realistic but is actually a fake. This app can definitely get you 
out of any situation, assuming you don’t crack up laughing as I did the 
first time I tried it.
Start by configuring your Call, SMS, or MMS Settings. The Call Settings 
screen is shown in the figure on the left; the SMS and MMS Settings 
screens are pretty much the same. As you can see, I’ve set up my fake 
calls to look like they’re from my wife Lisa. I used the picture and ring-
tone I’d see and hear if she were calling me for real, and I selected the 
wallpaper I’m currently using on my phone to make the fake incoming 
call look realistic. As you can see in the image on the right, the simu-
lated phone call looks perfect. The Decline and Answer buttons work 
like the real things, so if you tap the Answer button the translucent 
in-call button overlay (Mute, Keypad, Speaker, Add Call, Contacts, and 
Hold) appears, and it looks perfectly realistic as well. 
To make the situation even more realistic, you can record audio that 
plays when you answer your fake call. I recorded my wife saying, 
“Honey, I’ve fallen and I can’t get up,” but I couldn’t keep a straight 
face when I heard it. Now her recording says, “Honey, I’m afraid we 
had a little incident here at the house.” She then pauses long enough 
for me to say, “OK, do you need me to come home now?” She replies, 
“Yes, please. And please hurry.” If anyone is standing near me they 
can hear enough of her voice to believe it’s really her calling. If I want 
to enhance the effect, I can tap the Speaker button and everyone in the 
area can hear her.
GottaGo includes a setting for what is displayed on the screen until 
the time your fake call or message is due to arrive. One option is a 
black screen, which makes it look like your iPhone is asleep. If you 
Chapter 16: Utilities 

191
choose the Slide to Unlock screen instead — which looks totally real-
istic, just like everything else in GottaGo — you can make the fake call 
or message appear before the appointed time by unlocking the phone. 
As soon as you do your fake incoming call or message appears on the 
screen.
After you set up the Settings screen(s), you merely set the timer for 
between five seconds and 60 minutes, tap the Gotta Go! button, and 
you’re ready to get out of whatever hateful task awaits you.
GottaGo is simple to set up and looks totally realistic. If you don’t 
mind being a little deceitful, you can extract yourself gracefully from 
almost any situation as long as you don’t laugh or get caught. 
Best features 
Everything about GottaGo is so realistic that even the most eagle-eyed 
iPhone enthusiast won’t be able to tell you’re faking it.
Worst features 
The battery display doesn’t appear in green as it should on my iPhone 
3GS, and it always appears half-full (or half-empty if you’re a pessimist).

Nig ht Stand
 
$0.99 US
Simply put, Night Stand is the most attractive and full-featured alarm 
clock app I’ve seen (and I’ve seen quite a few). I know some of you are 
thinking, “But the iPhone comes with a Clock app that has a built-in 
alarm clock, so why would I want to spend even a buck on Night Stand?”
I’m glad you asked. Okay, I know you didn’t actually ask, but I’m going 
to tell you anyway. Night Stand is better in almost every way and 
much better looking than the Clock app’s alarm clock.
Let’s start with beauty. I find it relaxing to look at the Metanoi theme, 
which is shown in the figure on the left. The glow pulsates subtly and 
the second hand (the little purple dot at 3 o’clock) sweeps smoothly 
around and around. Compare that to the built-in alarm clock app, 
which doesn’t even include a visual clockface. Night Stand, on the 
other hand, has a lovely visual clock (see the figure on the right) and 
lets you choose from five other attractive themes designed by Piotr 
Gajos, who is an Apple Design Award winner.
Beauty is skin deep, though, and I wouldn’t recommend this (or any 
other app) just because it’s pretty. I recommend Night Stand because 
it’s pretty and — in addition to having almost every feature the built-
in alarm clock has — Night Stand has some terrific features the built-in 
alarm clock doesn’t have. 
Take screen dimming, for example. The built-in alarm clock doesn’t have 
anything like it. As I said, it doesn’t even have a clock face. Night Stand 
has a really nice dimming feature that’s easy to activate or deactivate 
even when you’re half asleep. To dim the clock, you double-tap the 
screen; to brighten it, you tap once again.
Another nice feature is that you can listen to music from your iPod 
while you fall asleep at night. Just specify how long you want the 
music to play before Night Stand fades it out. I happen to like falling 
asleep with music playing, but I don’t like it to play all night. So I think 
this is an especially sweet feature.
You can adjust the Night Stand snooze setting to let you sleep for 5, 
10, 15, or 30 additional minutes. The iPhone’s built-in alarm clock has 
only one default snooze setting, which I think is five minutes.
There’s a clever option called Math Puzzles, which forces you to solve 
a simple math problem — such as “How much is (20 * 8) – 20; choose 
Chapter 16: Utilities 

193
either 140 or 143” — when you tap the Turn Off button. Night Stand 
continues to sound the alarm until you tap the correct answer.
If you travel much or work with an office in another time zone, you’ll 
love Night Stand’s dual time zone support. One of the themes displays 
two clocks on screen at once; the other five themes let you swipe a 
finger across the screen to switch time zones.
Unlike the built-in alarm clock, Night Stand is rotation-aware, so when 
you turn your iPhone sideways the clock display turns sideways, too. 
The clock even becomes a little bit larger when in landscape mode.
I saved the best feature for last. The built-in alarm clock can only wake 
you up to one of your ringtone sounds; with Night Stand, you can pick 
any song or songs, playlist, or album on your iPod. I’d probably pay a 
buck for that feature alone.
Best features 
Night Stand has too many good features to mention, and many that 
you won’t find in the iPhone’s built-in alarm clock.
Worst features 
The one thing the built-in alarm clock can do that Night Stand can’t is quit 
the app and still have the alarm go off. It’s disappointing that the alarm 
won’t go off after I quit Night Stand, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me.

Perfect Web Browser
 
$3.99 US
The m ore time you spend surfing the Web, the more you’ll like this 
nifty app. The humbly named Perfect Web Browser is an alternative 
Web browser that does almost everything Safari can do and does 
almost all of those things faster than Safari. The number one reason to 
love Perfect Web Browser, though, is that it offers oodles of features 
you won’t find in Safari.
For example, Perfect Web Browse r has tabbed browsing, as shown in the 
figure on the left. Two-and-a-half tabs are visible in the figure, but you can 
create as many tabs as you want. To see a tab that is not currently visible, 
flick the tab bar to the left or right. To hide the tab bar, tap the little blue 
triangle below the tab bar’s lower-left corner.
Perfect Web Browser loads and renders tabs in the background, so 
while you’re reading one page you can have half a dozen (or more) 
additional pages loading in the background. That means there’s no 
waiting for those pages to load — tap a tab, and that page is already 
rendered and ready to read.
Furthermore, if you enable the Restore Last Session option, Perfect 
Web Browser remembers what tabs you have open so that they 
reopen the next time you launch the app.
Another great option is Web Compression. If you enable this option, 
most Web pages you visit will appear on screen noticeably faster. 
Actually, Perfect Web Browser feels faster than Safari, even with Web 
Compression turned off. Plus, it uses an advanced caching scheme so 
that subsequent visits to pages load as much as 40% faster. 
One of my favorite features is that I can hide and show the address bar at 
the top of the screen, the toolbar at the bottom of the screen, and — as 
I mentioned before — the tab bar, each with a single tap. I can also hide 
them all at once with a single tap and have a completely unobstructed 
full-screen view, as you can see in the figure on the right.
Notice how the word button is highlighted in yellow in the figure on the 
right? I’m showing off another cool feature of Perfect Web Browser — 
the capability to search for text within a Web page.
Also visible on the right side of the screen shown in the figure on the 
right is a gray bar with blue arrows at each end. This feature is called 
Hyper Scroll, which overlays a real scroll bar on the right side of the 
Chapter 16: Utilities 

195
page. Just press the red line (near the top in the figure on the right) 
and drag it to scroll up or down. With Hyper Scroll you can get to the 
top, bottom, or any place in between quickly and easily.
Other superlative features include an option to clear all cookies when 
you quit the app, a private browsing mode (meaning no history is 
created for the pages you visit), a rotation lock to prevent accidental 
page rotation, and the capability to send a page from Safari to Perfect 
Web Browser, where it opens in the full-page view.
That last feature is especially welcome because although Perfect Web 
Browser includes bookmarks, it doesn’t import or display your book-
marks from Safari.
The bottom line is that I think Perfect Web Browser is so cool that I 
removed the Safari icon from my iPhone’s Dock and replaced it with 
Perfect Web Browser.
Best features 
Faster Web surfing and tabbed browsing are my favorite features, but 
full-screen browsing and in-page search are also awesome. 
Worst features 
Perfect Web Browser doesn’t import or display Safari bookmarks.

Email ’n Walk 
 
$0.99 US
Email ’n Walk lets you compose and send e-mail while you’re on the 
run (or walk) by using your iPhone’s camera to display what’s in front 
of you in a transparent message form. In other words, Email ’n Walk 
lets you see right through the message as you’re typing.
The app description says, “Note: We can’t take responsibility for your 
stupidity, so please don’t walk into traffic, off cliffs, or into the middle 
of gunfights while emailing.” That cracks me up.
I’d like it better if Email ’n Walk let me compose and send SMS messages, 
but it’s still a pretty cool way to multi-task, and it only costs a buck. 
 
Flashlight
 
Free
You won’t need Flashlight if you bought AppBox Pro (described earlier 
in this chapter) because a flashlight is one of its 18 tools. But if AppBox 
Pro isn’t your cup of tea, try Flashlight. It’s a flashlight app that offers 
every feature you could possibly want and then some. You can shine 
it in red, white, blue, or any other color you choose. You can use it to 
check that every pixel on your iPhone screen is working. You can even 
use it as a strobe light.
A flashlight is a handy app to have, and this one is full-featured and free.
  
iEmoticons — Emoji. Smiley, 
Emoticon Keyboard
 
$0.99 US
Some people have never embellished an e-mail, SMS, MMS, or chat 
message with tiny, colorful, images; other folks would include them in 
everything they type if they could. If you’re one of those in the second 
group, you’ll love iEmoticons — an app that gives you more than 400 
little pictures you can insert into anything you type on your iPhone.

197
 Chapter 16: Utilities
The little pictures, often called Emoji or Emoticons, include all the 
familiar yellow smiley faces, plus hearts, aliens, dining utensils, balls 
(football, soccer, baseball, and so on), animals, flowers, electronic 
devices, and many more. 
The Emoticons are a little dorky, but if you like dorky things, you can 
get a lot of them for only a buck. 
 
iHandy Carpenter
 
$1.99 US
If you do any type of carpentry work, or if you just like carpenter tools, 
iHandy Carpenter provides five useful carpenter tools — plum bob, 
surface level, bubble level, protractor, and ruler — in a single app. 
Just getting those tools makes this app worth having, but the tools 
are also among the most beautiful iPhone tools you can get. I don’t 
know that I’ll ever need them for carpentry purposes, but they were 
so pretty I bought them anyway. 
If you want to see just how nice-looking an app can be, try iHandy 
Level Free, which is the same bubble level tool found in iHandy 
Carpenter, but for free.
 
RedLaser
 
$1.99 US
Ever been in a store trying to figure out whether something would 
be less expensive if you bought it on the Internet? If so, you’re going 
to love RedLaser, which scans barcodes and gets you prices for the 
item using Google Product Search and Amazon.com. It’s surprisingly 
accurate and fairly quick. Although it wasn’t great at finding prices for 
inexpensive items such as food or beverages, it did great with higher-
ticket items such as electronic devices, power tools, and almost every-
thing that cost more than $25 at Home Depot.
It’s one of a very few apps that has actually saved me money.

17 My Ten Favorite Free Apps
 
Comics
 
 
Free
 If you read my review in Chapter 1, you can tell that 
I really love this app. My biggest gripe was that the 
app didn’t have enough comics from “the big guys 
(such as Marvel and DC Comics).” The app now has 
more than 150 titles from Marvel Comics, includ-
ing my all-time favorite, Spider-Man! Many of the 
titles are classics, including issue #1 of The Amazing 
Spider-Man. Released in 1963 for 12¢, a copy in excel-
lent condition goes for at least $25,000 US today! 
I also talk about Guided View in Chapter 1. The fig-
ures below show what that looks like on an iPhone 
screen. On the left is the entire front cover; on the 
right is the same artwork broken into two panels as they appear on 
your screen. The top panel on the right appears full screen, and then 
the “camera” pans slowly downward and to the right to reveal the 
bottom panel.
 The bottom line
If you like comics or graphic novels, you’re sure to enjoy this app.

C oncert Vault
 
Free
What I didn’t have room to say back in Chapter 9 is that the Concert 
Vault iPhone app is rockin’ awesome (pun intended). But a big part 
of what makes it so great is that it’s linked to a companion Web site 
called Wolfgang’s Concert Vault (www.wolfgangsvault.com).
The companion Web site is fantastic because it is easier to browse 
and search than the iPhone app, and it allows you to create an unlim-
ited number of playlis ts featuring songs from different concerts. The 
iPhone app lets you listen to these playlists but not create them. The 
figure on the left shows my Todd Rundgren/Utopia playlist, which fea-
tures tunes from half a dozen different concerts. One final point: the 
iPhone app lets you add concerts to your “favorites” list, but you can 
only delete them from the Web site!
On the flip side, the iPhone app is terrific because the user interface 
is clean and easy to navigate, as you can see in the figure on the right. 
The app works over WiFi, EDGE, and 3G networks, and the Wolfgang’s 
Concert Vault Web site is barely usable on the iPhone’s Web browser.
The bottom line
If you love classic rock music and want to hear exclusive live perfor-
mances, Concert Vault is just the ticket.

Eliminate Pro
 
Fr ee
Eliminate Pro, a first-person shooter game, offers two modes of play: 
offline practice games and multiplayer online games. Offline practice 
games, which pit you against computer-controlled (actually iPhone-
controlled) robots, are challenging and a lot of fun. They don’t deplete 
your energy, which is good. Unfortunately, they don’t earn you any 
credits, either, which is bad.
The multiplayer online games, on the other hand, let you compete against 
other living people in real time. These games earn you credits based on 
your performance, and you can use your credits to buy better weapons 
or armor or additional energy. Better gear helps you play better so you 
earn more credits per game. But you only get to play a few games before 
you run out of energy. At that point, you can either use some of your 
credits to buy more energy, wait a couple of hours for your free recharge, 
or purchase additional energy using real money (actually, iTunes Store 
credits). I’m cheap, so I wait for the free recharges, but if you’re willing to 
pay to play, it’ll cost you around a buck or two (US) per hour.
The bottom line
Playing hasn’t cost me a cent and I’m having a lot of fun. I still have 
mediocre weapons and armor, and I still pretty much stink, but even so, 
I dare you to eliminate me. My handle is levitus; come and get some. . . .
Good luck.

Google Mobile
 
Free
Let me tell you a couple of the reasons I love this app:
 
✓ Reason #1: Its speech-to-text engine is amazingly accurate. I’ve 
tried many speech-to-text systems over the years, including 
continuous voice recognition (dictation) software for PCs and 
Macs, such as Dragon NaturallySpeaking and MacSpeech, as well 
as iPhone apps that include ReQall and Qui ckVoice2Text Email. 
Google Mobile is as good as or better than all of them.
 
✓ Reason #2: If you meet someone who asks how your iPhone 
works, demonstrate it by pulling yours out, launching Google 
Mobile, and asking it to search for something on the Web. Then 
hand it to the person and watch their jaw drop when they see the 
search results on the screen. Not many apps work as well for an 
iPhone demo, and that’s priceless.
And one last thing: I recently discovered that you can tap the magnify-
ing glass on the left side of the Search field to narrow your search, as 
shown in the figure on the left (iPhone and Web is the default). When 
I selected Images and searched for the University of Texas tower 
at night, the results were even better than the figure on the left in 
Chapter 12, as you can see in the figure on the right below.
The bottom line
Sea rching the Web with Google Mobile is better, easier, and more fun 
than using Safari.

Instapaper Free
 
Free
As part of my daily ritual, I scan a dozen or more Web sites every morn-
ing for articles of interest. I often come across long articles that I’d like to 
read if I only had the time. So I use the handy Instapaper Read Later book-
mark I’ve saved in Safari on my Mac and on my iPhone, which adds the 
page to my unread items list in Instapaper and lets me get back to work.
Then, when I have down time, I launch Instapaper Free and catch up 
on my reading. The great part is that I can read one or all of the arti-
cles even when there’s no network access whatsoever, such as on an 
airplane, boat, or submarine.
That alone would be worth the price (Ha — it’s free!), but Instapaper 
also has a Graphical Pages setting that I turn off so that only the 
article’s text is captured by Instapaper, as shown in the figure on the 
left below. If I need to see the graphics, I click the link at the top of the 
article and the original page appears in Safari, complete with ads, ban-
ners, and other graphics, as shown in the figure on the right.
The bottom line
Instapaper Free lets me read lots of Web pages I might not get to read 
otherwise.

Lose  It!
 
Free
I’ve struggled with my weight for as long as I can remember. I’ve tried 
every diet and exercise program you’ve ever heard of and I’m on a first-
name basis with many of them — like Jenny, Weight, and Body For!
The truth is that I’ve never found anything as easy to track the calories 
I swallow (eat) and burn (exercise). And because my iPhone is always in 
my pocket, I tend to actually use it a lot more than any diary, notebook, 
worksheet, or other means of tracking I’ve ever tried.
I love being able to see at a glance how many calories I could still eat 
today without going over my budget, as shown in both figures below. 
On the left is an overview of my day; on the right are the details. As 
the figure shows, I could eat as many as 669 more calories today with-
out exceeding my budget.
Being able to see that info with just a couple of taps motivates me to 
stick to the plan much better than anything else I’ve ever tried.
The bottom line
The more I use the Lose It! app, the better I like it. And the free compan-
ion Web site, with stats, charts, and backups of your data, is a nice touch.

Now Playing
 
Free
I love movies and I use the Now Playing app all the time, even when 
I’m not planning a trip to a theatre. What I didn’t have the space to tell 
you back in Chapter 4 is that Now Playing is great for renting DVDs 
and checking out movies that aren’t even out yet.
For example, my family likes to rent DVDs. Because Now Playing has a 
comprehensive listing of recent and upcoming releases, we can sort by 
either release date or title. That means we can look at what DVDs came 
out last Tuesday, as shown in the figure on the left, and decide what we 
want to see before heading to our local Blockbuster or Redbox. You can 
also see the same information for Blu-ray discs if you want, but because 
I’m a Luddite without a Blu-ray player, I have that feature turned off.
Another cool feature is that I can look at movies being released in the 
coming weeks and months, such as Avatar, shown in the figure on the 
right below. I can watch the trailer (which, by the way, is great) right on 
my iPhone, or read about it at Amazon (www.amazon.com), the Internet 
Movie Database (www.imdb.com), or Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org).
The bottom line
If you like movies, even just a little, Now Playing is a fantastic resource.

Pandora Radio
 
Free
I love Pandora, and I listen to it all the time on my iPhone and on the 
Web (at www.pandora.com). It’s the best thing I’ve ever used to dis-
cover new music that I’m almost certain to like. The reason Pandora 
works so well is something called the Music Genome Project, which 
performs the Pandora magic behind the scenes. It consists of hundreds 
of musical attributes or “genes,” that together capture the unique and 
magical essence of a song — its melody, harmony, rhythm, instrumenta-
tion, orchestration, arrangement, lyrics, singing, and vocal harmony.
 
 If you’re curious about why a particular song was selected to play 
on a station you created, tap the little icon with the three white lines 
(shown in the margin) in the upper-right corner of the Now Playing 
screen (see the figure on the left).
Tap the Song button (the one that doesn’t say Artist) and you see a 
description of the musical characteristics that caused Pandora to play 
this track. The song in the figure on the left was played on my Byrds/
Tom Petty/Beatles channel, which I call “Jangly Guitars.”
Just for giggles, the figure on the right shows you the names of some 
of the Pandora Radio stations I’ve created for myself.
The bottom line
Want to hear new music you’re almost certain to enjoy? Get Pandora 
Radio.

reQall
 
Free
I think what I like best about reQall is that it remembers things for 
me with the least possible effort on my part. I say the words and tap 
the screen a couple of times, and my reminder magically shows up in 
my e-mail box a few minutes later, as shown in the figure below. And 
remember how I raved about Google Mobile’s speech-to-text recogni-
tion a few pages back? reQall isn’t as fast, but it’s usually just as accu-
rate. And if it’s not, the audio recording is enclosed with the e-mail 
message so that if I can’t understand what’s written, I can listen to 
what I actually said.
It’s awesome for jotting down quick thoughts at a red light or stand-
ing in the checkout line at the grocery store, which is generally when I 
remember something I need to do but can’t easily jot it down.
If I weren’t so cheap and had popped for a reQall Pro account, I could 
even reply to this reminder e-mail with words like done, delete, pend-
ing, or help.
The bottom line
reQall is free and incredibly useful. I can’t think of a single reason not 
to love it. I love it so much that it’s one of the sixteen icons on my 
home screen.

Skype
 
Free
It’s easy to explain why Skype is among my favorite apps — I’m cheap 
and it saves me a ton of dough. As I mentioned in Chapter 13, I use a 
SkypeIn phone number for my consulting business. This has several 
advantages over a traditional business landline:
 
✓ It’s much less expensive — using Skype costs me around $70 a 
year versus around $70 a month for the personal landline I still 
have in my home office.
 
✓ Because of the way Skype works, my SkypeIn line rings in my 
office, my Senior Agent-in-Charge’s office, and the office of any 
other agent who is logged in. And, by the way, we all live in differ-
ent parts of the U.S.
 
✓ I can manage our SkypeIn line right from my iPhone, as shown in 
the image on the left below.
 
 
✓ I can see at a glance whether I have business voice mail messages 
by checking the badge on the Skype icon (which says 6 in the 
icon shown in the margin).
 
✓ I can listen to business voice mail messages on my iPhone if I 
choose to. My staff sees the same messages in their Skype apps in 
Virginia, Minnesota, or wherever else they happen to be.
The bottom line
The app is free and offers numerous advantages to my business. And 
Skype services are a bargain compared to AT&T. What’s not to like?

GottaGo
 
 
$1 .99 US
Okay, faking an urgent phone call or text message 
is kind of sleazy and dishonest. So I use GottaGo 
only in emergencies. Like when a public relations 
person overstays her welcome (you know who 
you are), or a meeting drags on and on but noth-
ing is being accomplished.
Nobody has busted me or even looked suspi-
cious the few times I’ve actually used it. But it 
has gotten me out of several situations I des-
perately wanted to get out of.
A GottaGo fake text message is easy to set up and 
looks totally realistic, as shown in the figure on the 
left. The figure on the right shows how convinc-
ing an SMS text message looks on your screen.
Th e bottom line
Okay, it may be just a little sleazy or dishonest, but I’ve gotta tell you, 
it works like a charm. If you ever need to extract yourself from an 
unpleasant situation, you gotta get GottaGo.

iEmoticons — Emoji. Smiley, 
Emoticon Keyboard
 
$0.99 US
When I discuss this app in Chapter 16, I don’t have the space to show 
you what the Emoji emoticons look like. In the figure on the left below, 
you can see roughly ten percent of the little emoticons available for you 
to use in text and e-mail messages. In the figure on the right, you can 
see what they look like when you actually use them. To switch from the 
alphanumeric keyboard to the Emoji icons, you tap the little globe icon 
in the lower-left corner. Tap one of the icons on its right — the clock, 
smiley face, flower, bell, and so on — to reveal different sets of icons.
I like to use emoticons to create rebus puzzles for my wife, as shown 
in the figure on the right below. Can you figure out what it says? (The 
answer appears above the figure, in the section called “The bottom line.”)
Okay, they really don’t save me time or effort or make my life easier in any 
way, and it would be a stretch to call them artistic, but a friend got my wife 
into using them, and I couldn’t resist. They’re corny, but still kind of fun.
The bottom line
If you can stomach such things, Emoji icons are a great way to spice 
up otherwise boring text or e-mail messages.
Answer: The rebus in the figure on the right below says: “Honey, I love 
you bunches and bunches. Please call me tonight. Love and kisses.”
       

 
Jaadu VNC
 
$24.99  US
Say I’m out to dinner with my wife when my iPhone begins to vibrate 
in my pocket. I take a peek at the screen surreptitiously and see an 
urgent text message from my editor:
Chapter 18 is missing and drop-deadline is in less than an 
hour! Please say you can send me the final draft of it right 
now. If you can’t, our geese will be fricasseed.
Even if I ran out the restaurant door that very second, I couldn’t get 
home in time to save our ganders. But it’s no problem with Jaadu 
VNC on my iPhone. I launch it and, in seconds, I’m in control of my 
desktop Mac at home, commanding Microsoft Word to send the file to 
my editor as an attachment, as shown in the figure on the left below. 
My Mail program launches automatically and creates a message with 
the file enclosed. I quickly type a subject line and then click the Send 
Message button, as shown in the figure on the right below.
Crisis averted. Time elapsed between urgent text message and clicking 
Send Message: Under 3 minutes.
The bottom line
Jaadu V NC has saved my bacon (and my goose) more times than 
I care to count. It may seem expensive, but I’ve tried other iPhone 
virtual network computing (VNC) apps, and none is as reliable or 
elegantly designed as Jaadu VNC.

 Chapter 18: My Ten Favorite Paid Apps
 
MusicID with Lyrics
 
$2.99 US
In Chapter 9, I say pretty much all there is to say about MusicID with 
Lyrics. Simply put, nothing I’ve tried comes close to this app when it 
comes to identifying songs by hearing a snippet. And nothing else I’ve 
tried (at least not at this point in time) also provides lyrics for most of 
the songs it identifies. It works better than its better-known competi-
tor, Shazam Encore, and costs less to boot. Let me mention some of 
the obscure songs it identified correctly for me and one feature I don’t 
discuss in Chapter 9.
The obscure songs it successfully identified, in addition to those shown in 
the figure on the left below, included “Witch Doctor” by the Chipmunks, 
“What a Difference a Day Makes” by Dinah Washington, “On An Island” by 
David Gilmour, “Court and Spark” by Herbie Hancock, “Chick Habit” by 
April March, “Bohemian Rhapsody” by the California Guitar Trio, “Tarkus” 
by Emerson, Lake & Palmer, and “Prelude/Nothin’ to Hide” by Spirit.
The feature I didn’t have room for in Chapter 9 is called Similar 
Songs. Tap the Similar Songs button on any Song Info screen to see 
suggestions — like songs similar to King Crimson’s “In the Court of 
the Crimson King” that are shown in the figure on the right below. 
The bott om line
An iPhone app that listens to music and tells you the song title and 
artist’s name is one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen.

OldBooth Premium
 
$0.99 US
OldBooth Premium is just plain fun. In Chapter 10, I show a bunch of 
pictures of my wife and me that I defaced (pun intended) in OldBooth 
Premium. So now let me tell you why I love it and show you a little of 
the app.
As I explain in Chapter 10, you start by selecting a male or female 
mask from the nearly 60 that are included. The figure on the left shows 
a couple of each sex that you haven’t seen yet.
Then you choose a picture to deface. In the figure on the right, I’ve 
used a picture of me with my face rotated upside down so that you 
can better see how the mask and my picture interact. To rotate the 
picture, you merely drag on the ring visible in the figure on the right. 
You can adjust the brightness of the mask, the picture, or both to get 
a realistic effect.
The bottom line
Every iPhone owner I’ve ever defaced with OldBooth Premium — and 
I’ve defaced a lot of ‘em — ends up buying the app. It really is that 
much fun.

Pastie
 
$2.99 US
 I love my iPhone, but my rather large fingers aren’t designed for typing 
on those tiny keys. So any app that saves me from typing is an app I 
can appreciate. Pastie saves me a boatload of keystrokes every time I 
use it, and I appreciate that a lot.
As I mention in Chapter 11, Pastie lets you save commonly used 
expressions and messages and then paste them into an e-mail or SMS 
message or copy them to the clipboard. You can see some of my “pas-
ties” in the figure on the left below. If I tap the first one, the Messages 
app opens and the text contained in the first pastie (“I’m in a meet-
ing…”) appears on the iPhone clipboard so that I can paste it into a 
new text message (or messages) to send to whomever I choose.
The fourth pastie in that list has a contact, my wife, associated with it. 
When I tap it, the Messages app opens, but in this case, the message 
recipient is selected automatically, so all I have to do is paste the text 
and tap Send. Two taps.
Finally, if I tap the sixth pastie, a new mail message appears with the 
text already inserted, as shown in the figure on the right below.
The bottom line
The Pastie app saves me countless keystrokes every day. It’s a winner. 
Don’t tell the developer, but it’s worth more than three bucks to me.

QuickVoice2Text Ema il 
 
(PRO Recorder)
 
$0.99 US
As I’ve said before, my fat fingers aren’t exactly made for typing on an 
iPhone keyboard. So the more keystrokes an app can save me, the more 
I love the app. That’s why I love QuickVoice2Text Email so much.
Wonder how many keystrokes I save when I use it for a typical e-mail 
message? Say I’m in traffic and realize that I’m going to be late for 
dinner. I pull into a parking lot, launch QuickVoice2Text Email, tap the 
Record button, and say, “Honey, I’m running  late. Please put the coals 
on the BBQ. Thank you. I’ll be home at 8:00. Love you.” I tap the Email 
Recording as Text button, as shown in the figure on the left below, tap 
my wife’s e-mail address, and tap Send.
Elapsed time: Around one minute. Taps required: Fewer than 10. 
Keystrokes avoided: At least 99 (the number of characters in my 
message).
A few minutes later, my wife receives my message with the exact 
words I spoke (in quotes, no less), plus the audio file in case my voice 
wasn’t translated to text properly. The message she received is shown 
in the figure on the right below.
The bottom line
This 99¢ app saved me several minutes and kept me from having to 
type at least 99 characters. You have to love that, and I do.

RedLaser
 
$1.99 US
In Chapter 16, I tell you how awesome I think RedLaser is. But because 
a picture is worth a thousand words, and every picture tells a story, 
let me now show you why I love RedLaser so very much. . . .
I was cruising the aisles recently at a big-box retailer when I came 
upon a very cool digital camera that had an LCD display on its front as 
well as its back, making it great for self-portraits and such. I launched 
RedLaser and aimed my iPhone at the barcode on the box, as you can 
see in the figure on the left below. As soon as I held the iPhone still 
enough with the barcode aligned (which, as you can see by the blurry 
barcode, wasn’t easy for me), RedLaser beeped to tell me it had suc-
cessfully scanned the item. A few seconds later, the results, as shown 
in the figure on the right, appeared on my screen. After comparing the 
price in the store to what it cost online, I could see that I could save 
more than $50 by buying the camera online.
The bottom line
RedLaser costs less than $2. Using it this one time saved me more 
than $50. And that, gentle reader, is why RedLaser is one of my very 
favorite apps and, like the reQall app I discuss in Chapter 11, has 
earned one of the 16 spots on my home screen.
       

216
 
Reel Director
 
$7.99 US
I never thought a day would come when I could actually shoot a movie 
with my iPhone. And I really never thought I’d see an app that let me 
edit the video I shot; re-order, trim and split clips; add transitions, 
opening titles, and closing credits; and even apply the Ken Burns 
effect to still photos to simulate motion.
That’s all changed with Reel Director. The editing interface is great. You 
can drag clips in the timeline, as shown in the figure on the left below. 
You can trim clips, too, so don’t be afraid to keep the camera rolling. 
When you shoot, make sure your scene has adequate light. The video 
you shoot with your iPhone is noticeably darker than still photos. 
You can’t change the font size for titles, so make sure your title fits. 
My original title for the movie shown in both figures below was, 
“Spider-Man vs. The Dummies Man,” but the text ran off the screen. To 
make it fit, I changed it to the shorter title you can see. 
The bottom line
If you have an iPhone 3GS and enjoy making movies, you’ll love having 
Reel Director on your iPhone. Before I got Reel Director, I hardly ever 
shot video with my iPhone. These days, I love making movies with my 
iPhone, and I think you will, too.

Simplify Music 2
 
$5.99 US
Here’s the deal: With all the other stuff I have on my 32GB iPhone 3GS — 
the apps, videos, and photos — I only have enough space left for around 
2,500 songs. The problem is that I have more than 6,000 songs in my 
iTunes library, and I have a terrible time deciding which songs should be 
synced with my iPhone and which songs should be left behind.
For a mere $5.99, Simplify Music 2 makes it a total non-issue. As long as 
iTunes and the free Simplify Media server are running on my computer 
at home, I have access to all my playlists (some of which can be seen in 
the figure on the left below) and all 6,017 songs in my iTunes library.
But the coolest part is that two of my friends also have iTunes and the 
Simplify Media server running, as shown in the figure on the right, so I 
also have access to my friend Darrel’s (aka “dd” in the figure) 17,000+ 
songs and my friend Homer’s 11,000 songs!
The bottom line
Simplify Music 2 gives me access to all 6,017 songs in my iTunes 
library, plus tens of thousands of songs in my friends’ iTunes libraries. 
That rocks, and it’s worth a lot more than $5.99 to me!
       

19  Ten Things That Make 
Your iPhone Better
I spend a lot of time looking at iPhone 
and iPod peripherals and accessories as 
Reviews Director for the Mac Observer (www.
macobserver.com) and for my other writ-
ing gigs. In this chapter, I try to encapsulate 
everything I’ve learned by testing hundreds 
of products. Rest assured that the products 
I recommend in these pages are the ones I 
consider the very best in their categories.
Batteries
 Juice Pack Air: $80 US
Richard Solo 1800: $70 US
Kensington Travel Battery Pack and Charger: $70 US
If you hate when your iPhone runs out of juice in the middle of an 
important e-mail, movie, or game, you may want to invest in one or 
more external rechargeable batteries. The Juice Pack Air by Mophie is 
like a battery backpack for your iPhone. As you can see in the photo, 
it is almost unnoticeable and adds very little weight or bulk. It appears 
to be nothing more than a protective case, but it can come close to 
doubling your iPhone’s battery life.
The Richard Solo 1800 is the Swiss Army Knife of external batteries, 
with a built-in laser pointer and flashlight plus a hard-shell case.
Finally, I love the cleverly designed Kensington Travel Battery Pack 
and Charger, with its built-in dock connector and flip-out USB dongle. 
It’s great for travel because 
it has no cables to pack or 
lose. And its protective 
cap flips open and acts 
as a kickstand, making 
it perfect for hands-free 
movie viewing on a tray 
table and a great choice for 
long trips.

Bluetooth Headsets
Ja wbone PRIME: $130 US
Griffin SmartTalk: $100 US
Cardo S-2: $70 US
I’ve tested many Bluetooth headsets for hands-free calling with my 
iPhone. These three stand out as truly exceptional:
 
✓ Jawbone PRIME: The Jawbone PRIME headset from Aliph has 
outstanding military-grade noise elimination 
that suppresses ambient noise — such as 
traffic, helicopters, or the wind 
when you’re driving with the top 
down — better than any other 
Bluetooth headset I’ve ever tested. 
Furthermore, it’s comfortable, 
gorgeous, and available in seven 
cleverly-named colors including 
Frankly Scarlet, Going Platinum, 
Lilac You Mean It, and Drop Me a Lime. 
Jawbone Prime is somewhat expensive, but 
worth it if you need to make phone calls from 
noisy environments.
 
✓ SmartTalk Bluetooth: SmartTalk Bluetooth from Griffin 
Technologies has noise cancellation that’s good, although not 
quite as good as the Jawbone Prime, and is also quite comfort-
able. It isn’t nearly as handsome as the Jawbone Prime, at least 
not in my opinion, but it does have a feature the Jawbone does 
not — a human voice that confirms every operation.
 
✓ Cardo S-2: The Cardo S-2 headset is not only the least expen-
sive option, but it’s the only stereo Bluetooth headset I’ve liked 
enough to recommend. It’s bulkier than the others and doesn’t 
suppress noise as well as the others. (I don’t think it has any 
noise suppression circuitry whatsoever.) But it is the only one 
that offers stereo, making it the best (if not the only) choice for 
listening to music or playing games.

Car Audio Adapter/Charger
Mons ter Cable iCarPlay iPod Cassette Adapter: $20 US
Belkin TuneBase Direct with Hands Free: $70 US
Griffin iTrip Auto SmartScan: $80 US
RadTech AutoPower: $10–$17 US
A car audio adapter enables you to listen to music on your iPhone 
through your car stereo system. Of the three main types, here are my 
favorites:
 
✓ Auxiliary input: If you have a 
car stereo system that includes 
a 3.5mm auxiliary input jack, 
you can buy a cable at Ra dio 
Shack for less than $10 and 
simply plug one end into the 
car stereo’s input jack and the 
other end into your iPhone’s headphone 
jack. This setup offers the best possible 
sound quality but doesn’t recharge your 
iPhone. A nice (if pricey) solution is the 
Belkin TuneBase Direct with Hands Free, 
as shown here. It plugs into your car’s 
12v lighter outlet and charges your 
iPhone while also allowing you to use it 
for hands-free phone calls.
 
✓ Cassette adapter: If your car stereo includes a cassette tape 
player, this is an excellent choice — it’s inexpensive, it sounds 
better than an FM transmitter, and it’s small and easy to conceal 
if you feel the need. The one I like best and currently use is the 
Monster Cable iCarPlay.
 
✓ FM transmitter: This type of car adapter broadcasts your iPhone 
audio over FM radio. Plug it into your iPhone, tune your car 
radio to an unused frequency, and the music from your iPhone 
comes out of your car stereo speakers. Sound quality ranges from 
decent to horrid and can change from minute-to-minute as you 
drive. An FM transmitter would be my last choice; but if your car 
stereo doesn’t have a cassette player or auxiliary input jack, it 
may be your only option. If so, the Griffin iTrip Auto SmartScan is 
the best of the bunch.
One last thing: Even if you don’t want to listen to your iPhone in the car, 
you may want to recharge it. If so, I recommend the RadTech AutoPower 
Vehicle Socket USB charger, available with one or two USB ports.

Clarifi
$35 US
Clarifi from Griffin Technologies is a one-trick pony, and it’s only for 
the iPhone 3G. That said, it’s a great pony, it adds a great feature to 
your iPhone, and it’s integrated with a very nice hard shell case.
The one trick? The Clarifi case includes a built-in lens that lets you 
shoot macro and close-up photos in finer detail and with more accu-
rate color. It also improves the accuracy of apps that read bar codes, 
such as RedLaser (see Chapters 16 and 18). Without Clarifi, your 
iPhone requires you to be back at least 18 inches from your subject so 
the camera can focus; with Clarifi, you can shoot from as close as 
4 inches.
The lens slides into the durable polycarbonate hard shell case, which 
is available in black or white. A nice touch is that the bottom third of 
the case slides off, so it’s easier to use your iPhone in devices with an 
iPhone dock than it is with a lot of other cases.

Home Speakers
Logitech Rechargeable Speaker S315i: $130 US
iHome iP9BR Clo ck Radio for iPhone and iPod: $100 US
Audioengine 2: $200
If you want to listen to music around the house, you need a decent 
set of speakers. Lots of good iPhone speaker systems are available at 
prices ranging from less than $100 to thousands of dollars. The three 
I’ve picked for this section are each notable for at least one unique 
feature.
 
✓ Logitech Rechargeable Speaker S315i: This relatively compact 
system offers extremely good sound for its size. It only weighs a 
couple of pounds, so it’s easy to pick up and move to wherever 
you happen to be. And it’s rechargeable, so you can listen to 
music for up to 20 hours without plugging it in.
 
 
 
✓ iHome iP9BR Clock Radio: This system for iPhone and iPod is 
unique because of just what its name implies — it’s a clock radio 
that can use your iPhone as an audio source. It recharges your 
iPhone and lets you choose the song or playlist you want to wake 
up to. Other features include dual alarms, programmable snooze 
times, a remote control, and AM/FM radio. I really and truly love 
mine.
 
✓ Audioengine 2: These self-powered desktop speakers aren’t 
really iPhone speakers at all — they’re designed to work with 
any audio device, including your computer. The reason they’re 
included here is that they are, simply put, the best $200 speakers 
I have ever heard. And believe me, I’ve heard a lot. Enough said.

223
MovieWedge
$10 US
MovieWedge has to be one of the cleverest gadgets I’ve ever seen. It’s 
a flexible stand for your iPhone, but it works just as well for an iPod, or 
almost any other small handheld electronic device. It looks like a tiny 
beanbag chair with a little lip across its front side to secure your iPhone 
(or other device), as shown in the picture. It’s covered in soft microsuede 
and, unlike many iPhone stands and docks, it lets you adjust your iPhone 
to almost any angle for convenient hands-free viewing.
It’s great for watching movies and works almost anywhere (even on 
your knee, as you can see). It works with almost all protective cases 
and costs less than $10.
How can you not love that?

Protective Cases
iFrogz Luxe and Frosted Luxe: $35 US
RadTech ARC: $15 US
iSkin solo FX and FX Special Edition: $33 and $35
The iPhone is surprisingly resistant to scratches and dings, but I still 
feel better with something protecting mine. I’ve tested close to 100 of 
’em; here are three I recommend without hesitation:
 
✓ iFrogz Luxe and Frosted Luxe: I love the iFrogz Luxe and Frosted 
Luxe cases. And I can’t count the number of friends and colleagues 
who love theirs. The Luxe has a beautiful metallic finish that feels 
great and makes your iPhone a bit less slippery. The Frosted Luxe 
is semi-transparent but feels just as nice to the touch. The Luxe 
comes in Royal Blue, Red Ruby, Thick Black, Medium Magenta, and 
several other colors; the Frosted Luxe is available in clear, lime, 
pink, purple, or turquoise. Everyone I know loves these ultra-thin, 
lightweight cases, and I’m sure you will, too.
 
✓ RadTech ARC: The RadTech ARC is almost exactly the same as 
the iFrogz Luxe but sells for half the price. The difference is that 
iFrogz offers more colors, prettier colors, and the Frosted varia-
tion. The ARC has the same metallic finish and feels good to the 
touch but comes in only black, silver, blue, or red. 
 
✓ iSkin sol o FX: I really love the iSkin solo FX (shown here) and 
solo FX Special Edition. Made of a soft, semi-stretchy, jelly-like 
material, they look great, feel great, and, unlike the iFrogz and 
RadTech offer-
ings, include 
a screen pro-
tector. They 
provide better 
protection than 
the iFrogz or 
RadTech offer-
ings, and the 
Special Edition 
is treated with 
Microban 
antimicrobial 
protection, 
to inhibit the 
growth of stains 
and bacteria.

Screen Protection
invisibleSHIELD for iPhone: Full body coverage — $25 US
Front coverage only — $15 US
Back coverage only — $19 US
RadTech ClearCal 2-pack: $10–$13 US
Case-Mate Full Face Privacy Screen: $20 US
Regardless of whether you use a case with your iPhone, you may want 
to protect its screen. If you bought one of the iSkin cases I recommend 
earlier, you’re already protected. For everyone else, here are some 
suggestions:
 
✓ invisibleSHIELD: invisibleSHIELD for iPhone is a clear, virtually 
indestructible film that protects your iPhone from scratches and 
scuffs. The precision-cut film applies directly to your iPhone and 
is probably the most durable protection available. The film had 
its origins in the military, which used it to protect helicopter 
blades from dust, dirt, and debris. If you choose the full body 
coverage invisibleSHIELD, you won’t need a case (although the 
cases described in the previous section offer better protection 
against drops and impacts).
 
✓ ClearCal: RadTech ClearCal screen protectors are available for 
the whole front of your iPhone or only the display. They’re avail-
able in anti-glare, clear, and mirrored finishes and are the least 
expensive option; you get two protectors for about $13.
 
✓ Case-Mate Privacy Screen Pro: The Case-Mate Privacy Screen 
Pro covers the whole front of your iPhone and, in addition to pro-
viding protection, it prevents anyone who isn’t directly in front 
of the screen from seeing what’s on it. Alas, if they’re behind you 
looking over your shoulder, you’re out of luck.

Travel Speakers
Livespeakr: $80 US
iMainGo2: $40 US
Altec-Lansing Orbit MP3: $50 US
I like to have musi c available at all times, and I don’t like earphones if 
I can avoid them. So I’ve tested lots of travel speakers over the years. 
You can’t go wrong with any of these:
 
✓ Livespeakr: This is the most expensive travel speaker of the 
bunch, but it’s also the best-sounding and the only one with 
at least a semblance of stereo 
sound. It’s rechargeable, has 
a cool iPhone cradle that 
rotates, has an integrated 
stand that’s great for watch-
ing video (as shown), and 
includes a nifty velour 
carrying bag.
 
✓ iMainGo: This is a combination iPhone case and high-
performance speaker. In my 5-star (out of 5) review of the 
original iMainGo, I said, 
“With its reasonable 
price tag, tiny size, 
huge sound, and quality 
construction, iMainGo 
is without a doubt the 
best ultra-portable iPod 
speaker system I’ve 
seen to date. Or, as my 
18-year old daughter 
puts it, ‘That thing 
is soooo tight!’” The 
iMainGo2 sounds better 
than the original and 
costs $20 less.
 
✓ Orbit: The Altec-Lansing Orbit MP3 is smaller than the others, 
but still sounds great. It runs for days on three AAA batteries, 
has a nice little protective case, and has wrap-around cable 
storage.

Wired Headsets
Klipsch Image S4i In-Ear Headset with Mic and Three-Button Remote: $100 US
Scosche IDR350m In creased Dynamic Range earphones with tapLINE 
control: $55 US
iFrogz EarPollution Plugz with Mic: $20 US
There’s no nice way to put it — the white headset that comes with the 
iPhone stinks. It’s uncomfortable and sounds mediocre at best. Here 
are some replacement headsets at several price points.
The Klipsch Image S4i In-Ear Headset with Mic and Three-Button 
Remote is the best-sounding iPhone headset I’ve tried to date. They 
reproduce sound accurately, are very comfortable even for extended 
wear, and come with three different ear tip sizes, an ear tip cleaning 
tool, a carrying pouch, and a clothing clip. If you can afford these 
babies, you won’t be disappointed.
Scosche IDR350m Increased 
Dynamic Range earphones with 
tapLINE control are roughly half 
the price of the Klipsch but sound 
almost as good and are almost as 
comfortable. No pouch or cloth-
ing clip, but you do get snap-on 
covers in six colors.
Finally, the iFrogz EarPollution 
Plugz with Mic don’t sound quite 
as good as either the Scosche or 
Klipsch headsets. But they only 
cost $20, sound noticeably better 
than the stock Apple headset, and 
are available in five vibrant colors 
as well as silver (shown here).
