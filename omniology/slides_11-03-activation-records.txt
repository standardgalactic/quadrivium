Activation Records 

Alex Aiken 
Activation Records 
• The information needed to manage one procedure 
activation is called an activation record (AR) or frame 
 
• If procedure F calls G, then G’s activation record 
contains a mix of info about F and G. 

Alex Aiken 
Activation Records 
• F is “suspended” until G completes, at which point F 
resumes 
 
• G’s AR contains information needed to  
– Complete execution of G 
– Resume execution of F 
 

Alex Aiken 
Activation Records 
• Space for G’s return value 
• Actual parameters 
• Pointer to the previous activation record 
– The control link; points to AR of caller of G 
•  Machine status prior to calling G 
– Contents of registers & program  counter 
– Local variables 
• Other temporary values

Class Main { 
 g() : Int { 1 }; 
 f(x:Int):Int {if x=0 then g() else f(x - 1)(**)fi}; 
 main(): Int {{f(3); (*) 
 }};} 
 
AR for f: 
result 
argument 
control link 
return address

Alex Aiken 
Activation Records 
• Main has no argument or local variables and its result is 
never used; its AR is uninteresting 
• (*) and (**) are return addresses of the invocations of f 
– The return address is where execution resumes after a 
procedure call finishes 
 
• This is only one of many possible AR designs 
– Would also work for C, Pascal, FORTRAN, etc.

invocation of f returns

Alex Aiken 
Activation Records 
• The advantage of placing the return value 1st in a frame 
is that the caller can find it at a fixed offset from its own 
frame 
 
• There is nothing magic about this organization 
– Can rearrange order of frame elements 
– Can divide caller/callee responsibilities differently 
– An organization is better if it improves execution 
speed or simplifies code generation 

Alex Aiken 
Activation Records 
• Real compilers hold as much of the frame as possible 
in registers 
– Especially the method result and arguments 
 

Alex Aiken 
Activation Records 
 
The compiler must determine, at compile-time, the 
layout of activation records and generate code that 
correctly accesses locations in the activation record 
 
Thus, the AR layout and the code generator must be 
designed together!
