Need to Know
8 17 - 30 May 2017
What happened?
The popular media-centre software
Kodi has hit back at criticism of its new
policy of supporting DRM, explaining in
a blog post (bit.ly/kodi423) that this is
only to allow restricted content to play
on its own system.
DRM (digital-rights management) is
a euphemism for technology and
standards that lock down who can view
copyrighted content, to ensure it’s only
seen by those who have paid for it and
not pirates. Kodi doesn’t have a DRM
system built in because the open-source
licence it’s released under forbids such a
restriction. “Kodi will never, ever require
DRM to work, nor will it ever be a locked
software”, said the Kodi team.
However, Kodi wants to be able to
play Netflix and other paid-for content
directly through its software, so you
don’t have to switch between apps to
watch films and TV shows on your
television. To do that, Kodi uses the
DRM tools in Android and Chrome,
which allow it to stream content without
offering its own DRM support. Kodi’s
developers argue that supporting DRM
in this limited, “low-level” way will
change negative perceptions about
their software.
The move comes as the Digital
Economy Act comes into force. The
much-debated legislation includes an
increase in the potential prison time
faced by pirates for illegally streaming
copyrighted content, from two years to
10. So far, the authorities and rights
holders such as the film industry have
targeted people selling set-top boxes
preloaded with Kodi, as well as the
websites making the streams available.
However, the legal change means that
anyone streaming pirated content – via
Kodi, a browser or any other method – is
technically at risk of up to 10 years in
prison.
How will it affect you?
Here’s how Kodi’s DRM system works:
Android has its own software to play
DRM content, so Kodi simply uses that
– as the user, you don’t need to do
anything. In Windows, it’s more complex
because the Kodi software can’t
connect to Netflix or other paid-for
streaming providers. However, Chrome
can do this, so Kodi uses the browser to
handle the DRM while streaming
continues inside the Kodi software. If
you don’t have Chrome on your system,
you presumably won’t be able to play
Netflix. Kodi doesn’t come with the DRM
bits and pieces itself, but borrows them
from Google.
The Digital Economy Act probably
won’t be used to target individuals with
legal action for using Kodi to stream
pirated content – but if it does happen,
the risks are huge. You could be jailed
for up to 10 years for illegal streaming,
but the authorities are more likely to go
after those making the streams available
or selling preloaded boxes.
What do we think?
The makers of Kodi are right to offer
support for DRM, for two reasons. First,
many Kodi users rely on its simplicity,
and DRM means you don’t have to keep
switching between apps. Supporting
paid-for subscriptions means Kodi can
remain your one-stop shop for
streaming video and make watching TV
shows and films as easy as possible.
Second, it’s true that Kodi is seen as
linked to piracy, and offering support
for paid-for streams such as Netflix
could help change that reputation. If
Kodi is only used for pirated content, it’s
hard to argue that it’s not facilitating
dodgy streaming, but if it’s also used for
watching paid-for, legal content, the
case against it becomes weaker.
And that’s key with the Digital
Economy Act coming into force. The
developers behind Kodi argue their
system is no different than Firefox or
Chrome – either of which can be used
for piracy, but weren’t designed for it.
Adding support for paid-for content,
even if it requires this light, low-level
support for DRM, helps Kodi make its
case that it’s a legitimate piece of
software, not a piracy platform.
Kodi fights piracy by adding
“low-level” DRM support
Kodi clarified its position on DRM in a
rather defensive blog post

Need to Know
What happened?
Microsoft has unveiled a
new version of Windows,
called Windows 10 S, which
is designed to compete
with Google’s Chrome OS
and the Chromebook
laptops that run the
cut-down operating
system.
Windows 10 S is
designed for education
markets, and will only run
apps from its own online
store. It’s also locked down
for browsing, which means
you’ll only be able to use
Microsoft’s Edge browser
and search using Bing.
Other than those
restrictions, Windows 10 S
is the full-fat version of the
OS, and comes with
security and administration
tools that are available in
Windows 10 Pro but not
Windows 10 Home. It will
arrive 15 June on the
Microsoft Surface laptop.
How will it affect you?
Windows 10 S is currently
limited to laptops for
schools and universities,
who will be able to switch
to the new OS for free. It
will eventually extend to
Microsoft launches
Windows 10 S
other budget devices (as
Chrome OS has), with HP
and Acer set to launch
laptops running the OS this
summer for $299 (£230)
and other PC makers
expected to pitch in, too.
The main restriction is
the apps. Many popular
Desktop apps, including
Chrome, aren’t yet
available in the Windows
Store. If you buy a laptop
running the restricted OS,
you’ll be able to upgrade to
Windows 10 Pro for $49
(£38).
What do we think?
There’s value in locking
down the OS, particularly
for students or users who
aren’t security-savvy. This
could make Windows 10 S
devices ideal for young
children, or PC users who
need Word and Edge and
little else. However, anyone
who uses more advanced
software should wait
before switching to
Windows 10 S. Windows 10
laptops are already
available at budget prices,
so there’s no need to lock
yourself into the restricted
OS without good reason.
What
happened?
A phishing
attack hit
Google’s
authentication
system by
sending users
an email
containing a
fake Google
Docs sharing
link. If victims
clicked the link, the
attacker installed a web
app via Google’s
authentication system,
which asked for
permissions such as
reading your email and
managing your contacts.
The dodgy app could then
grab data including your
contacts list, which could
be exploited to further
spread the attack.
In response, Google
blocked the dodgy app
and revealed a new
warning tool that displays
a message to Gmail users
on Android smartphones
when they’re about to click
a link that goes to a known
malicious site.
How will it affect you?
Although Google acted
quickly to halt the phishing
scam, more such ploys are
bound to follow because
the technique behind the
attack remains open to
abuse. That means you
should be careful when
opening links purporting to
share Google Docs, and
only click them if you’re
sure they are safe. Because
the link may appear to be
coming from a known
contact, it would be worth
Phishing scam hits
Google Docs
checking with that person
first before clicking to open
the link.
You should also check to
see whether you have any
unexpected apps
authorised in Google. To
do this, head to the My
Account section of your
Google profile and, under
Sign-in & Security, click
‘Connected apps & sites’.
You can then view the apps
that are connected to your
account, and remove any
you no longer need or
don’t recognise.
What do we think?
Google needs to do more
than take out this specific
attack, it needs to prevent
similar ones from
happening in the future.
The warning message is a
useful tool, but past
performance shows that
many people will likely
ignore it and click through
to the dodgy site anyway.
In the meantime, as
usual, make sure anyone
you know who isn’t as tech
savvy as you is aware of
this type of attack. You can
also run a security check of
your Google accounts at
g.co/SecurityCheckup.

FIRST LOOK

Acer Leap Ware
www.acer.com
The Acer Leap Ware is the company’s
first smartwatch that’s been designed
with the fashion-conscious in mind.
It’s set to cost ¤139 (approx £118) and
will launch later this year. We got to
try it out on a rooftop at Acer’s Global
Press Conference in New York City
and our initial impressions were
mostly positive.
Its most impressive feature is its
fitness monitor. The Leap Ware uses a
MediaTek MT2523 chipset and MT2511
bio-sensing chip to calculate how
hard you’re training. The technology
involved is actually quite simple – you
just need a heart-rate monitor, the
wearer’s age and a simple calculation
– but a surprising number of
smartphones still do not offer this
wearable, the Liquid
Leap. But the Leap
Ware’s smart circular
face, made from
Corning Gorilla Glass
SR+, and choice of a
sporty rubber or more
formal leather strap,
means it looks stylish
on your wrist.
On the downside,
we were disappointed
with the Leap’s
performance. Swiping
around the Android
Wear screen was a
pretty laggy affair. So
although we can’t see
the Acer Leap Ware electrifying the
wearables market from its slumber,
we do think it’s a solid effort that
offers pretty good value for money.
What happened?
Facebook has refuted claims that it
helps advertisers target young users
who may be feeling “overwhelmed and
anxious”. An internal Facebook research
paper, seen by The Australian
newspaper, allegedly details how the
company can monitor the activity of
users as young as 14 years old to work
out when they are feeling “useless”,
“nervous”, “defeated”, “stressed”,
“overwhelmed”, “silly”, “anxious”, and
“stupid”. It also said Facebook can tell
when teenagers are happy or excited.
A Facebook spokesperson called the
accusations “misleading”, telling Web
User’s sister site IT Pro: “We do not offer
tools to target people based on their
emotional state. The analysis done by an
Australian researcher was intended to
help marketers understand how people
express themselves on Facebook. It was
never used to target ads and was based
on data that was anonymous.”
The technology used by Facebook to
gather this data, known as ‘sentiment
analysis’, is common throughout the
advertising and marketing industries.
It’s often used by companies to
determine how certain demographics
feel about a particular product, brand or
event, using social-media tools such as
trending topics and hashtags.
In a separate statement, Facebook
told The Australian that “Facebook has
Facebook denies exploiting unhappy teens
an established process to review the
research we perform. This research did
not follow that process, and we are
reviewing the details to correct the
oversight,” the company added.
How will it affect you?
It’s a horrifying thought that advertisers
are exploiting teenagers’ negative
emotions to push products at them. It’s
already a concern for parents that their
children ‘over share’ on Facebook, let
alone that the content and comments
they post may be used for financial gain.
Although Facebook says such data is
collected anonymously, this revelation
still serves as a reminder that the site is
a monetised public arena, not a private
communication tool.
What do we think?
It’s no secret that Facebook shares its
users’ data with advertisers, but the
shock of this particular story – at least as
initially reported – was that vulnerable
teenagers were being targeted as well
as over-sharing adults. We’re not totally
convinced by Facebook’s denial – after
all, personalised advertising is how the
social network makes its billions – but at
least in this instance it appears to admit
that exploiting unhappy young users is
inappropriate, or an “oversight” to use
the company’s own term.
functionality.
Another standout
feature is the Leap
Ware’s five-day
battery life. How is
the battery
performance so
good? It’s all down
to its e-Ink display.
e-Ink doesn’t make
for the most
attractive display,
but it’s great for
increasing a device’s
battery life and can
also work in harshly
lit environments.
However, where
the device really excels is in its looks.

tablet screen to see which of you blinks first. As you progress through the levels,
the contenders get tougher and try to distract you with random movements and
background activity, but keep your eyes fixed and open and you stand a chance
of emerging triumphant. The idea came to the creator in a dream, and had yet to
raise any money at the time of writing, but it’s certainly worth a look!
According to multiple sources,
Apple will not release the iPhone 8
in 2017 – just the boring old iPhone
7S. The sources say Apple is
experiencing a lot of problems with
getting the iPhone 8 built in the
desired numbers.
Production woes had already
pushed back the release of the
handset by a couple of months to
around November, according to
tech-news site BGR, but that date
has now been further delayed with
the news that it might not even get
a release until next year.
“Report suggests no new iPhone
8 this calendar year,” wrote analysts
at Deutsche Bank. “As we have
written in previous [research notes],
several supply chain reports have
suggested that key component
shortages and technical challenges
could delay the release of a high-
end iPhone 8 device this fall.”
The iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus
are apparently on track for a release at
Apple’s usual time of around
September, although we can’t see too
many people getting excited by these
handsets when the prospect of the
radically redesigned iPhone 8 has been
dangled in front of their noses.
It was recently revealed that in the
first three months of the year, iPhone
sales dipped for the first time, a decline
that Apple CEO Tim Cook blamed on
leaks about the iPhone 8.
Will the iPhone 8 be
delayed until 2018?

LIKELIHOOD RATING
✓✓✓✓✓
Hype around the iPhone 8 is at
an all-time high, so we’re not
convinced that Apple would
purposely delay the handset in
favour of the underwhelming
iPhone 7S range. We reckon the
latter two will be released at
budget prices (by Apple’s
standards) alongside the
iPhone 8, come September.

Q
Other than
changing my
passwords
regularly, what can I do
to protect them against
hackers?

Botnet malware infects
millions of Android devices
A new strain
of malware
hidden
inside apps
on the
Google Play
store has
infected close to two million Android
devices over the past year, according
to security experts monitoring
the spread.
The recently discovered malware,
known as ‘FalseGuide’, has been
found in more than 45 Google Play
store apps that provide guides and
walkthroughs for mobile games.
Some of these apps have been
installed 50,000 times, according to
security researchers at Check Point,
who first discovered the strain.
Once installed, the FalseGuide
malware is able to hijack a device and
add it to a larger botnet. The device
is then used to display pop-up ads
containing malicious code, conduct
password security watertight:
• Make every password at
least 15 characters long – the
longer the better – and
combine letters (including
uppercase letters), numbers
and symbols.
• Don’t make them easily
guessable. There’s a good
chance that personal details
such as your date of birth,
place of birth, partner’s name
and so on can be found
online – maybe even on your
Facebook wall.
• Don’t use real words.
They are open to ‘dictionary
attacks’, where someone
uses a program to quickly try
a huge list of possible words
until they find one that
matches your password.
• Make passwords unique
for every account: don’t
‘recycle’ them, for example
‘david1’, ‘david2’ and ‘david3’.
• Use a password manager
that encrypts and stores
unique passwords for all your
accounts in one consolidated
and protected location.
• Consider a tiered
approach to password
management instead of
a one-size-fits-all strategy.
Create strong, unique
passwords for important
online accounts, where a
compromise would have
serious consequences:
for example, those linked
to credit cards. But use
a simpler password for
accounts where no
sensitive personal data
is stored.
• Don’t continually
change your password.
There’s no need to change
it just for the sake of it,
and it’s difficult to
remember a new one
every few weeks.
• Don’t save your
password – the “save
your password” option
offered by browsers may
be convenient, but it’s
not as secure as using
a password manager.

Weak passwords are behind
most security breaches
A new report has found that the majority
of security breaches take advantage of
simple passwords. Verizon’s
annual Data Breach
Investigations Report
revealed that of the 2,000
breaches and security
incidents it analysed,
a whopping 81% used
easily-guessed or stolen
passwords. Furthermore,
over 65% of malware
infections were delivered
via email attachments –
a technique that has been
around for decades.
Pretexting – where a hacker pretends
to be someone else to obtain private
information – is also on the rise, while
ransomware has increased by 50%
compared to last year’s report.
Verizon revealed that organised
crime gangs were behind more than
half of all security breaches, while
almost 70% of all threats to healthcare
companies come from within and
around 50% of attacks on educational
institutions were perpetrated by
state-affiliated hackers.

HuffPost
www.huffpost.com
The Huffington Post has been making
headlines of its own, thanks to its first
ever redesign and the surprise decision
to adopt its snappier nickname as a new
brand. Although most of the changes are
currently confined to the US version,
the site provides a foretaste of what’s set
to come in its UK offering. Aside from the
new logo, pages now look bolder and
make more creative use of photos. Its use
of video helps drive the day’s news
agenda and there is clearer highlighting
of the top stories together with more
space for the articles. Less chock-a-block
and relentless, it makes for a much more
readable and easy-to-browse offering.
Flubit
flubit.com
Flubit is a shopbot that lets you enter
links from Amazon to find alternative
UK-based online retailers offering
discounted deals. It used to take hours
to get a price but now the costs for
millions of products are displayed
instantly. What’s more, when our searches
matched an item (not all of them did),
they tended to be cheaper. We like the
new, clear product pages detailing the
delivery slot and company together with
stock availability. But we were
disappointed by the small images and
dull descriptions accompanying items.

Lounge Books
www.lounge-books.com
As if to prove that you should never judge a book by its cover, this cleanly presented
site is run on a shoestring budget of £2,000 yet looks a million dollars. Curated by a
former project manager at publisher HarperCollins, as well as authors and bloggers, it
helps readers discover new books and covers a host of searchable genres, from sci-fi
and kids’ books to romance and book porn (by which we mean beautifully designed
special editions!). In doing so, it feels fresh and non-elitist, with a selection of exciting,
low-cost ebooks and multiple reviews of each tome. The latest books are flagged on
the homepage and the email newsletter keeps you up to date with additions. There’s
a good range of literary gifts, too, including mugs, cushions and pencils.

The Clash, Web User forums
A
The external links shouldn’t stop
working but if you want your site
to utilise ‘https’ and not ‘http’
(‘https’ being the more secure of the two),
you would need to instruct any traffic
coming to the website to redirect any
requests for ‘http’ to ‘https’ – therefore
ending up at the same place. For example,
if an external link is http://www.nublue.co
.uk, it can be forwarded to https://www
.nublue.co.uk. This can be handled with
a rewrite condition within your website’s
‘.htaccess’ file. If you’re not sure where this
is, contact your web host’s support.

I
f you’ve been following our
reviews in recent issues
of Web User, you’ll have
noticed the arrival of ‘mesh’
Wi-Fi routers, which use two
or more devices to create
a better spread of coverage
around your home – and it
looks like they’re here to stay.
We reviewed Netgear’s Orbi
in Issue 415 (bit.ly/issue415),
Devolo’s GigaGate in Issue
417 (bit.ly/webuser417) and
BT Whole Home Wi-Fi in
Issue 419 (bit.ly/issue419).
All these devices use multiple
base stations to create better
Wi-Fi where you need it.
Google Wifi, however, is
different for a number of key
reasons. First, it uses the
802.11s mesh Wi-Fi standard,
Google Wifi
which Google says isn’t being
used by any of the other
residential mesh routers. This
is something Google has been
working on with the IEEE
standards body since it began
the Google Wifi project some
four years ago, and it brings
with it a number of benefits
over the proprietary systems
employed by other vendors.
The most important
advantage is interoperability.
As yet, no other manufacturer
scan your local network
environment, Google Wifi can
send information about signal
strength and congestion back
to Google’s servers, which in
turn analyse the data and
send back information to the
units about how and when
to hop channels to maintain
a strong signal.
This is all very clever but on
a more fundamental level,
if you want the best coverage,
you need to have the right
number of devices. On that
front, Google Wifi offers good
value for money, costing £229
for a twin pack and £129 for
each single box thereafter.
That may seem expensive in
comparison to regular routers,
but it’s competitive with its
Google adds its name to the roster of manufacturers making
mesh Wi-Fi routers. Jonathan Bray compares Wifi to its rivals
is using the 802.11s standard,
so only Google’s Wifi boxes
work with the system, which
means they include a degree
of future-proofing: if you buy
Google Wifi now, you may be
able to upgrade your network
by adding less expensive
devices later on.
Further advantages come
from Google’s machine-
learning, which it incorporates
into its units. By using a
dedicated sensing radio to

Google Wifi Product Test
Google Wifi is an
impressive device for a
company making its first
forays into wireless
networking. Not only is it
competitively priced but it
offers impressive coverage
and is stacked with clever
technology to make your
life easier.
We particularly like the
app-based configuration
tool, which feels like a step
forward compared to the
browser tools that most
routers still use.
However, it isn’t the
fastest system around – BT
Whole Home Wi-Fi holds
that accolade.
Netgear Orbi, £369
bit.ly/orbi423
Xxxxx xx xx xxxx xxxxx
BT Whole Home Wi-Fi,
£299 bit.ly/btwhw423
rivals, being a slightly cheaper
starter option than the BT
Whole Home Wi-Fi, which is
£250 for a three-pack on
Amazon, and better value
than the Netgear system
(£369 for two).
You also need to bear in
mind that each of the units
in a Google Wifi system is
a fully fledged router in its
own right. They don’t have
a broadband gateway built in
so you’ll still need a modem
or router to bring your
connection from the wall
socket, but you get dual-band
802.11ac connectivity with
theoretical speeds of up to
1,200Mbps over 5GHz, along
with a pair of Gigabit Ethernet
ports built into the base of
each cylindrical unit.
Setup and app
Unlike regular routers, Google
Wifi can’t be administered or
set up via your browser; you
have to use either the Android
or the iOS app. Fortunately,
the app is brilliant and takes
you step by step through the
setup, starting with
connecting the first unit to
your existing router or
modem, through to setting up
any additional devices.
You may find that you have
to restart your modem or
router but the entire process
should take less than 15
minutes. The setup analyses
your network as you go to
make sure you’ve placed the
devices in the best possible
position, and uses the status
LEDs wrapped around each
unit’s circumference to
indicate the strength of the
connection to the rest of
the network.
After setting up your mesh,
you only need to open the
app if you want to use the
additional tools. Parental
controls, or “Family WiFi”
as Google calls it, lets you
block devices or groups of
devices on a schedule. It’s
also possible to pause
internet access manually
if you want to immediately
cut someone’s connection.
By default, guest networks
are kept completely separate
from your main network,
so visitors can’t access file
shares or network storage,
but Google’s clever system
can provide access to devices
such as Chromecasts and
wireless speakers with
a single click.
You can also use the app
to access more advanced
settings such as port-
forwarding, custom DNS
(Domain Name System) and
setting the network mode,
although there’s no way to
separate the 2.4GHz and
5GHz bands, with Google Wifi
taking control of connecting
your devices to the most
appropriate one. It also uses
another technique called
“client steering” to ensure
laptops, phones and tablets
connect to the unit with the
strongest signal.
The most important thing
to recognise about Google
Wifi is that if you have enough
units, you’ll always get a
strong Wi-Fi signal, no matter
where you are in your home.
Signal strength and
speed
We tested Google Wifi in
a narrow Victorian terraced
house that spans three storeys
and has rooms divided by
thick brick walls. Two units
were enough to provide
a solid signal in all parts of
the house at the full 38Mbps
offered by the existing
Sky Broadband connection.
However, this isn’t the
fastest mesh Wi-Fi system
around. The BT Whole Home
Wi-Fi system, for instance,
has faster speeds at both
close and long range, as does
the Netgear Orbi. That’s not
surprising, though, as those
systems offer tri-band
connectivity and are able
to transfer data at higher
rates between devices.
One thing we should point
out, though: don’t just buy
a single Google Wifi unit with
a view to adding more later
because you’ll almost
certainly suffer a downgrade
in long-range connectivity
and throughput. We tested
a single unit from a kitchen
extension at the rear of the
house and it provided
a usable but slow 5Mbps
download throughput to our
test laptop.

The Moto G5 Plus is a great
handset, but it isn’t the
all-rounder we were hoping
for. However, it looks good,
is reasonably responsive
and the camera is superb.
If you’re a keen

nothing else at this price

However, if you’re after
something more practical,
there are better handsets
out there. Our current
favourite is the Lenovo P2.
It has a better-quality
AMOLED screen,
a stupendously good
battery life and although
its camera doesn’t compare
with the Moto G5 Plus,
it’s adequate in good light.

Jonathan Bray reviews a mid-priced
phone with a fantastic camera
beautifully vivid and sharp,
and performance was equally
good in low light.
The G5 Plus runs with
standard Android 7 with a few
typical Moto embellishments.
It’s not weighed down with
preloaded guff, and the extras
you get are sensibly thought
cheaper sibling, but every
other major feature is present
and correct, including
expandable storage (up to
128GB), splash resistance,
NFC for mobile payments and
a fingerprint reader.
Performance is good for the
price. In our benchmark tests,
it was significantly faster than
the basic G5 and slightly
ahead of the similarly priced
Lenovo P2 and Honor 6X.
It lasted for 13 hours and
13 minutes in our looping
video test, which isn’t
remarkable but will get you
through a day on one charge.
The screen is nothing to
write home about, and is the
same resolution as last year’s
G4 Plus. Its viewing angles are
great but it’s not bright
enough (only 401cd/m2
at maximum brightness)
and the colours look a little
murky. According to our
colorimeter, it only
reproduces 73.4% of the
sRGB colour standard, though
the contrast is good at 1,149:1.
A common complaint about
most mid-priced phones is
that their cameras tend to be
disappointing, but the rear
camera on the Moto G5 Plus
bucks this trend. It uses the
same camera module as the
Samsung Galaxy S7, which the
imaging experts at DxOMark
(www.dxomark.com) believe
to be the second best
smartphone camera available,
behind Google’s Pixel phones.
We were taken aback by
the impressive quality of the
photos: in daylight, they look
through, especially the
gesture shortcuts.
The new version of the
Moto app lets you use the
rectangular fingerprint reader
on the front of the phone as
a navigation key. However, we
found it awkward to use and
it’s the first thing we’d turn
off, except that without it,
tapping the reader with your
thumb doesn’t take you to the
home screen – instead, it
switches off the phone, which
is something we’ve done by
accident more than once.
W
ith previous
versions of the
Moto G range,
we’ve recommended the
basic smartphone rather than
the Plus edition, because
they were better value for
money. However, this year
we’re going with the Moto
G5 Plus because it’s faster,
has a better camera, looks
nicer and is only £80 more
than the standard G5.
It’s a smaller phone than
last year’s model, with a 5.2in,
1,080 x 1,920 pixels resolution
IPS screen. It doesn’t have
a removable battery like its
Images look beautifully vivid and sharp,
and it performed equally well in low light

Partition Master is a powerful tool that can
create, resize, format and delete drive partitions,
as well as convert, explore and hide partitions,
and change drive letters. The software can also
copy disks and volumes – which is handy if
you’re cloning a drive – and wipe drives, recover
data and rebuild a damaged or missing master
boot record. You need a bit of knowledge to
understand partitioning, but the software itself
is very easy to use.
The latest version introduces some

supports the 4KB sector disk better. It also
changes drive numbers to match those used

compressed files by email.

Open Source is “like baking a cake

Get a Firefox clock to strike

Despite the little clock

easy to lose track of time
when you’re browsing the
web, so why not have
Firefox remind you of the
hour, every hour? That’s the
idea behind Grandfather
Fox (bit.ly/grand423),
which chimes like the titular classic clock at the top of each hour. If you’re not
a fan of “bing bong, bing bong”, you can go into the add-on’s Options to choose
another audio alert, including cuckoo clock, single beep and multiple progressive
beeps. The developer of Grandfather Fox claims that it “promotes time
awareness, while also giving your home office a touch of class”. We wouldn’t go
quite that far but it’s certainly a fun little audio enhancement.
Switch to the mobile

You may not regard Wikipedia as
a particularly data-heavy site, but all
those links to other articles and external

Wikipedia to display the mobile site
used by phones and tablets rather than
the standard desktop version. All excess
content is stripped out to leave you with
just the main article, which is cleaner

is Zoom for Microsoft Edge (bit

reckons the extension cuts Wikipedia
loading times by more than half
without sacrificing important content.
Split Google results into
two columns
Is your monitor so wide that you get
a big empty area on the right of
results when you search Google?
Ours is, and we’re often left reflecting
on all that wasted browser space,
which is where 2-Column Google
Results comes in (bit.ly/2column423).
As its name suggests, this add-on
splits your Google search results into
twin columns, maximising available
space and saving you having to click
to scroll down to see more results.
Change the colour of your
scroll bars
If you’re bored of Firefox’s looks,
you can add a touch of class to the
browser using the fantastic add-on
NewScrollbars (bit.ly/scroll423). This
makes the dull rectangular scrollbars
down the right-hand side and along
the bottom of the window appear
much more appealing. You can
change their colour, width and shape,
render them transparent or remove
them altogether, with plenty of
customisation options to play around
with. It’s even possible to have a
different scrollbar style every day, to
make life really interesting!

AUDIO
CastBox

‘YouTube for audio’ is how
CastBox describes itself.
Irresistible shorthand,
but actually a bit of an
undersell. This free app,
new to Android after
several months on iOS
and Amazon Fire, is much
more than an audio-
streaming service. It’s also
a podcasting tool that lets
you download unlimited
numbers of files, drawing
from a library of millions
– including many of the
audiobooks, radio
channels and podcasts we mention in our cover
feature on page 38. You can play, bookmark and even
subscribe to content without creating an account.
In addition, it’s a radio-hosting tool that lets you record
and upload your own audio files for other users to stream
and download (see our Mini Workshop on the right).
CastBox offers all manner of ways to help you find an
audience, including an ‘advanced recommendation
algorithm’ that pushes your uploads to people with similar
interests. In turn, you get personalised recommendations,
trending lists and a superb search tool that offers one-tap
popular results and supports voice search. Unlike most
podcasting apps, CastBox is
completely free with no hidden
charges at all.
Sadly, the Android version
suffers a few bugs, notably with
downloads that refuse to play,
but CastBox says it’s working to
fix the problem. Streaming –
including continuous playback
and customised playlists –
worked perfectly when we
tried, although the app didn’t
seem to remember which items
we’d already played.
The audio-hosting element
of CastBox is a legal grey area
at best. The app places no limit
on the content you
upload, so there’s
obvious scope for
copyright infringement, just as with YouTube.
We’ll leave that one to the lawyers!

Android, iOS and Windows phones and tablets

Pocket Sense

4.0.3
Pickpockets love people
who keep their phones
in their trouser pockets.
They’re also fond of
people who charge their
devices in public.
To make yourself less
attractive to thieves,
enable one or more of
this app’s alarm modes:
Pocket Sense Mode,
which sounds an alarm
if someone grabs your
phone out of your pocket; Charge Sense Mode, which detects when
your device is unplugged; and Motion Sense Mode, which springs into
action when it’s moved. The only way to silence the alarm is to unlock
the phone. You wouldn’t want it enabled all the time, or you’d be
setting off alarms (Police Siren, Annoying Alarm or Nuke Alert – the
choice is yours) every time you pick up your phone. But it’s a quick
and easy way to set a security alarm while you’re standing in a crowd
or on public transport.

app didn’t meet
with universal
approval when
it launched.
We liked its
integration with Google Photos enough
to make it App Of The Fortnight in Issue
413 (bit.ly/webuser413), but had our
reservations about its glare-removal
feature, which automatically combines
shots to create one high-quality photo
scan. That mode is still set as the
default and although it produces great
results, we found it pointlessly fiddly
if all you need is a quick
document scan. So –
hooray! – you can now
disable glare removal with
one tap of the wand icon.

You can now record shows remotely

The big names are out in force this
fortnight, starting with Microsoft and
its successor to Wunderlist (www

2015. Wunderlist will be discontinued
soon, leaving 13 million users having
to switch to To-Do, and they’re not all
happy about it. To-Do lets you create
‘intelligent’ lists, notes and schedules
that sync across your devices, but
ditches certain Wunderlist features such
as shared lists, although we
found it quicker and easier
to use. Look out for a
comparison of to-do-list

The Learning Lock

If an Artful Dodger nicks your device,
a lock pattern locks them out. But
what if your thief knows (or guesses)
your pattern? The Learning Lock can
even lock out trespassers who know
you really well or have psychic skills.
This new app uses machine learning
to get accustomed to the way you
enter your pattern. If it detects that
someone else is having a go, it’ll
demand a backup PIN. It’s a great idea but the setup process
will test your patience: after wading through a
series of unnecessary permissions and the more
plausible ‘draw over other apps’ setting, you have
to set a background photo then enter your lock
pattern 10 times to ‘teach’ the app your style.

Eagle-eyed readers may wonder if
this issue is a Pictionary special. We
mention the classic drawing game on
page 47, and here it is again, this
time in the form of its first official
app. It looks fantastic and is fun to
play – but we’ve got a couple of big
criticisms. First, there’s no solo
mode. The best mobile games have
an option to play against the app,
but Pictionary requires that you play
against at least one other person, with a gallery
of real-life strangers to choose from. Worse, and
unforgivably, its in-app purchases climb to
£95.99 for ‘gems’. In a game that kids will love?
Its makers should be ashamed.

This customer has clearly nailed how to use
the Amazon Go app
36 17 - 30 May 2017
Amazon Go banishes queues, cash and checkouts from the shopping
experience. David Crookes explains how it works
Our guide to Amazon Go
What is it?
Amazon Go (bit.ly/amazongo423) is a
real-life grocery store that allows you to
walk in, take any item you want from the
shelves and then leave without passing
through a checkout. It sounds worryingly
akin to shoplifting, but the idea is that
you pay for your goods via an app on
your phone. This speeds up the shopping
process by eliminating queues and
freeing you from the usual faff of placing
your goods into a basket, taking them
out again to be scanned and repacking
them into shopping bags.
What does Amazon Go sell?
Anything from staples such as bread, milk
and cheese to drinks, easy-to-prepare
meals and treats such as pastries and
chocolates. The first Go store in Seattle
has been trading solely to Amazon
employees since December, with items
stocked in a 1,800ft2 (167m2) space. But
it’s still in a beta-testing phase and the
public opening – originally pencilled in
for the end of March – has been delayed.
Why does Amazon want a slice
of the grocery market?
Analysts are unsure why Amazon wants
to enter an industry in which many
established companies are making a loss.
They are just as baffled about why it
wants a bricks-and-mortar presence
when it has spent years undermining the
high street with its successful online
business. Yet the expansion of its brand
and desire to reach into all aspects of our
spending is hard for Amazon to resist.
How does Amazon Go work?
As a customer, the first thing you need
to do is install the free Amazon Go app,
which is linked with your Amazon
account. As you walk into the store,
you’ll be asked to open the app to call up
a QR code and hold your phone next to
a scanning device. This tells Amazon that
you are in the shop and ready to browse
the aisles. You can then grab items and
carry them or place them in your own
bag. Amazon works out what you’ve
taken and adds it to your virtual
shopping basket. Once you’ve walked
out of the store, it will create the overall
bill, debit your account and send you
a receipt.
What’s the technology behind it?
Amazon hasn’t divulged the exact
details of how it works out what you’re
buying. It does, however, say it uses
a combination of advanced machine
learning, computer vision and artificial
intelligence, similar to the tech found
in self-driving cars. As such, experts
suggest Amazon’s computers are
hooked up to a series of cameras around
the store. These make a note of two
things in particular: the items being
taken off the shelves and the person
doing the taking. This is a complicated
process since the system needs to
distinguish between a cheap bottle of
water and an expensive bottle of
Champagne, for example. But that’s
where AI and deep learning come into
play, looking for particular image
features and correcting errors so that
the right items at the correct prices
are added to your bill.
FAQ

interesting new technology trends and events

with Amazon Go, such as salad

OTHER QUEUE-CUTTING TECHNOLOGY
Discuss Amazon Go at forum.webuser.co.uk
Amazon Go
17 - 30 May 2017 37
But how does Go know it’s you
doing the buying?
Again, it is likely to be down to the
cameras. Presumably, Amazon Go is
using a system of facial recognition,
perhaps allied with a photographic scan
of your body and a study of the way
you move. This links you to your account
and allows you to be tracked as you walk
around the store and interact with the
items. In order to do this, your picture
would have to be taken multiple times
and on a continuous basis.
Would it know if I put something
back?
Yes. In fact, a video created to promote
Amazon Go (bit.ly/agvideo423)
highlights that very scenario. It shows
a customer removing a cheesecake
cupcake from the shelf and putting it
back. In doing so, the item is added to
the customer’s bill and then removed.
Amazon Go wants you to be oblivious to
the technology and just get on with your
shopping in the same way you would in
any supermarket or grocery store.
Self-scanning checkouts often
fail, so is this tech foolproof?
No, not at all. Just as we’ve all been
frustrated by items that don’t scan and
goods not registering in the bagging area
of self-service checkouts, so Amazon’s
developers have encountered problems
with Go. According to the Wall Street
Journal, the system currently struggles to
cope with more than 20 customers at
a time and it throws a wobbly if people
move too quickly. There are also issues
when items are moved from their usual
spot on the shelves and placed elsewhere.
So when will Amazon Go be
open to everyone?
It may be a while before Amazon is
entirely happy that its store is working in
the way it intends, and some sceptics in
the retail industry think the technology is
nowhere near ready yet. Mike McNamara,
the chief information and digital officer at
the American discount retailer Target,
thinks “we’re probably 14 years away!”.
Amazon hopes not, since it eventually
wants to have 2,000 Amazon Go stores
across America; it has yet to confirm
when UK shops will open.
What else is Amazon
considering for the high street?
It already has physical book shops called,
unsurprisingly, Amazon Books in cities
such as Chicago and New York, and these
may soon adopt the same Just Walk Out
shopping technology as Amazon Go. It is
also looking at creating drive-throughs
and larger 40,000ft2 (3,716m2) stores in
America as it continues its attempt to
revolutionise the high street in the same
way it has transformed online retail.
Won’t Amazon Go put shop
assistants out of work?
Any initiative which looks to replace
a role traditionally carried out by humans
is bound to be controversial and there
has already been talk of some customers
potentially boycotting such stores
in the future, should they become
commonplace. Yet there are academics
who argue that computer automation
creates job growth. James Bessen, an
economist at the Boston University
School of Law, says cutting checkout
queues makes shopping less stressful,
which could encourage people to shop
more frequently and buy more items.
This would then lead to more people
being employed in different, human-
reliant parts of the business.
Amazon will have an awful lot
of info about us, won’t it?
If you do a load of your shopping online
at Amazon.co.uk, then pop into its
Amazon Go and Amazon Books stores,
use Amazon Echo and watch lots of
content through Amazon Prime, to name
but a few of the giant’s services, then yes,
it will. But there seems to be no stopping
Amazon’s ambition as it continues to
reach its fingers into multiple pies.
Other retailers are also working
on ways of reducing queues and
waiting times
Scan as you shop
Some Tesco supermarkets offer a
portable scanner that you use to scan
barcodes of items as you shop. You can
then head to the till, pay, pack your
shopping and leave.
Using your mobile
A company called Diebold Nixdorf,
which provides self-service products
to retailers, is looking at ways for
customers to use their phones to scan
items as they shop. Sainsbury’s has
trialled a similar system called Mobile
Scan & Go.

Classic cartoons
From Popeye the Sailor and Felix
the Cat to Betty Boop and Mighty
Mouse, the Internet Archive has an
amazing array of classic cartoons from
the first half of the 20th century.
Download them for free (bit.ly/
cartoons423) in MPEG4 and Ogg Video
format, as well as (legal) torrent files.
Uck uck uck, indeed!

Stock footage
Want to spice up your home
movies by cutting in vintage clips of
sunrises, air battles and rattling old
automobiles? Then feast your eyes
on the Internet Archive’s fascinating
Stock Footage section (bit.ly/stock423),
which offers more than 1,600 copyright-
free clips for you to download and use
as you please.
12
Silent movies
They don’t make films like they
used to – without colour, sound and
CGI – and many silent movies are just
as impressive today as they were
100 years ago. At the Internet Archive
(bit.ly/silent423), you can download
many classics for free, including
The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, Nosferatu
and dozens of Charlie Chaplin shorts.
13
Classic TV shows
You don’t need to resort to
piracy or paying the high prices of the
BBC Store to download classic British
TV. The Internet Archive’s Classic TV
section (bit.ly/classictv423) has
thousands of programmes from the
Fifties and Sixties that you can save to
your PC or Mac for free. Most of the
content is American but there are lots of
BBC and ITV shows to download, too.
Highlights include Quatermass and the
Pit, The Army Game and episodes of
The Avengers, Emergency Ward 10
and Steptoe and Son
15
BBC iPlayer box sets
One annoyance with BBC iPlayer
is that if you catch the end of a series,
then go back to watch earlier episodes,
you often find they’ve disappeared
because of the 30-day streaming
download limit. The Beeb has addressed
this complaint by making some series
available as box sets, in which every
instalment is available simultaneously
for at least one month. Recent box-set
downloads include Peter Kay’s Car
Share and the Tom Hardy drama Taboo,
while the current series of Doctor Who
will be available for three months.
16
Channel 4 programmes
To download ITV shows, you
need to pay £3.99 per month for its ITV
Hub+ subscription service, but Channel
4’s All 4 hub (bit.ly/all4423) gives you
both catch-up and archive content for
free. Downloads are only available via
the Android and iOS apps, and you
need to put up with ads before and
during programmes, but Chromecast
compatibility means you can stream
downloads to your TV. Box sets include
the complete series of Father Ted,
The IT Crowd and Shameless.
17
YouTube videos in Window
10
Considering that you’re not really
supposed to download videos from
YouTube, there are a surprising number
of downloaders for the video-sharing
site in the Windows 10 app store. Our
favourite is Hyper for YouTube (bit.ly/
hyper423), which makes it easy to
search, play and download videos, so
you can watch them whenever you want.
14
Netflix TV shows & films
Netflix once said that it had no plans to let
its users download content as well as stream it,
so we were delighted when it changed its mind
at the end of last year. Not only can you now
save many TV shows and films to your Android
or iOS phone or tablet to watch offline whenever
you want, but you can even store them on your
SD card so they don’t use up valuable space.
Last month, Netflix expanded its download
capabilities further by letting you save videos to view offline in its Windows 10
app (bit.ly/netflix423), in both standard and high quality. Naturally, there are a
few limitations – not all Netflix titles are available to download, and the files
expire after 30 days – but it’s still a very welcome addition.

The days of novelty ringtones
such as Crazy Frog are thankfully long
gone, but many people still like to make
their calls sound more exciting with
a personalised tune. To cut through the
minefield of dodgy sources, head to
Zedge (www.zedge.net), where you’ll
find thousands of free, good quality

Free songs from iTunes
Apple used to give away a free
song on iTunes every week, but quietly
dropped the ‘Single of the Week’
promotion two years ago when it moved
its focus to its streaming service Apple

Many musicians, DJs and

What we liked:
Based on Google Chrome,
Epic Browser is
a fast browser
built for
everyday use
hat offers the
perfect combination
of privacy features and
usability. The private-
browsing mode that you find
in most browsers is always
switched on in Epic, so it
deletes your browsing data
(cookies, history and login
data) whenever you close it.
Epic also offers
comprehensive built-in ad
and tracker blocking, notifying
you of how many trackers it’s blocked
on a particular website and even
showing you who is tracking you
in other browsers.
Epic tackles a range of known privacy
vulnerabilities that other browsers often
overlook, such as installation tracking,
and address-bar and URL tracking.
It also protects against ‘fingerprinting’,
a method of tracking that can be used
by your ISP even when you use a VPN.
Searches are anonymous, too: whenever
you use a major search engine, the
browser automatically directs your
searches through a proxy
so no association is made
with your IP address.
Epic is set by default
to request encrypted
connections but when you need to
guarantee a secure connection, you
can manually enable its proxy to
hide your IP address and encrypt
your browsing. Like using a VPN,
this protects you when you’re using
public Wi-Fi networks and you can
also use it to access content that’s
blocked in particular regions.
One standout feature not related to
privacy is the option to download audio
and video from sites such as YouTube,
Facebook, Vimeo and SoundCloud.
For convenience, Epic lets you import
bookmarks from other browsers, and
OUR VERDICT
If you want to replace your
everyday browser with one that
takes your privacy much more
seriously, Epic Browser is perfect
for the job. It’s fast, easy to use and
offers all the tools you need to stay
anonymous online.

it’s proxy tool doesn’t protect your
anonymity with the same
sophistication that Tor Browser does.

Private browsers
17 - 30 May 2017 51
Discuss private browsers at forum.webuser.co.uk
What we liked:
Tor Browser is a modified
version of Firefox that
protects your identity
by directing all your
traffic via a network of
housands of volunteers.
First developed by the US
Navy to protect government
communications, it’s incredibly secure
– but you don’t have to be an IT expert
to use it. When opened, the browser
automatically launches the necessary
processes to route your traffic through
the Tor network. It then further protects
your privacy using the NoScript and
HTTPS Everywhere add-ons, which
block all malicious scripts and ensure
encrypted connections are made
wherever possible. From Tor Browser’s
security settings, you can use the slider
to choose a security level that best suits
you. In the highest position, Javascript
and some fonts, images and HTML-5
elements are blocked to offer maximum
protection. Tor can be run as a portable
app from a USB memory stick and,
like Epic Browser, it deletes all your
browsing data as soon as it’s closed.
What we liked:
Opera doesn’t specialise in
privacy in the way our
other award winners do,
but its recent introduction
of an unlimited VPN makes
an excellent choice for
anyone who wants to hide
their IP address and browse
anonymously at the click of a button.
After enabling the VPN from Opera’s
Settings menu, it can be switched off
and on from the address bar, and you
can choose from five different virtual
locations. The browser comes with a
built-in ad blocker and you can also set
it to send a ‘Do not track’ request to
websites for times when you’re not
using the VPN.
Like our other award winners, Opera
has a private-browsing mode that clears
all your browsing data when it’s closed.
However, because this isn’t enabled by
default, you can choose to reap the
performance benefits of saving
browsing data such as cookies and web
history, and enable private browsing
only when you need it.
How it can be improved:
Opera doesn’t block trackers as
comprehensively as Epic Browser unless
you’re using the VPN. Because the
private-browsing features aren’t
‘always-on’, there’s always a risk you’ll
forget to enable them.
How it can be improved:
Because your traffic is always routed
around a network of other computers,
Tor Browser is noticeably slower than
our Gold Award winner. With no option
to save login credentials, it’s also less
convenient than Epic Browser.
OUR VERDICT
Tor Browser is arguably the most
powerful tool for maintaining your
anonymity online. However, we’d
recommend it only as a secondary
browser (rather than a replacement
for your everyday browser) because
of its slower performance.
OUR VERDICT
If you want a browser that’s good
for any web activity, Opera comes
highly recommended. Its VPN and
private browsing provide total
anonymity online when required,
but it also offers all the powerful
tools you’d expect from a modern
browser.
Avira Scout
bit.ly/avira423
Avira Scout protects your privacy
online in a number of ways,
including blocking phishing
websites, forcing the secure HTTPS
protocol wherever possible and
blocking
trackers on
Facebook and
Twitter. Like
our Gold and
Silver award
winners, it also
promises not
to collect any data about you.
However, it lacks the tools to offer
the same level of online anonymity
as our award winners.
Dooble
dooble.sourceforge.net
Dooble is an open-source browser
that has many innovative tools to
protect your privacy. Along with
a private-
browsing
mode, which
can be
enabled on a
tab-by-tab
basis (rather
than having to
open a new
window), it lets you password-
protect and encrypt all the
browsing data you save on your PC.
However, there’s no built-in option
to obtain total online anonymity via
a VPN or proxy.
Comodo Dragon (Chrome)/
IceDragon (Firefox)
bit.ly/comodo423
Based on Chrome and Firefox
respectively, Comodo Dragon and
IceDragon offer all the features of
those browsers plus a range of
further tools to protect your
security and privacy. The browsers
enforce secure connections where
possible and block some trackers,
but if you’re more concerned about
privacy than security, you’re better
off with one of our award winners.

hen you spend as much time on the web
as we do at Web User, you end up with a
long list of bookmarked websites that you
go back to time and time again. But it’s frustrating
when you check back to a website only to find that
it hasn’t updated since your last visit or that none of
its latest articles interest you.
Feedly saves you wasting time by letting you skim
through headlines and summaries of the latest posts
on all your favourite sites, quickly and easily, in one
place. It also has a new tool called Boards, which
works alongside its existing Read It Later tool,
organising the articles you want to view at your
convenience into useful lists.
Feedly: feedly.com |
20 mins | Any browser
Andy Shaw says
The basic version of Feedly is free but
a Pro account costs around £4.20 per
month. The free version restricts you to
100 feed sources, but that should be
plenty for most people. It also limits
you to three boards, so you need to be
disciplined about how you use them.
We organised our boards by
environment, storing articles of interest
in separate lists for reading at home,
at work and on the train.

Use the star icon to save a story to a board. You can either
hover over a story in the list view and click the star 1
or click a story to read the preview, in which case the star
icon appears in the row of tools above it. The first time you
use a board, you’ll need to click the ‘Create your first board’
button. 2
6
Type the name that you want to give to the board into
the box and click the Create button. When you click the
star icon from now on, you can add a link to an existing
board by clicking its Save button 1 or click ‘Create a board’ 2
again to make a new category.
7
By default, clicking a headline to read more of a story will
mark it as read. This displays the headline in grey so you
can see at a glance that you’ve viewed it. You can also
mark something without opening it by using the tick icon. 1
The cross 2 marks an item as read and hides it, so you won’t
see it again.
8
For maximum efficiency when ploughing through long
lists of unread material, we changed the defaults to mark
anything as read as soon as we scroll past it, to save us
from having to click the ticks or crosses. To do this, click your
account icon 1 and choose Preferences, 2 then click the ‘Mark
as read’ button. 3
10
If you’ve discovered an interesting article outside
Feedly, you can still add it to one of your boards.
Copy the URL of the article and open Feedly. Select
the board from the menu, 1 then click the star icon. 2 Paste
the address of the page into the URL box, 3 wait for the
preview to load, then click ‘Save to board’. 4
9
Turn off Confirm Mark As Read 1 to make browsing
through articles much faster. Also, under Auto-Mark As
Read On Scroll, choose All Views. 2 This activates the
scrolling ‘mark as read’ setting. Scroll down and you can also
configure keyboard shortcuts and activate the option to click
on the unread number icon to mark an entire group as read.

1
Record a short video using
your device’s camera.
It makes things easier
if you can keep your camera
steady, either by resting it on
something or using a tripod
designed for mobile devices.
Keep it below five seconds
if you can. Open the MaskArt
app and select your video. 1
You can use other videos that
you haven’t shot specifically
for the purpose but planning
ahead will help you later.
2
If the video is longer than
five seconds, drag the left
or right side of the
timeline 1 toward the middle
to make it the correct length. If
you wish, you can tap, hold and
drag the highlighted section 2
to move it forwards and back
along the timeline to use a
different section of the video.
3
Tap the brush icon 1 and
you’ll see a purple mask
applied to the whole
image. 2 With your finger,
erase the mask around the
section you want to animate, 3
making sure it opens up the
area of movement on all the
frames you want to use. This
can be a bit fiddly but you can
lift your finger, see how you’re
getting on, then erase a little
more. If you go too far, tap the
eraser icon 4 to draw the mask
back in.
4
If you want to use a
different frame – or even
a different video or photo
– as the still image that the
moving element appears over,
tap the Select Photo button.
Choose a frame from the
timeline 1 or an image from
the Gallery below it. 2 You can
also move the image around
by tapping the Move button.
Start again at any time by
tapping Back.
5
When you’ve finished
tweaking, tap Next.
With MaskArt, you can
choose to create a video, 1
an animated GIF 2 or a Live
Photo 3 (the latter only works
on Apple devices). Preview your
chosen option and tap Next 4
to create it. If you’ve chosen to
create a GIF, you’ll get the
option to export it.
6
You can tweak an animated GIF by uploading it to a tool
such as LunaPic (www.lunapic.com). Crop it to shape
from the Edit menu 1 and control the animation by
clicking Animation, 2 then Edit Gif Animation. You can choose
the speed at which you want the frames to play and whether
you’d like the animation to loop. 3
Create a cinemagraphic moving photo
A
cinemagraph is a still image with a single
moving element – halfway between a photo
and a video – which gives a standard picture
an amazing animated quality. You can make one using
your mobile device. Here, we’ve used MaskArt on an
iPhone but if you have an Android device, try
Cinegraph (bit.ly/cine423). The steps are a bit
different but the final result should be just as good.

Manage Chrome add-ons for a faster browser
A
dd-ons bring useful tools to Chrome and enhance your
enjoyment of the web, but having too many can
overload your browser and slow it down. It may seem
self-defeating to add yet another extension to tackle this
problem, but Context sorts your
add-ons into groups, so you can just
activate the ones you need for a
particular task, quickly and efficiently.

Install Context and the add-on’s Options page will load
in a new tab. The main list shows all your available
add-ons. 1 First, drag and drop the add-ons that you
always want to be available to the section marked ‘Always-
enabled extensions’. 2
2
Click New Context and choose a name 1 and icon 2
for your first collection. If you’d prefer the group to use
the icon of the first add-on, tick the box. 3 Click Create
and repeat this process as necessary, then drag and drop
your add-ons to the different groups and click Save.
3
An add-on can be placed in more than one group.
When you install a new add-on, Context displays a
pop-up where you can choose which groups to add
it to. To enable a group, open a new tab, select Context’s
icon 1 in your toolbar and click the appropriate button. 2 4
To enable multiple groups at once, click their respective
‘+’ buttons 1 (the ‘-’ button disables them). A green
bar is displayed 2 when a group is enabled. Click ‘All
extensions’ 3 to enable all your add-ons. Click the right
arrow 4 to view all the add-ons in a group.
5
When viewing the add-ons in a group, you can
select individual ones to enable or disable them. 1
The group’s icon turns orange to show that some but
not all of its add-ons are active. Right-click Context’s icon in
the toolbar to open its Options menu.

Click ‘Additional options’ 1 and tick the box to make
Context support apps as well as add-ons. 2 The
‘Configuration import/export/sync’ menu 3 lets you
save your configuration to the server, so you can sync it to

Get to grips with some serious PC DIY to boost
your computer’s performance
How to...
Control your Windows PC
with your voice
Why use a keyboard and mouse when you could simply tell your PC
what you want it to do? Wayne Williams shows you how
I
t’s been possible to control your PC
using voice-recognition software for
many years now, yet opening a program
or shutting down your computer simply by
speaking a few simple commands – rather
than using a keyboard and mouse –
still seems a bit sci-fi. In fact, the only
difficulty, once it’s all set up, is getting into
the habit of telling your PC what you want
to do, rather than using your hands to
press keys or click buttons. That said,
if you’re already using a voice assistant
on your phone, such as Siri or Google Now,
or you own a device like the Amazon Echo,
you’ll already be used to controlling
hardware with spoken commands.

play and composing and sending emails
– all using just your voice.
The Creators Update introduced
additional features to Cortana including
the ability to lock your PC, and raise and
lower the volume. The digital assistant
is also supposed to be able to turn off,
restart or send your PC to sleep,
although these options don’t currently
work on our updated PCs. Presumably
Talk to Cortana
If you’re running Windows 10, then you
already have tools for controlling your
PC with your voice. Cortana, which
began life on Windows phones, debuted
in the first build of Windows 10 and has
become increasingly more powerful in
each major update of the operating
system. You can ask her to perform
various tasks, such as opening apps,
searching the web, performing

they’ll be added in a future update.
If you ask Cortana to do one
of the unsupported tasks (“Cortana,
shut down my PC”) she will provide
information on how to do it manually.
A new feature introduced in the
Anniversary Update was a full-screen
option for Cortana on the Lock screen,
which let you ask questions or set new
reminders without having to unlock your
device first. The Creators Update
expands this to the Desktop. If your
PC is unlocked and has been idle for
a while, you can say, “Hey, Cortana” and
it will open in full-screen mode, allowing

To get started, make sure you have
a microphone connected or
enabled, then click the Cortana/Search
button on the taskbar. 1 Click the
Settings button 2 and set ‘Hey
Cortana’ to On. 3 Under Microphone,
click the ‘Get started’ link 4 to
configure things and make sure
Cortana can hear you.
2
The ‘Set up your microphone’ app
loads. Click ‘Set up the mic’ 1 and
a new window opens. Click Next, then
read the sentences displayed on screen.
Assuming everything is working
correctly, your microphone will be set up
and you’re ready to begin using Cortana
to control your computer.

To use voice control, say “Hey,
Cortana”. A box appears informing
you that Cortana is listening, along
with a suggestion to use the feature
to send an email. 1 You can do that
or try something different, such as
“Open Settings”, “Launch Chrome”
or “Raise volume.”
the Creators Update (the roll-out is
ongoing and will take a while to reach
older, potentially less compatible PCs)
and you try to use a voice command
that’s not available – such as asking
Cortana to raise or lower the volume
– you’ll see a message stating: “Sorry,
I can’t do this for you right now. Check
back again after future updates.”
We show you how to get started with
Cortana in our Mini Workshop, below.
Set up Windows 10 with
Cortana
One of the features introduced in the
Creators Update is a new tool that lets
you use Cortana to set up the operating
system exactly how you want it on
a new device or following a reinstall.
If you agree to this, Cortana will ask you
a series of yes/no questions during
setup that you can respond to using
your voice (provided you have a working
microphone).
If you’re not sure about something,
you can ask Cortana for help.

Install and run Agnitio. It will open
above the notification area and
display a list of commands sorted into
categories – Web Browsers, System,
Website, Search Engines and Extra. 1
Click the plus sign next to a category
to display the commands you can use.
Speak any of these commands and
Agnitio will perform that task.
2
Configure the software by clicking
the Settings tab at the top of the
program window. 1 If you plan to use
Agnitio all the time, tick the option
to ‘Run at Windows Startup’. 2 It should
be running in Training Mode, 3
which means it will ‘learn’ and improve
over time.

You can check for program updates
1 and switch between light and
dark themes (this requires a restart). 2
Agnitio will speak to you to confirm
certain tasks (such as logging off),
and you can switch between a female

this change will also require a restart.
MINI WORKSHOP | Control your PC using Agnitio
Get more tools with Agnitio
While Cortana provides you with some
control over your computer, there are
alternatives that offer even more.
One example is Agnitio (bit.ly/agni423),
a tiny (426KB) but powerful voice-
recognition tool. Unlike Cortana, it can
shut down, restart and log off your PC,
and also run programs and system tools
such as Notepad, Command Prompt,
Disk Cleanup and Event Viewer.
Agnitio can also launch popular
browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera,
Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer),
and you can use it to perform voice-
based web searches, check your email
and launch video websites.
Agnitio is a very new program – the
first version was only released in March
and, at the time of writing, is still in beta
– so there are some limitations to be
aware of. For example, you currently
can’t add custom commands to it,
so you’re stuck with only the ones
it already supports. Hopefully, this will
change in a future release. Also, it can
only open programs – it isn’t able to
close them afterwards.
On the plus side, Agnitio is lightweight,
so it won’t slow down your PC, and we
found it does a good job of recognising
voice commands from the moment it’s
installed. However, we found it a bit too
sensitive at times – opening browser
tabs and trying to perform tasks such as
shutting down the PC without being
asked. Adjusting the microphone
sensitivity reduced this problem, but it’s
something to be aware of.
We show you how to use Agnitio
in our Mini Workshop, below.
Control software with GAVPI
Another option you could consider is the
open-source GAVPI (bit.ly/gavp423),
which uses voice-command macro
software. It lets you bind voice
commands to a set of actions (key
presses, mouse clicks) and you can
create separate profiles for different
games and applications. You don’t have
to install the program – just download
and run it – then create an ‘action
sequence’ (a collection of mouse and/or
keyboard actions) along with a phrase
trigger that will launch it.
You can save profiles, edit them in any
text editor and load profiles created by
other users.

Microsoft
products...’.
In Windows 7, go
to Windows Update
in the Control Panel
and check for
updates. Look for
optional updates,
select them all
and update.
Open Device
Manager in the
Control Panel.
Expand each section, select each item
and click ‘Update driver’. It is a tedious
process so you might want to use a tool
that does it for you, such as IObit Driver
Booster Free (bit.ly/iodbf423). Update
one driver and test your PC. If it is
working fine, update the next one.
Reduce Windows’ waiting
time
Shutting down your computer is a
complicated procedure because there
may be applications that are running,
open windows on the Desktop, hidden
programs and services working in the
background, and so on.
When you click Start, Power, ‘Shut
down’, Windows sends a message to
everything that is running, telling it to
close. The software should respond
to the call, so the computer knows it’s
received the message, and Windows
then gives the software 20 seconds to
close before it starts shutting itself
I
n Windows 10, when you click Start,
Power, ‘Shut down’, the PC doesn’t
actually shut down – instead, it logs you
off and hibernates. This saves the PC’s
current state to the hard drive so it can be
reloaded quickly when the PC is restarted.
It’s fast, but it can cause problems in some
circumstances. To properly shut down the
computer, click Start, Power and hold
down Shift when you click ‘Shut down’.
To make Windows always shut down
fully without having to hold down the Shift
key, right-click the battery or power icon in
the taskbar (which one you have depends
on whether it’s a laptop or desktop PC)
and select ‘Power options’. Click ‘Choose
what the power buttons do’, then click
‘Change settings that are currently
unavailable’ and clear the tick against
‘Turn on fast startup’. Save the changes
and see if it improves the reliability of
your Windows shutdown and startup.
Force a real shutdown in Windows 10
Update everything
Incompatible or buggy programs,
services and drivers are usually the
cause of shutdown problems. These
most commonly occur after a Windows
upgrade – everything was working fine
but, since upgrading, the PC becomes
dogged by problems.
The solution is to upgrade everything,
starting with Windows. Although core
Windows files are updated
automatically, there are optional
updates that could fix shutdown
problems. Press Windows+i in Windows
10 and click ‘Update and Security’.
Select Windows Update and Advanced
options, then tick the box ‘Give me

TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL
More advanced tips for when you’re feeling brave
down. A fast new computer with very
little installed on it may not need this
long. You can speed up shutdown by
reducing the time allowed for programs
to close.
Press Windows+R and type regedit
then press Enter to open the Registry
Editor. Navigate to:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control
Panel\Desktop
Find WaitToKillAppTimeout in the
right-hand pane. If it’s not there, click
Edit, New, String Value and name the
new item WaitToKillAppTimeout,
then double-click it. The default value is
20000 (milliseconds, or 20 seconds),
so replace it with a lower number such
as 15000 (15 seconds). If your PC has
a solid-state drive installed, then 10000
(10 seconds) is probably enough,
because SSDs are much faster than
mechanical hard drives.
Deal with hung apps sooner
When a program is told to close,
Windows gives it five seconds to
respond. If it takes longer, then a
message appears on the screen saying
that the process did not respond. There
is then an option to force it to close. The
length of this period is set by another
Registry setting – HungAppTimeout.
To change this setting, open the
Registry Editor as above and go to:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control
Panel\Desktop
As before, if HungAppTimeout is not
listed on the right, click Edit, New,
‘String value’. Name it HungAppTimeout
and double-click it. The default value is
5000 (5 seconds). Reduce the time to
4000 for old or slow PCs or 3000 for
a fast new computer.
Unresponsive programs are given less
time than programs that have
responded and are getting on with
shutting down. This is so that you can
start dealing with them sooner.
Shut down hung apps
automatically
If you always want to force a hung app
to shut down, you can set this to happen
automatically. Open the Registry Editor
and go to:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control
Panel\Desktop
Look for AutoEndTasks and, if you
can’t see it, click Edit, New, ‘String value’
and name it AutoEndTasks. Double-
click it and set it to 1 to let Windows
automatically force the app to close
(if you would still rather be asked about
forcing programs to close, set it to 0).
This makes shutdown faster because
Windows automatically deals with apps
that won’t close.
the contents of the page file when
Windows shuts down. However, this
means that the PC takes longer to
power off or restart. Ultimately, the
choice is between speed and security.
To change the option, press
Windows+R, type secpol.msc and
press Enter. Expand Local Policies and
select Security Options. Scroll down
the list on the right and find
‘Shutdown: Clear virtual memory
pagefile’. Double-click it and either
enable it to prioritise security or
disable it to maximise speed.
If you don’t have the Local Security
Policy tool, press Windows+R, type
regedit and press Enter. In the
left-hand pane select:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\
CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
Manager\Memory Management
Double-click
ClearPageFileAtShutdown and set it
to 0 for speed or 1 for security.
Kill services sooner
Programs don’t always display
windows – some run invisibly in the
background. When Windows shuts
down, the services that are running
must also be stopped. As with
standard programs, they’re given
a certain length of time and, if they
don’t respond, a message is displayed
on the screen and you can force them
to stop. WaitToKillServiceTimeout
is like the WaitToKillAppTimeout we
saw earlier. Launch the Registry
Editor and go to:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\
CurrentControlSet\Control
On the right, double-click
WaitToKillServiceTimeout. The default
value should be 20000 (20 seconds)
according to Microsoft, but a
Windows 10 PC we looked at had this
set to 5000 (5 seconds). If yours is set
to 20000, try 15000 or 10000 to
make Windows respond more quickly
to services that are stuck when your
PC is trying to shut down.
Check the event logs
Windows keeps a log of everything
that happens on your PC from when
it starts to when it shuts down. This
huge store of info includes startup
and shutdown events.
Press Windows+R, type eventvwr
and press Enter. Windows 10 users can
access the log by right-clicking the
Start button. In the left pane, expand
‘Applications and Services Logs’,
Microsoft, Windows, Diagnostics-
Performance and select Operational.
In the middle pane at the top is a list
of events that Windows has recorded.
There may be a lot, so you should
sort the events by clicking the Event
ID column header. Shutdown events
have IDs starting at 200 and you may
see warnings, errors and critical items.
Select each one and look in the
preview pane below for clues as to
what the event is about. Programs or
services that hang or otherwise take
too long to shut down are listed here.
Restart Windows, immediately
return to Event Viewer and click the
‘Date and Time’ column header to sort
the events by date. Scroll down past
the startup events to see the
shutdown events and any problems
detected. If a particular program or
driver is causing problems, try to find
an updated version.
Tweak page file options
When Windows is short of memory,
it temporarily stores information in
a special file on the hard drive called
the page file. This is a permanent file
on the drive and is a potential security
problem because the information it
contains could be private, personal or
something you wouldn’t want made
public. In theory, someone could
access the contents of the page file
and recreate the files it stores.
For this reason, and to protect your
security, there is an option to erase
Check the event logs for problems
detected during shutdown
Don’t clear the page file if you want
to shut down quickly

Reset Sky Go
Q
About six months ago, my Toshiba
laptop started showing an error
message (number 6030) when I tried
to use Sky Go with Windows 8.1. My usual
repair shop couldn’t fix it and when
I contacted Microsoft’s web chat,
they said the problem was with Sky.
Predictably, when I contacted Sky, they
said it was Microsoft’s problem. Friends
have suggested uninstalling Silverlight
and installing an older version, but that
idea seems a bit iffy.

EMAIL
Email private files
Q
I need to send Excel spreadsheets to
friends and colleagues, and some of
them contain confidential information.
Is it safe to send them by email or could
they be intercepted and spied on? I’d
hate them to fall into the wrong hands.
Should I encrypt the Excel files or use
Winzip to compress them with a
password? I know encryption software
is available but it can be expensive. I’ve
heard that some versions of Windows
can encrypt files, but mine doesn’t.
I’m using Windows 7 Home Premium,
Windows Live Mail and Microsoft Office
2010. Is there anything else I can do to
make these emails as secure as possible?
Nicolas Lindsey, via email
A
Some email providers offer very
secure messaging, but others don’t,
so it’s possible that your emails could be
intercepted and read. Some secure
email services are only secure if both
the sender and recipient are using it.
Otherwise the recipient may need to
enter usernames and passwords,
confirm their identity and so on, which
can be irritating.
Virtru (bit.ly/virt423) is a free Chrome
extension that lets you send secure and
encrypted emails using Gmail and
Outlook. ProtonMail (protonmail.com)
is a free secure email provider.
An alternative to sending a file in an
email is to share it online. If you have a
Google account, for example, you can
put the file on Google Drive, right-click
it and select Share. You then invite
people to access it by entering their
email address. It’s useful for sharing files
between Google users.
You could also encrypt files with a
password. EncryptOnClick (bit.ly/
encr423) uses 256-bit AES encryption,
which is one of the most secure
methods available. The recipient will
need EncryptOnClick to decrypt it,
and you need to agree on a password
beforehand. Alternatively, you could try
following our Workshop on Hyper Crypt
(hypercrypt.azurewebsites.net) in Issue
418 (bit.ly/webuser418).
Q
I’m using a rather old external
hard drive to store my collection
of irreplaceable photos and videos.
How reliable are these hard drives
compared with online storage sites?
Garry Owen, via email
A
Whatever you’re doing, stop right
now and make a backup.
It doesn’t matter whether your
irreplaceable photos and videos are
online or offline – if they’re only in one
place, they’re at serious risk. If your
hard drive fails, you’ll lose everything.
The ideal situation is to use both
online and offline storage. Fire, flood,
theft or mechanical failure could ruin
an external hard drive, but you’re safe
if you also have online backup.
All hard drives fail eventually and
when the one with all your photos and
videos on it stops working, you’ll lose
everything it contains. To be safe,
replace it every five years or so,
depending on how hard it’s used.
The drives used by online-storage
services can also fail, but their
systems are designed to protect data
by replicating it across multiple drives.
If one fails, it can be replaced with
a new drive without loss of data.
Online-storage providers are good
at backing up data, so their services
are more reliable than the hard drive
in your PC. Security is an issue,
however: last year Dropbox lost
details of 68 million user accounts
to hackers. This could also block
access to your online storage.
Double up
your backup

Online storage is mostly failure-proof

Upgrades are not updates
Q
In Best Free Software, Issue 420

Stop startup pop-ups
Q
Since updating my Windows 10 PC,

Anne Ellis, via email

English is written from left to
right, but some languages are
written from right to left. Windows
and Chrome can do both. You may
be accidentally switching from one
language to another.
Some people have found that a
mouse fault switched this at random.
Others were accidentally pressing
Ctrl+Shift or Alt+Shift and switching
direction that way. Those shortcuts
didn’t work for us, but try them next
time your text appears backwards to
see if it corrects the problem.
Stop your PC

GENERAL PC
If text is appearing backwards, you
may have switched languages
probably because it switches to using
a Microsoft driver. These drivers, which
are available for almost every hardware
component, won’t be the fastest or
most feature-packed but they prioritise
stability and compatibility above all
else. So if Microsoft’s driver works and
you’re happy with it, stick with it.
To check that you have the latest
Microsoft driver, open Device Manager
in the Control Panel. Expand ‘Display
adapters’ then right-click the graphics
card and select ‘Update driver’.
AD-BLOCKING
Stop sites blocking blockers
Q
Using ad-blocking software has
become a pain. Many websites can
now detect when you’re using one and
stop their pages loading in your browser.
They say they need the revenue to keep
the site running and require you to
switch off the ad blocker before you can
download the page. Are there any
workarounds for this?
Hardik Upadhyay, via email
A
This arms race between ad blockers
and websites has been going on for
some time and will probably only get
worse as websites use increasingly
sophisticated detection and ad blockers
launch tools to get around it.
The problem is that many websites
depend on advertising and if you take
away their ad revenue, they have no
option but to close. Some big sites have
already closed and more will follow.
The best thing you can do is to avoid
websites with excessive advertising and
tell them why you won’t use them any
more. Falling visitor numbers will force
sites to cut back on annoying ads.

TOP TIP
I recently returned from a holiday with
friends and we all wanted to share our
photos with each other, so I suggested
we used Google Photos. Most people
already have a Google account and the
app comes as standard on most
Android devices (iOS users can install
it from bit.ly/photos423), so it doesn’t
take long to start sharing. What’s more,
by creating a shared album, you can
view all your photos in one
chronological timeline, which tells a
much better story of the holiday.
To create a shared album, tap the
three-dot button on the Albums page
and select ‘Shared album’. Choose one
or more pictures that you want to
include (you can easily add more
later), then tap Next. You’ll be invited
to give the album a name, then tap
Share and ‘Get link’ to copy the
shareable link to your clipboard.
You can copy this link to any app to
share it with friends and family.
To allow others to add their own
photos to the album, tap the three-dot
button and select ‘Sharing options’,
Collate photos from a group event
PHOTOS
then ensure Collaborate is switched on.
Whenever someone joins the album,
you’ll be able to see their name on this
page and you’ll also be notified by the
Google Photos Assistant. When others
add photos, you can see them instantly
in the album. Tapping the cloud icon
for a specific image lets you add it to
your own library.
One caveat is that shared albums
can be viewed by anyone who has the
link, so don’t upload any images you’d
prefer to keep private.

Create program folders on
your Start menu
I just installed the Windows 10 Creators
Update and found a useful new feature
on the Start menu. Like the home screen
of a mobile phone, you can drag one tile
and drop it on another to create a folder
that contains both items. After creating
the folder, you can drag other tiles to it.
There seems to be space for up to nine
Start tiles in each folder.
The way it works is a bit confusing
because when you drop one tile on
another, it appears to do nothing. You’ll
see two horizontal lines and your two
tiles between them. Above is a blank tile
with an up arrow. Click it to shrink or
expand the tile folder.
The folders can be used to organise
the Start tiles so you don’t have to scroll
if you have a lot, or you could use it to
group similar programs together.

sterling service, I can no longer use
BetterPrivacy (bit.ly/betterprivacy423).
Fortunately, there’s a way to get it
working again. Type about:config into

Take notes without touching
your phone
Did you know that you can dictate notes
to Google Keep using the ‘Ok Google’
voice command? Simply say “OK
Google”, then say “Take a note with
Google Keep” and it’ll ask you what you
want to note down. Speak the contents
of your note and your words will appear
on screen. Your phone saves the note
and you can then tap ‘View notes’ to see
it in the app.
I find this particularly handy for making
notes when I’m sitting in traffic, because
handling a phone when driving now
comes with the risk of a £200 fine and
six points on your driving licence.
You can also use the voice assistant to
create a list. Just say “Create list”, then
say the items you want to add to it.
You can use the words ‘add’, ‘remove’
and ‘change’ to manipulate items in
the list. When you’re happy with the list,
say “Save list”. Note that if you pause
for a while, you might need to say
“Ok Google” again for it to start listening.

I use Excel for keeping a record of my
various bank accounts and I update my
worksheets regularly from the
appropriate online banking websites.
Sometimes the data is available to
download in a compatible CSV format,
but for others I have to copy from the
web page and paste as ‘unicode text’
to preserve the columns.
After doing this, I occasionally found
that the sheet gave an inaccurate
balance that did not correspond with
the true balance for that account.
Following much head-scratching,
I discovered that while copying the
unicode text across to the spreadsheet,
the ‘£’ symbol was also being entered
into the columns formatted as
‘currency.’ The amounts entered
appeared correct and looked exactly
the same as all the previous entries in
these columns, which all displayed the
expected ‘£’ symbol.
It was only by chance, as I was
selecting cells in these rows, that
I noticed the corresponding values in
Stop Excel giving incorrect SUM value
SOFTWARE
the formula box occasionally displayed
the ‘£’ symbol, whereas most other
entries only showed the numerical
value. This extraneous ‘£’ was causing
the errors when trying to calculate the

so I used the Edit/Replace function
to strip them out.
I now make sure to strip out all these
extra symbols after pasting in any
additional transactions.

After installing Creators Update,

Q
I’ve tried to install Creators Update

easiest way to install the Creators
Update without losing all my files?
johnfreeman, Web User Forums
A
Be patient. Although it might look
as if the installation is stuck, updates
sometimes take a very long time to
progress to the next stage and can even
require multiple restarts. Interrupting it
will only cause problems, so give it plenty
of time and see if it eventually finishes
on its own. If you use antivirus software,
try disabling that while you’re updating.
If you still have no luck after leaving
the installation running for several hours,
try resetting your PC. Note that you can
copy personal files to an external hard
drive and copy them back afterwards,

So disappointed by the
Creators Update
Well after all the hype, and
following months of
waiting and reading about
it, the widely acclaimed
Windows 10 Creators
Update is here and I have
to admit it has landed on
my computer like a damp
squib. I just don’t see what
all the high expectations have been
about. Let’s look at Web User’s
breakdown of new features:
• Paint 3D
If you are into this sort of thing, then
ﬁne – but really?
• Night Light
What an absolute load of rubbish.
• Better controls for Windows Update
The update feature has never been
a problem for me and I think too many
moaners just moan for the sake of
moaning.
• Improved privacy controls
This has never really bothered me,
but some people have nothing better
to do than whinge.
• Better tab management
This is pointless because when you
open a tab you have saved, it
disappears from the saved tabs anyway.
• Do more with Cortana
The less said here the better. Who the
hell wants to talk to their computer?
• Buy and read ebooks
Ah, at last something useful – if you are
into reading.
• Free up space automatically
Well, a small plus here but nothing we
haven’t been able to do before.
• Auto-lock your PC when you are away
Wow, really, why not just log off? Yet
another sledgehammer to crack a nut.
• Better Start menu
Well if you like to have folders in your
Start menu then ﬁne, but I would
sooner just see my apps there.
So, all in all, I am very disappointed at
the supposed huge leap forward we were
all expecting. In my opinion, it simply has
not happened.

I
enjoy the columns Barry Collins
writes, but I challenge his reasoning
in Issue 421 about end-to-end
encryption. There is also a letter from
Peter Savage in your Inbox section
about encryption and privacy rights.
Barry emphasises that end-to-end
encryption is about data security
(and I agree that it is), but I cannot
understand why this is linked to issues
of personal privacy. The letter from
Peter Savage states that privacy is
a human right (it can only be this if
deﬁned properly), but there can be no
right of entitlement for criminality.
Society has never permitted this. So
where does this leave the argument?
Those who plead the human-rights
argument for privacy invariably suffer
an innate distrust of authority. I’ve
never understood this. Society
Online surveillance is for our protection
collectively performs what the individual
cannot – this is why we have
government. When this is bound by the
democratic right of consent (as it is in
this country), the distrust of government
cannot be sustained.
Privacy for the individual surely means
protection against those seeking
advantage at the expense of another.
Society cannot therefore permit the
proponents of privacy to inhibit law
enforcement and its duty to protect
the public. The innocent must never
be convicted, just as the guilty must
never walk free. This is why the
authorities undertake surveillance for
our protection and use it to defend
our liberties.
Although Amber Rudd might be
clueless on matters of encryption
(as Barry writes), her insistence that
the government needs access to
software such as WhatsApp is
interesting. It may also be misleading
and she might merely be luring
criminals into a false sense of security.
I support government surveillance of
the criminal and malevolent who wish
me and others harm – and so should
every right-thinking person.

Palicomp specs don’t
measure up
I am writing to advise you of a
discrepancy in the speciﬁcation of the
Palicomp AMD Avenger, which has
featured in your excellent Best Buys
section for some time now.
I bought my Palicomp AMD Avenger in
January and the speciﬁcations for this
machine in Web User at the time showed
it to have a Palit GTX 960 graphics card.
My machine actually has an ATI Radeon
RX 460 graphics card, which retails for
£75 less than the Palit card. A recent
issue of Web User is still showing the
Palit GTX 960 in the speciﬁcation.
I approached Palicomp for an
explanation and a refund. By reply, I was
sent a copy of my invoice (showing the
cheaper card) and a refusal of my refund
request.
The change
represents one
sixth of the
cost of the PC,
which no
longer looks
like such a
bargain since
Palicomp has
made no
adjustment in
price for the
cheaper card.
Palicomp
says that it contacted all media providers
with full details of the change in
speciﬁcation at the time the change was
made but, as mistakes can be made,
I would be grateful if you could change
your review to show the much cheaper
card from now on and prevent other
readers being misled in future.

I recently bought the Home because
I liked the look of it compared to the

a never-ending loop. After many long
telephone calls to Google’s helpline
(supposedly communicating with Home
specialists) and emails from Google that
suggested rebooting the Home, app and
router, the loop persists.
All elements of my
hardware and software
are well above the
requisite minimum
requirements. It seems
that Google does not
yet have an answer
to this problem and
I have no choice but
to return the Home.

We don’t really own the
ﬁlms we buy
As a longstanding ﬁlm fan, I like the
option not only to stream ﬁlms but to
buy them to keep. The TalkTalk TV Store
(www.talktalktvstore.co.uk) clearly
promises that you can buy a movie and
“own it forever” – something it proudly
trumpets on its website. However, I was
recently contacted by Talk Talk TV to say
that two ﬁlms I had purchased will soon
by deleted from its catalogue to make
way for new content, and that I would
not be able to watch them in the future.
Yes, they refunded my money, but I had
bought the ﬁlms to own forever.
When I contacted TalkTalk TV to
complain about this, I was told that the
terms and conditions say it has the
freedom to change its service whenever
it wants. There are no licensing issues
with the ﬁlms, so this is purely the
company’s
commercial
decision
to make
space on
its server.
I think it’s
important
that people
are aware
that when
you buy a ﬁlm you do not own the media
– you are simply buying the right to
stream it for as long as the company
wants to make this service available.
This raises questions about the rights
one has when purchasing digital media
and whether companies should be forced
to be more honest in their marketing.
Also, as a ﬁlm fan, I worry that it is the
arthouse and foreign-language ﬁlms that
will be sidelined by this approach,
because it will undoubtedly be the less
commercial ﬁlms that get deleted.

Give us free upgrades
to new formats
I completely concur with Frank Roman’s
letter in Issue 421, ‘Stop charging us for
the same
product’.
It’s ridiculous
that we have
to pay again
and again for
music and
ﬁlms, just to
keep up with the latest formats. I think
you should at least get a discount on
an album or ﬁlm when it’s issued in a
new format, if you can prove that you
already own it in a previous one.
One of the best things Amazon does
is to automatically give you free MP3
versions of every CD you’ve bought from
the store. Admittedly, it probably only
does this to get you to use its music-
streaming service, but it’s still a welcome
gesture. It would be even better if it gave
you free ebook versions of every book
you’ve bought from it – if you’re reading
this, Amazon, take note!

Someone has to pay for free
Kodi content
Why on Earth are people surprised that
pre-loaded Kodi boxes
ave been banned? These
hings have one purpose
nd one purpose only:
o allow the illegal free
streaming of services
that usually require
a paid subscription.
t’s ridiculous to pretend
otherwise and to
suggest that Kodi boxes are no different
from other streaming devices such as the
Roku and Amazon Fire TV Stick.
If people want to watch sport and
ﬁlms without paying for them, they
should bear in mind that someone
somewhere does still have to pay for that
content, whether it’s Sky or Virgin Media
or their customers. Why should those
of us who do things the proper, legal way
end up having our monthly bills
increased to make up the shortfall left
by the people who don’t pay?
I believe this whole Kodi situation has
gotten out of hand, and I’m only
surprised it’s taken this long for the
authorities to address it.

O YOU APPROVE OF THE
EU BANNING SO-CALLED
‘KODI TV BOXES’?
It makes no difference. People who
want one will still be able to get one.
Danny Pulley
Sky and Virgin are expensive. Going to
the cinema is expensive and noisy. The
BBC is nearly £150 for 80% repeats.
Sorry, but Kodi boxes do have their
place (and they are amazing!).
Paul Mudge
If Sky brought the prices down, there
would be less people willing to risk
dodgy websites, boxes, cards and now
Kodi systems.
Anthony Higham
They will just sell them illegally and
charge more for them. We need more
clarity on the laws for users too.

A
NEW BROADBAND SURVEY
SAYS BT AND TALKTALK
ARE THE WORST ISPs (bit.ly/
broadband423). DO YOU AGREE?
I have to agree about TalkTalk. Their
support is abysmal and their ‘ﬁbre’ is
lower than normal broadband speeds.
Despite several hundred calls to their
support, my problems have not been
resolved.
Greg Holmes
As an IT technician, I know BT are
horrendous for support and certainly
overpriced. This comes from years of
experience. Many of my customers
have switched, or are in the process of
switching.
David Piers
BT are ﬁne but expensive. Sometimes
internet speed nosedives over the
occasional weekend so I cannot
download HD programmes at all.
Lance Parkington
I have been with both and found BT
good, TalkTalk just okay.

O YOU WANT GOOGLE TO
ADD AN AD BLOCKER TO
CHROME (bit.ly/chrome423)?
Yes. I’ve used ad blockers since 1999.
Having ads is one thing but I hate
pop-ups and surveys. Companies
need to rethink how and when adverts
are shown. Maybe then I would be
happy to set up exclusions for certain
websites.
Gavin Green
If they did, it’d be too similar to
Adblock Plus where advertisers can
pay for their ads to be shown.
Martin Phillp
I prefer using third-party ad blockers
myself. I use Adblock Plus on
computers and 1Blocker on iOS
devices.
Davor Prcovich
An ad company blocking ads? Durr!

HY DO YOU THINK iPHONE
SALES HAVE FALLEN
(bit.ly/iphone423)?
Feature saturation, market saturation
and viable alternatives. If you look at
recent data, Samsung Galaxy S7 and
S7 Edge remain the biggest sellers,
with Huawei popular in Far East
(P9 and Honor V8).
Martin Brindley @martinbrindley
Because Android is more open and
customisable, and has better
hardware. I’ve still got my HTC One
M8, which is now three years old.

part in The Bill, so she knows how to
express empathy. She’s “terribly sorry
you’re thinking of leaving us” and is
going to “search our system to find you
a great deal”. She spends 10 minutes
pretending to type
things into her
computer before
offering you a 10%
discount and a
signed photo of
Bobby Davro.
That’s still a fiver
more than you
were paying when
you last signed a contract two years
ago, so it’s time to hold firm, maybe wait
a day or two, then open negotiations
with the Top Guns: the Retention
Department.
The Retention Department is where
you find Darren. He’s not let a customer
Barry Collins reveals three steps to
squeezing a good deal out of your ISP
Page 404
leave in four years, and he’s not about
to start now. Especially as you’ve called
him at the end of the month, when the
company is so worried about missing
sales targets that it’s entering anyone
who keeps
a customer into
a prize draw for
an all-expenses-
paid trip to
Disneyland Paris.
Darren’s never
been to Disneyland
Paris and his
daughter Kayleigh
is obsessed with Frozen. You’re his
Eurostar ticket outta here.
After reconfirming your full name,
postcode and third letter of your cat’s
middle name “for security purposes”,
you spend 20 minutes refusing to budge
until Darren hands you a two-year
contract for a fiver less
than you were paying in
the first place. Don’t
consider this a victory,
by the way – the “rising
cost of fibre glass” or
some other non-excuse
will “force them” to put
the price up by a fiver
within six months,
anyway. Still, you
manage to coerce
Darren into chucking in
a new router to
compensate you for the
three hours you’ve
spent on the phone
negotiating with him
and his colleagues.
Ultimately, the only
really good news is that
you won’t have to go
through this palaver for
another two years.

H
aving just renegotiated my
broadband contract for the
umpteenth time in my life,
this issue I proudly present
to you the Barry Collins Guide to
Contract Haggling. It’s basically
MoneySavingExpert without the
annoying chap who fronts it –
and also without the expertise.
My first piece of advice is to go
mano-a-mano. By all means see what
offers companies are prepared to give
you via their websites but if you want
the best deals, you’re going to have
to face down someone in a Dublin call
centre. Websites don’t negotiate, no
matter how many times you press F5.
Once you’ve picked up the phone,
spent 20 minutes battering your way
through the automated menus and
confirmed your full name, postcode
and mother’s blood group “for security
purposes”, you reach your
first call-centre dolt – let’s
call him Malcolm.
Malcolm is a ferocious
waste of molecules. He’s
only authorised to offer
a 5% discount and a
two-for-one ticket to
Thorpe Park. The savings
he can offer aren’t worth
the oxygen you’re going
to expend talking to him.
Declare a determined will
to leave and proceed
straight to support level
two, where the first glimpse
of a reasonable discount
will start to form.
Support level two is
manned by Julie. Part of
Julie’s two-day training
course was a role-playing
session led by someone
who once had a walk-on
