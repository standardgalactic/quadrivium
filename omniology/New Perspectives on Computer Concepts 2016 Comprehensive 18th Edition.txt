Preface	
i x
College graduates of the 21st century 
are expected to have a broad base of knowledge to 
intelligently address social, political, economic, and legal 
issues associated with rapidly evolving digital technology. 
Today’s students have a patchwork of knowledge, acquired 
from using various digital devices. New Perspectives on 
Computer Concepts 2016 (NP2016) helps students build 
a cohesive framework that organizes this acquired knowl-
edge and serves as a foundation for assimilating new 
concepts essential to careers and lifestyles in 
our digital world.
Fully Revised. NP2016 has been newly revised, reorganized, and updated to increase 
learning effectiveness and to reflect the wide scope of digital devices in use today, with an 
enhanced focus on the connectivity that pervades modern life.
Targeted Learning Support. This award-winning textbook contains layers of targeted 
learning support for active learning that keeps students engaged and helps them succeed. 
Now using the MindTap digital platform, students continue to benefit from interactive feed-
back and new collaborative opportunities. 
Reading in the Discipline. Short paragraphs and a clear narrative style help students 
grasp concepts and learn how to read technical material.
Retention. What’s the most effective study technique: Taking notes? Reviewing? According 
to researchers, students study most effectively by simply trying to recall the material they’ve read, 
seen, or heard. That’s why NP2016 offers continuous assessment. Embedded QuickChecks 
on just about every page help students recall key concepts while reading and later while reviewing. 
QuickQuizzes and end-of-unit reinforcement promote successful learning outcomes.
HAnds-On. NP2016 contains plenty of practical information about how to use apps, manage

NP2016
New Introduction. Using apps is a fine start toward digital literacy, but sophisticated 
understanding of social, political, technical, and economic issues related to digitization requires 
a big picture view of digital evolution. The new NP2016 Introduction puts “today” into context 
with in-depth coverage of the multi-phased digital revolution. 
New Social Media unit. Sure, students use social media, but are they familiar with 
underlying concepts, such as the social media honeycomb, geolocation, and sociograms? 
Are they up to speed with Creative Commons and intellectual property concepts? And do they 
understand the relevance of online identity, privacy, and reputation management? Unit 5 offers 
a fresh approach to social media that delves into concepts while also providing practical 
how-to tips.
New Security unit. NP2016 supplies a wealth of security tools and guidelines 
essential on both the personal and corporate levels. Security content is incorporated throughout 
the narrative, and a new security capstone, Unit 7, is devoted to the topic. Exploits from viruses 
to botnets, and from code injection to social engineering are presented in a clear learning path 
that provides a solid foundation for understanding current and emerging threats.
New Documentation Literacy. Unit 6 contains a new Information Tools activ-
ity that explores online manuals, Help, user forums, YouTube, and other sources of technical 
documentation for learning how to use software and troubleshooting.
The latest technology. The Internet of Things, near-field communication, fit-
ness monitors, smartwatches, new cloud technologies, and more. NP2016 content has 
expanded to encompass the full spectrum of microprocessor-based digital devices. 
Flipped classrooms. Flipping a course is easy with NP2016, which now includes 
flipped class projects for critical thinking, cyberclassroom exploration, collaborative 
group work, multimedia integration, career building, and globalization. Issues and other 
end-of-unit features offer additional topics and hands-on in-class activities.
Infographic illustrations. NP2016 has a new look. Illustrations based on popular 
infographic visuals are carefully integrated into the learning path to provide visual scaffolding 
that is so important to understanding technical concepts.

Student Resources: Hone Your Technical Reading Skills
If you would like to improve the way you comprehend and retain the 
information found in technical books and documentation, read on. 
Prepare. Your goal is to complete one section of a unit. That’s a sufficient 
amount of material for one session. Look at the concept map at the beginning 
of the section. It is designed to help you connect concepts in a web of relationships, 
so they become more than random facts.
Divide and conquer. Don’t expect to read technical material in the same 
way you’d read a novel. Trying to read without stopping from the beginning to the 
end of a unit, chapter, or section is likely to produce more confusion than confi-
dence. Instead, take it one paragraph at a time. Read the paragraph and 
then pause. Imagine that you are going to teach that material to someone else. 
Then summarize the main point in your own words. 
Take notes. When you come across a fact that you want to remember, make a 
note. A study conducted by researchers at UCLA and Princeton University revealed 
that students who take lecture notes using a pen or pencil scored better on tests 
than students who took notes on their laptops. The same effect may come into play 
when taking notes as you read. Whether you make notes on screen or on paper, 
make sure to use your own words. That will help you understand the essence 
of a concept and retain it for future use. 
Highlight. Use highlights to mark passages you do not understand. 
This advice may seem contrary to the idea of highlighting key concepts, but simply 
marking something in the book—or worse, copying and pasting passages from a 
digital book—does little to help you internalize a concept. Highlighting passages 
that you do not understand allows you to return to them after you’ve completed a 
section. You may find that the passage now makes sense. If not, you’ve marked a 
concept that will be a great question for your instructor. 
Read the Pictures. The figures in this book are included to reinforce, 
explain, and expand the information presented in the written narra-
tive. Concepts that may seem complex when explained in words may be much 
easier to visualize when you see an illustration, screenshot, or photo. So, take 
some time with each figure to make sure you understand how it is related to the 
text that precedes it.

Test Yourself. Researchers at Purdue University discovered that “practicing 
retrieval” through self testing is one of the most effective techniques for 
learning. NP2016 supplies you with lots of opportunities to retrieve material. 
Make sure to use the QuickChecks, QuickQuizzes, Interactive Summaries, and 
Interactive Situation Questions. Additional resources, such as flashcards and unit 
quizzes, are available with the NP2016 CourseMate and MindTap. 
Be an active learner. The concepts in NP2016 are not abstract theories. 
Most have practical applications for today’s digital lifestyles. You’ll find that con-
cepts are much easier to remember if you can apply them and understand how 
they are relevant. The Try It! activities throughout every unit show you how to 
apply concepts. The best learning strategy is to complete these activities as you 
encounter them. They’ll give you a break from reading and help you to understand 
how all the practical and conceptual pieces fit together.
Get the Connections. The bubble diagrams supplied at the beginning of 
each section provide an overview of concepts and their linkages. After reading a 
section, you might want to extend the concept maps by adding more details. 
You can add another level of concepts. Also, think of additional relationships 
between the existing concepts and mark them with dotted lines.

NP2016
So much has changed since the first edition of Computer Concepts was pub-
lished in 1994! From year to year, the changes have been subtle, but looking 
back, it is clear that technology, students, and even education has progressed 
in amazing and sometimes unexpected directions. The conceptual framework 
of the original text served students and instructors well for over twenty years, 
but for NP2016, we took a fresh look at the digital landscape to restructure the 
content as the digital age enters a new phase.
Many of today’s students have substantially more practical experience with 
digital devices than their counterparts of fifteen years ago, but even these stu-
dents may lack a cohesive framework for their knowledge. The goal of New 
Perspectives on Computer Concepts is to bring every student up to speed with 
computer basics, and then go beyond basic computer literacy to provide tech-
nical and practical information that every college-educated person would be 
expected to know. 
Whether you are an instructor or a student, we hope that you enjoy the learning 
experience provided by our text-based and technology-based materials.

The Digital Revolution
The digital revolution is an ongoing process of social, political, and eco-
nomic change brought about by digital technology, such as microchips, 
computers, and the Internet. 
	What is digital? Digital refers to data represented by numbers, such 
as 1s and 0s. The word digital comes from the root digit, which refers to a 
numeral less than 10. In Latin, the word digitus means finger or toe. The 
modern use of the term digital is probably derived from the idea of counting 
on your fingers. 
Like the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution, the digital 
revolution offers advantages but requires adaptations. Digital innovations 
challenge the status quo and require societies to make adjustments to tradi-
tions, lifestyles, and legislation. 
The technology driving the digital revolution is based on digital electronics 
and the idea that electrical signals can represent data, such as numbers, 
words, pictures, and music. An interesting characteristic of digital content 
is that it can be easily duplicated with no loss of quality. Before digital, pho-
tocopies of paper documents usually looked blurred. Copying a movie on 
tape reduced its quality, and every subsequent copy became progressively 
worse. Now, digital copies are essentially indistinguishable from originals, 
which has created new possibilities for content distribution on platforms 
such as iTunes and Netflix.
Digital devices, including computers and smartphones, have transformed 
our world. Without them, your favorite form of entertainment would probably 
be foosball, and you’d be listening to a bulky old Victrola instead of carrying 
a sleek iPod (Figure 1).

INTRODUCTION
DATA PROCESSING
Some historians mark the 1980s as the beginning of the digital revolution, 
but engineers built the first digital computers during World War II for break-
ing codes and calculating missile trajectories. In the 1950s, computers were 
marketed for business applications, such as payroll and inventory manage-
ment. 
	What was computing like back then? In the first phase of the digi-
tal revolution, computers were huge, complex, and expensive devices that 
stored data on reels of magnetic tape. They existed in limited numbers, pri-
marily housed in big corporations and government agencies. Computers 
were operated by trained technicians. Each computer installation required 
specialized software. The idea that computers might be used by ordinary 
people in their homes was only a glimmer of an idea in the minds of science 
fiction writers.
Back then, processing components for computers were housed in closet-
sized cabinets. The main computer unit did not usually include a keyboard 
or display device. Computers were accessed using the keyboard and dis-
play screen of a terminal. Terminals had little processing capability of their 
own, so they were simply used to enter data and view results produced by 
software that ran on the main computer.
This method of computing, in which a main computer holds all of the data 
and performs all of the processing, is called centralized computing. It is 
the main technology model used during the data processing era. Devices 
such as terminals and printers are connected to a centralized computer with 
cables, as shown in Figure 2.

THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION	
5
I
	Who had access to computers? During the antiestablishment era of 
the 1960s, the digital revolution was beginning to transform organizations, 
but ordinary people had little direct contact with computers. 
As with many new technologies, computers were initially viewed with sus-
picion by consumers. IBM’s corporate slogan “THINK” conveyed to some 
people a disturbing image of giant machine “brains.”
Computers seemed remote. They were housed out of sight in special facili-
ties and were inaccessible to ordinary people. Computers also seemed 
impersonal. To uniquely identify people, computers used sequences of 
numbers such as Social Security numbers. The fact that computers tracked 
people by numbers, rather than by their names, alienated many students 
and workers. 
In the 1960s, computers and punched cards became a symbol of the estab-
lishment. Students were uncomfortable with the use of punched cards 
for storing student records (Figure 3). Said one leader of a protest on the 
University of California, Berkeley campus, “You’re processed. You become 
a number on a set of file cards that go through an IBM machine.”
	What is data processing? Throughout the first phase of the digital 
revolution, businesses adopted computers with increasing enthusiasm 
based on benefits such as cutting costs and managing mountains of data. 
Computers and data processing became crucial tools for effective business 
operations. Data processing is based on an input-processing-output cycle. 
Data goes into a computer, it is processed, and then it is output (Figure 4).
The data processing era lasted from the 1940s through the 1970s. Data 
processing installations still exist today, but other technologies emerged, 
making computing available to a more diverse group of users. 
Figure 3: Antiestablishment
In the 1950s and 1960s, data 
used by government and busi-
ness computers was coded 
onto punched cards that 
contained the warning “Do 
not fold, tear, or mutilate this 
card.” Similar slogans were 
used by protesters who were 
concerned that computers 
would have a dehumanizing 
effect on society.

INTRODUCTION
PERSONAL COMPUTING
Digital devices were first available to consumers in the 1970s, when 
handheld calculators and digital watches hit store shelves. The first per-
sonal computers made their debut in 1976, but sales got off to a slow start. 
Without compelling software applications, personal computers, such as the 
Apple II and IBM PC, seemed to offer little for their $3,000 price tag. As the 
variety of software increased, however, consumer interest grew.  
	What is personal computing? The second phase of the digital rev-
olution, personal computing, is characterized by standalone computers 
powered by local software. Local software refers to any software that is 
installed on a computer’s storage device. Today, local software resides on 
hard disks, solid state drives, and flash drives. In the personal computing 
era, local software was often stored on floppy disks.
During this phase of the digital revolution, computers were used to enhance 
productivity. Writing, gathering numbers into easily understood charts, and 
scheduling were popular computer-based activities. Computers and video-
game machines emerged as entertainment devices, with the game industry 
driving the development of ever faster and more sophisticated digital com-
ponents.
During the personal computing phase of the digital revolution, computers 
were not connected to networks, so they were essentially self-contained 
units that allowed users to interact only with installed software. On the busi-
ness front, large computers continued to run payroll, inventory, and financial 
software. Some managers used personal computers and spreadsheet soft-
ware to crunch numbers for business planning. 
If you owned a computer back in the second phase of the digital revolution, 
it was probably a standalone machine with primitive sound capabilities. The 
display device looked like an old-fashioned television (Figure 5).

	How extensive was computer use? In contrast to the corporate 
focus of the data processing phase, personal computing promised to put 
the power of digital devices in the hands of ordinary people. Computers 
were no longer a symbol of the corporate establishment. As a new genera-
tion of computing devices evolved, IBM’s “THINK” slogan was upstaged by 
Apple’s message: “Think Different.”
The promise of populist computing, however, was not backed up with com-
pelling reasons to invest in a computer. In 1982, fewer than 10% of U.S. 
households had a computer. Working on a standalone computer wasn’t 
for everyone. People without an interest in typing up corporate reports or 
school papers, crunching numbers for accounting, or playing computer 
games weren’t tempted to become active soldiers in the digital revolution. 
Social scientists even worried that if personal computing became wide-
spread, people would become increasingly isolated as they focused on 
computer activities rather than social ones. Although rudimentary email sys-
tems existed on centralized corporate computer systems, home computers 
were not connected, so there was no way to transmit email messages. 
	How long was the second phase of the digital revolution? 
Computer ownership increased at a gradual pace until the mid-1990s, and 
then it accelerated into the third phase of the digital revolution (Figure 6).

INTRODUCTION
NETWORK COMPUTING
The third phase of the digital revolution materialized as computers became 
networked and when the Internet was opened to public use. A com-
puter network is a group of computers linked together to share data and 
resources. 
Network technology existed before the Internet became popular, but it was 
mainly deployed to connect computers within a school or business. Those 
networks were complicated to set up and they were often unreliable. Before 
the Internet opened to public use, online services, such as CompuServe 
and America Online operated centralized computer networks that could be 
accessed by the public from dial-up modems.
	What role did the Internet play? The Internet is a global com-
puter network that was originally developed as a military project and was 
later handed over to the National Science Foundation for research and aca-
demic use. When restrictions on commercial use of the Internet were lifted 
in the early 1990s, newly emerged ISPs offered fee-based Internet access. 
America Online, CompuServe, and other online services expanded to offer 
Internet-based chat and Web access. Excerpts from the AOL ad in Figure 7 
may help you to appreciate the digital environment during this phase of the 
digital revolution.

THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION	
9
I
QuickCheck
The Web and the Internet are 
not the same. Why?
a. The Internet is a 
communication network, but 
the Web consists of content 
that is distributed by the 
Internet.
b. The Internet consists of sites 
such as Twitter and Facebook, 
whereas the Web links 
devices such as iPods and 
computers.
	What about the Web? When historians look back on the digital 
revolution, they are certain to identify the Web as a major transformative 
influence. The Web (short for World Wide Web) is a collection of linked 
documents, graphics, and audio that can be accessed over the Internet. 
A key aspect of the Web is that it adds content and substance to the Internet. 
Without the Web, the Internet would be like a library without any books or a 
railroad without any trains. Online storefronts, auction sites, news, sports, 
travel reservations, and music downloads made the Web a compelling digi-
tal technology for just about everyone. 
	So what was computing like during this phase? From 1995 to 
2010, computing was characterized by the increasing use of laptops (Figure 
8) and the following elements:
Sophisticated software. The network computing phase may have been 
the peak for productivity software. Computer owners amassed large collec-
tions of software, purchased in boxes containing multiple distribution CDs. 
Software such as Microsoft Office, Norton’s Internet Security suite, and 
Corel Digital Studio required local installation and provided more features 
than most people had any desire to use. This trend reverses during the next 
phase of the digital revolution, when applications become simpler and more 
focused on specific tasks. 
Stationary Internet access. Even as laptop computers began to dis-
place desktop models, connecting to the Internet required a cable that 
effectively tethered computers to a nearby phone jack or cable outlet. In the 
next phase of the digital revolution, Internet access breaks free from cables 
and goes mobile.
Online communication. Email was the first widespread technology used 
to communicate over the Internet. Online services such as CompuServe 
and AOL pioneered chat rooms, which were primitive versions of Google 
Hangouts, and forums, which were similar to Facebook newsfeeds. A tech-
nology called Voice over IP allowed participants to bypass the telephone 
company to make phone calls over the Internet, and that technology even-
tually developed into Skype and similar video chat services. 
Multiplayer games. Sophisticated computer games reached a peak dur-
ing the network phase of the digital revolution. Audio and visual hardware 
components improved to support video-realistic game environments, arti-
ficial intelligence opponents, and multiple players logging in remotely and 
chatting with other players over headsets. In the next phase, mobile devices 
become popular gaming platforms, but hardware limitations restrict the 
feature set. 
Music downloads. During the network computing phase, an online 
business called Napster pioneered the concept of sharing and down-
loading music. Subscribers exchanged millions of music files, which 
they played through the speakers of their computers. The music was 
protected by copyright, however, making sharing and distribution illegal. 
This type of file sharing activity and rampant software piracy became 
one of the defining problems associated with the network phase of 
the digital revolution.
iTunes and other services for legally downloading music soon 
appeared, along with dedicated playback devices, such as the 
iPod. Video distribution over the Internet lagged behind until con-
nection speeds increased in the next phase of the digital revolution.
Figure 8: Laptops
Laptop computers were the 
primary devices for accessing 
the Internet prior to 2010, but 
applications, media, and data 
remained on the local hard 
disk.

INTRODUCTION
CLOUD COMPUTING
Around 2010, the Information Age eased into a new phase called cloud 
computing, which provided access to information, applications, communi-
cations, and storage over the Internet. 
	What did cloud computing change? Before cloud computing, 
most computers ran software based locally. For example, to use a word 
processor, you might fire up the latest edition of Microsoft Word, which 
you’d installed on your computer’s hard disk. Prior to the cloud, you stored 
data locally, too. Email, documents, photos, and music all resided on your 
computer’s hard disk or flash drive. 
With cloud computing, all that changes. You can use your browser to access 
word processing applications that run from the Internet instead of software 
that you have installed on your local hard disk. You can use online applica-
tions to manage your email, create floor plans, produce presentations, and 
carry out a host of other activities. You can store your data in the cloud, 
too, making it available on any of your digital devices that connect to the 
Internet.
The cloud gets its name from diagrams like the one in Figure 9, which 
shows Internet-based applications, storage, and other services outlined by 
a cloud-like shape designed to help you visualize the idea that cloud ser-
vices are “out there” somewhere on the Internet.

computing most sets it apart 
from network computing?

b. Sophisticated software
c. The migration of applications 
and data off of local devices
d. File sharing
	Wait, this sounds familiar! If cloud computing sounds a bit like cen-
tralized computing, you’re paying attention. The concept of applications and 
data residing somewhere other than on a local device is common to both 
centralized and cloud computing. The fact that your data is not under your 
direct control is a potential privacy and security concern, which is a topic for 
later units.

THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION	
1 1
I
	What is convergence? The expansion of cloud computing is due in 
part to convergence, a process by which several technologies with distinct 
functionalities evolve to form a single product. Your computer plays movies. 
Your cell phone has a camera. Your clock has a radio. Your watch func-
tions as a compass. You can store data on your iPod Touch. All these are 
examples of technological convergence.
Convergence worked its magic on cell phones, computers, portable media 
players, digital cameras, GPSs, watches, and ebook readers. Now you get 
features from all of them by purchasing a single digital device (Figure 10). 
Whether you purchase a full-size computer, a sophisticated mobile phone, 
or even a game console, you generally have access to software, music, 
photos, ebooks, movies, communications, and the Web.
Convergence is important to the digital revolution because it created sophis-
ticated mobile devices whose owners demand access to the same services 
available from a full-size desktop computer. 
Your smartphone isn’t usually in range of the cable modem in your house, 
so it needs a different way to access the Internet. Your iPad is too small for 
a huge hard disk, so it needs an alternative place to store data and applica-
tions. Touchscreen devices are not great for typing tasks, so cloud-based 
apps can be specially designed to suit the use of gestures or dictation 
rather than a mouse and keyboard. You can see how these mobile devices 
require a solution such as cloud computing to provide a full spectrum of 
digital services.

INTRODUCTION
	Is the Web dead? A 2010 Wired magazine cover announced “The 
Web Is Dead.” That pronouncement was premature, but Facebook, Twitter, 
and Google Apps sent computing in new directions. The Web changed from 
a collection of storefronts run by businesses and corporations to a globe-
spanning hub where content is created by individuals, shared on social 
media sites, and uploaded to content sharing platforms. The shift from top-
down content to grassroots content is sometimes referred to as Web 2.0.
	What role do social media play? The fourth phase of the digital 
revolution turned the worry of social isolation on its head; instead of com-
puters decreasing human interaction, social media encourage interpersonal 
communications and relationships. Social media are cloud-based applica-
tions designed for social interaction and consumer-generated content.
Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter became some of the first popular social 
media services. Myspace lost steam in 2008, but Facebook and Twitter 
marched ahead by attracting millions of users. Many factors influenced 
the popularity of these sites, but one important factor is their ease of use. 
As cloud-based services, there is no software to install and there are no 
updates to worry about. Getting started is as simple as registering your 
name and creating a password. 
The connections that social media offer come at a price, and that price is 
not just monetary. Today’s digital citizens surrender a substantial amount of 
privacy and open avenues by which they can become victims of predators. 
Privacy, or the lack of it, may be the defining challenge of cloud computing.
	How is today’s computing different from that of the past? 
When using computers during the fourth phase of the digital revolution, 
the touchscreen on your mobile device gives you access to apps that play 
music, show movies, report news and sports scores, help you find the near-
est Starbucks, and all kinds of other fun stuff. You regularly use Google 
or Wikipedia to access information. When you need to produce a docu-
ment, you can access a cloud-based word processor. You spend lots of 
time maintaining your profiles on social networking services and interacting 
with friends through cloud-based social media. 
As the digital revolution progressed, technology changed, as did the way 
we use it (Figure 11).

THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION

I
	What is the future of the digital revolution? If we can learn 
one thing from the evolving Information Age, it is this: change is inevita-
ble. Today, your favorite social media platform is Facebook; in the future, 
Facebook may go the way of CompuServe. You’re comfortable with a 
touchscreen now, but in the future, digital devices might be controlled by 
your neural impulses.
On the near horizon, the Internet of Things seems to be gaining momen-
tum. Picture virtually every appliance—every washing machine, vending 
machine, vehicle, door latch, plumbing fixture, light bulb, gadget, and doo-
hickey—equipped with a computer chip and transmitter. Then picture these 
devices communicating with each other. Your refrigerator senses that an 
item has been removed and confirms with your trashcan that you’ve thrown 
away an empty Cool Whip container. It checks your smartphone, discovers 
you’re at the supermarket, and sends you a text message saying “Buy Cool 
Whip.”
	So what’s the point? Learning about digital technology is not just 
about circuits and electronics, nor is it only about digital gadgets, such as 
computers and portable music players. Digital technology permeates the 
very core of modern life. Understanding how this technology works and 
thinking about its potential can help you comprehend many issues related 
to privacy, security, freedom of speech, and intellectual property. It will help 
you become a better consumer and give you insights into local and world 
events. 
As you continue to read this textbook, don’t lose sight of the big picture. On 
one level, you might be simply learning about how to use a computer and 
software in this course. On a more profound level, however, you are accu-
mulating knowledge about how digital technology applies to broader cultural 
and legal issues that are certain to affect your life far into the future.

data representation Basics
Digital content, such as ebooks, documents, images, music, and video, is 
a compilation of data. Data refers to the symbols that represent people, 
events, things, and ideas. Data can be a name, a number, the colors in a 
photograph, or the notes in a musical composition.
	Is there a difference between data and information? In 
everyday ­conversation, people use the terms data and information 
interchangeably. However, some technology professionals make a 
distinction between the two terms. They define data as the symbols that 
represent people, events, things, and ideas. Data becomes ­information 
when it is ­presented in a format that people can understand and use. 
As a general rule, remember that (technically speaking) data is used by 
machines, such as computers; information is used by humans. 
	What is data representation? Data representation refers to the 
form in which data is stored, processed, and transmitted. Devices such as 
smartphones, iPods, and computers store data in digital formats that can 
be handled by electronic circuitry. Today, digital data representation has 
replaced the analog data previously used for storing and transmitting pho-
tos, videos, and text. 
	What’s the difference between analog and digital? Digital 
data is text, numbers, graphics, sound, and video that have been con-
verted into discrete digits such as 0s and 1s. In contrast, analog data is 
represented using an infinite scale of values. For a simple illustration of the 
difference between analog and digital, consider the way you can control the 
lights in a room using a traditional light switch or a dimmer switch. 
A dimmer switch has a rotating dial that controls a continuous range of 
brightness. It is, therefore, analog. A traditional light switch, on the other 
hand, has two discrete states: on and off. There are no in-between states, 
so this type of light switch is digital. 
A traditional light switch is also binary because there are only two possible 
states. Technically, a digital device could represent data using more than 
two states. Some of the earliest computers represented numbers using the 
decimal system. Today, however, most digital devices represent numbers 
and other data using the binary system. 
Terminology
The word data can be correctly 
treated either as a plural noun 
or as an abstract mass noun, 
so the phrases “The data are 
being processed” and “The data 
is being processed” are both 
correct usage. In this textbook, 
the word data is paired with 
singular verbs and modifiers.

SECTION a, Unit 1
	How does digital data work? The process of converting informa-
tion, such as text, numbers, photos, or music, into digital data that can be 
manipulated by electronic devices is called digitization. 
Imagine that you want to send a message by flashing a light. Your light 
switch offers two states: on and off. You can use sequences of ons and offs 
to represent various letters of the alphabet. To write down the representa-
tion for each letter, you can use 0s and 1s. The 0s represent the off state of 
your light switch; the 1s indicate the on state. For example, the sequence 
on on off off would be written as 1100, and you might decide that sequence 
represents the letter A.
The 0s and 1s used to represent digital data are referred to as binary digits. 
It is from this term that we get the word bit—binary digit. A bit is a 0 or 1 
used in the digital representation of data. 
Digital devices are electronic and so you can envision bits flowing within 
these devices as pulses of light. But digital signals can take many forms, as 
shown in Figure 1-1. 
	How is digital data stored? Digital data is typically stored in files. A 
digital file, usually referred to simply as a file, is a named collection of data 
that exists on a storage medium, such as a hard disk, CD, DVD, or flash 
drive. A file can contain data for a term paper, Web page, email message, or 
music video. 
Every file has a unique name, such as Thriller.mp3. A file name extension, 
such as .mp3, can be appended to the end of the file name after a period. 
This extension indicates the file format; the type of data in the file and the 
way it is encoded. Let’s take a look at how numbers, text, images, sound, 
and video are encoded into digital formats that become computer files.

Representing Numbers
Numeric data consists of numbers that can be used in arithmetic opera-
tions. For example, your annual income is numeric data, as is your age. That 
concept seems obvious, but some data that looks numeric is represented 
differently. Social Security numbers, telephone numbers, street numbers, 
and similar data are not represented in the same way as numbers. These 
“numerals” are not considered numeric data because they are never used in 
mathematical calculations. This numeric quirk is a key concept in the digital 
world and turns up when you work with spreadsheets, databases, and com-
puter programming.
	How do digital devices represent numbers? Digital devices rep-
resent numeric data using the binary number system, also called base 2. 
The binary number system has only two digits: 0 and 1. No numeral like 
2 exists in this system, so the number “two” is represented in binary as 
10 (pronounced “one zero”). You’ll understand why if you think about what 
happens when you’re counting from 1 to 10 in the familiar decimal system. 
After reaching 9, you run out of digits. For ten, you have to use the digits 
10—zero is a placeholder and the 1 indicates one group of tens.
In binary, you just run out of digits sooner—right after you count to 1. To get 
to the next number, you use 0 as a placeholder and 1 indicates one group 
of twos. In binary, then, you count 0 (zero), 1 (one), 10 (one zero), instead 
of counting 0, 1, 2 in decimal. If you need to brush up on binary numbers, 
refer to Figure 1-2.

The important point to understand is that the binary number system allows 
digital devices to represent virtually any number simply by using 0s and 
1s. Digital devices can then perform calculations using these numbers. The 
ability to perform rapid and accurate calculations was the key feature of the 
first computers, and it now provides the foundation for online banking and 
ecommerce.

SECTION a, Unit 1
Representing Text
Character data is composed of letters, symbols, and numerals that are 
not used in calculations. Examples of character data include your name, 
address, and hair color. Character data is commonly referred to as “text.”
	How do digital devices represent text? Digital devices employ 
several types of codes to represent character data, including ASCII, 
Unicode, and their variants. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange, pronounced “ASK ee”) requires seven bits for each charac-
ter. For example, the ASCII code for an uppercase A is 1000001. ASCII 
provides codes for 128 characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase 
letters, punctuation symbols, and numerals. 
Extended ASCII is a superset of ASCII that uses eight bits for each char-
acter. For example, Extended ASCII represents the uppercase letter A as 
01000001. Using eight bits instead of seven bits allows Extended ASCII to 
provide codes for 256 characters. The additional Extended ASCII charac-
ters include boxes and other graphical symbols. 
Unicode (pronounced “YOU ni code”) uses sixteen bits and provides codes 
for 65,000 characters—a real bonus for representing the alphabets of mul-
tiple languages. 
UTF-8 is a variable-length coding scheme that uses seven bits for common 
ASCII characters, but uses 16-bit Unicode as necessary.
Take a look at the ASCII codes in Figure 1-3. Notice there is a code for the 
space character in addition to codes for symbols, numerals, uppercase let-
ters, and lowercase letters.

	Why are there ASCII codes for numbers? While glancing at the 
table of ASCII codes in Figure 1-3, you might have wondered why the table 
contains codes for 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. Aren’t these numbers represented 
by the binary number system? Yes, the binary number system is used for 
representing numeric data, but these ASCII codes are used for numerals, 
such as Social Security numbers and phone numbers that are not used for 
calculations. For example, 475-6677 is a phone number; it is not a formula 
that means subtract 6677 from 475. 
	Where is digital text used? Digital text is everywhere. It is the foun-
dation for all kinds of digital documents, Web sites, social media sites, 
games, and email. It is also the basis for ebooks designed for Kindles and 
other ebook readers.
Documents produced on a digital device are stored as a string of 1s and 0s 
encoded as ASCII, Unicode, or UTF-8. Some kinds of documents simply 
contain this plain text, whereas other documents contain formatting codes 
to produce bold fonts, columns, and other effects.
	What is plain text? Plain, unformatted text is sometimes called ASCII 
text and is stored in a so-called “text file” with a name ending in .txt. On 
Apple devices, these files are labeled “Plain Text.” In Windows, these files 
are labeled “Text Document,” like this:
QuickCheck
If your address is 10 B Street, what 
are the first three bytes in ASCII?
a.	 00110001  00110000  01000010
b.	 00110001  00110000  00100000
c.	 00110001  00110111  00100000
ASCII text files can be created with text editors, such as TextEdit and 
Notepad. They are typically used for writing computer programs because 
executable program code cannot include formatting such as underlining 
and special fonts. They can also be used for creating Web pages. Text files 
can usually be opened by any word processing software regardless of the 
type of device. In that sense, they are universal. Figure 1-4 illustrates an 
ASCII text file and the actual binary code that is stored for it.

To create documents with styles and formats, formatting codes have to be 
embedded in the text. There are many techniques for doing so, and each 
one produces a unique file format. These formats can be opened by the 
software that produced them. Opening those files with other kinds of soft-
ware requires conversion.
Microsoft Word produces formatted text and creates documents in DOCX 
format, whereas iWork Pages produces documents in PAGES format. 
Adobe Acrobat produces documents in PDF format. The HTML markup lan-
guage used for Web pages produces documents in HTML format. Ebooks 
are created using the EPUB format.
Formatting codes can be added to documents directly within the text 
stream, using some sort of delimiter to signal the beginning and end of 
the formatting command. When the document is displayed, the formatting 
codes are hidden. What do those hidden codes look like? Figure 1-5 gives 
you a behind-the-scenes look at the Roller Coasters document with all the 
embedded formatting codes revealed.
Terminology
A delimiter is a special character 
used to separate commands or 
formatting characters from the 
rest of the text in a file. Slashes 
// and angle brackets < > are 
commonly used delimiters. 
Here is the document 
title. The formatting 
codes that make it bold 
are delimited by < and 
> angle brackets.

	What happens when I scan a document? When using a scanner 
to digitize a document, you may have a choice between graphics formats 
and OCR. Graphics formats, presented later in the unit, essentially capture 
a photo of the document. Individual letters and punctuation marks are not 
encoded as ASCII. A document scanned into a graphics format cannot be 
edited using a word processor. 
OCR (optical character recognition) is a process that interprets individual 
characters during or after a scan. It assigns the appropriate ASCII code to 
each letter and outputs the document in a format that can be edited using 
word processing software. OCR software is available for most scanners 
and is handy when you have a printed copy of a document that you want to 
modify, but would prefer not to retype.
bits and bytes
All of the data stored and transmitted by digital devices is encoded as bits. 
Terminology related to bits and bytes is extensively used to describe stor-
age capacity and network access speed. As a digital-goods consumer, 
you’ll want to have this terminology handy.
	What is the difference between bits and bytes? Even though 
the word bit is an abbreviation for binary digit, it can be further abbreviated, 
usually as a lowercase b. A group of eight bits is called a byte and is usually 
abbreviated as an uppercase B. 
Transmission speeds are expressed in bits, whereas storage space is 
expressed in bytes. For example, a cable Internet connection might transfer 
data from the Internet to your computer at 8 megabits per second. In an 
iPad ad, you might notice that it can store up to 60 gigabytes of music and 
video.
	What do the prefixes kilo-, mega-, giga-, and tera- mean? 
When reading about digital devices, you’ll frequently encounter references 
such as 50 kilobits per second, 1.44 megabytes, 2.8 gigahertz, and 2 tera-
bytes. Kilo, mega, giga, tera, and similar terms are used to quantify digital 
data as shown in Figure 1-6.

	Why such odd numbers? In common usage, kilo, abbreviated as K, 
means a thousand. For example, $50K means $50,000. In the context of 
computers, however, 50K means 51,200. Why the difference? In the deci-
mal number system we use on a daily basis, the number 1,000 is 10 to the 
third power, or 103. For digital devices where base 2 is the norm, a kilo is 
precisely 1,024, or 210. Mega is derived from 220 and giga from 230.

computer scientists have 
proposed alternative terminology 
to dispel the ambiguity in terms 
such as mega that can mean 
1,000 or 1,024. They suggest the 
following prefixes:
Kibi = 1,024 
Mebi = 1,048,576
Gibi = 1,073,741,824

the scan into a document 
that can be edited using word 
processing software.

post on your Facebook page
c.	 An iTunes track saved to 
your iPod that you want to

Compression
All those 1s and 0s can quickly expand the size of digital files. Whereas 
an “A” is simply one character in a printed document, it requires seven bits 
when represented as ASCII and sixteen bits when represented as Unicode. 
That “1” in “1st place” seems like it could be represented by a simple 1 bit, 
but it requires multiple bits when encoded. Numeric data also requires lots 
of bits. The number 10 is 1010 in binary and requires four bits.
To reduce file size and transmission times, digital data can be compressed. 
Data compression refers to any technique that recodes the data in a file 
so that it contains fewer bits. Compression is commonly referred to as “zip-
ping.” Many compression techniques exist. They can be divided into two 
categories: lossless and lossy. 
	What is the difference between lossless and lossy compression? 
Lossless compression provides a way to compress data and reconsti-
tute it into its original state. Character data and numeric data in documents 
and spreadsheets are compressed using lossless techniques so that the 
uncompressed data is exactly the same as the original data. 
Lossy compression throws away some of the original data during the 
compression process. When the data is uncompressed, it is not exactly the 
same as the original. This type of compression is typically used for music, 
images, and videos because the human ear or eye cannot discern minor 
changes. Later in the unit, you’ll learn more about the compression tech-
niques used to shrink the size of music, image, and video files.

Kilobyte (KB or Kbyte) 
is often used when

	How do I compress data? The software for compressing data is 
sometimes referred to as a compression utility or a zip tool. Most computers 
include software for compressing data, but tablets and smartphones may 
require a third-party app for working with compressed data. 
On laptops and desktop computers, the compression utility is accessed 
from the same screen used to manage files. You can compress the data in 
a single file or you can combine multiple files to create a single zipped file 
that is reconstituted to the original files when unzipped (Figure 1-8).

	How do I return files to their uncompressed state? The process 
of reconstituting files is called extracting or unzipping. As with compression, 
most laptops and desktop computers include extraction and unzipping soft-
ware; tablets and smartphones may require a third-party app.
Compressed files usually have .zip at the end of the file name and are rep-
resented with specialty icons. Compressed files may also end with .gz, 
.pkg, or .tar.gz. These files have to be extracted or unzipped before you can 
view the data they contain. The process is easy. To extract a file on a Mac, 
simply double-click the zipped folder. With Windows (Figure 1-9), use the 
Compressed Folder Tools or Extract All option.

SECTION b, Unit 1
Digital audio basics
Digital audio is music, speech, and other sounds represented in binary for-
mat for use in digital devices. It is a key technology used by popular music 
services such as iTunes and Spotify. It also plays a role in natural language 
interactions, such as voice messaging, Google Voice Search, and Siri.
	How do I record sound? Most digital devices have a built-in 
microphone and audio software, so recording external sounds, such as 
narrations, is easy. Additional software, such as Soundflower, might be 
required to capture sound that is playing on your computer from Internet 
radio, podcasts, or online television shows.
	How is sound digitized? Sound is produced by the vibration of mat-
ter such as a violin string or a drum head. This vibration causes pressure 
changes in the surrounding air, creating waves. The smooth, continuous 
curve of a sound wave can be directly recorded on analog media, such as 
vinyl records or cassette tape, but digital recordings are based on samples 
of a sound wave.
To digitally record sound, samples of a sound wave are collected at periodic 
intervals and stored as numeric data in an audio file. For example, when 
you record a voice message on your phone, the sound waves of your voice 
are sampled many times per second by an analog-to-digital converter 
(ADC). Those samples are converted into binary 1s and 0s, which are 
stored in an audio file. When the audio file is played, a digital-to-analog 
converter (DAC) transforms the digital bits into analog sound waves and 
outputs them through the speakers. Figure 1-10 shows how a sound wave 
is digitally sampled. 
Figure 1-10: DIGITIZING A SOUND WAVE 
To digitize a wave, it is sliced into 
vertical segments, called samples. For 
purposes of illustration, this one-second 
sound wave was sliced into 30 samples.
An analog sound wave 
is a smooth curve of 
continuous values.

­equivalent—10100000.

	Does sampling rate affect sound quality? Sampling rate refers 
to the number of times per second that a sound is measured during the 
recording process. It is expressed in hertz (Hz). One thousand samples 
per second is expressed as 1,000 Hz or 1 kHz (kilohertz). Higher sam-
pling rates increase the quality of the sound recording but require more 
storage space than lower sampling rates.
To conserve space, applications that do not require high-quality sound use 
low sampling rates. Voice-overs and narrations are often recorded with 
sampling rates of 11 kHz (11,000 samples per second). This rate results in 
lower quality sound, but the file is about one-fourth the size of a file for the 
same sound recorded at 44.1 kHz. Figure 1-11 illustrates how sampling rate 
affects sound quality and file size.
Figure 1-11: Sampling rate, sound quality, and file size

	How much space is required to store an audio file? When sam-
pling stereo high-fidelity music at 44.1 kHz, one second of music requires 
about 0.176 MB of storage space. Forty-five minutes of music—the length 
of a typical album—requires about 475 MB. You might wonder how audio 
files rack up so much space.
The height of each sound sample is saved as a 16-bit number for high-
fidelity recordings. To achieve stereo effects, you must take two of these 
16-bit samples. Therefore, each sample requires 32 bits of storage space. A 
sampling rate of 44.1 kHz records 44,100 32-bit samples per second. Here 
is the calculation:

SECTION b, Unit 1
	Is there any way to compress audio files? Regardless of sam-
pling rate, digital audio file size can be reduced using audio compression 
techniques. Audio compression reduces the size of a sound file by remov-
ing bits that represent extraneous noise and sounds that are beyond the 
frequencies of normal hearing. 
Most music for portable media players is stored in compressed audio file 
formats. These lossy formats reduce the size of audio files, but also reduce 
their quality. Sophisticated listeners can tell the difference, but most casual 
listeners are content with the quality produced by compressed files stream-
ing from an iPod or a similar device. Files in compressed formats, such as 
MP3, don’t get much smaller if you subsequently use general compression 
tools provided by Finder and File Explorer.
Files containing “raw” noncompressed audio can be compressed using 
the same general compression tools used for text and numeric data. For 
example, using lossless tools provided by Finder and File Explorer, you can 
compress a large audio file before attaching it to an email message. The 
recipient of the compressed files will have to unzip the file before listening 
to it, however.
Digital Audio file formats 
You can recognize a digital audio file by looking at its type or its file exten-
sion. For example, Thriller.mp3 is an audio file, not a music video.

	What type of software is required to work with digital audio 
files? To play a digital audio file, you must use some type of audio software. 
Whether you can use general-purpose audio software, a special-purpose 
player, or a browser plugin depends on the source and type of audio.
Audio software. General-purpose audio software and apps provide tools 
for recording, playing, and modifying audio files. Popular audio software 
includes iTunes, Windows Media Player, and Audacity.
Audio players. An audio player is a small standalone software applica-
tion or mobile app that offers tools for listening to digital audio and managing 
playlists, but may not provide tools for making your own recordings. Audio 
players might be included with your computer’s operating system, pack-
aged with your sound card, installed in a handheld device, or available on 
the Web. 
Audio plugins. An audio plugin is software that works in conjunction 
with your computer’s browser to manage and play audio that you are 
accessing from a Web page. Each audio plugin tends to work with only 
one audio format, so multiple plugins are necessary when you have audio 
files in several formats.
	Is streaming better than downloading? Some digital content, 
such as photos, must be accessed as a whole piece. Other media, such 
as audio and video, play back over a period of time. These media files can 
be acquired as a download, live stream, or on-demand stream (Figure 
1-13).
Download
A download transfers an audio or 
video file from a server to your 
local device. 
You can play back the file even 
when your device is not online. 
The file can be played with any 
compatible software or player.
Live stream
A live stream sends media from a 
server to your local device, where 
it is played, but not stored. 
This method is also known as 
Webcasting.
You have to be online while listen-
ing or watching.
The content stream cannot be 
paused, stored, or rewound. 
On-demand stream
An on-demand stream sends the 
media to your local device, where it 
is stored temporarily, or “buffered,” 
until there is enough data to begin 
playback. 
You can fast-forward to any point in 
the stream without waiting for the 
file to download.

SECTION B, Unit 1
	Can I convert audio files from one format to another? Imagine 
that you find a cool MIDI ring tone on the Web, but your iPhone won’t play 
MIDI music. Your audio software might provide tools for opening a file 
stored in one format and saving it in another format. If not, a quick Google 
search can provide links to free audio converters.
Suppose you inherit a stack of audio CDs. Using audio software, you can 
rip CD tracks into a format that’s supported by your iPod. Ripping is a slang 
term that refers to the process of importing tracks from a CD or DVD to your 
computer’s hard disk. The technical term for ripping music tracks is digital 
audio extraction. 
Music is stored on CDs in a digital format called CDDA. The format offers 
high fidelity; but one minute of CDDA music requires in excess of 10 MB of 
storage space. During the ripping process, music in CDDA format is con-
verted into a compressed format such as MP3, AAC, or WMA to reduce file 
size. 
One of the most versatile tools for converting audio files from one format to 
another and for ripping audio CDs is Apple iTunes software (Figure 1-14).

midi
Digital audio is a recording of real analog sound signals. In contrast, syn-
thesized sound is an artificially created, or synthetic, sound. The first music 
synthesizers were analog. When digital synthesizers became popular, MIDI 
was developed as a way to control them. 
	What is MIDI music? MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) 
specifies a standard way to store music data for synthesizers, electronic 
MIDI instruments, and computers. Unlike digital audio files, which contain 
digitized recordings of real performances, MIDI files contain instructions, 
called MIDI messages, specifying the pitch of a note, the point at which the 
note begins, the instrument that plays the note, the volume of the note, and 
the point at which the note ends. MIDI music is usually stored in .mid files.

	What is the data representation for a MIDI message? As with 
all digital data, MIDI messages are distilled into a series of bits represented 
by 1s and 0s. A MIDI message might look like this:

Which of the following files is 
likely to contain synthesized 
music?
a.	 Bongos.mp3
b.	 Screech.wav
c.	 Waltz.ogg
d.	 Sugar.mid
	What are the advantages and disadvantages of MIDI? MIDI 
files are much more compact than digital audio files. Depending on the 
exact piece of music, three ­minutes of MIDI music might require only 10 KB 
of storage space, whereas the same piece of music stored in a high-quality, 
noncompressed digital audio file might require 30 MB of storage space. 
One of the main disadvantages of MIDI is that it cannot produce vocals. 
Another disadvantage is that the quality of MIDI music depends on the play-
back device, which stores a collection of synthesized sounds. MIDI music 
might sound great on a computer equipped with high-end MIDI equipment, 
but the same MIDI sequence might sound artificial on a handheld device.
	Who uses MIDI? Today, MIDI is primarily a tool used by studio musi-
cians, performers, and composers. Musicians can input notes for several 
instrumental parts directly from a MIDI keyboard and create backup instru-
mentation for performances. One or two musicians with MIDI gear can 
sound like a large band. 
Music composition software with MIDI support makes it easy to place notes 
on a screen-based music staff, then play back the composition on a MIDI 
keyboard or through the speakers of a digital device (Figure 1-15).

SECTION b, Unit 1
DIGITIZED speech
Speech technologies are used to collect information from callers using 
telephone-based services such as Directory Assistance. They are the foun-
dation for interactive voice response systems such as Google Voice Search 
and Siri. Speech recognition enables people to control software with spo-
ken commands, as well as dictate text into a word processing document. 
Speech technologies can also read a computer screen aloud, which unlocks 
access to computers and the Internet for individuals with visual disabilities.
	What’s the difference between speech synthesis and speech 
recognition? Speech synthesis is the process by which machines pro-
duce sound that resembles spoken words. Speech recognition (or voice 
recognition) refers to the ability of a machine to understand spoken words. 
	How does speech synthesis work? A basic sound unit, such as 
“reh” or “gay,” is called a phoneme. Most speech synthesizers string 
together phonemes to form words. For example, the phonemes “reh” and 
“gay” produce the word “reggae.” Phonemes are usually derived from 
recordings of human voices reading specially prepared passages of text. 
Text-to-speech software analyzes the words in a section of text, finds 
corresponding phonemes, and combines them into sentences for output.
	How does speech recognition work? On a personal computer 
or smartphone, a speech recognition system collects words spoken into a 
microphone that’s connected to sound processing circuitry. This circuitry’s 
analog-to-digital converter transforms the analog sound of your voice into 
digital data. This data is then processed by speech recognition software.
Speech recognition software analyzes the sounds of your voice and con-
verts each word into groups of phonemes. Next, the software compares 
the groups of phonemes to the words in a digital dictionary that lists pho-
neme combinations along with their corresponding English (or French, 
Spanish, and so on) words. When a match is found, the software can dis-
play the word on the screen or use it to carry out a command. Most digital 
devices offer a way to use spoken commands (Figure 1-16).

bitmap basics
As digital devices gained the ability to display images, two types of com-
puter graphics evolved: bitmap and vector. Of the two, bitmap graphics are 
the most common, though not the most flexible. To find out why, let’s take a 
look at the characteristics of bitmaps.
	What is a bitmap graphic? A bitmap graphic, also called a ras-
ter graphic or simply a bitmap, is composed of a grid of tiny rectangular 
cells. Each cell is a picture element, commonly called a pixel. Each pixel is 
assigned a color, which is stored as a binary number. Figure 1-18 illustrates 
these basic characteristics of a bitmap graphic.

	Where would I encounter bitmap graphics? Bitmap graph-
ics are used to create realistic images, such as photographs. You might 
also encounter bitmaps in the form of ­cartoons, images that appear in 
computer games, the desktop images displayed by your computer or 
smartphone, and rendered images ­produced by 3-D graphics software. 
When you use a digital camera or camera-enabled cell phone, your pho-
tos are stored as bitmaps. A scanner produces bitmaps. The photos you 
send or receive as email attachments are bitmaps, as are most Web 
page graphics.

SECTION c, Unit 1
	How do I create bitmap images? You can create a bitmap graphic 
from scratch using the tools provided by graphics software—specifically a 
category of graphics software referred to as paint software. You might be 
familiar with paint software such as Adobe Photoshop, iPhoto (included with 
Apple computers), and Microsoft Paint (included with Windows). 
	How do I convert a printed image into a bitmap? When you 
have a printed image, such as a photograph, a page from a magazine, or 
a picture from a book, you can use a scanner to convert the printed image 
into a bitmap graphic. 
A scanner essentially divides an image into a fine grid of cells and assigns a 
digital value for the color of each cell. As the scan ­progresses, these values 
are transferred to your digital device and stored as a bitmap graphics file. 
Scanners, such as the one pictured in Figure 1-19, are inexpensive and 
easy to use.
	How does a digital camera capture bitmap images? The lens 
of a film camera captures the light from an image onto a light-sensitive roll 
of film, which is developed to produce a photographic print. In a digital 
camera, the lens focuses light from the image onto a small image sensor 
called a CCD (charge-coupled device). A CCD contains a grid of tiny light-
sensitive diodes called photosites. 
The number of photosites depends on the 
size of the CCD. A one-half-inch square CCD 
can contain more than 500,000 photosites. 
Each photosite detects the brightness and 
color for its tiny piece of the image (Figure 
1-20).
A CCD’s photosites correspond to pixels. 
The more pixels used to capture an image, 
the higher its resolution, and the better the 
resulting picture. Cameras with larger CCDs 
produce higher quality images. Some cam-
eras contain multiple CCDs, which enhance 
the color quality of a camera’s output.
Figure 1-20: Camera Capture
A digital camera’s CCD converts 
the image captured by the 
camera lens into a grid of col-
ored pixels, which are stored 
as bits. 
CCD
Figure 1-19: Scan Images
To scan an image, turn on the scanner 
and start your scanner software. Place 
the image face down on the scanner 
glass, then use the scanner software 
to initiate the scan. The scanned image 
is saved in memory and can then be 
saved on your computer’s hard disk or 
in another storage location.

Figure 1-21: Bitmap Formats 
Bitmap Format
Use
BMP, pronounced “bee-em-pee” or “bump,” is the native 
bitmap graphics file format of the Microsoft Windows 
environment. Microsoft Paint, included as part of Microsoft 
Windows, creates BMP graphics files. The BMP format 
supports True Color and can be used for a wide variety of 
graphics applications, such as photographs, illustrations, 
and graphs. BMP files are often too large for email attach-
ments. BMP graphics are not supported by most browsers, 
so they are not used on the Web.
Graphical elements, 
such as buttons and 
other controls for 
graphical user inter-
faces
RAW image formats contain the unprocessed pixel data 
generated directly by a digital camera’s sensor. Up to 
12 bits of data can be stored for each of the red, blue, 
and green values for a pixel, so RAW files are very large. 
Cameras that offer a RAW format also supply proprietary 
software to convert RAW data to JPEG or TIFF.
Photographic images 
before they are stored 
in other formats
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format), or TIF, is a flexible and 
platform-independent graphics file format supported by 
most photoediting software packages. Scanners and digital 
cameras commonly store bitmaps in TIFF format because it 
­supports True Color and can be easily converted into other 
graphics file formats. 
Desktop publishing 
and any projects 
that require high-
resolution graphics; 
not supported by 
browsers
JPEG (pronounced “JAY-peg”), which stands for Joint 
Photographic Experts Group, is a graphics format with 
built-in compression that stores True Color bitmap data 
very efficiently in a small file. The JPEG format is popular 
for Web graphics and for photos attached to email mes-
sages. When creating a JPEG or converting an image to 
JPEG format, you can control the level of compression and 
the resulting file size. The compression process eliminates 
some image data, however, so highly compressed files suf-
fer some quality deterioration. 
General use, such as 
desktop publishing 
or Web pages, where 
flexibility in file size is 
important
GIF (Graphics Interchange Format), pronounced “gif” or 
“jiff,” was specifically designed to create images that can be 
displayed on multiple platforms, such as PCs and Macs. GIF 
graphics are limited to 256 colors, but the format supports 
simple animations. Once a popular format for Web pages, 
GIF is being replaced by JPEG and PNG.
Web graphics and 
simple animations
PNG (Portable Network Graphics), pronounced “ping,” is a 
graphics format designed to improve on the GIF format. A 
PNG graphic can display up to 48-bit True Color (trillions of 
colors). Unlike JPEG, PNG compresses bitmap files without 
losing any data, so compressed images retain the same 
high quality as the originals. PNG was developed as a public 
domain format without any restrictions on its use.

other general uses

	What are the most common bitmap file formats? Cameras, 
scanners, and graphics software may offer a choice of bitmap formats, such 
as BMP, RAW, TIFF, JPEG, GIF, and PNG. Selecting the best graphics file 
format to use depends on what you intend to do with the image. Figure 1-21 
summarizes popular bitmap formats and their uses.

bitmap DATA REPRESENTATION
The fact that bitmap images are formed by a grid of pixels controls not 
only how those images are stored, but also how they can be modified. 
Color and resolution are key elements in bitmap data representation.
	How does each pixel get a color number? Today’s color display 
devices represent color using the RGB color model. The color displayed 
for a pixel is based on the intensity of red, green, and blue signals received 
by the screen’s color elements. 
Each red, green, and blue signal is assigned a value ranging from 0 to 255: 
0 represents the absence of color, and 255 represents the highest intensity 
level for that color. A pixel appears white if the red, green, and blue signals 
are set to maximum intensity. If red, green, and blue signals are equal but 
at a lower intensity, the pixel displays a shade of gray. A pixel appears violet 
if it receives high red and blue signals and just a bit of green (Figure 1-22).
	How are colors specified? Color values can be specified in decimal 
(base 10), hexadecimal (base 16), or binary (base 2). Even artists need to 
know their way around number systems! Decimal notation tends to be used 
within graphics software, and hexadecimal (hex) notation is common on the 
Web. Whichever notation is used, however, color data is ultimately repre-
sented as binary digits when it is stored and transmitted.
In decimal, a pixel color is specified with values such as Red 238, Green 
130, and Blue 238. In hexadecimal, each pair of digits refers to a color 
value. For example, the hexadecimal number for violet is #EE82EE. That 
means EE(hex) = 238 Red, 82(hex) = 130 Green, and EE(hex) = 238 Blue. 
You can find lists of colors and their hexadecimal triplets on the Web. In 
binary, eight bits are used to represent the red value, another eight bits are 
used for the green value, and eight more bits are used for blue.
	How much data is required for each pixel color? With eight bits 
used to represent each color value, one pixel requires 24 bits. Because 
each R, G, and B can have 256 values, the number of possible colors is 
16.7 million (256 x 256 x 256). The number of colors available in a graphic 
is referred to as color depth. Images that use 24 bits for each pixel have a 
color depth of 24. 24-bit color depth is also called True Color.

Terminology
The CMYK color model defines 
four color values: cyan, 
magenta, yellow, and black. It is 
a subtractive system, whereas 
RGB is an additive system. In 
CMYK, white is 00000000; but 
in RGB, 11111111 is white. 
CMYK is typically used for 
projects that require color 
printing.

bitmap RESOLUTION
The dimensions of the grid that forms a bitmap graphic are referred to as 
image resolution. The resolution of a bitmap is usually expressed as the 
number of horizontal and vertical pixels it ­contains. For example, a small 
graphic for a Web page might have a resolution of 150 x 100 pixels—150 
pixels across and 100 pixels high.
	How does resolution relate to image quality? High-resolution 
graphics contain more data than low-resolution graphics. With more data, 
it is possible to display and print high-quality images that are sharper and 
clearer than images produced using less data. 
	Can I shrink and enlarge bitmaps? Bitmap graphics are resolution 
dependent because each element is a discrete pixel. Imagine that a bitmap 
image and its grid come on a surface that you can stretch or shrink. As you 
stretch the surface, the grid maintains the same number of horizontal and 
vertical cells, but each cell becomes larger, the grid becomes more visible, 
and the image develops an undesirable jagged appearance referred to as 
pixelation. Simply stretching a bitmap to enlarge it doesn’t produce high-
quality results (Figure 1-23).
	Can I change a bitmap’s resolution? Graphics software offers 
options for changing the resolution of bitmap images. Suppose you reduce 
the resolution from 2160 x 1440 to 1080 x 720. The image grid becomes 
a quarter of its original size, but every fourth pixel was removed from the 
image, which typically reduces image quality.
If you attempt to enlarge a bitmap by increasing its resolution, your com-
puter must somehow add pixels because no additional picture data exists. 
But what colors should these additional pixels become? Most graphics soft-
ware uses a process called pixel interpolation to create new pixels by 
averaging the colors of nearby pixels. 
For some images, pixel interpolation produces an enlargement that appears 
very similar to the original. Other images—particularly those with strong 
curved or diagonal lines—may appear pixelated. 
	So how much resolution does a bitmap need to be printed 
as a poster? Graphics software, such as Adobe Photoshop, can help 
you gauge how large an image can be printed before the quality begins 
to deteriorate. The minimum resolution 
for printed output is 72 pixels per inch 
(ppi). A photo taken with an iPhone has a 
resolution of 1936 x 2592. At 72 ppi, the 
photo can be printed up to a size of 26" x 
36". 
To print the same photo but with a better 
resolution of 150 ppi, the poster would be 
much smaller: about 12" x 17" as shown 
in Figure 1-24. 
Figure 1-24: Image Size 
Check these specifications to 
determine maximum print 
size.
Figure 1-23: Pixelation 
The enlargement of this bal-
loon appears pixelated because 
it was a small part of a photo 
that had few pixels. 
Open an image with Photoshop 
or similar graphics software. 
Check its size and its ppi. At 300 
ppi, how large can the image be 
printed before its quality begins 
to deteriorate?
Try It!
Resampling an image requires 
pixel interpolation and may 
decrease the image quality. To 
maintain quality, do not resample.

SECTION c, Unit 1
Image compression
Bitmap files are big. An image with a resolution of 1936 x 2592 contains 
5,018,112 pixels. Each pixel requires 24 bits, so the RAW image file could 
be as large as 120,434,688 bits (12,434,696 bytes or 12 megabytes). By 
any measure, that’s a lot of data to store and move. Various image com-
pression techniques can be used to shrink bitmap files.
	What is image compression? Image compression refers to any 
technique that recodes the data in an image file so that it contains fewer 
bits. Many bitmap file formats automatically apply compression to an image 
when it is saved.
	Which formats apply lossless compression? TIFF, PNG, and GIF 
graphics formats offer lossless ­compression. Images stored in these for-
mats do not lose any quality when compressed.
	How does lossless compression shrink a file without throw-
ing away data? Various techniques exist for lossless image compression. 
As a simple example, consider a type of lossless compression called run-
length encoding. Run-length encoding (RLE) replaces a series of similarly 
colored pixels with a binary code that indicates the number of pixels and 
their colors. 
Suppose that a section of a picture has 167 consecutive white pixels, and 
each pixel is described by three bytes of data. RLE compresses this series 
of 167 bytes into as few as four bytes, as shown in Figure 1-25.
The data for the first 167 white 
pixels can be compressed as 
10100111 11111111 11111111 
11111111. The first byte is the 
binary representation of 167. 
The next three bytes are the 
code for white.

	Which formats apply lossless compression? JPEG files are com-
pressed using lossy compression, so some quality is lost when the file is 
saved. When saving an image as a JPEG, you may be able to select a com-
pression level. Take care with lossy compression to ensure that your image 
is not further compressed every time you save it (Figure 1-26). 
	Can I compress images using general compression tools? The 
same compression tools used to shrink text and numeric data can be used 
with bitmaps. Images stored in file formats such as JPEG and PNG, which 
are automatically compressed, may not shrink much, whereas RAW files, 
BMPs, and noncompressed TIFFs may shrink quite a bit.
Figure 1-27: Compressed image quality
Non-compressed JPEG image

	What happens during lossy compression? Lossy compression 
techniques discard some data from an image to shrink its file size. JPEG is 
a lossy version of run-length encoding that can be applied to images, such 
as photographs, that don’t have large areas of solid color. 
A True Color photograph might not have any adjoining pixels of the same 
color. Applying RLE to such a photo would not result in any compression 
whatsoever. JPEG preprocesses an image by tweaking the colors in adjoin-
ing pixels so that they are the same color whenever possible. After this 
preprocessing is complete, run-length encoding can be applied with more 
success. 
For many images, lossy compression results in only a minor reduction in 
the sharpness of the image. The reduction in quality can be unnoticeable in 
many circumstances. Figure 1-27 illustrates a section of a noncompressed 
image and a section of that same image after JPEG compression has been 
applied. Can you see any difference?

SECTION c, Unit 1
Modifying Bitmap Images
“Photoshopping” has become an everyday term for fixing up photos that 
are underexposed, are marred by red eye effects, or display an awkward 
object in the background. Photoshop software and a host of local and 
online apps make it easy to modify digital images. 
	What characteristics of a bitmap can I modify? Because bit-
map graphics are coded as a series of bits that represent pixels, you can 
use graphics software to modify or edit this type of graphic by changing the 
color of pixels. 
In the early days of digital imaging, primitive photoediting was limited to 
changing the color of individual pixels, or roughly cropping out objects to 
delete them or paste them elsewhere. 
Today, photoediting software includes sophisticated tools based on graph-
ics algorithms that produce amazing transformations of digital images. 
Knowing how to use the available toolset can improve the images you pro-
duce. Understanding the extent to which photos can be edited also builds 
awareness of the “tricks” that can be used to alter images in news stories 
and other information sources. 
Noise reduction. In an image, “noise” refers to artifacts such as spots, 
dust, and scratches that may be produced when old photos are scanned. 
Some images have undesirable speckles resulting from low light conditions. 
Noise reduction tools can remove these noisy artifacts.
Image enhancement. A mediocre photo can benefit from image enhance-
ment techniques that correct brightness, improve color saturation, and 
sharpen the focus. Beyond one-click enhancement tools, image editors 
provide an image histogram that can be used to adjust the brightness val-
ues for various ranges of dark, mid-range, or light pixels (Figure 1-28).
Figure 1-28: How image histograms work 
The histogram for the original photo shows 
lots of dark pixels (the buildings) and a few 
light ones (the sunset).
By sliding the Levels bar, more pixels 
become mid-range and the details of 
the buildings begin to emerge.

Selective color change. The mannequin at an online store displays a 
red dress, which is also available in other colors. How would it look in blue? 
The photographer did not have to take a photo of the dress in every color. 
Photoediting software can outline the dress in the original photo and then 
apply the new color. Similar algorithms are used to colorize black and white 
photos.
Correcting image distortion. The human eye compensates for per-
spective, but the camera does not. When a rectangular object in a photo 
appears distorted, reconstructing the straight edges is easy with photo edit-
ing software (Figure 1-29).
Cloning. Cloning employs algorithms that pull pixels from one area of an 
image and then apply them to another area. Cloning can be used to remove 
small blemishes as shown in Figure 1-30. 
Figure 1-29: Correcting image distortion 
Figure 1-31: Inpainting with content-aware fill 
Inpainting. Reconstructing lost, unwanted, or deteriorated areas in a 
photo is called inpainting. Using information from nearby pixels, and tak-
ing into account the overall structure of the image, inpainting algorithms 
essentially scrub out designated areas and miraculously replace the miss-
ing pixels with a background or an object that fits with the rest of the image 
(Figure 1-31).

Cloning works well to 
remove natural blemishes 
and photo artifacts, such 
as the white spot under

Removing the man leaves a blank area.
Photoshop’s Content-Aware Fill algorithm creates a

Digital compositing. Have you seen the photo of a great white shark 
attacking a U.S. Air Force helicopter? That image and many more bizarre 
photos are a product of digital compositing, which assembles several 
images into one. Compositing is achieved using two tools: clipping paths 
and alpha blending. 
A clipping path essentially cuts an object out of an image and knocks out 
the background to make it transparent. This object can then be superim-
posed on a background. Alpha blending alters the pixel colors where the 
edges of the object and the background meet, so that the object appears to 
merge with the background (Figure 1-32).

SECTION d, Unit 1
	What is a vector graphic? A vector graphic consists of a set of 
instructions for creating a picture. Instead of storing the color value for each 
pixel, a vector graphics file ­contains instructions that a computer uses to 
create the shape, size, position, and color for each object in an image. 
Vector drawing instructions are similar to those a drafting teacher might 
give students: “Draw a line of width 3 beginning at screen coordinates 20, 
20 and extend the line to screen coordinates 20, 60. Color the line with 
#00BF00 (green).” 
The command in “computerese” using an XML script would be:
<line x1 = “20” y1 = “20” x2 = “20” y2 = “60” stroke = “#00BF00” stroke-width = “3”/>
Vector graphics include standard shapes such as circles and rectangles, 
so they don’t have to be built from scratch. The green square in Figure 1-33 
was created by specifying a rectangle beginning at coordinates 100,100 
with a width of 400 and a height of 400, filled with #00BF00, like this:
   <rect x = “100” y = “100” width = “400” height = “400” fill = “#00BF00”/>

The first graphics that appeared on computer screens were not photos, but 
simple shapes consisting of lines and curves, each referred to as a vector. 
This type of graphic evolved in sophistication as the shapes became filled, 
then shaded, and then textured (Figure 1-33).

	How do vector graphics compare with bitmap images? 
Because vector graphics are based on commands, they have different char-
acteristics than bitmap images, which are stored as a collection of colored 
pixels. The differences between the two are important when considering 
which is best for specific projects.
Vector graphics resize better than bitmaps. When you change the 
size of a vector graphic, the objects change proportionally and maintain 
their smooth edges. In contrast, bitmap graphics might appear to have jag-
ged edges after they are enlarged, as shown in Figure 1-34.
Vector graphic at 200% (above) and 
50% (left)
Bitmap graphic at 200% (above) 
and 50% (right)
Figure 1-34: Vector images do not pixelate when enlarged 
Vector graphics usually require less storage space than bitmaps. 
The storage space required for a vector graphic reflects the complexity 
of the image. Each instruction requires storage space; so the more lines, 
shapes, and fill patterns in the graphic, the more storage space it requires. 
The Stonehenge vector graphic used as an example in this unit requires 
less than 4 KB of storage space. A True Color photograph of the same 
image requires 1,109 KB.
Vector graphics are not usually as realistic as bitmap images. 
Many 2-D vector images have a flat, cartoon-like appearance instead of the 
realistic appearance you expect from a photograph. This cartoon-like char-
acteristic of vector images results from the use of objects filled with blocks 
of color. 
It is easier to edit an object in a vector graphic than an object in 
a bitmap graphic. A vector graphic is like a collage of objects that can be 
layered over each other, but moved and edited independently. Figure 1-35 
illustrates the difference between vector and bitmap graphics when you try 
to edit out parts of the Stonehenge image.
Figure 1-35: Vector objects are layered 
Stones in this vector image are in a separate layer 
that can easily be removed.
A bitmap graphic is not layered, so without an inpainting 
algorithm, removing the stones leaves a hole.

SECTION d, Unit 1
	Where are vector graphics used? Vector graphics are suitable for 
most line art, logos, simple illustrations, infographic elements, and diagrams 
that might be displayed and printed at various sizes. Vector graphics can 
include text, which is easily editable and scalable. Most modern fonts are 
created from vectors because they can scale smoothly to large sizes. Font 
effects for WordArt are based on vectors. Vector graphics are also used for 
floor plans, engineering diagrams, and spreadsheet charts because they 
are constructed from simple lines and shapes (Figure 1-36). 
	How can I identify vector graphics? It can be tricky to accurately 
identify a vector graphic just by looking at an on-screen image. Some have 
a flat, cartoon-like quality, but others can look fairly realistic. Also remem-
ber that not all bitmap graphics are photos. Bitmaps are used for on-screen 
icons, and a bitmap could consist of simple blocks of color that look like 
vector shapes.
For a more definitive identification, check the file type or extension. Vector 
graphics files have file extensions such as .wmf, .ai, .dxf, .eps, .swf, and 
.svg. SVG is the most popular format for Web-based vector graphics. 
Vector images created by combin-
ing shapes can look primitive.
More sophisticated vector images 
are created by outlining paths 
drawn from one point to another.
Fonts are also created using  
outlines and curves.
Combining circles and other 
simple shapes with outlined 
shapes produces clip art–images.
Charts combine simple 
shapes and text.
Floor plans merge shapes and text.

vector Tools 
Neither scanners nor digital cameras produce vector graphics. Architects 
and engineers might use a digitizing tablet to turn a paper-based line 
drawing into a vector graphic. A digitizing tablet (sometimes called a 2-D 
digitizer) is a device that provides a flat surface for a paper-based draw-
ing and a pen or mouse-like puck that you can use to click the endpoints 
of each line on the drawing. The endpoints are converted into vectors and 
stored.
	What tools do I need to create vector graphics? Vector 
graphics are created from scratch with vector graphics software, referred to 
as drawing software. Popular drawing software includes Adobe Illustrator, 
LibreOffice Draw, and open source Inkscape. There are also numerous 
online vector drawing apps; just search for “vector drawing.” 
Vector graphics software provides an array of drawing tools that you can 
use to create objects, position them, and fill them with colors, gradients, or 
patterns. The software converts the items you draw into the instructions that 
are stored, which can be later used to recreate your drawing. Figure 1-37 
illustrates how to use drawing tools to create a vector graphic.

SECTION d, Unit 1
	Is it possible to convert a vector graphic into a bitmap? A 
vector graphic can be converted quite easily into a bitmap graphic through 
a process called rasterizing. Rasterization works by superimposing a grid 
over a vector image and determining the color for each pixel. This process 
can be carried out by graphics software, which allows you to specify the 
output size for the final bitmap image. 
On a PC, you can rasterize a vector graphic 
by using the Print Screen (PrtSc) key to take 
a screenshot of a vector image. On a Mac, the 
Command-Shift-3 key combination takes a 
screenshot. It is important to rasterize images 
at the size you ultimately need. If you rasterize 
a vector image at a small size and then try to 
enlarge the resulting bitmap image, you will likely 
get a poor-quality pixelated image, such as the 
one in Figure 1-38.
After a vector graphic is converted to a bitmap, 
the resulting graphic no longer has the qualities 
of a vector graphic. For example, if you convert 
the Stonehenge vector graphic into a bitmap, the 
sun is no longer an object that you can easily 
move or assign a different color. 
3-D graphics
	How do vector graphics relate to 3-D graphics? 3-D graphics 
are based on vectors stored as a set of instructions describing the coordi-
nates for lines and shapes in a three-dimensional space. The vectors form 
a wireframe that acts in much the same way as the framework of a pop-up 
tent. Just as you would ­construct the framework for the tent and then cover 
it with a nylon tent cover, a 3-D wireframe can be covered with surface tex-
ture and color to create a graphic of a 3-D object. 
The process of covering a wireframe with surface color and texture is called 
rendering. The rendering process requires a computer to perform inten-
sive calculations to determine the surface dimensions between vectors. 
Rendering outputs a bitmap image that can be displayed on the screen or 
printed (Figure 1-39).

For added realism, the rendering process can take into account the way 
that light shines on surfaces and creates shadows. The technique for add-
ing light and shadows to a 3-D image is called ray tracing. 
Before an image is rendered, the artist selects a location for one or more 
light sources. The computer applies a complex mathematical algorithm to 
determine how the light source affects the color of each pixel in the final 
rendered image. Figure 1-40 shows the image from the ­previous figure ren-
dered with an additional light source and ray tracing.

SECTION d, Unit 1
	Is it possible to animate 3-D 
graphics? 3-D graphics can be animated 
to produce special effects for movies or to 
create interactive, animated ­characters and 
environments for 3-D computer games. 
In traditional hand-drawn animation, a chief 
artist draws the keyframes, and then a 
team of assistants creates each of the in-
between images—24 of these images for 
each second of animation. For 3-D com-
puter animation, the computer creates the 
in-between images by moving the object 
and rendering each necessary image. All 
the images are then combined into a single 
file, creating essentially a digital movie. 
	Do game and movie anima-
tion require similar tools and 
techniques? An important characteristic of special effects and animated 
films is that rendering can be accomplished during the production phase 
of a movie and incorporated into the final footage. In contrast, 3-D com-
puter game animation happens in real time as the computer turns the vector 
instructions into points of light on the screen (Figure 1-42). Each frame 
is rendered while you are playing the game—a process that requires an 
incredible amount of processing power. 
To give you a handle on the immensity of the processing power required to 
render the real-time images for computer games, consider a classic game 
like Doom that is displayed on a screen set at 1,600 x 900 resolution. At this 
resolution, the screen contains 1,440,000 pixels (1,600 multiplied by 900). If 
the game is presented in 24-bit color, each frame of the animation requires 
34,560,000 bits. 
Computer game designers believe that on-screen animation looks smooth-
est at 60 frames per second, which means your computer must handle 
2,073,600,000 bits—that’s more than 2 billion bits of information every sec-
ond just to display the 3-D image on the screen.

SECTION e, Unit 1
digital video basics
A video is a series of still images projected at a rate fast enough to fool 
the human eye into perceiving continuous motion. Video technology for 
movies and television was exclusively analog until 1986, when Sony intro-
duced a digital video format stored on videocassette tapes. In 1991, Apple 
introduced a digital video format for computers. Microsoft followed with a 
competing digital video format in 1992. 
	What is digital video? Digital video uses bits to store color and 
brightness data for each video frame. The process is similar to storing the 
data for a series of bitmap images in which the color for each pixel is repre-
sented by a binary number.
	Where does digital video footage originate? You can shoot 
footage for digital video with a consumer-quality camcorder, webcam, or 
cell phone camera. Footage can also originate from television, a DVD, or 
even a digital video recording device. 
Analog footage from Super 8 home movies, VHS videotapes, and other 
legacy sources can be digitized using video capture equipment. During 
digitization, each frame of the original footage is isolated and divided into 
a gridwork of pixels. Each pixel is assigned a color number that is repre-
sented by a string of bits. This raw data can then be stored in any popular 
digital video format (Figure 1-43).
Figure 1-43: Video Capture
	How is digital video used? You can use your personal computer 
and video editing software to produce videos suitable for a variety of per-
sonal and professional uses, such as video wedding albums, product sales 
videos, training videos, video holiday greeting cards, documentaries for 
nonprofit organizations, and video scrapbooks. 
Digital video technology is also used in the motion picture industry, where 
digital cinematography captures moving images as bits, rather than on 
film. Digital cinematography and editing have been used for many award-
winning films, such as Cold Mountain, Slumdog Millionaire, and The Social 
Network. 
Digital video is a core technology for digital television, videoconferencing 
systems, and video messaging. Real-time video even allows deaf people to 
sign over cell phones. 
The analog video plays 
on a film projector or 
other analog device.
The digital data is 
relayed to a computer 
storage device.
The video capture device 
digitizes each frame by 
assigning color numbers 
to each pixel.

	What are the key properties of digital video? Anyone can point 
a smartphone, shoot a few seconds of video, and upload it to YouTube. The 
likely result is video containing grainy images, poor lighting, and unintelligi-
ble sound. Achieving better quality and creating video for more widespread 
use requires a bit of background information. 
The quality of digital video is based on several factors, including frame rate, 
resolution, color depth, bit depth, bit rate, compression technique, and file 
format. 
	What should I know about frame rate? Digital video displays bit-
map images in rapid succession. Each bitmap image is referred to as a 
frame. The number of frames that are displayed per second is the frame 
rate (fps). Higher frame rates produce video that more smoothly simulates 
real motion. The standard frame rate for motion pictures was set in the 
1930s before digital formats. Digital video can produce higher frame rates 
(Figure 1-44). 
	How does resolution affect video quality? Each frame is essen-
tially a bitmap image with a resolution determined by the frame’s width and 
height. A frame with 640 x 480 resolution contains 307,200 bits (multiply 
640 by 480). 
A video with a frame size of 640 x 480 will fill the screen of a device that has 
a similar screen size, mapping each pixel in the video frame to each pixel 
on the screen. Stretching the video to fit a larger screen requires pixel inter-
polation, which tends to reduce the quality of the image.
Modern projection devices and video playback software do an admirable 
job of upconverting, which is the digital video term for interpolation. As a 
rule, however, videos look sharpest when they are displayed at a resolution 
that is the same as the frame size.

SECTION e, Unit 1
	How is resolution expressed? Video resolutions can be expressed 
as width x height, as the horizontal resolution, or as the vertical resolution. 
Cameras used for digital cinematography capture video with a resolution of 
2048 x 1536. That resolution is also referred to as 2K because the horizon-
tal resolution is about 2,000 pixels. 
A resolution of 1920 x 1080 can also be expressed using its vertical 
resolution as 1080p. The “p” means progressive scan, in which the frame is 
drawn line by line in sequence from the top of the image to the bottom. An 
interlaced scan is a contrasting scanning technique that produces an image 
by drawing every other line, then going back and filling in the in-between 
lines. Digital video for computers typically uses progressive scanning, 
whereas digital television uses interlaced scanning (Figure 1-45).
1080p
1080i
Figure 1-45: Progressive or interlaced? 
	What about aspect ratio? When 1080p specifies resolution, the ver-
tical resolution is determined by the frame’s aspect ratio. Aspect ratio is 
the proportional relation between the width and height of an image or video 
frame. 
Before widescreen cinema became popular in the 1960s, 4:3 was the stan-
dard aspect ratio for television and old movies. It was also the aspect ratio 
of early digital videos produced for 4:3 screens on the first generation of 
personal computers. iPads use the 4:3 aspect ratio, as well.
Today’s widescreen devices, such as laptops and smartphones, are 
designed for the 16:9 aspect ratio, which is recommended for most modern 
videos, including those uploaded to YouTube. 
When 4:3 videos are displayed in a widescreen player, they are bordered 
by the black bars of a letterbox (Figure 1-46).
Figure 1-46: Letterboxes 
The video on the left has a 
16:9 aspect ratio that fits into 
the YouTube player window. 
The video on the right has a 
4:3 aspect ratio. A letterbox 
creates black bars to fill the 
playback window.

	How does resolution relate to aspect ratio? As long as the pro-
portion of horizontal and vertical pixels remains the same, the aspect ratio 
is consistent. For example, a video frame with 1280 x 720 resolution has an 
aspect ratio of 16:9, as does a video with a resolution of 3840 x 2160. Both 
videos fit in a widescreen playback window, but the video with higher reso-
lution offers a sharper, higher quality image.
The math: Divide the horizontal by the vertical resolution. If the result is 1.7, 
then the aspect ratio is 16:9. If the result is 1.3, then the aspect ratio is 4:3. 
Try it yourself with the resolutions in Figure 1-47.
	How does color depth affect video quality? Recall from earlier 
in the unit that color depth refers to the number and variety of colors that 
can be used in an image. 24-bit color depth offers a palette of 16.7 mil-
lion colors. A wide selection of colors produces realistic digital videos, but 
requires lots of space to store all the bits for every frame. 
Let’s use 1920 x 1080 as a typical resolution. The number of pixels in the 
frame is 2,073,600 (multiply 1920 x 1080). When each pixel requires 24 bits 
to define its color, 49,766,400 bits are required for the data in one frame.
Now take into consideration the video frame rate of 24 fps. How much data 
is required for one second of video? 1,194,393,600 bits! And for one minute 
of video? 71,663,616,000. That’s more than 71 billion bits! You can see how 
the bits stack up for a two-hour movie by multiplying 71 billion by 120 min-
utes. A feature-length video requires an astounding 8,599,633,920,000 bits. 
Yes, more than eight trillion bits, or one trillion bytes.

SECTION e, Unit 1
	Are digital devices powerful enough to handle all those bits? 
When working with digital video, you can’t escape bit rates. You might have 
to specify a bit rate when you save a video, or when you convert a video 
from one format to another.
Bit rate is the number of bits that are processed during a specific unit of 
time, usually during one second. Bit rate can be expressed as bits per sec-
ond (b/sec or bps), kilobits per second (Kbit/s or Kbps), and so on.
Bit rate becomes more important than file size for streaming video because 
it indicates how many bits must be transferred per second for the video to 
play smoothly without pausing to refill the buffer. To determine the bit rate 
for our 1920 x 1080 video, we have to find out how many bits are required 
for one second of video. We did that on the previous page, but here is the 
math:
1920 x 1080 x 24  x 24 = 1,194,393,600
resolution  x color depth x fps = bits per second   
1,194,393,600 bits per second would usually be expressed as 1.19 Gbps. 
That bit rate is far too high for today’s network connections. A fast cable 
Internet connection maxes out at 50 Mbps, so it can handle megabytes of 
data each second, but not gigabytes of data.
The bit rate for this video must decrease or it will stutter and pause fre-
quently as it is watched. To reduce the bit rate, digital videos can be 
compressed.
Video Compression
Bit rate can be scaled down by reducing the resolution and applying com-
pression techniques. 
	How can I reduce resolution? When saving a video or embedding 
it in a Web page, you may have a choice of resolutions. Choosing a lower 
resolution reduces the bit rate (Figure 1-48).

	How does video compression work? Although reducing the frame 
size can affect bit rate, it does not produce acceptable bit rates without more 
reductions. That’s where compression plays a role. Compression removes 
some of the data through techniques such as image compression and inter-
frame compression.
Image compression. Earlier in the unit, you found out how still images are 
compressed using lossy and lossless compression. This type of intraframe 
compression can be applied to each frame of a video. Suppose the data 
for each frame of a 1920 x 1080 video can be compressed by a factor of 10 
from 49,766,400 bits to 50,000 bits. The resulting bit rate is 1.2 Mbps, which 
is suitable for most Internet connections. 
Interframe compression. Two frames in a sequence often contain many 
similarly colored pixels, especially if the background remains unchanged. 
Interframe compression stores only the pixels that change color from one 
frame to the next. More sophisticated interframe compression uses motion 
compensation to track along with the camera, essentially following the cam-
era movement to gain additional similarities between frames.	
Video compression can be expressed as a compression ratio, which indi-
cates the ratio of compressed data to noncompressed data. A video file with 
a high compression ratio, such as 35:1, has more compression, a smaller 
file size, and lower image quality than a file with a smaller compression 
ratio, such as 5:1. 
	How can I specify a compression level? Some entry-level video 
editing software allows you to select a use for your video, such as sending it 
as an email attachment, posting it on the Web, publishing it on YouTube, or 
viewing it from your local hard disk. The software automatically applies an 
appropriate level of compression to the video data (Figure 1-49).
QuickCheck
Which compression ratio 
produces the best quality video?
a.	 2:1
b.	 5:1
c.	 10:1
d.	 35:1
Figure 1-49: Compression according to use 
Alternatively, your software might offer the option of selecting a maximum 
file size. For example, if you are planning to send a video as an email 
attachment, you might limit the size to 1 MB, and your video data will be 
compressed to that specified size.
Some video editing software allows you to select a bit rate for your final 
video. YouTube allows bit rates up to 40 Mbps. The recommended YouTube 
bit rate, however, is 8 Kbps for 1080p resolution. Facebook recommends a 
bit rate of 700–1,000 Kbps.
When saving a video with 
iMovie, selecting a destination 
provides formats compatible 
with iMovie, email, iTunes, 
YouTube, and other popular 
file sharing sites.

SECTION e, Unit 1
	Where does the compression come from? A codec (compres-
sor/decompressor) is the software that compresses a video stream when a 
video is stored, and decompresses the file when the video is played. 
Each codec uses a unique algorithm to shrink the size of a video file, so 
they are not interchangeable. A file compressed using one codec cannot be 
extracted and played using a different codec.
When creating videos, you should use one of the codecs included in popular 
video players. Popular codecs include MPEG, VP8, DivX, H.264, Theora, 
and Windows Media Video. 
Video File Formats
Video files are stored in container formats that hold the compressed video 
stream and an audio stream. For example, the popular MP4 container for-
mat holds a video stream that was produced with the H.264 codec and an 
AAC audio stream (Figure 1-50). 
	What are popular video container formats? Figure 1-51 
describes some popular video container formats: AVI, MOV, MPEG, WebM, 
ASF, VOB, and Ogg Theora.

	What are the best formats for Web videos? Browsers support 
several video formats, but there is not an official video standard for the Web. 
Web site developers sometimes have to provide a video in multiple formats 
to make it accessible to a variety of browsers and hardware devices. At 
the time this book was published, MPEG containers with the H.264 codec 
appeared to be the best candidates for widespread Web use. 
	Can I change videos from one format to another? Digital vid-
eos can be converted from one file format to another through a process 
called transcoding. If you want to move a video into a different file format, 
you can check to see if your video editing software offers a conversion, 
export, or transcoding option. If not, you can find transcoding software on 
the Web. Transcoding can cause loss of quality, so avoid transcoding an 
already transcoded video file.
	What tools are provided by video editing software? Basic 
video editing tools are used to arrange video clips, add a soundtrack, insert 
captions, select special effects such as fades between clips, and choose an 
output format (Figure 1-52).

 Unit 1
Issue: What is Fair Use?
Fair use is the right to use portions of copy-
righted material without the permission of the 
copyright holder for purposes such as review, criti-
cism, or parody. Under certain circumstances, Fair 
Use is also a successful defense for practices, such 
as time shifting, in which whole works are recorded 
for later use. 
Exactly what constitutes Fair Use, however, is only 
sketched out in copyright law. The precise nature of 
Fair Use is shaped by court decisions covering situ-
ations and devices as diverse as vinyl 
records, printer toner cartridges, vid-
eotape recorders, and file sharing 
networks.
It seems incredible, but there once 
were no restrictions on copying sound 
recordings. “Record pirates” could 
legally copy and distribute, say, an 
Elvis Presley recording. 
In 1971, the U.S. Congress passed 
the Sound Recording Act that pro-
hibited copying music for commercial 
use. The law was not, however, aimed 
at prohibiting consumers from making 
copies for their own use. 
The legal precedent that gave con-
sumers a green light for time shifting 
was the landmark 1984 Betamax case 
in which Universal Studios attempted to hold Sony 
Corp. of America liable for copyright infringement 
by people who used video recorders to tape movies 
from their televisions. The U.S. Supreme Court sided 
with Sony and concluded that some instances of time 
shifting were legal.
The court’s decision, however, was based on a defi-
nition of time shifting as “the practice of recording 
a program to view it once at a later time.” Note the 
word “once.” The Betamax case did not offer legal 
precedent for copying and saving content for viewing 
multiple times. 
The proliferation of computer networks and streaming 
media has made place shifting a reality. You can, for 
example, view a cable television broadcast sent from 
your Wi-Fi equipped set-top box in your living room 
to your Wi-Fi equipped laptop out on the deck. Your 
network, however, is transmitting a copy of the broad-
cast, a use of copyrighted work that is not explicitly 
allowed by copyright law in most countries. Therefore, 
unless a user agreement extends the basic rights 
granted by copyright law, place shifting would be con-
sidered a questionable practice. 
So how about format shifting? Surely, it must be legal 
to rip tracks from a CD that you own, save them as 
an MP3 file, and play them on your iPod. Many con-
sumers believe that they have a right to use a legally 
purchased song or video in any man-
ner they please short of redistributing 
it for profit. 
Consumers are familiar with copyright 
restrictions on printed books and have 
an expectation that digital media can 
be legally used in parallel ways.
Readers expect to be able to carry a 
book with them to any location, read 
it at any time, use any type of reading 
light or reading glasses, loan the book 
to friends, and sell the book when they 
have finished using it. 
No wonder consumers are peeved 
when ebook vendors and other digi-
tal content providers use various 
technologies to limit how much of an 
ebook can be viewed, whether the 
text can be printed or shared, and how long it can 
be viewed.
Although it is convenient to focus on the “once I buy it, 
I can use it as I like” rationale, we tend to ignore situ-
ations in which our expectations about content use 
are more limited. For example, we do not expect that 
after attending a Widespread Panic concert, we are 
entitled to a free MP3 of the performance. If we pay 
to see a movie at a theater, we don’t then expect to 
download the movie or soundtrack for free when they 
are released. 
From rock concerts to theaters, consumers are famil-
iar with the idea that different venues and formats 
might require separate payments. Digital rights man-
agement technologies simply enforce this idea in 
practice.

1. What would you change about the Fair Use policy to make it more 
fair?
2. In your opinion, do sites like the iTunes Store provide consumers with 
enough flexibility for copying files and creating playlists?
3. Have you heard of situations in which someone appeared to follow 
Fair Use guidelines, but was still charged with copyright infringement? 
What Do You Think?
 ISSUE
TRY IT! Do you know how to legally use music, movies, ebooks, 
and other media? Here’s a chance for you to explore Fair Use and content 
usage policies.
	 Fair Use is defined in Section 107 of U.S. copyright law. It includes four 
factors designed to determine whether a use is fair. Look up Section 
107 of the U.S. Copyright Law. In your own words, what are those four 
factors?
	 The book Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip included 
concert posters and ticket images used without 
approval of the copyright holder. In a subsequent 
suit, courts decided the use was fair and transfor-
mative, based on a four-factor analysis. Look up 
the results of this case by searching for the article, 
Grateful Dead Posters’ Re-publication Held to Be a 
Transformative, Fair Use by Martine Courant Rife. In 
your own words, what did the court say about each of 
the four factors?
	 “Transformative use” means that you change a 
work enough to make it your own. Collages, music 
remixes, and video parodies can fall into this cat-
egory. Find an example of a transformative work on 
YouTube and list the original works from which it is 
derived. In your opinion, what makes this a transfor-
mative work?
	 Digital content providers such as iTunes, Amazon, 
and Google each have their own rules about how you 
can use the content you purchase, rent, or subscribe 
to. To get an idea of a typical usage policy, search for Amazon Instant 
Video Usage Rules, and then answer the following questions: 
	
a. Are you allowed to stream more than one video at a time?
	
b. Are you allowed to stream the same video to two devices at the 
same time?
	
c. Are you allowed to stream videos to any digital device?
	
d. Are you allowed to save rented content to a handheld device so that 
you can watch it after the viewing period has ended?
	 Because digital music is so accessible, it can be easily added to video 
footage as a soundtrack. Suppose you’ve purchased a Beyonce song 
on iTunes. You want to use the song as a soundtrack for a video that 
you plan to post on YouTube. Would using the song in that situation be 
considered Fair Use? Would it be transformative? Check the YouTube 
Web page “What is Copyright?” to find out.

Issue: What Is the Value of Information?
Information Tools: Photo Forensics
Mircea BEZERGHEANU/Shutterstock.com
Digital tools make it easy to manipulate images. Many 
of the photos we see in magazines, in newspapers, 
and online have been adjusted to improve color and 
contrast. But they can also be altered in ways that are 
intended to deceive viewers.
Some images are obviously fake. Just about every-
one is familiar with tabloid cover photos with a 
celebrity’s head pasted onto another person’s body, 
and cosmetic ads airbrushed beyond believability. 
According to researchers, most people can identify 
clumsy photo fakes by looking for body parts that 
seem out of proportion and cloned areas that repeat 
themselves within the image. 
Savvy consumers understand that the faces and bod-
ies depicted in ads are not always realistic, but they 
have different expectations about photojournalism 
and the photos published about world events.
Photos in mainstream news outlets affect our views 
and opinions of real events. Yet photographs that 
record these events are sometimes manipulated to 
improve composition or convey a message. 
Although detailed photographic analysis is out of the 
hands of readers, most photo fakes are eventually 
unmasked. Before you base opinions on a dramatic 
photo or use an image to substantiate your own 
research, check Internet resources to make sure the 
photo is not a known fake.

The top photo, supplied by the Iranian state media, was 
published in The New York Times and other newspapers 
before it was discovered that the photo had been doc-
tored to conceal a malfunctioning missile (shown in the 
bottom unaltered photo). In the doctored photo, the 
third missile from the left was digitally added by cloning 
parts of the other missiles. Can you identify the cloned 
sections?
	 To spot a fake photo, look for:
◗◗Body parts that seem out of proportion
◗◗Remnants of body parts, scenery, or objects 
removed from a photo
◗◗Areas of lighting that seem brighter or darker 
than they should be
◗◗Light and shadow that are not consistent for all 
objects in the photo
◗◗Parts of the background or crowd that seem to 
be cloned duplicates

TRY IT! “If you can change photographs, you can change history.” 
That quote from Hany Farid, a computer scientist specializing in digital 
forensics, contains a warning about the perils of digital photo manipulation. 
Here’s your chance to find out how to uncover photo forgeries.
	 The Web site www.fourandsix.com has a “Photo Tampering throughout 
History” link with some surprising information about doctored photos, 
beginning with an iconic image of Abraham Lincoln. Look through the 
photo gallery and select the five photos you think are the most mis-
leading, then explain why.
	 It is surprisingly easy to edit digital photos using today’s sophisticated 
graphics software. To see how it works, check out the YouTube video 
“Adobe Photoshop CS5: Content-Aware Fill Sneak Peek.” List five 
items that were manipulated in the photo. 
	 A Web site called TinEye bills itself as a reverse image search engine. 
Given any image, TinEye can find out where it came from and how 
it is being used. TinEye even finds modified versions of the image. 
Click the Goodies link and follow the Cool Searches link for some eye-
opening examples of image modification. Then, upload an image of 
your own (or use an image that you select from the Web) to see what 
TinEye finds. Take a screenshot of your results. (Use the PrtSc or Print 
Screen key on a PC; use Command-Shift-3 on a Mac.)
	 Exif (Exchangeable image file format) data can reveal information 
that helps to verify or unveil a photo’s origins. Specialized software is 
needed to view all the Exif data, but operating system utilities display 
some of the data. Select a photo stored in JPEG format and view its 
tags. On a PC, right-click the image, select Properties, then select the 
Details tab. On a Mac, click File, click Get Info, then expand the More 
Info section. Which of the following are revealed?
	
a. Date taken	
	
	
c. Camera brand and model
	
b. Date modified	
	
	
d. Photographer
	
	
	
	
	
	
e. Place taken
	 A technique called error level analysis measures compression levels 
in JPEG images. In theory, images that have not been doctored will 
have consistent levels of compression across the entire image. 
Doctored images, however, may have areas that show different levels 
of compression. 
	
To see for yourself, connect to fotoforensics.com and look at the exam-
ples in the ELA tutorials. Next, upload an example of your own. Collect 
a screenshot of the analysis. Use graphics software to change some-
thing on the original image. For example, you might superimpose a 
circle on it, or paste in a part from another photo. Upload it and collect 
a screen image. Did the analysis catch your modification? 
	 When the eye cannot discern whether a photo is real or fake, photo 
detectives turn to computer science, mathematics, and physics to find 
answers. The same equations that are used to create light and shad-
ows in 3-D rendered images can also be used to analyze the shadows 
in a suspicious photograph. Dartmouth College researcher Hany 
Farid conducted an analysis of a suspicious shadow in a frame of the 
1962 Zapruder film of President Kennedy’s assassination. Locate his 
research paper. What did he conclude? Was the film a fake or real?

Unit 1
In 1895, eager Parisians crowded into a busy 
cafe to watch the first public presentation of an 
exciting new invention—the Cinematograph. The 
10-minute film, mostly scenes of everyday life, was 
a smashing success and ushered in the motion pic-
ture era. Early films were short, grainy, grayscale, 
and silent, but technology quickly improved. In the 
New York debut of The Jazz Singer (1927), Al Jolson 
spoke the first words in a feature film, “Wait a minute, 
wait a minute. You ain’t heard nothin’ yet!” 
Even before “talkies” and Technicolor, filmmakers 
sought ways to escape the bounds of reality through 
special effects. As early as 1925, directors such as 
Willis O’Brien used stop-motion photography to ani-
mate dinosaurs, giant gorillas, and sword-wielding 
skeletons. Special-effects technologies—miniatures, 
blue screens, puppets, Claymation, 3-D, and com-
posite shots—were used with varying degrees of 
skill over the next 50 years. Films such as Stanley 
Kubrick’s masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey 
(1968), and George Lucas’s original Star Wars 
(1977) stretched these technologies to their limits, 
but audiences demanded even more spectacular, yet 
“realistic,” effects.
In 1982, Disney released TRON, a movie about a 
programmer who becomes trapped in the depths of 
a computer where programs are human-like crea-
tures that serve every whim of an evil Master Control 
Program. The movie included the first primitive 
attempts at computer-generated footage—30 minutes 
of computer-generated imagery (CGI) created by two 
Cray X-MP supercomputers. 
CGI uses rendering techniques to create a 3-D scene 
from a 2-D image, a camera angle, and a light source. 
Sophisticated algorithms determine how textures, 
colors, and shadows appear in the rendered scene. 
Camera angles can be changed at will, and fantastic 
effects can be created by bending or stretching the 
image, manipulating light, creating textures, and add-
ing movement to the scene. 
Rendered scenes can be set in motion with computer 
animation techniques. Manual animation requires a 
painstaking process called in-betweening, in which an 
artist draws a series of incrementally different images 
to produce the illusion of movement. Computers 
can easily generate in-between images and free up 
human animators for more challenging work.
A captivating animation special effect called morphing 
was first seen on the big screen in James Cameron’s 
The Abyss (1989), and was later used in Terminator 2 
(1991) and other movies. Like in-betweening, morph-
ing starts out with animators defining the morph’s start 
and end points—for example, in Terminator 2, the liq-
uid metal face of the T-1000 robot and actor Robert 
Patrick’s face. The start and end points are rendered 
into digital images, and then the computer generates 
all the in-between images. Human animators tweak 
the images by inserting small discrepancies for a 
touch of less-than-perfect realism in the final footage. 
Although the process might sound simple, morphing 
complex objects realistically and believably takes a 
tremendous amount of time and computer power. The 
five-minute morphing sequence in Terminator 2 took 
special-effects company Industrial Light & Magic a 
year to create.
Memorable computer-generated scenes from clas-
sic blockbusters include the breathtaking aerial 
scenes in Spiderman, a furry blue monster called 
Sully careening downhill in Monsters, Inc., the end-
less army of Uruk-hai marching down the valley 
toward Helm’s Deep in The Lord of the Rings: The 
Two Towers, and Princess Merida unfurling her wildly 
curly locks in Brave. 
Spiderman’s acrobatic swing through Manhattan was 
generated with three professional rendering products: 
Maya, Houdini, and RenderMan. The Uruk-hai were 
created with MASSIVE, a custom program that gave 
each computer-generated warrior a unique sequence 
of actions. To individually animate each of Sully’s 
2,320,413 blue hairs, animators developed software 
called Fizt, a dynamic simulator.
Animation took another leap forward when Pixar’s 
team of artists and engineers developed a computer 
program called Taz to realistically depict Princess 
Merida’s flowing, curly hair.

Rendering, morphing, and other special effects 
require sophisticated computer systems. Pixar 
Animation Studios, the company that provided 
the technology behind Toy Story, Up, Ratatouille, 
WALL‑E, and many other feature-length animated 
films, uses a cluster of computers called a render-
farm. 
The film Toy Story took more than 800,000 computer 
hours to produce using the renderfarm. That might 
seem like a long time; but if Pixar animators had used 
a single-processor computer, it would have taken 43 
years to finish the job!
Other CGI variations are being used for increas-
ingly sophisticated effects. Special-effects guru John 
Gaeta developed bullet time and image-based ren-
dering for The Matrix (1999). Bullet time produces 
reality-defying action sequences that slow time to a 
tantalizing crawl and then crank it back up to normal 
speed as the camera pivots rapidly around the scene. 
The effect requires a computer to meticulously trig-
ger a circular array of more than 100 still cameras. 
Films such as Sky Captain 
and the World of Tomorrow 
(2004) and Sin City (2005) 
took green screen special 
effects to a new level. Filmed 
entirely indoors on a sound 
stage, these movies used a 
technique called compositing 
that layers two or more video 
clips over each other and 
merges them into one image. 
Actors were filmed against 
a green background screen. 
During post-production, video 
editing software removed the 
background and layered in 
scenery created with CGI or 
from real footage on location. 
Sin City is also notable as 
one of the first fully digital live action motion pic-
tures. It was filmed in full color with high-definition 
digital cameras. The footage was converted to black 
and white, and then color was reintroduced digitally 
with the use of a DLP Cinema projector. 
Until 2013, movies were distributed on film, but 
Paramount Pictures led the switch to digital. Now 
studios deliver most films on hard drives or through 
an Internet download. For the dwindling number of 
theaters without digital projection equipment, digital 
footage can be output to film and reproduced using 
legacy techniques.
Motion capture suits were put to award-winning 
use for Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings. The 
actor who played Gollum was outfitted with sen-
sors that tracked the position of his head, arms, and 
limbs. The collected data was later used by anima-
tors to create the 3-D animated Gollum seen on 
the screen. Motion capture was further refined for 
Avatar, which used digital technology to capture the 
actors’ facial expressions.
Sophisticated animation and rendering techniques 
now come close to producing realistic human figures. 
Animations were once clearly two-dimensional and 
far from lifelike, but CGI renderings are becoming 
more difficult to distinguish from real actors. 
What might happen in the future is the subject of 
Simone (2002), starring Al Pacino as a washed-up 
director who is given a hard disk containing code for 
a computer-generated movie star. Pacino uses her 
as the leading lady in a string of hits, all the while 
keeping her identity secret. According to reviewer 
Leigh Johnson, it becomes clear that Simone, a com-
puter-generated image, is more 
authentic than the people watch-
ing her. It is one of the film’s main 
themes, expressed by Pacino’s 
character: “Our ability to manufac-
ture fraud now exceeds our ability 
to detect it.” 
The implications of computer-gen-
erated actors are just emerging. 
Not only do they blur the line 
between reality and fiction, but 
they also raise puzzling ques-
tions for actors and their agents, 
directors, and programmers. Is it 
possible to create CGI doubles for 
long-dead actors, such as Marilyn 
Monroe and James Dean? If so, 
who controls their use and profits 
from their work? Can aging actors 
sign contracts for use of their 
“young” CGI counterparts? Would it be legal and 
ethical for programmers to create and market virtual 
characters based on real actors or a compilation of 
the best traits of popular stars? As is often the case, 
new technologies present issues along with their 
benefits—issues you might want to consider the next 
time you watch a movie.

Critical Thinking
Copyright laws are changing as digital sound, 
image, and video technologies evolve and become 
easier to use. Although the courts seem to clearly 
hold that it is illegal to copy media for profit, they 
are not as clear about the acceptability of modifica-
tions. For example, video editing software makes it 
relatively simple for people to clip out parts of mov-
ies they find to be objectionable to themselves or 
their children. Should it be legal to do so for per-
sonal use? What if an organization wanted to rent 
out such edited copies? What if a specialized video 
player was set up so that it would edit and display 
the revised version on the fly? After you consider 
your own opinion, you might check the Web to see 
the latest information about this issue.
Group Project
Work with a group of four students to research 
three Web-based music download sites. Create 
one PowerPoint slide for each site. The slide 
should give a basic overview of the site, including 
its name, URL, music file format, price, pros, and 
cons. For the final slide in the presentation, create 
a table comparing the features and prices of each 
site. 
Cyberclassroom
Each person on your team should email a photo in 
JPEG format to the other members of the group. 
The photo can be one you’ve taken or one you find 
on the Web. If you get your photo from the Web, 
make sure there are no restrictions on using it for 
a personal project, and note the Web site’s URL 
so you have a record of your source. When you 
receive the photos from your teammates, be cre-
ative and use Photoshop or similar photo editing 
software to create a composite image that contains 
elements from all the photos. Submit your original 
photo and your composite photo to your instructor.
Multimedia Project
Use Windows Sound Recorder or similar software 
to record an original 15-second radio ad for your 
favorite music or video download service. Be sure 
to use an efficient sampling rate. Submit the text of 
your script along with the MP3 file containing your 
ad.
Resume Builder
Artists routinely create a portfolio containing 
examples of their best work. How can you apply 
the portfolio concept to your job search? Suppose 
you’ve decided to create a multimedia portfolio that 
showcases your talents. Describe what you’d like 
your portfolio to contain, indicating which of the 
items you currently have and which you’d like to 
create and add in the future. Also, describe the for-
mat for each item: photo, document, scan, audio, 
or video.
Globalization
The United States has been accused of exporting 
its culture and values through films and television. 
Sometimes referred to as “Coca-Colonization,” the 
mass exportation of American culture is expected 
to increase as more and more people have access 
to the Internet. But is digital distribution a two-way 
street? What can you find out about the importation 
of cultures to the United States (or your country)? 
Incorporate your findings into a two-page paper. 
Make sure you cite specific examples and offer 
your ideas on how technology aids or discourages 
cross-cultural interchanges. Include a list of refer-
ences on a third page.

Interactive Summary

Unit 1
SECTION B: Music, voice, and sound effects can all be 
recorded and stored on a computer as 
 
audio. To digitally record sound, 
 
of the sound are collected at periodic intervals and stored as 
numeric data. High-quality sound is usually sampled at 44.1 
 , and each stereo sample requires 32 bits 
of storage space. To conserve space, radio-quality record-
ings of speaking voices are often recorded at lower sampling 
rates. Digital audio file formats include WAV, AAC, WMA, 
Ogg, and MP3. Most portable media players work with MP3 
format or with the 
 format, used for .m4p 
files at the iTunes Store. These media files can be acquired 
as a download, 
 stream, or on-demand 
stream. MIDI music is 
 sound that is 
artificially created. A series of MIDI 
 
specify the pitch, volume, and duration of notes that sound 
like various musical instruments. MIDI files are typically 
much smaller than digital audio files for similar musical pas-
sages. However, MIDI music tends to lack the full resonance 
of symphony-quality sound that can be achieved with digital 
audio. Speech 
 is the process by which 
machines, such as computers, produce sound that resembles 
spoken words. Speech 
 refers to the abil-
ity of machines to “understand” spoken words.
SECTION A: 
 data is pro-
cessed, stored, and transmitted as a series of 1s and 0s. Each 
1 or 0 is called a(n) 
 . A series of 
eight 0s and 1s, called a(n) 
  , 
represents one character—a letter, number, or punctua-
tion mark. Data becomes 
 when 
it is presented in a format that people can understand 
and use. Digital signals are represented by two different 
 , such as +5 volts and +.2 volts. 
Digital data can also take the form of light and dark spots 
etched onto the surface of a CD or the positive and negative 
orientation of 
 particles on the sur-
face of a hard disk. 
 data consists 
of numbers that might be used in arithmetic operations. It can 
be represented digitally using the 
 
number system. 
 data is com-
posed of letters, symbols, and numerals that are not 
used in arithmetic operations. Computers represent this 
type of data using 
 , EBCDIC, 
Unicode, or UTF-8. Data is quantified using terms such as 
 or kibibyte (1024 bytes), and pre-
fixes such as 
 or mebi (1,048,576), 
and giga or 
 (1,073,741,824). To 
reduce file size and transmission times, digital data can be 
compressed. 
 compression pro-
vides the means to compress data and reconstitute it into its 
original state. 
 compression throws 
away some of the original data during the compression process. 
Compressed files usually have 
 
at the end of the file name and are represented with special 
icons. These files have to be 
 or 
unzipped before you can view the data they contain.

Section C: A bitmap graphic is composed of a grid of 
tiny rectangular cells called 
 . The color 
of each cell is stored as a(n) 
 number. 
Popular bitmap graphics formats include BMP, TIFF, GIF, 
JPEG, RAW, and PNG. Of these formats, GIF, JPEG, and 
PNG are supported by most Web browsers. Both scanners 
and cameras produce images in bitmap format. Digital dis-
play devices represent colors using the 
 
color model. Although colors are ultimately represented as 
bits when a graphic is stored or transmitted, color values 
can be specified in binary, 
 , or deci-
mal. Color 
 refers to the num-
ber of colors available for use in an image. The dimensions 
of the grid that forms a bitmap graphic are referred to as its 
 . High-resolution graphics typically 
produce better image quality than low-resolution graph-
ics, but require more storage space. It is possible to change 
the resolution and/or the file size of a bitmap graphic; but 
because bitmaps are resolution 
 , these 
changes can reduce image quality. For example, enlarg-
ing a bitmap requires your computer to fill in missing pix-
els, which often results in a jagged or 
 
image. Image compression shrinks the size of a graphics file. 
 compression is used for images stored 
in JPEG format, but 
 compression 
is used for PNG, GIF, and TIFF files. Photoediting software 
includes tools, such as an image 
 , 
that adjusts brightness values for various ranges of pix-
els. Algorithms for 
 scrub out 
designated areas of an image and replace the missing pix-
els. Clipping paths and alpha blending are useful for digital 
 when you want to assemble parts of 
several photos into one image.  
SECTION D: Unlike a bitmap graphic, created by 
superimposing a grid of pixels over an image, a vector graphic 
consists of a set of instructions for creating a picture. Vector 
graphics are stored as a collection of 
 
and their corresponding sizes, colors, and positions. The big 
advantage of vector graphics is that they can be enlarged 
without becoming 
 . Vector graphics are 
created by using 
 software. A vector 
graphic can be converted into a bitmap by a process called 
 . Once converted, however, the result-
ing graphic loses the object-editing qualities it had in its vector 
state. The most common vector graphics format for the Web 
is 
 . 3-D graphics are stored as a set of 
instructions that contain the locations and lengths of lines that 
form a(n) 
 for a 3-D object. This 
framework then can be covered by colored, patterned, and tex-
tured surfaces. This process, called 
 , 
produces a bitmap image of the 3-D object. 
 
tracing adds highlights and shadows to the image. 3-D graph-
ics can be animated to produce special effects for movies and 
animated characters for 3-D computer games. 
SECTION E: Footage for digital videos can be sup-
plied from a digital source, or from a(n) 
 
source that requires conversion. In addition to standalone digi-
tal cameras, digital footage can also be obtained from cameras 
embedded in handheld devices and from 
 
built in above a computer screen. Video resolution varies, but 
1080p is common. The “p” stands for 
 
scan. Most videos today have a widescreen aspect ratio of 
 . Most videos are output in a com-
pressed format using intraframe and 
 
compression. Software, such as MPEG, DivX, Theora, and 
H.264, that compresses the video stream is referred to as a(n) 
 . A compression 
 
indicates the degree of compression. A video file compressed 
at 35:1 has more compression, a smaller file size, and lower 
image quality than a file compressed at 5:1. Video and audio 
streams are combined into the final video file and stored using 
a(n) 
 format, such as AVI, MOV, or WebM.

LAB: The Digital World with Eyes Shut
1
THE DIGITAL WORLD IS VERY VISUAL. Email demands to be read. Web sites are full of text. Social media feeds 
are constantly changing. Pinterest and Flickr are all about photos. And a lifetime is not long enough to view all the vid-
eos on YouTube. But what would this digital world be like if you could not see it? Can speech synthesizers and voice 
recognition tools change the visual experience into an auditory one? In this lab, you’ll have an opportunity to set up a 
screen reader, activate voice recognition, and experience the digital world with your eyes closed.
REQUIREMENTS: 
For this lab, you’ll need a Windows computer, an Apple computer, an iPhone 4s or newer, or an Android phone. The 
instructions are generalized; they provide helpful guidelines, but not specific steps. You may have to explore a bit to find 
all the tools needed to complete the assignment, but that is all part of the learning experience. You might find this lab 
goes more smoothly if you work with a partner.
ASSIGNMENT:
 Activate voice commands on your device. 
On a Mac, select the Apple menu, then choose System 
Preferences, Accessibility, and Speakable items. Turn on 
Speakable items. 
On a PC with Windows, locate the Speech Recognition 
utility. Select a microphone, then continue with the setup 
(choosing Disable document review). You can access a 
tutorial here: windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/
using-speech-recognition. 
On an iPhone, access Settings, select General, then 
select Siri. Make sure Siri is on. Hold the Home button to 
open Siri (or hold it up to your ear if you’ve enabled Raise 
to Speak).
On an Android phone, access the Settings menu, select 
My device, then choose Voice control. Turn voice control 
on, then select it to find out what kinds of commands you 
can say. 
 Try these activities and make notes on the results:
Does your device respond when you ask “What time is 
it?”
Can you launch the camera app and take a photo using 
voice commands?
Can you issue a voice command to get to the desktop, 
Start screen, or Home screen?
Can you dictate an email message or text message using 
only voice commands?
 Activate the screen reader for your device.
On a Mac, select the Apple icon, then choose System 
Preferences, Accessibility, and VoiceOver. Enable 
VoiceOver. (Leave the Accessibility window open so that 
you can disable VoiceOver when you complete the lab.)  
Take a few minutes to step through the VoiceOver train-
ing.
On a PC with Windows, go to the Start screen and search 
for Narrator (or start Control Panel and select Ease of 
Access). Select the Start Narrator button.
On an iPhone, make sure Siri is still activated.
On an Android phone, select Applications, Accessibility, 
and TalkBack. Turn TalkBack on. Listen carefully to the 
instructions; you have to tap twice to select any screen 
options.
 Close your eyes and try a very simple activity, such 
as starting a browser, going to Wikipedia, and searching 
for information about wolves. Describe your experience.
 With your eyes open, explore the Web to locate any 
additional information or settings that might make naviga-
tion with eyes shut easier. Describe what you find.
 Reset your device to its usual speech mode.

COMPUTERs
Pixar’s huge server array that renders 3-D animated movies and the tiny 
iPhone you can hold in your hand have more in common than you might 
think. These devices, along with mainframes, desktops, tablets, ebook 
readers, and game consoles, are all based on computer technology. 
Understanding the classical definition of a computer provides a useful pic-
ture of what all these devices have in common.
	 What is a computer? Most people can formulate a mental picture 
of a computer, but computers do so many things and come in such a vari-
ety of shapes and sizes that it might seem difficult to distill their common 
characteristics into an all-purpose definition. At its core, a computer is a 
multipurpose device that accepts input, processes data, stores data, and 
produces output, all according to a series of stored instructions. 
Input is whatever is typed, submitted, or transmitted to a computer. Output 
is the result produced by a computer. Input and output can be handled 
by components contained within the computer or by peripheral devices, 
such as keyboards and printers, that are attached to the computer with 
cables or connected wirelessly.
Computers process data by performing calculations, modifying docu-
ments and pictures, drawing graphs, and sorting lists of words or numbers. 
Processing is handled by the computer’s central processing unit (CPU). 
The CPU of most modern computers is a microprocessor, which is an 
electronic component that can be programmed to process data.
Computers store data and the software that processes data. Most 
computers have temporary holding areas called memory in addition to 
long-term storage housed on hard disks or flash drives. Figure 2-1 illus-
trates the IPOS (input, process, output, store) activities characteristic of 
computers.
Terminology
The word computer has been 
part of the English language 
since 1613; but if you look in 
a dictionary printed before 
1940, you might be surprised 
to find a computer defined 
as a person who performs 
calculations. Prior to 1940, 
machines designed to perform 
calculations were usually 
referred to as calculators and 
­tabulators, not ­computers. 
The modern definition and 
use of the term computer 
emerged in the 1940s, when 
the first electronic computing 
devices were developed.

	 What’s so significant about a computer’s ability to store 
instructions? The instructions that tell a digital device how to carry out 
processing tasks are referred to as a computer ­program, or simply a 
program. These programs form the software that sets up a computer to 
do a specific task. When a computer “runs” software, it performs the instruc-
tions to carry out the task.
The first computers were “programmed” to perform a specific task by con-
necting wire circuitry in a certain way. Changing tasks meant rewiring the 
circuits. The term stored program means that a series of instructions for 
a computing task can be loaded into a ­computer’s memory. These instruc-
tions can be replaced easily by a ­different set of instructions when it is time 
for the computer to perform another task. This ability to switch programs 
makes computers multipurpose devices (Figure 2-2).
	 What kinds of software do comput-
ers run? Computers run three main types of 
software: application software, system soft-
ware, and development tools (Figure 2-3). A 
computer can be applied to many tasks, such 
as writing, number crunching, video editing, 
and online ­shopping. Application software is 
a set of computer programs that helps a per-
son carry out a task. 
Whereas application software is designed to 
help a person carry out a task, the primary 
purpose of system software is to help the 
computer system monitor itself in order to 
function efficiently. An example of system soft-
ware is a computer operating system (OS), 
which is essentially the master controller for all 
the activities that take place within a ­computer. 
Development tools are used for cre-
ating software applications, Web sites, 
operating systems, and utilities. Examples of 
development tools include computer program-
ming languages, such as C++, and scripting 
languages, such as HTML.
The stored program concept 
allows you to use a computer for 
one task, such as word process-
ing, and then easily switch to a 
different type of ­computing task, 
such as editing a photo or play-
ing music. It is the single most 
important ­characteristic that dis-
tinguishes computers from other 
simpler and less versatile digital 
devices, such as digital clocks, 
calculators, and cameras.

Circuits and Chips
The first computers were closet-sized devices filled with wires, vacuum 
tubes, transistors, and other bulky components. As digital electronics 
evolved, components became smaller and smaller. Open up a digital device. 
You won’t see clumps of wires and gears. Instead, you’ll see small circuit 
boards and integrated circuits. These tiny components are the essence of 
digital electronics.
	 What are digital electronics? Digital electronics represent data 
bits as electrical signals that travel over circuits in much the same way that 
electricity flows over a wire when you turn on a light switch. To represent 
data, such as 01101100, high-voltage signals are used for 1 bits, and low-
voltage signals are used for 0 bits. All the calculations performed by digital 
devices take place in a maze of electronic circuitry (Figure 2-4). 
	 What’s an integrated circuit? An integrated circuit (IC) is a set 
of microscopic electronic circuits etched onto a thin slice of semiconduct-
ing material. The terms computer chip, microchip, and chip are commonly 
used to refer to integrated circuits. Some integrated circuits are devoted to 
collecting input, while others might be devoted to processing tasks, output, 
or storage. The first computer chips contained fewer than 100 miniaturized 
components, such as resistors and transistors. The chips for today’s digital 
devices contain billions of transistors.
Semiconductors, such as silicon and germanium, are substances with 
properties between those of a conductor (like copper) and an insulator 
(like wood). To fabricate a chip, the conductive properties of selective 
parts of the semiconductor can be enhanced to essentially create min-
iature electronic ­pathways and components, such as transistors, as 
shown in Figure 2-5.
Chip ready for 
packaging
This little circuit is 
composed of electrical 
pathways (lines), tran-
sistors (circles), and 
resistors (rectangles). 
The electronics for 
digital devices require 
millions of similar cir-
cuits. Constructing 
these circuits from 
wires would produce 
gigantic devices.
QuickCheck
There is an abundant supply 
of materials for fabricating 
semiconductors because:

digital devices are mounted on a circuit board called a system board, moth-
erboard, or main board. The system board houses all essential chips and 
provides connecting circuitry between them. Figure 2-7 illustrates circuit 
boards for two digital devices. Although one device is a full-size computer 
and the other is an iPhone, they both have chips for processing, memory, 
input, and output.

The chips on a circuit board 
have identifying numbers that 
you can look up online. Suppose 
you’ve opened an iPad case and 
you’re looking at a chip labeled 
Broadcom BCM5974. Can you

Components
When you acquire a new digital device, your first step is to locate the power 
button and all the other hardware components. The devices we use today 
have a fairly predictable collection of features, depending on the device’s 
form factor. 
	 What is a form factor? In the computer industry, the term form 
factor refers to the size and dimensions of a device or components, such 
as circuit boards and system units. The term system unit is tech speak for 
the part of a digital device that holds the system board. It can apply to the 
body of a smartphone or laptop, as well as to the tower unit of a desktop 
computer. Digital devices are available in all sorts of form factors; some of 
the most popular include component, clamshell, and slate. 
	 What are the features of a component system? A com-
ponent device is composed of various standalone parts, such as a 
display unit, system unit, and keyboard. Components can be connected 
using cables or wireless signals. Most of the first personal computers 
were component systems. Today, this form factor is much less popular 
because of the effort required to assemble the components. Figure 2-8 
illustrates the hardware features of a typical component system.

devices have a keyboard as the base and a screen on the hinged cover. 
The system unit on these devices contains all of the basic components 
required for input, processing, storage, and output (Figure 2-9).
	 What are the features of a slate device? Devices config-
ured in the slate form factor feature a touchscreen that covers most of 
the device’s surface. The screen can display a virtual keyboard for text 
and numeric input. An additional control, such as a Home button or a 
circular control pad, is featured on some Apple devices. The system unit 
also includes controls for commonly used features, such as volume and 
airplane mode (Figure 2-10).

Maintenance
Digital devices can be costly. You can extend their life with a bit of regu-
lar maintenance. There are four components of digital devices that require 
maintenance: the system unit, keyboard, screen, and battery.
	 How do I start? Before you undertake any maintenance, turn the 
device off—that’s off, not just asleep—and disconnect any power cables. 
Doing so will prevent random screen swipes or key presses from altering 
your device settings. 
	 Which cleaning products are safe to use? The products 
you can use depend on the component you are cleaning. What might work 
well to scrub out stubborn stains on the system unit case could permanently 
cloud or scratch your touchscreen. Always follow the manufacturer’s advice 
for cleaning procedures and products (Figure 2-11).
Dust with a clean 
microfiber cloth and 
disinfect with anti-
bacterial wipes.
Use a low vacuum 
setting to remove 
dust from fan vents.
Only plug into a surge-
protected outlet.
	 How can I safely clean and disinfect a touchscreen? 
Touchscreens collect fingerprints and are a breeding ground for bacte-
ria, so it is a good idea to clean them periodically. Many touchscreens 
are made from Gorilla Glass, which is designed to resist scratching and 
cracking. Damaged screens can be replaced, but that can cost close to 
$100, so a few preventive measures may help you avoid costly repairs.
A plastic screen protector is the first line of defense against scratches 
and cracks. These films can be cleaned using water and a soft cloth, or a 
disinfecting wipe. When the screen protector gets grubby, simply peel it 
off and replace it with a new one.
Use a protective case 
or carrying bag.
Do not spray cleaning 
agents directly on the 
device; spray them 
onto a cleaning cloth.

recommendations.
Never immerse a device 
in liquid; water and 
electronics don’t mix.
Do not allow cleaning 
agents to drip on key-
boards or touchpads.
	 What kind of maintenance does the system unit 
require? Basic system unit maintenance is simple. You want to keep 
the unit clean, prevent it from overheating, shield it from damage, and 
protect it from electrical surges (Figure 2-12).

SECTION A, Unit 2
Without a screen protector, you will have to carefully clean the screen 
itself. Many touchscreens have an oleophobic coating designed to repel 
the oils deposited by fingertips. When alcohol is used to clean these 
screens, each application degrades the coating. Non-alcohol wipes are 
available, or use eyeglass cleaner. 
	 What about my keyboard? Keyboards quickly build up grime, 
gather dust, and collect crumbs. To start the cleaning process, turn the 
keyboard upside down and shake it gently to dislodge debris. Most manu-
facturers suggest using an antibacterial wipe to clean key surfaces. Take 
a moment to test the cleaning product on a small unnoticeable spot just 
to make sure it will not discolor the keys or leave a residue. Use cotton 
swabs to clean between the keys.
	 What is the best way to clean up spills? Liquids and elec-
tronics don’t mix. If you spill liquid on a device, turn it off immediately. 
With luck, that step will prevent electrical shorts that would permanently 
damage circuit boards. Once the device is off, you can assess the dam-
age. If the spill is water, dry off the device, shake out the moisture, and 
set it in a warm, dry place where there is good air circulation. A fan or hair 
dryer set on low can help drive out moisture. Allow the device to dry for at 
least 72 hours.
Sticky spills are another matter. If the goo has penetrated the interior of 
the device, it is best to leave the cleanup to a professional. If you think 
the spill only affected the surface, you can wipe the device with clean 
water and allow it to dry for 24 hours (Figure 2-13).
	 How do I maintain the battery for a device? You know 
how it goes. It happens to everyone. The battery on your device dies 
just when you really need it. Battery life is the time your device operates 
before it must be recharged. Battery lifespan is the amount of time a bat-
tery lasts until it must be replaced. Good maintenance extends the life of 
your battery and its lifetime so your digital devices are ready when you 
need them.
Most of today’s battery-powered digital devices contain a lithium ion 
(Li-ion) battery. Unlike batteries of the past, Li-ion batteries contain no 
toxic compounds and operate efficiently, but they are sensitive to heat.

Li-ion batteries can occasionally overheat and in the worst case, they can 
explode. Most devices today contain circuitry to prevent heat-triggered 
damage, but smart consumers don’t operate devices that are hot to the 
touch. 
Batteries have a discharge rate at which they lose charge even when 
not in use. The discharge rate for Li-ion batteries is quite low—about 
1.5% per month—so the batteries in your devices basically discharge 
only as they are used.
Device manufacturers often advertise battery watts per hour (Wh). A 60 
Wh battery will last 60 hours if it expends 1 watt per hour. A typical laptop 
uses about 30 watts per hour, however, so a 60 Wh battery can power the 
device for two hours (60 Wh ÷ 30 watts = 2 hours). 
Some applications require more battery power than others. Location-
based apps that keep track of your whereabouts are constantly using 
extra power to check cell towers or Wi-Fi networks. Push applications, 
such as autoretrieving email, make your device continually check for new 
messages. To extend battery life, disable these kinds of apps when you 
are not using them. Figure 2-14 summarizes good practices for charging 
and using Li-ion batteries.

Enterprise Computers
At one time, it was possible to define three distinct categories of 
­computers. Mainframes were housed in large, closet-sized metal frames. 
Minicomputers were smaller, less expensive, and less powerful, but they 
could support multiple users and run business software. Microcomputers 
were clearly differentiated from ­computers in other categories because they 
were dedicated to a single user and their CPUs consisted of a single micro-
processor chip. 
Today, microprocessors are no longer a distinction between computer 
categories because just about every computer uses one or more micropro-
cessors as its CPU. The term minicomputer has fallen into disuse, and the 
terms microcomputer and mainframe are used with less and less frequency.
	 What are the most powerful computers? The most powerful 
computers are generally used in businesses and government agencies. 
They have the ability to service many simultaneous users and process 
data at very fast speeds (Figure 2-15).
Supercomputers. A computer falls into the supercomputer category if 
it is, at the time of construction, one of the fastest computers in the world. 
Because of their speed, supercomputers can tackle complex tasks that just 
would not be practical for other computers. Typical uses for supercomput-
ers include breaking codes, modeling worldwide weather systems, and 
­simulating nuclear explosions. 
Computer manufacturers such as IBM, Cray, and China’s National 
University of Defense Technology have in recent years held top honors for 
the world’s fastest computer. Supercomputer speeds are measured in pet-
aflops (PFLOPS). One petaflop is an astounding 1,000,000,000,000,000 
(quadrillion) mathematical calculations per second. That’s about 20,000 
times faster than your laptop computer.
Mainframes. A mainframe computer (or simply a mainframe) is a large 
and expensive computer capable of simultaneously processing data for 
hundreds or thousands of users. Its main processing circuitry is housed in 
a closet-sized cabinet like the one shown at left; but after large components 
are added for storage and output, a mainframe installation can fill a good-
sized room. 
Mainframes are generally used by businesses and government agencies 
to provide centralized storage, processing, and management for large 
amounts of data. For example, banks depend on mainframes as their com-
puter of choice to ensure reliability, data security, and centralized ­control. 
The price of a mainframe computer ­typically starts at several hundred thou-
sand dollars and can easily exceed $1 million. 
Servers. The purpose of a server is to “serve” data to computers con-
nected to a network. When you search Google or access a Web site, the 
information you obtain is provided by servers. At ecommerce sites, the 
store’s merchandise information is housed in database servers. Email, 
chat, Skype, and online multiplayer games are all operated by servers. 
Technically, just about any computer can be configured to perform the 
work of a server. However, computer manufacturers such as IBM and Dell 
offer devices classified as servers that are especially suited for storing and 
distributing data on networks. These devices are about the size of a desk 
drawer and are often mounted in racks of multiple servers.

SECTION B, Unit 2
Personal Computers
A personal computer is designed to meet the comput-
ing needs of an individual. These computers were originally 
referred to as microcomputers. Personal computers provide 
access to a wide variety of computing applications, such as 
word processing, photo editing, email, and Internet access. 
The term personal computer is sometimes abbreviated as 
PC. However, PC can also refer to a specific type of ­personal 
computer that descended from the original IBM PC and runs 
Windows software. In this book, PC refers to IBM PC descen-
dants. It is not used as an ­abbreviation for ­personal computer. 
What are the options for personal computers? 
Personal computers can be classified as desktop, portable, or 
mobile devices. The lines that delineate these categories are 
sometimes a bit blurry, but the general characteristics of each 
category are described below and common configurations are 
shown in Figure 2-16. 
Desktops. A desktop computer fits on a desk and runs on 
power from an electrical wall outlet. The keyboard is typically 
a separate ­component connected to the main unit by a cable. 
A desktop computer can be housed in a vertical case or in a 
horizontal case. In some modern desktops, called all-in-one 
units, the system board is incorporated into the display device. 
Desktop computers are popular for offices and schools where 
portability is not important. Their operating systems include 
Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. The price of an entry-
level desktop computer starts at $500 or a bit less. 
Portables. A portable computer runs on battery power. Its 
screen, keyboard, camera, storage devices, and speakers are 
fully contained in a single case so that the device can be eas-
ily transported from one place to another. Portable computers 
include laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
Laptops. A laptop computer (also referred to as a note-
book computer) is a small, lightweight personal computer 
designed like a clamshell with a keyboard as the base and a 
screen on the hinged cover. Most laptops use the same oper-
ating systems as desktop computers, with the exception of 
Chromebooks, which use Google’s Chrome OS as their oper-
ating system.
A Chromebook is a special category of laptop, designed to 
be connected to the Internet for most routine computing activi-
ties. Chromebook owners use Web-based software and store 
all their data in the cloud rather than on a local hard disk. 
Chromebooks use a standard clamshell form factor, so they 
look very much like a laptop. Their sub-$300 price tags are 
attractive to consumers who primarily browse the Web and 
use Web-based apps.

Tablets. A tablet computer is a portable computing device featuring 
a touch-sensitive screen that can be used for input as well as for output. 
Tablet computers use specialized operating systems, such as iOS, Android, 
and Microsoft Windows RT. Some models support cell phone network data 
plans but require apps such as Google Voice or Skype for voice calls.
A slate tablet configuration is basically a screen in a narrow frame that 
lacks a physical keyboard (although one can be attached). The Apple iPad 
and Samsung Galaxy Tab are popular slate tablets. A 2-in-1 (or convertible 
tablet) can be operated using its touch-sensitive screen or with a physical 
keyboard that can be folded out of the way or removed. 
Smartphones. Smartphones are mobile devices that have features simi-
lar to tablet computers, but also provide telecommunications capabilities 
over cell phone networks. They can make voice calls, send text messages, 
and access the Internet. Unlike a basic mobile phone, smartphones are 
programmable, so they can download, store, and run software.
A smartphone features a small keyboard or touchscreen and is designed 
to fit into a pocket, run on batteries, and be used while you are holding it in 
your hands (Figure 2-17). 
Figure 2-17: Smartphones accept input from a touchscreen or microphone
Smartphones are equipped with built-in speech recognition that allows 
you to ask questions and control the device using spoken commands. 
Smartphones also include GPS capability so that apps can provide loca-
tion-based services such as a route navigation map or a list of nearby 
restaurants. 
Smartphones evolved from basic cell phones and PDAs. A PDA (personal 
digital assistant) was a handheld device used as an electronic appointment 
book, calculator, and notepad. Modern smartphones include a similar suite 
of applications, but they also have access to a huge variety of mobile apps 
that help you calculate tips, play your favorite music, and entertain you with 
games. 
The operating systems for smartphones are similar to those used for tab-
let computers. iOS is used on the iPad and iPhone. Microsoft Windows 
Phone 8 is used on smartphones that offer a similar user experience as 
Windows RT tablets. The Android operating system used on Samsung 
tablets is also used for Samsung Galaxy and Motorola Droid smartphones. 
Smartphones are the most commonly used digital device in the world.

Niche Devices
The list of digital devices is long. Many devices, such as fitness track-
ers, cameras, and handheld GPSs, are dedicated to specific tasks. 
Other devices perform a wider variety of tasks. 
 What about other digital devices? Niche devices all have 
one thing in common: They contain a microprocessor. Some of these 
devices, such as smartwatches, smartglasses, and fitness trackers, 
can be classified as wearable computers. Which of the devices in 
Figure 2-18 do you own?
Ebook readers. Popularized by the NOOK and the Kindle, ebook 
readers are designed for displaying the content of digital publica-
tions, such as books, magazines, and newspapers. Dedicated ebook 
readers are limited to displaying digital books, but the Kindle Fire and 
NOOK Tablet include a browser for accessing the Internet and are 
also classified as tablet computers.
Game consoles. Devices for playing computer games include 
Sony’s PlayStation, Nintendo’s Wii, and Microsoft’s Xbox. They fea-
ture powerful processing capability and excellent graphics, but they 
are generally used for dedicated game playing and streaming videos 
rather than running application software.
Portable media players. Media players, such as the iPod Touch, 
revolutionized the music industry by providing consumers with a 
handheld device that can store and play thousands of songs. These 
devices are controlled by touchscreens or simple click-wheel mecha-
nisms.
Smartwatches. Watches and clocks were some of the first devices 
to go digital. Mass produced in the 1970s with a price as low as 
$10, these watches were limited to time and date functions. In 2013, 
Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm introduced a new breed of digi-
tal watch. Dubbed smartwatches, these multifunction devices can 
include a camera, thermometer, compass, calculator, cell phone, 
GPS, media player, and fitness tracker. Some smartwatch functions 
are onboard the device, whereas other functions require access to the 
Internet or to the wearer’s smartphone. 
Smartglasses. Head-mounted digital devices designed to look like 
eyeglasses are called smartglasses. These devices, which include 
the well-known Google Glass, are controlled by voice commands or a 
touchpad on the rim. They include a camera and a display device that 
essentially beams an image toward the wearer’s eye. Apps for smart-
glasses provide access to email and popular social media sites, such 
as Facebook and Twitter.
Activity trackers. To monitor activity throughout the day, you can 
wear a fitness tracker. These devices, worn on the wrist or clipped to 
a pocket, monitor your steps and heart rate. They can calculate calo-
ries, graph your fitness achievements, and share information with your 
Facebook friends. 
Smart appliances. Modern refrigerators, washing machines, 
and other appliances are controlled by integrated circuits called 
microcontrollers that combine sensors with processing circuitry. 
Microcontrollers can monitor energy efficiency, offer programmed start 
times, and may be controlled remotely from a smartphone or laptop.

Choosing a Digital Device
The process of selecting a digital device is all about choices, and there can 
be an overwhelming number of them. Do you want a tablet or a laptop? Do 
you need a super-light device? What size screen? Mac or Windows? Is the 
most powerful and most expensive processor necessary? Understanding 
the choices is the key to getting the right device at the right price.
	 How do I get started? Whether you are replacing an outdated 
device or adding to your digital collection, the following activities can get 
you started:
Consider how you plan to use your device.
Choose the type of device. 
Decide on a budget and stick to it.
Select a platform.
Check out the device’s specifications.
	 Why is it important to figure out how I’m going to use my 
new device? Some digital tasks require specific devices, processing 
power, storage capacity, and connectivity. Therefore, if you consider the 
usage guidelines in Figure 2-19, you’re more likely to buy the right device 
and not have to purchase expensive upgrades later.

	 How important is compatibility? Suppose that you want to work 
on some assignments at home using the same software provided by your 
school lab. Maybe you want to transport data back and forth between your 
job and home. Or, perhaps your children want to use a computer at home 
that is similar to those they use at school. 
Computers that operate in essentially the same way and use the same soft-
ware are said to be compatible. They can also be described as having the 
same “platform.” To assess whether two computers are compatible, check 
their operating systems. Computers with the same operating systems can 
typically use the same software and peripheral devices. Figure 2-21 pro-
vides an overview of popular platforms. You’ll learn more about operating 
systems in a later unit.

Figure 2-21: Compatibility is related to operating systems 
	 Should I stick to one family of devices? As you can see from 
Figure 2-21, operating systems and the devices that use them are grouped 
into families. Apple produces OS X and iOS. Microsoft produces Windows, 
Windows RT, and Windows Phone. The open source community produces 
Linux for desktops and servers; and with the support of Google, it produces 
Chrome OS and Android.
The operating systems within a family have similarities in the way they look 
and function So if you are familiar with OS X on your laptop, then you might 
find it easier to work with an iPhone rather than an Android phone. 
Working within an operating system family can have other benefits. For 
example, if you are storing your photos, documents, and other data in 
Apple’s iCloud, you’ll have easier access to them from devices running iOS 
and OS X than from a device running Windows.
Finally, you might find that syncing and backing up data between devices is 
easier if they have operating systems from the same family.

SECTION B, Unit 2
	 What can I expect to pay for a personal device? The price tag 
for a smartphone is $200–$500, whereas tablet computer prices range from 
$200–$1,200. Desktop and laptop computers usually cost a bit more, with 
price points roughly grouped into three categories: above $1,200, $500–
$1,200, and under $500.
Computers priced above $1,200 contain one or more fast processors, a 
generous amount of RAM, and a copious amount of disk space. These 
computers contain state-of-the-art components and should not have to be 
replaced as quickly as less expensive computers. Computer game enthusi-
asts and anyone planning to work extensively with video editing, graphics, 
and desktop publishing are likely to require a high-end computer.
A majority of buyers select desktops and laptops that retail for between 
$500 and $1,200. These popular computers lack the flashy specifications 
of their state-of-the-art cousins but provide ample computing power to meet 
the needs of an average user. 
In the computer industry, the equivalent of a compact car is a sub-$500 
computer. The technology in these computers is usually a year or two old 
and you can expect reduced processor speed, memory capacity, and drive 
capacity. You might have to replace a budget computer sooner than a more 
expensive computer, but it should be serviceable for typical applications. 
	 What are the factors that have the biggest effect on device 
prices? A microprocessor is one of the most expensive components in a 
digital device. The newest, fastest microprocessor is likely to add several 
hundred dollars to the price tag.
Memory is another factor that affects price. For example, doubling the 
amount of memory in a smartphone could raise the cost from $199 to $299.
Large screens cost more to manufacture and raise the price of digital 
devices. An iMac—Apple’s version of an all-in-one desktop unit—with a 
27-inch screen costs $700 more than the 21-inch version. 
For laptops, size and weight make a difference in price. Thinner and lighter 
laptops are priced higher, not necessarily because they cost more to manu-
facture, but because they are more desirable to consumers.

microprocessors
A microprocessor is an integrated circuit designed to process instructions. 
It is the most important, and usually the most expensive, component of a 
digital device. The specifications for a microprocessor include the manufac-
turer’s name and the chip model. 
	 Which processors are popular for desktops and laptops? 
Intel Corporation is the world’s largest chipmaker and supplies a sizeable 
­percentage of the microprocessors that power desktops and laptops. In 
1971, Intel introduced the world’s first microprocessor—the 4004. Intel’s 
8088 processor powered the ­original IBM PC, and chips in Intel’s 8086 fam-
ily powered subsequent models of PCs manufactured by IBM and other 
companies.
The 8086 chip family set the standard for processors used in today’s desk-
top and laptop computers, as well as servers. This standard is sometimes 
referred to as x86 because it includes chip models that originally ended in 
86, such as the 8086, 80286, and 80386. 
Modern processors no longer follow Intel’s original numbering sequence, 
but x86 is still used when referring to the modern descendants of the 8086. 
Processors found in today’s desktops and laptops are x86 compatible, such 
as the Intel i3, i5, and i7 microprocessors (Figure 2-23), as well as Athlon 
and A-series processors manufactured by AMD. 
	 Which processors are popular for tablets and smartphones? 
Whereas processors based on x86 technology are inside just about all 
desktop and laptop computers, processors based on ARM technology 
dominate tablet computers and smartphones. ARM technology was origi-
nally designed by ARM Holdings, a British technology company founded by 
Acorn Computers, Apple Inc., and VLSI Technology. Today, ARM proces-
sors are designed and manufactured by companies that include NVIDIA, 
Samsung, and Nintendo. 
ARM-based processors are energy efficient—an important characteristic 
for devices that run primarily on battery power. ARM processors are found 
in Microsoft’s Surface tablets, Apple’s iPads and iPhones, and Samsung’s 
lineup of Galaxy phones. The processors go by brand names such as 
Cortex, Tegra, and Apple A7.
Intel offers an alternative energy-efficient processor technology for tablets 
and smartphones based on the Atom processor. This chip has the advan-
tage of using the same instruction set as x86 processors, which could 
potentially allow programs designed for desktops and laptops to also run on 
tablets and smartphones.

	 Which microprocessor is best? The microprocessor that’s best for 
you depends on your budget and the type of work and play you plan to 
do. The microprocessors marketed with the current crop of desktops and 
laptops can handle most business, educational, and entertainment applica-
tions. You’ll want to consider the fastest ­processor offerings if you engage in 
processing-hungry activities, such as 3‑D animated computer games, desk-
top ­publishing, multitrack sound recording, and video editing. 
	 What microprocessor is in my favorite device? If you know 
the make and model of a digital device, you can generally find processor 
specifications by searching online. For example, searching for processor 
specifications iPhone 5s reveals that the phone contains an A7 chip with 
64-bit architecture. 
Although phones and tablets require an online search, desktops and lap-
tops offer an easier way to discover exactly what’s inside (Figure 2-24).

How Processors Work
To appreciate the microprocessor specifications in your digital devices, it is 
handy to have a little background on how processors work. This key tech-
nology is quite fascinating in its ability to perform an astounding variety of 
tasks based on a set of really simple instructions.
	 What is the significance of microprocessor instruction sets? 
Microprocessors are hard-wired to perform a limited set of activities. 
This collection of preprogrammed activities is called an instruction set. 
Instruction sets are unique to processor families. x86 processors use a dif-
ferent instruction set than ARM processors. That is one reason why a game 
designed to run on a smartphone with an ARM processor cannot directly 
run on your laptop with its Intel i7 processor. 
	 What is in an instruction set? An instruction set contains a col-
lection of instructions for actions that the circuitry in a microprocessor can 
perform. The ARM instruction set contains about 35 instructions, whereas 
the x86 set includes more than 100 instructions. Each instruction carries 
out a seemingly insignificant task, such as moving a number from computer 
memory into the processor, or comparing two numbers to see if they are the 
same. Only when millions of these instructions are executed by the proces-
sor does a digital device seem to carry out any useful actions.
	 Are you talking about a computer program? Not exactly. Let’s 
use a game like Fruit Ninja as an example. This game is written by pro-
grammers using a programming language such as C++, BASIC, COBOL, 
or Java. When we think of a computer program, we think of the long list of 
statements written in one of these programming languages.
Surprisingly, microprocessors can’t directly understand these programming 
languages, so programs like Fruit Ninja have to be converted into machine 
language that corresponds to the microprocessor’s instruction set. These 
machine language instructions are binary strings of 0s and 1s that can be 
processed by a digital device.
	 What are machine language instructions like? Machine lan-
guage instructions are like baby steps. Take a look at the commonly used 
machine language instructions in Figure 2-25. It seems incredible that digi-
tal devices can carry out such a wide variety of tasks using such limited 
instructions.

SECTION C, Unit 2
	 What happens inside a computer chip? A microprocessor con-
tains miles of microscopic circuitry and millions of miniature components 
divided into different kinds of operational units, such as the ALU and the 
control unit.
The ALU (arithmetic logic unit) is the part of the microprocessor that 
performs arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction. It also 
performs logical operations, such as comparing two numbers to see if 
they are the same. The ALU uses registers to hold data that is being pro-
cessed. As an analogy, registers are similar to a mixing bowl you might 
use to hold the ingredients for a batch of cookies. 
The microprocessor’s control unit fetches each instruction, in the same 
way you might get ingredients for cookies out of a cupboard or the refrig-
erator. Data is loaded into the ALU’s registers, just like you add all the 
cookie ingredients to the mixing bowl. Finally, the control unit gives the 
ALU the green light to begin processing, just the way you flip the switch 
on your electric mixer to blend the cookie ingredients. Figure 2-26 illus-
trates a microprocessor control unit and its ALU preparing to add 5 + 4.
	 What happens when a computer executes an instruction? 
The term instruction cycle refers to the process in which a computer exe-
cutes a single instruction. Some parts of the instruction cycle are performed 
by the microprocessor’s control unit; other parts of the cycle are performed 
by the ALU. The steps in this cycle are summarized in Figure 2-27. 
 
1. Fetch an 
instruction.
2. Interpret the 
instruction.
3. Execute the 
instruction.
4. Go to the next 
instruction.

	 What role does the control unit play? The machine language 
instructions for a particular program are held in memory. When the program 
begins, the memory address of the first instruction is placed in a part of the 
microprocessor’s control unit called an instruction pointer. 
Figure 2-28 shows how the control unit can then go to the memory address 
(A) and fetch the instruction by copying data from that address into its 
instruction register (B). Next, the control unit interprets the instruction and 
executes it (C).
	 When does the ALU swing into action? The ALU is responsible 
for performing arithmetic and logical operations. As shown in Figure 2-29, 
the ALU uses registers to hold data that is ready to be processed. When it 
gets the go-ahead signal from the control unit (A), the ALU processes the 
data and places the result in an accumulator (B). From the accumulator, the 
data can be sent to memory or used for further processing. When the com-
puter completes an instruction, the control unit increments the instruction 
pointer to the memory address of the next instruction, and the instruction 
cycle begins again.

Performance
Now that you have some background on how microprocessors work, you 
can begin to appreciate what makes some microprocessors perform bet-
ter than others. A microprocessor’s performance is affected by several 
factors, including clock speed, number of cores, processing techniques, 
cache size, word size, and instruction set.
	 What does GHz have to do with processor performance? 
A processor specification, such as 3.4 GHz, indicates the speed of the 
­microprocessor clock—a timing device that sets the pace for executing 
instructions. Most computer ads specify the speed of a microprocessor in 
gigahertz. Gigahertz (GHz) means a billion cycles per second. A specifi-
cation such as 2.13 GHz means that the microprocessor’s clock operates 
at a speed of 2.13 billion cycles per ­second.
A cycle is the smallest unit of time in a microprocessor’s universe. Every 
action a processor performs is measured by these cycles. It is customary 
to equate clock cycles with the number of instructions a processor can 
execute per second. There is not always a one-to-one correspondence, 
however. Some instructions are processed within one clock cycle, but 
other instructions might require multiple cycles. Some processors can 
even execute several instructions in a single clock cycle.
You might expect a computer with a 2.13 GHz processor to perform 
slower than a computer with a 3.4 GHz processor. This is not necessar-
ily the case. Clock speed comparisons are only valid when comparing 
processors within the same chip family. A 2.13 GHz processor could 
outperform a 3.4 GHz processor. Why? Because factors other than clock 
speed contribute to the overall performance of a microprocessor.
	 What’s a multi-core processor? The “core” of a microprocessor 
consists of the control unit and ALU. A microprocessor that contains circuitry 
for more than one processing unit is called a multicore processor. Having 
more cores usually equates to faster performance. The 2.4 GHz Intel i5 pro-
cessor has two cores, giving it the equivalent of 4.8 GHz performance (2.4 x 
2). The 1.6 GHz Intel i7 processor has four cores, giving it the equivalent of 
6.4 GHz performance (1.6 x 4). Figure 2-30 illustrates a microscopic view of 
a processor with multiple cores.

	 Can a microprocessor execute more than one instruction 
at a time? Some processors execute instructions “serially”—that is, 
one instruction at a time. With serial processing, the processor must 
complete all steps in the instruction cycle before it begins to execute the 
next instruction. To use an analogy, visualize a pizzeria with one small 
oven. The pizzas are instructions; the oven is the microprocessor. Pizzas 
(instructions) are processed one at a time. 
Now, what if the pizzeria rigs up a conveyor-belt through the oven. A pizza 
(instruction) starts moving along the conveyor belt into the oven; but before 
it reaches the end, another pizza starts moving along the belt. When a pro-
cessor begins to execute an instruction before it completes the previous 
instruction, it is using pipeline processing. 
A pizzeria might also have large ovens that hold multiple pizzas. Just as 
these ovens can bake more than one pizza at a time, parallel process-
ing executes more than one instruction at a time. This efficient processing 
technology is possible with today’s multicore microprocessors. 
Pipeline and parallel processing offer better performance than serial pro-
cessing (Figure 2-31).

SECTION c, Unit 2
	 How does cache size affect performance? CPU cache 
(pronounced “cash”) is special high-speed memory that allows a micropro-
cessor to access data more ­rapidly than from memory located elsewhere 
on the system board. A large cache can increase processing performance. 
CPU cache is structured into several levels. Level 1 cache (L1) is the fast-
est, whereas Level 2 (L2) and Level 3 (L3) are slightly slower but still faster 
than accessing main memory or disk storage. Cache capacity is usually 
measured in megabytes.
	 What impact does word size have on performance? Word 
size refers to the number of bits that a microprocessor can manipulate at 
one time. It corresponds to the size of the registers used by the control 
unit and ALU. A processor with a 64-bit word size, for example, has regis-
ters that can process 64 bits at a time.
Word size also limits the amount of memory that the processor can 
access. Processors with a 32-bit word size can access a maximum of 4 
GB of memory, whereas processors with a 64-bit word size can poten-
tially access many terabytes of memory. 
A large word size gives processors the ability to handle more data dur-
ing each processing cycle—a factor that leads to increased performance. 
Today’s digital devices typically contain 32-bit processors or 64-bit pro-
cessors. In a computer with a 32-bit word size, registers that hold data 
and those that hold instructions all have capacity for 32 bits (Figure 2-32).

Figure 2-32: A register holds a 32-bit word
The bits in this 32-bit register could be an instruction or an item of data that 
is waiting to be processed.
	 How does an instruction set affect performance? As chip 
designers developed various instruction sets for microprocessors, they 
added increasingly complex instructions, each requiring several clock 
cycles for execution. A microprocessor with such an instruction set uses 
CISC (complex instruction set computer) technology. A microprocessor with 
a limited set of simple instructions uses RISC (reduced instruction set com-
puter) technology. 
A RISC processor performs most instructions faster than a CISC processor. 
It might, however, require more of these simple instructions to complete a 
task than a CISC processor requires for the same task. 
Most processors in today’s desktop and laptop computers use CISC tech-
nology. Many processors used in handheld devices, such as smartphones 
and tablets, are ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) processors.

random Access Memory 
RAM (random access memory) is a temporary holding area for data, 
application program instructions, and the operating system. RAM can be 
packaged in a chip carrier that is wired to the system board or it can be 
located on small circuit boards that plug into the system board. 
	 How much RAM does a device need? When purchasing a digi-
tal device, you may have a choice of RAM capacity. Higher RAM capacity 
adds to the expense of a device. RAM capacity is expressed in gigabytes. 
Today’s desktop and laptop computers typically feature 2–8 GB of RAM. 
Handheld devices usually have 1–2 GB of RAM.
	 But my smartphone has 64 GB, right? Your smartphone has 
RAM, but not 64 GB. The specifications for smartphones that describe 
“memory” capacity are not referring to RAM, but to another kind of storage 
that is more permanent. You’ll learn more about this type of storage in the 
next section. For now, let’s focus on RAM and why it is such an essential 
component of your favorite digital devices. 
	 Why is RAM so important? RAM is the “waiting room” for the 
microprocessor. It holds raw data waiting to be processed as well as the 
­program instructions for processing that data. RAM also holds the results 
of processing until they can be moved to a more permanent location on a 
hard disk, CD, or flash drive, or to cloud storage. 
In addition to data and application software instructions, RAM also holds 
operating system instructions that control the basic functions of a com-
puter system. These instructions are loaded into RAM every time you 
turn on a digital device, and they remain there until you turn off the device 
Figure 2-33.
	 How does RAM work? In RAM, microscopic electronic parts called 
capacitors hold the bits that represent data. You can visualize the capaci-
tors as microscopic lights that can be turned on or off. A charged capacitor 
is “turned on” and represents a “1” bit. A discharged capacitor is “turned off” 
and represents a “0” bit. A RAM address on each bank helps the computer 
locate data, as needed, for processing. 
Unlike disk storage, most RAM is volatile, which means it requires electri-
cal power to hold data. If the device is turned off, if the battery runs out of 
juice, or if a desktop computer is accidentally unplugged or experiences a 
power failure, all data stored in RAM instantly and permanently disappears. 
This type of RAM is technically classified as dynamic RAM (DRAM) but it is 
commonly referred to simply as RAM.

SECTION C, Unit 2
	 Can a device run out of memory? Suppose that you want to work 
with several programs and large graphics at the same time. Will your device 
eventually run out of memory? The answer is probably not. If a program 
exceeds its allocated space, the operating system uses an area of the hard 
disk or other storage device as virtual memory to store parts of programs 
or data files until they are needed. 
By selectively exchanging the data in RAM with the data in virtual mem-
ory, your computer effectively gains almost unlimited memory capacity. 
Too much dependence on virtual memory can decrease performance, 
however, especially if virtual memory is located on a relatively slow 
mechanical device, such as a hard disk drive.
Read-only Memory
ROM (read-only memory) is a type of memory circuitry that is housed in 
a single integrated circuit on the system board. Whereas RAM is tempo-
rary and volatile, ROM is more permanent and non-volatile. The contents of 
ROM remain in place even when the device is turned off. 
	 Why do digital devices have ROM? When you switch on a digi-
tal device, there is a waiting period while the device gets ready for use. 
While you are waiting, ROM is performing its role to “boot” the device. 
The boot process varies from one kind of device to another; but in gen-
eral, it begins when you press the power button and ends when the 
device is ready to use.
ROM contains a small set of instructions and data called the boot loader. 
The boot loader instructions tell a digital device how to start. Typically, 
the boot loader performs self-tests to find out if the hardware is operating 
properly and may also verify that essential programs have not been cor-
rupted. It then loads the operating system into RAM.
	 Why isn’t the boot loader stored in RAM? RAM requires 
power to hold data. When a device is off, RAM is empty. When you turn 
on the device, RAM is still empty and doesn’t contain any instructions for 
the microprocessor to execute. ROM, on the other hand, holds data even 
when the power is off. As Figure 2-34 shows, when you press the power 
button (A), your device can immediately access the instructions in ROM 
and proceed with the startup routine (B). Only when the startup is com-
plete can you access apps and data (C).

	 Can I change the contents of ROM? The process of changing the 
contents of ROM is sometimes called “flashing” because it is similar to the 
way a camera flash helps the camera capture an image. There are sev-
eral reasons that you might want to change the contents of ROM and boot 
loader instructions. 
Repair. Electrical surges and other hardware problems might corrupt the 
contents of ROM, which would prevent the device from powering on prop-
erly. Flashing the ROM to restore the boot loader instructions might correct 
the problem.
User modification. The boot loader may limit the programs that can be 
downloaded and run on a device. Flashing the ROM with a modified boot 
loader can bypass these limitations. The process is sometimes called “jail-
breaking” on iOS devices and “rooting” on Android devices. These ROM 
modifications may cause more problems than they solve and may void the 
device’s warranty.
Forensics. Tricky criminals may hide incriminating data in ROM or they 
may alter the boot loader so that it deletes incriminating files when the 
device is powered on by an unauthorized person. Investigators may want to 
examine the BIOS for hidden data, and they may have to flash the BIOS to 
restore it to a non-destructive state.
Updates. Device manufacturers offer updates to the boot loader as neces-
sary to patch security weaknesses. Such updates are performed by running 
a program supplied by the manufacturer. Be sure to back up your device 
before flashing, and carefully follow instructions for this procedure. If the 
flash fails, your device will not start until you get the ROM chip replaced. 
After a successful update (Figure 2-35), your device should boot normally.

storage basics
Storage is the term used for the components of a digital device designed 
to hold data permanently. Unlike RAM, storage is non-volatile and retains 
data even when the device is powered down. Storage is used to save doc-
uments, photos, and playlists. It also houses software and the operating 
system. Storage options for digital devices include hard drives, CDs, DVDs, 
flash drives, solid state drives, and memory cards.
	 What are the basic components of a data storage system? 
A data storage ­system has two main components: a storage medium and a 
storage device. A storage medium (storage media is the plural form) is the 
disk, tape, CD, DVD, paper, or other ­substance that contains data. A stor-
age device is the mechanical apparatus that records and retrieves data 
from a storage medium. The term storage technology refers to a storage 
device and the media it uses. 
Most digital devices have some built-in storage, such as a hard disk drive 
or solid state drive, that is permanently available as you use the device. 
Built-in storage can be supplemented by removable storage, such as flash 
drives, CDs, and memory cards.
	 Which storage technology is best? Each storage technology has 
its advantages and disadvantages. If one storage system were perfect, we 
wouldn’t need so many storage devices connected to our computers! To 
compare storage devices, it is useful to review their durability, dependabil-
ity, speed, capacity, and cost (Figure 2-36).
Terminology
The process of storing data is 
often referred to as writing data 
or saving a file because the 
storage device writes the data 
on the storage medium to save it 
for later use. 
The process of retrieving data 
is often referred to as reading 
data, loading data, or opening 
a file.
Durability
Resistance to damage from handling and 
environmental factors such as dust, humidity, heat, 
and cold. Can be measured in lifespan or in write 
cycles (the number of times data can be written 
and revised).
Dependability
Available when needed; not subject to breakdown, 
malfunction, network outages, or service 
interruptions. Can be measured by mean time 
between failures (MBTF is the time a device is 
expected to function before failing). Cloud storage 
service dependability can be measured by uptime 
(the percent of time the service is accessible).
Speed
The rate at which data can be stored or accessed. 
Faster is better. Can be measured by data transfer 
rate (the number of megabytes per second that 
are read or written by the storage device).
Capacity
The amount of data that can be stored, 
usually measured in gigabytes (GB) or 
terabytes (TB).
Cost
The price of the storage device and media, 
usually expressed per gigabyte (GB).

SECTION D, Unit 2
	 How much storage do I have? The amount of storage available 
on any of your digital devices depends on the capacity of built-in storage 
and the amount of data that is currently stored. Available storage space is 
sometimes referred to as “free space.” The process of finding the amount of 
free space depends on the device. Figure 2-37 can get you started.
	 How do storage technologies work? You can think of your 
computer’s storage devices as having a direct pipeline to RAM. Data gets 
copied from a storage device into RAM, where it waits to be processed. 
After data is processed, it is held temporarily in RAM, but it is usually copied 
to a storage medium for more permanent safekeeping. 
As you know, a computer’s processor works with data that has been coded 
into bits that can be represented by 1s and 0s. When data is stored, these 
1s and 0s must be converted into some kind of signal or mark that’s fairly 
permanent but can be changed when necessary. 
Obviously, the data is not literally written as “1” or “0.” Instead, the 1s and 0s 
must be transformed into something that can remain on a storage medium. 
Exactly how this transformation happens depends on the storage technol-
ogy. For example, hard disks store data in a different way than CDs. Three 
types of storage technologies are commonly used for personal computers: 
magnetic, optical, and solid state.

magnetic storage technology
Those big reels of tape that you see on computers in classic science fic-
tion movies are an example of magnetic storage technology used on data 
processing era mainframe computers. The first personal computers used 
cassette tapes for storage, though floppy disk storage was soon available. 
Today, magnetic storage technology is used for desktop and laptop hard 
disk drives, as well as the storage devices used in enterprise computing 
installations and cloud services.
	 What is magnetic storage technology? Magnetic storage 
represents data by magnetizing microscopic particles on a disk or tape 
surface. The particles retain their magnetic orientation until that orienta-
tion is changed, providing permanent but modifiable storage for data. 
Data stored magnetically can be easily changed or deleted simply by 
changing the magnetic orientation of particles on the disk surface. This 
feature of magnetic storage provides lots of flexibility for editing data and 
reusing areas of a ­storage medium containing unneeded data.
	 How does a hard disk drive work? A hard disk drive contains 
one or more platters and their ­associated read-write heads. A hard disk 
platter is a flat, rigid disk made of aluminum or glass and coated with mag-
netic iron oxide particles. 
The platters rotate as a unit on a spindle, making thousands of rotations 
per minute. Each platter has a read-write head that hovers just a few micro-
inches above the surface. A read-write head mechanism in the disk drive 
magnetizes particles to write data, and senses the particles’ polarities to 
read data (Figure 2-38).
Before data is stored on a hard disk, particles on the disk surface are scattered 
in random patterns. The disk drive’s read-write head orients them in a positive 
(north) or negative (south) direction to represent 0 and 1 bits, respectively.

	 Why are hard disk drives so popular? Hard disk drives can be 
installed inside a device or attached externally for additional storage capac-
ity or backup. Hard disk technology has three advantages. First, it provides 
lots of storage, with capacities ranging from 40 GB to 2 TB. Second, it pro-
vides fast access to files. Third, hard disk drives are economical. The cost 
of storing 1 gigabyte of data is about five cents.

Terminology
You might hear the term fixed 
disk used to refer to hard 
disks. You often see the terms 
hard disk and hard disk drive 
used interchangeably, though 
technically hard disk refers to 
the platters sealed inside the 
hard disk drive.

SECTION D, Unit 2
	 What’s the downside of hard disk storage? Data stored on 
magnetic media can be unintentionally altered by magnetic fields, dust, 
mold, smoke particles, heat, and mechanical problems with a storage 
device. Over time, magnetic media gradually lose their magnetic charge. 
Some experts estimate that the reliable lifespan of data stored on magnetic 
media is about three years. They recommend that you refresh your data 
every two years by recopying it. 
The read-write heads in a hard disk drive hover a microscopic distance 
above each platter. If a read-write head comes into contact with the platter, 
the head crash is likely to damage the platter and corrupt the data con-
tained on it. The causes of a head crash are explained in Figure 2-39. 
	 What should I know about hard disk drive specifications? 
Computer ads commonly specify the capacity, access time, and speed of 
a hard disk drive. For example, “2 TB 8 ms 7200 RPM HD” means a hard 
disk drive with a 2 terabyte capacity, an access time of 8 milliseconds, and a 
speed of 7,200 revolutions per minute. 
Access time is the average time it takes a computer to locate data on the 
storage medium and read it. Hard disk access times of 6 to 11 ms are not 
uncommon. Hard disk drives have much faster access times than CDs, 
which take about 500 ms to spin up to speed and find data. 
Hard disk drive speed is sometimes measured in revolutions per minute 
(rpm). The faster a drive spins, the more rapidly it can position the read-
write head over ­specific data. For example, a 7,200 rpm drive is able to 
access data faster than a 5,400 rpm drive.
When comparing hard disk drives to other storage technologies, data trans-
fer rates can be useful. Data transfer rate is the amount of data a storage 
device can move per second from the storage medium to RAM. Higher 
numbers indicate faster transfer rates. The average data transfer rate for a 
hard disk drive is about 57,000 KBps (also expressed as 57 MBps or MB/s).
Dropping a device may cause the read-write 
head to bounce off the surface of the platter, 
scraping off particles that represent data.
If dust particles or other contaminants 
seep into the drive case, they may 
come to rest on a platter where the 
read-write head will crash into them.

optical storage technology
Before the popularity of tablet computers and smartphones, just about 
every desktop and laptop computer included a storage device that handled 
CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. As devices became thinner and lighter, 
mechanical components such as these became less widespread. Yet opti-
cal technologies remain useful for archival storage, providing a permanent 
home for collections of documents, music, and photos that you might not 
trust to less robust storage technologies.
	 How does optical technology work? CD, DVD, and Blu-ray (BD) 
technologies are classified as optical storage, which represents data 
as microscopic light and dark spots on the disc surface. The dark spots 
are called pits. The lighter, non-pitted surface areas of the disc are called 
lands. 
Optical drives contain a spindle that rotates the disc over a laser lens. The 
laser directs a beam of light toward the underside of the disc. The pits and 
light on the disc surface reflect the light differently. As the lens reads the 
disc, these differences are translated into the 0s and 1s that represent data 
(Figure 2-40). 
As seen through an electron 
microscope, the pits on an opti-
cal storage disc look like small 
craters. Each pit is less than 
1 micron (one-millionth of a 
meter) in diameter—1,500 pits 
lined up side by side are about 
as wide as the head of a pin.

The drive spindle 
spins the disc.
A laser lens directs a 
beam of light to the 
underside of the disc.
A tracking mechanism 
positions a disc track 
over the laser lens.
	 How durable are optical discs? The surface of an optical disc is 
coated with clear plastic, making the disc quite durable and less suscep-
tible to environmental damage than data recorded on ­magnetic media. An 
optical disc, such as a CD, is not disrupted by humidity, fingerprints, dust, 
magnets, or spilled soft drinks. Scratches on the disc surface can interfere 
with data transfer, but a good buffing with toothpaste can erase the scratch 
without damaging the underlying data. 
Some optical discs have an estimated lifespan of at least 30 years, while 
other types of optical discs can probably hold data securely for up to 100 
years. When using optical technology for archival purposes, the archive 
should include an optical drive as well as the media containing data. The 
drive that recorded the data will have the best chance of reading it as the 
years go by.

SECTION D, Unit 2
 	 How do CD, DVD, and Blu-ray technologies differ? Optical 
media is inexpensive. A single optical drive typically handles CDs, DVDs, 
and Blu-ray discs, but the costs and capacities of these discs vary (Figure 
2-41). 
	 What’s the significance of ROM, R, and RW? Optical tech-
nologies are grouped into three categories: read-only, recordable, and 
rewritable. 
ROM. Read-only technology stores data permanently on a disc, which 
cannot be subsequently added to or changed. Read-only discs, such as 
CD-ROMs, CDDAs, DVD-Video, and DVD-ROMs, are mass produced and 
used to distribute software, music, and movies. These discs have the lon-
gest estimated lifespan, with the potential to hold stored data for more than 
100 years.
R. Recordable technology uses a laser to change the color in a dye layer 
sandwiched beneath the clear plastic disc surface. The laser creates dark 
spots in the dye that are read as pits. The change in the dye is permanent, 
so data cannot be modified once it has been recorded. The expected lifes-
pan for data stored on recordable discs is about 100 years.
RW. Rewritable technology uses phase change technology to alter a 
crystal structure on the disc surface. Altering the crystal structure creates 
patterns of light and dark spots resembling pits and lands. The crystal 
structure can be changed from light to dark and back again many times, 
making it possible to record and modify data much like on a hard disk. 
The term rerecordable (RE) is sometimes used instead of rewritable. RW 
technology is not as durable as ROM and R, so the estimated lifespan is 
about 30 years.
Figure 2-41: CDs, DVDs, and Blu-RAy Discs
Blu-ray (BD): Designed to hold 
high-definition 1080p video by

from the blue-violet colored laser 
used to read data stored on Blu-ray 
discs. DVD technology uses a red 
laser; CD technology uses a near 
infrared laser.
DVD (digital video disc or digital 
versatile disc): Originally designed 
for movies, but quickly adopted 
by the computer industry to store 
data. The initial DVD standard 
offered 4.7 GB (4,700 MB) of data 
storage. A double-layer DVD has 
two recordable layers on the same 
side and can store 8.5 GB of data. 
CD (compact disc): Originally 
designed to hold 74 minutes of 
recorded music. The original CD 
standard was adapted for com-
puter storage with capacity for 
650 MB of data. Later improve-
ments in CD standards increased 
the capacity to 80 minutes of

Solid State Storage technology
If you’re a typical digital device owner, you use solid state storage every 
day. You carry a flash drive and you might swap memory cards in a camera 
or tablet. The main storage for your smartphone is also based on solid state 
technology. 
	 What is solid state storage? Solid state storage (sometimes 
called flash memory) stores data in erasable, rewritable circuitry, rather 
than on spinning disks or streaming tape. Each data bit is held in a gate-like 
circuit that can be open or shut. 
Very little power is required to open or close the gates, which makes solid 
state storage ideal for battery-operated devices, such as digital cameras 
and media players. Once the data is stored, it is non-volatile—the circuits 
retain data without the need for an external power source. 
Solid state storage provides fast access to data because it includes no 
moving parts. This storage technology is very durable—it is virtually imper-
vious to vibration, magnetic fields, or extreme temperature fluctuations. It 
is also dependable. With no mechanical parts, it is less likely to fail than a 
hard disk drive. 
On the downside, the capacity of solid state storage does not currently 
match that of hard disks. The cost per megabyte of solid state storage is 
slightly higher than for magnetic or optical storage.
	 When should I use memory cards? A memory card is a flat, solid 
state storage medium commonly used to transfer files from digital cameras 
and media players to computers. The term memory card might lead you to 
believe that it is similar to random access memory (RAM). However, these 
cards are non-volatile, so they retain data even when they are disconnected 
from computers and other devices.
The formats for memory cards include CompactFlash, MultiMediaCard, 
Secure Digital (SD), and SmartMedia. A card reader is a device that reads 
and writes data on solid state storage. Sometimes referred to as 5‑in‑1, 
7-in-1, or all-in-one card readers, these combination devices work with mul-
tiple types of memory cards (Figure 2-42).

	 Do I need a solid state drive? A solid state drive (SSD) is a pack-
age of flash memory that can be used as a substitute for a hard disk drive. 
An SSD is installed inside the system unit and is not meant to be removed 
except for servicing. Some solid state drives are about the same size as a 
microprocessor chip; others are about the size of a small hard disk drive 
(Figure 2-43).
Figure 2-43: Solid State Drives
SSDs are widely used as the main stor-
age device in smartphones and tablet 
computers. Some laptops also include 
an SSD instead of a hard disk drive.

QuickCheck
Which of the following is a good 
substitute for a hard disk drive?
a.	 An SSD
b.	 A memory card
c.	 A USB flash drive
d.	 A DVD-RW
	 What should I know about USB flash drives? A USB flash drive 
is a portable storage device that plugs directly into a computer’s system unit 
using a built-in USB connector. Also called thumb drives, pen drives, jump 
drives, keychain drives, or UFDs, USB flash drives are about the size of a 
highlighter pen and so durable that you can literally carry them on your key 
ring. USB flash drives have capacities ranging from 16 MB to 256 GB. 
The data transfer rate of a USB flash drive depends on the USB ver-
sion. USB 1.0 is quite slow. USB 2.0 can read data at a rate of 800 Mbps, 
whereas USB 3.0 rates can reach 5 Gbps, rivaling hard disk drive speed. 
Cloud Storage
You probably use several digital devices. Suppose you stored class notes 
on your tablet, but you’ve left your tablet at home. It sure would be handy to 
access those notes from your phone. Cloud storage can make that happen.
	 What is cloud storage? Storage devices that are built into a digital 
device or that can be plugged directly into a device are classified as local 
storage. In contrast, remote storage is housed on an external device that 
can be accessed from a network. Remote storage may be available on a 
home, school, or work network. It can also be available as an Internet ser-
vice, in which case it is called cloud storage. 
Cloud storage is provided to individuals by services such as Apple iCloud, 
Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, and Dropbox. The basic concept is 
that files can be stored in a subscriber’s cloud-based storage area and 
accessed by logging in from any device. In a simple implementation, cloud 
storage functions just like a local drive (Figure 2-44).

Some cloud implementations offer a synchronization feature that automati-
cally duplicates files stored on a local device by also saving them in the 
cloud (Figure 2-45).
	 What should I know about cloud storage? The term cloud 
storage refers to a set of technologies for transporting, synchronizing, 
and managing data stored on banks of high-performance hard disk drives 
housed in the service provider’s data center.
Most cloud services offer a generous amount of free storage space, so the 
price is right. If you regularly use several digital devices and want to access 
your files from all of them, then cloud storage is an excellent solution. Also, 
if you procrastinate about backing up your devices, files stored in the cloud 
remain there even if a local device malfunctions. That being said, cloud 
storage has several drawbacks.
Security and privacy risks. The more places your data is stored and the 
more networks on which it travels, the more susceptible it becomes to inter-
cepts from hackers and government spying agencies. Carefully consider 
what you store in the cloud.
Service outages. When a cloud storage site has an outage, all the data 
stored there becomes temporarily inaccessible. If you have a term paper 
due in two days, it would be best not to trust the only copy to cloud storage 
where a two-day outage could make your files inaccessible until after the 
due date.
Discontinuation of service. Some cloud storage providers have shut-
tered their storage services with little warning to customers. Cloud storage 
may offer a convenient option for backing up your files, but don’t depend on 
it as the only backup.

SECTION D, Unit 2
Backup
Storage devices fail. Cloud storage services go dark. When they do, the 
data they contain might not be recoverable. To protect your data, you need 
backups. Do you have them? Do they contain the files you’ll need to resume 
work without a hitch?
	 What do I really need to back up? A backup is a copy of one or 
more files that is made in case the originals become damaged. Although 
the best practice might seem to be “back up everything,” that is not always 
practical. 
Your files are often scattered—some on a local hard disk, others on USB 
drives, some on your phone, and even others on cloud storage. Simply 
copying all of your files from one device to another or to the cloud requires 
lots of space and lots of time. Plus, there are some sticky technical issues 
that make it difficult to actually get a complete backup. To understand the 
problem, consider what a typical hard disk contains (Figure 2-46).
	 Then what should I do? The best advice is this: Know what’s 
important and ensure that current versions exist on more than one storage 
device. The easiest pairings of devices for backups are illustrated in Figure 
2-47.

Operating system: The operating system is required to 
start your device, but a backup copy might not run if it is 
unauthorized.
Software: Most devices are populated with preinstalled 
software, and you’ve probably downloaded and 
installed many additional apps. If these are wiped out 
when a storage device fails, the process of downloading 
and reinstalling them can be time consuming.
Data files: Your documents, photos, music, videos—all 
the goodies that you’ve created and gathered—can be 
difficult or impossible to reconstruct from scratch.
Settings, accounts, and profiles: How much time did 
you spend customizing your home screen, entering con-
tacts, choosing passwords, and setting preferences for

	 What tools do I need for backups? The tools you’ll need depend 
on what you are backing up and where you are putting the backups. If you 
are a typical consumer with a laptop and a smartphone, you will need a 
cloud storage account, an external hard disk drive, synchronization soft-
ware, a blank USB flash drive, and backup or disk imaging software.
	 I’ve got a Windows PC. What should I do? Windows users have 
access to several backup tools and will need to use more than one of them. 
Recovery drive. A recovery drive (or system repair disc) contains parts 
of the operating system necessary to boot your computer and diagnose 
system problems after a hard drive failure or software malfunction. Files 
for creating a recovery drive are usually preinstalled on the hard disk drive, 
but they won’t do you any good there when the hard disk fails. Follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions to move the recovery files to a blank USB flash 
drive, which you can store until it is needed.
Copy command. As you are working on important projects, make cop-
ies of essential files. You can store the copies on the same device as the 
originals using versioning techniques, such as adding “v2” and “v3” to the 
file names of versions. And for safety, periodically copy a version to a USB 
drive or to cloud storage. You can manually create copies of your data files 
using the Copy option in Windows File Explorer.
File History. Data file backup can be automated using File History, which 
is included with Windows 8.0 and subsequent versions. File History uses 
file synchronization to make copies of files from your Documents, Music, 
Pictures, and Videos folders, along with any files that were created or mod-
ified while OneDrive was offline. File History is useful if a data file goes 
missing, but it requires the System Image Backup option for system files, 
software, and settings. File History is easy to set up (Figure 2-48).
2. Select the System Image 
Backup option, then follow the 
prompts to select a location.
1. To activate File History, 
connect an external drive 
and then click the Turn 
on button.
File History can be configured to store backups on an external hard drive, a 
high-capacity USB flash drive, or a cloud storage service. The system image 
requires more space than is available on most USB flash drives.

SECTION D, Unit 2
System image. A disk image is a bit-for-bit copy of the data from all sec-
tors of a hard disk. Windows includes a disk imaging option called System 
Image that creates an exact clone of the original disk, including the oper-
ating system, your software, and all your settings. Be sure to select the 
System Image Backup option in the File History window to activate it. 
	 If my computer’s hard drive fails, how do I proceed? First, a 
new hard drive has to be installed. Then, as shown in Figure 2-49, (A) use 
the recovery drive to boot the computer. Then, (B) attach the backup drive 
containing your system image. Respond to the prompts displayed on the 
screen to copy the system image to the new hard disk.
	 I have a Mac. What’s my best backup option? Macs with OS X 
offer a comprehensive file synchronization utility called Time Machine, 
which backs up the entire hard disk, including system files, applications, 
accounts, preferences, email messages, music, photos, movies, and doc-
uments. Make sure that Time Machine is set to run in the background at 
all times while your computer is turned on.
If you need to restore a single file, you can open Time Machine, choose a 
file, then select the Restore option. To restore an entire backup, make sure 
the backup drive is connected and hold down the Command and R keys as 
the computer starts. Figure 2-50 illustrates the Time Machine.

may also be able to make backups of individual files. 
Owners of iOS devices can back up to a local computer using iTunes or 
to iCloud. The process is usually referred to as synchronization because it 
updates the files on the backup device with newer versions of files found on 
the smartphone or tablet. 
To activate iCloud backup, you can access Settings for your iOS device, 
tap iCloud, then select Storage & Backup. Slide the iCloud Backup button 
to On. To sync to a local drive using iTunes, simply connect the device to 
a desktop or laptop using a USB cable. Choose File, select Devices, then 
select Backup (Figure 2-51).

ADD-On Gadgets
If you have a basic smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop, then you know 
there is a tempting list of add-on gadgets to accompany these devices: for 
example, that fine set of Beats by Dr. Dre wireless headphones, a Nike 
FuelBand, an external optical drive, or Google Glass. There are lots of 
options.
	 What should I know about add-on gadgets? You’ll want to 
know what a gadget does and how well it works. You can discover relevant 
information from product reviews and customer ratings. You’ll also want to 
find out if the gadget will work with your devices, and you’ll need to know 
how to connect the gadget and get it working. A little general background 
about peripheral devices will smooth the way to successful gadget use.
	 What is a peripheral device? The term peripheral device is tech-
speak for devices such as printers, display devices, storage devices, mice, 
and headsets that are connected to the system unit of a computer. Although 
the term is falling out of use, it still pops up here and there, so it is worth 
knowing. Some modern nontechnical terms for peripheral devices include 
gadgets, add-ons, and accessories. Peripheral devices are classified as 
input, output, or mixed devices, as shown in Figure 2-52.
	 What can I connect to my devices? Many gadgets, such as 
earbuds, work with a wide variety of devices, including smartphones, smart-
watches, tablets, laptops, and desktops. Other gadgets are designed to 
work only with iPhones, for example. When shopping for gadgets, read the 
specifications and make sure they include your device.
	 What about connections? Add-on gadgets can connect to laptops, 
desktops, and handhelds using a cable or a wireless connection. Let’s take 
a look at commonly used connectors so that you can identify them on your 
devices.

SECTION E, Unit 2
EXPANSION PORTS
Like an ocean liner’s portholes, many digital devices have ports in the sys-
tem unit for connecting cables and various add-ons. Because these ports 
expand the options for input, output, and storage, they are commonly called 
expansion ports. When you plug in a USB flash drive or insert a memory 
card, you are using an expansion port.
	 How do expansion ports relate to the rest of the circuitry in 
a device? All of the components on the system board are connected by 
circuitry. The main circuits that carry data are called the data bus. These 
circuits carry data at lightning speeds as pulses of electrical voltages.
The part of the data bus that runs between the microprocessor and RAM is 
called the local bus or internal bus. This is the fastest part of the data bus 
because it has to keep up with the data demands of the microprocessor. 
The part of the data bus that stretches from RAM to various expansion 
ports is called the expansion bus. This part of the bus has several branches 
to accommodate data traveling to and from various ports (Figure 2-53).

processor?
a.	 Data first travels on the 
expansion bus, then switches 
to the data bus.
b.	 Data begins on the internal 
bus, then ends up on the 
local bus.
c.	 Data from the expansion 
bus reaches RAM, then it is 
transferred to the processor.
d.	 Data starts on the network 
bus, is processed in the CPU, 
then is sent to RAM.

	 What should I know about expansion ports? When making a 
connection between a peripheral device and a computer, the cable must 
connect to the proper expansion port. Ports are sometimes marked by tiny 
symbols that are difficult to see. You’ll want to be able to identify ports by 
their size and shape. 
From Section D, you are already familiar with the storage ports used for 
memory cards. You’ll also want to be able to identify general-purpose, 
video, audio, and network ports (Figure 2-54).

Which port would be the first 
choice for connecting a display 
device?
a.	 DVI
b.	 USB
c.	 Thunderbolt
d.	 Ethernet
Terminology
An adapter converts one type 
of connector to another. For 
example, a projector might 
have a DVI connector; but if 
your laptop has only a Mini 
DisplayPort, you can use an 
adapter to change the DVI plug 
to a Mini DisplayPort plug.
General-purpose ports are used for a variety of gadgets. For example, USB 
ports are general-purpose ports because they are used for storage devices, 
printers, speakers, toys, musical instruments, microphones, sound mixers, 
and fitness trackers, to name just a few. 
Some display devices, such as external display screens and projection 
devices, are designed to connect to USB ports, but other display devices 
use specialized video ports, such as HDMI, DVI, VGA, and DisplayPort. Using 
a specialized video port leaves USB ports free for other gadgets. 
Most devices have at least one 
Audio Out port for a headset 
or earbuds. There may be an 
additional Audio In port for 
connecting a microphone.
An Ethernet port handles wired 
network connections. Wireless net-
work connections are usually built 
in, but an antenna can be inserted  
in a USB port.

	 What is hot-plugging? When a peripheral device is connected or 
disconnected while the host device is operating, it is called hot-plugging. 
Although it is unnecessary to turn devices off before disconnecting them, 
some devices should not be disconnected while in the middle of data trans-
fers. Before unplugging a device, such as a USB flash drive, your computer 
might require notification. Figure 2-55 shows how to safely remove a USB 
drive.
Figure 2-56: A USB hub is handy for connecting lots of gadgets
USB hub
	 What if I run out of USB ports? If you want to connect more 
devices than the available number of USB ports, you can use a USB hub. 
A USB hub is an inexpensive device that turns one USB port into multi-
ple ports. It also saves wear and tear on USB ports caused by repeatedly 
inserting and removing USB devices (Figure 2-56).
Figure 2-55: How to safely eject USB Flash Drives
With Windows, use the File Explorer folder 
icon to view the flash drive icon. Right-
click it, then select Eject. You can remove 
the flash drive when the “Safe to Remove 
Hardware” message appears.
With OS X, use  
Finder to view  
the flash drive  
icon. Select the  
round Eject icon. It 
is safe to remove the 
flash drive when its

Bluetooth
Increasingly, gadgets are going wireless. Instead of exchanging data 
through a cable, devices can send signals through the air—no cable 
required. A common wireless technology for connecting peripherals is 
Bluetooth. 
	 What kinds of devices use Bluetooth? You’ll find Bluetooth 
options for connecting wireless keyboards and mice to laptops and desk-
tops. Nintendo and Wii game controllers also use Bluetooth.
Bluetooth is a low-power technology, so it is ideal for mobile devices that 
don’t have big batteries. Bluetooth is used to connect wireless headsets to 
smartphones. And if you’re into fitness, then your armband or smartshoes 
may transmit data to your phone or computer using Bluetooth technology.
	 What are the range and speed of Bluetooth? Bluetooth devices 
must be within 30 feet of each other. The peak data transmission rate is 3 
Mbps, which is suitable for sending small bursts of data rather than large 
files. Compared to wired connections, Bluetooth is quite slow (Figure 2-57).
Figure 2-57: Data transfer rates of popular connections
Thunderbolt 10 Gbps
USB 3.0 5 Gbps
FireWire 800 Mbps
USB 2.0 480 Mbps
Bluetooth 3 Mbps
	 Can I tell if a device is equipped with Bluetooth? Bluetooth is 
built into many smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops, but there is no 
corresponding physical port on the system unit. Look for the Bluetooth logo 
on the Windows taskbar or the Mac menu bar (Figure 2-58). For handheld 
devices, check Settings. If a device is not equipped with Bluetooth, you can 
plug a Bluetooth antenna into a USB port.

Device Drivers and Apps
Many gadgets have associated software. For example, there’s an iPhone 
app for your fitness wristband that graphs your progress and shares it with 
your training buddies. These applications help you get the most out of your 
gadgets. In addition to application software, devices also require a type of 
software called a device driver.
	 What’s a device driver? A device driver is software that helps a 
peripheral device establish communication with its host device. For exam-
ple, the device driver for an HP printer sets up data streams from RAM 
to the printer and makes sure that the data is formatted in a way that the 
printer can work with.
	 When do I have to install device drivers? Operating systems 
include built-in drivers for standard expansion ports. This feature, some-
times called Plug and Play, makes it easy to connect devices without 
manually installing device drivers. When you connect a new peripheral 
device, the operating system looks for an appropriate driver. If the device 
is unable to use a standard driver, you’ll be prompted to install the device 
driver supplied by the peripheral device manufacturer.
	 Where do I get device drivers? Device drivers, updates, and 
instructions for installing them are supplied on CDs by the device manufac-
turer. They can also be downloaded from the manufacturer’s Web site. 
	 When do I need a device driver update? Device drivers work 
directly with the host device’s operating system. A printer or other con-
nected gadgets might work perfectly—until the operating system gets an 
update. Then some device drivers might stop working correctly and the 
devices they control could malfunction. 
In addition to checking cables, trying a different port, and rebooting, one 
of the first steps in troubleshooting a malfunctioning peripheral device is to 
access the manufacturer’s Web site and look for a driver update. Updated 
driver downloads are usually available from the Support link (Figure 2-59).
Figure 2-59: Device driver updates are available online
QuickCheck
Suppose you just got an 
operating system update and 
now your printer has stopped 
working. What can you do to 
solve the problem? 
a.	 Go online and check for a 
printer driver update.
b.	 Connect the printer using a 
different port.
c.	 Reboot the computer.
d.	 All of the above
At most device manu-
facturer’s sites, you’ll 
find a support link 
where you can look for 
updated device drivers.

display devices 
A computer display device that simply displays text and images is clas-
sified as an output device. Touchscreens, however, can be classified as 
both input and output devices because they accept input and also display 
output. 
	 What are my options for display devices? Standalone display 
devices, sometimes called monitors, are popular for desktop computers. 
Display devices for laptops, tablets, and handheld devices are built into 
the system units, but these devices may also accept an external monitor. 
Two technologies are commonly used for display devices: LCD and LED. 
LCD ­(liquid crystal display) technology produces an image by filtering light 
through a layer of liquid crystal cells (Figure 2-60). The advantages of LCD 
screens include display clarity, low radiation emission, portability, and com-
pactness. The source of the light that filters through the LCD is referred to 
as backlighting. In a standard LCD screen, the source of this light is a series 
of cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs), which are not environmentally 
friendly. Gradually, CCFL backlighting is being replaced by LED (light-emit-
ting diode) technology. 
Figure 2-60: LCD displays
Andrey Burmakin/Shutterstock.com
Each dot, or pixel, on the 
screen contains three liq-
uid crystal cells: one red, 
one green, and one blue.
Controlling the levels of red, 
green, and blue produces 
various colors; in this case, 
orange. Liquid crystal cells 
produce no light on their 
own, so backlighting is used 
for illumination. 
	 What factors affect image quality? Image quality is a factor of 
screen size, response rate, dot pitch, and screen resolution. 
Screen size. Screen size is the measurement in inches from one corner 
of the screen diagonally across to the opposite corner. Screen sizes range 
from 1" for smartwatches to 60" or more for home entertainment systems.
Response rate. Response rate is the time it takes for one pixel to change 
from black to white then back to black. Display devices with fast response 
rates display a crisp image with minimal blurring or “ghosting” of moving 
objects. Response rate is measured in milliseconds (ms). For gaming sys-
tems, a response rate of 5 ms or less is desirable.
QuickCheck
The liquid crystal cells used in 
display devices do not directly 
emit light, so _____________ is 
necessary. 
a.	 backlighting
b.	 conversion
c.	 RGB
d.	 battery backup

SECTION E, Unit 2
Dot pitch. The LEDs that form an image on the screen are spaced in 
a grid. Dot pitch (dp) is the distance in millimeters between like-colored 
LEDs (Figure 2-61).
Screen resolution. The number of horizontal and vertical pixels that a 
device displays on the screen is referred to as screen resolution. The 
iPhone 5, for example, features a resolution of 1136 x 640. Another way to 
express resolution is pixels per inch (ppi). The 4-inch screen on an iPhone 
5s with Apple’s Retina display technology has a resolution of 326 ppi.
	 Should I set my computer on its highest resolution? Most dis-
plays have a recommended resolution at which images are clearest and 
text is crispest. On laptops and desktops, however, you can change the 
resolution. In Windows, you can use the Control Panel or right-click the 
desktop and select Screen Resolution. In OS X, use the Apple icon to 
open System Preferences and choose Displays. 
At higher resolutions, text and objects appear smaller, but the desktop 
appears more spacious. The two screens in Figure 2-62 help you com-
pare the same display set at two different resolutions.

	 How does a touchscreen work? Tablet computers, handheld 
devices, retail store self-checkouts, and ATMs display output and collect 
input from a touchscreen. Touchscreens display menus, scroll bars, and 
other controls. They can also display a virtual keyboard for devices that 
are not connected to a physical keyboard.
Touch events, such as taps, drags, and pinches, are sometimes called ges-
tures. The coordinates for a touch event are processed in essentially the 
same way as a mouse click. For example, if you touch your iPad screen 
at the location of a button labeled Calendar, the area you touch generates 
coordinates and sends them to the processor. The processor compares the 
coordinates to the image displayed on the screen to find out what is at the 
coordinates, and then responds—in this case, by opening your appoint-
ment calendar. The two most commonly used touchscreen technologies are 
resistive and capacitive (Figure 2-63). 
Figure 2-63: Touchscreens
QuickCheck
It was a cold day and you 
tried to use your smartphone 
while wearing gloves, but your 
gestures were ignored. The 
touchscreen on that device 
probably uses __________ 
technology.
a.	 capacitive
b.	 resistive
c.	 virtual
Capacitive technology contains a transparent panel coated with a thin layer 
of electrically conductive material. Because the human body is an electrical 
conductor, touching the screen produces a change in the electrical current. 
A special capacitive stylus or touchscreen gloves can also be used to operate 
this type of screen. Capacitive screens can interpret a single touch or more 
complex input such as handwriting. 
Screens built with resistive technology contain a 
base panel and a flexible top layer separated by a 
small space. Pressing slightly on the top layer brings 
it into contact with the base layer, and the point of 
contact is collected and passed to the processor. 
Resistive technology is not susceptible to dust or 
water, but it can be damaged by sharp objects.

	 What is a GPU? Display devices require graphics circuitry to gener-
ate and transport the signals for displaying an image on the screen. One 
type of graphics circuitry, referred to as integrated graphics, is built into a 
computer’s system board. A second option, called dedicated graphics, is 
graphics circuitry mounted on a small circuit board called a graphics card (or 
video card) like the one in Figure 2-64. 
A graphics card contains a graphics processing unit (GPU) and special 
video ­memory, which stores screen images as they are processed but 
before they are displayed. A fast GPU and lots of video memory are the 
keys to lightning-fast screen updating for fast action games, 3-D model-
ing, and graphics-intensive desktop publishing (Figure 2-65). 
A graphics card plugs 
into the system board 
inside the case of a 
desktop computer.
The video port protrudes from the back of 
the system unit so that the port is accessible 
for plugging in a display device.

printers 
The importance of printers has declined as digital distribution becomes 
more prevalent and cloud-based print services become more popular. Yet 
a printer can come in handy for creating printed documents, handouts, 
posters, and photos. Today’s best-selling multifunction printers use ink 
jet or laser technology and can also serve as scanners, copiers, and fax 
machines. 
	 How does an ink jet printer work? An ink jet printer has a 
nozzle-like print head that sprays ink onto paper to form characters and 
graphics. The print head in a color ink jet printer consists of a series of 
nozzles, each with its own ink ­cartridge (Figure 2-66). 
Most ink jet printers use CMYK color, which requires only cyan (blue), 
magenta (pink), yellow, and black inks to create a printout that appears to 
contain ­thousands of colors. 
Figure 2-66: Ink Jet CMYK cartridges 
Ink jet printers outsell all other types of printers because they are inexpen-
sive and produce both color and black-and-white printouts. They work well 
for most home and small business applications. Ink jet technology also pow-
ers many photo printers, which are optimized to print high-quality images 
produced by digital cameras and scanners.
	 How do laser printers compare to ink jet printers? A laser 
printer like the one shown in Figure 2-67 uses the same ­technology as a 
photocopier to paint dots of light on a light-sensitive drum. Electrostatically 
charged ink is applied to the drum and 
then transferred to paper. A laser printer 
prints faster than an ink jet printer, but laser 
technology is more complex than ink jet 
technology, which accounts for the higher 
price of laser printers.
A basic laser printer produces only black-
and-white printouts. Color laser printers 
are available, but they are somewhat more 
costly than basic black-and-white mod-
els. Laser printers are often the choice for 
business printers, particularly for applica-
tions that produce a high volume of printed 
material.

Things 
The utopian vision for the Internet of Things (IoT) is a busy hive of 
smart sensors that work behind the scenes to collect data and use it to 
improve—well—just about everything. All types of “things” equipped with 
smart sensors can monitor our homes, cars, and workplaces. They can 
also monitor our habits and physical fitness and communicate with each 
other while doing so. 
	 What are the basic features required for IoT devices? IoT 
devices require some way to communicate with other sensors and devices. 
That communication is handled by network technology, which is covered in 
the next unit.
IoT devices may include a microprocessor and memory if the device must 
process data, make decisions, or initiate an activity. A basic IoT circuit 
board contains one or more sensors, a power source, a transmitter, and an 
antenna  (Figure 2-68).
	 What types of smart sensors are available? The most popular 
IoT sensors send alerts based on data they collect (Figure 2-69).

QUICKQUIZ
 SECTION E
	 Where can I get IoT devices? Smart sensors are available in elec-
tronics stores, hardware stores, and online. Some of these sensors are 
no-strings-attached straight-up purchases, whereas others require registra-
tion through a centralized Web site and perhaps even monthly subscription 
fees, similar to security monitoring services offered by the security company 
ADT. 
	 Do sensors have security risks? Sensors themselves would not 
generally be a security risk. What happens to the data they collect, how-
ever, can pose security and privacy risks.  
According to an NPR story, one of the show’s producers obtained a smart 
thermostat that allowed him to control the temperature in his apartment 
using his smartphone. The thermostat was provided free of charge by his 
electric company. 
Why would an electric company, whose business is to sell power, offer 
devices that help customers use less power? The answer is that the smart 
thermostat sends power usage data to the electric company. 
When that data is aggregated anonymously with other customers, it poses 
little risk and is useful for helping the power company gauge usage lev-
els. However, the non-anonymized data stored in customer accounts can 
pose security risks. That data could be used to determine when a customer 
leaves the house (heat is turned down), arrives home (heat is turned up), or 
goes on vacation (heat remains down for several days). 
The NPR story also revealed that the electric company can not only collect 
data from the smart thermostats but can also control them. The company is 
able to override the owners’ settings when the power grid reaches capacity.
When considering smart sensors, take care to understand where their data 
can be stored, who can access the data, and who can control the device. To 
maximize security, select sensors that store data locally or on a secure site. 
In addition, confirm that all data is encrypted before it is transmitted and 
stored, and ensure it can be controlled only by you.
QuickCheck
Which one of the following 
aspects of smart sensors on the 
IoT would be the least likely to 
pose a security risk?
a.	 Anonymized data
b.	 Data transmitted without 
encryption
c.	 Data stored on a Web site
d.	 Temperature sensors 
supplied by your electric 
service provider

Issue: Where Does All the Ewaste Go?
In the west african nation of Ghana, 
smoldering piles of discarded computers and moni-
tors ring a mucky river, polluted beyond recovery. 
Teenage boys play soccer in a toxic haze. When their 
break is over, they get back to work smashing moni-
tors, ripping out the innards, and tossing the plastic 
cases onto a smoking pyre of oozing plastic. 
In Guiyu, China, thousands of women huddle over 
primitive stoves “cooking” circuit boards to retrieve 
trace amounts of gold. Toxic fumes from the cooking 
process cloud the air; a toddler showing symptoms of 
lead poisoning plays listlessly with the carcasses of 
discarded mice and cell phones.
It is called ewaste, e-garbage, or technotrash—all 
unwanted and outdated computers, monitors, printers, 
cell phones, disk drives, disks, 
CDs, and DVDs. According to 
the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), 3 million tons 
of ewaste is discarded every 
year. In the United States alone, almost eight printer 
cartridges are discarded every second, and millions 
of CDs and DVDs end up in landfills every year. 
Computers and other electronic gear contain toxic 
substances such as lead, cadmium, and mercury. 
When discarded equipment is buried in landfills, these 
substances can leach into groundwater and streams. 
When burned, electronic components can emit toxic 
dioxin. 
Ewaste is a global problem. As countries struggle 
to deal with discarded electronic components, an 
alarming amount of ewaste is shipped to developing 
countries where villagers, working for pennies a day, 
are exposed to toxic chemicals as they attempt to 
reclaim resalable metals from discarded equipment. 
Throughout the emerging world, ugly ewaste dumps 
defile the landscape and have yet unknown health 
effects. 
Where does all this ewaste originate? Every coun-
try generates ewaste, but the bulk of it comes from 
prosperous, technology-forward countries such as 
the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, 
France, and China. Despite laws that ban ewaste 
transhipping, loopholes allow discarded but work-
ing electronics to be shipped as “donations.” Tons 
of donations arrive every day in port cities, such as 
Hong Kong, where they follow a shadowy route to 
unregulated workshops and dump sites.
Some illegal ewaste originates in legitimate recycling 
centers, where consumers assume electronic com-
ponents will be handled in environmentally friendly 
ways. Many recycling centers do not process mate-
rials on site. Instead, they ship the ewaste to third 
parties. Without careful monitoring, that ewaste can 
be diverted to offshore locations where it piles up, 
waiting to be disassembled by backstreet laborers 
ungoverned by environmental protection regulations.
Developed countries have strict environmental regu-
lations designed to prevent toxic substances from 
polluting air, land, and water. Proper disposal is 
expensive, however. 
In countries with high 
labor costs and strin-
gent environmental 
regulations, the value 
of compounds retrieved from ewaste does not cover 
the cost of extraction.
The high cost of properly processing ewaste makes 
gray market options attractive. Ewaste can be han-
dled more cost-effectively in emerging countries 
where environmental regulations are ignored, wages 
are pitiful, and workers are not covered by health and 
safety laws. 
So, who is responsible for ewaste sweatshops and 
pollution? Is it consumers in developed countries who 
deposit unwanted gear at recycling stations that don’t 
carry out the recycling process in-house, or is it the 
recycling firms that ship ewaste to third parties? Is it 
the firms that ship ewaste to emerging countries or 
the governments that can’t close the loopholes on 
ewaste transhipping? 
Perhaps the responsibility lies with emerging coun-
tries that are unable to control ewaste sweatshops 
and ignore the resulting environmental and human 
casualties.
Wherever the blame lies, consumers who are aware 
of the problem can become more responsible in the 
way they dispose of unwanted gear to keep it out of 
landfills at home and offshore.

1. Have you ever thrown away an old computer or other ­electronic device? 
2. Do you research products before you purchase them to find out if they 
are environmentally friendly throughout their life cycle?
3. Would it be fair for consumers to pay a recycling tax on electronic equip-
ment that they purchase?
What Do You Think?
 ISSUE
TRY IT! Explore the ewaste issue. Watch a video of the Ghana crisis and explore the steps you can 
take to minimize the number of electronic components that end up in landfills and toxic waste dumps. 
	A group of graduate journalism students from the University of British Columbia investigated the illicit 
ewaste industry. Their story is presented in a Frontline World report located at www.pbs.org/frontline-
world/stories/ghana804/video/video_index.html. Watch the video. Where do the researchers drop off 
the ewaste, and where does it end up?
	 Many computers, mobile phones, and other electronic components pile up in landfills because their own-
ers are unaware of potential environmental ­hazards and simply toss them in the garbage. Use Web sites 
such as Earth911.com, or search for recycling computers and add your city name as in recycling comput-
ers Chicago. Where is the nearest drop-off location for old laptop computers? Would you be charged a 
fee, and if so, how much?
	 Before donating or discarding a computer, you should erase all the data it contains. Simply deleting files 
is not sufficient to prevent data from being recovered. Search online for information about deleting or “wip-
ing” the data from a hard drive. What are three ways you can securely prevent access to the data on a 
hard disk?
	 Consumers can select “green” products and purchase equipment from environment-friendly manufac-
turers. Check out Greenpeace’s Green Ranking. What is the ranking for the company that manufactured 
your computer? 
	 You might wonder if the computer you are currently using is environmentally friendly. The Green 
Electronics Council rates specific computer models as bronze, silver, or gold. Connect to the EPEAT 
site (www.epeat.net), click Search the Registry, then drill down to find your computer. What is the rat-
ing for your computer brand and model?

You’re looking for information. Where you start depends on how you plan to use the information. The sources 
you need for a class research paper often differ from information sources for personal use.
Information sources can be roughly divided into two categories: those that serve academic audiences and 
those that serve consumers.
Can’t access what you need for a research project? Here are some common problems encountered by stu-
dents, and solutions that help you find the resources you need for a paper that earns you an A.
PROBLEM: Web search engines, such as Google, sometimes miss many of the articles most relevant for a 
college-level research project because articles are often locked behind paywalls or firewalls that don’t allow 
search engine access. SOLUTION: Go directly to a journal’s Web site and search there.
PROBLEM: Many scholarly journals display only abstracts to the general public; viewing the full text of articles 
requires a subscription or download fee. SOLUTION: Use your library’s online database to locate articles that 
are included in the physical collection. You might have to go to the library to read the articles or ask for the full 
article from inter-library loan.
PROBLEM: Access to academic search engines and databases, such as LexisNexis, requires subscriptions. 
SOLUTION: Your school might provide registered students with free access to journal databases if you log in 
from a computer on the school network or from within the library.

TRY IT! Research about computers and technology relies on 
information from a broad base of sources. Let’s explore these sources by 
comparing what they offer. Some searches will produce information suit-
able for academic projects, such as term papers, while other searches tend 
to produce information suitable for personal use, such as figuring out if 
someone is hacking into your home network.
To record the results of this comparison, write down (or screen capture) 
one example that you get from each source, and then describe an aca-
demic project or personal use for which that information would be suitable. 
As an example, suppose that you search for cloud computing using Google 
Scholar and one of the results is: 
This information is academic and could be a suitable source for a term 
paper about cloud computing in a computer science course. Okay, now see 
what you can do with the rest.

Technology in Context: Military
In “Engines of the Mind,” Joel 
Shurkin writes, “If necessity is the mother of invention, 
then war can be said to be its grandmother.” The mili-
tary, an early pioneer in computer and communication 
technologies, continues to be the driving force behind 
technologies that have revolutionized everyday life. 
During World War II, the U.S. military initiated a clas-
sified research program, called Project PX, to develop 
an electronic device to calculate artillery firing tables; 
by hand, each table required weeks of grueling calcu-
lations. 
Project PX produced ENIAC (Electronic Numerical 
Integrator And Computer), one of the first general-
purpose electronic computers. When ENIAC was 
completed in 1946, the war was over, but ENIAC’s 
versatile architecture could be used for other calcula-
tions, such as designing hydrogen bombs, predicting 
weather, and engineering wind tunnels. ENIAC’s tech-
nology evolved into the computers used today. 
After Project PX, the military continued to support 
computer research. Like most large corporations, the 
military used mainframe computers to maintain per-
sonnel, inventory, supply, and facilities records. This 
data was distributed to terminals at other locations 
through rudimentary networks. 
Because all data communication flowed through the 
mainframe, a single point of failure for the entire sys-
tem was a possible risk. A malfunction or an enemy 
“hit” could disrupt command and control, sending the 
military into chaos. Therefore, the armed forces cre-
ated the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) 
to design a distributed communications system that 
could continue operating without a centralized com-
puter. 
The result was ARPANET, which paved the way for 
the data communications system we know today as 
the Internet. ARPANET was activated in 1967, but the 
.mil domain that designates U.S. military Web sites 
was not implemented until 1984.
The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) currently 
maintains several data communications networks, 
including SIPRNet, a classified (secret-level) network, 
and NIPRNet, which provides unclassified services. 
The DoD’s public Web site provides official informa-
tion about defense policies, organizations, budgets, 
and operations.
Computers and communications technology have 
also become an integral part of high-tech flight oper-
ations. U.S. Apache helicopters, for example, are 
equipped with computer-based Target Acquisition 
Designation Sights, laser range finder/designators, 
and Pilot Night Vision Sensors. 
Networks are also crucial for combat operations, and 
a new generation of communication tools is evolv-
ing for soldiers deployed to battlefields. Networked 
communication devices offer immediate situational 
awareness by providing critical information such 
as orders, imagery, graphics, and maps. The U.S. 
Army’s $150 million Nett Warrior program is essen-
tially a smartphone carried by the dismounted soldier 
that displays the locations of friendly troops and facili-
tates text messaging when verbal communication is 
not possible.

Combat equipment for today’s soldiers includes 
“software-defined” radios that are less vulnerable to 
cyberthreats than conventional radios. Soldiers can 
use these radios to communicate voice and data. 
A small handheld device with a touchscreen allows 
soldiers to control unmanned robots and drones. A 
solar backpack supplements the battery-powered 
device. Combat equipment also includes wearable 
devices, such as helmet-mounted displays and com-
munications devices. 
The military has conducted 
research in computer simulations 
that are similar to civilian computer 
games. “Live” military training is dan-
gerous—weapons are deadly and 
equipment costs millions of dollars. 
With computer simulations, however, 
troops can train in a true-to-life envi-
ronment without physical harm or 
equipment damage. 
Flying an F-16 fighter, for example, 
costs thousands of dollars an hour, 
but flying an F-16 simulator costs 
only a few hundred dollars per hour. 
The military uses simulators to teach 
Air Force pilots to fly fighter jets, 
Navy submarine officers to navi-
gate in harbors, and Marine infantry 
squads to handle urban combat. Military trainers 
agree that widespread use of computer games helps 
prepare troops to adapt quickly to simulations. 
A 24-year-old preflight student at Pensacola Naval 
Air Station modified the Microsoft Flight Simulator 
game to re-create a T-34C Turbo Mentor plane’s 
controls. After logging 50 hours on the simulator, the 
student performed so well on a real plane that the 
Navy used his simulation to train other pilots.
The military is quick to borrow civilian technologies 
that make combat teams safer and more effec-
tive. Soon after Google Glass was released to the 
general public, the U.S. Navy contracted with a 
multinational eyewear company to integrate high- 
definition display technology into standard military 
goggles. Hands-free data access and video record-
ing capabilities permit sailors to perform tasks 
without pausing to deal with communications equip-
ment.
The U.S. Navy also seeks help from civilian devel-
opers—even college students. In the annual 
International RoboBoat competition, a $20,000 
prize is awarded for the best-designed ships that 
can operate without crews in harsh environments or 
dangerous situations.
Today, a growing cadre of computer and communi-
cations specialists is needed to create and maintain 
increasingly complex military systems such as the 
Defense Department’s Distributed Common Ground 
System (DCGS) for sharing surveillance imagery 
and intelligence. 
Armies once depended primarily on their infantry 
divisions, but today’s high-tech armies also depend 
on database designers, computer programmers, 
and network specialists. Even previously low-tech 
military jobs, such as 
mechanics and dieti-
tians, require some 
computer expertise. 
Happily, new recruits 
are ­finding military 
computer systems 
easy to learn based 
on their knowledge of 
civilian technologies, 
such as the Internet 
and computer games.
Although most citi-
zens recognize that 
an adequate national 
defense is necessary, 
the cost of defense-
related equipment, 
personnel, and cut-
ting-edge research remains controversial. In a 1961 
speech, President Dwight Eisenhower warned “We 
must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted 
influence, whether sought or unsought, by the mili-
tary-industrial complex.” 
Some socially motivated citizens and pacifists tried 
to withhold tax dollars from the military-industrial 
complex that Eisenhower cautioned against. In ret-
rospect, however, military funding contributed to 
many technologies we depend on today. 
For example, detractors tried to convince the gov-
ernment that Project PX was doomed to failure; 
but without ENIAC research, computers might not 
exist today. Skeptics saw no future for the fruits of 
ARPANET research; but it led to the Internet, which 
has changed our lives significantly.

Flipped Class Projects
Critical Thinking
For many years, personal computers were desktop 
models designed around four main components: 
system unit, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Today, 
more than half the devices we use are slate form 
factors without physical keyboards. Some indus-
try analysts speculate that the move away from 
physical keyboards signals a fundamental change 
in the use of digital devices. Whereas computers 
were once seen as tools for producing, they are 
now becoming tools for consuming. How significant 
is a physical keyboard to the creative and produc-
tive use of digital devices? What kinds of evidence 
would help to support your opinion? 
Group Project
For this project, work in groups of three or four. 
The group should select a trending digital device, 
such as a fitness wristband, a smartwatch, smart-
glasses, a home security system, or a just-released 
smartphone. If a member of your group owns the 
device, that’s a plus. Create promotional materi-
als for a tradeshow booth featuring your device. 
You might include a product photo, a list of speci-
fications, and a short instruction manual. If time 
permits, your instructor might ask your group to 
present your sales pitch or a demonstration to the 
rest of the class.
Cyberclassroom
Work in pairs to set up a cloud-based storage loca-
tion where you can share files. Experiment with the 
following scenarios to find out what happens: 
1) Two people access the same file at approxi-
mately the same time; neither person changes the 
file contents.
2) While one person is modifying a file, another 
person tries to access the file but does not try to 
modify it.
3) While one person is modifying a file, a second 
person attempts to access it and change it.
Multimedia Project
Imagine that you are a high school teacher and you 
have to design materials to teach a unit on how 
microprocessors work. To kick off the unit, create 
a 30- to 60-second video showing the control unit, 
registers, and ALU, and how an instruction like ADD 
9 +2 would be processed. Be creative and make it 
interesting!
Resume Builder
Use the Web and other resources to learn about 
the digital devices and other technologies used in 
your career field. Format the information you find in 
a style similar to the Technology in Context section 
of each unit in this textbook. Be sure to select two 
photos to accompany your narrative and include a 
list of relevant citations for your sources.
Globalization
Digital device ownership is growing worldwide and 
providing access to productivity tools and a global 
communications infrastructure. For this project, 
look for statistics and graphs showing the increase 
in device ownership around the world over time. 
How does it compare to telephone, television, 
and radio ownership? Are any aspects of this data 
unexpected or surprising? Gather your graphs 
and analysis into a two- to three-page executive 
summary.

Section A: A computer is a multipurpose device 
that accepts input, processes data, stores data, and 
produces output, all according to a series of stored 
  . The 
 
processing unit of most modern computers is a(n) 
 .The instructions that tell a 
computer how to carry out a task are referred to as com-
puter 
 , which are distributed 
as software. Computers run three main types of software: 
 software, system software, and 
development tools. An example of system software is a com-
puter 
 system, which is essentially 
the master controller for all the activities that a digital device 
performs. Digital devices are constructed using tiny electronic 
components that represent data bits as electrical signals. The 
system unit houses the system board, which contains several 
 circuits made from semiconduct-
ing materials. Computers come in three popular form factors: 
component, 
 , and slate. Many of 
today’s digital devices operate on battery power supplied by 
 ion batteries. Battery life and lifes-
pan can be extended by following good battery management 
practices.
SECTION B: Today, there are many computer cat-
egories. A(n) 
 is the category for 
the world’s fastest computers. 
 
computers are large, expensive devices capable of simulta-
neously processing data for thousands of users. Computers 
used by Google and Web service providers are classified as 
 . Personal computers come in sev-
eral varieties. A(n) 
 computer fits 
on a desk, runs on power from an electrical wall outlet, and 
can be housed in a horizontal case or vertical case. Three 
categories of portable computers include tablets, smart-
phones, and clam-shell style 
 
computers. Selecting a digital device requires consumers to 
select a platform based on form factor and operating system. 
OS X is the operating system that runs on Apple laptops and 
 computers. The operating system 
for iPhones and iPads is 
 . The 
 operating system from Microsoft 
runs on laptop and desktop PCs, whereas a derivative ver-
sion is designed for tablets and phones. The open source 
community produces Linux for desktops and servers. This 
family of operating systems also includes Chrome OS, and 
 , which is popular for tablets and 
smartphones.
SECTION C:  T h e  m i c r o p r o c e s s o r  i s  a ( n ) 
 circuit, which is designed to pro-
cess data based on a set of instructions. Most desk-
top and laptop devices contain a microprocessor based 
on the 
 standard. Most tab-
lets and smartphones contain processors based on 
 technology. A microproces-
sor’s circuitry is designed to perform a limited number of 
tasks contained in its 
 set. During 
processing, an instruction is loaded into the processor’s 
 unit. Data is loaded into registers 
in the processor’s 
 where arith-
metic and logic operations are performed. Microprocessor 
performance can be measured by its 
 
speed. Other factors affecting overall processing performance 
include word size, cache size, and instruction set complex-
ity. Most digital devices contain only one microprocessor chip, 
but today’s multi- 
 processors contain 
circuitry that supports parallel processing. Computers con-
tain various kinds of memory. Random 
 
memory is a special holding area for data, program instruc-
tions, and the 
 system. It stores data 
on a temporary basis until the processor makes a data 
request. RAM is different from disk storage because it is 
 , which means that it can hold data 
only when the computer power is turned on. Computers also 
contain read- 
 memory, which is a type 
of non-volatile memory that provides a set of “hard-wired” 
instructions, called the 
 loader, that 
a computer uses to boot up.

SECTION E:  Inside a digital device, a data 
 connects the processor to RAM, and 
connects RAM to a series of expansion 
 . 
There are three technologies commonly used for 
general-purpose ports: Thunderbolt, FireWire, and 
  . For video devices, the most com-
mon ports are VGA, DVI, 
 , and Mini 
DisplayPort. Peripherals can be inserted or removed while 
the host device is on, but storage devices should not be 
removed without notification. To connect additional peripher-
als when all USB ports are full, it is possible to use a USB 
 . Some peripherals can be connected 
wirelessly using 
 technology. The soft-
ware that helps a peripheral device establish communication 
with its host device is called a device 
 . 
Most devices include a(n) 
 crystal dis-
play. Image quality for a display device is a factor of screen 
size, response rate, dot 
 , and resolu-
tion. Touchscreens use either 
 or capac-
itive technology to process gestures. Display devices receive 
images from graphics circuitry. A(n) 
 and 
special video memory can enhance graphics processing and 
free the main processor for other tasks. For printed output, 
most personal computer owners select 
 
jet printers, though 
 printers are a popu-
lar option when low operating costs and high duty cycle are 
important. 
SECTION D: Today’s digital devices use a variety of 
storage technologies. 
 storage tech-
nologies, such as hard disks, store data as particles ori-
ented north or south. A hard disk drive provides multiple 
 for data storage that are sealed inside 
the drive case to prevent airborne contaminants from inter-
fering with the read-write heads. Hard disks are less durable 
than many other types of storage, so it is important to make 
a copy of the data they contain. 
 storage 
technologies store data as a series of 
 
and lands on the surface of CDs, DVDs, or BDs. Storage 
technologies, such as CD- 
 , are often 
used for distributing software, but you cannot alter the disc’s 
contents. 
 technology allows you to 
write data on a CD, DVD, or BD, but you cannot delete or 
change that data. Rerecordable or 
 
technology allows you to write and erase data on a CD, 
DVD, or BD. 
 state storage technolo-
gies, such as USB flash drives, store data by activating elec-
trons in a microscopic grid of circuitry. A backup is a copy 
of one or more files that have been made in case the original 
files become damaged. A good backup plan allows you to 
restore a device’s operating system, software, data files, set-
tings, accounts, and profiles in case of a massive hardware 
failure or virus infection. Personal computer backups are typi-
cally recorded on 
 hard drives, USB 
flash drives, network servers, and online storage services. An 
easy way to get a backup of important data files is to use the 
 command to make duplicates and store 
them on a USB drive. Backup utilities such as File History and 
Time Machine use a technique called file 
 
to make sure that files on two devices are the same. A disk 
 is a bit-for-bit copy of the data from all 
sectors of a hard disk.

Interactive Situation Questions
1.	
Suppose you’re reading a computer magazine and you 
come across the ad pictured to the right. By looking 
at the specs, you can tell that the microprocessor was 
manufactured by which company? 
2.	
The capacity of the hard disk drive in the ad is 
 GB and the memory capacity is 
 GB.
3.	
Your friends are chatting about a low-cost laptop that 
“runs Google.” You figure that they are actually talking 
about a device called a(n) 
 that runs 
Google’s Chrome OS as its operating system.
4.	
Looking over the specs for a new clamshell-style 
device, you notice that it contains a Cortex ARM-based

THE microprocessor clock is ticking. Data bits are flying in and out of RAM and zooming over the data 
bus to a storage device. All that seems invisible, but wait! You can get an idea of what’s going on inside the system unit. 
Who needs to know? You might. If you suspect your computer has a virus. If you think your computer might have been 
compromised by a botnet. If your computer seems sluggish. Windows and OS X include monitoring utilities that provide 
all kinds of information about your computer’s status.
REQUIREMENTS: 
For this lab, you’ll need a desktop or laptop computer running either Windows or OS X. The instructions are general-
ized; they provide helpful guidelines, but not specific steps. You may have to explore a bit to find all the tools needed to 
complete the assignment, but that is all part of the learning experience. 
ASSIGNMENT:
 Open your computer’s monitoring utility. 
On a Mac, select the Applications folder from the dock. 
Select the Utilities folder, then select Activity Monitor.
On a PC with Windows, make sure you are at the Home 
screen. Use the Search box to find and launch Task 
Manager.
 Examine your computer’s CPU usage.
On a Mac, select the CPU tab; on Windows, select the 
Performance tab. 
CPU utilization is expressed as a percentage of total pro-
cessing capability. If CPU utilization exceeds 10% when 
you are not using software, it might signal a security 
breach. Temporary spikes are normal; and when you are 
playing 3-D games or using compute-intensive software, 
the usage could remain above 70%. 
What is the current CPU utilization on your device?
 Check processes.
On a Mac, processes are listed on the CPU tab; on 
Windows, select the Processes tab.
A process corresponds to a program. Any programs that 
are currently running put a load on the CPU. 
What is the process with the highest CPU usage? Do you 
recognize the program associated with this process? If 
not, look it up online.
 Check for malware.
Some processes are launched by the operating system 
rather than application software. If you don’t recognize a 
process, you can find out if it is legitimate by checking 
online.
Select a process with an unusual name and search for it 
online. What is its name and what does it do?
 Check memory.
On a Mac, select the Memory tab; on Windows, remain 
on the Processes tab.
As you know, RAM holds the operating system, pro-
grams, and data, but the amount of stuff that’s actually in 
RAM is pretty surprising.
Find the listing for Kernel_task (Mac) or System 
(Windows). That process is part of the operating system. 
How much memory is it using?
What is the name of the software application that uses 
the most memory?
 Check storage.
On a Mac, choose the Disk tab; on Windows, remain on 
the Processes tab.
Programs send data to storage even when you are not in 
the process of manually saving files. Some programs cre-
ate autorecovery files as temporary backups, and Web 
pages write cookies. 
Find a process that is writing data to disk even when you 
are not actively using it. What is the name of that process 
and what is its purpose?

Communication systems
You use many networks for communication, research, and entertainment. 
Some networks are large and some are small. The largest networks offer 
little control to consumers. Smaller networks that you set up can be com-
pletely under your control, but they are also your responsibility. Networks 
can be classified in many ways; as a network user, you’ll want to keep in 
mind the idea of control and how it affects your privacy and security.
	What is a network? A network links things together. A communica-
tion network (or communication system) links together devices so that 
data and information can be shared among them. 
In 1948, Claude Shannon, an engineer at Bell Labs, published an article 
describing a communication system model applicable to networks of all 
types. His diagram illustrates the essence of a network, so it is a good place 
to begin this unit. Shannon’s model (Figure 3-1) is easy to understand.
	How are computer networks classified? Networks can be classi-
fied according to their size and geographic scope (Figure 3-2). 
PAN (personal area network) 
PANs connect smart devices or con-
sumer electronics within a range of 
about 30 feet (10 meters) and with-
out the use of wires or cables. The 
reference to personal indicates that 
the network serves a single indi-
vidual, rather than multiple users. A 
PAN could be used to sync data from 
a handheld device to a desktop com-
puter, ship data wirelessly to a printer, 
or transmit data from a smartphone 
to a wireless headset. 
LAN (local area network) 
LANs are data communication 
networks that connect personal 
computers within a very limited 
geographical area—usually a single 
building. School computer labs and 
home networks are examples of 
LANs. Wi-Fi networks that you can 
access in airports, coffee shops, and 
other public places are LANs. The in-
house networks operated by most 
businesses are also LANs.
WAN (wide area network) 
WANs cover a large geographi-
cal area and usually consist of 
several smaller networks, which 
might use different computer 
platforms and network technolo-
gies. The Internet is the world’s 
largest WAN. Other public WANs 
include telephone systems, cable 
television systems, and satellite-
based communication systems.

SECTION A, Unit 3
	Why is geographic scope important? Localized networks nor-
mally include a small number of computers, which can be connected using 
basic equipment. As the area of network coverage expands, the number of 
devices grows, specialized devices are sometimes required to boost sig-
nals, and the diversity of devices requires sophisticated management tools 
and strategies. 
	What about the Internet of Things? The Internet of Things (IoT)
is an evolving concept that may be difficult to classify as a PAN, LAN, or 
WAN. The IoT has the potential to become a global collection of smart 
devices transmitting to other devices over the Internet. Today, smart devices 
are more often grouped into small local pods that report to a centralized 
device, which in turn exchanges data with local networks and the Internet. 
Communication channels 
Do you suppose it is easier for a snooper to surreptitiously access your com-
puter when your device is connected to a Wi-Fi hotspot or cabled to a LAN? 
Some connections are more secure and more dependable than others, so it 
pays to understand the ins and outs of communication channels.
	What is a communication channel? A communication chan-
nel is the medium used to transport information from one network device 
to another. Data transmitted over a communication channel usually takes 
the form of an electromagnetic signal—waves of light, electricity, or sound. 
These waves can travel through the air or through cables, so channels are 
divided into two general classifications: wired and wireless. Wired channels 
transport data through wires and cables. Wireless channels transport data 
from one device to another without the use of cables or wires. 
	What are the options for wired channels? Wired channels 
include twisted pair wires used for telephone land lines, coaxial cables used 
for cable television networks, Category 6 cables used for LANs, and fiber-
optic cables used for high-capacity trunk lines that provide main routes for 
telephone, cable, and Internet communications (Figure 3-3).

	What are the advantages of wired channels? Before wireless 
technologies became available, local area networks were exclusively wired. 
Today, wired connections are used less frequently for home, school, and 
business networks. They remain the network technology of choice, how-
ever, for segments of the Internet and local area networks that require fast 
and secure connectivity. 
When you set up a wired connection, you don’t have to worry about hackers 
intercepting your data from the sidewalk outside your house, or your neigh-
bor stumbling across personal files when your wireless signal reaches past 
your property line. Yes, there are ways to tap into a wired network, but they 
require physical access to the cable or fairly sophisticated snooping equip-
ment. The advantages of wired channels are summarized in Figure 3-4.
	What are the disadvantages of wired connections? The 
cables that offer speed and security for a wired connection are also the main 
weakness of this type of connection. The disadvantages of wired channels 
include cost, lack of mobility, and installation hassles. Figure 3-5 provides 
more details.
Cables can be shielded 
against interference and 
encased in protective 
casings for installations 
that are outdoors and 
underground.
Wired connections 
are dependable. Their 
carrying capacity and 
speed are not affected 
by airborne interference 
from rain, snow, or elec-
trical devices. 
Wired connections are 
more secure than their 
wireless counterparts 
because a device can 
join a wired network 
only if it is physically 
connected by a cable. 
Figure 3-4: Advantages of wired channels
In WANs, wired instal-
lation can be costly 
because cables have 
to be suspended from 
poles or buried under-
ground. They can be 
damaged by weather 
events and digging in 
the wrong place. Repairs 
to underground cables 
require heavy equip-
ment to locate, access, 
and fix the break. 
LAN devices connected 
by cables have limited 
mobility. Desktop com-
puters tend to be better 
candidates for wired 
connections, whereas 
laptops, tablets, and 
handheld devices can 
retain their mobility 
when they are not teth-
ered to a cable. 
Cables are unsightly, 
tend to get tangled, and 
collect dust. Running 
cables through ceilings, 
walls, and floors can 
be challenging. Cables 
can also carry electri-
cal surges that have the 
potential to damage 
network equipment.

SECTION A, Unit 3
	What are the options for wireless channels? The most wide-
spread wireless channels for communication networks are radio signals and 
microwaves.
	How do radio signals transport data? Most wireless channels 
transport data as RF signals commonly called radio waves. RF channels 
are typically used for Bluetooth connections, Wi-Fi networks, and wide 
area wireless installations such as WiMAX. It is also the technology used 
to carry voice and data between a smartphone and a cell tower. RF signals 
are sent and received by a transceiver (a combination of a transmitter 
and a receiver) that is equipped with an antenna (Figure 3-6). 
Terminology
RF stands for radio frequency.
Terminology
Although we use the term 
wireless connection, there is no 
physical connection between 
wireless devices in a network. 
Their connection is conceptual 
in the sense that data can 
travel between “connected” 
devices.
Devices used with wireless connections are equipped with transceivers that 
include a transmitter for sending data and a receiver for collecting data. A 
transceiver has an antenna, which may be visible or may be housed out of sight 
within a device’s system unit. 
	How do microwaves transport data? Microwaves (the waves 
themselves, not your oven!) provide another option for transporting data 
wirelessly. Like radio waves, microwaves are electromagnetic signals, but 
they behave differently. Microwaves can be aimed in a single direction and 
have more ­carrying capacity than radio waves. However, microwaves can-
not penetrate metal objects and work best for line-of-sight transmission 
when a clear path exists between the transmitter and receiver. 
Microwave installations usually provide data transport for large corporate 
networks. They are also used to transmit signals between towers in cellular 
and wide-area wireless installations.
	What are the advantages and disadvantages of wireless? The 
main advantage of wireless connections is mobility. Wireless devices are 
not tethered to network cables, so battery-operated laptops, tablets, and 
smartphones can be easily moved from room to room, or even outdoors. 
With wireless networks, there are no unsightly cables, and power spikes are 
much less likely to run through cables to damage equipment. The main dis-
advantages of wireless channels are speed, range, security, and licensing. 
	Why is wireless slower than wired? Wireless signals are sus-
ceptible to interference from devices such as microwave ovens, cordless 
telephones, and baby monitors. When interference affects a wireless signal, 
data must be re-transmitted, and that takes extra time. 
	What limits the range of a wireless connection? The range of a 
wireless signal can be limited by the type of signal, the transmitter strength, 
and the physical environment. Just as radio stations fade as you move away 
from their broadcasting towers, data signals fade as the distance between 
network devices increases. Signal range can also be limited by thick walls, 
floors, or ceilings.

You have a choice of network 
connections. Which one of the 
following is broadband?
a.	 A 56 Kbps phone link
b.	 A 2.4 GHz cordless phone
c.	 A 10 Mbps cable connection
d.	 A 1.2 Mbps satellite link
Terminology
Hz is an abbreviation for hertz, 
which refers to the number 
of times a wave oscillates, or 
peaks, per second. Telephone 
signals are transmitted in the 
1,200 Hz range. Many wireless 
networks transmit a 2.4 GHz 
signal that peaks 2.4 billion 
times per second.
As signal strength decreases, so can speed. A weak signal usually means 
slow data transfers. You can get a rough idea of signal strength for your 
desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone by checking the network signal 
strength meter (Figure 3-7). 
Your digital devices may connect 
to various networks with 
differing signal strengths. Check 
the wireless signal strengths for 
any devices you have handy. 
Try It!
	What’s the problem with wireless security? Wireless signals 
float through the air and penetrate walls. The signals that carry your wire-
less data can be accessed from outside your premises. Someone outside 
of your house, for example, could surreptitiously join your network, access 
files, and piggyback on your Internet connection. To make wireless data 
useless to intruders, it should be encrypted. Later in this unit, you’ll learn 
how to use encryption to secure data sent over wireless connections.
	How does licensing affect wireless connections? Government 
agencies, such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 
regulate signals that are sent through the air. To broadcast at most fre-
quencies, including those used by radio and television stations, a license 
is required.
Wireless connections use unlicensed frequencies that are available for 
public use. These frequencies include 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Of the two, 
5 GHz is subject to less interference from other devices, but it has a more 
limited range. 
	What’s bandwidth? Network channels must move data and move 
it quickly. Bandwidth is the transmission capacity of a communication 
channel. Just as a four-lane freeway can carry more traffic than a two-
lane street, a high-bandwidth communication channel can carry more 
data than a low-bandwidth channel. For example, the coaxial cable that 
brings you more than 100 channels of cable TV has a higher bandwidth 
than your home telephone line. 
The bandwidth of a channel that carries digital data is usually measured 
in bits per second (bps). For example, your wireless LAN might be rated 
for an average speed of 27 Mbps. The bandwidth of a channel carrying 
analog data is typically measured in hertz (Hz). For instance, the cop-
per wires that carry voice-grade telephone signals are often described as 
having a bandwidth of 3,000 Hz.
Network channels that are capable of moving at least two megabits of 
data per second (2 Mbps) are classified as broadband. Channels slower 
than 2 Mbps are classified as narrowband. Broadband capacity is essen-
tial for networks that support many users, and those that carry lots of audio 
and video data, such as music and movie downloads.

Network Topology
A spider weaves a web by making silky connections between leaves, 
branches, and other surfaces. Most spider webs have a structure, and the 
same can be said for communication networks. The topologies of the net-
works you use have an effect on their dependability, security, and scope.
	What is network topology? In the context of communication net-
works, topology refers to the structure and layout of network components, 
such as computers, connecting cables, and wireless signal paths. When 
you envision how devices are connected by communication channels, you 
are creating a picture of the network’s topology. 
Unit 2 explained how peripheral devices can connect to a host device using 
expansion ports, USB cables, or Bluetooth. These connections are an 
example of point-to-point topology. When connecting several devices, two 
network topologies are popular. Star topology connects multiple devices to 
a central device. Mesh topology connects multiple devices to each other, 
either as a full mesh or a partial mesh. The less popular bus topology con-
nects devices in a linear sequence. Figure 3-8 illustrates these network 
topologies. 
	Can a network use more than one topology? Data can flow over 
multiple networks that have different topologies. As shown in Figure 3-9, 
data from a fitness wristband connects to a laptop via a point-to-point con-
nection (A). The laptop is part of a home network configured as a star (B). 
The home network uses Comcast, so it is part of a larger star network (C). 
Finally, the data is passed to the Internet, which has a mesh topology (D).

	Which topology is best? Every topology has strengths and weak-
nesses, so there is no best network topology. Figure 3-10 compares 
strengths and weaknesses of the two most popular network topologies 
based on dependability, security, capacity, expandability, control, and 
monitoring.
Dependability
If the central point fails, data 
cannot flow anywhere on the 
network. If one of the devices 
fails, however, the rest of the net-
work remains operational.
There is no central point of failure; 
redundant paths between devices 
can be used to bypass failed devices. 
 
  Security
Data that travels on a star 
pathway makes only one stop 
between the sender and desti-
nation. The threat area for any 
transmission encompasses only 
three devices and two channels.  
Within a mesh, data travels through 
several devices and over multiple 
channels. Each leg presents a poten-
tial security risk. The chance of a 
security breach rises as the number 
of devices and channels increases.
  Capacity
Star topologies are limited by 
the amount of data that can be 
handled by the central device.  
Mesh topologies offer higher capaci-
ties because data can be transmitted 
from different devices simultane-
ously.
Expandability
Expandability is limited by the 
number of devices that can be 
attached to the central device 
within its immediate area of 
wireless coverage or maximum 
cable length.
The network can be expanded infi-
nitely. As new devices are added, 
the network continues to repeat 
the signal as necessary until it 
reaches the farthest devices. 
  Control
Setup and updates are primar-
ily done on the central device, 
which also can be used to 
shut down the entire network. 
Setup is more complex, as each 
device must be configured to send, 
receive, and forward network data. 
There is no central point at which the 
network can be shut down.
Monitoring
All data passes through a central 
point, which is easy to monitor 
for legitimate or illicit purposes.
Data does not pass through a central 
point, making data more challenging 
to monitor.

Network Nodes
Communication networks connect all kinds of devices: from smartphones 
to satellite dishes, from computers to cell towers, and even between tiny 
sensors and RFID tags. Any device in a network is called a node. You are 
familiar with network nodes such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, desk-
tops, and peripheral devices. There are many other nodes that you don’t 
interact with directly, yet they ultimately control how smoothly your Netflix 
movie streams and whether your email arrives at its destination.
	What should I know about network nodes? Devices on a 
network are classified as DTEs or DCEs. DTE stands for data terminal 
equipment. A DTE can be any device that stores or generates data. When 
connected to a network, your laptop is a DTE as are your smartphone, tab-
let, and fitness tracker. The servers that house Web sites, handle email, 
offer cloud storage, and stream videos are also DTEs. Your own DTEs are 
under your control, and many servers are open to public access.
DCE stands for data communication equipment. These devices control the 
speed of data over networks, convert signals as they jump from cables to 
wireless, check for corrupted data, and route data from its origin to its desti-
nation. The most well known DCEs are routers and modems. 
	How does a router work? You probably have a DCE in your home 
network. A router is a device that controls the flow of data within a net-
work and also acts as a gateway to pass data from one network to another. 
Routers are used to direct traffic over major Internet trunk lines. And they 
are commonly used to route data from home networks to the Internet (Figure 
3-11).
	How does a modem work? A modem contains circuitry that converts 
the data-carrying signals from a digital device to signals that can travel over 
various communication channels. The kind of modem you use depends on 
whether you are connecting to a dial-up, wireless, cable, satellite, or DSL 
Internet service. A modem is usually supplied by your Internet service pro-
vider (Figure 3-12).

SECTION A, Unit 3
Communication protocols 
A protocol is a set of rules for interacting and negotiating. In some respects, 
it is like the hand signals used by pitchers and catchers during baseball 
games. Before the ball is thrown, the pitcher and catcher use hand signals 
to negotiate the speed and style of the pitch. Similar to the way pitchers 
and catchers use signals, networks use communication protocols to coor-
dinate data transfer.
	What is a communication protocol? In the context of networks, a 
communication protocol refers to a set of rules for efficiently transmitting 
data from one network node to another. Two devices on a network negoti-
ate their communication protocols through a process called handshaking. 
The transmitting device sends a signal that means “I want to communicate.” 
It then waits for an acknowledgement signal from the receiving device. The 
whooshing sounds you hear as two fax machines connect are examples of 
handshaking. 
	What can communication protocols do? Protocols set standards 
for encoding and decoding data, guiding data to its destination, and reducing 
the effects of interference. Networks use more than one protocol, and the 
collection of protocols for a network is referred to as a protocol stack. 
Some protocols set standards for the physical cables and signals used to 
connect network nodes. Other protocols deal with the way data flows over 
network channels. And even more protocols specify standard formats for 
data so that it can be accessed by communication software. Figure 3-14 
explains.

	How can a network detect if a signal has been corrupted? 
Error correction is one of the responsibilities of communication pro-
tocols. Remember from Unit 1 that text, numbers, sound, images, and 
video all are represented by bits. Suppose that some of those bits are 
garbled in transmission. Did that email say to meet at 29:00? Did your 
music track stop halfway through? Without error checking, the data you 
receive may not be reliable or complete.
Digital networks—those that transmit digital signals—can be easily mon-
itored to determine if interference has corrupted any signals. At its most 
primitive level, digital equipment is sensitive to only two frequencies—
one that represents 1s and one that represents 0s. 
Suppose that a 0 is sent as ‑5 volts and a 1 is sent as +5 volts. What if, 
during transmission, some interference changes the voltage of a 1 bit 
from +5 volts to +3 volts? 
To correct the corrupted bit, the receiving device realizes that +3 volts is 
not one of the two valid voltages. It guesses that a 1 bit (+5 volts) was 
actually transmitted and cleans the signal by reestablishing its voltage to 
+5 (Figure 3-15).

Background
The Internet has its roots in a U.S. Department of Defense project that tran-
sitioned into a nonprofit civilian operation, then to a burgeoning commercial 
enterprise. We use the Internet without a second thought to communicate, 
create, and consume content. Yet the Internet also offers profound ethical, 
security, privacy, and legal challenges. To understand these challenges and 
the controversies surrounding them, all the stakeholders need a good under-
standing of basic Internet technology.
	How did the Internet get started? The history of the Internet begins 
in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first man-made satel-
lite. In response to this display of Soviet superiority, the U.S. government 
resolved to improve its scientific and technical infrastructure. One of the 
resulting initiatives was the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
ARPA swung into action with a project designed to help scientists commu-
nicate and share valuable computer resources. The ARPANET, created in 
1969, connected computers at UCLA, the Stanford Research Institute, the 
University of Utah, and the University of California at Santa Barbara (Figure 
3-16). 
In 1985, the National Science Foundation (NSF) used ARPANET technol-
ogy to create a larger network, linking not just a few mainframe computers, 
but entire LANs at each site. Connecting two or more networks creates an 
internetwork, or internet. The NSF network was an internet (with a lower-
case i). As this network grew throughout the world, it became known as the 
Internet (with an uppercase I).
	How did the Internet become so popular? Early Internet pio-
neers used primitive command-line user interfaces to send email, transfer 
files, and run ­scientific calculations on Internet supercomputers. Finding 
information was not easy, and access was limited to a fairly small group of 
educators and scientists.
In the early 1990s, software developers created new user-friendly Internet 
access tools, and Internet accounts became available to anyone willing to 
pay a monthly subscription fee.

	How big is the Internet today? With an estimated 500 million 
nodes and more than 2 billion users, the Internet is huge. Although exact 
figures cannot be determined, it is estimated that the Internet handles more 
than an exabyte of data every day. An exabyte is 1.074 billion gigabytes, 
and that’s a nearly unimaginable amount of data. Visualizing such a vast 
network is difficult, but images like those in Figure 3-17 help a bit.
	Who operates the Internet? Although the Internet is such a vast 
entity, in theory no single person, organization, company, or government 
runs it. At one time, the Internet was composed of many regional networks, 
established in countries throughout the world. Gradually, these networks 
have fallen under the control of large telecommunications companies, such 
as Comcast, AT&T, and NTT Communications.
The glue that holds the Internet together and makes it possible for data to 
travel across borders is a set of standard protocols that were developed for 
the original ARPANET. In this respect, Internet governance is simply a set 
of shared protocols, procedures, and technologies that evolve through com-
mon agreement among network providers. 
	Who supervises Internet standards? Although each country can 
develop laws, policies, and regulations for the networks within their jurisdic-
tion, there is one crucial administrative task necessary to keep the Internet 
from sinking into chaos. Every Internet node—each server, each computer, 
and each piece of data communication equipment—must have a unique 
address in order to send and receive data. 
The organization that supervises Internet addressing is ICANN, the Internet 
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. ICANN is headquartered in 
Los Angeles and subject to oversight by the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
In 2014, the Department of Commerce sought approval to transfer its 
authority to an international organization. The status of that effort was pend-
ing when this textbook went to press.
Control of Internet address assignments is a powerful tool. It provides the 
means to block users from accessing specific network nodes. Local govern-
ments exercise this power within their jurisdictions to shut down servers that 
violate copyright and distribute inappropriate content. The power to globally 
shut down access to a server, however, only rests with ICANN. You will 
discover more about the key role of Internet addresses later in this section.

Internet Infrastructure
The Internet is not one huge communication network, but rather a net-
work of networks. The way these networks fit together is referred to as the 
Internet infrastructure. Internet networks are organized into tiers. As a 
consumer, you are subject to the fees, policies, and technologies of the tiers 
that provide your Internet service.
	What are the components of the Internet? The Internet is 
structured as a hierarchy of networks. Tier 1 networks are at the top of the 
hierarchy, followed by Tier 2 and Tier 3 networks. Tier 1 networks, such as 
AT&T, CenturyLink, Verizon, and NTT Communications, form the Internet 
backbone, a system of high-capacity routers and fiber-optic communica-
tion links providing the main routes for data speeding across the Internet. 
Routers on the Internet backbone store routing tables that calculate and 
track the most efficient routes for data to travel from point A to point B.
The Internet backbone is configured as a mesh network that offers redun-
dant routes for data transport. The backbone’s mesh infrastructure is 
probably the basis for the myth that the Internet originated as a Department 
of Defense project to create a network that could survive nuclear attacks.
Networks that form the Internet are maintained by Internet service provid-
ers (ISPs) that supply routers and other data communication equipment, as 
well as physical and wireless channels to carry data. ISPs exchange data at 
Internet exchange points (IXPs). 
Consumers generally connect to Tier 2 or Tier 3 networks. Use the info-
graphic in Figure 3-18 to become familiar with the Internet infrastructure 
and its terminology; pay attention to the arrangement of network tiers and 
points where data moves between them.

	Who pays for the Internet? The Internet is not free. ISPs make a 
substantial investment in equipment and the cable or wireless infrastruc-
tures to connect consumers. The largest providers each have close to 
200,000 miles of cables installed across continents and laid over the ocean 
floor. 
Tier 1 ISPs also own and maintain millions of dollars of data communi-
cation equipment. In addition to infrastructure expenses, ISPs are subject 
to data transport fees, especially when shipping data up through higher 
tiers. To offset expenses, ISPs charge consumers for access. Figure 3-19 
explains how it works.
Figure 3-20: Data Packets
Tier 1 service providers exchange 
data with other Tier 1 providers on a 
no-cost basis.
Tier 2 service providers exchange 
data on a no-cost basis with other 
Tier 2 providers, but they pay fees 
to connect to the backbone through 
Tier 1 providers.
Tier 3 service providers connect to 
Tier 2 or Tier 1 providers and pay 
transit fees for the data exchanged. 
Consumers either pay fees directly 
or their access is subsidized by an 
organization or government.
Packets
Most people envision their files, email, and other data flying through the 
Internet as a continuous stream of bits. This is not the case. Files are 
chopped up into small pieces called packets. The technology that breaks a 
file into packets and routes them to any location on Earth in the blink of an 
eye is absolutely amazing.
	What’s a packet? A packet is a parcel of data that is sent across a 
computer network. Each packet contains the address of its sender, the des-
tination address, a sequence number, and some data. When packets reach 
their destination, they are reassembled into the original message according 
to the sequence numbers (Figure 3-20).

	Why not just send an entire message? Some communication 
networks, such as telephone systems, use a technology called circuit 
switching, which essentially establishes a dedicated, private link between 
one telephone and another for the duration of a call. Unfortunately, circuit 
switching is rather inefficient. For example, when someone is on hold, no 
communication is taking place—yet the circuit is reserved and cannot be 
used for other communications.
A more efficient alternative to circuit switching is packet switching tech-
nology, which divides a message into several packets that can be routed 
independently to their destination. Packets from many different messages 
can share a single communication channel, or circuit. 
Packets are shipped over the ­circuit on a first-come, first-served basis. If 
some packets from a message are not available, the system does not need 
to wait for them. Instead, the system moves on to send packets from other 
messages. The end result is a steady stream of data (Figure 3-21).
Terminology
The telephone network is 
sometimes referred to as the 
public switched telephone 
network (PSTN).

SECTION B, Unit 3
	How are packets created? One of the core Internet protocols, TCP 
(Transmission Control Protocol) is responsible for dividing files into chunks, 
adding headers containing information for reassembling packets in their 
original order, and verifying that the data was not corrupted while in transit 
(a process called error checking). When data is sent over the Internet using 
TCP, it will reliably reach its destination. TCP is built into applications that 
transmit data from one digital device to another. 
	How are packets transported? TCP is also responsible for estab-
lishing a connection, transferring packets, and closing the connection when 
the transmission is complete. Most of the data that flows over the Internet is 
under the control of TCP. 
An alternative transport protocol, UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is faster 
than TCP but does not perform error checking and cannot reorder packets 
if they are received out of order. UDP, therefore, is suitable for applications 
in which a bit of lost data is not critical, such as streaming video and music, 
and Internet-based multiplayer games and voice calls. UDP and TCP both 
use communications ports to shuttle data into and out of a network device.
	What is a communications port? Here’s the problem: On a packet-
switching network, packets for Web pages, email, streaming videos, and 
other downloads may arrive at your digital device in the same stream and 
over the same channel. The packets may not arrive in neat little bundles; 
some video packets could arrive interspersed with Web page packets. 
Which packets should go to the browser and which to the Netflix player?
A communication port (usually referred to simply as a port) is a virtual end 
point for data entering and leaving a digital device. These ports are virtual in 
the sense that they are not physical ports, as are USB ports, for example. A 
communication port is not a physical circuit, but rather an abstract concept 
of a doorway, an opening, or a portal through which data flows.
Ports work in conjunction with Internet addresses as you’ll learn in later 
units. Computers can have up to 65,535 ports. Typically about 10–20 ports 
are in use and open for various types of data. Data originating from the Web, 
for instance, uses port 80, whereas streaming video uses port 554. When 
ports are open, data is allowed to flow freely. Closing ports can block data, 
and that strategy is used by firewalls to prevent unauthorized intrusions.
Ports create simulated end-to-end connections on packet-switching net-
works. So although the devices on two ends of a communication channel 
are not connected by a single dedicated circuit, ports create a conceptual 
circuit for each type of data, as shown in Figure 3-22.

Internet Addresses
You might have heard that Internet addresses are running out. Does that 
mean some people will be unable to get online? Will people have to share 
addresses? Networks use several kinds of addresses to determine where 
packets originate and where they are headed. To find out how Internet 
addresses might affect your online access, read on.
	Exactly what is an Internet address? Although most people are 
accustomed to entering something such as www.wikipedia.org to access 
Internet locations, those “www” addresses are not the underlying address 
used to transport data to its destination. Internet addresses are controlled 
by IP (Internet Protocol), which—along with TCP—is part of the Internet 
protocol suite. IP defines two sets of addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. 
	What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6? IPv4, which 
stands for Internet Protocol version 4, is the Internet address standard 
that has been used since the early 1980s. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses 
to uniquely identify devices connected to the Internet. In binary, IPv4 
addresses are written like this:
11001111 01001011 01110101 00011010
For convenience, 32-bit binary addresses are usually written in decimal as 
four sets of three digits separated by periods, like this:
207.75.117.26
Using 32 bits, IPv4 offers about 4 billion unique addresses. In 2011, that 
supply of addresses was completely allocated. Yes, IP addresses can be 
recycled when the original assignees no longer want them, but the demand 
far outstrips the number of addresses coming up for recycling. Another set of 
addresses was needed.
IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) uses 128 bits for each address, producing 
billions and billions of unique Internet addresses. An IPv6 address is usually 
written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, like this:
2001:48a8:800:1192:198:110:192:54 
Don’t worry, there are enough IPv6 addresses for the foreseeable future, 
even with the anticipated influx of 2 billion new Internet users and the 
Internet of Things poised to add an estimated 50–100 billion devices to the 
Internet by 2020.
	Does every Internet user need an IP address? It is more accurate 
to say that every device on the Internet needs an IP address. Many, but not 
all, devices on the Internet have permanently assigned IP addresses, called 
static addresses. As a general rule, routers and computers on the Internet 
that act as servers use static IP addresses. 
ISPs, Web sites, Web hosting services, and email servers that always need 
to be found at the same address also require static IP addresses. There 
is an emerging trend for individuals to request static IP addresses for their 
home networks, and a static address might be useful for remotely communi-
cating with sensors and other devices in the Internet of Things.
Terminology
Internet Protocol is often 
referred to as TCP/IP 
(pronounced “T-C-P-I-P”).

84a3 would be __________.
a.	 an IPv4 address

SECTION B, Unit 3
	What happens when a device doesn’t have a static IP 
address? IP addresses can be temporarily allocated so that a device uses 
an address only while it is actively online. When the device is turned off or 
its Internet connection is disabled, the address can be recycled to another 
device. The next time the device is turned on, it will be assigned a differ-
ent IP address. Internet addresses that are temporarily assigned are called 
dynamic addresses. 
In practice, dynamic IP addresses do not change very often. Today, most 
consumers have always-on Internet connections that remain active as long 
as the router that connects to the Internet remains powered on. Turning 
a computer off or on does not affect the IP address stored in the router. 
Customers who access the Internet using Comcast XFINITY and AT&T 
U-verse, for example, could have the same IP address for weeks or months. 
 	How do devices get IP addresses? IP addresses can be assigned 
by a network administrator, but more commonly they are automatically 
assigned by DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). Most devices 
are preconfigured to receive an IP address by sending a query to the net-
work device acting as the DHCP server. That device could be a router for 
a local area network or a DHCP server from your ISP. IP addresses get a 
bit tricky because a device can have a public IP address and a private IP 
address. 
	What is a private IP address? Let’s suppose that your laptop is con-
nected to your school network. The DHCP server for the school assigns a 
dynamic IP address to your laptop when you log in. That address, which 
probably begins with 10, 172, 192, FD, or Fc00, is classified as a private IP 
address because it works only within the school network. 
A private IP address can be allocated by any network without supervision 
from ICANN. However, the address cannot be used to send data over the 
Internet; it is not routable. Figure 3-23 demonstrates how to find your private 
IP address.
1. Access Network

	If my private IP address can’t be routed over the Internet, 
how does my data get anywhere? Here is where your local router 
plays a crucial role. Any network you use to access the Internet—a campus 
network, your home network, or a Wi-Fi hotspot—has a router that con-
nects to the Internet. The router has a public IP address that is routable 
over the Internet. Figure 3-24 explains how public and private IP addresses 
work.
What is your public IP address? 
You can find it by googling 
What’s my IP. Compare your 
public IP address to your private 
address.

Figure 3-24: ROUTING DATA USING PRIVATE AND PUBLIC IP ADDRESSES
 You request a stream-
ing music track from an 
online music store.
 The request, 
with your private 
IP address, goes to 
your local router.
 The router records 
your IP address as the 
source of the request. 
 Your request is forwarded 
to the music store using the 
router’s public IP address.
 The music store 
sends the stream to 
your router.
 The router looks in its records and 
finds that your private IP address sent the 
request to the music store, so the music 
stream is forwarded to your computer.
	Does using a private IP address make me anonymous? No, 
the router’s network address translation table keeps track of your activities, 
so your footprint across the Internet can be traced back to you. However, 
a private IP address can protect you from some threats. For example, a 
hacker who randomly enters IP addresses looking for unauthorized access 
will never find your private IP address because the only address that is vis-
ible to the public is the address of your local router. This security technique 
is usually referred to as NAT (network address translation).
That being said, private IP addresses cannot protect your devices from 
many other attacks. Clicking corrupted links or downloading infected files 
sends packets and also makes a path in the network address translation 
table that can allow malware into your device.

Domain Names
If the Internet has an Achilles’ heel, it is the domain name system. When a 
wide swath of the Internet goes dark, when you hear about massive outages, 
or when you struggle to get to a Web site that seems to have disappeared, 
the domain name system is probably at fault. The ability of governments to 
censor information by blocking sites is also made possible by the domain 
name system. And if there is an Internet kill switch, you can bet that the 
domain name system will be involved.
	What is the domain name system? People find it difficult to 
remember the string of numbers in an IP address. Therefore, most Internet 
destinations also have an easy-to-remember domain name, such as 
nike.com. A domain name is a key component of Web page addresses and 
email addresses. You can easily recognize the domain name in a Web site 
address such as www.nike.com or an email address such as ceo@nike.
com. The mechanism for tracking domain names and their corresponding 
IP addresses is called the domain name system (DNS).
	Do I need a domain name? For client-style Internet activities, such as 
Web browsing, email, and downloading, you do not need your own domain 
name. Today, social networking sites give ample opportunity for making your 
presence known on the Internet. 
However, domain names are quite useful for businesses and individual art-
ists, musician, or crafters who want to engage in online commerce. The fees 
associated with obtaining a domain name might initially seem small. The first 
year may cost only $1, but prices for subsequent years are typically around 
$15. Then there is the question of how many domain names you need; one 
might not be enough. You might need domain names with more than one 
extension, such as .com or .club. 
ICANN is the top-level authority for supervising domain name requests. 
Rather than going directly to ICANN, domain names can be obtained from 
several domain registrars and hosting services that provide Internet-based 
server space for Web sites (Figure 3-25).

	What is a top-level domain? A domain name ends with an exten-
sion that indicates its top-level domain. For example, in the domain name 
msu.edu, .edu indicates that the computer is maintained by an educa-
tional institution. Country codes also serve as top-level domains. Canada’s 
top-level domain is .ca; the United Kingdom’s is .uk; Australia’s is .au; and 
the European Union uses .eu as a top-level domain. 
Historically, businesses used the .com domain, while nonprofit organiza-
tions used .org. Educational institutions used .edu. The .net domain was 
usually used by communication companies. 
Businesses generally obtained domain names with all applicable top-level 
domains (e.g., nike.com, nike.org, and nike.net), to prevent their use by 
competitors or fake businesses. Businesses also tried to acquire domain 
names with similar sounding names or those that are common misspellings 
of their corporate names. 
Today, there are hundreds of additional top-level domains, such as .biz, 
.co, and .fit. Obtaining all the TLDs for a business name is not practical. 
Even within a sector such as education, .edu has been joined by .academy, 
.education, .guru, .institute, .training, and .university. 
	How does the domain name system work? Scattered around the 
world are several domain name servers that maintain lists of all domain 
names and their corresponding IP addresses. In addition, frequently used 
domain names are stored by ISPs, educational institutions, organizations, 
and Internet companies such as Google. 
When new domain names are added, these lists are updated. New domain 
names may take several days to propagate to all of the lists, which is why 
new Web sites can be accessed only by their IP addresses for the first few 
days they are in operation. A Web site can be accessed by its domain name

Suppose you want to look at the newest selection of Nike athletic shoes. 
You enter nike.com in your browser’s address bar. Your browser must find 
the IP address that corresponds to nike.com before it can connect you to 
the site. Your browser queries a domain name server to get the IP address, 
a process that generally happens without noticeable delay (Figure 3-26).

	So what makes the DNS one of the Internet’s weaknesses? 
Altering the DNS records can change the destination of email, browser con-
nections, and download requests. Unauthorized changes to the DNS are 
called DNS spoofing. 
Hackers use DNS spoofing so that queries for legitimate sites are directed to 
fake sites. Some governments use DNS spoofing to redirect searches from 
culturally or politically inappropriate sites to government-approved sites. 
Figure 3-27 illustrates what happens when unauthorized changes are made 
in the DNS. 
Figure 3-27: DNS Spoofing
For security, you should 
periodically check your DNS 
to make sure it hasn’t been 
changed by a hacker. What is 
the IP address of your DNS? Is 
it a private address residing on 
your router or a public address? 
Try It!
	Can domain name servers be turned off? Yes, though more com-
monly a DNS server operated by your ISP will go offline as a result of an 
equipment failure. When the DNS you’re using goes down, the process of 
accessing the Internet can get very slow while DNS requests are routed 
through alternate servers. It is even possible that a DNS outage can leave 
you without Internet access unless you enter raw IP addresses.
It is a good idea to know how to find your DNS server and how to change it in 
case of an outage. Figure 3-28 demonstrates how to find your DNS settings.

	What can I use as an alternative DNS server? Surprisingly, you 
might be able to bypass DNS outages, blocks, and hacks by changing your 
DNS server. Errors in the domain name tables may be limited to the domain 
name server that you are using. Connecting to a different domain name 
server might restore full access. In addition, when you are traveling—espe-
cially overseas—a local DNS server might be closer and quicker.
Keep the numbers in Figure 3-29 handy in case you need to change your 
domain name server. Write them down, or store them locally on your device. 
Remember, if your domain name server has an outage, you won’t be able 
to use domain names to search the Internet for a solution.

Connection Basics
With online access becoming an essential component in our daily 
lives, sociologists have been tracking Internet “haves” and “have-nots.” 
According to Statista, an estimated 80% of American households have 
Internet access. Worldwide, about 40% of the population has Internet 
access. Not all of these connections are fast and dependable. Let’s take a 
look at what makes a good Internet connection.
	How fast is the Internet? Data travels over the Internet at an incred-
ible speed, but that speed varies. Some Internet services are faster than 
others. Speed is affected by the amount of traffic flowing over the connec-
tion. It slows down when usage is heavy. Slowdowns also occur as a result 
of faulty routers and when hackers launch denial-of-service attacks that 
overwhelm server capacity. 
It is easy to check the speed of your Internet connection by running a few 
online tests. Figure 3-30 shows results from testing speed in a rural area. 
Is this connection suitable for streaming movies, playing online games, and 
conducting video chats?
	What does connection speed measure? Speed is the distance 
something travels in a specified amount of time. The speed of a car, for 
example, is measured in miles (distance) per hour (time). What we casually 
refer to as “connection speed” has little to do with distance. The most com-
mon measurement of connection speed is the amount of data that can be 
transmitted in a specified time. Technically, it is a measure of capacity. But 
let’s use non-technical terms and call it speed.
The speed test in Figure 3-30 produced a download speed of 2.00 Mbps 
because it was able to move two megabits of data down from a server to 
the user’s computer in one second. The upload speed at which data is 
transferred from the computer to a server was only 0.66 Mbps. With this 
connection, downloading a two-hour movie from iTunes would take about 
an hour. Uploading a 4 MB photo would take about eight seconds. 
What is the speed of your 
Internet connection right now?

b.	 Yes, the download speed 
qualifies as broadband.

0.66 Mbps is not fast enough.
d.	 No, its average speed is only 
0.28 Mbps.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

	How much speed do I need? For email, browsing the Web, and 
streaming videos, 0.5 Mbps (500 Kbps) speeds are adequate. However, 
other activities require higher speeds, as shown in Figure 3-31.
	Why are upload and download speeds different? ISPs control 
connection speeds based on the service plan you’ve selected. Your band-
width cap is the top speed allowed by your plan. During peak times, ISPs 
can place further limits on speed, a process called bandwidth throttling.
When Internet upload speed differs from download speed, you have an 
asymmetric connection. When upload and download speeds are the 
same, you have a symmetric connection. 
Most Internet connections are asymmetrical with upload speeds consid-
erably less than download speeds. Asymmetric connections discourage 
subscribers from setting up Web and email servers that would transmit 
lots of outgoing data. For most users, however, an asymmetric connection 
is sufficient, but download speeds of less than 1.5 Mbps may not provide 
the full Internet experience. 
	What is ping? Ping is utility software designed to measure respon-
siveness. Ping rate indicates how quickly data can reach a server and 
bounce back to you. Ping was named after the sound that a submarine’s 
sonar makes when it bounces off an undersea object. 
Technically, Ping measures latency. Latency is the elapsed time for data 
to make a round-trip from point A to point B and back to point A. Latency is 
measured in milliseconds (ms). A millisecond is a thousandth of a second, 
so data transmitted on an Internet connection with 100 ms latency makes a 
round trip in one-tenth of a second.

	What is an acceptable ping rate? Latency generally averages 
less than 40 ms (milliseconds) within North America, but increases to about 
75 ms for transatlantic transmissions. If you want to play online multiplayer 
games, it is best to have less than 100 ms latency. Good-quality video 
streaming and videoconferencing require latency rates of 200 ms or less. 
Speed and latency are not the only factors that affect your Internet experi-
ence. Even if your connection gets good marks on speed tests, jitter and 
packet loss can degrade the quality of online services. 
	What are jitter and packet loss? Jitter measures the variability 
of packet latency. Network traffic and interference can delay some packets 
and create erratic data flow. If the variation between packets exceeds 5 ms, 
Internet voice and video call quality is likely to be poor. 
Packet loss refers to data that never reaches its destination or gets dis-
carded because it arrives too late to be of any use. Packet loss of less than 
2% is required for acceptable streaming, gaming, Skype, and voice calls. 
Too many lost packets during an online gaming session can cause the 
game to stutter or stall. And if packets don’t arrive in the correct order, your 
game character might seem to act randomly for a few seconds. You can test 
the jitter and packet loss on your Internet connection (Figure 3-32).

	Can I troubleshoot an Internet connection? Suppose your 
Internet connection seems unusually slow one day. Or, perhaps you cannot 
access a Web site that you frequently use. You wonder, “Is the problem on 
my computer, my ISP, or somewhere else on the Internet?” To find out, you 
can use Traceroute, a network diagnostic tool that lists each router and 
server that your data encounters as it travels over the Internet. 
Traceroute sends three packets of data to a specified destination. It records 
the address of each router along the way and the elapsed time for each 
“hop.” When a connection is inoperable, the packets will not reach their 
destination and they will become lost. Figure 3-33 illustrates how to use 
Traceroute and how to interpret its results.
Travel times for this connection 
are extremely slow. Results from 
your test should be much faster.
The trace timed 
out before the 
packets arrived at 
their destination. 
All in all, this is a 
bad connection.
A list of routers indicates 
the path of the packet as it 
traveled over the Internet.
On a Mac, open the Utilities folder, then select Terminal. Enter the 
command traceroute followed by any domain name, like this:
On a PC, from the Home screen, type com and choose the option 
for Command Prompt. Enter the command tracert followed by any 
domain name, like this:

	What else affects the speed of my connection? Your Internet 
connection can be affected by outages and traffic. In Section B, you found 
out what can happen when a DNS server goes down. Service disrup-
tions can also occur at ISPs, cloud storage sites, email servers, and other 
Internet-based services. You can use online tools such as Akamai’s Real-
time Web Monitor and downrightnow.com to check the status of various 
Internet services. 
	What are my Internet connection options? Although public 
Internet access is available in many locations, such as coffee shops and 
libraries, most consumers like the convenience of having their own Internet 
connection. Depending on your geographical location, you may have sev-
eral options for connecting to the Internet. Before we look at the most 
popular Internet access options such as cable Internet service, DSL, and 
cellular broadband, consider the pros and cons of the three classifications 
of Internet connections in Figure 3-34.
Figure 3-34: Internet connection Options
Fixed Internet Access
Fixed Internet access links your computer to an ISP from 
a stationary point, such as a wall socket or roof-mounted 
antenna. This service is dependable and relatively cost 
effective. You can’t take it with you, so when you’re away 
from home, you must depend on public access points.
Mobile Internet Access
Mobile Internet access allows you to use the Internet 
while you are on the go, such as using a cell phone to col-
lect your email while you are traveling by train. Data plans 
for these services can be costly.
Portable Internet Access
Portable Internet access allows you to easily move your 
access device, as in the case of vehicle-mounted satellite 
dishes that can be deployed when the vehicle is parked. This 
service is primarily used in situations where mobile and fixed 
access are not available.

Cable Internet Service
The gold standard of fixed Internet access is cable Internet service, which 
is offered by the same companies that supply cable television. Cable ser-
vice is a luxury enjoyed by developed countries; emerging nations cannot 
afford its expensive infrastructure, nor can device owners afford the high 
cost of monthly subscriptions. 
	How does cable Internet service work? The cable television sys-
tem was originally designed for remote areas where TV broadcast ­signals 
could not be received with a roof-mounted antenna. These systems were 
called community antenna television, or CATV. The CATV concept was to 
install one or more large, expensive satellite dishes in a community, catch 
TV signals with these dishes, and then send the ­signals over a system of 
cables to individual homes.
With cables branching out from a central location, the topology of a CATV 
system happened to also work as the infrastructure for a digital data net-
work. Now, in addition to carrying signals for cable television, the CATV 
infrastructure also carries Internet data. When your cable TV company 
becomes your Internet provider, your computer becomes part of a neighbor-
hood network joined by the cable company’s wiring (Figure 3-35).
	How does the system transport data? The cable modem supplied 
with your subscription converts signals from your computer to signals that 
can travel over the cable infrastructure. CATV coaxial and fiber-optic cables 
have plenty of bandwidth to carry television signals for hundreds of chan-
nels in addition to digital data. CATV cables provide bandwidth for television 
signals, incoming data signals, and outgoing data signals (Figure 3-36). 
	How fast is cable Internet service? Most cable Internet service 
is asymmetric, with upload speeds considerably slower than download 
speeds to discourage subscribers from setting up public Web servers. 
Service plans range from economy packages offering speeds of 3 Mbps to 
an expensive 150 Mbps package. Your actual speed may be less than the 
advertised speed due to traffic from other subscribers in your neighborhood.

Telephone Network Internet Service
Some people limp along with narrowband access to the Internet, which is 
frustratingly slow. Telephone companies offer four types of service: dial-
up, ISDN, DSL, and FTTH. Only two of these technologies are considered 
broadband. Are the other two of any use at all? 
	What is a dial-up connection? A dial-up connection is a fixed 
Internet connection that uses a voiceband modem and the telephone com-
pany’s circuit-switched network to transport data between your ­computer 
and your ISP. A voiceband modem converts digital signals from a com-
puter into audible analog signals that can travel over telephone lines. A 
modem transmits a 1,070 Hz tone for a 0 data bit and a 1,270 Hz tone for a 
1 data bit (Figure 3-37).
	How does a dial-up connection work? When you use a dial-up 
connection, a voiceband modem places a ­regular telephone call to your ISP. 
When the ISP’s computer answers your call, a ­dedicated circuit is estab-
lished between you and your ISP—just as though you had made a voice call 
and someone at the ISP had picked up the phone. 
The circuit remains ­connected for the duration of the call to carry data 
between your computer and the ISP.  As your data arrives at the ISP, a 
router sends it out over the Internet (Figure 3-38).
	How fast is dial-up service? ISPs, such as NetZero, AOL, and 
EarthLink, still offer dial-up Internet access. The service ordinarily costs less 
than $10 per month, but the access speed is slow. 
The maximum speed of a dial-up connection is 56 Kbps, so it is not classi-
fied as broadband. Actual data transfer speeds are affected by factors such 
as the quality of your phone line and connection. In practice, the top speed 
for downloads is about 44 Kbps. For uploads, the data rate drops to 33 
Kbps or less.
Dial-up service is the Internet connection of last resort for people who live in 
remote areas where land lines are the only communication services.

SECTION C, Unit 3
	How about ISDN? ISDN stands for Integrated Services Digital 
Network. It essentially divides a telephone line into two channels: one for 
data and one for voice. The data channel uses packet switching and sends 
data in digital format, unlike dial-up, which uses analog tones to carry data. 
With data rates of 128 Kbps, ISDN was only briefly popular in the United 
States, though in Europe it still has an active base of users.
	What is DSL? DSL (digital subscriber line) is a high-speed, digital, 
always-on, Internet access technology that runs over standard phone lines. 
It is best known as the technology offered by AT&T’s U-verse service. 
Several variations of DSL technology exist. ADSL (asymmetric DSL) offers 
faster speeds for downloads than for uploads, and it is the most common. 
SDSL (symmetric DSL) offers the same speed for uploads as for down-
loads. Other flavors of DSL include HDSL (high bit rate DSL) and VDSL 
(very high bit rate DSL). 
	How does DSL work? A DSL modem converts computer signals 
into high-frequency data signals. Voice and data signals travel over tele-
phone lines to your telephone company’s local switching station. There, 
voice signals are routed to the regular telephone system and data signals 
are routed to the Internet (Figure 3-39).
	How fast is DSL? The speed of a DSL connection varies according 
to the characteristics of your telephone line and your distance from the tele-
phone company’s switching station. The least expensive plans offer speeds 
of 768 Kbps. Premium plans offer 6 Mbps service. DSL installations require 
filters on every phone to screen out frequencies that interfere with data sig-
nals (Figure 3-40).

	What is FTTH? FTTH stands for fiber-to-the-home. It is the use of 
high-capacity fiber-optic cables, rather than coaxial cables or twisted pair 
wires, to connect homes to broader municipal networks. As telephone com-
panies upgrade their infrastructure with fiber-optic cables, they are able to 
offer faster access speeds. AT&T, for example, offers an Internet access 
plan with 45 Mbps speeds. That plan is available only in areas where fiber 
runs to homes.

Satellite Internet Service
Communications satellites seem so retro. They settled into orbit during an 
era when your grandparents watched The Jetsons and the United States 
rushed to catch up to the Soviet Union’s manned spaceflight program. 
And yet at one point in time, satellites used for continent-to-continent 
telephone communications appeared to be a natural fit with the emerging 
Internet. Unfortunately, satellites have a fatal flaw that reduces their suit-
ability for today’s Internet. What’s the problem? Read on to find out.
	What is satellite Internet service? Most people are familiar with 
services that provide access to television programming over a personal 
satellite dish. Many companies that provide satellite TV also offer Internet 
access. Satellite Internet service is a means of distributing broadband 
asymmetric Internet access by broadcasting signals to a satellite. In many 
rural areas, satellite Internet service is the only alternative to a slow dial-up 
connection.
	How does satellite Internet service work? Figure 3-41 illustrates 
how data from a customer’s computer (1) is converted into signals by the 
customer’s modem (2) that are carried by cable to a personal satellite dish 
(3), and broadcast to a communication satellite (4). Signals are rebroad-
cast from the satellite to a ground-based ISP (5) that forwards them to the 
Internet (6). 
	How fast is satellite Internet service? Satellite service averages 
1.0 to 1.5 Mbps for downloads but only 100 to 256 Kbps for uploads. Satellite 
signals can be slowed or blocked by adverse weather conditions, such as 
rain and snow, which makes this type of data transport less reliable than 
wired Internet access services, such as cable and DSL.
Satellite data transport is subject to latency delays of one second or more, 
which occur as your data is routed between your computer and a satel-
lite. Medium Earth Orbit satellites positioned about 5,000 miles (8,000 km) 
above Earth have a latency of 132 ms. The latency for geosynchronous 
satellites 22,000 miles (35,786 km) above Earth is about 500 ms. 
Geosynchronous latency might not pose much of a problem for general 
Web surfing and downloading files, but it can become a showstopper for 
interactive gaming that requires a quick response, and for video calling with 
Skype, FaceTime, and similar services.

Mobile Broadband Service
Worldwide, more people access the Internet using cellular data plans than 
with fixed connections. Many of these subscribers can afford only one 
device. They make do with the nuisance of a small screen in exchange 
for the convenience offered by a pocket-sized device with voice and data 
capability. Mobile broadband service has become so compelling that 
most of the Web has undergone a visual makeover to fit the requirements 
of smartphone-sized screens.
	How does mobile broadband work? Cell networks transmit voice 
and data using radio signals. The signals flow between a device, such as a 
mobile phone, and a cellular radio tower (1), as shown in Figure 3-42. The 
transmitters and receivers on each tower cover a specific area and use a 
unique frequency. Data signals are passed to ground stations (2), where 
they are forwarded over a packet-switched network to the Internet (3); voice 
signals may be routed to a circuit-switched network (4).
	What happens when I move between towers? When you are 
accessing the Internet and move out of range of one tower, the cellular net-
work automatically searches for a new channel so that it can hand off your 
call to the next tower. To coordinate the handoff, the cellular network tells 
the handset to switch to the new channel. At the same time, the Internet 
data link is also switched to the new channel and tower.
	Why do I need a data plan? Mobile broadband providers typically 
offer two plans: voice and data. They can be separated because voice and 
data travel over essentially two different networks.
Voice calls travel from a tower to a circuit-switched network and then to 
public switched telephone network land lines. Data travels from a tower to a 
packet-switched network and then to the Internet. 
Text messages travel over the circuit-switched network along with voice 
calls, but they are handled by SMS service centers for yet another billing 
charge. Text messages can be sent successfully even when signal strength 
is low because they are a store-and-forward technology that does not 
require a round-trip circuit to be established between sender and receiver.

	How fast is mobile broadband service? Mobile broadband has 
evolved through several generations. The most recent of these generations 
are 3G and 4G. 
3G (third generation) service was available in the United States beginning 
in 2001. Common protocols included CDMA, which reached maximum 
download speeds of 4.9 Mbps, and GSM EDGE, with 1.6 Mbps speeds.
4G (fourth generation) technologies, such as WiMAX and LTE, rolled out 
in 2011. Of the two, LTE is most widespread. LTE has maximum download 
rates of 300 Mbps and upload rates of 75 Mbps. The actual speeds enjoyed 
by consumers are significantly slower. In the United States, speeds of 13 
Mbps are common, whereas in Sweden, speeds reach 25 Mbps. 
Mobile broadband speed decreases at the edges of coverage. It can be 
reduced by obstacles, such as trees, hills, walls, and even metal roofs. 
Electromagnetic interference from speakers, microwave ovens, and other 
electrical devices can reduce speeds, too. Rain, snow, and high humidity 
can also reduce speeds.
	Can I get mobile broadband for my laptop? Mobile broadband 
isn’t just for your smartphone. You can also use it to access the Internet 
from a laptop or desktop computer. Most of today’s smartphones include a 
tethering feature that connects wirelessly with other digital devices. Figure 
3-43 demonstrates how to set up tethering to create a mobile hotspot. Just 
remember that data sent over the tethered connection accumulates toward 
your monthly data usage total.

Wi-Fi Hotspots
Wi-Fi hotspots are everywhere. Pull out your smartphone in any coffee 
shop, airport, hotel lobby, or university building and you’ll likely find more 
than one network that serves as an Internet on-ramp. But public Wi-Fi 
hotspots are fraught with security risks, so it pays to know how they work.
	How do Wi-Fi hotspots work? A Wi-Fi hotspot is a wireless local 
area network, usually operated by a business, that offers Internet access to 
the public. The network has an Internet connection and a device called an 
access point that broadcasts Wi-Fi signals within a range of about 150 feet. 
Any and all devices with Wi-Fi capability can detect the signal (Figure 3-44). 
	How fast is hotspot access? The speed of a hotspot is related to the 
speed of the Wi-Fi network and the service that connects it to the Internet. 
A hotspot that goes through a 1 Mbps DSL line will be slower than a hotspot 
that goes through a 22 Mbps cable Internet connection. You can expect 
speeds of 2–8 Mbps, but the speed can vary depending on your distance 
from the access point, the number of people logged in, and interference 
from other networks.
	Is hotspot access secure? The data that travels over unsecured 
hotspots is not encrypted, so eavesdroppers can easily tap into data that 
flows over the network. Figure 3-45 summarizes hotspot risk levels.

Browsing. When using a Wi-Fi hotspot for simple browsing activities such 
as checking sports scores, reading Google news, and looking for direc-
tions, your security risk is fairly low if your computer’s antivirus software 
is up to date. 
Using secure sites. Your security risk is low when you are accessing 
secured Web sites that have addresses beginning with HTTPS. These 
secured sites, which are used for activities such as online banking, access-
ing medical records, and making credit card purchases, encrypt the data 
that you enter to keep it safe from eavesdroppers. 
File sharing. Eavesdroppers might be able to access the files on your com-
puter if you have file sharing turned on. When using public networks, you 
should turn file sharing off. You can do so manually if your operating sys-
tem does not offer that option when you connect.
Using unsecured sites. When you log in to unsecured sites while using 
public Wi-Fi hotspots, a wireless eavesdropper could potentially snag 
your user ID and password information, then use it later to access your 
accounts. Logging in to your Webmail account, for example, could be 
risky if your user ID and password are transmitted over an unsecured  
connection.

	How do I access a Wi-Fi hotspot? Your computer’s networking utili-
ties automatically sense a Wi-Fi network and add it to the list of available 
connections. You can then connect using your network utilities. Some Wi-Fi 
hotspots can be accessed simply by starting your browser and accepting 
the license.
Select public networks with care. Hackers create networks that have names 
similar to those of legitimate hotspots. If you mistakenly connect to one of 
these networks, any passwords you enter or data you transmit could fall into 
the hands of a hacker. You can view a list of available networks and connect 
to one as shown in Figure 3-46.

LAN Basics
In the early years of personal computers, networks were scarce. Most 
personal computers functioned as standalone units, and computing was 
essentially a solitary activity in which one person interacted with one com-
puter. Some computer engineers, however, had the foresight to anticipate 
that personal computers could be networked to provide advantages not 
available with standalone computers. 
	What are the characteristics of LANs? Local area networks are 
often referred to as LANs. They are designed to provide connectivity for 
devices within a limited area, typically within the premises of a home, office 
building, business, or school.
LANs use many of the same network technologies as the Internet, just on 
a smaller scale. They have a topology. They use communication protocols 
to ship packets. They require communication channels such as cables or 
wireless signals. They also include data communication equipment such 
as routers and modems. Figure 3-47 illustrates a LAN that you can easily 
build.

	Are there different kinds of LANs? LANs can be classified by their 
protocols; Ethernet and Wi-Fi are the two most popular. The Windows oper-
ating system includes a tool for setting up a LAN called a homegroup that 
makes it easy to share files among local computers, but does not provide 
Internet access. OS X also provides a quick setup tool for making a point-
to-point connection between two computers. Most LANs, however, are set 
up using a router so that they have proper security and Internet access.
	Are LANs regulated by the government? Most wireless LANs 
use the 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz unlicensed frequencies so that they can be 
set up without applying to the FCC for permission. The few unlicensed fre-
quencies are crowded, however, and neighboring networks that are forced 
to use the same frequencies pose security risks.
	Are my devices equipped to access LANs? The circuitry that 
enables a device to access a LAN is called a network interface controller 
(NIC). NICs are built into the circuit boards of most digital devices. NICs are 
also available as add-on circuit boards and USB devices.
NICs contain a MAC address (media access control address) used to 
uniquely identify devices on LANs. MAC addresses are usually assigned by 
the manufacturer of digital devices and embedded in the hardware. 
A MAC address functions in conjunction with an IP address on a LAN. 
Each device on a LAN has a MAC address (sometimes listed as the Wi-Fi 
address or physical address). DHCP assigns an IP address to a device and 
links it to the device’s MAC address. Figure 3-48 illustrates how to find the 
MAC address on various devices.
Figure 3-48: Find the MAC Address
Terminology
The term MAC address has 
nothing to do with Apple’s 
Mac computers. Both PCs and

Ethernet
The first computer networks were configured with wired connections. These 
networks used a variety of topologies and protocols, but a technology called 
Ethernet emerged as the dominant standard and became a key element in 
large and small computer networks.
	What is Ethernet? Ethernet is a wired network technology that is 
defined by IEEE 802.3 standards. It was first deployed in 1976 and is 
now used for wired connections in just about every local area network.
	Why is Ethernet so popular? Ethernet’s success is attributable to 
several factors:
Easy. Ethernet is easy to understand, implement, manage, and maintain. 
Secure. The wired connections in an Ethernet LAN are more secure than 
wireless LAN technologies.
Inexpensive. As a nonproprietary technology, Ethernet equipment is avail-
able from a variety of vendors, and market competition keeps prices low. 
Flexible. Current Ethernet standards allow extensive flexibility in network 
configurations to meet the needs of small and large installations.
Compatible. Ethernet is compatible with popular Wi-Fi wireless technol-
ogy, so it is easy to mix wired and wireless devices on a single network.
	How does Ethernet work? Ethernet was originally a bus topology 
in which computers were all strung along a cable like birds on a power line. 
Today’s Ethernet LANs are usually arranged in a star topology with comput-
ers wired to central switching circuitry that is incorporated in modern routers. 
Data sent from a computer on the network is transmitted to the router, which 
then sends the data to the destination device (Figure 3-49).
Terminology
IEEE is the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers, a 
professional organization that 
develops technical standards in 
areas such as electronics and 
networking. These standards 
are grouped and numbered. 
Many IEEE LAN standards begin 
with the number 802. 
The central router handles all the traffic within the Ethernet. The 
router receives data and then broadcasts it to all of the nodes. The data 
is accepted only by the device to which it was addressed.

	How fast is Ethernet? The original Ethernet standard carried data 
over a coaxial cable at 10 Mbps. Ethernet encompasses a family of LAN 
technologies that offer various data transmission rates as shown in Figure 
3-50. Today, most personal computers and LAN equipment work with 
Gigabit Ethernet.

	How can I tell if a device is Ethernet ready? Many computers 
have a built-in Ethernet port located on the system case. The port looks 
very similar to an oversized telephone jack (Figure 3-51). 
Figure 3-51: Does your computer have an ethernet port?
An Ethernet port is 
slightly larger than

want a wired network connection but your computer has no Ethernet 
port, you can purchase and install an Ethernet adapter (also called an 
Ethernet card). A USB Ethernet adapter plugs into a USB port and can 
be used with laptop and desktop computers. You also have the option of 
installing an Ethernet card in an expansion slot inside the system unit of 
a desktop computer. Figure 3-52 illustrates two types of adapters for add-
ing Ethernet ports.

Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi refers to a set of wireless networking technologies defined by IEEE 
802.11 standards. A Wi-Fi device transmits data as radio waves and is 
compatible with Ethernet, so you can use the two technologies in a single 
network. 
	How does Wi-Fi work? You can set up Wi-Fi in two ways. One option 
is to use wireless mesh topology in which devices broadcast directly to each 
other (Figure 3-53). 
Wireless ad-hoc networks are conceptually simple but provide few security 
safeguards. This type of connection is best limited to occasional use when you 
want to temporarily connect two computers to share a few files. 
Figure 3-53: Wireless mesh configuration
Figure 3-54: Wireless star configuration
A second option for Wi-Fi networks is a star topology in which a cen-
tralized broadcasting device—a wireless access point—coordinates 
communication among network devices. Technically, the centralized device 
is a wireless access point, but that function is built into most routers (Figure 
3-54). 
The most common wireless network technology uses a centralized device to 
handle data that travels from one device to another. 
QuickCheck
Which Wi-Fi infrastructure is 
most similar to Ethernet?
a. 	Wireless ad-hoc
b.	 Wireless infrastructure
Terminology
Wireless mesh networks 
are sometimes called peer 
networks or ad-hoc networks. 
Wireless networks that depend 
on a router are sometimes 
called wireless infrastructure 
networks or managed 
networks.

	How can I tell if a device is Wi-Fi ready? Today, Wi-Fi capability 
is included with just about every desktop, laptop, tablet, and smartphone. 
Don’t worry if your device has no visible antenna for transmitting and receiv-
ing data; the antenna is likely integrated into the case. Older equipment 
without Wi-Fi can be outfitted with a Wi-Fi adapter that plugs into a USB 
port or an internal expansion slot. 
	How fast is Wi-Fi? Wi-Fi is available in several versions that oper-
ate at different speeds and have different ranges. The current standard is 
802.11n. The emerging standard is 802.11ac.
With wired connections, such as Ethernet, the rated speed and range are 
usually very close to actual performance. Wireless connection speed and 
range, however, are often theoretical maximums because signals can eas-
ily deteriorate. Although Wi-Fi 802.11n is capable of 600 Mbps speeds, its 
actual performance is normally 50–100 Mbps. 802.11ac has a theoretical 
speed of 7 Gbps, but actual speeds are 400–800 Mbps.
	What is the range of a Wi-Fi network? Wi-Fi signals may reach 
up to 300 feet (90 meters) from the router. Thick cement walls, steel beams, 
and other environmental obstacles can drastically reduce this range.
The standard that is used to transmit data—whether it is 802.11n or the 
faster 802.11ac—depends on the router and your network device. A smart-
phone with 802.11n Wi-Fi cannot send data at 802.11ac speeds even if the 
network has an 802.11ac router. When setting up a Wi-Fi network, check 
your devices. The router you select should support the fastest device you’ll 
want to use on the network. Routers have several ways to boost speed 
(Figure 3-55).

Speed: Router speed can be designated by a single 
number or a combination of numbers. A single 
number, such as 300 Mbps, means that the router 
transmits one set of signals at a given bit rate. A 
combination of numbers, such as 300+300, means 
that the router can transmit more than one set of 
signals. Such a router might be sold as a 600N router, 
but savvy consumers understand that no single 
device connected to such a modem can use all 600 
Mbps; each connection is limited to 300 Mbps.
Bands: Wi-Fi can be transmitted over 2.4 GHz or 5 
GHz frequencies. When a router uses both frequen-
cies, it is referred to as dual-band. Dual-band offers 
flexibility to support various network devices and 
also can overcome interference on either of the 
bands.
Antennas: Devices with one or more antennas use 
MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) technol-
ogy to boost signals and spread them more evenly 
over the signal range. Routers usually have one to 
four antennas; more antennas generally mean more 
coverage area and good speed even as devices get 
farther from the router.

Set up Your Own Network
Having your own network is great. You can access the Internet from multiple 
devices, share files, and download apps to your smartphone without maxing 
out your data plan. But LANs can be a security risk. Here’s how to set up 
your own safe and secure LAN. 
	What’s the general procedure for setting up a network? The 
basic steps for setting up a LAN are:
   Plug in the router and connect it to your Internet modem. 
   Configure the router.
	   Connect wired and wireless devices.
	How do I connect the router to my Internet modem? Use a 
cable to connect the router’s WAN port to the Internet modem’s Ethernet 
port (Figure 3-56).
Figure 3-56: Connect the Router to the Internet Modem 
	How do I set up a router? A router has no screen or keyboard of its 
own; so to access the router’s configuration software, you’ll use a computer 
and connect to the router using a browser. Instructions are included with the 
router. 
Change the password. The first step is to change the router password. All 
routers are shipped with a standard password. Your router can be accessed 
and controlled by anyone who enters that password until you’ve created a 
secure password as shown in Figure 3-57. 
Software © 1992-2012 Cisco Systems Inc. All rights reserved
The Administration 
tab on this router’s 
configuration utility 
allows you to change 
the password.

WAN or Internet 
port to the modem

Create an SSID. After changing the router password, you can create an 
SSID for your network. An SSID (service set identifier) is the name of a 
wireless network. In areas where there are overlapping wireless networks, 
such as in a city or on a college campus, SSIDs help you log in to the right 
network, rather than a network run by a hacker who will try to suck impor-
tant information off your computer as soon as you connect.
At the same time you change the router password, you can decide whether 
or not you want to broadcast the SSID. When SSID broadcasting is turned 
on, any wireless device passing by can see that a network exists. With 
SSID broadcasting turned off, the public can’t see it. Unfortunately, hack-
ers armed with the right tools can see the network even if the SSID is not 
broadcast. Go ahead and broadcast the SSID as shown in Figure 3-58. You 
can use encryption to secure the network.
Figure 3-58: Create an SSID 
Software © 1992-2012 Cisco Systems Inc.

Enter a name for 
your network 
as the SSID and 
then enable SSID 
broadcasting.
Try IT!
Check your computer. What is 
the SSID for the network you’re 
currently using? (Hint: Click 
the Wi-Fi icon to see a list of 
networks.) 
Activate encryption. Wireless encryption scrambles the data trans-
mitted between wireless devices and then unscrambles the data only on 
devices that have a valid encryption key. WEP (wired equivalent privacy) is 
the oldest and weakest wireless encryption protocol. WPA (Wi-Fi Protected 
Access) and its cousins, WPA2 and PSK, offer more security. Use the stron-
gest encryption that is available. 
When setting up encryption, you’ll create a wireless encryption key 
(sometimes referred to as a network security key or password). The key is 
similar to a password. Any devices that connect to your secure LAN must 
have this key. Figure 3-59 illustrates how to activate wireless encryption on 
a router.

Configure the Guest network. A Guest network is essentially a sec-
ond network that you can configure on your LAN’s router. Guest networks 
allow visitors to access the Internet through your LAN, but don’t allow them 
to access other resources on your network, such as your data files. Some 
routers come preconfigured with a Guest network. You should be sure to 
check its settings to verify that they meet your security requirements.
You can view Guest network settings using your router’s configuration soft-
ware. Your Guest network will have its own SSID and security settings. You 
may be allowed to change these settings, or the router manufacturer may 
have designated permanent settings.
If the Guest network is secured, it should have its own unique encryption 
key or password, which you’ll have to supply to your visitors. Leaving the 
Guest network unsecured makes access open to anyone—not a good idea. 
Even when secured, a Guest network offers a potential security risk, so it 
should be disabled when you are not expecting visitors. 
Activate DHCP. Each workstation requires a unique address for send-
ing and receiving data. When you configure your router to act as a DHCP 
server, it will automatically assign an address to each device that joins your 
network. Figure 3-60 illustrates how to set up DHCP.
Figure 3-60: ACTIVATE DHCP 
Enable DHCP.
You can adjust the 
range of addresses 
assigned for addi-
tional security.

	How do I connect devices to a LAN? Simply connect wired devices 
to the router using a Category 5 network cable. Routers automatically 
sense wired devices and allow them to initiate a connection. A password is 
not needed for wired devices because the signals do not travel through the 
air, where they are easy to intercept. 
A wireless router is constantly broadcasting its SSID. Wireless devices, 
such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets, sense the router’s signal and 
add the SSID to a list of nearby networks. The first time you connect to a 
secured network, you must enter the encryption key. Your device remem-
bers the key for future logins.

IoT Networks
Those plants you’re growing indoors need constant attention. Would you 
like a text message when they need water? The Internet of Things connects 
active sensors and passive tags to communication networks, making it easy 
to remotely monitor places and things.
	Do IoT networks use Wi-Fi technology? Most sensors use bat-
tery power to collect data and to transmit it. Extended battery life is 
possible only if these activities consume small amounts of power. 
Wi-Fi is fairly power hungry, so it is not an optimal IoT technology.  
Existing wireless technologies such as RFID and NFC offer potential 
solutions. Additional low-power short-range technologies developed spe-
cifically for IoT networks include Bluetooth Smart, ZigBee, and Z-Wave.
	What’s the difference between a sensor and a tag? A sensor, 
such as a thermometer or heart rate monitor, actively collects data. A tag 
contains passive data. An RFID tag in a passport, for example, contains per-
sonal data, such as the name and birth date that are stored on the tag, which 
can be read electronically. An NFC tag might be attached to merchandise, 
for example, so that you can tap it with your cell phone to see its price and 
specifications.
Tags can be battery powered, but many RFID and NFC tags contain no 
power source of their own and depend on the receiving device to provide the 
power for data exchange. Data from tags like the ones in Figure 3-65 can 
be read by network devices and used for identification, for making electronic 
payments, and for tracking things or people.
	What kinds of sensor input and output do networks carry? 
Sensors can use networks to transmit the data they collect to other devices 
for storage and output. For example, data from sensors that monitor the 
energy usage of your air conditioning unit relative to indoor and outdoor 
temperatures might be stored on your home network, on your electric com-
pany’s server, or on the sensor manufacturer’s cloud storage service.
Networks also provide a way to access the sensors remotely, such as when 
you use your smartphone at work to adjust the temperature of your home 
thermostat.
	How do IoT networks work? When this textbook went to press, the 
Internet of Things was an emerging technology, and many visions for its 
implementation existed. The most prevalent configuration is to link sensors 
to a base station, which can then ship data to routers in local area networks 
and the Internet. Sensors can be linked in a star topology or, if the sensors 
need to share data, in a mesh topology.
Terminology
RFID stands for radio-frequency 
identification. RFID tags have 
a range of about 300 feet (100 
meters). NFC stands for near 
field communication. NFC tags 
have a range of just four inches 
(10 cm).

	How do sensors communicate with an IoT network? IoT sen-
sors can be wired to a base station, but more typically they are equipped 
with some type of communication device that allows them to wirelessly 
send and receive signals. XBee chips use radio signals to transport data 
wirelessly. Devices like the one shown in Figure 3-66 can easily pair with 
sensors in small form factor packages.
	Are IoT networks secure? Data passing over IoT networks can seem 
trivial, but is it? Do you care if anyone else knows that your fitness wrist-
band recorded lots of activity between midnight and 3:00 am last Saturday? 
As the IoT collects more and more data about our personal lives and the 
machines that run factory and power-grid infrastructures, security becomes 
crucial.
Secure IoT networks encrypt data transmissions, store data in encrypted 
format, password protect access to base stations, and expose the least pos-
sible amount of data to the public Internet. As you begin to collect wearable 
devices and home monitoring sensors, think carefully about the security of 
the data they collect, transport, and store.

File sharing basics
Networks provide access to all types of files. From Snapchats to feature-
length movies, from magazine articles to full-length novels, and from 
sound effects to symphonies, a wide variety of files exist on local networks 
and on the Internet.
You may spend lots of time downloading files to your local devices, but 
there are also times when you want to upload files to share them with 
others. File sharing makes the magic happen.
	What is file sharing? File sharing allows files containing docu-
ments, photos, music, and more to be accessed from computers other 
than the one on which they are stored. Sharing can take place within a 
LAN or across multiple networks, including the Internet.
	How does file sharing work? When computers connect to other 
computers on a network, their users may be able to view a list of files 
stored on the remote device. Given permission, users can open, view, 
edit, copy, and delete files from the remote device. 
	Are there restrictions on file sharing? Your ability to share files 
with other devices on a network depends on several factors, which are 
listed in Figure 3-67.

	What if other network devices aren’t listed? The network utilities 
provided by operating systems such as Windows and OS X automatically 
detect other devices when network discovery is turned on. Network dis-
covery is a setting that affects whether your computer can see other devices 
on a network, and whether your computer can be seen by others.
When network discovery is turned on, other computers that connect to your 
local area network display the name of your computer in the list of network 
devices. When network discovery is off, the name of your computer will not 
appear in the list of network devices. Network discovery works in different 
ways on different devices.
Mobile devices. The operating systems on mobile devices may not offer 
a way to see other devices on a network or to broadcast their presence on 
a network. 
Macs. OS X devices, such as iMacs, have no user-modifiable network dis-
covery settings, but offer file sharing settings instead. If file sharing is On, 
then network discovery is enabled. 
Windows. Some operating systems, such as Windows 7 and 8, offer a net-
work discovery setting that allows users to turn network discovery off or on. 
When using public networks, this setting should be off (Figure 3-69).
Figure 3-69: Network discovery settings in Windows
When using a public network, such as a Wi-Fi hotspot, turning network discov-
ery off hides your computer from other users connected to the network. One 
caveat: The network administrator can see your device using router utilities 
even when network discovery is off.

Sharing your files
There are occasions when you’d like to share files stored on your computer 
with other people who are using your network. You may have guests who 
want to copy some of your sports photos, or you might want to transfer files 
from an old computer to a new one. Once computers can see each other on 
a network, sharing files is easy—but take care to do it securely.
	How secure is file sharing? File sharing poses security risks that 
have several dimensions. Shared files are subject to misuse, inadvertent 
modifications, and intentional alterations by those who have access to 
them. In addition, security holes in file sharing routines are notorious for 
providing Internet-based hackers with unauthorized access to computers. 
If you don’t need to share files, turn off file sharing globally. If you want the 
convenience of sharing files, limit what you share and who you share it with 
by following the tips in Figure 3-71. 
QuickCheck
Suppose you would like to 
allow friends to access some 
photos, but you don’t want 
them to make changes. What 
permissions would you assign?
a.	 Read
b.	 Read and write 
c.	 Write
d.	 Drop box
Terminology
Permissions are also referred 
to as user rights or privileges.
Remove sharing from 
files you no longer 
want to share.
	What are permissions? Permissions specify how shared files can 
be used. 
Read and write permission (full control) allows access for opening, 
viewing, modifying, and deleting files. 
Read permission allows authorized people to open a file and view it, but 
they are not allowed to modify or delete it. 
Write-only permission works like a drop box, allowing people to put 
files in one of your folders, but not open, copy, or change any files that you 
have stored there.
	Can I control how files are modified? You can control who modi-
fies a file, but not what they do to it. Once a shared file is bestowed with read 
and write permission, it can be modified to the extent that it is unrecogniz-
able. If you are not checking shared files frequently, you may be surprised 
by what some of those files contain. You can see the potential problem. 
Read and write permission is not to be given without considerable thought.
One important consideration about file sharing is whether to provide access 
to the original file or to a copy of it. Your decision depends on the reason for 
sharing the file.
As a general guideline, do not offer read and write access to the original 
version of a file. Instead, make a copy of the file and designate the copy as 
shared with write permissions. If the file gets modified in some bizarre way, 
you will have a version of the original file that was not shared or modified.

Internet-BaseD Sharing
As more and more activity moves to the cloud, companies that provide 
cloud services have increased their interest in encouraging consumers 
to use those services. Cloud storage and sharing services are commonly 
hyped as being more convenient and more secure than local options, but 
many consumers are wary of cloud security, not to mention the rampant 
advertising that accompanies many of the free cloud storage services. 
The concept of pulling files from remote servers traces back to a protocol 
called FTP. Newer technologies now power Dropbox and similar services. 
So what are they all about?
	What is FTP? FTP (File Transfer Protocol) provides a way to transfer 
files from one computer to another over any TCP/IP network, such as a 
LAN or the Internet. The purpose of FTP is to make it easy to upload and 
download computer files without having to deal directly with the operating 
system or file management system of a remote computer. FTP also allows 
authorized remote users to change file names and delete files.
	How can I access FTP servers? You can access FTP servers with 
FTP client software, such as FileZilla, or with a browser. Addresses of FTP 
servers usually begin with ftp, rather than www. To use a Web browser to 
download a file, simply enter the address of the FTP server as shown in 
Figure 3-74. 
Figure 3-74: FTP From Your Browser
1. Enter the address of the FTP server in the browser’s address bar. At an 
anonymous FTP server, a user ID and password would not be necessary.
3. It is safe to open the down-
loaded file if your antivirus 
software checked it. Otherwise, run 
a manual scan before opening it.
2. Select the file you 
want to download.

In the late 1990s, an online service called Napster burst onto the national 
scene when college students became aware that it provided free access to 
thousands of music downloads. Napster ran into some copyright infringe-
ment difficulties, but the concept of sharing files over the Internet spurred 
development of sophisticated, distributed protocols such as BitTorrent.
	What is BitTorrent? BitTorrent is a file sharing protocol that distrib-
utes the role of a file server across a collection of dispersed computers. If 
you envision data traveling over a mesh rather than a star, you’ll have a 
general idea of the difference between a distributed file sharing system and 
a centralized system such as iTunes. However, BitTorrent’s mesh topology 
is logical, not physical. Your computer is still physically a part of a LAN with 
a star topology that accesses BitTorrent through a router. BitTorrent’s logi-
cal mesh topology is simply a way of envisioning the path of data.
A BitTorrent network is designed to reduce the bandwidth bottleneck that 
occurs when many people attempt to download the same very large file, 
such as a feature-length film, application software, or an interactive 3-D 
computer game. 
	How does BitTorrent work? Suppose that 100 computers request 
the newly released sequel to the film The Hunger Games at about the same 
time. A server breaks the movie file into pieces and begins to download 
those pieces to the first computer that requested the movie. 
As more computers request the file, they become part of a “swarm” that 
uses peer-to-peer technology to exchange movie segments with each 
other. After the server has downloaded all the segments to the swarm, its 
job is complete and it can service other requests. The swarm continues to 
exchange movie segments until every computer in the swarm has the entire 
movie (Figure 3-76). 
QuickCheck
What is unique about 
BitTorrent?
a.	 It doesn’t supply files from a 
central server.
b.	 It has a logical topology.
c.	 It uses FTP protocols.
d.	 It uses encryption instead of 
permissions.

	How do I use BitTorrent? BitTorrent client software is currently avail-
able from several Web sites. After installing the client, you can use it to 
download from any BitTorrent-enabled site simply by clicking the file you 
want. The BitTorrent client handles the entire file swapping procedure. After 
getting the entire file, good etiquette requires clients to remain connected to 
the swarm so that they can “seed” file pieces to others. 
BitTorrent is introducing other services built on the distributed sharing 
model. In an era when so much data is consolidated in the server farms of a 
few online services such as Facebook, iCloud, and Dropbox, unauthorized 
access by hackers and government agencies is rampant. 
Distributed systems such as BitTorrent have the potential to offer server-
less communication services, such as chat. Instead of connecting through a 
centralized server, you can use distributed resources to set up communica-
tion links. 
	Are BitTorrent and similar file swapping networks legal? 
File sharing originated on Internet-based file servers, which held huge col-
lections of popular music stored as digital MP3 files that could be easily 
downloaded and played on a computer or transferred to CDs. Free distri-
bution of music without the copyright holder’s permission is illegal, and file 
sharing server operators quickly encountered the legal ramifications of their 
computers’ shady dealings.
Peer-to-peer file sharing networks and distributed technologies such as 
BitTorrent have legitimate uses for distributing music, images, videos, and 
software with the approval of copyright holders. Peter Jackson’s production 
diaries for King Kong have been posted for download using BitTorrent tech-
nology. Universal Studios and several independent film companies have 
released movie trailers with BitTorrent technology. The technology itself is 
not illegal; it is the use of the technology that is subject to legal scrutiny.
	Is BitTorrent safe? Because BitTorrent files are assembled from little 
segments that come from a jumble of computers, they would seem to be 
bad candidates for distributing malware. Intelligent hackers would realize 
that their malicious code could easily be chopped up, too, and that pieces 
of it might not be delivered. And yet BitTorrent files have become a source 
of adware and spyware. If you use BitTorrent, make sure your computer is 
protected with a security software suite that offers good spyware protection.

SECTION A, Unit 3
It all started in October 2007, when the 
FCC accused Comcast of slowing and in some cases 
blocking Internet traffic from BitTorrent. Comcast 
claimed that it was attempting to even the playing field 
for the average Internet user whose online speeds 
were languishing due to file sharing traffic from a 
minority of its customers.
Comcast’s ability to adjust some users’ bandwidth 
for the benefit of other users might seem beneficial 
until you consider that ISPs could manipulate Internet 
speeds to give preferential 
access to certain sites and 
services while slowing access 
to others. That practice could 
essentially give ISPs the power 
to deny access to sites based 
on business, political, or other 
values.
What if your ISP institutes a 
system whereby you have to 
pay extra for high-bandwidth 
services, such as movie downloads? You might be 
thinking, “There ought to be a law against that!” That 
is exactly the opinion of net neutrality supporters.
The term net neutrality was created by Columbia 
media law professor Tim Wu in 2003 in his paper 
Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination. 
Although the term net neutrality is relatively new, its 
roots can be traced to pre-1860 telegram technol-
ogy. Back then, standard telegrams were routed 
equally, without discrimination, and without regard to 
their contents, source, or recipient. Telegraphs were 
end-to-end neutral networks. Because telegraph 
and—later—telephone networks were considered 
to be public utilities, or common carriers, they were 
not allowed to give preferential treatment to one cus-
tomer over another. The Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) was formed to regulate common 
carriers and ensure equal access and fair prices.
As the Internet evolved into a massive communication 
network, the FCC began to regard it as a common 
carrier that should fall under the FCC’s umbrella of 
influence. The first step would be to ban ISPs from 
slowing or blocking traffic indiscriminately. In 2010, 
under the banner of net neutrality, the FCC issued the 
Open Internet Order, a set of regulations designed to 
“preserve the Internet as an open platform enabling 
consumer choice, freedom of expression, end-user 
control, competition, and the freedom to innovate 
without permission.”
Shortly after the Open Internet Order, Comcast was 
back in court again to contest the FCC’s right to regu-
late the Internet. The court ruled in favor of Comcast, 
based on the fact that the FCC’s jurisdiction did not 
extend to the Internet.
Yet the FCC persisted. In 2014, FCC 
chairman Tom Wheeler proposed a 
compromise form of net neutrality that 
would allow ISPs to offer “faster lane” 
options at a premium rate to content 
providers such as Netflix, Facebook, 
and Amazon. That proposal absolutely 
confused the issue; the FCC’s pro-
posed version of net neutrality was not 
neutral at all. 
Opponents to this new non-neutral neu-
trality pointed out that considering the 
finite amount of bandwidth available on the Internet, 
users outside the proposed “faster lanes” would have 
their bandwidth squeezed while the added cost of fast 
lane services would be passed directly on to the con-
sumers of such services. 
Additionally, opponents of this idea feared that the 
operational costs for fast-lane services would sky-
rocket and those costs would pose barriers to startups 
that operate on small budgets—thus, stifling innova-
tion and competition. The FCC’s “faster lanes” brand 
of net neutrality satisfied no one.
The net neutrality controversy boils down to simple 
ideology: Should the government regulate the Internet 
or not? On the one hand, regulation could prevent 
abusive business practices on the part of ISPs. On 
the other hand, if the Internet were to fall under the 
regulatory control of the FCC, where would the regu-
lation end? The FCC currently regulates telephone 
and cellular service. It imposes a variety of taxes and 
fees that add to your monthly bill. Would similar taxes 
and fees be added to your monthly Internet service? 
And would FCC Internet monitoring add yet more 
points where the government can collect data on the 
activities of its citizens?
Today’s action at the 
FCC could begin the 
dismantling of the open 
Internet as we know it...

◗◗Two sources are better than one. Cross-check 
facts between two or more sites.
◗◗Use common sense. Claims that seem outlandish 
require extra verification.

Fact-Checking Tips
PRIMARY SOURCES
Original material such as 
speeches, interviews, letters, 
photos, email messages, tweets, 
artwork, diaries, laws, database 
reports, and accounting records
Example: A video of Apple’s CEO 
announcing a new music product 
for the iPhone and iPad
SECONDARY SOURCES
Reviews, critiques, panel discus-
sions, biographies, and other 
sources that analyze, summarize, 
or otherwise repackage informa-
tion from primary sources 
Example: An article on Google 
News that describes Apple’s new 
music product
TERTIARY SOURCES
A list or compilation of material that 
pertains to a topic; from sources 
that include bibliographies, dic-
tionaries, almanacs, indexes, 
timelines, and inventory lists
Example: Apple’s ecommerce site 
that lists and sells all versions of 
its new music product
These days, you have to be a skeptic. Bloggers have opinions that are not always based on facts. Scam art-
ists say anything to get your money. Even reputable journalists sometimes make mistakes.
Before you form an opinion, make a decision, or take action based on what you read, see, or hear, you can 
easily use your computer or smartphone to verify facts and look up background information. 
Search Google. You can use Google or a similar search engine to find information from all corners of the 
Web. You can search for information in specific formats, such as videos, images, and news reports. Check 
out Google Scholar for links to authoritative information in peer-reviewed journals, theses, and other profes-
sional publications. Remember that you can formulate searches such as Define DNS spoofing to learn the 
meaning of technical terms and find the meaning of acronyms. 
Search within sites. Rather than conducting a wide-ranging Google search, you can go to a specific Web 
site and search within it. Search Wikipedia for definitions and topic overviews. Search news sites for articles 
and video footage about current events. Start at www.snopes.com or www.hoaxbusters.org to identify email

	 Bob Metcalfe invented Ethernet and its popularity soared as local area networks became popu-
lar in the early 1990s. Ethernet is a wired technology and so it is not surprising that Mr. Metcalfe 
was not enthusiastic about wireless networking technologies. But did he say in a 1993 InfoWorld 
article, “The truth about wireless computing is that it’s not going to pan out.” To find out if this quote 
is accurate, which of the following would provide the most reliable answer?
	
	
a. Use Google to search for the truth about wireless computing. 
	
	
b. Read the Wikipedia article about Robert Metcalfe.
	
	
c. Search for the original InfoWorld article.
	 Suppose you’re gathering information for a term paper about enforcement efforts to stop copyright 
infringement, and you come across the following short article posted on a security blog. You want 
to cover BitTorrent in your report; but before you add material from this article to your research 
notes, you should do a fact check. Go online and find answers to the questions in the diagram 
below.
After four years on the run, Hans 
Christian Andersen, one of the found-
ers of the Swedish file-sharing giant, 
Pirate Bay, was arrested and extradited 
to Sweden.
The 36-year-old Swede, known in 
hacking communities as TiAMO, was 
traveling to Thailand with his Laotian 
wife when he was detained at a border 
checkpoint in Nong Khai under a war-
rant issued by Interpol.
“A US-based film crew managed to 
track down Andersen. I don’t know 
how. Even Interpol was unable to 
locate him,” Immigration Police 
Commissioner Chartchai Eimsaeng 
said.
The BitTorrent site called Pirate Bay, 
founded in 2003, allows users to share 
files through peer-to-peer technology, 
often violating copyright laws.
Andersen is the last of the three co-
founders to be taken into custody. All 
three fled bail after being given one-
year sentences in 2009 and ordered 
to pay $4.8 million in damages to the 
entertainment industry in compensa-
tion for lost profits. 
Pirate Bay Founders Tracked Down
e. Cross check 
these facts. 
Are they cor-
rect? 
c. Check 
the primary 
source: Is this 
quote correct? 
b. Is TiAMO 
his screen 
name?
a. Is this the 
correct name 
of the Pirate 
Bay Founder?
d. Is the his-
torical info 
about Pirate 
Bay accurate?

Technology in Context: Education
The first educational applica-
tion of computers emerged in the 1960s, when huge 
mainframes with clunky interfaces introduced stu-
dents to computer-aided instruction (CAI). Based on 
operant conditioning research by B. F. Skinner and 
Ivan Pavlov—remember dogs salivating when a bell 
rings?—CAI uses basic drill and practice: The com-
puter presents a problem, the student responds, and 
the computer evaluates the response. 
Studies in the 1970s indicated that programmed 
instruction systems, such as Programmed Logic for 
Automated Teaching Operations (PLATO), improved 
test scores, but students soon became bored with 
the monochrome display found and the regimented 
drill format boring. 
Educators know that students have diverse 
learning styles and are equipped with varying 
degrees of background knowledge about a topic. 
Computers, with all their processing power, should 
be able to provide individualized instruction. With 
promising breakthroughs in artificial intelligence 
during the 1980s, deploying computers for indi-
vidualized instruction seemed within easy grasp.  
The problem, however, was more complex than first 
expected. Thirty-some years later, individualized 
instruction in the form of adaptive learning is just 
beginning to mature.
Simulations have become a popular educational tool. 
The computer mimics a real-world situation through 
a narrative description or with graphics. In education, 
two categories of computer simulations have evolved. 
There are educational simulations that mimic real-
world situations, and there are serious games that 
educate within an entertaining environment. Flight 
simulators are an example of real-word simulations, 
whereas Battlefield 1942 is a first-person shooter 
game based on historic World War II battles. The line 
between the two types of simulations is blurred. Is 
Guts and Bolts an anatomy simulation or a game for 
designing bizarre organisms?
Most educators believe that computers can help 
create an individualized and interactive learning 
environment, which can make learning more effec-
tive and efficient. According to the National Center 
for Education Statistics, 99% of American public 
schools have computers and 93% of students use 
them in some way. However, these statistics can be 
deceiving. The reality falls far short of the ideal situa-
tion in which every student has access to a computer 
throughout the school day.
The challenge for K–12 schools is to figure out how 
to achieve the computers’ potential in an educational 
setting when supplying computers for every student 
is often cost prohibitive. Compromise solutions have 
been tried with varying degrees of success. Some 
schools have installed learning labs where students 
go for scheduled lab time. In elementary schools, 
often a few computers are placed in special work 
areas of classrooms and used for small group projects 
or individual drill and practice. Some schools have rel-
egated most computers to the library, where they are 
connected to the Internet and used for research. In 
some classrooms, a single computer can be used as 
an effective presentation device.
An emerging bring your own technology (BYOT) trend 
in elementary schools encourages students to bring 
their own devices to class. Laptops, smartphones, 
and even video game consoles—any device that can 
access the Web—might be used to access a wide 
variety of online educational content. The challenge 
for teachers is to find appropriate content and inte-
grate it into the curriculum and lesson plans.
Some schools—primarily colleges—have tackled the 
problem of computer access by requiring all incom-
ing first-year students to purchase laptop computers. 
Most colleges offer campus-wide Wi-Fi service with 
Internet access so that laptop-toting students can 
easily take notes in class, contact instructors via 
email, use the Internet as a research resource, and 
run educational software.

The proliferation of tablet computers has led to a 
bevy of experiments under the umbrella of mLearn-
ing, a buzzword for mobile learning and defined 
as learning that happens across locations, or that 
takes advantage of learning opportunities offered by 
portable technologies. 
Another educational use of computers can be seen 
in distance education (DE) courses (also called dis-
tance learning). 
Historically, distance 
education meant cor-
respondence study 
or courses delivered 
by radio or television, 
but the meaning has 
been broadened to 
encompass any edu-
cational situation in 
which students and 
instructors aren’t 
in the same place. 
Therefore, most 
DE courses today 
require students to 
have access to a 
computer and an 
Internet connection. DE courses are offered to K–12 
students, college students, military personnel, busi-
nesspeople, and the general public. 
Most students who choose DE courses do so 
because they want to learn at their own pace, at a 
convenient time, and in a location close to home. 
Single parents who deal with the realities of child 
care, working professionals who cannot relocate 
to a college town, and physically disabled students 
find distance education handy. Distance education 
has the potential of increasing the pool of students 
for a course by making it financially feasible; for 
example, an advanced Kanji course could be offered 
at a Midwestern university with only ten on‑campus 
Japanese majors if enough distance education stu-
dents can boost enrollment.
The Internet hosts a wide variety of DE courses, both 
credit-earning and noncredit courses. Online courses 
can be presented to a small group of enrollees or to 
huge numbers of students. The trend toward massive 
open online courses (MOOCs) gained momentum 
when 160,000 students enrolled in an online course 
in artificial intelligence offered by Sebastian Thrun 
and Peter Norvig. This and similar non-credit courses 
are currently offered by Udacity, edX, Coursera, 
and Udemy. They are “open” to enrollments by any-
one; students do not have to be formally admitted 
to a university to participate. Courses are offered by 
instructors from Stanford, MIT, and other prestigious 
schools, so they attract students from all over the 
world.
MOOCs tend to be offered in real time, whereas 
other online courses are posted on the Web and 
can be accessed at any time. Khan Academy, with 
its distinctively col-
orful instructional 
“chalkboard,” is 
representative of 
this type of online 
course. Its video 
lessons (left) cover 
a wide range of 
topics.
Several learning 
management sys-
tems (LMSs), such 
a s  B l a c k b o a r d 
and Moodle, help 
teachers prepare 
and manage DE 
and on-campus 
courses. Learning 
management software typically runs from a server 
maintained by a school system, college, or univer-
sity. Using Web browsers, teachers access the LMS 
to post an online syllabus, develop Web pages with 
course content, create a database of questions for 
online assessment, manage email, set up online dis-
cussion groups, and maintain a gradebook. Students 
using Internet-connected computers and standard 
Web browsers can access course materials, submit 
assignments, interact with other students, and take 
tests. 
Computers and the Internet have opened oppor-
tunities for lifelong learning. Prospective students 
can use a search engine to easily find non-credit 
courses and tutorials for a wide range of topics, 
including pottery, dog grooming, radio astronomy, 
desktop publishing, and drumming. Some tutorials 
are free, and others charge a small fee. 
In a society that promotes learning as a lifelong 
endeavor, the Internet has certainly made it possi-
ble for students of all ages to pursue knowledge and 
skills simply by using a computer and an Internet 
connection.

Flipped Class Projects
Critical Thinking
After completing this unit, you should have a com-
prehensive view of how the Internet works. Based 
on this knowledge, does it seem possible that 
there is some sort of “kill switch” that could turn off 
large swaths of the Internet? Suppose there was a 
period of extreme political unrest in your country. 
Would it be conceivable that your country’s leader, 
or perhaps a group of technologically savvy insur-
gents, could shut down the Internet? Think about 
the question on your own for a bit, then check 
online for additional opinions. Does your govern-
ment have an official statement on this issue?
Group Project
The purpose of this project is to explore file shar-
ing within your school network. Work in groups of 
three or four, with at least two computers equipped 
with Wi-Fi in your group. Begin by checking which 
files and folders are designated as shareable. 
Make only one folder sharable on each computer 
and be sure that it contains no files that would 
reveal personal information. Next, turn on network 
discovery (PCs only) and file sharing. Can the 
computers see each other? Why or why not? Are 
the computers able to share files? Discuss why file 
sharing is or is not possible within the network you 
are using.
Cyberclassroom
Students sometimes hesitate to state their opin-
ions or ask questions in class. Can network 
technology offer more opportunities for interac-
tion? For this project, work in groups of five to 
research three technologies that can be used as 
classroom response systems: Poll Everywhere, 
GoSoapBox, and Socrative. Set up one of these 
systems and try it among the five people in your 
group. How would you rate it for increasing the 
quality of your classroom experience?
Multimedia Project
Run Traceroute from your computer to various 
domains until you get a report that contains 10–15 
hops. You might have to try several destinations 
to obtain a trace that is not too long. Next, use an 
online WHOIS search to find the location of each 
router in the trace. To find the location, copy the IP 
address into the WHOIS search box. Finally, use a 
Google map to create a visual track of the packets 
from your computer to their destination.
Resume Builder
Bluetooth advocates champion the idea of 
exchanging electronic business cards. Suppose 
you’re working in the technology department of a 
corporation and your boss asks you to research 
the value of this concept for the company’s sales 
representatives. After completing your research, 
write a one-page memo that summarizes your 
findings about cost and usefulness.
Globalization
The model for telecommunications in most tech-
nologically advanced countries depends on large 
telecommunication corporations for telephone and 
Internet access. The infrastructure costs are huge. 
Can you envision ways in which people in techno-
logically underdeveloped countries could benefit 
from inexpensive network technologies? Jot down 
your initial thoughts, then search the Web for addi-
tional ideas. Write a one-page executive summary 
that describes your opinion.

SECTION A: Networks can be classified by geo-
graphical scope as PANs, 
 , and 
WANs. The cables and signals used to transport data 
from one network device to another are a communication 
 . Wired channels include twisted pair 
wires, 
 cables used for cable television, 
and 
 -optic cables used for high-capac-
ity trunk lines. Wireless channels use 
 
signals and microwaves. Government agencies regulate some 
wireless 
 . The transmission capac-
ity of a channel is referred to as 
 . 
Channels that are capable of moving at least 2 Mbps are clas-
sified as 
 . Networks can be config-
ured in various 
 , such as star, mesh, 
point-to-point, or bus. Any device in a network is referred to as 
a(n) 
 . Data 
 
equipment includes computers. Data 
 
equipment includes modems and routers. Additional 
DCEs include hubs, switches, bridges, repeaters, and 
 access points. Networks use physical, 
transport, and arrival communication 
 
to set of the rules for efficiently transmitting data and handling 
errors.
SECTION B: The Internet is based on a U.S. govern-
ment project called 
 . Today, the 
Internet is a collection of networks, tied together by com-
mon 
 . Tier 1 networks form the 
Internet 
 , a system of high-capac-
ity routers and fiber-optic communication links arranged in 
a(n) 
 topology. Networks that form 
the Internet are maintained by 
 that 
offer access to consumers. Before data travels over the 
Internet, it is divided into 
 by a pro-
tocol called 
 , which also reassem-
bles the data when it reaches its destination. Every device 
on the Internet uses an IP address. 
 
addresses are 32 bits long, whereas 
 
addresses are 128 bits long, providing billions and bil-
lions of possible addresses. Addresses are assigned by 
 servers. IP addresses that are tempo-
rarily assigned are called 
 addresses, 
whereas permanent ones are called 
 
addresses. 
 IP addresses cannot be 
routed over the Internet and are usually assigned to devices 
within LANs. Because it is difficult to remember IP addresses, 
the 
 name system allocates easy-
to-remember domain names. 
 -level 
domains include .com and .edu. The servers that track these 
names are a vulnerable point in Internet security.

SECTION D: Local area networks use many of the 
same network technologies and the Internet, only on a smaller 
scale. Devices that access LANs are equipped with a network 
interface 
 that contains circuitry for 
wireless or wired connections. Devices also have a physical 
 address, in addition to the IP addresses 
acquired from a DHCP server. The most popular wired tech-
nology is 
 . The most popular wireless 
technology is 
 , which can be config-
ured as a(n) 
 or star topology. Setting 
up a LAN and configuring its router is fairly easy. The first 
step is to change the standard 
 to one 
that is secure. Next, create a(n) 
 that 
uniquely identifies the network by name. It is also important to 
activate wireless 
 to prevent wireless 
signals from being intercepted during transmission. A limited-
access 
 network can be created for 
visitors to use. By activating 
 , the 
router will be able to assign IP addresses to each device that 
joins the network. To connect to a secure LAN that is pro-
tected by encryption, an encryption 
 , 
or password, is required. LANs can be used to access data 
collected by IoT devices and the networks that tie these 
devices together. Technologies such as RFID, NFC, Bluetooth 
Smart, ZigBee, and Z-Wave offer 
 
-power links, essential for battery-powered devices that can’t 
expend excess amounts of energy transmitting data.
SECTION E: File sharing allows files containing docu-
ments, photos, music, and other data to be accessed from 
computers other than the one on which they are stored. To 
access files on a network, network 
 
allows your computer to see other devices and permits other 
devices to see your computer. Sharing the files on your 
computer poses a security risk, but it is possible to specify 
 for how your shared files can be 
used. File sharing is also possible across networks, as when 
you download files from Internet servers. One technology used 
for this purpose is 
 , which provides 
a way to transfer files over any TCP/IP network. Another file 
sharing protocol called 
 distributes 
the role of a file server across a collection of dispersed com-
puters.
SECTION c: The speed and quality of Internet con-
nections vary. For email and browsing the Web, speeds of 
 Mbps are acceptable, whereas 
Skype video calls require 1.5 Mbps connections. Your band-
width 
 is the top speed allowed by your 
Internet access plan. You can use 
 to 
check the latency of an Internet connection. You can use online 
tools to check for packet loss and 
 , 
which is the variability in packet latency. Another utility called 
 reports the path that your data takes 
to reach its destination. Options for 
 
Internet access include cable, DSL, ISDN, satellite, and 
fiber- to-the-home. 
 access options 
include mobile satellite. 
 Internet access 
is available from cellular services. 
 
Internet service offers dependable connections over coaxial 
and fiber cables. The fastest offering that uses the telephone 
network is 
 . Satellite Internet service 
is available in remote areas but suffers from high rates of 
 . Mobile broadband services offered 
by cell phone companies usually entail separate fees for talk, 
texting, and data. Public Wi-Fi 
 offer yet 
another Internet access option, though users have to be vigi-
lant about security.

1.	
You’re setting up an Ethernet wired network using a router. 
To access the router and its configuration software, you 
open your 
 and type the router’s 
IP address.
2.	
You’re trying to figure out if your computer has a built-in 
Ethernet port. You see the port pictured to the right. Is that 
the port you should use for your Ethernet plug? Yes or no? 
 
3.	
You’re shopping for a new router and are attracted by 
the advertising for a 600N model. Upon examining the 
specifications, you see that the router transmits 300+300, 
so you know it is using 
 broadcast channels. 
4.	
You arrive at work and one of your co-workers tells you 
that the router is down. Is it correct to surmise that your 
workstation will not be able to access other workstations, 
but will be able to access the Internet? Yes or no? 
 
5.	
You have a small network in your house that uses a 
wireless router. For the past week, you’ve seen a black 
SUV parked outside and its occupant seems to be using a 
laptop computer. The first step you should take to discover 
if this person has hacked into your network is: a) knock on 
the car window and ask; b) call the police; or c) use your 
router utilities to check who is connected to your network. 
6.	
You’ve set up a network using some new equipment and 
a few old Wi-Fi adapters given to you by your roommates. 
One of the adapters is equipped only for WEP, whereas all 
the other adapters support WPA2. Your roommate tells you 
that in order to use all the adapters, you’ll have to disable 
wireless encryption. Is your roommate right? 
 
7.	
You’re accustomed to using Dropbox to share files over 
the Internet; but at your new job, files are stored on an 
FTP server. This is not a problem. You know that you can 
access work files using a(n) 
 or FTP 
client software such as FileZilla.
8.	
You’ve got class notes and you don’t mind sharing them 
with your roommates, but you’d prefer that they don’t 
change them. You can keep your notes intact if you assign 
 permission to those files.

Hackers and Government Snoopers love networks. Data flows freely. Most of it is not encrypted. 
Networks are a paradise for anyone who wants to peer into our private lives. But what do these snoopers actually find, 
and how much data must they sort through to find anything valuable? Let’s take a look at the data flowing on your LAN 
and the data that’s exchanged over the Internet.
REQUIREMENTS: 
For this lab, you’ll need a computer running Mac OS X or Windows 7, 8, or 9. Your computer should be connected to a 
Wi-Fi network. The instructions are generalized; they provide helpful guidelines, but not specific steps. You may have to 
explore a bit to find all the tools needed to complete the assignment, but that is all part of the learning experience. 
There are two versions of this assignment: one for computers running Windows and one for computers running OS X. 
The Windows version begins on this page. The OS X version begins on the next page.
WINDOWS ASSIGNMENT:
 Open Task Manager’s Performance tab to view Wi-Fi 
Activity. 
The easiest way to open Task Manager is by typing its 
name into a search box on the Home screen. You can 
also open Control Panel and access Task Manager from 
there. 
Once open, select the Performance tab and use the More 
Details link, if necessary, to display the graph and net-
work statistics.
Arrange your desktop into two windows: one with Task 
Manager and one with a browser. Now navigate to sev-
eral Web sites and note what happens in Task Manager.
The graph uses dotted lines for sent packets and a solid 
line for received packets. What are typical speeds for 
sending and receiving data on your network?
 Monitor Wi-Fi throughput.
Continue watching the Wi-Fi graph when you are not 
using the browser. Why do you think there is Wi-Fi activity 
even when you are not actively using network services?
 Switch to the Processes tab.
The Network column of the Processes tab displays the 
applications that are active. Can you determine which 
applications are sending and receiving data over the 
network even when you are not actively using network 
services?
 Return to the Performance tab and select the Open 
Resource Monitor link.
This set of monitoring tools gives you another view of the 
data that’s traveling to and from your computer. Look at 
the list for Processes with Network Activity.
Do the active processes here match the processes you 
identified in Step 3?
 Monitor TCP connections.
Expand the list of TCP connections, if necessary, by 
selecting the 
 button. The Remote Address column 
displays the IP addresses of servers that have sent pack-
ets to your computer.
Type a few of these IP addresses into a browser Address 
bar. Where do they lead?
 Open the Command Prompt window and enter the 
command: netstat -e
To open the Command Prompt window, you can enter 
cmd from the Windows Home screen. When the window 
opens, enter netstat -e
The netstat command displays the number of bytes sent 
and received. It also displays the number of packets 
you’ve sent and received. 
Unicast packets are simple TCP packets of data. 
Non-unicast packets are broadcast or multicast to mul-
tiple network nodes—typically from DHCP queries and 
Windows services.
You can see that snoopers have to examine lots of pack-
ets to find specific data. Record the number of Unicast 
packets your computer has sent and received.

OS X ASSIGNMENT:
 Open Activity Monitor’s Network tab to view network 
activity. 
The easiest way to open Activity Monitor is to select 
the Applications folder from the dock, select the Utilities 
folder, then select Activity Monitor. 
Once the Activity Monitor window is open, select the 
Network button.
Arrange your desktop into two windows: one with Activity 
Monitor and one with a browser. Now navigate to several 
Web sites and note what happens in Activity Monitor.
The graph uses red for sent packets and blue for 
received packets. Data transport speeds are listed as 
“Data received/sec” and “Data sent/sec.” 
What are typical speeds for sending and receiving data 
on your network?
 Monitor network activity.
Continue watching the graph when you are not using the 
browser. Why do you think there is activity even when 
you are not actively using network services?
 Look at the process chart above the graph.
The Sent Bytes and Rcvd Bytes columns of the chart lists 
active processes and shows when they send or receive 
data. 
Can you determine which applications are sending and 
receiving data over the network even when you are not 
actively using network services?
 Open the Network Utility and start Netstat.
You can find the Network Utility by selecting the 
Applications folder. If the Network Utility is not there, look 
in the Utilities folder.
When the Network Utility window opens, select the 
Netstat tab and then select the option: Display the state 
of all current socket connections.
Click the Netstat button to view the report.
Look at the beginning of the report. The Local Address 
is the origin of outgoing packets. The Foreign Address is 
the source of incoming packets.
List three of the foreign addresses. Use WHOIS to see 
if you can associate them with activities that you have 
recently carried out.

But what’s in those packets? You were able to use utilities to see the number of packets flowing into and out of 
your computer. But what is a packet, exactly? What would a hacker see by using a packet sniffer to tap into your wire-
less communications? What do those government snoopers gather with their sophisticated surveillance? In this extra 
credit lab, you’ll get a glimpse of the packet landscape.
REQUIREMENTS: 
For this lab, you’ll need a computer running Mac OS X or Windows 7, 8, or 9. Your computer should be connected to a 
Wi-Fi network. This part of the lab requires you to download and install software; make sure that you have permission to 
do so. You will need administrative privileges, so you must be logged in as an administrator.
ASSIGNMENT:
 Download and install the free Wireshark packet 
sniffer application. 
Make sure you obtain the download from a trusted site!
The official Wireshark site is www.wireshark.org.
There are versions of Wireshark for Windows and for OS 
X. Be sure to download the correct version. 
 Verify that you are logged in using an administrator 
account, then start Wireshark.
 Set up a capture.
Select the Capture menu, then select Options.
Select an interface. If you have more than one interface 
option, you may have to try more than one to find which is 
sending and receiving packets.
Check Capture packets in promiscuous mode.
Select the Start button.
 View the capture report.
The capture report is displayed in three sections, as 
shown in the figure below. 
Selecting one of the packets in the Packet List displays 
details in the Packet Details and Packet Bytes sections.
The Packet Bytes section contains a capture of what is 
contained in your packets. That’s what snoopers see!
 Take a screenshot of your Wireshark window.
If you’re using Windows, press the PrtSc key, then start 
Paint and paste the screenshot into the Paint window. On 
a Mac, use Command-Shift-3. Use the File tab to save 
your screenshot with the file name Unit3XtraLab followed 
by your name.

Web Overview
The Web is not the Internet. Just as cellular towers are different from the text 
messages you send over them, the Internet is different from the Web. The 
Internet is a global data communications network. The Web is just one of 
many technologies that use the Internet to distribute data. 
	What are the key elements of Web technology? The World 
Wide Web (usually referred to simply as the Web) is a collection of HTML 
documents, images, videos, and sound files that can be linked to each other 
and accessed over the Internet using a protocol called HTTP. 
The Web is accessed from desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smart-
phones using software commonly called a browser. A Web browser is client 
software that displays Web page elements and handles links between those 
pages. Popular browsers include Microsoft Internet Explorer, open-source 
Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari. Figure 4-1 lists the essen-
tial Web technologies that you’ll learn about in this unit.

Terminology
The process of accessing a Web 
site is sometimes referred to as 
surfing the Web and visitors are 
called Web surfers.

Evolution
According to MIT researcher Matthew Gray, in June 1993 there were a total 
of 130 Web sites containing linked documents. By January 1996, there were 
100,000 Web sites. Today, there are more than a billion Web sites and new 
sites appear every day. The remarkable story of such explosive growth 
began more than half a century ago.
	How did the Web evolve? In 1945, an engineer named Vannevar 
Bush described a microfilm-based machine called the Memex that linked 
associated information or ideas through “trails.” By following trails from one 
document to another, readers could track down ideas from within an exten-
sive library of information. Bush’s Memex was hypothetical, however; the 
microfilm readers and analog computers of the time were not suitable for 
such a complex task. 
The idea of linked documents resurfaced in the mid-1960s when Harvard 
graduate Ted Nelson coined the term hypertext to describe a computer 
system that could store literary documents, link them according to logical 
relationships, and allow readers to comment and annotate what they read. 
Nelson sketched the diagram in Figure 4-2 to explain his idea of a computer-
based “web” of “links.”

Fast-forward to 1990 when a British scientist named Tim Berners-Lee 
developed specifications for URLs, HTML, and HTTP—the foundation tech-
nologies of today’s Web. Berners-Lee also created Web browser software 
originally called WorldWideWeb but later renamed Nexus (Figure 4-3).
Nexus ran on NeXT computers and was not available to the huge installed 
base of IBM PCs. In 1993, Marc Andreessen and his colleagues at the 
University of Illinois created Mosaic, a browser that ran on several com-
puting platforms, including Windows. Andreessen later formed his own 
company and produced a browser called Netscape (Figure 4-4), which put 
the Web into the hands of millions of Web surfers. 
Figure 4-3: The first Web Browser 
Figure 4-4: The browser that popularized the Web
Netscape Navigator was the first browser in widespread use. Can you recognize 
elements of the Netscape window that are similar to elements of the browser 
you use today?

SECTION A, UNIT 4
Web sites
Web sites are the cyberspace equivalent of shops and offices in a city’s com-
mercial district. A home page serves as the Web site’s doorway and links to 
all the Web pages that the site offers. 
	What is a Web site? A Web site typically contains a collection of 
related information organized and formatted so it can be accessed using a 
browser. 
You are probably familiar with informational Web sites such as 
HowStuffWorks, CNN.com, ESPN.com, and Wikipedia. Web sites can 
also offer Web-based applications, such as Google Docs, and social net-
working, such as Facebook. Another popular category of Web sites hosts 
ecommerce stores such as Amazon.com, eBay, and Etsy. 
The activities that take place at Web sites are under the control of Web 
servers. A Web server is an Internet-based computer that stores Web site 
content and accepts requests from browsers. One server can host multiple 
Web sites, and some Web sites are spread across multiple servers.
	What is a Web page? A Web page is based on an HTML source 
document that is stored as a file on a Web server. The source document 
contains the text for a Web page interspersed with coding for how to dis-
play text and any additional visual or auditory elements. 
The content of Web pages can incorporate text, images, videos, and sound 
files, as well as elements pulled on the fly from databases (Figure 4-5).

Hypertext links
Most of us have used the Web so much that we’ve become conditioned 
to the way it works. We rarely stop to consider how it might be improved. 
But the way hypertext links function might have been quite different if Ted 
Nelson’s vision of the Web had come to fruition.
	What are hypertext links? Web pages are connected by hyper-
text links (commonly referred to simply as links). For example, a syllabus 
can contain links to other documents, such as to lecture notes or to an 
assigned reading. 
Links are commonly indicated by underlined or colored text, but a photo, 
button, tab, or other object on a Web page can act as the source of a link. 
On conventional screens, the mouse pointer changes to a hand when it 
rolls over a link (Figure 4-6). On touchscreens, users often have to experi-
ment with tapping and swiping to discover links. 
Figure 4-6: Finding the Links
When using a mouse, hovering 
over objects may display pull-
down lists or pop-up boxes.
Images, photos, and logos 
may be links.
Arrows are usually links, but 
they might lead to ads, so be 
careful!
Colored text 
is often a link.
Underlined text is the traditional 
treatment used for links.

SECTION A, UNIT 4
	How do links work? In today’s Web, Web pages have unidirec-
tional links—so Document A links to Document B, but not vice versa. 
Unidirectional links were a key factor in simplifying early Web prototypes 
so that they could be feasibly implemented. However, this type of link lim-
its the ability to trace back to related material.
Bidirectional links connect two documents using a two-way link that can 
be followed from either document. Designs with bidirectional links, such 
as Ted Nelson’s Project Xanadu, were too complex to successfully con-
struct. Figure 4-7 illustrates the difference between unidirectional links 
and bidirectional links.
Figure 4-7: Unidirectional and bidirectional links
Document A contains a link to 
Document B. When reading 
Document A, you can easily 
follow the link to the related 
material in Document B.
A
B

But the link from Document 
A to Document B is unidirec-
tional. When you are reading 
Document B, there is no link 
to Document, A and you may 
never find that related material.

Bidirectional links would establish 
links from A to B and from B to A. 
Regardless of which document you 
viewed first, a link would exist to 
the other document.

URLs
URLs identify Web sites and Web pages. They offer clues about what pages 
contain. Or do they? URLs can be long and complex. They can also be 
shortened to disguise what they contain. The security of your digital devices 
may depend on your understanding of URLs and their components.
	What are the components of a URL? Every Web page has a 
unique address called a URL (Uniform Resource Locator, pronounced “you 
are ELL”). For example, the URL for the Cable News Network (CNN) Web 
site is http://www.cnn.com. Most URLs begin with http:// to indicate the 
Web’s standard communications ­protocol. 
The pages for a Web site are stored in folders on the Web server. The 
names of folders and subfolders that hold a Web page are reflected in the 
URL. For example, the CNN site might store ­entertainment news stories in 
a folder called Showbiz. The URL for that folder would be http://www.cnn.
com/showbiz/. 
The file name of a ­specific Web page always appears last in the URL. Web 
page files usually have an .htm or .html extension, indicating that the page 
was created with Hypertext Markup Language. The main page for a Web 
site is usually called Index.htm. Figure 4-8 identifies the parts of a URL.

Figure 4-9: A URL can contain a Query string 
URLs can include

	Do all URLs reference pages? Some URLs contain a search string 
rather than the name of an HTML document. Suppose you are at the CNN 
site and want to find the latest sports news. Entering Sports in the search 
box produces an address that includes a question mark and a query string. 
The Web page that’s displayed is a result of the search (Figure 4-9).

SECTION A, UNIT 4
	What are the rules for correctly typing a URL? When typing 
URLs in the browser address box, there are a few rules to remember:
• A URL never contains spaces, even after a punctuation mark, so do not 
type any spaces within a URL. An underline symbol is sometimes used to 
give the appearance of a space between words in a file name—for exam-
ple, www.detroit.com/top_10.html. 
• When typing a URL, the http:// can be omitted, so www.cnn.com works just 
as well as http://www.cnn.com.
• Be sure to use the correct type of slash—always a forward slash (/).
• Duplicate the URL’s capitalization exactly. Some Web servers are case 
sensitive. On these servers, typing www.cmu.edu/Info.html (with an upper-
case I) will not locate the Web page that’s stored on the Web server as 
www.cmu.edu/info.html (with a lowercase i).
	Are links URLs? No, but a link contains the URL that links to another 
Web page. Before linking to a page, for security reasons, you might want to 
preview the URL for the page. Figure 4-10 shows how.
Figure 4-10: Look Before You Click
When using a mouse, hovering over a link displays a link preview that indicates 
where the link leads. This feature is not available when using a touchscreen, 
because there is no way for the screen to sense when your finger is hovering 
over a link but is not touching the screen.

	How are URLs related to domain names? URLs contain a domain 
name. For example, the URL http://www.nike.com/fitness contains the 
domain name nike.com. Some domain names contain the name of the busi-
ness or organization that operates the Web site. But many domain names 
and Web site URLs provide no indication of a site’s real owner. To discover 
that information, you can use a WHOIS search as explained in Unit 3. 
	Can I manipulate URLs? When you click a link, your browser links to 
the URL and displays the associated Web page. Sometimes links lead to 
pages that are no longer available, a situation known as linkrot. Links that 
no longer work are called broken links or dead links. If you reach a dead 
link, you can sometimes manipulate the URL to locate similar material that 
remains on the Web site. Figure 4-11 illustrates the technique.
Figure 4-11: Getting past Linkrot

www.bleacherreport.com/articles/nfl/injuries/ 
When a Web page no longer exists at the specified URL, edit the link in the 
address box by backtracking to the first slash. Press the Enter key. The modi-
fied link may take you to a list of content similar to the original link. 
You can also experiment with changing words or numbers in a URL—a technique 
that often works for locating materials for a different date or page number.

SECTION A, UNIT 4
	Why are URLs so long? When visiting Web sites, glance at the 
address bar from time to time. Many of the URLs are long and complex. 
Here’s a long URL that’s the Web page for a short story:
http://www.edisonjones.com/short-stories-for-kids-edison-jones/stories-for-
kids-samuel-and-the-pirates.html
	Is there any way to shorten URLs? Long URLs can be a prob-
lem. The longer they are, the easier it is to make a typing error. Also, long 
URLs consume too many characters in short messaging applications such 
as Twitter.
Several services, such as Bitly and Goo.gl, create short URLs. Anyone can 
request a short URL by entering the normal URL at one of these services. 
The service will generate a short URL. The original URL and the short URL 
are stored in a translation table on the service’s server. Figure 4-12 illus-
trates how short URLs work.

	Do short URLs expire? Short URL services may lead consumers to 
believe that the short URLs will last forever, but they last only as long as 
the service maintains its servers. If a service ceases operations, the short 
URLs maintained on its servers will no longer work. 
Short URLs are sometimes used to disguise the real address of a Web site 
that is illegitimate. This practice has resulted in short URL services being 
blocked by Web hosts and ISPs. When URL services are blocked, the short 
URLs on their servers will not work. 
Web surfers should be aware that short URLs may lead to questionable 
Web sites and scams. As shown in Figure 4-13, several sites, such as 
LongURL, provide ways to check the actual destination of a shortened URL 
before you click it.

Browser Basics
Web browsers are the all-purpose tool for accessing the Web and every-
thing it has to offer. They are used on all personal computer platforms. 
What’s surprising is that the essential elements of browsers for small 
screen devices, such as smartphones, are so similar to those for large 
screen devices, such as desktops and laptops.
	What’s in the standard browser window? The essential ele-
ments of a browser include an entry area for URLs and searches, navigation 
controls to move from one page to another, a refresh button, a home but-
ton, a settings menu, and a display area for Web page content. Additional 
elements, such as tabs, facilitate the browsing experience. Figure 4-14 
illustrates essential browser elements and several additional features com-
mon to browsers on full-screen and mobile devices.

	What are the most popular browsers? Today’s popular browsers 
are Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Mozilla 
Firefox. In Figure 4-15, compare the placement and design of the address 
bars and navigation controls of these popular browsers.
Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) is 
included with the Windows operating 
system. According to Wikimedia traffic 
reports, IE accounts for about 20% of 
the browsing activity that takes place 
on the Web.
Mozilla Firefox is a descendant 
of the first graphical browser, 
Netscape Navigator. As open 
source software, Firefox is avail-
able for free and is easy to 
download and install. Firefox 
accounts for about 12% of Web 
traffic.
Google Chrome is one of the most 
recently developed browsers, but it 
accounts for about 45% of desktop 
and mobile Web traffic. Known for 
its streamlined design and billed 
for its speed and security, Chrome 
is free and available from Google’s 
Web site.
Apple Safari is shipped with iOS 
devices. About 20% of desktop 
and mobile traffic on the Web is 
generated by individuals using 
Safari.

	When should I upgrade my browser? It is a good idea to upgrade 
when a new version of your browser becomes available. Because most 
browser updates are free, you can get up-to-date ­functionality simply by 
spending a few minutes downloading and installing an update.
The most important reason to upgrade is for increased security. As hack-
ers discover and take advantage of security holes, browser publishers try 
to patch the holes. Upgrades normally contain patches for known security 
exploits, although new features might sometimes open new holes.
New versions of browsers also reflect changes in operating systems and 
specifications for the HTML used to create Web pages. To take advantage 
of the latest innovations and to experience Web pages with all the bells and 
whistles intended by their designers, an updated browser is recommended. 
	Is it possible to use multiple browsers? It is allowable to have 
more than one browser installed on a device, and you can open any 
installed browser and use it to surf the Web. Only one browser can be des-
ignated as the default browser, which is automatically used, for example, 
when you click a link in an email message or PDF file. 
You can add browsers and change which browser is used as the default. 
Suppose that your device is equipped with Internet Explorer, but you’d pre-
fer to use Chrome or Firefox. There is no need to delete Internet Explorer. 
Simply download and install Google Chrome or Firefox, then set it as your 
default browser using one of the methods shown in Figure 4-16.

Method 1 continued: 
Select the browser

SECTION B, UNIT 4
Customization
Stop for a moment and think about how many hours a day you spend using 
a browser for research, entertainment, and communication. Why settle for 
a plain vanilla interface when you can streamline your Web experience by 
customizing your browser? You can change your home page, customize 
bookmarks and favorites, control tab behavior, select predictive services, 
and adjust password settings. 
	What should I set as my home page? The browser home page 
is the first page displayed when the browser starts. Set the home page to a 
site that works as a doorway to your Web world. If your primary use of the 
Web is seeking information, then a search engine site, such as Google, 
makes a good home page. If you prefer to land amidst your online friends, 
then Facebook makes a good home page. If you’re a newshound, point 
your home page to Google News, CNN, or Fox News. You can also use ser-
vices such as Start.me, My Yahoo, or uStart to design your own start page 
like the one in Figure 4-17.
	What about predictive services? Predictive services look ahead 
and anticipate what you might do when searching or filling out forms. In IE, 
predictive services are referred to as AutoComplete, whereas in Safari and 
Firefox, they are called suggestions. These services can automatically fill 
in form data based on entries you’ve made to earlier forms, and they can 
complete your search requests based on previous searches. Predictive 
services may track your actions and store data about you online. If you 
are nervous about privacy intrusions, then you might want to disable these 
services.

	How do I customize bookmarks and favorites? Bookmarks (or 
Favorites, as they are called in IE) link to pages that you use frequently. 
When the browser is configured to show bookmarks, they appear on the 
browser toolbar and are easy to access. 
Consider creating bookmarks to your favorite social networking and infor-
mational sites. Set a bookmark to your favorite music service, or create a 
bookmark to quickly check the caloric content of the food you eat. Perhaps 
a bookmark to an online thesaurus can help improve your writing (Figure 
4-18). One caution: Create bookmarks for sites that help, not hinder. That 
addictive cat video site? Don’t bookmark it if the site becomes a distraction. 
	Can I control tabs? Browser tabs allow your browser to queue up 
multiple Web pages so that you can easily switch between them. Your 
browser’s Settings menu allows you to specify whether to use tabs or a 
new browser window. Each tab holds a page, and simply clicking the tab 
displays the corresponding page. 
An alternative to tabs is opening new pages in separate browser windows—
a process that allows you to see multiple pages at the same time, rather 
than switching among them (Figure 4-19).

SECTION B, UNIT 4
	Is it safe to allow my browser to store passwords? Browsers 
ask to save passwords when you log in to sites. If you agree, your password 
is stored in an encrypted file on your local device. The next time you log in to 
a site, your browser will use the corresponding stored password.
Storing passwords is a useful feature. You can create unique and hard-to-
guess passwords without fear that you might forget them and without the 
hassle of looking them up each time you log in.
The potential risk of stored passwords is that anyone who gains access to 
your device can easily log in to your password protected sites because the 
passwords are supplied by your browser. If you allow your browser to store 
passwords, be sure to use a password to protect access to your device. 
You can discover which passwords are saved by the browsers you use. To 
view passwords stored by Internet Explorer, go to Control Panel and select 
Credential Manager. For Safari, select the Preferences menu, then select 
the Passwords tab. In Firefox, open the Security panel and select Saved 
Passwords. Figure 4-20 illustrates how to find passwords stored by Chrome.

Browser Cache
Browsers pull HTML documents, images, and other Web page elements 
to your local device—and not just the main elements of a page. All those 
funky ads are pulled down, too. It is somewhat troubling that these ele-
ments may remain in a Web cache on your device, leaving a trail of 
digital bread crumbs to the Web sites you’ve visited.
	What is a browser cache? When your browser fetches pages and 
graphics to form a Web page, it stores that material on your device in 
temporary files referred to as a browser cache, Web cache, or browser 
history. 
A browser cache comes in handy if you switch back and forth between 
pages or sites. Rather than fetch the entire page and all its graphics 
again, your browser can simply load them from the local cache (Figure 
4-21). 
	How does a browser cache affect my privacy and security? 
Files can remain in the Web cache for days or weeks, depending on your 
browser’s settings. Because a browser cache stores Web page elements 
from all the sites you’ve visited, anyone with access to your device can view 
this trail of Web sites. In addition, when you use a public or lab computer, 
the next person who uses the computer may be able to see the cache of 
your Web activity. 
Figure 4-21: Your Browser Cache in Action
QuickCheck
Which of the following would 
you not expect to find in a 
browser cache?
a.	 Passwords
b.	 Image files from Web pages
c.	 Images from ads
d.	 HTML documents
When a Web page is 
first accessed, all the 
elements are download-
ed and stored locally in 
the browser cache be-
fore they are displayed 
on the screen.
If you return to the 
Web site in a later ses-
sion, your browser first 
checks the cache. Any 
elements that are stored 
locally do not have to be 
downloaded again.

SECTION B, UNIT 4
	Can I see what’s in a browser cache? Yes. With some browsers, 
such as Google Chrome, it is easy to see a listing of files in the browser 
cache and even retrieve them. So, if you want to access a photo that you 
saw during a previous browsing session but can’t get back to the site, you 
may be able to access the photo from the browser cache. 
The steps for viewing files in the browser cache depend on the browser 
you’re using. It is also worth mentioning that if you use more than one 
browser, each one has a separate cache. Figure 4-22 illustrates how to 
access files stored in Chrome’s cache. 
	Is it possible to clear out the browser cache? Browsers include 
settings for limiting the time cached files remain on your device, limiting the 
amount of space they can use on the hard disk, and deleting all the cached 
files. Figure 4-23 illustrates how to delete the cache when using Google 
Chrome.
Figure 4-22: What’s in Your Browser Cache?

	But what about the History list? Good point. In addition to the 
cache, your browser maintains a History list of sites that you’ve visited. 
This list may include unsavory Web sites that you inadvertently linked to but 
wished you hadn’t. You can delete the History list, usually using a process 
similar to the one used to clear the browser cache.
Today’s browsers also offer private browsing modes, in which traces of 
your activity are not maintained in the History list or browser cache. Internet 
Explorer calls this mode InPrivate Browsing. Google Chrome calls it incog-
nito mode. In Safari and Firefox, it is called Private Browsing. 
Although private browsing accumulates no trail of Web activity on your local 
device, it does not prevent external sources, such as advertisers and gov-
ernment snoopers, from tracking your activity. Use private browsing when 
you prefer not to leave a trail that can be seen by others who gain access to 
a device that you have recently used. Figure 4-24 demonstrates how easy 
it is to enter incognito mode in Google Chrome.
Figure 4-24: Go Incognito!
From the Customization 
menu, select New incog-

Google Chrome displays 
the incognito home 
screen.
As long as the incog-
nito icon appears in the 
upper-left corner of the 
browser window, incog-

effect. When you close 
the incognito tabs, all 
traces of the sites you 
visited will be deleted.

SECTION B, UNIT 4
Plugins and Extensions
It is a nuisance when you click a link at a Web site only to see a message 
such as, “This page requires a more recent version of Silverlight.” Before you 
can enjoy that video clip, you’ve got to spend time downloading some kind of 
software update. The process can be a hassle, and you might wonder why it 
is necessary.
	Why do I have to download software to view some Web 
pages? Browsers were originally limited to displaying documents in HTML 
­format and displaying graphics files in GIF and JPEG formats. Today, how-
ever, many additional formats are used for graphics, sound, and video 
included in Web pages. Browsers do not have built-in support for all these 
formats. The software your browser calls upon to work with additional file 
formats is referred to as a plugin.
	What is a plugin? A plugin is a program that extends a browser’s abil-
ity to work with file formats. Most plugins can be downloaded from the Web. 
Plugins come in different versions for different browsers. When looking for 
plugins, let your browser do the searching and it will find the correct version.
Popular plugins include Adobe Reader for viewing PDF files, and Adobe 
Flash Player, QuickTime Player, and Microsoft Silverlight for playing 
animations and videos. Java is another popular plugin that runs small pro-
grams called applets, which add interactivity to Web pages.
	How do I install plugins? Plugins are available online. Usually, a 
download button copies the plugin to your local device, then you can follow 
the instructions to install it. 
The process of installing a plugin creates an association between the 
browser and a file format, such as PDF, SWF, or MOV. Whenever your 
browser encounters one of these file formats, it automatically runs the cor-
responding plugin, which in turn opens the file. 
	How do I manage plugins? You can view, disable, and delete plugins. 
In Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, plugins are managed from the browser. In 
Internet Explorer, plugins are managed along with other installed software 
through the Control Panel. Figure 4-25 provides a guide so that you can find 
them in the browser that you use.

	What is an extension? A browser extension adds features to a 
browser. Although extensions might seem to be the same as plugins, they 
are different. A plugin helps a browser display or play content, whereas an 
extension gives the browser itself more features and functionality. For exam-
ple, one very popular extension called AdBlock removes advertisements 
from Web pages. Other extensions add various toolbars to the browser 
window; the Google toolbar, the Merriam-Webster Online Toolbar, and the 
Stumble Upon toolbar are popular.
Even more extensions include a grammar checker to proofread your social 
media posts, a URL shortener for adding links to Twitter, and encryption that 
protects the data passing between your device and Web servers. There are 
even extensions that detect and display cookies and other devices that track 
your activity on the Web.
	How do I manage extensions? Browsers provide a list of installed 
extensions and provide tools for disabling, enabling, or deleting them as 
shown in Figure 4-26.

HTML
The language of the Web is 
HTML. It determines the text, images, and sounds 
that become part of a Web page, and specifies 
exactly how those elements are displayed. It also 
explains why some Web pages look kind of funky 
in one browser but picture perfect in others. The 
language of the Web, it seems, is open to interpre-
tation.

HTML BASICS
HTML is the foundation for professionally designed corporate Web sites, 
but a little knowledge of HTML can come in handy for your everyday inter-
actions online. You can use HTML tags to add standout notes on your 
Facebook profile page. HTML is also useful for enhancing blog posts and 
comments.
	What should I know about HTML? Tim Berners-Lee developed 
the original HTML specifications in 1990. These specifications have been 
revised several times by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The cur-
rent version, HTML5, was introduced in 2010.
HTML is a set of specifications for creating documents that a browser can 
display as a Web page. HTML is called a markup language because 
authors mark up documents by inserting special instructions called HTML 
tags that specify how the document should appear when displayed in a 
browser window.
HTML is a member of a family of markup languages. You may see refer-
ences to these languages as you work with Web site design. Figure 4-27 
summarizes the family tree.
HTML (Hypertext Markup 
Language) The standard markup 
language for specifying how 
browsers display Web pages
	How do HTML tags work? HTML tags are incorporated into an 
HTML document, which is similar to a word processing file but has an 
.htm or .html extension. HTML tags, such as <h1> and <p>, are enclosed in 
angle brackets and embedded in the document. The <h1> tag specifies a 
heading; the <p> indicates a new paragraph.
Most tags are inserted as pairs. The start tag and end tag enclose the con-
tent like this:
<h1> THE GLOBAL CHEF </h1>
HTML tags are instructions for the browser. When your browser displays 
a Web page on your computer screen, it does not show the tags or angle 
brackets. Instead, it attempts to follow the tags’ instructions. The Global 
Chef heading might appear in the browser like this:
THE GLOBAL CHEF
Figure 4-27: Markup Language Family Tree
QuickCheck
The HTML tag <h1> specifies 
_____________.
a.	 the style of text used as 
headings
b.	 the title of an HTML page
c.	 the beginning of an HTML 
document
d.	 the format for images
XHTML (Extensible HTML) A 
markup language that is very simi-
lar to HTML but is stricter about 
punctuation and other details 
of the coding; most Web site 
designers actually use XHTML, but 
everyone just calls it HTML
DHTML (Dynamic HTML) 
A collection of technologies 
used with HTML to create 
interactive Web sites
XML (Extensible Markup 
Language) A language designed 
to describe data; for example, 
think of the data in a phone 
book with each entry marked 
up to indicate <person> Joe 
Smith <phone> 236-1123
SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) 
A standard or template for markup languages; a lan-
guage for writing markup languages

SECTION C, UNIT 4
	So HTML documents look a lot different from Web pages, 
right? Exactly. An HTML document is like a screenplay, and your browser 
is like a director who makes a screenplay come to life by assembling cast 
members and making sure they deliver their lines correctly. 
As the HTML “screenplay” unfolds, your browser follows the instructions in 
an HTML document to display lines of text on the screen in the right color, 
size, and position. 
If the screenplay calls for a graphic, your browser collects it from the Web 
server and displays it. Although the HTML screenplay exists as a perma-
nent file, the Web page you see on the screen exists only for the duration of 
the “performance.” 
An HTML document is sometimes referred to as a source document 
because it is the source of the HTML tags used to construct a Web page. 
Figure 4-28 illustrates the difference between an HTML source document 
(bottom) and the Web page it produces (top).

HTML Editing Tools
There is an extensive toolset available for creating Web pages. Once you’re 
aware of the options, you can select the tools that best suit your project and 
your ability as a designer.
	What tools are available for creating Web pages? You can 
create files for Web pages with an HTML conversion utility, online HTML 
editor, local HTML editor, or text editor. 
HTML conversion utility. An HTML conversion utility creates an 
HTML document from a conventional document, spreadsheet, or other 
text-based file. For example, you can work with Microsoft Word to create 
a standard DOCX file, and then use Word’s Save As Web Page option to 
convert the document into HTML format. The HTML conversion process 
occasionally produces an unusual result, however, because some of the 
features and formatting in your original document might not be possible 
within the world of HTML. 
Online HTML editor. A second option for Web page authors is to use 
an online HTML editor. These template-like tools are provided by most 
Web hosting companies. Working with these tools is quite simple—you 
select a template, choose a color scheme, enter titles and other text, 
upload graphics, and add links to other pages (Figure 4-29). 
Figure 4-29: Using Google Sites to Create Web Pages
Locally installed HTML editor. Two more options for creating Web 
pages include local HTML editors and comprehensive Web development 
software. Some of these tools offer professional features for managing 
extensive corporate Web sites, while others are geared toward creating 
smaller personal sites. Popular Web development products include Adobe 
Dreamweaver, and open source KompoZer and Amaya.
Text editor. HTML documents can be created with a basic ASCII text edi-
tor, such as Notepad or TextEdit. With these tools, you start from scratch, 
with a blank page, and enter HTML codes along with the text that you want 
to include in the Web page. Although Web designers rarely use these tools 
to create entire Web sites, text editors can be useful for troubleshooting 
HTML documents. Text editors also offer a great way to learn HTML basics 
that you can apply to format online comments and posts.
Online HTML 
editors provide for-
matting tools and 
entry areas for text 
and graphics.

	What are the parts of an HTML document? The framework for 
an HTML document consists of two sections: the head and the body. The 
head section begins with <!DOCTYPE html> and <head> tags. It may 
also include information that defines global properties, including the Web 
page title that appears in the browser title bar and information about the 
page that can be used by search engines.
The body section of an HTML document begins with the <body> HTML 
tag. This section of the document contains text, HTML tags that format 
the text, plus a variety of links to graphics, sounds, and videos. Figure 
4-30 contains basic HTML for a Web page. You can use it as a template 
for creating your own pages.

also specify the images you want to appear on the page, and you can cre-
ate clickable links to other Web pages. The table in Figure 4-31 provides a 
list of basic tags that you can use to create your own HTML documents.

	Which HTML tags can be used in blog posts and comments? 
Many blogs and social media sites accept comments from readers. You 
might be able to include HTML tags in your comments to enhance text 
and even add images. 
Commonly, you can use <b> and <i> tags to set text in bold or italics. The 
<a href> tag may also be allowed for linking to a Web site. To discover if 
HTML tags are allowed in a specific online venue, check its Help link or 
Google a query such as Goodreads HTML as shown in Figure 4-32.

SECTION C, UNIT 4
CSS
A Web page displayed in a browser may look simple. The page might 
contain some blocks of text, a handful of photos, some text links, and a 
few navigation buttons. With your knowledge of HTML, you can probably 
envision the source document for such a page. But that document is usu-
ally accompanied by CSS. What’s that all about?
	What is CSS? CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a set 
of detailed style specifications for an HTML document. These specifications 
are called style rules, which include settings for font colors, font sizes, 
background colors, borders, text alignment, link formats, and margins. 
There are three types of style sheets:
Inline. Style sheets can be intermixed within an HTML document, but the 
use of an inline CSS is avoided by professional designers. 
Internal. An internal CSS is included within the header of an HTML docu-
ment. It places all the formatting elements where they can be edited without 
hunting through the entire document.
External. With an external CSS, style rules are placed in a separate file 
with a .css extension. CSS files can be manually created with a text editor. 
HTML editors generally create external CSSs automatically. For Web sites 
with more than one page, an external CSS is the recommended approach. 
The advantage of external style sheets is that all of the pages for a Web 
site can be controlled by a single style sheet. If you decide, for example, to 
change the color of the heading font, you make only one change to the style 
sheet and it will be applied to every page on the site.
	What does a style rule look like? CSS style rules have a selector 
and a declaration block. The selector indicates an HTML element to which 
you want to apply a style rule. The declaration specifies the styles. Here is a 
style rule for displaying Heading 1 text in purple 10 point font. 
h1    {color: purple; font-size: 10 px;}
A CSS containing several styles for a Web site might look like Figure 4-33.
body 
{
font-family: arial; }
h1 {
    color: purple; text-align: center;}
a:link {
    color: purple; }

	How does external CSS work? Let’s suppose you have a Web site 
containing five pages. You have five HTML documents—one for each page. 
At the top of each page is the heading, “THE GLOBAL CHEF.” You want the 
browser to display that text in purple and centered in the browser window. 
Figure 4-34 illustrates how to link the CSS to the five Web pages.
Create a CSS called SiteStyle.css and 
define the h1 style like this:
h1 {color: purple; text-align: center;}

Dynamic Web Pages
Using HTML and CSS, Web designers can create a static Web page that 
displays the same information, regardless of who accesses it. The page 
will have the same content and format for all visitors. In your experience, 
however, Web sites can display customized pages that show products 
you’re shopping for, tunes from your favorite musicians, and driving 
directions for your next road trip. These dynamic Web pages require an 
additional layer of technology.
	How do Web pages become dynamic? A dynamic Web page 
displays customized content in response to keyboard or mouse actions, or 
based on information supplied directly or indirectly by the person viewing the 
page. Information is supplied directly when a Web site visitor searches for a 
product, for example, or asks for driving directions. Information is supplied 
indirectly when a Web page can autonomously grab data based on the visi-
tor’s location or browsing history. 
Dynamic elements can be incorporated in Web pages with the addition 
of instructions, called scripts, written with scripting languages, such as 
JavaScript, PHP, and Python. These scripts can be incorporated into the 
<head> or <body> sections of an HTML document, or in a separate doc-
ument. There are two ways to script dynamic Web pages: client-side and 
server-side. 
	When do Web designers use client-side dynamics? Client-side 
scripts are embedded in an HTML document and run locally when a Web 
page is displayed by a browser. Client-side dynamics are used to customize 
aspects of the user interface and for simple interactions.
A classic example of a client-side script is changing the appearance of a 
graphical object displayed on a Web page (Figure 4-35). 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<script>
function changeImage() {
    var image=document.  
    getElementById('myImage');
    if (image.src.match("bulbon")) {
        image.src="pic_bulboff.gif"; }
    else {
        image.src="pic_bulbon.gif";    }}
</script>
<img id="myImage" onclick="changeImage()" 
src="pic_bulboff.gif" width="100" height="180">
<p>Click the light bulb to turn on/off the light</p>
</body>
</html>
Figure 4-35: Client-side Script changes the image when clicked
Clicking or tapping the lightbulb image...
...runs the script to change the image.

	When do Web designers use server-side dynamics? Server-side 
scripts run on Web servers rather than on your local device. The server 
typically accesses information from a database and uses that information to 
create customized Web pages on the fly.
A common use of server-side scripting is online shopping. Figure 4-36 illus-
trates how an online store uses server-side scripts to display a customized 
list of products when you search for Mountain Bikes.

SECTION C, UNIT 4
SITE CREATION 
Whether you work with a text editor or another authoring tool, HTML doc-
uments should be saved in files with .htm or .html extensions. Creating a 
Web page is not the end of the publishing process. The steps for estab-
lishing a Web site include selecting a hosting service, choosing a domain, 
posting Web pages, and testing pages in various browsers.
	What is a hosting service? Getting a Web site up and running is 
easy and inexpensive. You need a hosting service, a URL, and a set of 
Web pages for your site.
A Web hosting service is a company that provides space on a server 
to house Web pages. Web hosting services such as GoDaddy, Amazon 
Web Services, HostGator, and Google offer a variety of hosting plans. 
Figure 4-37 illustrates the types of plans available from a typical hosting 
service.
	What are the choices for URLs? The URL for your Web site 
depends on its domain. You can obtain your own domain name, such 
as MyOwnWebSite.com, and then your site can be accessed using the 
URL www.MyOwnWebSite.com. Once you have your own domain name, 
you can use it with any hosting service. Another option is to use a sub-
domain of your hosting service. For example, a Web site created with 
Google Sites could use Google’s domain name combined with a name 
that you choose for your site—for example, sites.google.com/site/
MyOwnWebSite.
	How do I post pages? When pages are created locally using a text 
editor or local HTML editor, those pages must be uploaded to your host-
ing service. A mechanism for doing so is usually provided by your hosting 
service. If not, you can use FTP to upload files. 
Pages that are created online using tools from your hosting service just 
need to be “published,” which specifies that they become publicly acces-
sible.

	What does testing involve? Basic Web page testing involves try-
ing every text link to make sure that it leads to the intended destination. 
In addition, it is important to test every navigation link to ensure that visi-
tors can easily reach every page of your site.
It is an unfortunate fact that today’s browsers are not completely stan-
dardized. They render some HTML tags differently. Effects that work on 
some browsers may look and behave very differently on others. 
An additional problem involving fonts can affect how pages are displayed. 
A browser generally uses the fonts installed on the local device when dis-
playing Web pages. Suppose our example Web site, The Global Chef, 
uses an unusual font such as American Typewriter. When its pages are 
displayed on devices without the American Typewriter font, a substitute 
font will be used; that font might make the page look quite different from 
the intended design (Figure 4-38).
To uncover problems that might be caused by browser compatibility, 
careful designers test new and revised sites using each one of the popu-
lar browsers.
This page was designed on a computer with 
American Typewriter font installed (top). But on a 
computer without that font (right), the title is not 
displayed as the designer intended.

Http Basics
You can think of HTTP as the system that browsers use to communicate 
with a Web server and ask for HTML documents. HTTP is responsible for 
transporting Web pages, whereas HTML is responsible for the way Web 
pages look when displayed by a browser.
	How does HTTP work? HTTP is a communication protocol that 
works with TCP/IP to get the elements for Web pages to a local browser. A 
set of commands called HTTP methods help your browser communicate 
with Web servers. 
GET is the most frequently used HTTP method. GET is used to retrieve 
text and image files necessary for displaying a Web page. GET can also be 
used to pass a search query to a Web server (Figure 4-39). 
The set of methods for HTTP is not very large. As with many aspects of 
the digital world, amazingly complex activities are carried out by seem-
ingly simple elements. The other most commonly used HTTP methods 
are listed in Figure 4-40.
METHOD

GET 
Requests data from a specified source

SECTION D, UNIT 4
	What is an HTTP session? HTTP uses port 80 for communications 
between a client device and a server. The exchange takes place within a 
session. An HTTP session is a sequence of transactions most commonly 
used to request data from a Web server and return the files needed to dis-
play a Web page in a browser window. 
At the end of a session, the connection is closed. Because the server does 
not “remember” its state from one session to the next, HTTP is called a 
stateless protocol. Figure 4-41 illustrates typical HTTP sessions.
	What if an element cannot be found? A Web server’s response to 
a browser’s request includes an HTTP status code that indicates whether 
the browser’s request could be fulfilled. The status code 200 means that 
the request was fulfilled—the requested HTML document, graphic, or other 
resource was sent. 
Anyone who surfs the Web has encountered the “404 Not Found” message. 
Your browser displays this message when a Web server sends a 404 status 
code to indicate that the requested resource does not exist (Figure 4-42).

Cookies
Cookies—the kind associated with the Web—have a bad reputation. They 
are affiliated with marketing exploits that track your browsing behavior by 
recording products you’ve viewed, merchandise you’ve purchased, and 
Web sites you’ve visited. You can take control of cookies once you under-
stand why they are used and how they work.
	What is a cookie? A cookie (technically an HTTP cookie) is a small 
chunk of data generated by a Web server and stored as a text file in mem-
ory or on disk. Cookies can be stored on any devices—desktop computers, 
laptops, tablets, or smartphones—on which you use a browser. 
Cookies allow a Web site to store information on a client device for later 
retrieval. Web sites use cookies to:
• Monitor your path through a site to keep track of the pages you viewed or 
the items you purchased. 
• Gather information that allows a Web server to present ad banners ­targeted 
to products you previously purchased at that Web site. 
• Collect personal information you submit to a Web page, and retain it for the 
next time you visit the Web site.
• Verify that you have logged in to a site using a valid user ID and password, 
if necessary.
	Why do Web sites need to use cookies? In many respects, cook-
ies are the solution for problems caused by HTTP’s stateless protocol, 
which maintains no record of the pages you visit at a Web site. 
Suppose that you use your browser to visit a popular online music store. 
You search for your favorite bands, listen to some sample tracks, and put 
a few albums in your shopping cart. Because HTTP is a stateless proto-
col, each time you ­connect to a different Web page at the site, the server 
regards it as a new visit. Therefore, HTTP by itself cannot record your path 
through a Web site. Cookies, however, enable the server to keep track of 
your activity and compile a list of your purchases.
	What’s in a cookie? A cookie can contain any information that’s 
collected by the host site, such as a customer number, Web page URL, 
shopping cart number, or access date. It may also contain an ID number 
that is assigned by the server or by a JavaScript. Figure 4-43 illustrates the 
contents of a typical cookie.

	How long do cookies remain on a device? There are two kinds 
of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. 
Session cookies. Some cookies are stored in memory and are deleted 
when the browser is closed. These session cookies are never stored on a 
disk or other permanent storage medium.
Persistent cookies. Cookies that are stored on a device after a session 
ends are referred to as persistent cookies. These cookies remain on a 
device until they expire or are deleted. Some persistent cookies are pro-
grammed to time out after a designated date. When one of these cookies 
reaches the end of its predefined lifetime, your Web browser simply erases 
it. Some persistent cookies have no expiration date or expire on a date far 
into the future, so they tend to accumulate in the main storage area of digital 
devices. 
	What’s the problem with cookies? A first-party cookie is set by 
the domain that hosts a Web page. A third-party cookie is set by a site 
other than the one you connected to. Third-party cookies are often set by 
Web sites that have affiliations with wide-ranging ad-serving companies able 
to combine cookie data from multiple sites to create profiles of a person’s 
browsing habits. These profiles are used to generate targeted ads for prod-
ucts that might appeal to the profiled person’s interests.
Profiles compiled by ad aggregators are not always accurate. But regardless 
of their accuracy, those profiles generate ads and other offers that pop up in 
your browser window with maddening frequency. Figure 4-44 explains how 
third-party cookies are used to create profiles.
Next, you visit Sports.com, 
where there is an ad for SlimSlurp, 
another member of the WeSeeU 
ad network. Now your device is 
accumulating WeSeeU cookies.

	Is it possible to see the cookies stored on a device? You can 
view a list of cookies stored on your device. Some parts of cookies are 
generally encrypted, so you cannot tell exactly what they contain. You can, 
however, see where the cookies are from. Cookies from domains such as 
adnxs.com, doubleclick.com, fetchback.com, 33across, and ad.360yield.com 
are likely to contain tracking information that is shared with advertisers. 
Periodically, you can take a look at your accumulated cookies to gauge the 
amount of tracking information that is building up. For instructions about 
locating cookies, refer to your browser documentation. Figure 4-45 shows 
how to find cookies stored by Google Chrome. 
	Can I block cookies? Blocking all cookies drastically changes your 
Web experience. When you don’t allow sites to set cookies on your device, 
those sites cannot keep track of your preferences or purchases. 
Rather than turning off all cookies, you may prefer to turn off third-party 
cookies. Doing so should eliminate much of the profiling that is produced by 
cookies. Blocking cookies does not eliminate ads, however. You’ll still see 
ads in your browser window, but they will be more generalized. Figure 4-46 
illustrates the procedure for blocking third-party cookies in Google Chrome.

HTTPS
When you see https:// in the address box, pay attention. It is important.
	Is HTTP secure? No. HTTP transports unencrypted data between your 
device and a Web server. Your login passwords, credit card numbers, and 
other personal data are not secure on an HTTP connection. The data you 
transmit to a Web server can be secured, however, if it is sent over an HTTP 
Secure connection, which encrypts the data stream between client devices 
and servers.
When submitting personal data, you can verify that it will be transmitted 
by HTTP Secure if the URL in the address box begins with https://. Your 
browser might also display a lock icon as further verification (Figure 4-47).
	How does HTTP Secure work? Sites that use HTTP Secure are 
required to present an SSL certificate to the browser. This certificate helps 
the browser verify that the site is not pretending to be another site. Your 
browser may indicate the status of the SSL certificate. Figure 4-48 shows 
the SSL certificate icons Google Chrome displays to help you decide if a 
connection is secure and if it is safe to enter personal data.
 ICON
WHAT IT MEANS
The site’s certificate is valid and its identity has been verified by a 
trusted third-party authority.
The site has not provided the browser with a certificate. This 
is normal for a regular HTTP site (look for the 
 icon in the 
address bar), because certificates are usually provided only if the 
site uses SSL.
Google Chrome has detected problems with the site’s certifi-
cate. You should proceed with caution because the site may be 
pretending to be another site in order to trick you into sharing 
personal or other sensitive information with them.

	How does HTTPS encryption work? HTTP Secure is based on 
HTTP and a public key encryption technology called SSL/TLS. Public key 
encryption is a very clever process that requires one key to encrypt data, but

Search Engine Basics
According to Google, the Web has more than 60 trillion unique pages and it 
continues to grow. We depend on search sites, such as www.google.com, 
www.yahoo.com, www.bing.com, and www.ask.com, to quickly locate spe-
cific pages. But behind the simple act of entering a search query, there is 
mind-boggling technology. Let’s see how it works.
	What is a Web search engine? A Web search engine (commonly 
referred to simply as a search engine) is a computer program designed to 
help people locate information on the Web by formulating simple queries 
consisting of one or more words called keywords or search terms. 
In response to a query, the search engine displays results, or “hits,” as a 
list of relevant Web sites, accompanied by links to source pages and short 
excerpts containing the keywords (Figure 4-50).
	What is the difference between a search engine and a search 
engine site? It is easy to think of www.google.com as a search engine; 
but to be precise, it is a Web site that offers access to a search engine. A 
search engine is the program that works behind the scenes to gather, index, 
find, and rank information from the Web. 
Some sites, including Google, use their own proprietary search engines, 
but other sites use third-party search technology. For example, Microsoft’s 
Bing search engine is the underlying technology used for Yahoo! searches.

SECTION E, UNIT 4
	How do search engines work? A search engine contains four com-
ponents: 
Web crawler: Combs the Web to gather data that’s representative of the 
contents of Web pages
Indexer: Processes the information gathered by the crawler into a list of 
keywords and URLs stored in a database
Database: Stores billions of index references to Web pages
Query processor: Allows you to access the database by entering search 
terms, and then produces a list of Web pages that contain content relevant 
to your query
Let’s take a look at each of these components to find out how they affect 
your ability to mine information from the Web.
	What is a Web crawler? A Web crawler (also referred to as a Web 
spider) is a computer program that is automated to methodically visit Web 
sites. Web crawlers can be programmed to perform various activities as 
they visit sites; but in the context of search engines, Web crawlers down-
load Web pages and submit them to an indexing utility for processing.
	How does a Web crawler know where to go? A Web crawler 
uses a search algorithm to traverse the Web. It begins with a list of URLs to 
visit. The URLs on this list may have been submitted by Web site owners, 
but more commonly they are collected from the links that exist on previously 
crawled Web pages. 
After copying the material at a specified URL, the Web crawler looks for 
hypertext links and adds them to the list of URLs to visit next. To cover the 
Web as efficiently as possible, a Web crawler can run multiple processes in 
parallel. Sophisticated algorithms keep processes from overlapping or get-
ting stuck in loops (Figure 4-51).

Use the main link 
to view the page as 
it currently exists.
Use the cached link to 
see the page as it existed 
when the crawler visited.
	How much of the Web does a Web crawler cover? High-
performance Web crawlers can visit hundreds of millions of Web pages 
a day. Those pages, however, only constitute a fraction of the Web. 
Researchers estimate that the most extensive search engines cover 
no more than 70% of the Web. Each search engine seems to focus on 
a slightly different collection of Web sites. The same search entered into 
different search engines can produce different results, so it is sometimes 
worthwhile to try alternative search engines. 
Web crawlers generally do not gather material from the invisible Web, 
which encompasses pages that require password-protected logins and 
pages that are dynamically generated with server-side scripts. 
The potential volume of dynamically generated pages, such as all the pos-
sible pages that Amazon.com could generate from its inventory database, 
is just too great to feasibly index. To access information related to online 
merchandise or library catalogs, you might have to go directly to the mer-
chant’s or library’s Web site and use its local search tools.
	How frequently do Web crawlers revisit sites? When you query 
a search engine, you want the results to be up to date so that you don’t 
waste time trying to link to pages that have changed or have been deleted. 
Search engines use various algorithms to refresh their indexes. 
The number of times a search engine’s crawler visits a Web page varies, 
depending on several factors such as how often the page tends to change 
and its popularity. Obscure pages might be visited only once a month, 
whereas the pages at a news site would be visited daily. 
Search engine results are based on the material on a Web page when the 
crawler last visited it. Content can change by the time you link to a page, 
but you can look at the cached page to see the exact page indexed by the 
crawler (Figure 4-52).
Figure 4-52: Cached Pages 
	How do search engine indexers work? A search engine indexer 
is software that pulls keywords from a Web page and stores them in an 
index database. The purpose of the indexer is to make pages easy to find 
based on their contents. For example, a Web page at a mountain biking 
site might contain information about bikes, gear, riding, and trail maps. 
Keywords that might help catalog this page for future access include moun-
tain, bike, trail, directions, gear, Colorado, bikepacking, and bunny hop.

SECTION E, UNIT 4
	What does a query processor do? A search engine’s query pro-
cessor looks for your search terms in the search engine’s indexed database 
and returns a list of relevant Web sites. Google’s query processor handles 
more than 45,000 queries per second. On some days the total number of 
Google queries exceeds 6 billion! Each query is processed in less than a 
second. What happens in that second is summarized in Figure 4-53.
	What determines the order of results? A query processor is likely 
to find millions of pages that contain words matching the query. The order in 
which those pages are listed depends on the search engine’s ranking algo-
rithm. Google keeps this algorithm a closely guarded secret so that Web 
site developers can’t manipulate pages to get better placement.
The underlying ranking algorithm is based on the number and quality of 
links to a page. Link popularity is a measure of the quality and quantity of 
the links from one Web page to others. Pages with links to and from popular 
sites tend to get high relevancy ratings (Figure 4-54).

	Can a search engine be manipulated to give a high ranking 
to a page? A series of techniques called search engine optimization 
(SEO) can affect the ranking and visibility of Web pages. Search engine 
companies, such as Google, Yahoo!, and Bing, provide guidelines for opti-
mizing Web sites and the pages they contain. Figure 4-55 summarizes 
some of these SEO techniques.
	What are sponsored links? Some search engines accept paid ads 
called sponsored links, which are bumped to the top positions on the 
results list. Other search engines also accept paid ads but place them in a 
clearly marked area (Figure 4-56).

SECTION E, UNIT 4
Formulating Searches
Basic queries consist of a few keywords. When these basic queries don’t 
produce useful results, you can try advanced query techniques. 
	How do I formulate a basic search? Most search engines work 
with keyword queries in which you enter one or more words, called 
search terms, related to the information you want to find. For example, if 
you’re interested in Batman comics, you can simply type Batman (Figure 
4-57).
More than 400 million 
results were found.
The word Batman was 
entered as the search term.
When formulating queries, keep the simple guidelines from Figure 4-58 
in mind.
Case. Most search engines are not case sensitive, so you don’t have to use 
the Shift key when entering proper nouns.
Stop words. Search engines generally ignore common “stop” words, such as 
and, a, and the, so don’t bother to include them in your query.
Stemming. The top search engines use stemming technology that automati-
cally looks for plurals and other variations of the search terms you enter. For 
example, if you enter diet, the search engine also looks for pages with terms 
such as diets, dietary, and dietician.
Order. A search for time machine produces different results than a search 
for machine time.
Location. If your search engine is able to determine your location, your 
results might be affected. Most search engines give you an option to change 
your location or hide it.
Context. Search engines build on your previous searches. If you formulate 
several Batman-related searches and then search for dark night, your search 
engine might assume that you are looking for information about the Batman 
movie The Dark Knight instead of astronomy information. Google uses this 
predictive technology unless you clear your Web history.

	How do I get more targeted results? Narrowing a search can 
reduce the number of results and produce a more targeted list. It may seem 
counterintuitive, but entering more words in a query produces fewer, more 
targeted results. 
Whereas the short query Batman produces about 400 million results, a 
query for Batman first appearance in a comic book produces fewer than 1 
million results, and those listed first link to information about when Batman 
first appeared in the May 1939 issue of Detective Comics. 
	What are search operators? A search operator is a word or symbol 
that describes a relationship between search terms and thereby helps you 
create a more focused query. Figure 4-59 provides a quick overview of how 
to use search operators when formulating searches.
AND
When two search terms are joined by AND, both terms 
must appear on a Web page before it can be included in the 
search results. 
Batman AND movies
Result: Pages about Batman movies
OR
When two search terms are joined by OR, either one or 
both of the search words could appear on a page. 
Batman OR Catwoman
Result: Pages about Batman and pages about Catwoman	
NOT
The search term following NOT must not appear on any of 
the pages found by the search engine. 
Batman NOT Catwoman
Result: Pages about Batman, but no pages about Catwoman
“  ”
To search for an exact phrase, enter it in quotes.

	Is it possible to filter results by file type? Some search engine 
sites offer separate searches for academic works, images, videos, news, 
maps, and blogs. Look for links to these specialized searches at your favor-
ite search engine sites (Figure 4-60).
	What is an advanced search? Many search engines provide ways 
to make your searches more precise and obtain more useful results. You 
might be able to use advanced search options to limit your search to 
material written in a specific language or stored in a specific file format. 
You might be able to specify a date and stipulate whether to look for your 
search terms in the title, URL, or body of the Web page (Figure 4-61).

Search Privacy
It is troubling that browsers store a list of sites you’ve visited and cache 
the files for those sites. And then there are cookies that can be used to 
profile your browsing activities. Yet another intrusion into your privacy is 
the data stored in query logs maintained by search engines.
	Do search engines keep records of queries? Considering that a 
major search engine can receive billions of queries every day, the surpris-
ing answer to this question is “yes.” Search engines at major sites such as 
Google, Bing, and Yahoo! save massive numbers of searches made by site 
visitors. Industry analysts believe that some sites retain user queries for at 
least 30 days and that at least one search engine site has retained every 
search ever made at the site. 
In 2006, AOL provided researchers with a database of 20 million queries 
made by site visitors. Figure 4-62 illustrates a small section of this database 
for queries made by users interested in Batman.
Figure 4-62: Should Search Engines Retain Users’ Queries?
User 6497 spent several minutes 
looking for Batman underwear. 
Later, this user also searched for 
aircraft carrier and CIA.
	What kind of information does a search engine store? Your 
search history contains a list of queries that you’ve made in a specific 
search engine. It is not the same as your browser history, which is a list of 
Web sites you’ve visited and is maintained by your browser. Search history 
is stored in server logs on the search engines’ computers. In its Privacy 
Policy, Google provides the example of a server log shown in Figure 4-63.

	Can I access my search history? Check your search engine’s pri-
vacy policy to find out if it offers access to your search history. Google 
search history can be viewed and deleted at www.google.com/history. It is 
accessible only if you have a Google account and log in.
	What can I do to keep my searches confidential? For Google 
users, connect to www.google.com/history and select Turn Web history off. 
If you do not have a Google account or are not logged in, go to www.google.
com/history/optout and select the link named Disable customizations based 
on search activity.
Yahoo! users can control search history settings from the Search History 
option on the Settings menu. Bing users can find settings on the History 
page at www.bing.com/profile/history. 
Some browsers do not maintain server logs of searches. Browsers such 
as DuckDuckGo, Startpage, and Ixquick offer private, untracked browsing. 
These sites claim to delete all activity logs every day or two, but they may 
be subject to law enforcement scrutiny.
Anonymizer sites, such as www.torproject.org, act as relay stations to for-
ward your searches to Google or other search engines without leaving a 
trail back to a cookie or an IP address. Tor also offers a browser that runs 
on a distributed network to cloak queries. Although law-abiding citizens 
may have nothing to hide, the increasingly invasive tracking and advertising 
at many Web sites is leading many Web surfers to select search engines 
that offer privacy.
Using Web-based source material
Most browsers provide Copy and Save commands that allow you to obtain 
text and images from a Web page, which you can then paste into your own 
documents. 
	How do I save the source? To keep track of the source for each text 
section, you can highlight the Web page’s URL in the Address box, use the 
Copy command, and then paste the URL into your document (Figure 4-64).
You can copy the Web site URL 
and paste it into your word 
processor to use as a citation.
To highlight a passage of text, hold 
down the mouse button while dragging 
the I-beam pointer from the ­beginning 
of the passage to the end of it.

	How do I cite sources? Presenting someone else’s work as your own 
is plagiarism. If you copy text, pictures, or other works from a Web page, 
be sure to credit the original author. Information that identifies the source 
of a quotation or excerpted work is called a citation. Written documents, 
such as reports and projects, generally include footnotes, endnotes, or in-
line citations formatted according to a standard style, such as MLA, APA, or 
Chicago.
When compiling the citation for online sources, be sure to provide sufficient 
information so readers can locate the source. Also, include the date when 
you accessed the source and the full URL. According to APA style, a citation 
to a Web-based source should provide a document title or description; the 
author’s name, if available; the date of publication, update, or retrieval; and 
a URL. 
	Do I need permission to use material? In the United States, the 
Fair Use Doctrine allows limited use of copyrighted material for scholarship 
and review without obtaining permission. For scholarly reports and projects, 
for example, you can use a sentence or paragraph of text without obtaining 
permission if you include a citation to the original source. 
Photos and excerpts from music and videos can be used within the con-
text of critique, but their use purely as decorative elements for a document 
would, in most cases, not be considered fair use.
Some Web sites clearly state allowable uses for material on the site. Look 
for a link to Terms of Use. For example, the YouTube Web site contains 
a collection of videos submitted by amateurs and semi-professionals, who 
retain the copyright to their materials. The Terms of Use section of the site 
allows the public to access, use, reproduce, distribute, create derivatives of, 
display, and perform user-submitted works. Even with such broad terms of 
use, however, it is essential to cite the original source of the material if you 
incorporate it in your own work.
	How do I get permission? To obtain permission to use text, photos, 
music, videos, and other elements you find on the Web, contact the copy-
right holder by email, and explain what you want to use and how you plan to 
use it. You can often find contact information on the Web site, if not for the 
copyright holder, at least for a Web master who can direct you to the copy-
right holder.

When you incorporate Web-
based material in research 
papers, why is it not necessary 
to get permission from the 
source?
a.	 Because the Fair Use 
Doctrine allows it
b.	 Because the material is not 
copyrighted
c.	 Because it is on the Web
d.	 Because your school library 
has a deal with the content 
owner
1.	
A search engine’s 
 pulls 
keywords from a Web page and stores them in a 
database.
2.	
When you enter search terms, the search 
engine’s 
 processor looks 
for the terms in the search engine’s database. 
3.	
AND, OR, and NOT are examples of search 
 .
4.	
Most search engines keep track of users by 
assigning a unique ID number, which is stored in 
a(n) 
 on the hard disk of the 
user’s device.
5.	
To keep track of the Web pages where you 
obtained information or images, you can high-
light the Web page’s 
 , copy 
it, and then paste it into a list of sources. (Hint: 
Use the acronym.)

CHAPTER 7
Issue: Who’s Tracking You?
In the Movie Harry Potter and the Prisoner 
of Azkaban, Harry acquires a magical item called 
the Marauder’s Map, which shows the location of 
every teacher and student at the Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
In the context of Harry Potter, tracking technology 
seems fun; but real-life tracking technologies have 
a dark side, which privacy advocates 
fear might be misused by governments, 
corporations, and possibly criminals to 
monitor the daily activities of ordinary 
people. 
According to the EFF (Electronic 
Frontier Foundation), “Tracking is the 
retention of information that can be 
used to connect records of a person’s 
actions or reading habits across space, 
cyberspace, or time.”
Two broad categories of tracking are 
behavioral tracking and locational 
tracking. Behavioral tracking accu-
mulates information about what you 
do: the Web sites you visit, the merchandise you 
purchase online, and the people with whom you cor-
respond. Locational tracking records your physical 
location: where you live and work, where and when 
you shop, and the route you take to get to school.
Tracking made headlines in 2011 when Pete Warden 
and Alasdair Allan discovered that iPhones collect and 
store date-stamped infor-
mation that triangulates 
the phone’s location. A 
simple software applica-
tion called iPhone Tracker 
can retrieve this data and 
display it on a map.
The iPhone tracking 
story spread like wild-
fire over the mainstream 
media, blogs, and social 
networks. Privacy advo-
cates pointed out that 
government agencies, 
disgruntled spouses, parents, and criminals could 
easily trace a person’s whereabouts. 
Apple responded with a press release explaining the 
need to collect location data for LBS (location-based 
service) applications to work efficiently. The press 
release also apologized for a “bug” that allowed track-
ing data to be collected even when location-based 
service was turned off. 
The technology that makes it 
easy for a cell phone to track 
your movements can be incor-
porated into other handheld 
devices and tucked into vehicles, 
identification badges, pet collars, 
clothing, and even tiny chips that 
can be implanted under the skin. 
Tracking is controversial, espe-
cially when it occurs without the 
consent or control of the trackee. 
Privacy advocates want strict 
protocols for collecting, using, 
storing, and distributing location 
information. They face opposition, however, from law 
enforcement officials who would like to explore ways 
location technology can be used to track criminals 
and prevent terrorism. 
Commercial interest in tracking technology for mar-
keting and advertising is also high and consumers 
seem willing to give up some privacy for the con-
venience offered by 
location-based ser-
vices, such as Yelp 
and Foursquare. 
The outcome of con-
flicting interests will 
determine if location-
tracking technology 
can be implemented 
in such a way that the 
rights and privacy of 
individuals are pro-
tected.

TRY IT! Locational tracking is kind of creepy. The idea that someone 
can pinpoint where you regularly use your digital devices is a little unset-
tling; but knowing that someone might be tracking your movements as you 
travel from home to school, to the mall, to the doctor, and to the movies 
might give you more than a moment of concern. Explore tracking technolo-
gies to arm yourself with knowledge that can help protect your privacy.
	 As an experiment, make sure that location services are turned on for 
one of your digital devices, and track your activities for one day. If pos-
sible, print out a map. Read the article “How Your iPhone is Tracking 
Your Every Move” published on The Telegraph Web site. Pay particu-
lar attention to the summaries that the article’s writers add toward the 
end of the article. After you collect your tracking data, write a similar 
summary of your impressions of your own tracking data. The following 
instructions will help you turn tracking on for various devices: 
	
Android smartphones. Go to Settings and make sure Location ser-
vice is on. Turn on Google Location Reporting and Location History. 
After you’ve tracked for a day, view your location history on a map by 
connecting your device to maps.google.com/locationhistory. 
	
iPhones. Go to Settings, Privacy, Location Services, and turn 
Location Services on. Then, scroll down to System Services, turn on 
all settings, and select Frequent Locations. After you’ve tracked for a 
day, view the track by scrolling down, selecting History, and selecting a 
location. 
	
Laptops. You can install free tracking software such as FollowMee 
GPS Tracker (www.followmee.com), Prey (preyproject.com), and 
Adeona (adeona.cs.washington.edu). Follow the installation instruc-
tions provided on the software’s Web site.
	 Privacy advocates support Do Not Track regulations. You can explore 
this concept by looking for Do Not Track at www.eff.org or Wikipedia. 
What are the similarities and differences between Do Not Track and 
Do Not Call?
	 The location of digital devices can be pinpointed using three different, 
but complementary, technologies: GPS, cell-tower triangulation, and 
WPS. Use Wikipedia and other online resources to explore these tech-
nologies. How would you describe each technology?
	 Tracking usually happens behind the scenes, often without a user’s 
knowledge or approval. However, information that people intentionally 
post online can also be used to track their locations. Think about the 
information that you post on your social networking and media sharing 
sites. How might that information be used to determine your location or 
track your movements?
1. Do you worry about behavioral tracking based on your Internet use?
2. Do you have a device that can track your physical location?
3. Do you support efforts to institute Do Not Track?

TRY IT! Let’s go beyond the basics and work with some advanced 
citation tools. Use any word processor and create a document called 
Citation Project [Your Name], then complete the following steps: 
	 Suppose that you’d like to include information from press releases 
in a research paper. How should you format the citations? Use a 
search engine to look for How do I cite a press release. Next, search 
for a recent press release from Apple. Create a citation for the press 
release and save it in your Citation Project document.
	 Some academic directories/databases provide citation information for 
the resources they list. BibTeX, illustrated at right, is a common format.
	
Open an academic directory of technology articles, such as Microsoft 
Academic Search, TDG Scholar, ACM Digital Library, or Odysci. 
Search for BitTorrent articles and select one. Look for the Bib or 
BibTeX icon, then click it. Notice that each element of the reference is 
clearly labeled. Copy the BibTeX data and paste it into your Citation 
Project document; you’ll find out how to format this citation data in the 
next steps.

Be sure to collect data for the article itself, not simply the directory 
that lists the article.
When using automated citation formatters based on ISBNs or 
DOIs, look carefully at the citation that is produced to ensure that 
it contains all required citation information.

Technology in Context: Fashion Industry
Fashion is big business. Worldwide, 
clothing sales generate more than $340 billion in 
revenue. Shoes, accessories, and jewelry bump the 
industry’s revenue even higher. Competition is tough 
as designers, manufacturers, and retailers compete 
for customer dollars. 
In the fashion industry, trends change quickly. As the 
saying goes, “Today’s style is tomorrow’s markdown.” 
Fashion industry players look for every competitive 
advantage. It is no surprise that technology plays a 
major role in this glitzy industry. 
Fashion begins with designers, such as Miuccia 
Prada, John Galliano, and Marc Jacobs. Their runway 
extravaganzas set off fashion trends that eventu-
ally work their way to retail stores. Fashion runways 
went high-tech in 1999 when lingerie manufacturer 
Victoria’s Secret produced a Webcast 
watched by over 1 million viewers. 
Bravo television’s Project Runway show 
has been one of the top iPod down-
loads. Fashion podcasts and blogs 
abound on the Web, as do fashion 
sites packed with news about the latest 
trends.
Although runway fashions are often 
conceived with a sketch and stitched 
by hand, designs are adapted for the 
ready-to-wear market by using com-
puter-aided design (CAD) tools, such 
as pattern-making software. 
Garments are constructed by sewing 
together sections of fabric that form 
arms, fronts, backs, collars, and so forth. The set 
of templates used to cut fabric sections is called a 
pattern. Pattern-making is a tricky 3-D challenge 
because flat pieces of fabric eventually become gar-
ments shaped to conform to curved body contours. 
Pattern-making software helps designers visualize 
how flat pieces fit together and drape when sewn. 
Once a master pattern is complete, pattern-making 
software automatically generates a set of patterns 
for each garment size.
Fashion requires fabric, and computers play a major 
role in fabric design and manufacturing. Computer 
software, such as ArahWeave, lets fabric design-
ers experiment with colors, yarns, and weaves while 
viewing detailed, realistic on-screen samples. 
Most of today’s weaving mills use computerized 
machinery that directly accepts digital input to control 
threads and patterns. Networks tie looms to CAD sta-
tions and to the Internet. Fabric designs can be stored 
in XML format, transmitted to a fabric manufacturer 
over the Internet, and used directly by computerized 
weaving machines.
Fabrics that can alert the wearer to conditions in their 
surroundings are currently being developed. Two stu-
dents at the Tisch School of the Arts designed a shirt 
that can detect carbon monoxide. Microcontrollers 
change the color of the shirt’s thermochromatic fabric 
to alert the wearer of harmful pollutants in his or her 
vicinity.
Clothing production, warehousing, and shipping are 
also highly automated. Benetton’s high-tech facility 
in Castrette, Italy, can produce over 110 million gar-
ments per year. Its automated distribution center 
uses a workforce of only 24 people to handle 40,000 
boxes of merchandise daily. RFID tags—sometimes 
called smart labels—can be attached to individual 
garments or to packing boxes as an important tool 
for controlling inventory. 
RFID technology uses an inexpensive, tiny computer 
chip with a built-in antenna and the capacity to store 
between 64 and 128 bits of data about a garment—
its SKU number, size, model, dye lot, manufacturing

date, and so on. Tags can be attached to a garment 
or its label. An RFID reader that can retrieve data from 
tags is used to track merchandise from the manu-
facturing plant through the distribution chain to the 
retailer. 
RFID tags are becoming popular for all types of mer-
chandise. Businesses that use them can save time 
and money. For example, RFID tags can reduce the 
time it takes to do a physical inventory by a factor of 
10. Privacy advocates, however, are worried because 
these tags remain active even after you bring your 
merchandise home. Could a thief circle your house 
with an RFID scanner to find out what’s inside? Could 
a stalker follow your movements by tracking the RFID 
tag embedded in your sweater? 
Next time you buy a gar-
ment, check to see if an 
RFID tag is attached. It 
would normally be sewn 
into a seam and may 
carry a warning such as 
“Remove before wearing.” 
Online shopping has 
become routine, but one 
drawback of catalog and 
online ordering is the cost 
associated with restock-
ing returned merchandise. 
Can an online customer 
find out how a garment will 
fit and look before ordering it? Can in-store customers 
find their correct size without trying multiple sizes?
Retail stores, such as Selfridges and Bloomingdales, 
have installed body-scanning “pods” that use Xbox 
Kinect technology to produce three-dimensional vir-
tual models of customers. The images help customers 
find the perfect pair of jeans online or in person with-
out trial and error. 
No discussion of fashion and technology would be 
complete without highlighting wearable technology. 
MIT’s Media Lab has been a hotbed of wearable 
technology development. A recent student project 
uses a webcam, a battery-powered projector, and 
an Internet-enabled mobile phone, and allows wear-
ers to use hand gestures in 3-D space to conjure up 
information from the phone and project it on any sur-
face.
Some wearables have even emerged from the labora-
tory and onto store shelves. 
Originally popular with Secret Service agents, jackets 
produced by SCOTTeVEST include pockets for a cell 
phone, MP3 player, and iPad, and built-in wiring to 
connect these devices into a personal area network 
(PAN). Available in both men’s and women’s sizes, 
the jackets can now be purchased by civilians. 
At the more extreme end of the wearable technology 
spectrum and sometimes reminiscent of technol-
ogy found in science-fiction books and movies, solar 
panels that can be used for charging smartphones 
and other mobile devices are starting to illuminate 
the more fashionable end of wearable technology. 
Clothing designer Pauline van Dongen’s Wearable 
Solar clothing incorpo-
rates traditional fabrics and 
materials such as wool and 
leather with high-technol-
ogy solar cells strategically 
hidden in the garment to 
create an aesthetically 
pleasing and functional 
high-tech fashion state-
ment. 
E v e n  m o r e  e x t r e m e 
and futuristic, invisibility 
cloaks made from smart 
fabrics and metamateri-
als are beginning to blur 
the line between camouflage and invisibility. Using 
technologies that bend light around a special fab-
ric, companies such as HyperStealth Biotechnology 
Corp. have developed products that they call “active 
camouflage.” One promising camouflage technology 
uses fractals to create repeated patterns with the abil-
ity to change color. Whether this technology becomes 
more popular on the runway or in the military is yet to 
be determined.
With a growing emphasis on the use of technol-
ogy in fashion design and manufacturing, fashion 
degree programs at colleges and technical schools 
have added courses such as computer-aided fash-
ion design, computer-based pattern drafting, pattern 
grading and computer-aided drafting, and wearable 
computers.

Flipped Class Projects
Critical Thinking
Your browser tracks the Web sites you’ve visited 
and saves Web page files in its cache. The search 
engine you use stores a record of your search 
queries. The U.S. government seems to be record-
ing all of the data that flows over the Internet. 
Advertisers track your Web activities using cook-
ies. How much do these privacy incursions bother 
you? Which seem the most disturbing? Have you 
taken steps to curb these intrusions, or in your 
opinion is tracking no big deal?
Group Project
The purpose of this project is to hone your search 
skills. Work in groups to develop a set of five ques-
tions for a Web scavenger hunt. The questions 
should have concrete answers and should not 
be easy to locate with a simple Wikipedia query. 
Exchange your group’s question set with another 
group, then see which group finds all the answers 
first.
Cyberclassroom
The use of digital devices in the classroom is con-
troversial. In some classrooms, digital devices are 
welcomed and incorporated into activities. In other 
classrooms, digital devices are seen as a distrac-
tion. Compile a list of your personal observations 
about the way digital devices are used in classes 
by you and the students around you. Be prepared 
to share your observations in a class discussion. 
Multimedia Project
Surf the Web to select a home page that needs 
improvement. Use the PrtSc key on your keyboard 
to take a screenshot of the original page. Paste 
the page into graphics software such as Paint 
and store it as Home Page Original [Your Name]. 
Use your graphics software to create an improved 
home page. Consider a design that works both on 
a full-size screen and on the screens of mobile 
devices. Also consider how the design works with 
a mouse or touchscreen. Save your makeover as 
Home Page Makeover [Your Name]. Make a list of 
the changes you made. Submit the original page, 
the makeover page, and the list of changes to your 
instructor.
Resume Builder
Many companies have a Web site that provides 
information on their products and services. Use a 
search engine to locate a company in your career 
field. Suppose you are a recruiter for that company 
and you’ll be attending a series of college career 
fairs. Create a one-page information flyer that you 
can hand out to prospective recruits. The flyer 
should include:
• The company’s name, URL, and physical 
location(s)
• A brief description of the company’s mission, 
products, and services
• Instructions on how to submit a resume electroni-
cally
Globalization
We’re accustomed to seeing Web pages in 
English. But for a growing number of Web surf-
ers, English is not their native language. Explore 
online resources to find the current percentage of 
Web pages that are published in languages other 
than English. Also explore to find the number of 
Web users who are not English language natives. 
As a supplemental activity, use Advanced search 
to find a Web page in a language such as Arabic 
or Chinese, and use Google Translate to view the 
same page in English. Record your impressions 
about Web access across the spectrum of human 
languages.

Interactive Summary
SECTION A: The Web, one of the Internet’s hot-
test attractions, is a collection of document, image, video, 
and sound files that can be linked and accessed over the 
Internet via the 
 protocol. The Web 
is an interlinked collection of information, whereas the 
 is the communications system used to 
transport Web information. The Web evolved from a concept 
called 
 , which describes a collection of 
literary documents linked according to logical relationships. 
In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee developed the technologies used 
for today’s Web. An Internet-based computer that stores and 
distributes Web files is called a Web 
 . 
It can host one or more Web 
 such 
as www.wikipedia.com or www.facebook.com contain-
ing HTML 
 documents, which can be 
accessed and displayed using client software called a Web 
 . Each Web page has a unique address 
called a(n) 
 . 
SECTION B: Today’s popular browsers include 
Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google 
 , 
Apple Safari, and Mozilla Firefox. The browser that starts 
automatically when clicking links in email messages is 
called the 
 browser. Browsers 
can be customized in many ways—for example, by add-
ing 
 for pages you use frequently. 
Browser 
 such as AdBlock and tool-
bars add functionality to browsers. Browsers may need addi-
tional software programs called 
 
to work with various file formats. Browsers can also store 
 to make logging in to Web sites 
more convenient. Browser users can decide whether or 
not to turn this feature on even though it is a slight security 
risk. When browsers download HTML documents, images, 
and links for a Web page, they are stored in a browser 
 . Browsers also store a list of the 
Web sites you’ve visited in the 
 list. 
Turning on 
 browsing stores these 
items only temporarily and deletes them when the browser is 
closed.

SECTION E: To sift through the massive amounts of 
information available on the Web and locate pertinent informa-
tion about a topic, Web surfers utilize programs called search 
 . These special programs have four 
major components. A Web 
 , also called 
a Web spider, is automated to methodically visit Web sites 
and gather Web pages. A search engine 
 
culls keywords from the gathered pages and stores them 
in a(n) 
  . The search engine’s query 
 accepts one or more words called search 
 , looks them up in the database, and pro-
duces a list of relevant Web sites. There are a number of ways 
to narrow searches and produce more targeted results, such as 
using 
 operators or putting exact phrases 
in 
 . The order in which Web sites are 
returned in response to your query is dependent on relevancy 
criteria, such as keyword matches and 
 
popularity. 
SECTION c: The current version of HTML is 
 , which was introduced in 2010. 
HTML is an example of a(n) 
 language 
that uses HTML 
 , such as <h1> and 
<p>, to specify the format for text and images. A similar lan-
guage, called 
 , is used to describe 
data by inserting tags that represent database fields. An 
HTML document is also called a(n) 
 doc-
ument, which can be viewed from within a browser. Several 
online and local tools are available for creating HTML docu-
ments. An HTML document consists of two parts: the Head 
and the 
 . The specifications for text 
styles in Web pages can be included in 
 
style sheets. These can be 
 , internal, or exter-
nal. A link to an external CSS document can be inserted 
in the 
 section of an HTML docu-
ment. Using HTML and CSS, Web designers can create 
a(n) 
 Web page that displays the 
same information regardless of who accesses it. Designers 
can also use client-side and server-side scripting to create 
 Web pages featuring animations or 
content that is customized for a specific user. Web sites can 
be posted on Web 
 services, where they 
can be thoroughly tested before being open for public access. 
SECTION D: HTTP is the Web’s communica-
tions 
 that works with TCP/IP 
to deliver elements of Web pages to a local browser. A 
browser communicates with a Web server using HTTP 
 such as GET and POST. An HTTP 
 is a sequence of transactions that 
typically include a browser request and the server’s response. 
HTTP 
 codes, such as 200 and 404, 
indicate whether the server was able to fulfill the browser’s 
request. HTTP is a(n) 
 protocol, which 
cannot detect if a sequence of sessions originate from the 
same source. To compensate, Web servers use cookies, 
which store a small file of data on the user’s device. Cookies 
can be collected during subsequent sessions to keep track 
of pages viewed and items purchased. 
 
cookies remain on the local device after a session ends. 
Cookies can be set by the domain that hosts a Web site. 
Additional cookies can be set by advertisers that have a pres-
ence on the site. These 
 -party cookies can be 
blocked using browser settings. HTTP is not a secure trans-
port protocol, so financial transactions and personal data 
should be submitted to Web servers using a more secure 
protocol that displays 
 in the browser 
address bar. This technology uses 
 
key encryption to scramble the data while it is in transit.

1.	
Your friend, who is a little computer phobic, is going 
to create his first Web page, and he asks you to 
recommend some software for the task. Which one 
requires the least knowledge of HTML tags: Notepad or 
LibreOffice Writer? 
 
2.	
Suppose you visit a Web site that has eye‑catching 
pages. You want to know how these pages were 
formatted, so you use one of the options on 
your browser’s menu to take a look at the HTML 
 document.
3.	
Suppose you click a link at a Web site and receive a 
message that the file cannot be displayed because it 
is in PDF format. To view the file, you need an updated 
version of your browser. True or false? 
 
4.	
You’d prefer not to have the search engine you use 
maintain accumulative records of your searches. You can 
block 
 from a specific search engine 
site, and that setting will force the search engine to assign 
a different ID number to you for each session.
5.	
One of your relatives wants to try online shopping but is 
suspicious that her credit card number might get stolen 
from a merchant’s server by a hacker using a packet 
sniffer. Is it correct to tell her that she can best avoid 
these potential rip-offs by using a secure connection, 
such as HTTPS? Yes or no? 
 
6.	
You’re conducting a research project that requires you to 
visit sites that include lots of pop-up ads and other junk 
that you don’t want accumulating in your browser cache. 
You remember that you can turn on 
 
browsing to delete all that junk when you end your 
session.
7.	
Your friend boasts that she has finally got her browser 
secured so her Web activity won’t be tracked. A couple 
of days later, she complains that she can’t check out at 
Zappos.com. You’re pretty sure that she has blocked
 .
8.	
You’ve designed your first Web site and it looks great. 
But you know that the design is only the beginning of 
the process of developing a Web site. To make sure 
that your pages get the best ranking and most visibility, 
it is important to consider techniques for search engine 
 .
9.	
Your Web pages should all have a similar design based 
on heading styles, fonts, and colors. Using an external 
 keeps the design consistent for all 
the pages on your site.
10.	 Suppose that you want to add some simple interaction 
to your site by changing the color of buttons when 
they are clicked. You can accomplish this goal using 
 -side scripting.

HTML CAN BE FUN. Really! The basics of HTML and CSS are easy, and this lab will give you an opportunity to 
design a customized home page. 
REQUIREMENTS: 
For this lab, you’ll need a computer running Mac OS X or Windows 7, 8, or 10. Your computer should be connected 
to the Internet. The instructions are generalized; they provide helpful guidelines but not specific steps. You may have 
to explore a bit to find all the tools needed to complete the assignment, but that is all part of the learning experience. 
ASSIGNMENT:
 Connect to an online HTML editor, from a site such 
as www.jsfiddle.net or www.rendera.org. 
You might be happiest with an HTML editor that allows 
you to save your work, so look for a Save button before 
you begin. When this book was published, jsFiddle and 
Rendera both offered great tools for HTML and CSS.
 Enter the outline for a basic HTML document using 
the template in Figure 4-30.
 Modify the template to add your name as an h1 head-
ing at the beginning of the Body section of the document.
The HTML code will look something like this:
<p><h1> Sarah Smith </h1></p>
 Make sure the editor is able to show you what your 
Web page will look like when displayed in a browser.
If you are using jsFiddle, click the Run button and look 
for your results on the right side of the screen. If you are 
using Rendera, click the gray “Click me” bar near the top 
of the screen.
 Next, locate a photo that you like on the Wikimedia 
site and copy its URL.
To copy the URL, right-click the photo and select Copy 
Image URL.
 Return to the HTML editor and enter the tags to insert 
the image. Make sure you include the quotation marks. 
The HTML should look something like this:
<img src="http://name_of_photo.jpeg" style="left:5
6px;top:236px;height:232px;width:174px;position: 
absolute; > </img> 
You can play around with the numbers for left, top, height, 
and width until the image is positioned where you want it 
to be.
Add two more images positioned artistically on the page.
 Add a hypertext link under the photos that leads 
to your favorite Wikipedia page. Your link should look 
something like this:
<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Astronomy"> I love Astronomy! </a> </p>
 Next, turn to the CSS tab or work area and enter the 
code to center the h1 style for your name and display it in 
the color of your choice. Here is a sample:
body 
{ font-family: arial; }
h1 { color: purple; text-align: center; }
 Finally, select colors for the link and add the code to 
the CSS, like this:
a:link { color: green; }
a:visited { color: blue; }
 Save your work in a format that you can submit to 
your instructor. Depending on the HTML editor you used, 
you may:
• Take a screenshot using the PrtSc key (Windows) or 
Command-Shift-4 (Mac).
• Save a file locally and email it to your instructor.
• Save the URL and submit it to your instructor.
• Copy the text of your HTML and CSS, then paste it into 
a text editor, such as Notepad or TextEdit. Submit that 
document to your instructor.

THE SOCIAL MEDIA LANDSCAPE is 
vast. From megasites such as Facebook to emerg-
ing niche services such as Drimmit, social media 
have spread across the globe. They now soak 
up hours of screen time and spill over into other 
media outlets such as news, television, and mov-
ies. Section A offers some structures for selecting 
and categorizing social media services, and then 
focuses on social networking and surprising 
linkages that put the concept of Six Degrees of 
Separation to the test.

The Social Media Mix
Across the globe, billions of people participate in social media, using ser-
vices such as Facebook, Twitter, Blogger, Pinterest, YouTube, Wikipedia, 
Yelp, and Flickr. The variety of social media offerings is immense, and trying 
to take part in all of them would be a daunting task. So choices have to be 
made. Let’s look at the social media mix available to you.
	What are social media? Social media are online services that 
facilitate communication and interaction among people who want to share 
information about their lives, issues, and events using a multimedia mix of 
text, pictures, video, and audio. 
Classifying social media provides a general structure for comparisons and 
helps you to understand their benefits. Various classification schemes have 
been proposed for social media. For example, one way to classify social 
media is by their focus. In such a classification, a professional social media 
service such as LinkedIn would be placed in a different category from 
friends-and-family services such as Facebook and Google+. 
Social media are sometimes categorized by the type of content that they 
support. Text-based services, such as Blogger and WordPress, would be 
classified differently from image and video services, such as Flickr and 
YouTube. 
The Social Media Honeycomb provides a visual model for classifying and 
comparing various social media services. Each hexagon in the honeycomb 
represents a social media building block. Look at the honeycomb in Figure 
5-1 and think about how strongly the characteristics in each hexagon apply 
to your favorite social media site.

	How does the honeycomb help me compare social media 
services? Each social media service emphasizes a different set of social 
interactions. Services such as LinkedIn emphasize identity but do not 
encourage conversations among users. Facebook and similar services tend 
to emphasize relationships among users, with a secondary emphasis on 
conversations, identity, presence, and reputation. In the social media hon-
eycombs shown in Figure 5-2, darker hexagons indicate factors with more 
emphasis.

	What are the most popular social media services? New social 
media services pop up every day, or so it seems. Some are in the spot-
light briefly, while others have more staying power. In this unit, social media 
are categorized into four groups: social networking, geosocial networking, 
content communities, and online communications. Figure 5-3 offers a brief 
overview of these categories and lists some of the most popular services in

Section A, Unit 5
Social Networking evolution 
Let’s turn our focus from the broad spectrum of social media to the spe-
cific category of social networking. Today’s social networking landscape is 
dominated by Facebook, but social media were born in a rapidly changing 
environment, and they are likely to continue to evolve as consumer prefer-
ences change. It may seem as if social networking sprang up overnight 
when Facebook went online, but that is not the case.
	What are social networking services? A social networking 
service revolves around personal profiles and interconnections among 
subscribers who want to share information about themselves. 
	What was the first social networking service? Social network-
ing can be traced back to online services, such as CompuServe, Prodigy, 
and America Online (AOL), that were not part of the Internet. The popu-
larity of those services decreased as a new generation of Internet-based 
services emerged. The timeline in Figure 5-4 traces the evolution of social 
networking services.
	How are social networking services likely to evolve? When 
it comes to the online social scene, history tells us that nothing lasts for-
ever. Consumer tastes change, and a site with billions of users today can 
all too quickly become old news. A report from the research division of the 
asset firm Piper Jaffray indicates that the number of teens using Facebook 
dropped by about 30% in 2014. 
Teen preferences for simpler social media platforms such as Instagram, 
Twitter, and Snapchat may be a glimpse of the future in which a young 
demographic seeks easy-to-use smartphone-based communication plat-
forms, and career-minded individuals maintain LinkedIn profiles.

Before the Internet was opened to public 
use, online services offered fee-based sub-
scriptions to a dial-up network housed on 
the service’s proprietary computers, which 
hosted discussion groups, email, reference 
databases, games, and software applica-
tions.
Public access to the Internet and the World 
Wide Web transformed the online experi-
ence with an expanding user base and faster 
connections. Social networking pioneers, 
such as Classmates.com and Friendster, set 
up shop at Web sites. They were followed 
by similar services, including an offbeat 
animated world called Second Life, which 
enjoyed a brief period of wild popularity. 
Facebook remains the most popular social 
networking service despite challenges from

Social Networking Basics
Each social networking service has its own focus and terminology. “Friends” 
on one service are called “followers” or “connections” on other services. 
“Likes” might be called “+1s” or “endorsements.” When joining a social net-
work, one of your first steps should be to get a handle on its terminology, 
which will help you learn how to use its features. 
	What should I know about social network profiles? A person’s 
presence on a social media service is referred to as an online identity. 
Each online identity is encapsulated in a profile. A social media profile is the 
set of information provided to friends, contacts, and the public. A basic profile 
generally includes a user name, an image, and a few lines of descriptive text. 
Figure 5-5 illustrates profiles from several popular social networking services.
Figure 5-5: Social Media Profile Elements 
Terminology
Online identities are also called 
personas and avatars. 
Try It!
Visit your favorite social 
networking service and look at 
the profiles for at least three 
people. Which of these profiles 
seems most effective? 
A Twitter profile can include a photo and a tagline. Bill Gates sets a good 
example, using his tagline to provide potential followers with informa-
tion about the topics he tweets about.
Google+ profiles can be professionally designed to establish an effective 
online presence, such as this profile for Ron Paul that promotes his Web 
site, Voices of Liberty.
Facebook profiles help to build your online identity. Here LeBron James 
makes effective use of text and graphics to create a personal brand.

GeoSocial Networking
In 2014, Apple caused an uproar when it removed Genius from the App 
Store and replaced it with a Near Me control. Genius was a handy feature 
that recommended apps based on the user’s profile of purchased music 
and downloaded apps. Near Me recommends apps based upon what’s 
installed on other devices nearby. For example, a grandparent attending a 
college graduation might get recommendations for CliffsNotes and Yik Yak. 
A college student visiting a grandparent’s retirement community might get 
recommendations for Pillboxie and Silver Surf. Geosocial networking is 
suited for some applications, but not for others.
	What is geosocial networking? One of many types of social net-
working, geosocial networking provides a platform for users to carry out 
interactions based on their current locations. Some of the most popular 
and well-designed geosocial networking services include Yelp, Foursquare, 
Banjo, and Google Maps. Social networking services, such as Facebook 
and Twitter, also offer geosocial features. 
Geosocial networking services can help you find the nearest popular res-
taurant, pinpoint the location of your friends’ favorite biking trails, get special 
deals from nearby merchants, and leave feedback about business services 
and products. An emerging subset of geosocial networking called social 
discovery uses geolocation to meet with people who are nearby and have 
similar interests. The basic activities offered by geosocial networking are 
summarized in Figure 5-7.
Figure 5-7: Geosocial network Activities
	What is crowdsourcing? When individuals contribute computer time, 
expertise, opinions, or money to a defined project, they are participating 
in crowdsourcing. For example, Yelp provides restaurant ratings com-
piled from user reviews. Amazon, Zappos, and other online merchants also 
collect and display customer reviews. For a project called SETI@home, 
individuals volunteer computer time to analyze radio telescope signals for 
signs of extraterrestrial life. 
Crowdsourcing is based on contributions from groups of individuals, but it 
differs from collaborative work. For collaborative work, participants interact 
with each other to achieve a goal. Crowdsourcing does not require col-
laboration among participants. Contributions from each crowd participant 
are aggregated by the crowdsourcing platform. For example, the rating 
for Cathy’s Cafe is not created by Yelp users chatting with each other until 
they agree on a three-star rating. Instead, reviewers submit independent 
reviews, which are consolidated by algorithms on the Yelp platform.

Section A, Unit 5
	How does geolocation work? A person’s physical location is deter-
mined by signals emitted by his or her digital device. Most people are aware 
that mobile devices, such as smartphones, send out location signals that 
can be used to track the device. Desktop computers, laptops, and tablets 
without GPS or cellular service can also be located, though not with depend-
able accuracy. Figure 5-8 lists four ways that the location of a device can be 
determined.
Figure 5-8: Location services
	What should I keep in mind about geolocation? Location-
aware apps may use more than one type of location service. The location 
services settings for a digital device can be used to enable or disable loca-
tion tracking for each individual app.
Geosocial networking depends on geolocation, so your participation 
requires an accurate assessment of your location. If you want to be found, 
activate all available location services by making sure GPS, cellular, and 
Wi-Fi are turned on. If you don’t want to be found, make sure that all of 
those location services are turned off.
	What is geotagging? Presenting information about what’s nearby 
requires places and landmarks to be tagged with their location. Restaurants 
featured on Yelp, for example, must have a street address or longitude 
and latitude available in a machine-readable format that can be interpreted 
by the geosocial networking service’s search engines. Geotagging and 
geocoding provide the necessary geographical information.
Geocoding is the process of determining the coordinates of a specific 
place, such as the street address or the longitude and latitude of Cathy’s 
Cafe. Geotagging is the process of adding location data to photos, Web 
sites, HTML documents, audio files, blog posts, and text messages. 
Standard formats for geotagging and geocoding ensure that location data 
can be read by the computer programs operated by geosocial networking 
services.

A service that displays the 
location of a post office on a 
map is using ________ data.

b.	 geocoded
c.	 social media
d.	 crowdsourced

IP address lookup
IP addresses can provide a rough estimate of a device’s loca-
tion based on information in the WHOIS database. The country 
in which a device is located can be determined with 99% accu-
racy. However, the accuracy of pinpointing the region or city 
dwindles to about 50%.
Cell tower triangulation
Cellular telephone companies monitor the position of mobile 
phones relative to nearby cell towers. If a phone is turned on 
and within range of three towers, a process called cell tower 
triangulation can determine the position of a device to an area 
of about three-quarters of a mile.
Hotspot triangulation
This technique can gauge the location of a Wi-Fi router based 
on its signal strength relative to nearby routers. Desktop and 
laptop computers connected to the router can be assumed to 
be operating within a circle of about 50 feet.
GPS trilateration
This service locates  smartphones and other devices contain-
ing GPS chips. It is accurate to within about three square yards.

Social Network Analytics
The now infamous game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is based on a notion 
that any Hollywood actor can be linked to Kevin Bacon in six steps through 
the actors’ roles in various films. The Six Degrees of Separation  concept 
originated in a 1929 short story by author Frigyes Karinthy, whose charac-
ters devised a game of figuring how to most quickly relay a letter between 
any two people on Earth based on links between their personal acquain-
tances. Today, tools let us map and analyze social networks. What do they 
tell us?  
	How are social networks mapped? Social networks are not exclu-
sively online. Everyone has face-to-face networks of family, friends, and 
acquaintances, who in turn have their own networks of social connections. 
You may envision these networks as points connected by lines. Sociologists 
use social network diagrams called sociograms to depict connections 
between people. 
The circles in these diagrams are referred to as sociogram nodes. The lines 
connecting nodes are referred to as sociogram edges. Two-way edges 
exist when two people consider each other to be friends. One-way edges 
exist when a relationship is not reciprocal, such as a Twitter follower who does 
not follow back. What do the connections in Figure 5-9 tell you about the rela-
tionships between characters in The Lord of the Rings? 
Figure 5-9: Anatomy of social Networking
The thickness of connecting lines (edges) indicates connection strength. 
Node colors indicate which characters are most important.

Section A, Unit 5
	Is it possible to sort through the complexity? Sociograms can get 
extremely complex, which makes connections difficult to trace and analyze. 
An alternative method for depicting social connections is with an adjacency 
matrix. 
A binary adjacency matrix is simply a set of cells containing a 0 if there 
is no connection between two people and a 1 if there is a connection. The 
adjacency matrix in Figure 5-10 depicts the relationships between some of 
the elves and hobbits of Middle Earth as a sociogram and as an adjacency 
matrix.
	What else does the matrix reveal? Matrices can be manipulated 
visually and mathematically to reveal more information about social connec-
tions. These manipulations can reveal pathways, connections, and groupings 
that lead to all sorts of revelations. Law enforcement agencies hope to use 
such techniques to uncover criminal organizations, and national security 
agencies hope to follow links to identify members of terrorist groups.
Suppose we rearrange the matrix so the two hobbits and the two elves are 
adjacent. The results are interesting. The rearranged matrix in Figure 5-11 
seems to indicate that the hobbits chose each other as friends, but the elves 
were not friends with other elves. Therefore, the elves would not be likely to 
conspire with each other to overthrow Middle Earth or to save it.

elf rows intersect with elf 
columns.

elf rows intersect with elf 
columns.

In the rearranged matrix, the two hobbits are adjacent as 
are the two elves. Color blocks illustrate the general rela-
tionships between hobbits (red) and between elves (green).
This matrix shows the percentage of con-
nections within each block, with hobbits 
well connected, but elves not connected 
to each other. 
In this sociogram, Bilbo 
considers Elrond his friend, 
but Elrond does not con-
sider Bilbo to be his friend.
The intersection of dark blue cells in the adjacency matrix contains a 
1 to show that Bilbo considers Elrond his friend. Can you find the cell 
that indicates Elrond does not consider Bilbo to be his friend?

	How do analytic tools apply to online social networks? 
Sociograms and other analytic tools help us understand the quality and 
quantity of our personal social networks. The concept of one-way edges is 
important, for example, in understanding that although you may receive status 
updates directly from the President of the United States and the First Lady, 
you are not likely to enjoy a similar link in the other direction. 
Social network analytic tools also uncovered a very odd phenomenon. Does it 
seem like most of your friends have more friends than you have? It turns out 
that is the case with more than 80% of Facebook users. This phenomenon 
is referred to as the class size paradox because it is related to the reason 
students feel that they are always in larger than average classes. The expla-
nation is that people tend to choose popular classes and friends, and such 
popularity does indeed mean that the classes are larger and your friends will 
have more friends than you have. Figure 5-12 offers a few additional interest-
ing friend facts. 
	So how many degrees of separation are there on social net-
works? In 2001, a professor at Columbia University set out to track the path 
of more than 50,000 email messages forwarded from senders to intermediar-
ies, wending their way to one of 19 designated people with undisclosed email 
addresses. The average number of intermediaries turned out to be six—an 
amazing confirmation of the Six Degrees of Separation theory.
Researchers studying Twitter connections, however, found the average 
degree of separation was less than 4. Researchers at Facebook discovered 
that the average number of hops between people in 2008 was 5.28. Three 
years later, as Facebook membership expanded, the degrees of separation 
dwindled to 4.74.

Evolution
Back before the Internet, the creative world was controlled by a small set of 
gatekeepers who influenced popular culture. Music moguls decided which 
bands to promote. Hollywood studios selected the films that were pro-
duced. The editors at publishing houses filtered the books and magazines 
that went to print. 
Today, those old gatekeepers are easy to bypass because online content 
communities so effortlessly distribute books, photos, videos, and music. 
Popularity no longer depends on endorsement by an elite band of critics, 
but instead by a democratic vote of “Likes” from everyday folks. Where this 
democratization of culture leads is anyone’s guess. The availability of tools 
to create and distribute digital media removed the old gates but erected 
new barriers to talent based on the sheer volume of media that compete for 
screen time.
	What is a content community? Many social media sites, such as 
Wikipedia, YouTube, and Flickr, were designed as repositories for user-
generated content. These social media sites are sometimes called content 
communities. Although it can be said that just about every social media 
site is populated with user-generated content, content communities empha-
size the content itself, unlike social networking sites that revolve around 
user identities.
Content communities may focus on text-based information, or their focus 
may be on other media, such as photos, music, or video. Content commu-
nities typically have the characteristics listed in Figure 5-13.

SECTION b, Unit 5
	When did content communities originate? The bulletin board 
systems (BBSs) of the 1970s contained user-generated content and 
could be considered forerunners of today’s content communities as well as 
today’s social networks. Bulletin boards were popular for about 20 years 
before other efforts to gather and archive meaningful collections of online 
content emerged. 
One of the first online content communities was Project Gutenberg. Started 
in 1991 by Michael S. Hart and now supervised by a nonprofit organization, 
Project Gutenberg’s mission is to preserve literary works, particularly those 
with expired copyrights. Initially, volunteers manually entered the text from 
printed books; however, today, books are digitally scanned. 
In 2001, another text-based collaborative appeared. An online encyclope-
dia called Wikipedia was launched, and a community of contributors quickly 
formed around it.
In 1999, the Webshots community became one of the first social media 
sites for sharing photos online. Competing communities such as Flickr and 
Photobucket soon followed. Video content communities launched with the 
founding of YouTube in 2005, and that same year the world saw the first 
instance of an online video that went viral. SlideShare opened in 2006, 
offering an archive of PowerPoint-style slide presentations.
Pinterest, founded in 2010, revived interest in photo sharing communities, 
with its use of “boards” containing a collection of related items, such as pho-
tos of fashions, home decor, or book covers. Mobile photo sharing became 
popular in 2010, when Instagram made it simple to snap, modify, tag, and 
share photos taken with the easy-to-use smartphone app shown in Figure 
5-14.

Media content communities
Media content communities are so popular that most people with an Internet 
connection have logged in to take a look at videos from YouTube and images 
from sites such as Flickr. Lots of people participate in these communities by 
posting media. Many people become unknowing participants when they are 
the subject of photos and videos posted by others. 
	How do media content communities work? Media content com-
munities specialize in user-generated images, videos, animations, and audio. 
Community members create and post original media files, such as videos, 
photos, or audio tracks.
Posted content can be accessed by others using a general search engine or 
an internal search engine provided by the community site. Community mem-
bers who post content can specify whether it is available to the public or to a 
limited list of other members. Unlike wikis, where editing the source content 
is encouraged, the media in content communities are not usually modified by 
other users. 
The technological core of media content communities is server-based con-
tent management software and an associated database, which stores 
content and information about that content. Once media is posted to a server, 
it may remain there indefinitely.
Some media communities incorporate advertising as a source of revenue 
both for content creators and for operational income. The fact that content 
communities have few options for generating revenue may lead to their 
eventual demise if advertising revenue cannot sustain operational costs for 
server space and administrative personnel.
	How do I post content to a media community? Although many 
content communities allow open access to media, most require registra-
tion before files can be uploaded. Content communities offer simple tools 
for uploading media files from a computer, and most offer apps that handle 
uploads from mobile devices. Figure 5-15 illustrates how easy it is to upload a 
photo to Flickr from a computer.

	What should I know about tagging media? A metadata tag is 
simply a keyword that describes information, such as the content of a media 
element. In the context of content communities, tags are used to describe 
people and places in photos and videos. 
Unlike documents and other text-based information, media elements contain 
no text that can be used for indexing, identification, or searching. Tags make 
it possible to search for photos or videos using keywords, such as Caribbean, 
beach, sun, water, and palm trees. Audio file tags help to locate tracks based 
on musicians’ names, record labels, recording dates, and so on.
Informal tagging simply requires content creators to assign one or more 
keywords to a media element. The format for entering tags depends on the 
community. Some require a comma between tags, whereas others simply 
separate tags with a space.
Formal tagging methods add information to a tag according to a set of tag-
ging standards. These standards make it possible to create generalized 
media search engines that can locate media from multiple locations. 
Dublin Core Schema is an example of a formal tagging standard. It can be 
used for digital resources as well as for physical media such as CDs, books, 
and phonograph records. 
	Have I been tagged? Suppose that an acquaintance takes an unflat-
tering photo of you and posts it on Facebook with your name as one of the 
tags. If you are not friends with the poster, you may never see the post, but 
wouldn’t you want to know about it?
Facebook and several other social media services provide ways to discover 
if you’ve been tagged. On Facebook, you can access your activity log, select 
photos, and then filter for public posts. If you find yourself tagged, you can 
choose to remove the tag yourself or ask the poster to remove the entire 
photo (Figure 5-16).

Intellectual Property
Content communities put all types of media at your fingertips. You have 
access to photos, stories, reports, videos, animations, and music all in digital 
formats that are easy to copy, modify, and incorporate into your own works. 
But just because you can access this media doesn’t necessarily mean that 
it is legal or ethical to use it. Conscientious citizens of content communities 
know how, when, and where it is okay to use the media created by other 
community members. 
	What is intellectual property? People are creative. They produce 
beautiful art. They invent useful machines. They write captivating novels. 
All of the creations that materialize from the mind or intellect are considered 
intellectual property. Inventors, artists, writers, and other creative individu-
als are the owners of their intellectual property. Like other property, intellectual 
property is protected by various laws and regulations. 
There are four categories of intellectual property: patents, trademarks, copy-
rights, and trade secrets. Some of the media in content communities can be 
classified as trademarks, but most of it is copyrighted material.
	What should I know about trademarks? A trademark is any 
word, name, symbol, or design used in commerce to identify and distinguish 
the goods of one company from those of another. Twitter’s little blue bird is 
a trademark, as is Facebook’s stylized “f” logo. Trademarks occasionally 
display a ® or TM, but those marks are sometimes not visible. You should 
assume that all company logos are trademarks that are legally protected 
from misuse by law.
Many companies with an online presence, such as a Web site, provide infor-
mation about the acceptable use of their trademarks. Before including a 
company’s logo on your Web site, in a blog, or as part of a Pinterest board, 
check the company’s policy on the use of its trademark. You may find, for 
example, that it is acceptable to use Facebook’s Like button on your Web 
site, but that it is not permissible to mash up a banner image for your site 
that combines your name with the Facebook logo (Figure 5-17).

SECTION B, Unit 5
	How much stuff is copyrighted? Copyright is a form of legal pro-
tection that grants the author of an original work an exclusive right to copy, 
distribute, sell, and modify that work. Copyright applies to “works” such as 
photos, books, articles, plays, dance performances, videos, animations, 
sound effects, musical compositions, and audio recordings. 
Just about everything available on content communities is protected by 
copyright. It is not necessary for the work to carry a copyright notice, nor is it 
required that the work’s creator register the work to obtain copyright protec-
tion. Any original work automatically becomes copyrighted as soon as it is 
created, and the rights in Figure 5-18 can only be exercised by the copyright 
holder. 
	Is it legal to use copyrighted works? The copyright holder has total 
control over how a work may be used. The default protections make it illegal 
for anyone else to copy, distribute, perform, display, or license the work, or 
to prepare derivatives of it. That means it would be illegal, for example, to 
copy a photo from a content community and publish it as a Facebook post 
or as an illustration for a magazine article without the copyright holder’s per-
mission.
Copyright holders can give permission for the use of their work, and you 
don’t necessarily have to obtain that permission by contacting them in per-
son. Copyright holders have two ways to allow their works to be used by 
others: They can place a work in the public domain, or they can license the 
work.
	When does a work become part of the public domain? 
Public domain refers to the status of works with expired copyrights or 
whose creators have forfeited their copyright. The works of Shakespeare, 
for example, are in the public domain. Anyone can perform one of 
Shakespeare’s plays or publish an anthology of his works. However, the 
1996 film Hamlet directed by Kenneth Branagh is a new instance of the 
work and is protected by copyright. 
In the United States, copyrights do not expire until 70 years after the author’s 
death, and various loopholes allow for extensions. Legal specialists some-
times have difficulty determining if a work has reverted to the public domain. 
Even when a work seems very old, it is best not to assume that it is in the 
public domain.

Creative Commons
A nonprofit organization called Creative Commons (CC) has done content 
communities a welcomed service by providing a set of standardized licenses 
that copyright holders can use to extend the rights to use their works to 
others.
	What is a Creative Commons license? A Creative Commons 
license is based on five rights that copyright holders can grant or deny to 
others (Figure 5-19).
Figure 5-19: Creative Commons License Rights
Attribution. When the work is used, the copyright 
holder must be given credit for the work in a citation or 
another appropriate manner.
Share Alike. New works based on the original must be 
distributed under the same license as the original work.
No Derivatives. The work must not be changed when 
it is redistributed or shared.
Public Domain. All rights are granted 
for reuse or the work has been placed in 
the public domain.
Noncommercial. The 
work may not be used for 
commercial purposes.
Creative Commons rights can be combined for a variety of licenses.

SECTION b, Unit 5
	How do CC licenses work? Copyright holders can assign any com-
bination of CC rights to create a license. For example, a photographer who 
posts a photo on Flickr might offer a CC BY-ND license, which means it has 
a Creative Commons license allowing the photo to be used as long as there 
is a credit line attributing the photographer (BY) and the photo is not modi-
fied to create a derivative work (ND). 
The Share Alike right is sometimes referred to as copyleft. The term copyleft 
was chosen to convey the idea that it is the opposite of copyright. Whereas 
copyright is designed to limit the use of a work, copyleft is designed to 
make a work freely available for distribution and modification under the con-
dition that all derivative works use the same license. Copyleft works and 
their derivatives cannot be later licensed in a way that would restrict their 
use. 
Before using any work that you find at a content community, check for a 
Creative Commons license. You’ll usually find them in the tags for a photo.
	Can I assign a CC license to my own work? When you create a 
work, it is automatically protected by copyright and you have exclusive rights 
to its distribution, modification, and sale. If you would like to release some 
of those rights to make the work easier for others to use and share, you can 
assign a Creative Commons license. Figure 5-20 explains how to assign CC 
licenses to various types of media.

	What about fair use? Earlier units touched on the concept of fair use, 
which allows for the limited use of copyrighted material without obtaining per-
mission from the copyright holder. United States copyright regulations include 
four factors that characterize fair use:

The purpose and character of the use. The use of copyrighted mate-
rials without permission is more likely to be “fair” when the materials are 
transformed and used for a purpose different from that of the original work.

The nature of the copyrighted work. Guidelines for fair use of photos 
may differ from guidelines for music, videos, or written works.

The amount of the copyrighted work that is used. Quoting a para-
graph from a book is more likely to be fair use than reproducing an entire 
chapter.

The effect on the value of the copyrighted work. Uses that deprive 
the copyright holder of income are not generally considered fair use.
	Is a transformative work different from a derivative work? 
Yes. A derivative work modifies a copyrighted work but does not substan-
tially change its content or purpose. Translations, adaptations, musical 
arrangements, dramatizations, reproductions, condensations, and similar 
modifications would all be considered derivative. 
Mashups that combine two or more music tracks into a single recording 
are usually regarded as derivative works because they are intended for the 
same uses as the original recordings. Derivative works are not fair use, and 
they require permission directly from the copyright holder or from an appli-
cable license, such as CC BY.
A transformative work repackages a copyrighted work to add new meaning 
or produce a work that is used for a purpose different from the original work. 
Parodies, for example, are considered transformative. Cutting up magazine 
covers to create a collage to hang on a wall would also be considered a 
transformative use. 
Transformative works are considered fair use; they can be produced and 
distributed without the copyright holder’s permission.
Although the differences between derivative and transformative works may 
seem clear, in practice copyright holders are free to sue anyone who pro-
duces a work that is based on their copyrighted works. The courts are the 
ultimate decision makers in copyright infringement cases. If you want to 
safely incorporate the works of others into your own work, use only works 
that have a CC BY or CCØ license.

Blogs
The democratization of culture is not limited to art; it spills over into the 
mainstream news media. Today, blogs provide alternative news sources 
that offer a greater diversity of topics and opinions than pre-Internet 
gatekeepers such as Reuters, Associated Press, and CNN. The ease of 
broadcasting information has become a major disruptive force with no clear 
outcome in sight.
	What is a blog? A blog (short for Web log) is similar to an online diary; 
it is maintained by a person, a company, or an organization, and it contains 
a series of entries on one or more topics. Blog entries are text based, but 
can also include graphics and video. They are usually displayed in reverse 
chronological order on a scrollable Web page. 
	What are the basic elements of a blog? Whether you are creating 
your own blog or browsing blogs created by others, you should be aware 
that blogs are based on a standard set of elements illustrated in Figure 
5-21.

	How can I find and access blogs? Blogger and WordPress are the 
most popular blogging platforms. They provide tools for creating blogs and 
offer subscription services so that you can follow your favorite blogs. You 
can use an RSS reader or blog aggregator to set up a “feed” that monitors 
your favorite blogs, collects the latest posts, and displays them. 
You can find blogs by going to Blogger and WordPress or by simply launch-
ing a Google search such as Skateboard Blogs. Another option is to use a 
blog catalog, such as Alltop (Figure 5-22).
How would you discover if there 
are any skateboarding blogs on 
WordPress?
Try It!
	Why are blogs disruptive? Most blogs are open to the public, so 
blogging has become a form of personal journalism. Bloggers can chase 
down facts, write commentary, post photos, and offer opinions. Blogs have 
been used extensively for political commentary, celebrity publicity, and tech-
nology news. 
The blogosphere—all the blogs and their interconnections—is influential. 
Some bloggers have been tapped to be commentators for headline news 
shows on CNN and FOX. Top blog sites with huge readerships post earnings 
of more than $1 million per year, though most sites cater to small audiences 
without expectation of profits.
Blogs and other Internet-based news outlets have the potential to reach 
mass audiences. Totalitarian governments, which can control mainstream 
media, find it more difficult to silence a multitude of freelance bloggers than 
a small group of professional journalists. In that respect, blogs support 
democratic free speech values and have the potential to disrupt oppressive 
governments.
Blogging also offers an alternative source of news and information, reduc-
ing the audience for mainstream news outlets. The fact that blogs and many 
Internet-based news outlets offer free access has disrupted print-based 
news media by reducing sales and forcing major newspapers to shutter 
operations. Industry analysts are concerned that if this trend continues in the 
years ahead, few reliable mainstream news outlets will remain.

	Who is responsible for blog content? Professional journalists and 
the media companies they represent are guided by a code of ethics that 
encourages seeking truth, reporting it, minimizing harm, resisting outside 
influences, and maintaining accountability. Bloggers, who may not have jour-
nalistic training or the supervision of responsible corporations, sometimes do 
not understand the importance of accountability, the procedures for verifying 
information, or the significance of intellectual property. 
Overall, the information provided by blogs tends to be less reliable than infor-
mation from the mainstream media. However, many reliable and professional 
blogs exist. As with other online and offline materials, readers are ultimately 
responsible for evaluating the quality of information in a blog. Figure 5-23 
offers some tips for evaluating blogs.
Who is the blogger? Look for information about the blogger’s 
expertise at sites other than the blog.
What are the blog’s readership and Alexa rating? Popular blogs 
tend to be more reliable because they are subject to scrutiny 
by many readers.
Are comments substantive and supportive? Blogs that gen-
erate negative comments and corrections may not contain 
accurate information.
How extensive is the blog’s archive? Well-established blogs 
may remain active for many years, so look at the blog’s track 
record and also make sure it contains recent posts.

Microblogs
The Hudson River plane crash, the Osama bin Laden raid, and the Boston 
Marathon bombings are some of the breaking news stories that appeared 
first on Twitter, a social media service that relays information from the mun-
dane to the extraordinary.
	What was the original idea behind Twitter? Twitter was modeled 
as a Web-based version of the text messaging services offered on mobile 
phones. Just as those services were limited to 140 characters, Twitter mes-
sages, called tweets, also carry such a limit. Twitter is an example of a 
microblogging service because a Twitter message is basically a short blog 
post. 
Twitter originated as a social networking service where participants could 
keep track of what their friends were doing based on trivial status updates 
such as “I’m heading to my bio class” or “Just saw Peter at the Laundromat.” 
As the service evolved and the participants’ circles of influence mush-
roomed, Twitter’s focus expanded to include topics of more substance, in 
addition to a continuing stream of personal updates. Some examples of 
Twitter’s expanding influence include the following:
A platform for breaking news. In 2008, NASA researchers used Twitter 
to announce an exciting discovery from the Phoenix Mars mission: “Are you 
ready to celebrate? Well, get ready: We have ICE!!!!! Yes, ICE, *WATER 
ICE* on Mars! w00t!!! Best day ever!!”
Citizen journalism. In 2009, a US Airways plane made an emergency 
landing in the Hudson River. Before mainstream news reporters arrived on 
the scene, Twitter carried the breaking news along with photos of passen-
gers being rescued from the wing of the slowly sinking plane.
Celebrity watching. Twitter illustrates and reinforces the power of celeb-
rity. Oprah Winfrey had more than 100,000 followers on the day she opened 
her Twitter account. Ellen DeGeneres’s selfie at the 2014 Oscars became 
the most popular tweet of all time.
Online presence. Companies from McDonald’s to Starbucks have estab-
lished corporate Twitter accounts where product information can be quickly 
disseminated to customers. Corporate presence on social media sites is a 
requirement of doing business in the digital age.
Public opinion. Twitter users can be quick to comment about breaking 
events and controversies, though their opinions may be based on informa-
tion gleaned from a mere 140 characters of information. Principles of justice, 
such as innocent until proven guilty, can be forgotten as Twitter users rush 
to tweet reactions to trending controversies. A series of studies by the Pew 
Research Center reveals that Twitter users are not representative of the 
general public, however, so Twitter polling may not be effective for predicting 
voting and buying behaviors, for example.
Social organizing. Twitter’s ability to quickly disseminate informa-
tion makes it a desirable platform for social organizing. Notable examples 
include organizing the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, the 2011 Arab 
Spring demonstrations, and the 2014 HandsUpDontShoot protests. Twitter 
and other social media were also used, however, by government authorities 
to track down and arrest protesters.

	What’s the basic Twitter vocabulary? Twitter has a vocabulary all 
its own, and some of its terminology has spilled over to other social media. 
Figure 5-24 presents Twitter jargon in the context of a Twitter page.
Twitter handle: User name
Tweet or status update: Messages of 140 or fewer characters
Retweet: A tweet that is forwarded from one Twitter user to others 
Promoted tweet: Tweets that contain paid advertising and are labeled to dis-
tinguish them from non-commercial tweets
Twitter stream: A list of tweets; a user’s home page Twitter stream shows the 
user’s own tweets and tweets from anyone the user is following
Follow: Specifying a Twitter user whose tweets you want to receive
Follower: A Twitter user who follows your tweets
Follow back: When Twitter users mutually follow each other (e.g., Sue follows 
Joe, and then Joe follows Sue back)
@ mention: A person who is referred to in a tweet with his or her Twitter 
handle preceded by an @ symbol (e.g., mentioning @BillGates in a tweet 
broadcasts it to your followers and places it in Bill Gates’ Mentions tab)
Reply: A message sent in reply to a tweet; automatically addressed to the 
source of the original tweet preceded by the @ symbol
# hashtag: A hashtag such as #ipadgames that specifies a keyword that can be 
used to find and group tweets by topic, both in Twitter and across other social 
media; clicking a hashtag in a tweet displays all the other tweets with that 
hashtag (A directory of hashtags can be found at www.hashtags.org)
DM: Direct, email-like messages sent by Twitter users to any of their followers 
using the Messages option on the navigation bar
Trending: Tweet hashtags that are popular for a period of time
	How substantive is the information on Twitter? There is no 
doubt that tweets shape the social dialogue. Mainstream news organiza-
tions use tweets as a source of breaking news and as indicators of public 
opinion. Although socially significant discussions occasionally appear in the 
list of trending topics, a casual review of trending topics and popular Twitter 
handles seems to reveal a breathtaking number of tweets that have little 
social relevance.
Researchers have found Twitter to be a fascinating topic of study. Notable 
efforts include a study of Twitter trending topic classification conducted at 
Northwestern University and a project called Truthy, run by researchers at 
the University of Indiana and funded by the National Science Foundation, 
that monitors a group of mostly conservative political hashtags “to detect 
political smears, astroturfing, misinformation, and other social pollution.”

Wikis
The content communities that turn heads today serve up user-generated 
videos and images. However, some of the oldest and most productive con-
tent communities are built upon text-based wikis.
	What is a wiki? A wiki is a collaborative Web application that pro-
vides tools that enable contributors to post, read, and modify content. For 
example, one contributor might write and post an article about wolves. 
That article can be read and modified by others. Changes to an article are 
tracked, allowing the community to view changes, leave changes in place, 
or revert back to earlier content. 
Wiki software runs on a wiki server and provides a set of tools for creating 
and editing content. Content is stored in a file system on the wiki server, and 
changes to the content are tracked in a database. Popular wiki software, 
such as MediaWiki, is open source, so anyone can create and host a public 
or private wiki. The world’s most popular wiki is Wikipedia.
	How does Wikipedia work? Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia. It 
uses MediaWiki software to manage more than 31 million topic pages in 285 
languages. Wikipedia receives more than 500 million page views per day 
as people from all over the world seek factual information about the arts, 
geography, history, science, society, and technology. Wikipedia is organized 
by topics, such as Wolves, Tolkien, London, American Revolution, and 
Skateboards. 
Wikipedia pages can be accessed, viewed, and edited anonymously by the 
general public without subscription or registration. Participants are encour-
aged to register with the Wikipedia community and become “Wikipedians.” 
As of 2014, more than 75,000 participants were regular contributors. These 
editors not only contribute new material and updates, but also monitor 
pages to ensure that they retain high-quality contents, adhere to Wikipedia 
standards, and not subject to vandalism. 
	What are Wikipedia standards? Wikipedia endeavors to provide 
non-biased, accurate, and verifiable information. Content creators and edi-
tors are encouraged to filter material through a sieve of strict standards 
known to insiders as NPOV, NOR, RS, and V. Figure 5-25 explains these 
standards.
NPOV 
Neutral point of view: Content for Wikipedia articles 
should be phrased and presented in neutral language and 
with unbiased intent.
NOR 
No original research: Articles should be based on exist-
ing recognized knowledge. Personal views and original 
research are not appropriate.
RS
Reliable sources: The sources for Wikipedia content must 
conform to a set of guidelines designed to help contribu-
tors determine whether a source is acceptable.
V
Verifiability: Readers must be able to verify all content 
against credible external sources based on citations 
included within the text and listed at the conclusion.

The Internet offers many tools for communicating and collaborating; more 
are appearing every day. These tools can be classified into a four-cell matrix 
as shown in Figure 5-29.

	How are synchronous and asynchronous communications 
different? Think about email and Skype. You use them differently because 
one is synchronous and the other is asynchronous.
Synchronous. When communication is synchronous, interchanges hap-
pen in real time while all parties are online. Synchronous communications 
have the advantage of immediacy. They can convey your thoughts as you 
speak and events as they happen. Telephone calls are synchronous as are 
video conferences. 
Asynchronous. When communication is asynchronous, messages are 
held until the recipient is ready to view them. Asynchronous communication 
offers convenience because information can be gathered whenever you 
want it. That information can, however, be out of date by the time you obtain 
it. Email is an example of asynchronous communication.
	What is significant about public or private communications? 
There are times when you want to communicate with certain people, and 
there are times when you want to reach a wider audience. Networks offer 
opportunities for both public and private communications. 
Public. Public communications can be accessed by individuals unknown 
to the person who created a message. The word posting is associated with 
this type of communication because it is similar to posting a billboard, sign, 
or poster. Public communication platforms, such as Twitter and blogs, are 
useful for disseminating information to a wide audience.
Private. Communications for which you specify one or more recipients 
would be classified as private. Text messaging is a popular type of private 
communication. A limited audience can be an advantage or a disadvantage, 
depending on what you hope to accomplish with your message. Be aware, 
however, that private messages can be forwarded by recipients, so they do 
not necessarily remain private.

email
More than 250 billion email messages speed over the Internet each day. 
You can access email using Webmail or local mail, or both. Which system 
you use has implications for your security and privacy.
	Exactly what is email? The term email can refer to a single message 
or to the entire system of computers and software that transmits, receives, 
and stores email messages. An email message is an electronic document 
transmitted over a computer network. 
The computers and software that provide email services form an email sys-
tem. At the heart of a typical email system is an email server—a computer 
that essentially acts as a central post office for a group of people. Email serv-
ers run special email server software, which provides an electronic mailbox 
for each person, sorts incoming messages into these mailboxes, and routes 
outgoing mail over the Internet to other email servers. 
Email messages have a standard format that consists of a message header 
and the message body. The message header contains the sender and 
recipient addresses, date, and subject line. When you view an email mes-
sage, this information is a simplified version of a more complex header that 
contains a huge amount of routing information, which traces the path of the 
message and reveals how it was treated by various servers. If you want to 
know exactly where a message originated or why a message was returned 
to sender, check the header (Figure 5-30).
Figure 5-30: email message Headers
Header data shows the 
origin of the message 
and its route.
When using Gmail, click 
the More button and 
then select Show original.

	What are the pros and cons of Webmail? Webmail accounts are 
handy. They offer several advantages, but they also have a few disadvan-
tages that require consumer awareness. 
Affordable. Most Webmail is free. In addition to your primary account, you 
can establish additional accounts to use as throwaways for online activities 
that require registration, but that you don’t intend to continue using.
Access from mobile devices. Webmail can be accessed from mobile 
devices when your computer is not handy. If you opt to use mobile mail, 
be sure you understand how to sync your mobile account with the mail you 
view on your computer so that you don’t miss an important message. 
Access anywhere. Webmail is ideal for people who travel because mes-
sages can be accessed from any computer connected to the Internet. 
Security risks. Your email messages are stored on Web servers that 
can be targets for hackers and are monitored by government agencies. 
Accessing email from a public computer is handy when traveling, but it can 
be a security risk. To reduce the risk, you should:
• Reboot the computer before logging in to your email account. 
• Avoid entering sensitive information, such as your credit card number, in 
case your keystrokes are being monitored by malicious software lurking on 
the public computer. 
• Be sure to log off when your session is finished. 
• Log out and shut down the computer. 
Advertising. Free Webmail is supported by advertising, so expect to see 
advertisements. Today’s sophisticated ad servers can search the contents 
of an incoming message looking for keywords and then use them to display 
targeted ads in your browser window. 
	How does Webmail work? Webmail is typically a free service 
accessed using a browser. In a classic Webmail configuration, incoming 
messages are stored in an Inbox on the Web. When you want to read or 
send mail, use a browser to go to your email provider’s Web site and log 
in. The controls for reading, composing, and managing messages are all 
presented in the browser window. While reading and composing mail, you 
generally must remain online (Figure 5-31).
An email address is frequently 
used to verify your identity 
when subscribing to social 
media services. But that email 
address may easily fall into 
the hands of marketers. You 
can use a “junk” email address 
or work with a service such 
as 10 Minute Mail to obtain 
a temporary email address 
that lasts only long enough to 
subscribe to a service, receive 
the confirmation email, and 
click the verification link. Check

SECTION d, Unit 5
	How does local email work? When you use local email, an Internet-
based email server stores your incoming messages until you launch your 
email client and get your mail. Messages are then downloaded to a folder 
on a local storage device that serves as your email Inbox. This telecom-
munications technique is sometimes referred to as store-and-forward.
Using your email client, you can read your mail at your leisure. You can also 
compose new mail and reply to messages. This outgoing mail can be tem-
porarily stored in an Outbox or it can be sent immediately. 
The protocols POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) and IMAP (Internet 
Message Access Protocol) can be used to manage your incoming mail. 
POP3 deletes messages from the server after they are downloaded, 
whereas IMAP leaves messages on the server until you specifically delete 
them. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) handles outgoing mail. 
Keep these protocols in mind when setting up local email because the server 
you specify for outgoing mail might be different from the server for incoming 
mail (Figure 5-32). 
	What are the advantages of local email? Local email has the fol-
lowing advantages: 
Offline access. Because local email stores your Inbox and Outbox on 
your computer, you can compose and read mail offline. You are required to 
go online only to transfer outgoing mail from your Inbox to the email server, 
and to receive incoming messages. This feature is useful if you have a dial-
up connection or sporadic Internet access.
Control. When you use POP3 to collect your mail, your messages are 
transferred to your computer’s hard disk, where you can control who has 
access to them. With this control, however, comes the responsibility for 
maintaining backups of your important email messages.

	How do I set up local email? To set up local email, the first step 
is selecting a local email client. Macs include an email client called Mail. 
Microsoft Outlook is one of the most popular email clients for Windows. Its 
pared-down cousin, Windows Mail, can be downloaded for free as part of 
the Windows Essentials suite. 
After installing an email client, you can configure it for the email service 
you’re using. Your email provider can supply the information needed for this 
task. That information can include the following: 
• Your email user ID, which is the first part of your email address (for example, 
in AlexHamilton@gsu.edu, the user ID is AlexHamilton) 
• Your email password, if required to access the email server 
• An address for the outgoing (SMTP) server, such as mail.viserver.net or 
smtp.charter.com 
• An address for the incoming (POP3 or IMAP) server, such as mail.gsu.edu 
or pop.media.net 
• Port numbers for incoming and outgoing servers, which are usually Port 110 
(incoming) and Port 25 or 587 (outgoing)
• Whether the servers require secure authentication
• The type of connection security used by the servers: STARTTLS or SSL/
TLS 
Figure 5-33 displays basic information necessary to set up a local email 
account. 
The incoming server 
might have pop or mail 
as part of its name.
The outgoing server 
might have smtp as 
part of its name.

	Can I use both local email and Webmail? Yes. You can do any of 
the following:
Use local email software to access messages sent to your Webmail 
account. This approach is useful if you want to compose mail offline or if 
you prefer the interface of a local email client such as Outlook compared to 
the interface offered by Webmail services, such as Gmail. 
Using Gmail as an example, once you’ve created a Gmail account, you can 
access Settings to enable POP mail and then forward your mail to your local 
client (Figure 5-34). 
Figure 5-34: How to Forward Mail from Gmail to a Local Client
Use Webmail to collect messages from a POP server. This approach is 
useful if you have a local email account but don’t always have your com-
puter with you. Your local mail is copied to your Webmail account so it can 
be accessed when you log in to any computer with an Internet connection. 
Figure 5-35 demonstrates how to forward local mail to a Webmail account, 
using Gmail again as an example of a Webmail service and Media.net as 
the local POP3 account.

Online Chat
When email might take too long, and when you want to establish two-way 
communication, online chat services offer just the technology you need. The 
concept of shipping synchronous text, voice, or video over the Internet has 
its roots in instant messaging.
	What is instant messaging? Instant messaging (IM) is a synchro-
nous, real-time technology for two or more people to type messages back 
and forth while online. It has the vibe of a phone call except that instead of 
talking, the parties are typing. With some IM systems, both parties can see 
messages character by character as they are typed. More typically, how-
ever, the recipient does not see the message as it is typed, but rather must 
wait until it is completed.
Instant messaging technologies were available on local area networks even 
before the Internet was open to the public. As the Internet grew, online 
services, such as Yahoo!, MSN, AOL, and Excite, developed IM systems. 
Initially, all these systems were proprietary. This meant that messages 
could not be sent from one service’s IM client to a different service’s client. 
Eventually, some IM systems were able to interoperate. 
IM technology offers a degree of anonymity because typed messages have 
no associated voice or video. This anonymity led to the popularity of chat 
rooms, where individuals could discuss a variety of topics without fear of 
being identified and without necessarily taking responsibility for their state-
ments. 
Today, consumer preferences have shifted to audio and video commu-
nications platforms, but IM is still quite popular for customer service at 
ecommerce sites, where customers can ask questions about merchandise 
and services as well as get help and support (Figure 5-36).

Voice and Video Over IP
A soldier Skypes home from Afghanistan to spend a few precious moments 
talking with his spouse. A proud mom and dad use FaceTime to give the 
grandparents a first peek at a newborn baby. College students keep in 
touch from all over the globe without incurring long-distance charges. 
Communication today is far different from the handwritten letters and 
expensive long-distance telephone calls of 20th-century technology. 
	What is Voice over IP? VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) is a tech-
nology that uses a broadband Internet connection instead of PSTN land 
lines to place voice and video calls. Today’s VoIP systems use a variety 
of communication protocols. Some of these protocols are open standards, 
while others, such as those used by Skype, Google Talk, Snapchat, and 
FaceTime, are proprietary. Therefore, consumers have several options 
when choosing a system to install and use.
VoIP technologies are ideal for instant, synchronous communications, and 
video calls are currently “the next best thing to being there,” to borrow the 
tagline from old Bell telephone ads. VoIP is also the underlying technol-
ogy for business teleconferencing applications such as GoToMeeting and 
WebEx. 
Voice and video calls can be made between various devices, including lap-
tops, desktops, tablets, and smartphones. On mobile devices, VoIP uses 
the data stream, not the voice stream. Both the person initiating a call and 
the person receiving a call must use the same VoIP software and service. 
Skype-to-Vonage calls, for example, are not possible. Callers are generally 
online, but some services can route calls to land lines.
	How do today’s VoIP systems work? Software converts voice 
communications and video images into data packets using digitizing tech-
niques similar to those presented in Unit 1. 
An IP address is attached to each packet. If you are calling a friend with 
computer-based VoIP, for example, your friend’s IP address will be attached 
to the packets. If you are calling a land line or other destination without its 
own IP address, your VoIP packets will carry an IP address of a service that 
can route your packets to their destination using land lines or cell towers 
where necessary (Figure 5-37).

	What is significant about Snapchat? A mobile app called Snapchat 
allows consumers to send and receive photo and video messages referred 
to as “snaps.” Senders can specify the period of time during which recipients 
are permitted to view a snap. Once a snap is viewed, it disappears from the 
recipient’s device and is deleted from the Snapchat servers. Snaps that go 
unviewed for more than 30 days are also deleted from the servers. After 
a snap is viewed, it “disappears forever”—or that is what the developers 
claimed. 
In reality, several methods exist for accessing snaps and viewing them 
indefinitely. Consumers who send images meant to disappear after a short 
viewing period may be dismayed to discover that their snaps can be saved, 
copied, and even posted to social media sites. 
In 2014, the FTC filed a complaint against Snapchat for deceptive acts and 
practices. To settle the complaint, Snapchat agreed to discontinue deceptive 
advertising and take steps to enhance user privacy. The Snapchat site now 
warns: “...you might know that with the right forensic tools, it’s sometimes 
possible to retrieve data after it has been deleted. So…you know…keep that 
in mind before putting any state secrets in your selfies :)”.
Snapchat is fun to use (Figure 5-38), but the controversy surrounding its 
FTC settlement illustrates the need to exercise caution when posting to 
social media sites.

Take a quick look at your 
Facebook friends and your 
contacts on other social media 
platforms. Do most of them use 
their real names? 
Identity
Self-identity is the way we view and define ourselves as unique individuals. 
That identity, however, may not be the one we strive to project in our social 
media profiles. Some scholars worry that social media encourage individu-
als to construct facades that depict identities they hope are acceptable to 
others, rather than identities that reflect who they really are. But you should 
exercise caution when constructing an online identity because social media 
personas are so globally public. Creating an online profile that reflects your 
identity requires careful attention.
	What constitutes a social media identity? An online identity 
consists of far more than a photo and a brief autobiographical sketch. The 
elements that constitute a social media identity include a biographical pro-
file, the set of people who form connections, and the information supplied 
as posts. All these elements create a social media identity and also offer 
clues to an individual’s offline identity. 
	How important are first impressions? Whether you’re connect-
ing with former classmates, collaborating with colleagues, or climbing the 
career ladder, people looking for you online first encounter your social 
media profile—and the impression it conveys influences subsequent inter-
actions. For example, a user name carries lots of information. A familiar 
name can convey a favorable first impression, whereas a whacky pseud-
onym might be a turnoff. 
	How prevalent are pseudonyms? The terms of use policies for 
some social media services require participants to use their real names, 
whereas other services permit pseudonyms. Regardless of the terms 
of service, online identities are not always genuine, and it is important 
to remain aware of that fact. User names such as BumbleBee532 and 
CrossWalkTrekker are obviously pseudonyms. But user names such as 
BillGWillis or ShenikaLouisaEspinosa that seem legitimate also could be 
fakes. 
By some estimates, nearly 40% of all online identities are fake. Not only do 
some people prefer not to use their real names, spammers control armies 
of fake avatars that want to be your friends so they can carry out a vari-
ety of identity exploits. False identities are used for nefarious purposes by 
cyberbullies, criminals, and stalkers. The use of sockpuppets—any online 
identity created and used for purposes of deception— is widespread (Figure 
5-39).

SECTION e, Unit 5
	What about anonymity? The principle of anonymity was expressed 
by Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens: “Anonymity is a shield from 
the tyranny of the majority. It thus exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of 
Rights, and of the First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular indi-
viduals from retaliation—and their ideas from suppression—at the hand of 
an intolerant society.” 
There are legitimate reasons for people to conceal their identities. Political 
dissidents, victims of abuse, and corporate whistleblowers, for example, 
may not be able to safely interact online under their real names. However, 
with a little detective work on the contents of posts, photo locations, and IP 
addresses, real identities can be all too easily uncovered.
If you decide to conceal your offline identity by using an online pseudonym, 
be careful not to tread on someone else’s legitimate identity.
	How significant is a profile photo? Most social media sites pro-
vide a generic profile image for users who do not upload a personal photo. 
Users who retain the generic image tend to be newcomers or spammers. 
Members of online communities may ignore friend requests and comments 
that come from accounts without a custom image. Figure 5-40 lists some 
things to consider when selecting a profile image.
	What does a tagline reveal? Most social media profiles include a 
short, publicly viewable tagline. In LinkedIn, this tagline is called a Headline; 
on Facebook, it is called Details About You. Along with the user’s photo, a 
tagline establishes the first impression of an online persona. Taglines not 
only reveal biographical information, but also can offer insights into a per-
son’s personality. Taglines are not dependable, however. They can be total 
fiction.
When creating a tagline, be aware that it is part of your public first impres-
sion. Consider your wording carefully. Tailor it to the site and to your 
audience, but give it some personality to convey your uniqueness.
	What about detailed biographical information? Detailed bio-
graphical information is generally viewable only by designated connections, 
depending on the user’s privacy settings. Biographical information can 
include details about a person’s education, work experience, residences, 
family, skills, expertise, and volunteer work. Providing these details helps 
the social media service to recommend groups or individuals with similar 
interests. This information can also be abused by advertisers and identity 
thieves, so be cautious about the information you reveal.

Reputation
When a prospective employer asks for access to your social media 
accounts, is it time to panic, or do you have a well-managed set of sites 
that you don’t hesitate to share with the world? “Starting today you are a 
brand.” That is the advice of Tom Peters, author of In Search of Excellence. 
Nowhere is this statement more true than online. Your online identity 
requires careful nurturing and constant vigilance. Maintaining your online 
reputation ensures that it is an accurate reflection of your offline identity as 
well as your online presence.
	How important are online reputations? An online reputation is 
the impression that is generated by an online persona. It relates to the way 
others perceive a person’s online identity, as opposed to the way in which a 
person defines himself or herself.
An individual’s online reputation may be used to evaluate whether to accept 
friend requests and whether a person’s tweets are worth following. It can 
also help to gauge the authority of a person’s comments, ratings, and posts. 
Online reputations can affect real life. A good online reputation can lead 
to job offers, collaborative projects, and other opportunities. A bad online 
reputation can have disastrous consequences. Examples pepper the 
digital landscape. A job applicant’s embarrassing spring break photos on 
Classmates.com. A high school student’s Facebook page defaced by cyber-
bullies. An offensive tweet made by a high profile athlete. Inappropriate 
photos sent as text messages by a prominent politician.
	What can ruin an online reputation? According to executive 
coach Steve Tobak, “Everything you do on the Internet is like a tattoo you 
get late at night that can never ever be erased.” Many factors can have a 
negative effect on an individual’s online reputation.
Mistakes. An individual may inadvertently post messages, comments, 
photos, or personal details that are incorrect or unwise, or can be misin-
terpreted. Such posts can affect public opinion by damaging the poster’s 
reputation.
Defamation. Communicating false statements that damage the reputation 
of another individual is referred to as defamation. In most countries, defa-
mation is illegal.
Cyberbullying. Using information technology, such as the Internet, to 
deliberately harm or harass someone is called cyberbullying. The intent 
of cyberbullying is often to damage the reputation of the targeted per-
son. Recommended techniques for dealing with cyberbullying include not 
responding, deleting posts, blocking the perpetrator, and saving screen-
shots in case you decide to notify authorities.
Impersonation. Deliberately using the name or avatar of another person 
without his or her consent and with the intent to harm, defraud, or intimidate 
is called impersonation. Impersonators can carry out reputation-damaging 
activities, such as posting inflammatory comments. 
Doppelgangers. Online doppelgangers are two or more online perso-
nas with the same name or user name. The personas of doppelgangers 
are sometimes mistaken for each other, and their reputations may become 
intertwined.

Use Google to search for your 
name. Try entering your first and 
last names, then enter your first, 
middle, and last names. Do you

SECTION e, Unit 5
	What factors contribute to a person’s online reputation? 
Online reputation encompasses many factors that affect the perception of 
an online identity. It includes the user profile, list of friends, list of followers, 
posts, comments, mentions, photo tags, and blog entries at social media 
sites. It also includes personal Web sites, Web pages, publications, and 
other original works that may exist online. Further, it may include data that 
tracks online activity, such as purchases and downloads.
Some of the data that contributes to an online reputation is created and 
managed by the person who controls the online persona. Other data is 
posted by friends and connections. Yet other data, such as credit scores 
and shopping activity, is compiled by third parties. Figure 5-41 summarizes 
the elements of an online reputation.
Figure 5-41: Anatomy of an OnLine Reputation
User Profile 
Profiles may explicitly state 
a reputation, such as “avid 
skier” or “award-winning 
author.”
Media Presence 
Elements of an online 
reputation are derived 
from multiple sources, so 
it includes social media 
accounts, blogs, and Web 
sites. 
Posts 
Words, pictures, and videos 
that individuals post about 
themselves are evaluated by 
others to form an impres-
sion that becomes an online 
reputation.
Comments 
The comments that individu-
als append to other peoples’ 
posts, tweets, and blogs 
contribute to building a 
reputation within the group 
of participants.
Images 
Whether posted by you or 
by others, images provide 
clues about a person’s age, 
ethnicity, personality, and 
lifestyle. Viewers form 
opinions based on those 
images.
Contacts
People tend to interact 
with those who share their 
interests. An individual’s 
contacts and group associa-
tions contribute to the way 
that individual is regarded 
by others.
Google Results 
When someone uses Google 
to search for an individual, 
the first page of search 
results forms an impression 
that may be perceived as 
the individual’s reputation.
Expertise 
Many reputations are built 
on knowledge and expertise 
that are displayed in various 
online forums, social media, 
and offline sources.
Popularity 
The popularity of blogs 
and Web sites as measured 
by Alexa and other rating 
services indicate a person’s 
relevancy.

	What are best practices for managing online reputations? 
The key to managing your online reputation is vigilance. Just as you learn 
to use social media tools for connecting to friends and colleagues, it is 
important to learn how to use the evolving set of tools for understanding and 
managing your online reputation. Figure 5-42 explains the basic tools and 
techniques for reputation management.

Which of the items listed in 
Figure 5-42 are most likely 
to help improve your online 
reputation?
 
Cultivate your roster of friends. Don’t be tempted to bump up your 
numbers by accepting invitations from random avatars operated by 
spammers.
Search for your name and make note of any results that might damage 
your reputation.
Use Google Alerts to keep informed of information that is posted about 
you.
Adjust settings within your social media accounts so that you are notified 
when you are tagged in photos and videos.
Don’t let your online identities languish. Add posts regularly.
Check all your social media sites periodically to make sure they have not 
been compromised by identity thieves.
Maintain a consistent user name and identity across sites—especially 
those that are open to the public.
Remove posts, comments, photos, and blog entries that don’t portray 
your desired online image.
Push enough positive information to the top of your Google search 
results to obscure any negative content that relates to you.
Separate your professional sites from your personal sites and keep posts 
appropriate to each.
Consider buying domain names that contain your real name.
Establish accounts on all the popular social media sites so that others 
cannot impersonate you there.
Maintain civil discourse. Democracies promote free speech, but there are 
legal and cultural limits. You must be alert, within all of your networking 
circles, for the norms regarding speech that is acceptable and speech that 
is not.

SECTION e, Unit 5
Privacy
It was 1890, and journalists using a new technology called photography 
were snapping sensationalistic photos and publishing them without the 
consent of the photo subjects. This breach of ethics prompted two young 
attorneys to call for laws that would keep pace with new technology. One of 
these attorneys was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1916. Justice Louis 
Brandeis became a staunch defender of privacy rights and defined the legal 
precedents for today’s privacy laws.
	Exactly what is the right to privacy? In the words of Justice 
Brandeis, privacy is the “right to be let alone.” Commonly held expectations 
of privacy include freedom from intrusive surveillance and the expectation 
that individuals can control their own personally identifiable information 
(PII) to limit when they can be identified, tracked, or contacted. 
Privacy is different from security, though the two overlap. Security refers to 
the way we protect ourselves and our property. Privacy is our ability to con-
trol access to our personal information and activities. Security is the lock on 
your front door. Privacy is the curtains on your bedroom window. 
	Why is privacy important? You may think that you have nothing to 
hide and so privacy rights are unimportant. You may be happy to share the 
details of your life with friends and even with the general public. But ask 
yourself this: Would you be willing to give your social media passwords 
to any stranger who asked for them? If you answered no, then privacy is 
important to you. 
It is somewhat ironic, however, that you need a password to access your 
social media accounts, but the information they hold can be accessed 
without passwords by marketing agencies, third-party app developers, gov-
ernment agencies, and various data collection programs. 
Although the United States Constitution does not explicitly define privacy as 
a right, wording in that document infers the importance of privacy. According 
to many legal scholars, the importance of privacy goes beyond individual 
rights and is a foundational concept of freedom and democracy. 
In the Harvard Law Review article “What Privacy is For,” Julie E. Cohen 
states: “...privacy is an indispensable structural feature of liberal democratic 
political systems. Freedom from surveillance, whether public or private, is 
foundational to the capacity for critical self-reflection and informed citizenship. 
Second, privacy is also foundational to the capacity for innovation.... A society 
that values innovation ignores privacy at its peril, for privacy also shelters the 
processes of play and experimentation from which innovation emerges.”
	What is a privacy policy? Most social media services have a writ-
ten privacy policy that states how PII data is handled, including how it is 
accessed and how long it is stored. Privacy policies can be several pages 
long, and they are worth reading to discover if your expectations of privacy 
correspond to the privacy protections offered by the service. Even if you 
don’t read the entire policy, try to determine how your data may be used by 
third parties such as advertisers. Also check to see if your posts, photos, 
and other media remain your own, or if they become the property of the 
social media service.
Privacy policies change, and the changes usually offer fewer privacy protec-
tions. When you receive a privacy policy change notification, check your 
account settings. As a result of changes, data that was previously private 
may have become public.

	Where can users access privacy settings? Privacy settings are 
usually included along with general account settings and accessed from 
the menu bar or account icon. Figure 5-43 illustrates privacy settings avail-
able for Facebook users. 
	Are there levels of privacy? Some data is suitable for general pub-
lication, while other data is suitable for colleagues. Yet another set of data 
may be suitable for friends, while some data is confidential. Key steps in 
maintaining online privacy include awareness of the different types of data 
collected by social media services and the level of privacy appropriate for 
each type. Computer security expert Bruce Schneier devised the taxonomy 
of social media data in Figure 5-44.
Service data 
The data you give to a social media service when register-
ing to use it. Such data might include your legal name, your 
age, and your credit-card number.
Disclosed data 
Information that you post on your own pages. Such infor-
mation can include blog entries, photos, messages, and 
comments.
Entrusted 
data 
Information that you post on other people’s pages. This 
information includes the same items as disclosed data, but 
you don’t have control over the data once you post it.
Incidental 
data 
Information that other people post about you. As with 
entrusted data, you do not have control over it.
Behavioral 
data 
Data about you that is collected by the social media service 
based on your habits, site usage, post contents, and con-
nections. 
Derived data 
Data about you that is derived from all the other data. For 
example, if lots of your friends self-identify as gay, your 
derived data might profile you as gay, too.

Section E, Unit 5
	How does personal information go rogue? Data “gone rogue” 
escapes its appropriate privacy setting and somehow goes public. An item 
of PII such as a photograph or a Facebook post can become publicly acces-
sible when users explicitly make it so, either by choice or by mistake. PII can 
also become public through the actions of others. The most common causes 
of rogue data include:
• A user changes his or her global privacy setting to Public.
• A user designates an item as public when it is posted.
• Changes in the social media service’s privacy policy result in previously pri-
vate information becoming public.
• A user ignores changes in the social media service’s privacy policy. 
• Posted information is reposted publicly.
• Third-party social networking applications redistribute information collected 
as the user works with an app.
	How risky are social media apps? Third-party apps are external 
programs that interact with social networking services. Third-party games 
such as Diamond Dash allow you to share your winnings with Facebook 
friends. Quizzes from third-party developers such as BuzzFeed make it 
easy to post results on Twitter and get instant feedback from followers.
Hundreds of third-party social media apps are available, and they have one 
thing in common: All of them collect information from social media profiles, 
including contact lists.
The following aspects of third-party apps may affect your privacy:
• Collected data might not be transmitted over secure channels.
• An excessive amount of personal data could be collected.
• Data about your contacts might be collected.
• The collected data may not be subject to the same privacy policies as the 
social networking service it accesses. 
The amount of information accessed by third-party apps depends on your 
privacy settings and the access you grant when signing up to use the app 
(Figure 5-45).

Issue: When do online avatars die?
30 million. That’s the number of Facebook 
users who died during the service’s first eight years 
in operation. The number of deceased Facebook 
members is projected to outnumber its living avatars 
by 2030. Have you ever wondered what happens to 
online avatars when their owners pass away?
Consider the 2011 case of a 15-year-old high 
school student in Virginia who tragically committed 
suicide. His parents wanted to access their son’s 
social media accounts to look for clues that might 
explain his motivation. Their request 
for access was denied. Facebook’s 
denial was based on state statutes, 
federal laws, and language in the 
1986 Electronic Communications 
Privacy Act that protects the privacy 
of minors.
As a result of the ensuing contro-
versy, the Virginia Legislature passed 
HB 1752, or the Virginia Digital Assets Law. This 
law allows parents or legal guardians of minors 
to access their childrens’ social media accounts. 
According to the official summary, this bill “Provides 
that the personal representative of a deceased 
minor has the power to assume the deceased 
minor’s terms of service agreement with an Internet 
service provider, communications service provider, 
or other online account service provider for the pur-
poses of consenting to and obtaining the disclosure 
of the minor’s digital assets.”
The Virginia law focuses on the rights of minors and 
their parents, but who has rights to an adult’s digital 
data after his or her death? 
The estate of a deceased person includes personal 
effects such as clothing and household implements. 
It may also include financial assets and real estate. 
An executor is an individual whose responsibility 
is to dispose of these personal effects. The abil-
ity of an executor to access the digital assets of a 
deceased person depends on a myriad of state and 
federal laws as well as the policies of various social 
media services. The terms of use for most social 
media sites are nontransferable, which means that 
account access and use cannot be transferred from 
a deceased person to an executor.
The images and posts on social media sites are 
just a fraction of the many digital assets that peo-
ple accumulate throughout their lives. Other digital 
assets include accounts for email, online banking, 
bill paying, and medical records. 
Each category of assets has different implications 
for an individual’s privacy rights, which legally 
remain in effect after death. 
Processes and procedures exist for releasing bank 
accounts and similar financial assets to an execu-
tor. However, purely online financial 
holdings such as bitcoin and PayPal 
accounts may be more difficult to 
access, as the executor must prove 
his or her credentials digitally rather 
than in person.
E m a i l  a c c o u n t s ,  w h i c h  h o l d 
correspondence with multiple individ-
uals, are even further complicated. 
Messages from correspondents were sent with an 
expectation of privacy. Neither the sender nor the 
recipient may want the executor rifling through old 
love letters, complaints, or messages that might 
have repercussions on their reputations.
As with other aspects surrounding estate planning, 
a fully executed will is the key to ensuring that real 
and digital assets are handled in a specific way and 
by specified people. Some people may wish their 
online avatars to live forever, whereas others may 
wish to exercise their right to be forgotten. 
Facebook will now memorialize deceased mem-
bers’ accounts when provided with proof of death. 
A memorialized account cannot be modified and 
logins are not allowed. The account can, however, 
accept messages and content that was posted, 
before the account holder’s demise continues to be 
accessible.
Individuals may not live forever, but their social 
media avatars can continue to exist in cyberspace. 
Online identities can be frozen in time, surrounded 
by posts and images accumulated over a lifetime 
and now set as a permanent, unalterable record of 
a person’s activities, friends, and accomplishments. 
It makes you think: What kind of digital legacy are 
you leaving behind?
“Do you want 
to live forever?”

1. Have you ever thought about what happens to the social media 
accounts of people who are deceased?
2. Do you know who might have access to your social media accounts if 
you meet an untimely death?
3. Are memorialized accounts a good idea? 
What Do You Think?
 ISSUE
TRY IT! Who can paw through your digital belongings after you 
die? There’s never a good time to think about your demise, but no one is 
immortal. Keeping an eye on your digital reputation includes specifying your 
wishes for the disposition of your digital assets even after you are no longer 
around to manage them.
	 Visit one of the social networking sites that you frequently use. Search 
for its policy about access to the accounts of deceased members. 
Briefly describe the policy and explain if you are satisfied with its 
terms. If the site offers user-modifiable settings, are the default set-
tings appropriate or would you choose to change the settings?
	 Use Google to search for online resources about digital death and 
digital afterlife, or view the resources at www.thedigitalbeyond.com/
online-services-list/. Some of the services are a little strange such as 
the crowd-funded b-emortal.com, which aims to provide an everlasting 
memorial for loved ones that includes, for a small fee, a photo and a 
reading of the person’s name annually for the rest of time. The idea is 
that you don’t really die until you are forgotten. List and briefly describe 
two other online digital death resources that you were surprised to find.
	 Visit www.digitalpassing.com and search for List of State Laws. Find 
your state in the list, and read its associated laws and proposals. 
Read about your state’s policy regarding digital property in the event 
of death. Write a brief summary of the laws and/or proposals in your 
state.
	 One of the first things that you can do when creating your own digital 
legacy is to compile a list of your digital assets and accounts. Visit 
www.funeralwise.com/learn/digitallegacy/ to get some tips on how to 
accurately compile your own list. Then, make a list of your own digi-
tal accounts. You don’t need to be specific, but you should mention 
general accounts such as online banking, social media, email, smart-
phone, and computers.
	 Document how you want your online accounts handled in the event of 
your own death, and decide who will handle your accounts. Also think 
about and determine a place where you would store your list of digital 
accounts and assets, including who and how your accounts should be 
handled.

You can easily copy music, photos, and video clips for use in reports, on 
your blog, on YouTube, and on your Facebook page. If you are not creating 
a transformative work or a critical work that would be covered by fair use, 
what steps must you take to use “borrowed” content correctly?
As a general rule, assume that all images and media are copyrighted. 
Media elements on the Web are covered by the same copyrights as works 
in print and in other formats. When using copyrighted media, you should 
seek permission and provide attribution that identifies the copyright holder. 
Permission and attribution are not the same: 
• Permission means obtaining rights for a specific use, such as on a 
Web site. 
• Attribution means acknowledging the person who holds the copy-
right, usually by including a tagline under a media element or a 
citation in a bibliography. 
You can obtain permission by asking the copyright holder. Most 
media sharing sites provide links to copyright holders. Supply the 
copyright holder with information about the item you want to use 
and how you intend to use it. 
You might not have to contact the copyright holder for permission if 
the media element is covered by a license. Look for a license or rights 
link near the media element or a site-use policy near the bottom of a 
Web page.
You can place your photo attribution in a small font directly under the photo 
or on its side, or you can include it in the bibliography. Video and music attri-
butions should be placed near the “Play” link or in a bibliography.
The copyright holder might specify the text you should use for the attribution 
(e.g., “Courtesy of IBM” or “Jerry Harris Photography”).
If the wording for an attribution is not specified, then you should include the 
following:
• Copyright holder’s name 
• License type, such as “with permission” or “Creative Commons”
• URL (optional)
The easiest media elements to use legally have a Creative Commons 
license for Attribution (BY). 
These licenses clearly specify whether the element can be used for per-
sonal or commercial use, and they only require you to provide an attribution 
crediting the source.

Technology in Context: Journalism
In the ancient world, news spread 
by word of mouth, relayed by bards and merchants 
who traveled from town to town—in essence, they 
were the first reporters to broadcast the news. The 
news business is all about gathering and dissemi-
nating information quickly. Technology has played 
a major role in news reporting’s evolution from its 
bardic roots to modern 24-hour news networks and 
Web sites. 
Johann Gutenberg’s printing press (ca. 1450), the 
first technological breakthrough in the news busi-
ness, made it feasible to publish news as printed 
notices tacked to walls in the town square. As paper 
became more economical, resourceful entrepreneurs 
sold broadsheets to people eager for news, and the 
concept of a newspaper was born. The first regularly 
published newspapers appeared in Germany and 
Holland in 1609, and the first English newspaper, the 
Weekly News, was published in 1622.
But the news spread slowly. In the early 1800s, 
it took four weeks for newspapers in New York to 
receive reports from London. With the advent of the 
telegraph in 1844, however, reporters from far-flung 
regions could wire stories to their newspapers for 
publication the next day. The first radio reporters in 
the 1920s offered live broadcasts of sports events, 
church services, and variety shows. Before the 
1950s, black-and-white newsreels shown in movie 
theaters provided the only visual imagery of news 
events, but television gave viewers news images on 
a nightly basis.
Technology has benefited print journalism, too. For 
decades, typesetters transferred reporters’ handwrit-
ten stories into neatly set columns of type. Today, 
reporters use computers and word processing soft-
ware to tap out their stories and run a preliminary 
check of spelling and grammar. 
Stories are submitted by computer network to editors, 
who also use word processing software to edit sto-
ries to fit time and space constraints. The typesetting 
process has been replaced by desktop publishing 
software and computer to plate (CTP) technology. 
Digital pages produced with desktop publishing soft-
ware are sent to a raster image processor (RIP), 
which converts the pages into dots that form words 
and images. After a page has been RIPed, a plate-
setter uses lasers to etch the dots onto a physical 
plate, which is then mounted on the printing press to 
produce printed pages. CTP is much faster and more 
flexible than typesetting, so publishers can make 
last-minute changes to accommodate late-breaking 
stories. 
Personal computers have also added a new dimen-
sion to the news-gathering process. Reporters were 
once limited to personal interviews, observation, and 
fact gathering at libraries, but they can now make 
extensive use of Internet resources and email. Web 
sites and online databases provide background 
information on all sorts of topics. Other resources 
include social media, where reporters can monitor 
public opinion on current events and identify potential 
sources. 
Most major networks maintain interactive Web sites 
that offer online polls and bulletin boards designed 
to collect viewers’ opinions. Although online poll 
respondents are not a representative sample of the 
population, they can help news organizations gauge 
viewer opinions and determine whether news cover-
age is comprehensive and effective. 
A 2014 study from the Indiana University School of 
Journalism identified microblogs such as Twitter as 
the most popular type of social media used by jour-
nalists. Watching Twitter trends helps journalists stay 
on top of breaking events, supplies information on 
the competition’s reporting, and provides journalists 
with ideas for news stories.

Social Media

Email has changed the way reporters communi-
cate with colleagues and sources. It’s often the only 
practical method for contacting people in remote 
locations or distant time zones, and it’s useful for 
communicating with reluctant sources, who feel 
more comfortable providing information under the 
cloak of anonymous Gmail or Yahoo! accounts. 
Vetting email sources—verifying credentials such 
as name, location, and occupation—can be diffi-
cult, however, so reporters tend not to rely on these 
sources without substantial corroboration.
For broadcast journalism, digital communications 
play a major role in today’s live, “on the scene” tele-
vision reporting. Most news organizations maintain 
remote production vans, sometimes called satellite 
news gathering (SNG) trucks, that travel to the site 
of breaking news, raise their antennas, and begin to 
broadcast. These complete mobile production facili-
ties include camera control units, audio and video 
recording equipment, and satellite or microwave 
transmitters. 
A memorable tour de force in SNG was the brainchild 
of David Bloom, an NBC reporter embedded with the 
U.S. Army 3rd Infantry Division during Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. He helped modify an M-88 tank recovery 
vehicle into a high-tech, armored SNG vehicle. The 
$500,000 Bloommobile featured a gyrostabilized 
camera that could produce jiggle-free video as the 
tank blasted over sand dunes at 50 mph. Tragically, 
Bloom died while covering the conflict. However, 
viewers vividly remember his exhilarating reports 
as the Bloommobile raced down desert roads, trun-
dled along with Army supply convoys, and narrowly 
escaped enemy fire. 
On-the-scene reporting no longer requires a truck 
full of equipment, however. Citizen journalists who 
are on the spot during news-making events simply 
use their smartphones to shoot and email footage to 
media Web sites, such as CNN.com and FOXNews.
com. During the tragic 2008 terrorist attacks 
in Mumbai, eyewitness accounts and updates 
flooded social networking sites such as Facebook 
and Twitter. The first images of the attacks spread 
through social networking sites minutes before they 
appeared on mainstream news channels.
One drawback of point-and-shoot journalism is that 
the video quality usually isn’t as crisp as images 
filmed with studio cameras. News organizations with 
high standards were once hesitant to use this lower 
quality video, but they have found that viewers would 
rather see a low-quality image now than a high-qual-
ity image later. To many viewers, a few rough edges 
just make the footage seem more compelling—more 
like you are there.
Social media have radically altered the financial 
models that support news organizations. Newspaper 
readership is in steep decline while revenue from 
advertising is also dropping. News organizations 
attempting to move online are forced to compete with 
free news gathered by automated aggregators such 
as Google News and online news sites including The 
Huffington Post and Slashdot.
The financial crush has had a devastating effect 
on newsroom jobs. Journalism graduates face a 
tough job market as news organizations scramble 
to restructure their business models. Today, many 
journalism graduates are finding employment at 
online startups and in related industries that require 
research and intelligence-gathering skills. 
Computers, the Internet, and communications tech-
nology make it possible to instantly broadcast live 
reports across the globe, but live reporting is not 
without controversy. Reporters and amateur jour-
nalists who arrive at the scene of a disaster with 
microphones, cameras, or smartphones in hand have 
little time for reflection, vetting, and cross-checking, 
so grievous errors, libelous images, and distasteful 
video footage sometimes find their way into news 
reports.
According to Jeff Gralnick, former executive pro-
ducer for ABC News, “In the old days, we had time 
to think before we spoke. We had time to write, time 
to research and time to say, ‘Hey, wait a minute.’ 
Now we don’t even have the time to say, ‘Hey, wait 
a nanosecond.’ Just because we can say it or do it, 
should we?” Technology has given journalists a pow-
erful arsenal of tools for gathering and reporting the 
news, but it has also increased their accountability 
for accurate, socially responsible reporting.

Unit 5
Critical Thinking
There’s a cartoon that has become a social media 
meme. Two pigs are chatting. The first pig says, 
“Isn’t it great? We have to pay nothing for the barn.” 
The second pig replies, “Yeah! And even the food 
is free.” This cartoon is frequently linked to a quote 
that goes something like this: “If you’re not paying 
for it, you’re not the customer; you’re the product 
being sold.” What do these statements imply about 
social media? What are specific ways that social 
media users become a product that is being sold?
Group Project
Work with a group of three or four students to 
research a new social media service. If possible, 
install it on your devices and try it out. On the basis 
of your trial run, make a list of the service’s advan-
tages and where there is room for improvement. 
Discuss the target audience for the service and 
how easy the service is to use. Also consider if use 
of the site poses privacy concerns. Collaborate with 
your group to write a review of the service that you 
can present to the rest of the class.
Cyberclassroom
In a small group, discuss the use of social media as 
a tool in education, specifically thinking about how 
it can be used effectively for on-campus students. 
Is its best use for communication or instruction? 
Can you share personal experiences when social 
media have been used effectively or examples of 
attempts to use it that have fallen short? 
Multimedia Project
Create an original work, such as a photo, video, 
or audio track. Select a Creative Commons license 
for the work using the license chooser located at 
creativecommons.org/choose. Post the image 
along with its license on a social media site.
Resume Builder
LinkedIn is the leading social media service for 
building a professional online image. If you don’t 
have a LinkedIn account, sign up for one and begin 
building a profile. If you already have a LinkedIn 
account, revisit it, consider the information you’ve 
collected from this unit, and revise your profile as 
necessary.
Globalization
Social media are used across cultures, but the 
specific sites that rank highest differ by country 
and region. Search the Web for usage statistics for 
social networking sites. What are the most popu-
lar services in the United States, England, and 
Australia? Which services are most popular in 
Japan, China, South Korea, and India? Can you 
find the services that are most popular in Russia 
and in Middle Eastern countries? Based on the 
information you find, what can you conclude about 
social media usage differences around the world? 
Gather statistics and create a graph to support your 
conclusions.

Interactive Summary
3 6 4 	
Unit 5
SECTION A: Social media are online services that facili-
tate communication and 
 among 
people who want to share information about their lives, issues, 
and events. Social media can be characterized using the Social 
Media 
 containing elements such as 
identity and presence. Social networking is a type of social media 
that revolves around personal 
 and 
interconnections among contacts, friends, and followers. Social 
networks evolved from online 
 
such as CompuServe and American Online. A person’s pres-
ence on a social media service is referred to as an online 
identity. 
 networking services 
provide a platform for users to carry out interactions based on 
their current locations. Many of these services incorporate 
 features for reviews and ratings. 
User locations can be determined by 
 
trilateration, cell tower triangulation, hotspot triangulation, 
and IP address lookup. Destination locations are identified by
 or geocoding. Social networks can 
be mapped using tools such as 
 that 
depict relationships as nodes and edges. Another useful tool 
called an adjacency 
 depicts social 
relationships in table format.
SECTION B: Content communities are social media sites 
that focus on sharing user-
 content. These 
communities originated as pre-Internet 
 
board systems. Media content communities specialize in images, 
videos, animations, and audio rather than text-based content. 
The technological core of content communities is server-based 
content 
 software and an associated data-
base. Once media is posted to a server, it may remain in the 
database indefinitely. To facilitate indexing, identification, and 
searching, content can be assigned 
 tags. 
Media elements are the 
 property of their 
creators and are protected by patents, trademarks, copyrights, 
and trade secrets. Some media, such as a corporate logo, are 
protected by 
 , but most of the media at 
content communities are protected by copyright. Copyright is 
a form of legal protection that grants the author of an original 
work a(n) 
 right to copy, distribute, sell, 
and modify that work. A copyright holder can forfeit the copy-
right and place the work in the public 
 . A 
copyright holder can also choose to license the work. A Creative 
 license allows a work to be used by 
others under specified conditions that include attribution (BY), 
 (SA), no derivatives (ND), and noncom-
mercial (NC). A(n) 
 work modifies a copy-
righted work but does not substantially change its content or 
purpose. A(n) 
 work repackages a work to 
add new meaning or produce a work that is used for a purpose 
different from the original work.

SOCIAL MEDIA

SECTION C: Text-based content communities form 
around blogging and wiki platforms. A(n) 
 
is similar to an online diary. It contains a series of entries on 
one or more topics and may include photos or other media. 
Subscription services make it easy to follow specific blogs, 
and 
 readers help to monitor the latest 
posts on a series of blogs. The information published on blogs 
may not be as reliable as mainstream information sources. 
 services, such as Twitter, offer a platform 
for messages similar to blogs but with limited length. Tweets, 
for example, are limited to 140 characters. Twitter jargon has 
infiltrated into other social media platforms. For example, the 
 symbol is universally used to identify 
and tag topics, whereas the 
 symbol 
is used to indicate user names in mentions and replies. A(n) 
 is a collaborative Web application that 
provides tools that contributors can use to post, read, and modify 
content. The most well-known example is Wikipedia, an online 
 that can be accessed, viewed, and edited 
anonymously by the general public. To maintain quality stan-
dards, Wikipedia is supervised by volunteer editors who encour-
age 
 point of view, no original research, 
reliable sources, and verifiability.
SECTION D: Online communications tools can be classi-
fied as 
 , in which all parties are online at 
the same time, and 
 , in which messages 
are held until the recipient is ready to view them. Communication 
can also be characterized as public or private. Email is a com-
munication service provided by email servers that provide an 
electronic 
 for each subscriber, sort 
incoming messages, and route outgoing messages to recipients. 
 is a type of email service that stores mes-
sages on a server and uses a browser to access those mes-
sages. Using a browser to access mail is handy, but doing so may 
pose security risks when mail is accessed from public comput-
ers. Local mail is a store-and-
 technology 
that holds messages on a server until they are downloaded by 
email client software such as Microsoft Outlook. Local mail uses 
IMAP or 
 protocols to manage incoming 
mail and 
 to manage outgoing mail. Local 
mail and Webmail can be used interchangeably when appropri-
ate forwarding settings are enabled. Synchronous text-based 
communication characterizes instant 
 and 
online chat. Synchronous voice and video communications are 
handled by 
 technologies on platforms 
such as Skype, Google Talk, Snapchat, and FaceTime.
SECTION E: An online 
 is a col-
lection of elements that reflect an individual’s self-perception. 
The core of that identity is an online 
 that 
commonly consists of a user name, image, and short biographi-
cal tagline. The use of 
 as user names is 
widespread, though it is banned on some social media sites. An 
online 
 is the impression that is generated 
by an online persona. It relates to the way that others perceive an 
online identity. Factors such as mistakes, defamation, cyberbul-
lying, impersonation, and the existence of doppelgangers have 
the potential to damage an online reputation. Best practices for 
monitoring and managing online reputations include setting up 
Google 
 , removing detrimental posts and 
photos, creating separate personal and professional sites, and 
maintaining civil discourse. 
 is freedom 
from intrusive surveillance and the expectation that individuals 
can control their personally 
 information. 
Most social media services provide settings that can limit the 
extent to which personal information is disseminated. There are 
six types of social media data: service, 
 , 
entrusted, incidental, behavioral, and derived.

LAB: Analyze Me
SOCIAL ANALYTICS ROCK. They provide statistics about your friends and contacts, connections, links, and the 
content of your posts. They provide an objective, third-party view of your online presence that can assist with your repu-
tation management and help determine if your social media presence projects the right image.
REQUIREMENTS: 
For this lab, you’ll need a Windows or Apple computer with permission to access and install a third-party application. 
You’ll also need a Facebook account. The instructions are generalized; they provide helpful guidelines but not specific 
steps. You may have to explore a bit to find all the tools needed to complete the assignment, but that is all part of the 
learning experience. 
ASSIGNMENT:
 Access Wolfram|Alpha personal analytics for 
Facebook. 
Use a browser to connect to www.wolframalpha.com.
Enter Facebook Report in the search box.
Select the Analyze My Facebook Data button,  then enter 
your Facebook login information.
Click the Okay button to allow the Wolfram|Alpha app to 
access your Facebook data.
Enter a password for your Wolfram|Alpha account, then 
follow the prompts to generate your report.
 Study the analytics for your posting history by scroll-
ing down to the Activity section of the report.
Does your Recent History graph show a record of consis-
tent posts?
Based on the Types chart, do your posts tend to be text-
or photo-based?
Scroll down to the Post Statistics section of the report. 
Based on the number of Likes and comments generated 
by your posts, are you satisfied with the amount of inter-
action?
What is your average post length? Is it longer or shorter 
than you would have expected?
 Evaluate your word cloud.
Scroll down to the section of the report that displays your 
word cloud.
What are the two most prominent words?
Does the text accurately represent the image you want to 
project online?
 Evaluate the demographics of your friends.
What is your ratio of male-to-female friends? 
Describe the distribution of your friends’ ages including 
the oldest and youngest. 
How many of your friends are married and how many are 
single? 
 Study your social connections.
Under the section named “Friends with the most mutual 
friends,” find the friend who has the most mutual friends. 
How many mutual friends do you share?
Scroll down to the color-coded friend network in the 
Friend Network section. Each dot represents a friend 
and is color-coded to correspond to the legend below 
the chart. More widely distributed dots are friends near 
the fringes of your network, while friends with whom you 
interact the most are near the center. If you have fewer 
than 100 friends on the graph, then you can identify who 
is represented by each dot. 
Mouse over the dots that represent your friends on the 
Friend Network graph and notice how the mutual friend 
clusters are color-coded to designate different clusters. 
In the Highlighted Friends section below the chart, look 
at your top social insiders and social outsiders. Do the 
names that appear here make sense to you? Why were 
these friends listed here? What do you suppose is the 
connection between your top social insiders and your top 
social gateways?

Essentials
In the broadest meaning of the term, software refers to all the non-hardware 
components of a digital device. Those components include data files as 
well as files that contain program code. In common use, however, the term 
software is used for computer programs, such as operating systems, appli-
cations, and apps. Let’s begin by looking at the software products that give 
digital devices such a diverse repertoire of functions. 
	What are the main software categories? There are millions of 
software titles. When searching through this overabundance of choices for 
new software, it helps to have a framework of categories, such as the one in 
Figure 6-1.

	Are software categories universal? No. There is no universal 
standard for categorizing software, but various categorization schemes 
have many similarities. For example, Google Play uses a different set 
of categories from Apple’s App Store and Amazon, and yet there are 
similarities. Look for similarities and differences in the software categories

Software	
3 7 3

	What are the most essential applications? Most digital devices 
come loaded with preinstalled applications. Some of these software 
applications are included solely because the software developer has made 
a deal with the device vendor; other applications are more essential. 
Desktop and laptop computers require an operating system with a file 
management system that allows users to view and manipulate data files. A 
basic set of system utilities includes security and antivirus software, network 
management tools, a browser, and device drivers for the mouse, keyboard, 
display device, printer, and other peripheral devices. For application 
software, most desktop and laptop owners require an office suite containing 
productivity software for word processing, spreadsheet manipulation, slide 
show presentations, and scheduling.
Mobile devices tend to be used somewhat differently from desktop and 
laptop computers, so the configuration of their software is slightly different. 
An operating system is still required, but utilities are replaced by settings or 
preferences. Files tend to be stored and retrieved by each app, so users 
have little need for a utility that allows access to the file management 
system. Also, because mobile devices are used primarily to consume 
content, rather than create it, an office suite is not at the top of the must-
have list. Instead, mobile devices tend to be populated by entertainment 
apps, games, and social media services.
Figure 6-3 lists the core sets of software for desktops and laptops as well as 
for mobile devices.

SECTION A, Unit 6
Distribution
Although there are offline sources for software, most consumers obtain 
software online, where it can be downloaded directly from the developer or 
from a software aggregator.
	What are the components of a typical software application? 
A software application may contain a single executable file or it may be 
composed of many separate files that work together. An executable file 
contains a computer program that is carried out step-by-step within the 
microprocessor. Executable files designed for Windows computers usually 
have an .exe file name extension, whereas executable files for Macs with 
OS X have .app extensions.
To prepare software for distribution, the distribution files are usually zipped 
or packaged into a single unit that can be easily downloaded over the 
Internet or transferred from a CD.
	What are the best sources for software? Software can 
contain viruses and other malware, so consumers should download new 
applications only from trusted sources. Although there is never a guarantee 
that an application is malware-free, the major app stores, such as Google 
Play and the Apple App Store, have policies in place that discourage harmful 
programming. Checking user comments and ratings at these sites is always 
a good practice that can help consumers avoid downloading risky apps and 
those that are not well designed.
Software download sites, such as CNET and Tucows, offer applications 
from multiple developers. The focus of these software outlets is applications 
for desktop and laptop computers. A Google search for free software yields 
many sites, but be careful. Some of these sites are riddled with ads and 
spyware that will infect your device even if you do not download anything.
Software developers usually have a Web site for distributing software. Well-
established developers tend to offer trustworthy products. Be careful when 
dealing with smaller vendors. Always confirm that payment transactions are 
processed over a secure HTTPS connection, and consider using PayPal 
rather than a credit card if you doubt the integrity of the site operators. 
	How important are system requirements? System requirements 
specify the operating system and minimum hardware capacities necessary 
for a software product to work correctly. These requirements are listed at the 
download site and are worth reviewing. They will help you to determine if 
the software is compatible with your device and how much storage space it 
requires (Figure 6-4).

	What are updates and upgrades? Periodically, software publishers 
release a new version or edition of a software product that is sometimes 
referred to as a software upgrade. Each release carries a version number, 
such as 1.0 or 2.0. Upgrading to a new version usually involves a fee, but it 
is typically less costly than purchasing the new version off the shelf.
A software update (sometimes called a software patch) is a small section of 
program code that replaces part of the software currently installed. The term 
service pack, which usually applies to operating system updates, refers 
to a set of updates. Updates and service packs are designed to correct 
problems and address security vulnerabilities. They are distinguished by 
revision numbers such as 2.101. Software updates and service packs are 
usually free. 
	What payment options are available? Software can be obtained 
under a variety of pricing models. The availability of one or more of these 
pricing plans depends on the software vendor.
One-time purchase. The traditional way to obtain software is through 
a one-time purchase in which the consumer pays a set amount to license 
and use the software without an expiration date. The advantage of the one-
time purchase pricing model is that there are no additional fees, and with 
the exception of a few updates, the software remains basically the same 
as when it was purchased. There are no surprise changes to the way the 
software looks or works during its lifetime.
Subscription. The subscription pricing model is an emerging trend 
in which consumers pay a monthly or an annual fee to use the software. 
Consumers benefit because updates and upgrades are usually included in 
the pricing. Consumers must remain alert while using subscription services. 
When a subscription lapses, the software may cease to function. Some 
vendors allow former customers to launch the software and view files but do 
not allow those files to be further modified. Credit card information is stored 
on the vendor’s site and may be vulnerable to hacking. 
Trial. A third type of pricing model offers consumers the use of a software 
product during a free trial period. The trial version may be fully functional or 
it may be limited in functionality. When the trial period ends, payment in the 
form of a one-time purchase or subscription is required. This pricing model 
is common for software applications, such as antivirus utilities, games, and 
weather apps, that are preinstalled on new devices. 
Freemium. Another popular pricing model for software provides free use 
of a stripped-down or basic version of the product but requires payment for 
upgraded features (Figure 6-5).

SECTION A, Unit 6
Software Licenses
Purchasing software is not the same as buying tangible goods, such as 
mittens, chairs, and shoes, that can be bought outright by consumers. Once 
they’ve been purchased, tangible goods can be used, altered, loaned to 
friends, resold, or given away. In contrast, a software purchase is actually 
a license agreement that may include certain restrictions. Some licenses 
are less restrictive than others, so their terms are factors to consider when 
selecting software.
	Why is software licensed? A software license, or license agree-
ment, is a legal contract that defines the ways in which a computer program 
may be used. These licenses are sometimes referred to as EULAs (End 
User License Agreements). The reason software is licensed has to do with 
copyrights. 
Like books and movies, software is a type of intellectual property. Software 
copyrights protect the rights of the person or corporation that developed 
the intellectual property. Most software displays a copyright notice, such 
as © 2016 eCourse Corporation, on one of its screens. This notice is not 
required by law, however, so programs without a copyright notice are still 
protected by copyright law. 
A copyright grants the author of a software product an exclusive right to 
copy, distribute, sell, and modify that work. Purchasers do not have this 
right except under the ­circumstances listed in Figure 6-6. 
The purchaser has the right to copy software from 
distribution media or a Web site to a device’s internal 
storage medium in order to install it.
The purchaser can make an extra, or backup, copy 
of the software in case the original copy becomes 
erased or damaged—unless the process of making 
the backup requires the purchaser to defeat a copy 
protection mechanism designed to prohibit copying.
The purchaser is allowed to copy and distribute sec-
tions of a software program for use in critical reviews 
and teaching.
Without copyright protection, software would be copied and distributed by 
unauthorized parties without compensation to its authors. Although that 
situation might sound like it benefits consumers, it discourages innovation 
and reduces the incentives for technical support and upgrades in the long 
run.
Copyright protects a software product by imposing a set of restrictions on 
its use. The copyright holder may want to add or remove some of those 
restrictions, and a software license provides the means to do so.

	Where can I find the license for a software product? Most 
legal contracts require signatures before the terms of the contract can 
take effect. This requirement becomes hard to manage with software—
imagine having to sign a license agreement and return it before you can 
use a new app. To circumvent the signature requirement, ­software pub-
lishers use screen-based license agreements.
License agreements are displayed during the installation process. By 
clicking the I Agree button, you consent to the terms of the license 
agreement (Figure 6-7).
	What are the most common types of software licenses? From 
a legal perspective, there are two categories of software: public domain and 
proprietary. Public domain software is not protected by copyright because 
the copyright has expired or the author has placed the program in the pub-
lic domain, making it available without restriction. Public domain software 
may be freely copied, distributed, and even resold. The primary restriction 
on public domain software is that you are not allowed to apply for a copyright 
on it. 
Proprietary software has restrictions on its use that are delineated by 
copyright, patents, or license agreements. Some proprietary software is dis-
tributed commercially, whereas some of it is free. Based on licensing rights, 
proprietary software is distributed as commercial software, freeware, demo-
ware, or open source software.
	What is commercial software? Commercial software is usually 
sold in retail stores or on Web sites. Most licenses for commercial soft-
ware adhere closely to the limitations provided by copyright law, although 
they might permit the software to be installed on multiple devices. A further 
restriction could permit the software to be used on only one device at a time.
Most commercial software is distributed under a single-user license that 
limits use to one person at a time. However, some software publishers 
offer volume licenses, such as site licenses and multiple-user licenses, to 
schools, organizations, and businesses. 
A site license is generally priced at a flat rate and allows software to be used 
on all computers at a specific location. A multiple-user license is priced per 
copy and allows the allocated number of copies to be used simultaneously.

SECTION A, Unit 6
	What about freeware? Freeware is copyrighted software that—as 
you might expect—is available for free. It is fully functional and requires no 
payment for its use. A freeware license permits you to use the software, 
copy it, and give it away, but the license does not permit you to alter or sell 
the software. Many utility programs, most device drivers, and some games 
are available as freeware. 
	What is demoware? Some proprietary software is available as a 
trial version, sometimes called demoware. Demoware is distributed for free 
and often comes preinstalled on new devices, but it is limited in some way 
until you pay for it. 
Demoware publishers can use a variety of techniques to limit use of the 
software. It might remain functional for a set number of days before expir-
ing and requiring payment. It might run for a limited amount of time—for 
example, 60 minutes—each time you launch it. Demoware could be config-
ured so that you can run it only a limited number of times. Or key features, 
such as printing, might be disabled. 
Demoware publishers usually take steps to prevent users from uninstalling 
and reinstalling the demo to circumvent time limitations. Users who want to 
unlock the full version of a demo can do so by following links to the software 
publisher’s Web site and using a credit card to purchase an activation code. 
The software can then be restarted and used without further interruption 
after the activation code is entered. 
	How do activation codes work? Product activation is a means of 
protecting software from illegal copying by requiring users to enter a prod-
uct key or an activation code before the software can be used. Activation is 
usually part of the software installation process, but it can also occur when 
demoware times out. Failure to enter a valid code prohibits the program 
from launching. The information you enter is either checked against an 
online database or used to create a hash value.
Checking an activation code against an online database ensures that the 
code you’ve entered has not been used before. If the code is a duplicate, 
then the license for that copy of the software is being used by someone else 
and you will have to call customer service to straighten out the problem.
A hash value is a unique number derived from encoding one or more data 
sets, such as names, serial numbers, and validation codes. Product vali-
dation can create a hash value based on your validation code and your 
device’s internal serial number, effectively tying the software and its use to 
one specific device.
	Is shareware the same as demoware? Shareware is copy-
righted software marketed under a try-before-you-buy policy. Shareware 
was conceived as a low-cost marketing and distribution channel for inde-
pendent programmers. A shareware license usually encourages people 
to make copies of the software and distribute them to others. Copying—
considered a bad thing by commercial software publishers—can work to 
the advantage of shareware authors, but only if users pay for the prod-
uct. Unfortunately, many shareware authors collect only a fraction of the 
money they deserve for their programming efforts. The distinction between 
shareware and demoware is that shareware typically does not have built-in 
limitations that are removed when a consumer switches to a paid version.

	What is open source software? Open source software 
makes uncompiled program instructions—the source code—available to 
­programmers who want to modify and improve the software. Open source 
software may be sold or distributed free of charge in a compiled form, but it 
must, in every case, also include the source code. 
Linux is an example of open source software, as are programs such as 
Blender and FileZilla. LibreOffice—a full-featured productivity suite—is 
another popular example of open source software. You can search for open 
source applications at the SourceForge Web site.
Despite the lack of restrictions on distribution and use, open source soft-
ware is copyrighted and is not in the public domain. It is not the same as 
freeware, which you are not supposed to modify or resell. Two of the most 
common open source and free software licenses are BSD and GPL. The 
BSD license originated as the Berkeley Software Distribution license for a 
server operating system. The license is simple and short (Figure 6-8).

THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
	What is unique about GPL licenses? The GPL (General Public 
License) was developed for a free operating system called GNU. The GPL 
is slightly more restrictive than the BSD license because it requires deriva-
tive works to be licensed. That means if you get a really cool computer 
game that’s licensed under a GPL and you modify the game to create a 
new level, you have to distribute your modification under the GPL. You can-
not legally market your modification under a commercial software license. 
There are currently three versions of the GPL. Their differences are of inter-
est primarily to software developers.

PIRATED SOFTWARE
People who circumvent copyright law and illegally copy, distribute, or modify 
software are sometimes called software pirates, and their illegal copies are 
referred to as pirated software.
	How can I tell if software is pirated? Software pirates are get-
ting more and more aggressive, and pirated software is not always easy to 
identify. Some unsuspecting consumers have inadvertently obtained pirated 
software, even when paying full price from a reputable source. Widespread 
pirating of Microsoft products has led to preventive measures such as 
Certificates of Authenticity and expensive-to-duplicate holographic images 
on CD labels. 
If you suspect that software is pirated, it is best not to buy it or install it. 
If you have questions about a product’s authenticity, you can contact the 
Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA) or the legitimate soft-
ware publisher. According to the SIIA, the following characteristics can help 
you spot pirated software:
1.	
Executable files for a PC have an .exe extension, 
whereas executable files for Macs have a(n) 
 extension.
2.	
The term service pack refers to a collection of 
 designed to correct prob-
lems and address security vulnerabilities.
3.	
The 
 pricing model provides 
free use of a basic version of the product, but 
upgraded features require payment.

number that can be used to validate an activa-
tion code.

AN OPERATING SYSTEM is an integral 
part of virtually every digital device. It fundamen-
tally affects how you can use a desktop, laptop, 
tablet, or smartphone. Can you run two programs 
at the same time? Can you connect the device to a 
network? Does the device run dependably? Does it 
accept touch input? To answer questions like these, 
it is helpful to have a clear idea about what an 
operating system is and what it does.

Operating System basics
An operating system gives your digital device a personality. It controls key 
elements of the user interface, which includes the visual experience as 
well as the keyboard, mouse, microphone, or touchscreen that collects user 
commands. Behind the scenes, the operating system is busy supervising 
critical operations that take place within a device.
	Are there many different categories of operating systems? 
Consumers are familiar with operating systems such as Windows and iOS, 
but there are several others in widespread use. Operating systems can be 
categorized by the devices on which they are used (Figure 6-10).
QuickCheck
The operating system kernel 
provides essential services and 
remains __________ while the 
computer is on.
a.	 inactive
b.	 in RAM
c.	 off
d.	 mobile
Desktop operating systems. 
A desktop operating system is 
designed for a desktop or laptop 
computer. The computer you use 
at home, at school, or at work 
is most likely configured with a 
desktop operating system, such 
as Microsoft Windows, OS X, or 
Chrome OS. Key characteristics 
of desktop operating systems 
include the following:
• Accommodate one user at a 
time, but allow multiple accounts
• Provide local area networking 
capability
• Include file management tools
• Run more than one application 
at a time
• Offer a graphical user interface 
designed for keyboard and 
mouse input
Mobile operating systems. 
Operating systems such as iOS 
and Android are classified as 
mobile operating systems 
because they are designed for 
use on smartphones, tablet com-
puters, and ebook readers. Key 
characteristics of mobile operating 
systems include the following:
• Accommodate one user at a 
time
• Provide connectivity to wireless 
local area networks
• Offer a graphical user interface 
designed for touchscreen input
• Include integrated cellular com-
munications
Server operating systems. 
Computers that are deployed as 
Web servers, or as servers for 
files, applications, databases, 
or email, generally use a server 
operating system designed for 
distributed networks accessed by 
many simultaneous users. Linux, 
UNIX, Windows Server, and OS 
X Server are examples of popular 
server operating systems with the 
following characteristics:
• Accommodate multiple simulta-
neous users
• Include sophisticated network 
management and security tools
• Provide a utilitarian user inter-
face
	Where is the operating system? In some digital devices, such 
as smartphones and ebook readers, the entire operating system is small 
enough to be stored in ROM. For most other computers, the operating sys-
tem program is quite large, so most of it is stored on a hard disk or SSD. 
During the boot process, the operating system kernel is loaded into RAM. 
A kernel provides essential operating system services, such as memory 
management and file access. The kernel stays in RAM the entire time your 
computer is on. Other parts of the operating system, such as customization 
utilities, are loaded into RAM as they are needed.

SECTION B, Unit 6
	What does an operating system do? An operating system inter-
acts with application software, device drivers, and hardware to manage a 
set of resources. In the context of digital devices, the term resource refers 
to any component that is required to perform work. 
The processor is a device’s main resource. RAM, storage space, and 
peripheral devices are also resources. While you interact with applica-
tion software, the operating system is busy behind the scenes performing 
resource management tasks such as those listed in Figure 6-11.
Manage processor resources to handle simultaneous input, 
output, and processing tasks
Manage memory by allocating space for all the programs and 
data that are in use during a computing session
Keep track of storage resources so that files and programs can 
be found and manipulated
Ensure that input and output proceed in an orderly manner by 
communicating with peripheral devices
Establish basic elements of the user interface such as the 
appearance of the desktop, menus, and toolbars
Figure 6-11: Operating System resource Management tasks
	How do operating systems manage processor resources? 
Every microprocessor cycle is a resource for accomplishing a task, such 
as executing a program instruction. Many activities—called processes—
compete for the attention of a device’s microprocessor. The microprocessor 
receives commands as software carries out tasks and while input arrives 
from the keyboard, mouse, and other devices. At the same time, data is 
being sent to output devices or over network connections. 
To manage all these competing processes, an operating system must 
ensure that each process receives its share of attention from the micro-
processor. You can check the processes that are being executed by using 
system utilities such as Task Manager (Figure 6-12).

	How do operating systems handle so many processes? During 
a typical session, a laptop computer might run an average of 50 processes. 
Ideally, the operating system should be able to help the microprocessor 
switch seamlessly from one process to another. Depending on the capa-
bilities of the operating system and computer hardware, processes can be 
managed by multitasking, multithreading, and multiprocessing. 
Multitasking. Most of today’s popular operating systems offer multitasking 
services. Multitasking provides process and memory management ser-
vices that allow two or more tasks, jobs, or programs to run simultaneously. 
Multithreading. Within a single program, multithreading allows multiple 
commands, or threads, to run simultaneously. For example, one thread for 
a spreadsheet program might be waiting for input from the user while other 
threads perform a long calculation in the background. Multithreading can 
speed up performance on single- or multiple-processor devices.
Multiprocessing. Many digital devices include multi-core processors or 
multiple processors. An operating system’s multiprocessing capability 
supports a division of labor among all the processing units.
	How does an operating system manage memory? A micropro-
cessor works with data and executes instructions stored in RAM—one of 
the most important resources for a digital device. When you want to run 
more than one application at a time, the operating system has to allocate 
specific areas of memory for each. 
Sometimes an application requests memory but never releases it—a con-
dition called a memory leak. Memory “leaks” away into this application’s 
reserved area, eventually preventing other applications from accessing 
enough memory to function properly (Figure 6-13). Those applications 
can crash, and the operating system might display error messages, such 
as “General Protection Fault” or “Program Not Responding.” A device can 
sometimes recover from a memory leak if you access Task Manager (PC) 
or Activity Monitor (Mac) to close the corrupted application.

SECTION B, Unit 6
	How does the OS keep track of storage resources? Behind the 
scenes, an operating system acts as a filing clerk that stores and retrieves 
files from various storage devices. It remembers the names and locations 
of all your files and keeps track of empty spaces where new files can be 
stored. Later in this unit, you’ll explore file storage in more depth and learn 
how the operating system affects the way you create, name, save, and 
retrieve files.
	Why does the operating system get involved with 
peripheral devices? Every peripheral device connected to a computer 
is regarded as an input or output resource. Your computer’s operating 
system communicates with device driver software so that data can travel 
smoothly between the computer and peripheral resources. If a peripheral 
device or driver is not performing correctly, the operating system makes a 
decision about what to do—usually it displays an on-screen message to 
warn you of the problem. 
An operating system ensures that input and output proceed in an orderly 
manner, using buffers to collect and hold data while the device is busy with 
other tasks. By using a keyboard buffer, for example, your computer never 
misses one of your keystrokes, regardless of how fast you type or what else 
is ­happening in your computer at the same time (Figure 6-14).

Microsoft windows
Microsoft Windows is installed on more than 80% of the world’s personal 
computers. Its screen-based desktop is populated with colorful icons used 
to launch applications, connect to Web sites, and organize files. 
	Why “Windows”? The Windows operating system got its name from 
the rectangular work areas displayed on its screen-based desktop. Each 
window can display a different document or application, which provides a 
visual model of the operating system’s multitasking capabilities. Figure 6-15

SECTION B, Unit 6
	What do I need to know about the evolution of Windows? 
Windows evolved from a Microsoft operating system called DOS (Disk 
Operating System) that was designed to run on early PCs with Intel or Intel-
compatible microprocessors. 
To create Microsoft Windows, developers used the DOS kernel but added 
a point-and-click graphical user interface. DOS was eventually dropped in 
favor of the NT kernel. Since its introduction in 1985, Windows has evolved 
through several versions. Some of these versions are still in use today, so 
it is helpful to be able to recognize and use them. The most recent versions 
are Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10 (Figure 6-16).
Windows 7 was released 
in 2009. It features a 
round Start button that 
produces a Search box 
and a Start menu for 
launching applications 
and utilities. Desktop 
icons provide an alter-
native way to access 
applications.
Windows 8 was released 
in 2012. It has no Start but-
ton. Instead, colorful tiles 
provide access to programs 
and utilities. A Search box 
appears when any key is 
pressed.
Windows 10 was released in 2015 after Microsoft decided 
to skip Windows 9. The Start button is again a prominent 
element of the taskbar. The Start menu includes a Search 
box, a list of frequently used applications, and a set of tiles 
for accessing applications.

	Does Windows run on tablets and phones, too? Microsoft offers 
several editions of Windows designed for desktop and laptop computers. 
In addition to basic Windows, consumers can purchase Windows Pro and 
Windows Enterprise editions, which are designed for power users and busi-
nesses. 
Microsoft also offers mobile operating systems for tablets and smartphones 
(Figure 6-17). For example, Microsoft designed an operating system called 
Windows RT as a mobile operating system for tablet devices with ARM pro-
cessors. It does not include a full-featured desktop and will not run Windows 
desktop applications. Like other mobile operating systems, Windows RT 
limits software to apps obtained through an authorized online store. 
	What are the strengths of Windows? The number and variety of 
programs that run on Windows are unmatched by any other operating sys-
tem. For the best selection of software, especially for games and business 
software, Windows is the operating system of choice.
The Windows user community is also a strength. Comprehensive tutori-
als and troubleshooting guides can be found online and on the shelves 
of most bookstores. Microsoft’s official site, www.microsoft.com, includes 
thousands of pages of easily searchable information.
Windows computer owners can select from a vast array of peripheral 
devices. Many of the fastest graphics cards and the coolest joysticks are 
offered exclusively for the Windows platform. 
	What are Windows’ weaknesses? Windows has been criticized for 
two major weaknesses: reliability and security. The reliability of an oper-
ating system is usually gauged by the length of time it operates without 
glitches. Windows tends to become unstable with more frequency than 
other operating systems. 
Slow system response, programs that stop working, and error messages 
can be symptoms of a Windows malfunction. Rebooting usually clears the 
error condition and returns a computer to normal functionality, but the time 
wasted shutting down and waiting for a reboot adds unnecessary frustration 
to the computing experience.
Of the major desktop operating systems, Windows has the reputation 
for being the most vulnerable to viruses, worms, and other attacks. One 
reason for Windows’ vulnerability is its huge user base makes it the big-
gest target for hackers. Although Microsoft is diligent in its efforts to patch 
security holes, its programmers are often one step behind the hackers; 
while users wait for patches, their computers are vulnerable.

OS X
In 1984, Apple Inc. introduced a computer “for the rest of us.” Designed for 
non-business, non IBM-PC users, the first Macintosh computers featured 
a desktop dotted with graphical icons that could be launched by clicking a 
mouse. That desktop evolved into the OS X that powers today’s Macs.  
	What’s unique about OS X? As a desktop operating system, OS X 
features beautifully designed icons and multiple rectangular work areas to 
reflect multitasking capabilities. Characteristic features of the Mac desktop 
are shown in Figure 6-18. 
	What do I need to know about the evolution of OS X? Like 
Windows, OS X has been through a number of revisions. The original 
Classic Mac OS was introduced in 1984 and designed for a line of Macintosh 
computers based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. 
In 2001, Classic Mac OS was rewritten to run on Macintosh computers 
containing PowerPC microprocessors produced by IBM. The new Mac 
OS was designated Mac OS X. It was commonly called Cheetah, starting 
a tradition for easy-to-remember nicknames that continues today. 
In 2006, Macintosh hardware changed significantly with the switch from 
PowerPC to Intel processors. Mac OS X was rewritten again. The first ver-
sion of Mac OS X to support the Intel architecture was Mac OS X version 
10.4.4, sometimes referred to as Tiger. In 2012, Apple released OS X 10.8 
and officially dropped “Mac” from the operating system’s name. A time line 
of OS X development is detailed in Figure 6-19.

	What are the strengths of OS X? OS X has a reputation for being 
an easy-to-use, reliable, and secure operating system. According to indus-
try observers, Macintosh developers have always been in the lead when it 
comes to intuitive user interface design. 
The operating system kernel of OS X is based on UNIX, a server operat-
ing system that includes industrial-strength memory protection features that 
contribute to a low incidence of errors and glitches. OS X inherited a strong 
security foundation from UNIX that tends to limit the number of security 
holes and the damage that can be done by hackers who manage to slip in. 
Another factor that contributes to the security of computers running OS X 
is that fewer viruses are designed to target Macs because the user base is 
smaller than the Windows user base. 
Regardless of the relative security of computers running OS X, Macintosh 
owners should practice safe computing by applying software updates and 
OS patches as they become available, activating wireless network encryp-
tion, not opening suspicious email attachments, and not clicking links 
embedded in email messages. 
	What are the weaknesses of OS X? The weaknesses of OS X 
include a somewhat limited selection of software and its use of resource 
forks. A decent collection of software is available for computers that run 
OS X, although the selection is not as vast as the Windows collection. Many 
of the most prolific software publishers produce one version of their software 
for Windows and another, similar version for OS X. 
Macintosh computer owners might find that some popular software titles 
are not available for OS X. The selection of games, for example, is much 
sparser than for Windows, although it should be noted that the selection of 
graphics software for OS X is as good as or better than the selection avail-
able for Windows. 
	What is a resource fork? In most operating systems, a file is a single 
unit that contains data or program code. Files maintained by OS X, how-
ever, can have two parts, called forks. The data fork is similar to files in 
other operating systems. It contains data, such as the text for a document, 
the graphics for a photo, or the commands for a program. The resource 
fork is a companion file that stores information about the data in the data 
fork, such as the file type and the application that created it. 
Although resource forks have advantages on their native Macintosh plat-
form, they can be a nuisance when files are transferred to other platforms. 
When you copy a file from a Mac to a Windows computer, for example, you 
might end up with two files: one for the data fork and one for the resource 
fork. The resource fork begins with a period and can usually be ignored or 
deleted from the Windows directory (Figure 6-20).
Figure 6-20: Resource forks 
These resource forks appear when 
a program from a Mac is copied to 
a computer running Windows. The 
.DS files are not used by Windows 
and can be deleted.

iOS
OS X is for desktop and laptop computers, but its cousin, iOS, powers 
mobile devices, such as iPhones, iPads, and iPods.
How is iOS related to OS X? iOS is derived from the OS X code and 
shares its UNIX roots. Both operating systems feature icons with a simi-
lar design aesthetic.
How does iOS work? iOS displays a home screen containing applica-
tion icons. At the bottom of the screen, a dock holds icons for frequently 
used apps. Touching an app launches it. Pressing the physical Home button 
located on the device returns the user to the home screen. The Settings icon 
leads to a variety of system utilities (Figure 6-21).
Apps can be grouped into folders to save space on the Home screen. 
Touching and holding an app icon produces “Jiggle mode” in which icons 
vibrate to indicate they are in a modifiable state. From Jiggle mode, icons 
can be deleted or dragged on top of each other to put them into a folder.
iOS was the first operating system to offer routines to manage touchscreen 
gesture inputs, such as using your fingers to “squeeze” an on-screen graphic 
into a smaller size.
As a mobile operating system, iOS provides connectivity options, such as 
3G and 4G cell phone connections, as well as local networking. Although 
all iOS devices have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capability, only iPhones and some 
iPads have cellular capabilities.
What are the limitations of iOS? iOS limits your selection of apps 
to those provided by the online Apple App Store, unless you make unau-
thorized modifications to “jailbreak” the phone. Jailbreaking also overcomes 
other limitations, such as lack of access to the file system. Unlike full desk-
top operating systems, iOS does not include a file manager. The only way to 
access a data file is through the app that was used to create it.
You won’t find a desktop with application windows on an iOS device. Each 
app fills the entire screen. Background processes, such as music, voice 
calls, and notifications, provide very limited multitasking capabilities.

ANDROID
Words such as cupcake, donut, jellybean, and lollipop might bring to mind 
sugary sweets, but they are also the nicknames for versions of the Android 
operating system.
What is Android? Android is a mobile operating system that is a popu-
lar platform for tablet computers, smartphones, and ebook readers. Android 
was developed by a consortium of technology companies and unveiled 
in 2007. It is an open source operating system under the project leader-
ship of Google. As with other popular mobile operating systems, Android is 
designed for ARM processors.
How does Android work? Android displays a home screen containing 
icons that represent software applications. Touching an icon launches the 
app. 
Unlike iOS and Windows RT devices, Android devices have a screen-based 
home button rather than a physical button. Touching the on-screen home 
button recalls the home screen (Figure 6-22).
2015 Google
What’s unique about Android? In addition to touchscreen input, the 
Android OS supports voice input for Google searching, voice dialing, navi-
gation, and other applications.
The Android OS contains basic network and routing routines that allow 
Android devices to become Wi-Fi hotspots. For example, activating the 
Network utility on an Android-based smartphone transforms the phone into 
a router, and the phone’s data connection can be used by a nearby desk-
top, laptop, or tablet computer to access the Internet. 
Android provides access to the file system and provides a utility for viewing 
files stored internally or on external SD cards. A third-party file manager util-
ity is required to manipulate files.

CHROME OS
For consumers whose digital footprints rarely leave the cloud, there is an 
operating system that provides a simple and secure platform. Sometimes 
described as a browser-based operating system, Chrome OS has limita-
tions, but those limitations are not necessarily negative.
What is Chrome OS? Google launched an operating system called 
Chrome OS in 2009. Its kernel is based on an open source operating sys-
tem called Linux, but Chrome OS itself is distributed under a proprietary 
license. This situation is common in the open source community where a 
product with an open-source license is forked—meaning that the source 
code is developed and updated on two different paths by separate organi-
zations. In the case of Chrome OS, the source code from a project called 
Chromium was appropriated by Google, modified with proprietary code, and 
then distributed under the Chrome OS license that does not allow copying, 
modifications, or redistribution.
What are the pros and cons of Chrome OS? Chrome OS is an 
example of a thin client because it depends substantially on processing and 
storage provided by a remote computer—in this case, cloud-based servers. 
To get a sense of the Chrome OS world, visualize a browser as your desktop 
and imagine that your digital world is limited to only those online applica-
tions, communications, and storage locations that the browser can access.
As cloud services become more extensive, Chrome OS becomes less and 
less limiting. Unlike iPads, Chromebooks support multiple users. They pro-
vide very limited local storage space, however, and do not offer connections 
to wired printers or scanners. Google claims that Chrome OS is very secure, 
but consumers understand that the security is equivalent to that provided by 
a browser and by cloud storage services.
Who uses Chrome OS? Currently, Chrome OS powers inexpensive 
clamshell-style devices called Chromebooks that are popular in educational 
settings and for light business use. Chromebooks boot very quickly to a sim-
ple desktop where apps are displayed in the Chrome browser (Figure 6-23).

VIRTUAL MACHINES
We tend to think of an operating system as an immutable part of our digi-
tal devices. PCs always run Windows, Macs always run OS X, Samsung 
phones run Android. Is it possible to run Windows on a Mac and emulate 
an Android device on a desktop computer? Yes, it is possible using virtual 
machines.
	What is a virtual machine? A virtual machine (VM) allows one 
computer to simulate the hardware and software of another. Each virtual 
machine has its own simulated processor, RAM, video card, input and out-
put ports, and operating system. Each machine can run most software that’s 
compatible with the virtual OS platform.
Popular virtual machine software such as VMware and Parallels Desktop 
can run on most computers with Intel microprocessors, including Intel Macs, 
PCs, and generic Linux computers. The computer boots into its native OS 
such as OS X, but users can then launch a virtual machine running guest 
operating systems, such as Windows. The virtual machine’s desktop 
appears in a window on the host desktop (Figure 6-24).

It is surprising how quickly you out-
grow the standard set of apps that are preinstalled 
on your digital devices. When shopping for new 
apps and applications, you’ll have your choice of 
software paradigms, which determine whether the 
software gets installed and takes up space on an 
internal storage device. Knowing the ins and outs 
of each paradigm will help you make the right soft-
ware choices.

Web Apps
Chromebook owners depend on Web apps for the software they use for just 
about every task in the digital world. Web apps also have advantages for 
owners of other devices, from desktops to smartwatches. Find out why you 
might want to seek out Web apps for your own software collection.
	What are Web apps? A Web application (or Web app) is software 
that is accessed with a Web browser. Instead of running program files that 
are stored locally, the code for Web applications is downloaded along with 
HTML pages and is executed client-side by the browser. Program code for 
some Web applications may also run on a remote server. 
Web apps are examples of cloud computing. You might be familiar with 
some frequently used Web apps, such as Gmail, Google Docs, and Turnitin, 
but there are thousands more.
Many Web apps are associated with consumer sites, such as the Color 
Visualizer at the Sherwin-Williams Web site that uses a photo of your house 
to help you select paint colors. Other Web apps, such as the XE Currency 
Converter, have dedicated sites.
	Do I have to install Web apps? Most Web apps require no instal-
lation at all on your local computer or handheld device. Your device must, 
however, have a Web browser and an Internet connection.
To access a Web app, simply go to its Web site. You might have to register 
before your first use, and then log in using your registered user name and 
password for subsequent visits. Your browser will remain open while the 
app is in use (Figure 6-25).

SECTION C, Unit 6
+  You can access Web apps from any device that has a 
browser and an Internet connection, including full-
size computers, smartphones, tablet computers, and 
enhanced media players.
+  Your data is usually stored on the app’s Web site, so you 
can access data even when you are away from your main 
computer.
+  Web apps are always up to date; you don’t have to install 
updates because the latest version is the one posted at 
the Web site where you access the app.
+  Web apps don’t require local storage space, so you don’t 
have to worry about them accumulating on your hard disk 
or SSD.
-  Web apps tend to have fewer features than applications 
that require installation.
-  If the site hosting the app shuts down, you will not be able 
to access the application or your data.
-  Your data might be more vulnerable to exposure or loss 
because it is out of your control. If possible, back up data 
to a local device or to an auxiliary cloud storage site.

	Who uses Web apps? Just about everyone. Web apps are particu-
larly suited for consumer-level activities, such as basic word processing, 
spreadsheet creation, photo editing, audio recording, video editing, presen-
tation design, and personal finance management. Although they may not 
yet provide features required by professionals, the sophistication of Web 
apps continues to increase.
As an extra bonus, many Web apps allow several people to collaborate on 
projects because the project files are stored on the Web and can be easily 
shared (Figure 6-26).
	What are the advantages and disadvantages of Web apps? 
Web apps are truly handy, but consider their advantages and disadvan-
tages before entrusting them with your work:

mobile Apps
Although just about every mobile device includes a browser, the current 
trend is not to use Web apps on mobile devices. Following Apple’s lead, 
most mobile developers offer apps that are installed locally on a smart-
phone or tablet. 
	What are mobile apps? A mobile app is designed for a handheld 
device, such as a smartphone, tablet computer, or enhanced media player. 
They are generally small, focused applications sold through an online app 
store. 
	How do mobile apps differ from Web apps? Most handheld 
devices can use both Web apps and mobile apps. The difference between 
the two is that the program code for Web apps arrives only when you use 
the app, whereas mobile apps are stored on the handheld device, so they 
have to be downloaded and installed. 
Some mobile apps, such as Yelp and Pandora, are hybrids. A thin client is 
downloaded from an app store, but during use, data is accessed from the 
Web. These hybrid apps can only function correctly when the device is con-
nected to the Internet, and their use can rack up megabytes on your mobile 
plan. Figure 6-27 summarizes software options for mobile devices. 
	How do I install mobile apps? The first step is to head to your 
device’s app store. iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch owners can find apps for 
their devices at the online iTunes App Store; Droid and Galaxy owners can 
go to the Android Market. Most handheld devices have an icon that takes 
you directly to the app store for your device’s platform.
At the app store, select an app and pay for it, if necessary. Touching the 
Download button retrieves the file and installs it automatically. The installa-
tion process places the app’s program file on the storage device and creates 
an icon that you can use to launch the app.
	What is jailbreaking? iPads, iPhones, and iPods are only allowed 
to download apps from the official iTunes App Store. Apps are available 
from other sources, but using them requires an unauthorized change to the 
device’s software called a jailbreak. After downloading and installing the 
jailbreak software, your device will be able to install apps from a variety of 
sources other than the iTunes App Store. The jailbreak lasts until you accept 
a software update from Apple. Updates wipe out the jailbreak software, forc-
ing you to reinstall it.
	Can I jailbreak an Android device? Android phones are not limited 
to a single app store, so there is no need to jailbreak them to access more 
apps. There are various ways to make unauthorized modifications to any 
mobile device to overcome limitations imposed by mobile service providers. 
The process is called rooting, but most consumers have no need to root 
their mobile devices.

SECTION C, Unit 6
Local Applications
A local application is installed on a computer’s hard disk. When it runs, 
the program code is copied into RAM, where it can be accessed by the 
microprocessor. Office suites, games, and professional software tools are 
common examples of local applications for desktop and laptop computers. 
Local applications do not require an Internet connection to run.
	What’s included in a typical software package? Software for 
Macs is usually stored in a single executable file with an .app extension. That 
file, however, is actually a package that contains other files and folders. The 
contents of an application’s package can be viewed by right-clicking the .app 
file and selecting Show Package Contents.
Software designed for computers that run Microsoft Windows is commonly 
composed of multiple files. The main executable file has an .exe extension—
for example, Inkscape.exe. Additional files required for Windows application 
software contain support modules called application extensions with file 
names that end in .dll, as shown in Figure 6-28.
Figure 6-28: PC Software Can be composed of many files
User-executable ­program 
files contain program code 
and usually end in .exe.
Application extensions are 
support files with file names 
that usually end in .dll.

	What is the process for installing software on PCs? Software 
for PCs contains a setup program that guides you through the installation 
process. The setup program makes installation easy because it handles a 
variety of behind-the-scenes technical details. During the installation pro-
cess, the setup program usually performs the following activities:
• Copy files. Copies application files from distribution media (CDs or DVDs) 
or downloads files to specified folders on the hard disk
• Unzip files. Reconstitutes files that have been distributed in compressed 
format
• Check resources. Analyzes the computer’s resources, such as proces-
sor speed, RAM capacity, and hard disk capacity, to verify that they meet or 
exceed the minimum system requirements
• Select device drivers. Analyzes hardware components and peripheral 
devices to select appropriate device drivers
• Find players. Looks for any system files and players, such as Internet 
Explorer or Windows Media Player, that are required to run the program but 
are not supplied on the distribution media or download
• Update the Registry. Updates necessary system files, such as the 
Windows Registry and the Start menu, with information about the new soft-
ware
• Update the desktop. Places an icon or tile for the new software on the 
Windows desktop, Start screen, or Start menu (Figure 6-29)
Figure 6-29: Launch Icons from the Desktop or Start Screen
Double-clicking a 
desktop icon launches 
the application.
Selecting a tile from the Start 
screen or Start menu also 
launches an application.
Terminology
The Windows Registry is a 
database that keeps track of a 
computer’s peripheral devices, 
software, preferences, and 
settings. When you install 
software on a computer 
running the Windows 
operating system, information 
about the software is recorded 
in the Registry.

	How do I download and install software on a PC? The EXE and 
DLL files for Windows application software are zipped to consolidate them 
into one large file, which is compressed to decrease its size and reduce the 
download time. As part of the installation process, this downloaded file must 
be reconstituted, or unzipped, into the original collection of files.
Downloaded files are generally stored in the Downloads folder. You can 
back up this folder periodically. If your computer’s hard drive malfunctions, 
you can use these files to rebuild your software collection without having to 
download all of it again. Figure 6-30 maps out the process of downloading 
and installing local apps on a PC.
Figure 6-30: Download and Install Software on a PC
1. At the distribution Web site, 
read the installation instructions, 
then select the Download link.
2. If you are downloading from a 
trusted site and have antivirus soft-
ware running, select the Run button.
3. Wait for the download to finish. 
The setup program included in the 
download starts automatically.
5. Select a folder to hold the new 
application. You can use the default 
folder specified by the setup 
program or a folder of your own 
choosing. You can also create a new 
folder during the setup process.
4. Read the license agreement and 
accept its terms to continue with the 
installation.
6. Wait for the setup program to 
uncompress the downloaded file and 
install the software in the selected 
directory. When the installation is 
complete, launch the software to 
make sure it works.
QuickCheck
When downloading software, 
why should you select Run only 
at trusted sites?
a. 	Because it doesn’t have to 
check for viruses
b.	 Because the setup program is 
going to automatically run; if 
it contains a virus, it could be 
transmitted
c.	 Because if you select Save, 
you might forget where the 
program is stored
d.	 Because the download is 
then transmitted over an 
HTTPS connection

	How do I install software on a Mac? Mac software is easy to install. 
Downloads are ordinarily supplied as a DMG package commonly referred to 
as a “disk image.” The DMG package has a .dmg extension. It contains the 
main APP file for the software and it may also contain a Read Me file or other 
data files used by the application. Once the download is complete, open 
the DMG file from the Downloads folder and then drag the APP file to your 
Applications folder as shown in Figure 6-31.
	How do I access Mac software after it is installed? On a Mac, 
you can access most software from the Launchpad at the bottom of the

SECTION C, Unit 6
Portable Software
Although the digital world seems to be moving to the cloud, some users feel 
more secure when they can carry apps and data on a flash drive that remains 
in their possession and leaves no footprint locally or online.
	What is portable software? Portable software is designed for PCs 
and it runs from removable storage, such as a USB flash drive. Program files 
are not installed on the hard disk, no configuration data is stored on a local 
device, and no entries need to be made in the Windows Registry. When the 
device containing the portable software is removed from the computer, no 
trace of it is left there. Carrying apps and data on a flash drive makes it pos-
sible to use just about any public or private computer without leaving a data 
trail on the local device or in the cloud.
There are a limited number of portable apps, but the available selection 
covers most essential tasks. Examples of portable applications include 
LibreOffice Portable, Thunderbird (email), Firefox (browser), and FileZilla 
(upload and download).
	How do I install portable software? Portable software is so simple 
to install that it is sometimes referred to as install-free software. Installation 
is simply a matter of getting program files to the media on which they are 
supposed to run. For example, suppose that you want to run LibreOffice 
Portable from a USB flash drive. You can download the LibreOffice Portable 
ZIP file and then simply unzip it so that the files end up on the USB flash 
drive (Figure 6-33).
Download the 
program files to 
your flash drive.

uninstalling software
When your computer seems too cluttered with unneeded demoware and 
unused applications, you can clean house. The process of removing soft-
ware differs for PCs and Macs.
	How do I remove Mac software? Most Mac users simply use Finder 
to locate the program’s APP file or folder and move it to the trash. Some Mac 
programs, such as Adobe Creative Suite applications, include a more thor-
ough uninstall routine, which is usually listed in the Utilities folder.
	How do I get rid of PC software? Removing software from a PC 
is complicated by two factors. First, the process of installing software often 
sprinkles files into various folders, including the System folder, where they 
can be shared with other programs. Second, the Windows Registry must be 
updated when an application is removed.
The Windows operating system includes an uninstall utility, which deletes 
the software’s files from various folders on your computer’s hard disk. The 
uninstall routine helps you decide what to do with shared files that are used 
by more than one program. As a rule, you should leave the shared files in 
place. The Control Panel provides access to the uninstall routine (Figure 
6-34).

office suite Basics 
Office suites, such as Microsoft Office and Google Docs, are popular with 
individuals and in business environments. They are sometimes referred to 
as productivity software because they offer features that really help get 
work done. 
	What is an office suite? An office suite is a collection of programs 
that typically include word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation mod-
ules. Suites may also include email and contact managers, calendars, 
project management, database management, and drawing modules.
In the context of office suites, the term module refers to a component, such 
as a word processing module. Modules can be run as individual programs, 
but all of the modules in an office suite have a standard set of controls, mak-
ing it easy to transfer your expertise on one module to the others. 
	What are the most popular office suites? Popular office suites 
include Google Docs, iWork, LibreOffice, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Office 
Online, and Zoho Office Suite (Figure 6-35).

SECTION D, Unit 6
Word Processing 
Whether you are writing a ten‑page paper, generating software documenta-
tion, designing a brochure, or writing a dissertation, you will probably use 
the word processing module of an office suite. 
	How can software help me with my writing? Word processing 
software has replaced typewriters for producing ­many types of documents, 
including reports, letters, memos, papers, and book manuscripts. Word 
­processing packages, such as Microsoft Word, iWork Pages, and LibreOffice 
Writer, give you the ability to create, spell-check, edit, and format a docu-
ment on the screen before it is finalized. 
A typical word processor window displays a work area, called a workspace, 
that represents a blank piece of paper. The window also includes controls 
for viewing and formatting the document (Figure 6-36).

	How does word processing software help me turn my ideas 
into ­sentences and paragraphs? Word processing software makes it 
easy to let your ideas flow because it automatically handles many tasks that 
might otherwise be distractions. For example, you don’t need to worry about 
fitting words within the margins. A feature called word wrap determines 
how your text flows from line to line by automatically moving words down to 
the next line as you reach the right margin. 
Imagine that the sentences in your document are ribbons of text; word wrap 
bends the ribbons. Changing the margin size just means bending the ribbon 
in ­different places. Even after you type an entire document, adjusting the 
size of the right, left, top, and bottom ­margins is simple.
	Can word processing software help me break bad writing

	Can word processing software improve my writing? Because 
word processing software is geared toward the writing process, it offers sev-
eral features that can improve the quality of your writing. 
Word processing software is likely to include a thesaurus, which can help 
you find a synonym for a word so that you can make your writing more var-
ied and ­interesting. A grammar checker reads through your document and 
points out potential grammatical trouble spots, such as incomplete sen-
tences, run-on sentences, and verbs that don’t agree with nouns.
Your word processing software might also be able to analyze the reading 
level of your document using a standard readability formula, such as the 
Flesch-Kincaid reading level. You can use this analysis to find out if your 
writing level is appropriate for your target audience based on sentence 
length and vocabulary.
Most word processing software includes a spelling checker that marks 
misspelled words in a document. You can easily correct a misspelled word 
as you type, or you can run the spelling checker when you finish entering all 
the text. Some software even has autocorrecting capability; as you type, it 
automatically changes a typo (such as teh) to the correct spelling (the).
Although your software’s spelling checker helps you correct misspellings, 
it cannot guarantee an error-free document. A spelling checker works by 
comparing each word from your document to a list of correctly spelled words 
stored in a data file called a spelling dictionary. If the word from your docu-
ment is in the dictionary, the spelling checker considers the word correctly 
spelled. If the word is not in the dictionary, the word is counted as misspelled. 
Spelling checkers can’t tell if you misuse a word, such as if you use the 
phrase pear of shoes instead of pair of shoes. Also, spelling checkers flag 
many proper nouns and scientific, medical, and technical words because 
they are not included in the spelling checker’s dictionary. Make sure you 
proofread, even after using a spelling checker (Figure 6-37).
A wavy red line indicates a ­possible 
­misspelling. Right-click the word to 
display a shortcut menu that con-
tains suggested ­correct spellings.
A wavy blue line indicates a pos-
sible grammar error. Right-click 
the word to display suggestions.
Use these buttons to ignore a 
word, change a word, or add a 
word to the spelling dictionary.
To check the spelling for an entire 
document, click the Spelling & 
Grammar button on the REVIEW tab.

SECTION D, Unit 6
	How do I get my documents to look good? The term document 
formatting refers to the way that all the elements of a document—text, pic-
tures, titles, and page numbers—are arranged on the page. 
The final format of a document depends on how and where you intend to 
use it. A school paper, for example, simply needs to be produced in stan-
dard paragraph format—perhaps double spaced and with numbered pages. 
A brochure, newsletter, or corporate report, on the other hand, might require 
more ambitious formatting, such as columns, headers, and graphics. 
The look of your final document depends on several formatting factors, such 
as page layout, paragraph style, and font. 
• Layout and headers. Page layout refers to the physical position of each 
element on a page. In addition to paragraphs of text, these elements might 
include margins, page numbers, header text that you specify to auto-
matically appear in the top margin of every page, and footer text that you 
specify to automatically appear in the bottom margin of every page.
• Styles and alignment. Paragraph style includes the alignment of text 
within the margins and the space between each line of text. The vertical 
spacing between lines of text is called leading (pronounced “LED ding”). 
Most documents are single spaced or double spaced, but you can adjust 
line spacing in 1 pt. increments. Paragraph alignment refers to the hori-
zontal position of text—whether it is aligned at the left margin, aligned at the 
right margin, or fully justified so that the text is aligned evenly on both the 
right and left margins. 
• Fonts. A font is a set of ­letters that share a unified design. Font size is mea-
sured as point size, which is abbreviated as pt. One point is about 1/72 of 
an inch. 
Instead of individually selecting font and paragraph style elements, word 
processing software allows you to select a style that lets you apply several 
font and paragraph characteristics with a single click (Figure 6-38). 
1. Select the text to which 
you want to apply the style.
2. Select a style from 
the Styles group on 
the HOME tab.
Figure 6-38: Use Styles for Professional Formatting
In this document, headings were formatted by selecting a style with a single click 
instead of individually selecting a font color, font size, and font style. Now if the 
heading style is changed to green, all the headings will automatically change color.
QuickCheck
In the context of word 
processing, the term leading 
refers to ____________.
a.	 text that automatically 
appears at the top of each 
page
b.	 the feature that automatically 
moves text down when you 
reach the margin
c.	 the size of a font

spreadsheets
Spreadsheet software was initially popular with accountants who dealt with 
paper-based spreadsheets; they found the ­electronic version far easier to 
use and less prone to errors than manual calculations. Other people soon 
discovered the benefits of spreadsheets for projects that require repetitive 
calculations, such as budgeting, computing grades, tracking investments, 
calculating loan payments, and estimating project costs.
	What is a spreadsheet? A spreadsheet uses rows and columns of 
numbers to ­create a model or representation of a real situation. For exam-
ple, your bank statement is a type of spreadsheet because it is a numerical 
representation of cash flowing into and out of your bank account. 
	When do I need spreadsheet software? Spreadsheet soft-
ware, such as Microsoft Excel, iWork Numbers, Google Docs Sheets, and 
LibreOffice Calc, provides tools to create electronic spreadsheets. It is like a 
smart piece of paper that ­automatically adds up columns of numbers written 
on it. 
Spreadsheet calculations are based on equations that you create or more 
complex built-in formulas. Spreadsheet software can turn data into colorful 
graphs. It also includes special data-handling features that sort data, search 
for data that meets specific criteria, and print reports. 
Because it is so easy to experiment with different numbers, spreadsheet 
software is particularly useful for what-if analysis. You can use what-if 
analyses to answer ­questions such as “What if I get an A on my next two 
economics exams? But what if I get only Bs?” or “What if I invest $100 a 
month in my retirement plan? But what if I invest $200 a month?” 
	What does a computerized spreadsheet look like? Spreadsheet 
software can be used to create an on-screen worksheet. A worksheet is 
based on a grid of columns and rows. Each cell in the grid can contain a 
value, label, or formula. A value is a number that you want to use in a calcu-
lation. A label is any text used to describe data (Figure 6-39).
Figure 6-39: Microsoft Excel Basics
Values in these 
cells can be used 
for calculations.
Active cell
A formula in this cell ­subtracts 
the expenses from the income 
to calculate profit.
Cell A1
Labels, such as Total 
Income, identify data.

SECTION D, Unit 6
	Are there formatting options? The labels and values on a work-
sheet can be formatted in much the same way as you would format text in 
a word processing document. You can change fonts and font size, select a 
font color, and select font styles, such as bold, italics, and underline. 
	How does spreadsheet software work? The values contained in a 
cell can be manipulated by formulas placed in other cells. A formula works 
behind the scenes to tell the microprocessor how to use the contents of cells 
in calculations. You can enter a simple formula into a cell to add, subtract, 
multiply, or divide numbers. More complex formulas can be designed to per-
form just about any calculation you can imagine. Figure 6-40 illustrates how 
a formula might be used in a simple spreadsheet to calculate savings.
The formula for cell B6 is 
shown on the Formula bar.
The number that appears in 
cell B6 was calculated by the 
spreadsheet, based on the 
formula typed in the cell.
When a cell contains a formula, it displays the result of the formula rather 
than the formula itself. To view and edit the formula, use the Formula bar. You 
can think of the formula as working behind the scenes to perform calculations 
and then display the result.
	How will I know which formulas to use? To create an effec-
tive and accurate worksheet, you must understand the calculations and 
formulas that are involved. If, for example, you want to create a worksheet 
that calculates your final grade in a course, you need to know the grading 
scale and understand how your instructor plans to weight each assignment 
and test. 
Most spreadsheet software includes a few templates or wizards for pre-
designed ­worksheets, such as invoices, income-expense reports, balance 
sheets, and loan ­payment schedules. Additional templates are available on 
the Web. These templates are designed by professionals and contain all the 
necessary labels and ­formulas. To use a template, simply plug in the values 
for your calculation. 
When creating spreadsheets from scratch, you can enter your own formu-
las or you can select from a series of predefined formulas provided by your 
spreadsheet software.

Figure 6-41: Entering A formula
	What is the format for formulas? A formula, such as =B6+(C6*.1), 
can contain cell references (such as B6 and C6), numbers (such as .1), 
and mathematical operators (such as the multiplication symbol [*], the divi-
sion symbol [/], the addition symbol, and the subtraction symbol). Parts of 
a formula can be enclosed in parentheses to indicate the order in which the 
mathematical operations should be performed. The operation in parenthe-
ses—in this case, (C6*.1)—should be performed first. 
You can simply type the entire formula, or you can use pointer math, which 
adds cell references to the formula as you point to them. Figure 6-41 illus-
trates how to enter a formula into a cell.
	What is the process for entering functions? Spreadsheet soft-
ware provides functions that are set up to perform common calculations, 
such as averages, loan payments, and comparisons. A function is a built-
in preset formula. To use a function, simply select one from a list, as shown 
in Figure 6-42, and then indicate the cell references of any ­values you want 
to include in the calculation.
Figure 6-42: Using Built-in Functions
1. Select the cell 
where the results 
should be displayed.
3. Move the pointer to 
cell B6, then type a + 
symbol.
4. Type the first 
parenthesis.
5. Move the pointer to 
cell C6, then type the 
rest of the formula.

SECTION D, Unit 6
	What happens when I modify a worksheet? When you change 
the contents of any cell in a worksheet, all the formulas are recalculated. 
This automatic recalculation feature ensures that the results in every cell 
are accurate for the ­information currently entered in the worksheet. 
Your worksheet is also automatically updated to reflect any rows or columns 
that you add, delete, or copy within the worksheet. Unless you specify oth-
erwise, a cell reference is a relative reference—that is, a reference that 
can change from B4 to B3, for ­example, if row 3 is deleted and all the data 
moves up one row.
If you don’t want a cell reference to change, you can use an absolute refer-
ence. An absolute reference never changes when you insert rows, or copy 
or move formulas. Understanding when to use absolute references is one 
of the key aspects of developing spreadsheet design expertise. Figure 6-43 
provides additional information about relative and absolute references.

Cell references without $ sym-
bols are relative references. 
They change to reflect the rows 
to which they are copied.
The $ symbols create an abso-
lute reference that does not 
change as the formula is rep-
licated down the column.
The sales tax rate is in cell C1, 
and that cell reference should 
never change in formulas 
that calculate sales tax.
What happens when a formula is not set up with the correct absolute refer-
ences, and it is then copied or moved?
1. The original for-
mula =B5*C2 works 
correctly in cell C5.
2. When the formula is copied to cell C6, the 
relative references in the formula are changed 
to =B6*C3 and no longer refer to the correct 
cells. Cell C3 is blank, so the formula calcu-
lates the result as $153,802*0, or 0.
3. When the formula is copied to cell C7, 
it changes to =B7*C4 and again no longer 
refers to the correct cells. Cell C4 contains 
a label, so the result is a #VALUE! error.
4. When the formula is copied to cell C8, the 
formula changes to =B8*C5. This formula does 
not refer to the correct cells and produces a 
result that is too large to fit in the cell.

cell C5 is =B5*C2. Are B5 and C2 
relative references or absolute 
references?

DATABASEs
A database can contain any sort of data, such as a university’s student 
records, a library’s card catalog, a store’s inventory, an individual’s address 
book, or a utility company’s customers. Databases can be stored on per-
sonal computers, network servers, Web servers, mainframes, and even 
mobile devices.
	What is a database? The term database has evolved from a special-
ized technical term into a part of our everyday vocabulary. In the context of 
modern usage, a database is simply a collection of data that may be stored 
on one or more digital devices. 
	What is database software? Database software helps you enter, 
find, organize, update, and report information stored in a database. Microsoft 
Access, FileMaker Pro, and LibreOffice Base are three examples of popular 
database software for personal computers. Oracle and MySQL are popular 
server database software packages. 
	How does a database store data? Database software stores data 
as a series of records, which are composed of fields that hold data. A record 
holds data for a single entity—a person, place, thing, or event. A field 
holds one item of data relevant to a record. You can envision a record as a 
Rolodex card or an index card. A series of records is often presented as a 
table arranged in rows and columns (Figure 6-44).

	Can a database hold different kinds of records? Some database 
software provides tools to work with more than one collection of records, 
as long as the records are somehow related to each other. For example, 
suppose MTV maintains a database pertaining to jazz music. One series 
of database records might contain data about jazz songs. It could contain 
fields such as song title, performer, and length. 
Another series of records might contain biographical data about jazz per-
formers, including the performer’s name, birth date, and hometown. It might 
even include a field for the performer’s photo. These two sets of records can 
be related by the name of the performing artist, as shown in Figure 6-45.

file Basics
Computer files in digital format offer a compact and convenient way to store 
documents, photos, videos, and music. Computer files have several charac-
teristics, such as a name, format, location, size, and date. To make effective 
use of computer files, you’ll need a good understanding of these file basics.
	What’s important about a file name? File names are the founda-
tion for keeping files organized so that they can be easily located and so 
that old versions don’t get mixed up with new versions. File names should 
be descriptive and versioning must be clear. For example, if you anticipate 
several revisions to a report, add a version number, such as Report v1.docx, 
to the file name. Save the next version of the report as Report v2.docx. 
You then have the original version in case you want to retrieve some of the 
material it contains.
	Are there rules for naming files? As you learned in Unit 1, a com-
puter file—or simply a file—is defined as a named collection of data that 
exists on a storage medium, such as a hard disk, cloud drive, or USB flash 
drive. When saving a file, you must provide a valid file name that adheres 
to specific rules, referred to as file-naming conventions. The conventions 
vary slightly from one operating system to another. However, because file 
sharing is so prevalent, the conventions in Figure 6-48 represent best prac-
tices for naming files on any platform.
Maximum length is 256 characters. Current versions of 
Windows and Mac OS support file names up to 255 characters long. In 
practice, some of the 255 characters are used for the file’s drive letter, 
folder designation, and extension, so the name you assign to a file 
should be much shorter. A file name limitation of 255 characters gives 
you the flexibility to use descriptive file names, such as Household 
Budget 2014, so that you can easily identify what a file contains. 
Avoid using symbols. If an operating system attaches special 
significance to a symbol, you cannot use it in a file name. For 
example, Windows uses the colon (:) character to separate the 
device letter from a file name or folder, as in C:Music. A file name 
that contains a colon, such as Report:2014, is not valid because the 
operating system would become confused about how to ­interpret the 
colon. Avoid using the symbols  * \ < > | “ /  : and ? in file names. 
Do not use reserved words. Some operating systems also 
contain a list of reserved words that are used as commands or special 
identifiers. You cannot use these words alone as a file name. You can, 
however, use these words as part of a longer file name. For example, 
in Windows, the file name Nul would not be valid, but you could name 
a file something like Null Set.exe. The following words should not 
be used as file names: Aux, Com1, Com2, Com3, Com4, Con, Lpt1, 
Lpt2, Lpt3, Prn, and Nul.
Case is disregarded. Some operating systems are case sensitive, 
but those that you regularly work with on personal computers are not. 
A file named Final Report is the same as FINAL REPORT or final 
report.
Spaces are allowed. You can use spaces in file names. That’s a 
different rule than for email addresses, where spaces are not allowed. 
You’ve probably noticed that people often use underscores or periods 
instead of spaces in email addresses such as Madi_Jones@msu.
edu. That convention is not necessary in file names, so a file name 
such as Letter to Edison Jones is valid.

SECTION E, Unit 6
	What are storage device designations? Files can be saved on 
internal storage devices as well as on external devices and in the cloud. 
Knowing the location of a file is the key to retrieving it. Every storage location 
has a name, such as C:, JacksHD, DropBox, Macintosh HD, or SanDiskUSB. 
The storage location name may identify the location of the device, its type, or 
its owner. 
When working with Windows, storage devices can also be identified by a 
device letter. The main hard disk drive is referred to as drive C. A device let-
ter is usually followed by a colon, so C: is typically the designation for a hard 
disk drive. Removable storage devices are assigned drive letters when they 
are inserted. For example, Removable Disk (E:) might be the designation for 
a USB drive.
Drive letters are a legacy of DOS, which is why they remain in use in 
Windows but not on Macs. Macs do not use drive letters. Every storage 
device on Macs has a name. The main hard disk is called Macintosh HD. 
Figure 6-49 illustrates how devices might be designated on a PC.
Figure 6-49: Storage Device Designations
	What is a disk partition? A disk partition is a section of a hard disk 
drive that is treated as a separate storage unit. Most hard drives are config-
ured with a single partition that contains the operating system, programs, 
and data. However, it is possible to create more than one hard disk partition, 
each with a separate name and device letter. Partitions are created, modi-
fied, and deleted using Disk Utility on Macs and Disk Management on PCs.
Based on the screenshot in Figure 6-49, the computer might appear to have 
two hard disk drives: C: and D:. However, in reality, it has one drive divided 
into two partitions. In such an arrangement, backing up files from C: to D: 
wouldn’t offer protection in case of a hard disk failure because C: and D: are 
the same physical storage device.
Disk partitions help to separate programs from data files. For example, a PC 
might have one partition for operating system files and another partition for 
programs and data. This arrangement can speed up the process of disin-
fecting a computer that has been attacked by malicious software.
For desktop and laptop 
computers, the hard disk is 
the main storage device.
Network storage provides 
access to the hard drives 
of other computers.
Files stored on a USB flash 
drive are easy to transport 
to other computers.
Cloud-based loca-
tions store files on 
an Internet-based 
storage service.

medium, or a portion of a 
storage medium, such as a

	What is a folder? Every storage device has a directory containing 
a list of its files. The main directory is referred to as the root directory. A 
root directory can be subdivided into smaller lists. Each list is called a sub-
directory. Each subdirectory is depicted as a folder. 
Folders help you envision files as if they were stored in a filing cabinet. Each 
folder can hold related items—for example, a set of documents, sound clips, 
financial data, or photos for a school project. Windows provides a folder 
called Documents that you might use to hold reports, letters, and so on. 
You can also create and name folders to meet your needs, such as a folder 
called QuickBooks to hold personal finance data. 
Folders can be created within other folders. You might, for example, create 
a Jazz folder within your Music folder to hold a collection of jazz tracks and 
another folder named Reggae to hold your reggae music collection.
A folder name is separated from a drive letter and other folder names by a 
special symbol. In Microsoft Windows, this symbol is the backslash (\). For 
example, the folder for your reggae music (within the Music folder on drive 
C) would be ­written as C:\Music\Reggae. Other operating systems use a 
forward slash (/) to separate folders.
	What is a file path? A computer file’s location is defined by a file 
path, which on a PC includes the drive letter, folder(s), file name, and exten-
sion. Suppose that you have stored an MP3 file called Marley One Love in 
the Reggae folder on your hard disk. Its file specification is shown in Figure 
6-50, along with a table of common file extensions.

file Management tools
Operating systems provide file organization tools called file management 
utilities. Windows offers a utility called File Explorer, which is launched 
from the 
 icon on the taskbar. OS X offers a utility called Finder, which is 
launched from the 
 icon on the dock.
	What’s in the file management utility window? File Explorer 
and Finder have many similarities. Although the icons are different, the 
general functions, features, and layouts are comparable. The examples in

SECTION E, Unit 6
	 What can I do with folders and files? File management utilities 
are useful for locating files and for viewing their contents. Selecting a data 
file by double-clicking it or tapping it opens the file and its corresponding 
software application. The software application associated with a specific 
file type is called a default application. For example, the Paint applica-
tion might be the default application for all PNG files, so when you select a 
file such as Sunset.png, the operating system automatically opens it using 
Paint.
But what if the operating system opens a file using an application that is not 
the one you want to use? Suppose that Windows opens a photo in Paint but 
you want to view it in Photoshop. Or what if OS X opens a photo in Viewer 
instead of Photoshop? You can select the application that you want to use 
by right-clicking the file and then selecting the application from a list.
You can also tell the operating system that you’d like to make a permanent 
change in the application that is used to open files of a specific type. For 
example, if you’d like to open all PNG files with Photoshop, follow the pro-
cedure in Figure 6-53.
Figure 6-53: Changing the default application
On a PC, open Control Panel and choose 
Default Programs. Use the Associations 
link to locate the extension, then select 
an application as the default using the 
Change program button.
On a Mac, right-click any program 
with the extension you want to 
work with. Select Get Info. Use the 
Open With option to select the new 
default application, then select the 
button labeled Change All.

	 What else can I do with file management utilities? In addition 
to locating files and folders, file management utilities help you manipulate 
files and folders in the following ways:
• Rename. You can change the name of a file or folder to better describe its 
contents. 
• Copy. You can copy a file from one device to another—for example, from a 
USB drive to the hard disk drive. You can also make a copy of a document 
so that you can revise the copy and leave the original intact.
• Move. You can move a file from one folder to another or from one storage 
device to another. When you move a file, it is erased from its original loca-
tion, so make sure you remember the new location of the file. You can also 
move an entire folder and its contents from one storage device to another 
storage device or to a different folder.
• Delete. You can delete a file when you no longer need it. You can also 
delete a ­folder. Be careful when you delete a folder because most file man-
agement utilities also delete all the files within a folder.
	 Can I work with more than one file or folder at a time? To 
work with a group of files or folders, you must first select them. You can 
accomplish this task in several ways. You can hold down the Ctrl key 
(Command key on the Mac) as you click each item. This method works well 
if you are selecting files or folders that are not listed consecutively. 
As an alternative, you can hold down the Shift key while you click the first 
item and the last item you want to select. By using the Shift key method, 
you select the two items that you clicked and all the items in between. After 
a group of items is selected, you can use the same copy, move, or delete 
procedure that you would use for a single item.
	 What are personal folders? Windows and OS X offer a set of pre-
configured personal folders, such as Documents and Music, for storing your 
personal data files. These folders may not be displayed initially because 
Microsoft and Apple would prefer consumers to use cloud storage services. 
For files that you want to store locally, these preconfigured files are a good 
start, so add them to your favorites list and they will be easy to access 
(Figure 6-54). 
Figure 6-54: personal folders on PCs and Macs
On a PC, open the option for This PC, 
then drag the Music, Pictures, and 
Videos folders to the Favorites area 
of File Explorer.
On a Mac, use Finder to open the 
icon for Macintosh HD, then drag 
the icons for Movies, Music, and 
Pictures to the Favorites area.

SECTION E, Unit 6
	What are file management best practices? A file management 
utility provides tools and procedures to help you keep track of your pro-
gram and data files. However, these tools are most useful when you have 
a logical plan for organizing your files and when you follow some basic file 
management guidelines. Consider the tips in Figure 6-55 for managing files 
on your own computer. When working with files on lab computers, follow the 
guidelines from your instructor or lab manager.
• Use descriptive names. Give your files and folders descriptive 
names, and avoid using cryptic abbreviations. 
• Maintain file extensions. When renaming a file, keep the original file 
extension so that it can be opened with the correct application soft-
ware.
• Group similar files. Separate files into folders based on subject mat-
ter. For example, store your creative writing assignments in one folder 
and your MP3 music files in another folder.
• Organize your folders from the top down. When devising a hierar-
chy of folders, consider how you want to access files and back them 
up. For example, it is easy to specify one folder and its subfolders for a 
backup. If your important data is scattered in a variety of folders, how-
ever, making backups is more time-consuming. 
• Consider using default folders. You should use preconfigured 
personal folders, such as Documents and Music, as your main data 
folders. Add subfolders to these personal folders as necessary to orga-
nize your files.
• Use Public folders for files you want to share. Use the Public fold-
ers for files that you want to share with other network users.
• Don’t mix data files and program files. Do not store data files in the 
folders that hold your software. Most soft­ware is stored in subfolders of 
the Program Files folder on Windows systems and in the Applications 
folder on Macs.
• Don’t store files in the root directory. Although it is acceptable to 
create folders in the root directory, it’s not a good practice to store pro-
grams or data files in the root directory of your computer’s hard disk.
• Access files from the hard disk. For best performance, copy files 
from USB drives or CDs to your computer’s hard disk before accessing 
them.
• Follow copyright rules. When copying files, make sure you adhere to 
copyright and license restrictions.
• Delete or archive files you no longer need. Deleting unneeded files 
and folders helps keep your list of files from growing to an unmanage-
able size.
• Be aware of storage locations. When you save files, be sure to spec-
ify the correct storage device and folder.
• Back up! Back up your folders and files regularly.

application-based file management
Applications include menu options for opening and saving files. In fact, 
applications call the operating system’s file management routines to get the 
job done. That is the reason the Save window provided by an application 
looks so similar to the file management utility window.
	What should I know about saving files? Applications generally 
provide a way to open files and save them in a specific folder on a des-
ignated storage device. Some applications also allow you to delete and 
rename files. Saving files is easy. Simply use the Save option provided by 
your application, specify a location for the file, and give it a name. Most 
applications allow you to create a new folder and add tags to a file during 
the save process (Figure 6-56).
1. Select a storage device 
and folder to ­indicate 
where you want the new 
folder created.
2. Click the New 
folder button.
3. Enter a name for 
the new folder.

SECTION E, Unit 6
physical file storage
The structure of files and folders displayed by File Explorer is called a logi-
cal storage model because it helps you create a mental picture of the way 
files are organized in a hierarchy of folders. A physical storage model 
describes what actually happens on the disks and in the circuits. As you will 
see, the physical model is quite different from the logical model.
	How is data stored? Before a computer can store a file, the storage 
medium must be formatted. The formatting process creates the equivalent 
of electronic storage bins. Magnetic and optical media are divided into cir-
cular tracks and then further divided into pie-shaped sectors. Solid state 
storage media are divided into units.
	How does the operating system keep track of a file’s loca-
tion? The operating system uses a file system to keep track of the names 
and locations of files that reside on a storage medium, such as a hard 
disk. Different operating systems use different file systems. For example, 
OS X uses the Macintosh Hierarchical File System Plus (HFS+). Microsoft 
Windows uses a file system called NTFS (New Technology File System). 
To speed up the process of storing and retrieving data, a disk drive usually 
works with a group of sectors called a cluster or a block. A file system’s pri-
mary task is to maintain a list of clusters and keep track of which are empty 
and which hold data. This information is stored in an index file.
When you save a file, the operating system looks at the index file to see 
which clusters are empty. It selects one of these empty clusters, records the 
file data there, and then revises the index file to include the new file name 
and its location.
A file that does not fit into a single cluster spills over into an adjacent cluster 
unless that cluster already contains data. When an adjacent cluster is not 
available, the operating system stores parts of a file in nonadjacent clusters. 
Figure 6-57 helps you visualize how an index file keeps track of file names 
and locations.

	What happens when a file is deleted? When you click a file’s icon 
and then select the Delete option, you might have visions of the read-write 
head somehow scrubbing out the clusters that contain data. That doesn’t 
happen. Instead, the operating system simply changes the status of the 
file’s clusters to “empty” and removes the file name from the index file. The 
file name no longer appears in a directory listing, but the file’s data remains 
in the clusters until a new file is stored there. 
	Can deleted files be undeleted? The Windows Recycle Bin and 
similar utilities in other operating systems are designed to protect you from 
accidentally deleting hard disk files you actually need. Instead of marking a 
file’s clusters as empty, the operating system moves the file to the Recycle 
Bin folder. The deleted file still takes up space on the disk but does not 
appear in the usual directory listing. 
Files in the Recycle Bin folder can be undeleted so that they again appear 
in the regular directory. In addition, the Recycle Bin can be emptied to per-
manently delete any files it contains. 
	What happens when I empty the Recycle Bin? When the 
Recycle Bin is emptied, the index file marks the clusters containing deleted 
files as “empty” and the file name is removed from all directory listings. The 
old data remains in the clusters, however, until it is overwritten by other 
files. Various third-party utilities can recover a lot of this supposedly deleted 
data. Law enforcement agents, for example, use these utilities to gather 
evidence from deleted files on the computer disks of suspected criminals.
To delete data from a disk in such a way that no one can ever read it, you 
can use special file shredder software that overwrites supposedly empty 
sectors with random 1s and 0s. This software is handy if you plan to donate 
your computer to a charitable organization and you want to make sure your 
personal data no longer remains on the hard disk.

Issue: How Serious Is Software Piracy?
Software is easy to steal. You 
don’t have to walk out of a Best Buy store with a box 
of expensive software under your shirt. You can sim-
ply copy the software from your friend’s digital device 
or download it from BitTorrent. It seems so simple that 
it couldn’t be illegal. But it is.
Software counterfeiting is the large-scale illegal dupli-
cation of software distribution media and sometimes 
even its packaging. According to Microsoft, many 
software counterfeiting groups are linked to orga-
nized crime and money-laundering schemes that 
fund a diverse collection of illegal activities, such 
as smuggling, gambling, extortion, and prostitution. 
Counterfeit software is sold in retail 
stores and through online auc-
tions—often the packaging looks so 
authentic that buyers have no idea 
they have purchased illegal goods.
Internet piracy uses the Web as 
a way to illegally distribute unau-
thorized software. In Net jargon, 
the terms appz and warez (pro-
nounced as “wares” or “war EZ”) 
refer to pirated software. Some warez have even 
been modified to eliminate serial numbers, registra-
tion requirements, expiration dates, or other forms of 
copy protection. Web sites, file sharing networks, and 
auction sites sell or distribute hundreds of thousands 
of pirated software products. 
In many countries, including the United States, soft-
ware pirates are subject to civil lawsuits for monetary 
damages and criminal prosecution, which can result 
in jail time and stiff fines. Nonetheless, studies seem 
to indicate that about 43% of computer software is not 
properly licensed. According to a Business Software 
Alliance (BSA) and IDC Piracy Study, $82 billion of 
software was legitimately purchased worldwide, but 
software worth a whopping $63 billion was pirated. 
Piracy statistics seem to indicate a rampant problem, 
but aggregating the data worldwide hides the real 
story. A look at geographical regions and individual 
countries is much more revealing.
For example, in the United States, software piracy 
has been in a steady decline. The Compliance Gap, 
a 2014 BSA software survey, reveals that only 18% 
of software used by U.S. consumers was pirated. In 
Japan, the rate has reached an all-time low of 19%, 
and Western European countries are not far behind 
with a 24% rate. In contrast, Zimbabwe has a 91% 
piracy rate. In Iraq the rate is 86%, and in Ukraine it is 
83%. China has a piracy rate of 74%.
Factors such as income levels, law enforcement, and 
educational outreach are likely to affect the discrep-
ancies in piracy rates among regions and countries. 
Countries with the lowest income levels tend to 
have the highest piracy rates. Software priced for 
developed countries may be beyond the reach of con-
sumers in emerging nations. 
The industry, too, is changing. 
The price tag for consumer-level 
software rarely exceeds $100. 
Expensive software titles such 
as Microsoft Office and Adobe 
Creative Suite are offered via 
monthly subscriptions. Affordable 
software reduces one of the main 
incentives to seek pirated software.
The popularity of mobile devices also has had an 
effect on software piracy. Most mobile apps cost just 
a few dollars, and many of them are free. They are 
available primarily from app stores that make piracy 
difficult. Consumers who legitimately purchase low-
cost apps for their mobile devices tend not to seek 
pirated versions for their full-size computers.
And consumer tastes are changing. Software piracy 
has become a drop in the bucket compared to the tide 
of content infringement. On BitTorrent, for example, 
only 4% of pirated content is software. BitTorrent 
users are far more interested in pirated movies, 
television shows, and pornography. Similar statis-
tics represent infringing behavior at venues such as 
Usenet and cloud storage services.
As piracy heads in new directions in developed coun-
tries, the issue of emerging nations still remains. 
Some industry analysts believe that productivity gains 
from using pirated software do not offset gains that 
might be made if software was legitimately licensed. 
That argument may be hard to justify, however, to 
cash-strapped consumers in emerging nations.
Web sites, file sharing 
networks, and auction 
sites sell or distribute 
hundreds of thousands 
of pirated software 
products.

1. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the seriousness of software piracy?
2. Do you know of any instances of software piracy?
3. Do you think that most software pirates understand that they are doing something 
illegal?
4. Should software publishers try to adjust their software pricing for local markets? 
What Do You Think?
 ISSUE
TRY IT! Is software piracy becoming irrelevant as consumer focus turns to 
content infringement? Explore the issue by completing the TRY IT! activities. Your 
instructor can specify how to submit your findings.
	 To find out if software piracy is increasing, connect to www.bsa.org, look at the 
most recent Global Software Study, then answer the following questions:
	
a. What time period does the study cover?
	
b. Did software piracy increase or decrease during this time period, and if so, by 
how much? 
	
c. Which regions had the highest and lowest piracy rates?
	
d. Which countries had the three highest piracy rates, and what percentage of 
software is pirated in these countries?
	 As a justification of high piracy rates, some observers point out that people in 
many countries simply might not be able to afford software that is priced for 
the U.S. market. Find the current retail price for Microsoft Office in the United 
States. Next, find the average annual income for Bangladesh. Divide the price 
by the average annual income to calculate the percentage of a Bangladeshi’s 
income that would be required to purchase Microsoft Office. What percentage of 
a Bangladeshi’s income would he or she have to pay to get Microsoft Office at 
the full retail U.S. price? 
	 The incidence of piracy seems to be higher among small businesses and indi-
vidual users than corporations and government agencies. According to one 
study, two-thirds of college and university students see nothing unethical about 
swapping or downloading digital copyrighted software, music, and movie files 
without paying for them, and more than half of the people surveyed for the study 
believe it is acceptable to do so in the workplace. Perhaps education is part of 
the solution; more publicity about the cost of piracy might encourage people to 
stop using illegal software. Search YouTube for software piracy or anti-piracy 
ads, then complete the following: 
	
a. List the titles and links for the three ads that you consider most effective.
	
b. List the title and link for an anti-piracy video that college students would con-
sider “lame.”
	 An organization called SIIA (Software & Information Industry Association) has 
been active in efforts to reduce software piracy. Visit the organization’s site at 
www.siia.net and explore the resources offered there. How much emphasis is 
placed on software piracy compared to content infringement? Support your con-
clusion with examples.

SECTION A, Unit 6
It wasn’t too long ago that software arrived in a box that contained a CD and a lengthy printed manual. This 
documentation included a detailed description of every feature as well as tutorials and troubleshooting guides. 
Today, printed manuals have been replaced by a variety of online documentation. Finding and using it is a skill 
that is sometimes referred to as documentation literacy. You can use documentation like a pro by following a 
few easy guidelines.
Know what you are using. 
Make sure you know the name of 
the software that you are using, 
the software publisher, and the 
software version. To find this infor-
mation on Macs, look at the About 
option on the software menu. On 
PCs, use the About option on the 
Help menu.
Use the Help menu. The Help 
menu is a great tool for learn-
ing how to use specific features 
of the software. From the Help 
menu you can expect to find:
• A searchable list or an index of 
help topics
• Links to online tutorials and help 
resources provided by the soft-
ware publisher
Find the publisher’s online 
documentation. An online user 
manual can include an overview 
of the software, information about 
system requirements, technical 
information about the software, 
and instructions for using each 
feature. Some documentation is 
very extensive; use the Table of 
Contents, index, and Search box 
to quickly find the information you 
seek. Don’t spend too much time 
paging through a lengthy user 
manual. Your time might be spent 
more efficiently by looking else-
where. 
Check YouTube. When looking 
for a “getting started” tutorial or a 
walkthrough of how to use a spe-
cific software feature, YouTube is 
a good resource. You may also 
find software reviews that are 
helpful when deciding whether 
the software is worth download-
ing. Some software videos on 
YouTube are created by the soft-
ware publisher, whereas others 
are created by unaffiliated users. 
Video tutorials tend to be accu-
rate because they are recorded 
using the actual software. Their 
quality can vary, however. If mul-
tiple videos on the same topic 
are available, don’t hesitate to 
bail out of a low-quality produc-
tion. Product reviews posted 
on YouTube may be biased, 
so cross-check with other user 
reviews. 
Use a search engine. For trou-
bleshooting, a search engine may 
be your best resource. Entering 
a general search that includes 
the software product name, such 
as LibreOffice help or Photoshop 
help, usually yields results from 
the software publisher’s online 
help resources. 
Visit online forums. Popular 
software spawns user forums. 
Some are independent, whereas 
others are sponsored by the soft-
ware’s publisher. Independent 
forums are a good source of 
troubleshooting information—
especially for problems that 
the software publisher would 
prefer to ignore. You can find 
forums by entering a query such 
as LibreOffice user group or 
Photoshop discussion forum. 
Additionally, Web sites like 
AllExperts and Instructables can 
provide tutorials and answers to 
specific questions about software. 
Keep notes. Write down error 
messages. Enter the text of 
the error message in a Google 
search along with the name of 
the troublesome software prod-
uct and your device’s operating 
system. When you find a solution, 
pay it forward and post the fix on 
an appropriate online forum.
Evaluate before you imple-
ment. Not all of the information 
you find in user forums is accu-
rate or up to date. Be especially 
careful when troubleshooting 
malware because some mal-
ware “fixes” introduce even more 
malware. Before implementing 
instructions for fixing a prob-
lem, cross-check the solution by 
searching further. Look for users 
who have successfully imple-
mented the instructions. Also, 
make sure the instructions per-
tain to the software and operating 
system versions you are using. 
The information from moderated 
or software publishers’ forums is 
more likely to be accurate than 
information from non-moderated 
forums.

TRY IT! As the amount of online information grows, more and more 
of it becomes outdated. When troubleshooting software, outdated infor-
mation can be useless. Let’s take a look at the assortment of software 
documentation available online.
	 Suppose that you are curious about Chromebooks. Would one be a 
useful addition to your digital device collection? Use a search engine 
to locate the Reddit discussion group for Chromebooks. Then look for 
the Chromebook forum at Google. How would you characterize the 
discussion topics at each of these sites? How would you characterize 
the expertise of participants?
	 Chromebooks have no way to connect a printer cable. What if you 
want to print something from a Chromebook? Go to YouTube and 
search for Chromebook printing. Watch at least three videos on the 
topic. For each video, record its URL and evaluate its quality.
	 What if you want to use your Chromebook offline to compose docu-
ments and spreadsheets? Is it possible to do so? What do you need to 
consider if you plan to edit documents using Google Docs and Google 
Drive offline? What is the most frequent problem that other people 
seem to have when attempting this? Use a search engine to locate 
information on this topic. Record what you find and where you find it.
	 A dynamic dashboard collects data from a spreadsheet and displays 
it in chart format, updating the charts on the fly as new data arrives. 
Locate an online tutorial about dynamic dashboards and attempt to fol-
low the instructions to create one with at least four data sets (graphs). 
Record the URL for the tutorial. Submit your completed dashboard 
file along with a short rating and review of the tutorial. In your review, 
include information about the clarity and completeness of the tutorial.
	 Find the software publisher’s documentation for an open source pro-
gram called GIMP. What does the GIMP application do? Does the 
publisher’s documentation include a tutorial or FAQs? Are there help 
groups?
	 Find tutorials and help resources for GIMP other than those supplied 
by the GIMP Web site. Give examples of at least three additional online 
GIMP resources. Can you locate instructions at any one of these sites 
for isolating an image from its background so that the “cut out” image  
could be overlaid on a different background? Write out the steps for 
doing so.

A cluster of workers in hardhats 
study a dog-eared blueprint. Sun-bronzed laborers 
perch on a makeshift bench, munching sandwiches 
and waving to a group of carpenters hauling 2x4s 
onto a foundation. The sounds of hammers, shov-
els, and power tools fill the air from early morning 
through late afternoon. It is a typical construction 
site: an anthill of activity where a structure of some 
sort is eventually assembled—a house, a shopping 
mall, or a skyscraper.
Behind the scenes of this busy site, digital technol-
ogy has added a high-tech flavor to construction proj-
ects with real-time interactive graphics, broadband 
wireless communications, distributed database man-
agement systems, wearable and ­vehicle-mounted 
computers, global positioning satellites, and laser-
guided surveying systems. 
Architects use computers to create blueprints. 
Contractors use computers for cost estimates and 
scheduling. Computers are even starting to appear 
on the job site, carried as handheld devices and 
embedded in construction equipment.
In the past, architects drew construction plans by 
hand on semitransparent film called vellum. To cre-
ate a blueprint, they overlaid the vellum on special 
blue paper and then ran it through a machine that 
exposed it to intensified light and ammonia. Minor 
changes to a design were possible; but for major 
changes, architects often needed to create a new set 
of vellum drawings. 
With the advent of computers and computer-aided 
design (CAD) software, architects realized they could 
be more productive—and make design changes 
more easily—by replacing their drafting tables with 
computers running CAD software. Using plotters 
with wide print beds, architects are able to produce 
computer-generated blueprints similar to those they 
created at a drafting table. 
Initially, architects used CAD software to create 2-D 
floor plans and elevations. Today, architects use 3-D 
CAD software that offers a greatly expanded tool-
set. Architects can begin with a simple 2-D floor plan 
and then use CAD tools to draw interior and exterior 
walls, ceilings, and roofs. Standard building materi-
als, such as doors and windows, can be selected 
from a list of clip-art objects and dragged into posi-
tion with a mouse. Electrical, plumbing, and framing 
schematics can also be added. 
Any elements of the drawing can be displayed or hid-
den—for example, when discussing the design with 
an electrical contractor, an architect can hide the 
plumbing details. These 3-D wireframe drawings with 
building, electrical, and plumbing elements included 
can be rotated and viewed from any angle. 
Inexpensive ink jet printers have replaced expensive 
first-generation plotters and give architects the option 
of printing in realistic color. Using 3-D CAD software, 
they can also apply textures and colors to convert 
wireframes into 3-D models that can be viewed from 
the inside or outside. Architects sometimes use an 
animated version of a 3-D model for virtual reality 
walkthroughs. 
After an architect has completed the building plans, a 
contractor estimates the project’s price tag by calcu-
lating the cost of materials and labor. Computerized 
spreadsheets, such as Excel, are a popular tool for 
cost estimates. Large contracting firms often use 
commercial software specifically designed for con-
struction estimates.

Contractors are also responsible for scheduling the 
tasks in a construction project, such as excavating 
the building site, erecting the foundation, construct-
ing the frame, assembling the roof, adding wiring 
and plumbing, and doing interior finish work. Large 
construction projects, such as malls and government 
buildings, can involve thousands of tasks and many 
subcontractors. 
Computerized scheduling tools, such as Gantt 
charts, PERT diagrams, and work breakdown sched-
uling software, make it possible to plan and track 
each construction phase and break a project down 
into a series of tasks. For each task, planners enter 
its estimated duration and how it relates to other 
tasks. For example, drywall work that requires eight 
days depends on interior framing, electrical work, 
and plumbing being finished first. Given information 
about all the tasks in a project, planning software can 
create a master schedule showing both best-case 
and worst-case completion dates, and contractors 
can easily update the schedule based on actual con-
struction progress.
At a high-tech construction site, computers can play 
several roles. A site supervisor can use a wireless 
handheld computer to view and update the construc-
tion schedule stored on a desktop computer at the 
contractor’s main office. Rather than refer to a set of 
printed—and possibly outdated—plans, the supervi-
sor can refer to up-to-date plans transmitted from the 
home office. A supervisor might even wear a hard-
hat-mounted computer that collects multimedia data, 
such as video and sound, to document site inspec-
tions. A voice-activated microphone records the 
supervisor’s comments and adds them to the digital 
video, which can be uploaded to a database in the 
contractor’s main office.
Digital devices also play a role in guiding bulldoz-
ers during site preparation by using construction 
software developed at Ohio State University that 
works with a global positioning system (GPS). A GPS 
receiver is mounted on a vehicle that traverses the 
site. GPS signals are collected and entered in the 
software program, which creates a map and a plan 
for site preparation. A wireless device mounted in 
each bulldozer’s cab receives data from the software 
and displays it to the operator. The system allows 
construction crews to stake and grade a site with to-
the-centimeter accuracy.
Computers embedded in robots are used exten-
sively on large construction projects in Japan. 
These ­single-task robots perform specific jobs. For 
example, a concrete-task robot might lay forms, 
bend rebar, pour concrete, and screed the surface 
to a smooth finish. Other robots weld steel compo-
nents, apply paint, or install tile. Single-task robots 
have been successful because they shield human 
workers from dangerous and difficult jobs, and tend 
to work faster and more consistently than humans. 
However, trained technicians are required to set up 
and monitor robot work.
Although construction robots are widely used in 
Japan, they aren’t popular with contractors in many 
other parts of the world. Industry observers speculate 
that Japan’s shortage of unskilled laborers differenti-
ates it from countries where labor is readily available 
and relatively inexpensive. In the United States, for 
example, it is a long-standing summer tradition for 
college students to work in construction—but one 
that might be changing. In a recent survey, students 
viewed construction work as dirty and undesirable 
and, out of 252 career choices, ranked it as number 
251. 
Construction robots might help fill the labor gap in 
countries such as the United States, but potential 
barriers, such as union regulations, could discour-
age their use. Some observers question how building 
trade union agreements might affect construction 
site robots. According to one supervisor’s worst-case 
scenario, “Millwrights will want to set up the device, 
electricians will want to fix the electronic controls, 
equipment operators will want to run it, cement fin-
ishers will want to adjust it, and laborers will be 
expected to clean it.” The future of computer-pow-
ered robots at construction sites is still unclear, which 
illustrates the controversies that sometimes surround 
technology as it filters into society and the workplace.

Flipped Class Projects
Critical Thinking
Free content. Free software. Freemium pricing 
models. Viral popularity. Disappearing gatekeep-
ers. These are the disrupters of the digital age. 
They affect software as well as digital content. But 
what is the endgame? Will these disrupters lead 
to a cultural renaissance or to a cultural dark age? 
Watch the YouTube video titled “PressPausePlay.” 
What are the two opposing viewpoints it presents? 
What is your perspective on the issue?
Group Project
Form a group with at least two of your classmates. 
Now imagine that your college (or business) has 
decided to negotiate with software publishers to 
offer students (or employees) a bundled software 
package at a greatly discounted price. Your group’s 
job is to select the 15 software products for the 
bundle. Your group must make sure the software 
effectively meets the major needs of the students at 
your school (or employees in your workplace). Use 
Internet resources to look at the range of software 
available and make your selections. Make sure you 
take advantage of group members’ expertise and 
experience with software products. 
Cyberclassroom
Mobile apps used for educational activities are 
called mlearning apps. Do you use mobile flash-
cards? Have you downloaded a periodic table to 
your Android phone? Do you have a link to a ref-
erence portal or academic journal handy? Is your 
mobile device helping you to learn a second lan-
guage? Do you have a stash of articles pertaining 
to your major field? Does your phone hold a list of 
assignments and due dates? Work in groups of two 
or three to share the mlearning apps that you use. 
Brainstorm ways you can use generic apps, such 
as Notes, Reminders, and Calendar, for mlearning.
Multimedia Project
Create an infographic that offers ten best prac-
tices for computer file management. You can base 
your infographic on the tips in Figure 6-55. To get 
started, browse the Web for some examples and 
ideas. You’ll also find several free apps for creating 
infographics online, or use your favorite graphics 
software.
Resume Builder
Use the Web and other resources to compile a list 
of the software used in your current or future career 
field. Are there standard software products that job 
applicants need to know how to use? If so, what 
can you find out about those products on the Web? 
If your career field does not use any standard soft-
ware products, explain why you think that is the 
case. Also, make a list of the software products 
you’re familiar with. As you consider your school 
and career goals for the next year, list at least five 
additional software applications you would like to 
learn. Explain why they would be helpful.
Globalization
Computer games are big business. They are 
exported worldwide and accessed by communi-
ties of online players around the globe. For this 
project, gather information about the most interna-
tionally popular computer games. Try some of them 
yourself to see what they’re all about. What effect, 
if any, would you expect these games to have on 
individual players living in the cultures of 1) indus-
trialized countries, 2) Middle Eastern countries, and 
3) developing countries? Summarize your ideas in 
one or two pages.

Interactive Summary
SECTION B: 
 operating systems—
such as Windows, Chrome OS and OS, X—accommodate 
one user at a time, are capable of multitasking, and include 
a graphical user interface designed for keyboard and mouse 
input. Chrome OS is considered a thin 
 
because it depends substantially on processing supplied 
by a remote computer. 
 operating 
systems, such as iOS and Android, are designed for smart-
phones and tablet computers. 
 operating 
systems, such as UNIX and Linux, are designed for hosting 
distributed networks. A single device can run more than one 
operating as a(n) 
 machine. The oper-
ating system 
 remains in RAM while a 
device is in operation and manages the device’s resources. 
Most operating systems have 
 capabili-
ties that allow two or more processes to run simultaneously. 
 capabilities allow an operating system 
to run multiple simultaneous operations for a single program. 
 supports a division of labor among sev-
eral processing units. Operating systems manage resources by 
monitoring processor cycles, allocating 
 
space to programs, tracking stored files, and supervising data 
exchanges with peripheral devices. When an operating system 
fails to correctly track the allocation of RAM space to applica-
tions, a memory 
 may produce “Program 
Not Responding” error messages. Operating systems also 
manage 
 that collect and hold data from 
peripheral devices until a device is ready to accept it. 
SECTION A: Both 
 software and 
application software are essential for accomplishing tasks 
with a digital device. Today, application software is distrib-
uted online. The main executable file for PC software has a(n) 
 extension, whereas executable files for 
Macs have a(n) 
 extension. New ver-
sions of software are called 
 and are 
indicated by version numbers such as 1.0 and 2.0. A software 
 or patch is a small section of program 
code designed to correct problems and address security vulner-
abilities. Software pricing models include one-time purchase, 
 , trial, and freemium. Software licenses, 
referred to by the acronym 
, can be 
divided into two main categories: public 
 
and proprietary. 
 software is usually 
sold in retail stores or at Web sites and may have options 
for site licenses as well as single user licenses. Freeware 
is copyrighted software that is available free of charge. 
 is also available free of charge, but is 
limited in some way until you pay for it. 
 
is also distributed free of charge but uses the honor system 
to collect payment. Open 
 software may 
be sold or distributed free of charge, but the distribution must 
include the source code.

Section C: Software is available in several paradigms 
that affect how it is installed and used. 
 
apps run in a browser and require no installation. Mobile apps 
are designed for smartphones and tablets. They are typically 
downloaded and 
 from an app store or 
Web sites, though 
 owners’ devices must 
 the device to obtain apps from third-
party sources. Local applications for PCs are installed using 
a(n) 
 program that copies files, checks 
resources, and updates the Windows 
 . 
Software for Macs is distributed as 
 
packages that are dragged to the Applications folder to 
complete the installation. PC software that can be car-
ried on a USB flash drive and used without installation is 
called 
 software. To remove software 
that has been installed on a PC, Windows supplies a(n) 
 utility. 
SECTION D: Office suites are sometimes referred to as 
 software because they offer features 
that really help get work done. Word 
 
software assists you with composing, editing, designing, print-
ing, and ­electronically publishing documents. When you 
want to change margins, headers, and footers, you can use 
 layout tools. To change the spacing 
between lines or the alignment of text, you can use tools to 
adjust 
 style. 
 soft-
ware is like a smart piece of paper that automatically adds up 
the columns of numbers you write on it. You can use it to make 
other calculations, too, based on simple equations that you 
write or more complex, built-in formulas. Because it is so easy 
to experiment with different numbers, this type of software 
is particularly useful for 
 analyses. 
 software helps you store, find, organize, 
update, and report information located in one or more tables. 
Data is stored in 
 , which form records. 
When two sets of records are 
 , database 
software allows you to access data from both tables at the 
same time. 
 software supplies tools for 
creating a series of electronic slides that can be shown on a 
computer screen or projector.
SECTION E:  Every file has a name and might also 
have a file extension. The rules that specify valid file names 
are called file-naming 
 . These 
rules typically do not allow you to use certain characters or 
 words in a file name. A file’s 
location is defined by a file 
 , which 
includes the storage device, folder(s), file name, and exten-
sion. In Windows, storage devices are identified by a drive let-
ter, followed by a(n) 
 . Every storage device 
has a(n) 
 containing a list of files stored on 
the device. The top-level list of a device is referred to as the 
 directory, which can be subdivided into 
several smaller lists called subdirectories that are depicted as 
 . Windows File Explorer and the OS X 
 are examples of file management utili-
ties provided by operating systems. These utilities allow you 
to find, rename, copy, move, and delete files and folders. In 
addition, they allow you to perform file management activities 
with more than one file at a time. The way that data is actu-
ally stored is referred to as the 
 storage 
model. Before a computer stores data on a disk, CD, or DVD, 
it creates the equivalent of electronic storage bins by divid-
ing the disk into 
 and then further divid-
ing the disk into 
 . This dividing process 
is referred to as 
 . Each sector of a disk 
is numbered, providing a storage address that the operating 
system can track. Many computers work with a group of sec-
tors, called a(n) 
 , to increase the effi-
ciency of file storage operations. An operating system uses a file 
 to track the physical location of files.

Interactive Situation Questions
1.	
Your friend gave you a flash drive containing photos 
from a weekend event. After you copy the files, you 
notice a bunch of .DS files in addition to labeled photos. 
These files can be deleted because they are simply 
 files from a Mac. 
2.	
Every time you want to edit a photo, your PC pulls up 
a Viewer application that has no editing capabilities. To 
avoid this frustration in the future, you have to change 
the 
 application that is associated 
with the JPEG and PNG file extensions.
3.	
Your friend has an iPod Touch that’s loaded with all 
kinds of applications. But every time there’s a software 
update, your friend grumbles about “redoing stuff.” You 
guess that your friend’s iPod is 
 .
4.	
Suppose that you’ve been hired to organize a 
professional skateboard competition. When you 
consider how you’ll need to use digital devices, you 
realize that you must collect information on each 
competitor and keep track of every competitive event. 
With at least two types of related records, you’ll 
probably need to use 
 software.
5.	
The screen below is likely to appear during the process 
of 
 a software application.
6.	
While using several Windows programs at the same 
time, your computer displays an error message that 
refers to a program that is not responding. You recognize 
this message as one that might result from a(n) 
 leak and decide to close the non-
responding program using Task Manager.
7.	
Your friend wants to open a window on his Mac 
computer in which he can run Microsoft Windows and 
play some games designed for the Windows platform. 
You tell your friend to create a(n) 
 
machine using software such as Parallels Desktop.
8.	
Can you use a Windows application, create a 
document, and store it using the file name I L*ve NY? 
Yes or no? 
 
9.	
When specifying a location for a data file on 
your hard disk, you should avoid saving it in the 
 directory.
10.	 You have an old computer that you will donate to a school, 
but you want to make sure its hard disk contains no trace 
of your data. To do so, you use file 
 
software that overwrites empty sectors with random 1s and 
0s.

LAB: Put Your File Ducks in a Row
SOME DAY YOU HAVE TO GET ORGANIZED. That day is here. This lab is designed to help you evaluate your cur-
rent file organization and make improvements that will increase your productivity and reduce the frustration of rifling 
through a jumble of unorganized files and folders.
REQUIREMENTS: 
For this lab, you’ll need a desktop or laptop computer running Windows or OS X. The instructions are generalized; they 
provide helpful guidelines but not specific steps. You may have to do some exploring to find all the tools needed to com-
plete the assignment, but that is all part of the learning experience. 
ASSIGNMENT:
 Examine your desktop computer, laptop, or cloud 
drive and total up your organizational points as described 
below: 
Count the icons on your desktop. If you have fewer than 
20, award yourself 1 point. 
Check the root directory (Macintosh HD or Windows C:). 
Award yourself 1 point if there are only folders and no 
files there.
Examine the folders listed under your user name. Give 
yourself 1 point if you can identify the kinds of files that 
each one contains.
Open each of the folders listed under your user name. 
Award yourself 1 point if none of the folders is empty.
Open the Documents folder. Award yourself 1 point if you 
have fewer than 100 files (not counting folders) listed 
there.
If you use one set of folders for your personal data and 
another set of folders for school or work data, award 
yourself 1 point.
Open the folder that contains most of your photos. Give 
yourself 1 point if the photos are organized into subfold-
ers according to date, subject, or other criteria.
Browse files on your storage device. If you don’t seem to 
have unnecessary duplicates, give yourself 1 point.
If you can launch any program in fewer than 5 seconds, 
award yourself 1 point.
If files and folders that you use frequently are in your 
Favorites list, add another point to your score.
 Evaluate your score.
8–10 points: You’re organized!
5–7 points: You’re on the right track.
0–4 points: It is not too late to get organized.
 Make a backup of your data files. Do it.
If you have a backup, make sure it is current. If you have 
no backup, at least copy your data files to a USB flash 
drive.
 Switch to Details view (PC) or List view (Macs).
For organizing files, the Details and List views provide 
the best visual picture of the folder hierarchy. After your 
files are in order, you may want to use a different view for 
everyday file access. 
Use the View menu to experiment with various views. 
You may also explore the Sort options to see how they 
affect the arrangement of folders and files.
When you are finished exploring, return to the List view.
On a PC, select View and then select Details. Also use 
the Sort by option to select Type and Ascending, which 
lists all of the subfolders, followed by files.
On a Mac, select the List view and sort by Kind, which 
groups all of the subfolders together. Don’t worry if the 
subfolders are not at the top of the list.

 Organize your Favorites list. 
On both PCs and Macs, the Favorites list is a handy location for the folders that you use most frequently. It is the recom-
mended location for the preconfigured personal folders, such as Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and Downloads. You 
may also temporarily place there subfolders holding files for projects that you are currently working on. 
If the Favorites folder already contains the preconfigured personal folders, skip this step. If the Favorites folder does not list 
your preconfigured personal folders, locate them and drag them to the Favorites list.
On a Mac, you’ll find the preconfigured personal folders listed under Macintosh HD/Users/YourUserName. On a PC, you’ll 
find these folders listed under Windows (C:)\Users\YourUserName. 
 Add project subfolders to the Favorites list. 
Folders in the Favorites area can be accessed with a single click. Consider the projects that you are currently working on 
and the folders that you access most frequently. Are there any additional folders that you would like to add to the Favorites 
list?
Drag additional folders to the Favorites list as necessary.
TIP: Don’t let the Favorites list get too long or it will no longer be a quick way to access folders. When the number of folders 
in the Favorites list exceeds 20, it is time to remove folders that are less frequently used. To remove a folder, right-click  it 
and select the Remove option. Do not select the Delete option unless you want to move the folder and its contents to the 
trash.
 Clean up your desktop.
The desktop should be reserved for files that you access on a daily basis. For example, the desktop is a good place for a 
To-Do list. You may also store frequently used programs there, though the Start menu and taskbar are preferable locations 
because they are always visible. 
Remove any icons that are cluttering up your desktop. 
Drag the precon-
figured personal 
folders to the 
Favorites list.

 Deal with shortcuts.
A shortcut (PC) or alias (Mac) is a link to a file, folder, or application. Shortcuts and aliases are useful for items that you 
want to access from multiple places but don’t want to exist as actual copies. For example, if you use the same photo 
for two projects, you might not want to duplicate the photo, but you might want a link for the photo to exist in more than 
one folder.
As another example, you might want to be able to launch an application from the desktop as well as from the taskbar or 
dock. You don’t want two copies of the application, but a shortcut or alias will provide an icon that you can use.
Deleting a shortcut or alias only deletes the shortcut icon, not the file, folder, or application that it represents. You can 
identify shortcuts because their icons include an arrow. 
Check your desktop and file listings for shortcuts or aliases by looking for icons, folders, and files that display arrows. If 
you do not need the shortcuts, remove them by right-clicking and selecting the Delete option (PC) or the Move to Trash 
option (Mac).
 Organize your Documents folder.
A well-organized set of folders has a clear and logical hierarchical structure. For example, in the Documents folder, 
there can be subfolders for various types of documents. These folders can reflect various projects, assignments, 
classes, or jobs. The arrangement should reflect your work patterns.
To organize the files and subfolders in your Documents folder, do the following: 
• Make sure that subfolders are clearly named. Rename folders if necessary.
• For folders that contain an excessive number of files, create additional subfolders and move files into them.
• Delete unneeded folders and files.
Take a screenshot showing the subfolders in your newly organized Documents folder.
On a PC, press the PrtSc key to capture the screen in memory. Next, launch the Paint program. When Paint is open, 
hold down the Ctrl key and press the V key to paste the image into Paint. Save the image using the File menu.
On a Mac, press Command-Shift-3 to capture the screen image on the desktop. Locate the image on the desktop, 
rename the image, and move it to an appropriate folder.
The Chrome shortcut on the desk-
top can be identified by its arrow. It 
can be removed from the desktop 
because it is also on the toolbar.
The blue Classes folder on the desk-
top is an alias for the actual folder. 
Deleting the alias does not delete 
the actual folder or its contents.

Encryption
Encryption was once the domain of international spies and covert opera-
tions. Today it is used on a daily basis by anyone with a digital device. 
Some encryption takes place automatically, but consumers can add levels 
of encryption to increase the security of their digital devices and data. 
	How does encryption work? Encryption transforms a message or 
data file in such a way that its contents are hidden from unauthorized read-
ers. An original message or file that has not yet been encrypted is referred 
to as plaintext or cleartext. An encrypted message or file is referred to as 
ciphertext. The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext is called 
encryption. The reverse process—converting ciphertext into plaintext—is 
called decryption. 
Data is encrypted by using a cryptographic algorithm and a key. A 
cryptographic algorithm is a procedure for encryption or decryption. 
A cryptographic key (usually just called a key) is a word, number, or 
phrase that must be known to encrypt or decrypt data. 
	What can be encrypted? Encryption is commonly applied to data 
packets sent over wired or wireless networks, bank card numbers and 
other personal data sent to ecommerce sites, email messages that con-
tain confidential information, entire storage volumes for a digital device, and 
individual files that contain sensitive information.
	How well does encryption protect files? There are vari-
ous encryption methods, and some are more secure than others. AES 
(Advanced Encryption Standard) is the encryption standard currently 
used worldwide. It is possible to crack AES, but the process is difficult and 
requires lots of computer power. 
	How can I encrypt files? Methods for encrypting storage volumes 
are described later in this section. Individual files can be easily encrypted 
using encryption features built into applications such as word processing, 
spreadsheet, and database software. Encryption options, if available, can 
usually be found on the FILE menu. Figure 7-1 illustrates how to encrypt a 
file using Microsoft Word.
Figure 7-1: How to Encrypt individual Files with Microsoft Word
Use Microsoft Word or 
Apple iWork Pages to open a 
document. Find the encryption 
option on the application’s 
menu and encrypt the 
document. Close the document, 
and then make sure that you 
can open it.
Try It!
After creating a document 
in Microsoft Word, select 
the FILE tab, then use the 
Protect Document option.

SECTION A, Unit 7
Authentication
Authentication protocols, such as passwords, PINs, and fingerprint scan-
ners, are the first line of defense against data thieves and snoopers. A login 
password can protect data on lost or stolen devices. Passwords used as 
encryption keys help to make hijacked data unusable. The single most 
effective security measure for digital devices is to password protect access 
to them. Activating password protection is easy. 
	What are the password options for iOS devices? iPhones and 
iPads should be configured to require a login password, called a passcode, 
each time the device is used. When these devices are password protected, 
the entire contents of the storage volume are automatically encrypted. A 
hacker who manages to gain possession of a device must either guess the 
login password or break the encryption, which is possible, but not easy.
The standard iOS security setting establishes a four-digit numeric passcode, 
similar to a PIN (personal identification number). Short passcodes are not 
very secure. With four digits, only 10,000 passcodes are possible. Password 
hacking utilities can quickly try all of them in a matter of seconds. Also, on 
touch devices, fingerprint smudges may reveal the numbers for a passcode 
and make guessing it much easier. 
Long passcodes are more difficult to hack than four-digit PINs. To configure 
a longer passcode for an iOS device, use the Settings icon and select the 
option for Touch ID & Passcode (iPhone 5s) or the Passcode option as 
shown in Figure 7-2. 
When the Passcode setting looks like 
this, a passcode is required and the 
data on the device is encrypted.
Turn off the Simple Passcode option 
if you want a stronger passcode. For 
convenience, use an 8- to 14-digit 
number. For full-strength security, use 
letters, numbers, and symbols.
For maximum security, change these 
settings to off.
Hackers keep trying passwords until 
they find the one that works. You can 
put an end to the guessing game with 
this setting. After ten failed login 
attempts, the device will erase all the 
data it contains.
QuickCheck
Why are passcodes generally 
more secure than PINs?
a.	 Passcodes are longer.
b.	 Passcodes are more difficult 
for hackers to guess.
c.	 Passcodes contain letters as 
well as numbers.
d.	 All of the above
Figure 7-2: Login Password Management on iOS Devices
If you have an iPhone, look 
at the password settings and 
consider whether you would like 
to secure your device with more 
than a simple passcode.

	What are the password options for Android devices? Android 
devices have an overwhelming number of security settings. It is worthwhile 
to spend some time getting acquainted with them. Unlike iOS devices, 
Android devices do not automatically encrypt data stored on the device when 
a user activates the login password. Configuring a password and activating 
encryption are two separate steps as shown in Figure 7-3.
Figure 7-3: Login Password management on Android Devices
 Android password options are 
accessed from the Settings 
menu by selecting the Lock 
Screen option and then select-
ing Screen lock. Unlocking 
an Android device is possible 
using a numeric PIN, facial 
recognition, voice recognition, 
an alpha-numeric password, 
or a screen drawing. A strong 
password provides the best 
security. 
 To encrypt the files on an 
Android device, use the 
Security setting and select 
Encrypt device. When first acti-
vated, the encryption process 
may require an hour. Make sure 
your device is fully charged and 
plugged in during the process.

What is the advantage of 
having one setting to activate a 
password and another setting to 
activate encryption?
a.	 There can be separate 
passwords for login and 
encryption so that a hacker 
who discovers a login 
password can’t access 
unencrypted data.
b.	 Passwords are shorter than 
encryption strings, so they 
are easier to remember.
c.	 There is no advantage to 
having separate settings, and 
because of this, iOS handles 
security better than Android 
OS.

	What are the password options for Windows? Windows offers 
several password options that can be configured using the Accounts utility, 
which is accessed from the Start menu or Control Panel. Figure 7-4 explains 
the options and points out the critical security settings. 
	Is it possible to encrypt a Windows hard drive volume? 
Windows devices can be encrypted using Microsoft’s BitLocker or third-
party utilities. BitLocker is supplied with the Pro edition of Windows 7, 8, and 
10, but not with the basic editions. Options to encrypt drive volumes are also 
available in the Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows. 
For Windows users who are working with the basic edition, individual 
file encryption can be used for critical files, as explained earlier in this 
unit. Software utilities that offer more comprehensive volume encryption 
capabilities include Symantec Encryption and GNU Privacy Guard.
 Use this option to change the password or disable the login password. 
Disabling the password is not recommended because it allows anyone to 
access files on the device.
 Designate a photo and a sequence of actions to carry out as a login 
sequence. For example, the photo might be of your dog, and the 
sequence might be to touch or click its nose and then its tail.
 Use a four-digit PIN instead of a password. This option is supplied pri-
marily for tablet users who find it cumbersome to enter a long password 
containing letters, numbers, and symbols. Secure devices should have 
the PIN login option disabled.
 Users typically leave their digital devices in sleep mode rather than shut-
ting them down, so devices that are lost or stolen are likely to be in sleep 
mode. Configuring a device to require a password when waking from sleep 
adds an important layer of security. Be sure this feature is activated.

Strong Passwords
A strong password is difficult to hack. Conventional wisdom tells us that 
strong passwords are at least eight characters in length and include one or 
more uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. These conventions create 
passwords that may be fairly difficult to crack, but they are also impossible 
to remember. What to do? 
	How can hackers get my password? Hackers and identity thieves 
employ a whole range of ways to steal passwords. In public places, a hacker 
might simply look over your shoulder as you type in your password. Identity 
thieves can easily find your password if you write it down on a yellow sticky 
note hidden under your keyboard or displayed in plain sight on the back of 
your phone. 
If a hacker doesn’t have physical access to your device but it is connected to 
a network, your password can be discovered using a remote computer and 
software tools that systematically guess your password, intercept it, or trick 
you into revealing it. 
A brute force attack uses password-cracking software to generate every 
possible combination of letters, numerals, and symbols. Because it exhausts 
all possible combinations to discover a password, a brute force attack can 
run for days before a password is cracked.
A dictionary attack helps hackers guess your password by stepping 
through a dictionary containing word lists in common languages such as 
English, Spanish, French, and German. These dictionaries also include 
common mutations of words, such as p@ssw0rd, and hundreds of fre-
quently used passwords, such as qwerty. Dictionary attacks are effective 
because many users choose passwords that are easy to remember and 
likely to be in the most commonly used list (Figure 7-6).

	What makes a password susceptible to a dictionary attack? 
Many of the clever schemes users devise to create passwords are obvi-
ous to hackers and the programmers who create password-cracking tools. 
Weak passwords include the following:
• Words from a dictionary, including words that are in languages other than 
English
• Doubled words such as passpass or computercomputer
• Default passwords such as password, admin, system, and guest
• Words with a sequence of numbers at the end, such as Missy123 and 
Dolphins2016
• Words with symbol or numeric mutations, such as p@ssw0rd and V01dem0rt
• Sequences of numbers formatted as dates or telephone numbers, such as 
01/01/2000 and 888-5566
• Any sequence that includes a user name, such as BillMurray12345
• Any sequence that uses conventional capitalization, such as Book34 and 
Savannah912
	What makes a password susceptible to a brute force attack? 
Brute force attacks methodically try every possible password until the 
correct one is found. Consider a simple guess-the-number game. You 
have a much better chance of guessing a number between 1 and 10 than 
guessing the correct number between 1 and 10,000. In the same way, a 
password selected from a universe of 10,000 possibilities is easier to crack 
than a password selected from a universe of 100 million possibilities.
The number of possible passwords depends on factors that include the size 
of the character set and the length of the password. Longer passwords and 
those consisting of letters, numbers, and symbols are more difficult to crack. 
The general formula for calculating the number of possible passwords is:
NumberOfCharacters ^PasswordLength
For example, suppose you are creating a simple password for an iPhone. 
The character set consists of ten numerals on the keypad: 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. 
The password length is four digits. The number of possible passwords is:
104
NumberOfCharacters            PasswordLength
104 is 10 x 10 x 10 x 10, which is equal to 10,000. Password-cracking 
software, with its ability to try more than a billion passwords per second, can 
run through all those possibilities in the blink of an eye.
How much safer is a five-digit password? The number of possibilities is 105, 
which is 100,000. That’s a big increase over the possibilities for a four-digit 
password, but those possibilities are still easily handled by password-
cracking software.
An eight-character password using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, 
numerals, and symbols has 6,095,689,385,410,816 possibilities. Running 
through all those possibilities would take more than a week. The difficulty of 
cracking such a password is a good start in providing enough entropy for a 
secure password.

SECTION A, Unit 7
	What is password entropy? The number of possible passwords 
quickly becomes very large. Rather than discuss such huge numbers, 
security experts express password strength in terms of entropy. Password 
entropy is a measure in bits of a password’s unpredictability. For example, 
the entropy of a four-digit iPhone passcode is 14 bits. For those of you 
interested in the math, entropy is calculated like this:
log2 104 
104 = 10,000. log2 of 10,000 = 13.2877
Notice that the number of bits does not refer to the length of the password. 
An iPhone’s passcode is four digits in length, but its entropy is rounded up 
to 14. The number 14 enumerates how many bits are needed to represent 
the number of possible passcodes in binary. For the iPhone, the number of 
possible passwords is 10,000. That’s 10011100010000 in binary. Count the 
number of bits. There are 14, and that is the entropy (Figure 7-7).
	Is all that math important? All that math illustrates the principles that 
underlie secure passwords. The takeaway about entropy is that passwords 
with higher entropy are more secure than passwords with low entropy. A 
46-bit password, therefore, is far more secure than a 13-bit password.
Also, entropy is a theoretical concept. In the real world, security measures 
may be in place to prevent hacking tools from trying a continuous stream 
of passwords. Login routines at Web sites often restrict the speed at which 
passwords can be entered and the number of consecutive passwords 
that can be tried before the account is temporarily frozen and alternative 
authentication is required. Adjusting device settings to limit the number of 
login attempts is a wise security step.

	What is the recommended method for creating secure 
passwords? The sophistication of password-cracking software and the 
processor speeds of today’s computers pose challenges for consumers. 
Long, random passwords are most secure, but they are difficult to 
remember. It is possible to devise and remember a secure password for 
one or two sites, but the average consumer may have passwords for more 
than 50 devices and Web sites. Devising 50 unique, strong passwords 
and remembering which passwords correspond to which sites is just about 
impossible, or is it? Figure 7-8 offers some advice for creating passwords.
Figure 7-8: Password advice
Start with a phrase. Base your high-security password on the first 
letters of a phrase that generates a password containing numbers and 
proper nouns. 
• Aim for a length of 8 to 12 characters because some sites limit 
password length. 
• Use uppercase letters somewhere other than at the beginning of 
the password.
• Use numbers somewhere other than at the end of the password.
• Some sites do not allow symbols, so you may not want to use them 
in a password that will be modified for use on many sites.
Here is an example of a phrase that produces a fairly secure password:
I went to Detroit Michigan when I was 23 years old
IwtDMwiw23yo
Add the site name. By inserting the name of the site, every password 
will be unique and you will be able to remember the site on which it is 
used, like this:
I went to PayPal when I was 23 years old
IwtPayPalwiw23yo
Make a low-security password. A password achieves pretty good 
entropy when it is composed of four or more words. Create an everyday 
password using this method. Here is an example:
SpaBraidAmazonNuit
Be careful what you write. If you have to write down your passwords 
to remember them, keep them in a safe place that is not connected to 
your digital device. If your device is stolen, the passwords should not be 
located where they would also be stolen. 
Use encryption. If you want to store passwords on your device, make 
sure to encrypt the file in which they are stored.
Use a password manager. If you feel more secure with a totally 
random and unique password for each of your logins, then a password 
manager is an excellent option.
Try It!
Using the guidelines in Figure 
7-8, create a secure multi-use 
password.

Password Managers
You hated memorizing facts in elementary school, and memorizing pass-
words is even less fun. Digital tools for managing passwords promise to 
shoulder the burden, but nothing is perfect, and password managers are not 
hacker-proof.
	How does a password manager work? The core function of a 
password manager (sometimes called a keychain) is to store user IDs with 
their corresponding passwords. Some password managers also have the 
ability to fill in forms with stored address and credit card data. Password 
managers are available as operating system utilities, browser extensions, 
and standalone utilities.
Password managers can generate unique passwords composed of random 
letters, numbers, and symbols. These passwords have very good entropy 
and do not have to be memorized because they are stored and automatically 
retrieved by the password manager as needed.
Password managers may also include a strength meter that indicates 
password security—a feature that is useful if you create a custom password 
rather than using one generated by the password manager (Figure 7-9).
Figure 7-9: Password Managers Can Generate Strong Passwords
	Who has access to the passwords? Password managers store 
passwords in an encrypted file, which is accessed by a master password. 
Consumers have to remember only the master password. Passwords for 
individual sites are handled by the password manager.
The password file may also contain form data including credit card num-
bers. The data stored by a password manager is secure unless the master 
password is cracked. In that unfortunate situation, all of the passwords and 
financial data in the file are compromised and can be used by a hacker. In 
addition, if you forget the master password, then you are locked out of all 
your password-protected accounts. 
A password meter indicates the strength 
of a password and its resistance to 
brute force and dictionary attacks.

	Is the data stored by a password manager secure? The vulner-
ability of a file protected by a single master password is the security tradeoff 
for the convenience of delegating password security to password man-
agement software. The security of passwords created and preserved by a 
password manager also depends on where the password file is stored.
Local Storage. Passwords stored locally are tied to the device on which 
they are created. When a password manager is installed on a laptop, for 
example, the passwords are available only when using that device. The 
password file is encrypted, but if the device is stolen, hackers can take their 
time trying to crack the master password.
Passwords stored locally are not available when using other devices. For 
example, if you usually work with the Safari browser on your MacBook Air, 
it stores your passwords; but if you use a public computer in a coffee shop, 
your passwords are not accessible from that machine. This disadvantage 
of local storage encourages many consumers to try cloud-based password 
managers.
Cloud Storage. Some password managers can store the encrypted pass-
word file in the cloud. That file can be accessed from any device as long 
as the master password is provided. Storing a file full of passwords in the 
cloud can be a security risk, however. Web-based password managers can 
be attractive targets for password thieves. By breaking into a single site, 
a password thief could harvest millions of passwords. When considering 
cloud-based password management tools, evaluate them carefully before 
trusting them with your valuable login data.
USB Storage. There are a few password managers available as portable 
apps, which can be carried on a USB drive. These apps store your pass-
words in an encrypted file on a USB drive. The passwords are available on 
any device with a USB port. For extra protection against intruders who might 
search your device for passwords, a flash drive that contains a password 
manager can be unplugged when you are not accessing password-protected 
sites. You can also remove the flash drive from your device when you’re out 
so that your nosy roommate can’t snoop through your digital files. When you 
remove the USB drive, your portable password manager leaves behind no 
traces of passwords. Losing the USB drive puts your digital life at risk, how-
ever, so consider connecting it to your key ring.

Malware Threats
Exploits against digital devices began as harmless stunts but quickly turned 
nasty. Simple pranks evolved into attacks that wiped out data on hard drives, 
wormed into networks, pilfered massive numbers of personal records, and 
hijacked access to segments of the Web. Malware is also a component of 
cyberwarfare attacks that pose a threat to national security. 
	What are malware threats? Malware refers to any computer 
program designed to surreptitiously enter a digital device. Malware can be 
classified by the way in which it enters a device or by the type of activity it 
carries out. Common classifications of malware include viruses, worms, and 
trojans. 
Malware is created and unleashed by individuals referred to as hackers, 
crackers, black hats, or cybercriminals. Some malware is released as a 
prank. Other malware is designed to distribute political messages or disrupt 
operations at specific companies. In an increasing number of cases, mal-
ware is exploited for monetary gain. Malware designed for identity theft or 
extortion has become a very real threat to individuals and corporations. 
Once malware infiltrates a device, its behavior depends on how it is pro-
grammed. The action carried out by malware code is referred to as a 
payload. Malware can be used for many types of payloads, such as deleting 
files, recording login keystrokes, opening access for intruders, and allowing 
remote control of a device. Figure 7-10 lists some malware payloads that

computer Viruses
The first computer virus designed to affect personal computers appeared in 
1982 when the Apple II was at the height of its popularity. This virus, called 
Elk Cloner, was relatively harmless. It blanked the screen and displayed a 
short poem. From such innocent beginnings, viruses developed into a major 
threat, launching nasty attacks such as wiping out all the data stored on 
hard disks and overwriting the BIOS to make a computer unbootable.
	What is a virus? A computer virus is a set of self-replicating program 
instructions that surreptitiously attaches itself to a legitimate executable file 
on a host device. When the infected file is run, the virus code is loaded into 
RAM with the rest of the program. Once in RAM, the virus code is executed. 
When executed, the virus can replicate itself by injecting malicious code into 
other files. A common misconception is that viruses spread themselves from 
one device to another; they don’t. Viruses can only replicate themselves on 
the host device. 
In addition to replicating itself, a virus usually delivers a payload, which can 
be as harmless as displaying an annoying message or as devastating as 
trashing the data on your computer’s storage device. It can corrupt files, 
destroy data, or otherwise disrupt operations. A trigger event, such as a 
specific date, can unleash some viruses. Viruses that deliver their payloads 
on a specific date are sometimes referred to as time bombs. Viruses that 
deliver their payloads in response to some other system event are referred 
to as logic bombs.
Today, viruses are a mild threat. They do not spread rapidly, and they are 
easily filtered out by antivirus software. They are interesting, however, 
because they illustrate the beginning of black hat culture and reveal the 
basic techniques that are still used to inject third-party code into legitimate 
data streams. Code injection is the process of modifying an executable file 
or data stream by adding additional commands, as shown in Figure 7-11.

Code for a virus or other malware can 
be injected into a legitimate file. When 
that file is executed, the virus code is 
executed, too.
Malicious code can also be injected 
into a data stream as it travels from 
one device to another. After the 
altered data arrives, it is typically 
stored and eventually executed.

	How does a virus spread? Viruses spread when people exchange 
infected files on disks and CDs, as email attachments, and on file sharing 
networks, social networking sites, and download sites. They can also be 
inadvertently obtained from unauthorized app stores. Through a process 
called side-loading, an app from a source other than an official app store is 
installed on a device. Often these apps are altered versions of popular apps, 
which are placed on unofficial download sites. The app appears to be the 
same as the original legitimate app, but when downloaded it may install a 
virus or other malware.
A key characteristic of viruses is their ability to lurk in a device for days or 
months, quietly replicating themselves. While this replication takes place, 
you might not even know that your device has contracted a virus; therefore, 
it is possible to inadvertently spread infected files to other people’s devices. 
Although viruses are no longer a top malware threat, virus-cloaking technol-
ogy has become very sophisticated and is a key element of today’s most 
serious security exploits. Viruses and other malware can cloak themselves 
using various techniques, such as rootkits. 
	What is a rootkit? Any code that is designed to hide the existence of 
processes and privileges is referred to as a rootkit. Rootkits were originally 
designed to allow “root” or administrative access to digital devices and com-
puter systems. By changing system settings and then hiding those changes, 
hackers were able to become shadow administrators with access to all data 
on a device or network.
Modern rootkits are used to hide malicious code by replacing parts of the 
operating system with modified code. For example, a rootkit might subvert 
the operating system’s master file table to hide evidence of the sectors in 
which a virus is stored. Some rootkits are even able to disable antivirus soft-
ware to prevent it from detecting the existence of malware (Figure 7-12).

SECTION B, Unit 7
computer worms
Initially, the spread of malware from computer to computer depended on 
humans to exchange infected floppy disks. In 1996, the distribution vec-
tor began to change as hackers devised malware that could spread on its 
own from one device to another. The first self-distributing malware infiltrated 
email address books to essentially mail copies of its code to other devices. 
By 2000, hackers were able to create malware that sent itself to huge num-
bers of IP addresses.
	What is a worm? A computer worm is a self-replicating, self-distribut-
ing program designed to carry out unauthorized activity on a victim’s device. 
Worms are usually standalone executable programs that can spread them-
selves from one device to another without any assistance from victims. 
Worms can enter a device through security holes in browsers and operating 
systems, as email attachments, and when victims click infected pop-up ads 
or links contained in email messages. There are several common types of 
computer worms.
A mass-mailing worm spreads by sending itself to every address in the 
address book of an infected device. If a mass-mailing worm infects your 
device, for example, your friends receive infected messages sent from your 
mail account. Thinking that the message is from a trusted source, your 
friends are likely to open the infected attachment, spreading the worm to 
their devices and then passing it on to their friends. 
An Internet worm looks for vulnerabilities in operating systems, open com-
munications ports, and JavaScripts on Web pages. These worms travel 
over communications networks as small bootstrap files that infiltrate digital 
devices. When a worm finds a host, it connects to a remote computer to 
download more comprehensive malware. 
A file-sharing worm copies itself into a shared folder under an innocuous 
name. When the folder is distributed over a file sharing network or BitTorrent, 
the worm tags along and spreads to all the devices that participate in the 
share. Figure 7-12 illustrates how computer worms spread.

Trojans
Stuxnet is a notorious computer worm that damaged devices used in Iran’s 
nuclear program. It is often identified as one of the first cyberwarfare tools. 
A file called Stuxnet.exe is unlikely to be downloaded, so malware devel-
opers depend on trojans to disguise malware as innocuous utility software 
and popular applications. Today, more than 80% of malware infections are 
trojans.
	How do trojans differ from viruses and worms? A trojan (some-
times called a “Trojan Horse”) is a computer program that seems to perform 
one function while actually doing something else. Unlike a worm, a trojan is 
not designed to spread itself to other devices. Also differing from viruses and 
worms, most trojans are not designed to replicate themselves. 
Trojans are standalone programs that masquerade as useful utilities or 
applications, which victims download and install unaware of their destructive 
nature. Trojans depend on social engineering—fooling users—to spread. 
Social engineering exploits are covered in detail in a later section of this unit.
Trojans can contain viruses, code to take control of a device, or routines 
called droppers.
	What is a dropper? A dropper is designed to deliver or “drop” mali-
cious code into a device. It is similar to a setup program that unzips and 
installs software applications on Windows devices except that droppers 
secretly install malware rather than legitimate software.
Droppers are commonly the first phase of a sophisticated malware attack. 
Most droppers contain compressed or encrypted malware files. When 
delivered, these files are uncompressed in memory to avoid detection. The 
uncompressed files are executed, sometimes to carry out a payload or to 
collect and install other malware components. Stuxnet famously used a 
dropper to initiate its attack (Figure 7-14).
Figure 7-14: Stuxnet ATTACKS Nuclear Centrifuges

In the context of malware, a 
trojan’s main purpose is to 
____________.
a.	 disguise malware as

b.	 replicate on a host machine
c.	 spread as quickly as possible
d.	 load additional malicious 
code
 A USB drive containing the 
Stuxnet dropper is inserted into a 
computer.
 A security hole in Windows runs 
the dropper when the USB directory is 
viewed.
 The dropper executes a sec-
ond file containing a worm.
 When the worm arrives at a tar-
get device, in this case a centrifuge, 
it downloads a more comprehensive 
file containing instructions for the 
payload.
 The worm spreads through the 
LAN, looking for a specific type of 
hardware device that Stuxnet is 
designed to destroy.
 The malware payload causes 
the nuclear centrifuges to fail.

SECTION B, Unit 7
Antivirus software
Any data entering a digital device could be malware. Users have little hope 
of identifying files that contain malicious code. Avoiding known sources of 
malware, such as free file sharing services and offshore download sites, 
may reduce the risk of encountering malware; however, malicious code 
exists at legitimate Web sites and infiltrates trusted networks. The best 
defense against malware is antivirus software.
	What are the most popular antivirus products? Antivirus soft-
ware is a type of utility software that looks for and eliminates viruses, trojans, 
worms, and other malware. It is available for all types of computers and data 
storage devices, including smartphones, tablets, personal computers, USB 
flash drives, servers, PCs, and Macs. Popular antivirus software includes 
Norton AntiVirus, Kaspersky Anti-Virus, F-Secure Anti-Virus, Windows 
Defender, and Avast.
	How does antivirus software work? Modern antivirus software 
runs as a background process and attempts to identify malware that exists 
on a device or is entering a device as a download, email message, attach-
ment, or Web page. The process of searching for malware is sometimes 
referred to as scanning or performing a virus scan. To identify malware, anti-
virus software can look for a virus signature or perform heuristic analyses.
	What is a virus signature? A virus signature is a section of program 
code that contains a unique series of instructions known to be part of a mal-
ware exploit. Although they are called virus signatures, the unique code may 
identify a virus, worm, trojan, or other malware exploit. 
Virus signatures are discovered by security experts who examine the bit 
sequences contained in malware program code (Figure 7-15). When dis-
covered, virus signatures are added to a collection of virus definitions, which 
form a database that is used by antivirus software as it works to scan files 
that may harbor malware.
	What is heuristic analysis? Antivirus software can use techniques 
called heuristic analysis to detect malware by analyzing the characteris-
tics and behavior of suspicious files. These techniques are especially useful 
for detecting new malware for which signatures have yet to be collected and 
added to the virus database. 
One method of heuristic analysis allows the suspicious file to run in a 
guarded environment called a sandbox. If the file exhibits malicious behav-
ior, it is treated like a virus and quarantined or deleted.
A second method of heuristic analysis involves inspecting the contents of 
a suspicious file for commands that carry out destructive or surveillance 
activities.

	How well does heuristic analysis work? Heuristic analysis 
requires time and system resources to examine files that arrive as down-
loads and email attachments. The process can slightly affect performance 
while the analysis is in progress. 
Heuristics may produce false positives that mistakenly identify a legitimate 
file as malware. For example, a legitimate disk utility that contains routines 
for enhancing disk drive performance by deleting redundant files might be 
mistaken for a virus and prevented from being installed. Such a situation 
could be perplexing for users who download software, only for it to disap-
pear upon arrival. Users who understand how antivirus software works 
should be able to quickly conclude that the legitimate application was mis-
takenly flagged as malware.
	What happens when malware is detected? When antivirus soft-
ware detects malware, it can try to remove the infection, put the file into 
quarantine, or simply delete the file (Figure 7-16). 
Repair. Antivirus software can sometimes remove the 
malware code from infected files. This strategy is benefi-
cial for files containing important documents that have 
become infected. Many of today’s malware exploits are 
embedded in executable files and are difficult to remove. 
When malware cannot be removed, the file should not be 
used.
Quarantine. In the context of antivirus software, a 
quarantined file contains code that is suspected of 
being part of a virus. For your protection, most antivirus 
software encrypts the file’s contents and isolates it in a 
quarantine folder so it can’t be inadvertently opened or 
accessed by a hacker. Quarantined files cannot be run, 
but they can be moved out of quarantine if they are later 
found to have been falsely identified as malware. 
Delete. Quarantined files should eventually be deleted. 
Most antivirus software allows users to specify how long 
an infected file should remain in quarantine before it is 
deleted. Most users rarely retrieve files from quarantine 
because it is risky to work with files that are suspected of 
harboring malicious code. There is no need, therefore, to 
delay deletion for more than a few days. 
Figure 7-16: Malware detected
QuickCheck
What is the purpose of putting 
malware into quarantine?
a.	 It prevents users from 
inadvertently running the 
malware.
b.	 It allows the file to be 
reinstated if it proves not to 
be malware.
c.	 It prevents hackers from 
using it in exploits.
d.	 All of the above

SECTION B, Unit 7
	How dependable is antivirus software? Today’s antivirus soft-
ware is quite dependable but not infallible. A fast-spreading worm can reach 
your digital device before a virus definition update arrives, and cloaking soft-
ware can hide some viral exploits. 
Despite occasional misses, however, antivirus software and other security 
software modules are constantly weeding out malware that would otherwise 
infect your device. It is essential to use security software, but it is also impor-
tant to take additional precautions, such as making regular backups of your 
data and avoiding untrustworthy software distribution outlets.
	How do I ensure that my antivirus software is running? 
Antivirus software is an aspect of our digital lives that we tend to take for 
granted. We assume that it is installed and carrying out its work. However, 
antivirus software can be inadvertently disabled. Its configuration can be 
changed by malware that manages to infiltrate a device. It can expire at the 
end of a trial period or subscription. Ensuring that antivirus software is per-
forming correctly may require periodic intervention from users. 
Many antivirus products display an icon in the taskbar or notification area. 
The icon may offer a visual clue to indicate when the antivirus utility is active, 
scanning, or updating. Glancing at the icon can assure you that the software 
is running properly.
Some targeted malware attacks may alter the icons, however, leading you 
to believe that the antivirus software is active when, in fact, it has been dis-
abled by a malware attack. As shown in Figure 7-17, opening the antivirus 
software periodically to view its status is a good practice.
Figure 7-17: AntiVirus Software is Actively Scanning

	What configuration options are available? Once you have 
installed antivirus software, the best and safest practice is to keep it run-
ning full time in the background so that it checks every email message as it 
arrives and scans all files that attempt to install themselves or run. For the 
most extensive protection from malware, you should look for and enable the 
following features of your antivirus software:
• Start scanning when the device boots.
• Scan all programs when they are launched, and scan document files when 
they are opened.
• Scan other types of files, such as graphics, if you engage in some risky 
computing behaviors and are not concerned with the extra time required to 
open files as they are scanned.
• Scan incoming email and attachments.
• Scan incoming instant message attachments.
• Scan outgoing email for worm activity such as mass-mailing worms.
• Scan zipped (compressed) files.
• Scan for spyware and PUAs (potentially unwanted applications).
• Scan all files on the device’s storage volume at least once a week.
	Where are the configuration settings? The location for configura-
tion settings depends on the antivirus software. Usually, there is a Settings 
menu or a Preferences option. It is important to examine the settings after 
installing new antivirus software and after getting updates to make sure the 
desired level of protection is in place. 
Also check for exclusions. If files, processes, and locations are excluded, 
they will not be scanned for malware. This feature is available to enhance 
performance from trusted sites, but it can be a doorway for malware 
exploits. For maximum protection, make sure that there are no exclusions 
listed in your antivirus software settings. Settings for Windows Defender are 
accessed from the Settings tab (Figure 7-18).
Figure 7-18: Be sure to eliminate all exclusions
This exclusion prevents the anti-
virus software from scanning 
downloads—not a good idea.

What is significant about 
exclusions in antivirus settings?
a.	 They are usually zero-
day attacks and won’t be 
detected.

SECTION B, Unit 7
	Do I need to take any action when a virus is detected? Most 
antivirus software displays an alert when malware is detected. Antivirus 
software automatically takes action to protect your device by attempting to 
repair the file, place it in quarantine, or delete it. 
You do not have to take any action. However, the alert message is an impor-
tant piece of information that may indicate you are connected to a malicious 
site or receiving email from an unreliable source that would be best avoided 
in the future (Figure 7-19). 
	What is the best way to handle updates? Two aspects of your 
antivirus software periodically need to be updated. First, the antivirus pro-
gram itself might need a patch or an update to fix bugs or improve features. 
Second, the list of virus signatures must be updated to keep up with the lat-
est malware developments. 
Antivirus program updates and revised virus definitions are packaged into 
a file that can be manually or automatically downloaded. Most antivirus 
products are preconfigured to regularly check for updates, download them, 
and install them without user intervention. If you would rather control the 
download and installation process yourself, you can configure your antivi-
rus software to alert you when updates are ready. In any case, you should 
manually check for updates periodically just in case the auto-update func-
tion has become disabled by malware or if your subscription has expired. 
	What is the purpose of a manual scan? A manual scan is initiated 
by a user for the purpose of scanning one or more files. Manual scans are 
useful if you suspect that a virus has slipped into a device despite security 
measures. For example, a previously unknown attack might arrive unde-
tected, but after an antivirus update, it can be detected by running a manual 
scan. 
Manually scanning all the files stored on a device can slow performance, so 
schedule the scan for a time when you are not usually using your device, 
but it is turned on.
You can also run a manual scan of a specific file. For example, suppose you 
download an application and you want to make sure it is virus-free before 
you install and run it. Depending on your antivirus software, you might be 
able to simply right-click the file name to start the scan. Otherwise, open 
your antivirus software and select the manual scan option.

	What’s a virus hoax? Some virus threats are very real, but you’re also 
likely to get email messages about so-called viruses that don’t really exist. 
A virus hoax usually arrives as an email message containing dire warn-
ings about a supposedly new virus on the loose. It typically provides a link 
to download some type of detection and protection software. It may include 
removal instructions that actually delete parts of the operating system. And, 
of course, you are encouraged to forward this “crucial” information to your 
friends.
When you receive an email message about a virus or any other type of 
malware, don’t panic. It could be a hoax. You can check one of the many 
hoaxbuster or antivirus software Web sites to determine whether you’ve 
received a hoax or information about a real threat. These Web sites also 
provide security or virus alerts, which list all of the most recent legitimate 
malware threats. If the virus is a real threat, the Web site can provide infor-
mation to help determine whether your device has been infected. You can 
also find instructions for eradicating the virus. If the virus threat is a hoax 
like the one in Figure 7-20, by no means should you forward the email mes-
sage to others.

Intrusion Threats
Unleashing viruses, worms, and trojans kept hackers busy for many years, 
and they gleefully watched their creations spread to devices throughout the 
world. But viruses and worms were ultimately unsatisfying because once an 
exploit was released, hackers had no way to interact with it or take control of 
infected devices. Inevitably, someone came up with the concept of malware 
that could connect back to a hacker’s command and control center.
	What is the risk of online intrusions? An online intrusion takes 
place when an unauthorized person gains access to a digital device by 
using an Internet connection and exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware or 
software. Across the globe, millions of devices have been surreptitiously 
infiltrated and can be controlled by hackers to send out massive quantities 
of spam, block access to targeted Web sites, or become part of a pornogra-
phy network. 
Every day, thousands of people discover that they are the victims of iden-
tity theft resulting from an intruder gaining access to their digital files. 
Thousands more realize that cameras on their devices are controlled by an 
unknown hacker. A growing number of devices are being remotely locked 
by extortionists who demand payment to supply an unlock code. All of these 
exploits are likely to have been carried out by online intrusions. 
An infiltrated device can be used as a launching platform for viruses and 
network-jamming attacks. Hackers have even found ways to turn thousands 
of infiltrated computers into remote-controlled “zombies,” link them together, 
and carry out coordinated attacks to disrupt online access to Microsoft, Bank 
of America, and other Internet businesses.
	What are the characteristics of online intrusions? Most online 
intrusions begin with malware. A worm or trojan infiltrates a device and sets 
up a backdoor that can be used for future access. That access can be used 
directly by a human to log in to the victim’s device over the Internet. It can be 
used as a gateway for additional malware to infect a device. It can also be 
used as a conduit for commands issued from a hacker to a group of infected 
devices (Figure 7-21).

SECTION C, Unit 7
	Are there different types of intrusions? Yes. RATs, remote 
utilities, ransomware, and botnets are the most common types of online 
intrusions.
	What is a RAT? A RAT (Remote Access Trojan) is malware that arrives 
in a trojan disguised as legitimate software and sets up a secret communi-
cation link to a hacker. RATs are the underlying technology for most online 
intrusions. 
	How do hackers take remote control of digital devices? A 
backdoor is an undocumented method of accessing a digital device. RATs 
create a backdoor to a victim’s device that can be used by a hacker to send 
commands that take control of the device’s camera, activate the micro-
phone, or launch screen captures. Images and audio acquired by hackers 
are commonly posted on social media sites and used to extort money from 
victims who do not want their private activities made public.
	Are legitimate remote access utilities a vulnerability? Features 
such as Windows Remote Desktop and OS X Screen Sharing are legitimate 
software utilities that allow users to access their computers from a remote 
location. These utilities are handy for travelers who want to read, modify, or 
copy files stored on a computer that was left at home or at work. Remote 
access utilities open a communication port—on Windows computers, it is 
TCP port 3389—that is ready to accept remote data and commands. 
In theory, remote commands are accepted only from someone who has 
logged in with valid credentials. However, a poorly configured remote access 
utility might not request a login password, or it may allow access through a 
standard guest account. 
To block unauthorized use of remote access utilities, they should be disabled 
during those times when they are not needed. Unless you are traveling and 
expect to access files on a computer that you’ve left at home, make sure 
Screen Sharing (Macs) or Remote Desktop (PCs) is turned off. Figure 7-22 
shows how to configure the Remote Desktop setting in Windows.

Figure 7-23: Ransomware Demands
	What is ransomware? Smartphones are the top target for ransom-
ware that locks a device and then requests payment for an unlocking code. 
This intrusion commonly exploits the Find My iPhone feature of iPhones, 
but variants of ransomware target Android, Windows, and OS X devices 
by encrypting all the data they contain. Victims who pay the ransom rarely 
obtain the decryption key. Once the scammers have their money, they may 
not bother to unlock the files. The FBI recommends that victims ignore the 
ransom demand, scrub the device, and restore files from a backup.
Ransomware is one of the fastest growing threats to digital devices. It 
has become a cultural meme featured in novels and on popular television 
series, such as The Good Wife. Most ransomware attacks are variants of 
an exploit called Cryptolocker. Hackers launch new strains of this exploit 
frequently. These new variants may not be blocked by antivirus software 
until the virus database is updated. Anti-exploit software that runs in addi-
tion to antivirus software may offer further defenses against ransomware.
Consumers can expect ransomware exploits of increasing sophistication. 
Attacks not only affect files on a device’s main storage volume, but can 
affect USB drives, external hard drives, and any other storage devices con-
nected at the time of the attack. To prepare for a possible ransomware 
exploit, be sure to maintain current backups of your important data and 
disconnect the backup device when backups are not in progress. Taking 
these steps will help ensure that you’ll be prepared if you ever encounter 
the ransomware screen in Figure 7-23.

SECTION C, Unit 7
	What is a botnet? Hackers who gain control over several computers 
can organize them into a client-server network known as a botnet. This net-
work is hidden from the victims, who continue to use their devices as usual 
and are unaware of botnet activities that may be taking place behind the 
scenes. 
A botnet has a server that is controlled by hackers. Victims’ computers 
become network nodes, which carry out a variety of activities as directed 
by the server. Small botnets contain a few hundred devices. However, the 
world’s largest botnets are estimated to contain more than 450,000 devices!
Botnets have been used to carry out massive DDoS (distributed denial of 
service) attacks designed to flood a legitimate Web site or Internet router 
with so much traffic that it can no longer provide its intended service. DDoS 
traffic is generated by hundreds or thousands of botnet nodes harnessed to 
do the bidding of a botmaster. 
DDoS attacks that target corporate sites are often associated with ransom 
demands. These attacks have also been used to disrupt business competi-
tors. Some DDoS attacks appear to be proof-of-concept exercises to test 
security measures of government agencies, financial institutions, and key 
infrastructure systems.
In addition to their role in DDoS attacks, botnets are commonly used to gen-
erate email spam, carry out click fraud, generate Bitcoin electronic cash, 
and crack encryption. Figure 7-24 provides more information about botnets.

Anti-Exploit Software
Consumers are justifiably concerned that their digital devices are vulnerable 
to intrusions. Close to a million consumers each year are victims of ran-
somware. According to the security firm Damballa, one in five households 
contains devices infected with botnets. Clearly, consumers have to establish 
defenses.
	Does antivirus software protect devices from intrusions? 
Antivirus software can prevent some, but not all, intrusions. It has a good 
track record for blocking exploits that attempt to gain access using a trojan 
or worm, especially if a signature of the exploit exists in the virus database. 
New and unusual exploits, however, may not be caught by antivirus soft-
ware, even when heuristic analysis is deployed. 
Antivirus software cannot be expected to block threats that do not arrive in 
the form of malware. Some attacks take advantage of hardware and soft-
ware vulnerabilities. They are injected using stealth methods and are not 
stopped by antivirus software. Additional defenses are required.
	Is there any defense against zero-day attacks? A zero-day 
attack exploits previously unknown vulnerabilities in software applica-
tions, hardware, and operating system program code. These vulnerabilities 
are discovered by hackers and security experts. Hackers attempt to take 
advantage of the vulnerabilities to infiltrate devices. Security experts attempt 
to correct the vulnerabilities by issuing updates and security patches. 
Configuring applications for automatic updates ensures that security 
patches are applied as soon as they are available. 
Hackers have exploited multiple vulnerabilities in some software. Adobe 
Reader, Java, Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer, Android OS, and Adobe 
Flash account for nearly 80% of all zero-day attacks. It is vital that automatic 
updates are made to software in this list.
Anti-exploit security software offers an additional defense against zero-day 
attacks. Unlike antivirus software that uses a virus database to detect spe-
cific malware threats, anti-exploit software shields certain applications 
against behaviors commonly exhibited by intrusions and other exploits. Anti-
exploit software is not a replacement for antivirus software. It should be used 
in addition to antivirus software as a second line of defense (Figure 7-25).

Anti-exploit software watches for 
suspicious activity taking place 
while using vulnerable applications, 
such as Internet Explorer and Java.

day attacks?

immediately upon arrival.
b.	 They take advantage 
of previously unknown 
vulnerabilities.
c.	 They have zero chance of 
being detected.
d.	 They make updates and 
patches unnecessary.

Make sure automatic updates 
are enabled for Adobe Reader,

SECTION c, Unit 7
Netstat 
Digital devices use communication ports for all kinds of tasks, such as con-
necting to networks, sending and receiving email, exchanging data with 
peripheral devices, and accessing the Web. These ports are exploited by 
hackers to access devices and plant malware. Hackers also use ports to 
communicate with devices in botnets. Preventing unauthorized communi-
cation to and from a digital device is an essential security precaution.
	How do hackers exploit communication ports? Hackers use 
a technique called port scanning to discover which ports are open on a 
device. A port scan pings a packet of data to the port. If a reply is received, 
then the port is open.
Open ports correspond to various services. For example, suppose you’ve 
installed an online game—let’s call it Warcraft Legends—that uses TCP port 
6112 for the game client to communicate with the game server. A hacker 
pinging port 6112 would learn that the port is open. An exploit to penetrate a 
vulnerability of Warcraft Legends would be likely to be successful if directed 
through port 6112. In this way, open ports can be used to deliver malware.
Open ports are also used for communications between botnets and their 
masters. Botnet malware opens ports on victims’ computers. To commu-
nicate with the botnet commander, client bots might use port 6667, for 
example. Data collected by the bot’s keylogger could be sent via port 6667 
to the botmaster, and commands from the botmaster might be relayed to 
infected devices using the same port. Ports that exhibit unusual activity 
could be a sign of a botnet intrusion.
	Can I detect which ports are open? A network utility called Netstat 
produces a detailed list of open ports on a device. Although Netstat is a 
useful diagnostic tool, its report is lengthy and does not clearly separate 
ports needed by legitimate services from those used for nefarious purposes 
(Figure 7-26).

Firewalls 
Suppose that you could erect a digital wall that would block communication 
between your digital devices and the outside world. Although it would pre-
vent unauthorized intrusions, it would also block email, and it would prevent 
access to the Web and a host of online communications services. What if 
you could drill holes through the wall for communications that you know are 
legitimate? That is the theory behind digital firewalls.
	What is a firewall? A firewall is a device or software that is designed 
to block unauthorized access while allowing authorized communications. A 
personal firewall is a software-based deterrent against unauthorized port 
access. A network router can be deployed as a hardware-based firewall.
	How does a personal firewall work? A personal firewall uses 
a set of rules to block data or allow it to enter a digital device. Because 
firewalls offer a good level of defense against unauthorized intrusions, they 
should be installed and correctly configured on all digital devices that have 
network connections. 
Firewalls are included in several security software products, and it is pos-
sible that more than one firewall might be available for use. Only one 
software-based firewall should be active, however, because firewalls have 
a tendency to conflict with each other. 
Most personal firewalls are configured to block all communication unless 
an app and its corresponding communication port are on a list of allowed 
exceptions. When a new app attempts to establish a connection, users are 
notified and given a chance to allow or block the app. The recommended 
configuration for Windows Firewall is shown in Figure 7-27.

about multiple firewalls?

SECTION C, Unit 7
	Is there a list of apps that are allowed through the firewall? 
Firewalls contain a list of allowed apps. Users can view this list and modify it 
by adding or blocking apps. For example, Windows Firewall allows users to 
specify which apps are allowed on private networks and which are allowed 
on public networks (Figure 7-28).
	Are there firewall settings for ports? Yes, most firewall soft-
ware allows users to open and close specific communications ports. With 
Windows Firewall, this process requires multiple steps. Clearly, Microsoft 
developers would prefer that consumers steer clear of this potentially risky 
security configuration. 
	How does a router become a firewall? Unit 3 introduced the 
concept that routers use a network access table (NAT) to convert local IP 
addresses into routable IP addresses that can travel over the Internet. A 
router acts as a firewall to block connections that are not initiated inside a 
local network (Figure 7-29 on the next page). 
Figure 7-28: APPS ALLOWED THROUGH THE FIREWALL
Applications that access the Internet require permission to communicate 
through the firewall. With permission, an app can open a port and use it to 
send and receive data. 
Check marks indicate 
which applications 
are allowed to com-
municate through 
the firewall.
Try It!
It is worth viewing the list of 
connections allowed by your 
firewall from time to time just 
to make sure there aren’t any 
suspicious activities. Open 
the personal firewall on your 
digital device and check the 
configuration.

	Do I need NAT in addition to a personal firewall? Yes. NAT is 
the best line of defense against attacks that originate from the Internet, but 
it does not protect against threats that originate inside a network. Suppose 
that your laptop gets infected with a worm while you are using it at a Wi-Fi 
hotspot. You then take your laptop home and connect it to your LAN. The 
NAT running on your LAN’s router will not prevent the worm from spreading 
to other devices within your LAN because NAT shields communications to 
and from the Internet, not between the devices connected within the local 
network.

Interception BASICS
Networks are an integral part of our digital lives. Important information flows 
over Internet connections and mobile phone services. Consumers cannot, 
however, assume that those connections are secure because a variety of 
exploits allow eavesdroppers to easily intercept data, email, text messages, 
and voice conversations that flow over communication infrastructures. 
	What types of interception exploits are threats? Interception 
exploits that are current threats to consumers include the following:
Spyware. Any software that secretly gathers personal information without 
the victim’s knowledge is classified as spyware. Some spyware is designed 
for advertising and similar commercial purposes, whereas other spyware is 
designed with criminal intent to steal identities or take remote control of a 
victim’s digital device. 
Adware. Spyware called adware monitors Web browsing activity to supply 
ad-serving sites with data used to generate targeted ads. More than a nui-
sance, the data compiled by adware has the potential to become a record of 
an individual’s habits and lifestyle.
Keyloggers. A common type of spyware called a keylogger records key-
strokes and sends them to a hacker who sifts out user passwords to access 
the victim’s accounts. Keyloggers are a common tool of identity thieves and 
industrial spies.
Man-in-the-Middle. In the context of cyber security, an eavesdropping 
exploit is referred to as a man-in-the-middle (MITM or MIM) attack. MITM 
attacks include Evil Twins, address spoofing, digital certificate hacks, and 
IMSI catchers.
	How do man-in-the-middle attacks work? The objective of a 
MITM attack is for a third party to intercept communications between two 
entities without their knowledge. The third party may passively monitor the 
communication or may actively modify the data before it reaches its destina-
tion. The person in the middle impersonates the other two entities to give

SECTION D, Unit 7
Evil Twins
Public Wi-Fi hotspots are everywhere. They are operated by coffee shops, 
colleges, airports, hotels…and hackers. The next time you access a Wi-Fi 
hotspot, your activities could be monitored, intercepted, and altered by 
unauthorized third parties using an exploit called an Evil Twin.
	What is an Evil Twin? An Evil Twin is a LAN server that is designed 
to look like a legitimate Wi-Fi hotspot. Unit 3 explained the basic security 
issues with Wi-Fi hotspots. Many hotspots are unsecured, require no login 
passwords, and carry data over unencrypted connections. When connect-
ing to an unsecured Wi-Fi hotspot, you are blindly trusting that it is what 
it appears to be. The hotspot might be fraudulent, however. Hackers are 
skilled at creating fraudulent sites, referred to as Evil Twins, that resemble 
legitimate sites.
	How does the Evil Twin exploit work? To establish an Evil Twin, 
hackers set up a Wi-Fi hotspot complete with an Internet connection. The 
network is unsecured, so data that travels over the network is not encrypted, 
which allows the hacker to capture any information that users enter as they 
surf the Web, make purchases from online stores, log in to online banking 
services, and enter passwords at social media sites. Users never suspect 
that their activities are monitored because hackers pass the data onto its 
destination after it is captured.
Evil Twins are difficult to detect. To avoid this exploit, refrain from entering 
sensitive data while using any questionable network, and avoid using unse-
cured networks. For example, when looking for Internet access at the Los 
Angeles airport, your digital device might list several networks that appear 
to be operated by the LAX Airport authority. In Figure 7-31, which of the 
Wi-Fi networks is most likely to be an Evil Twin?
Figure 7-31: Which network is the Evil Twin?
QuickCheck
The attack vector for an Evil Twin 
exploit is a(n) _________.
a.	 Wi-Fi hotspot
b.	 email message
c.	 software download
d.	 PUP or PUA
Three public Wi-Fi services appear to be offered at the LAX airport: FreeAirportInternet, LAX-WiFi, and Boingo. The 
remaining Wi-Fi hotspots are operated by individuals using their phones as a tethering device. Of the three public 
Wi-Fi services, FreeAirportInternet is not secured; therefore, it is most likely to be an Evil Twin.

Address Spoofing
As the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protest approached, 
the Chinese government worried that online queries about the event might 
incite further unrest. The solution: tighten Internet censorship. For ordinary 
citizens using government-controlled ISPs, access to Google from within 
China was totally blocked. For academics using a privileged research and 
education network, Chinese censors deployed address spoofing exploits to 
route data through an intermediary site that allowed only politically correct 
queries to proceed.
	What is address spoofing? Broadly speaking, address spoofing 
changes an originating address or a destination address to redirect the flow 
of data between two parties. In the context of security exploits, address 
spoofing can take place on various levels of communication (Figure 7-32).
Figure 7-32: Address Spoofing is used for several Black Hat Exploits
	How does address spoofing affect browsing? Just about every 
exchange of data on the Internet takes place between a client and a server. 
When using a Web app, for example, your browser connects to a server, 
such as www.zoho.com. When collecting Webmail, your browser might 
access www.gmail.com. When you want to enter a Google query, you con-
nect to www.google.com. 
On the Web, URLs correspond to IP addresses. When you use a browser 
to access www.google.com, it should connect you to a Google server 
with a valid IPv6 address such as 2607:f8b0:4007:804::1013. By spoofing 
Google’s IP address, however, Chinese authorities were able to send users 
to a fake Google site. The fake site examined queries and blocked those 
that were destined for banned sites or contained controversial key words.

          DNS address spoof
Changes the IP address that cor-
responds to a URL. The spoofed 
URL directs victims to a fraudulent 
Web site.
	
	
      ARP address spoof
Changes the ARP (Address 
Resolution Protocol) routing table 
on a local area network. The 
spoofed address redirects traffic 
through a secondary, potentially 
malicious device.

SECTION D, Unit 7
Digital Certificate hacks
You can envision how a MITM attack can redirect data packets from a user’s 
client device to a fake Web server. To make intercepted data useless to 
hackers, it would seem reasonable to encrypt it. Google offers end-to-end 
HTTPS encryption, for example, to scramble the text of queries made by 
users and the content of search results. Encryption should hide content from 
prying MITM attacks, but as Chinese users discovered, that is not always 
what happens.
	Why is encryption vulnerable? The current method of encrypting 
communication between a client and a server depends on a security proto-
col called TLS (Transport Layer Security) that checks a digital certificate to 
verify a server’s identity and pass a public key to the client. The client then 
uses the public key to encrypt data that is sent to the server, as shown in 
Figure 7-33.
Figure 7-33: How Digital Certificates Work
	So what is the problem with TLS? Digital certificates can be faked. 
Valid digital certificates are issued by official security authorities. These cer-
tificates are validated or “signed” by the certificate authority. A fake digital 
certificate contains the server’s credentials and an encryption key, but it 
might not have a valid signature. Chinese censors, hackers, and govern-
ment security agencies use fake certificates to snoop on supposedly secure 
communications.
	How does a digital certificate hack work? Consider what you 
know about MITM attacks, and imagine that by using DNS address spoofing, 
all the data from Chinese Internet users gets funneled through a govern-
ment server.

To screen the data and block out queries about the Tiananmen Square pro-
test, for example, users are sent fake digital certificates. These certificates 
encrypt data, but the key is known to the government server. Encrypted 
Google queries and other data can then be decrypted by the government 
server and only those queries that are politically correct are passed along 
to the real destination. Figure 7-34 illustrates how this works.
	Is there a way to stop MITM attacks that use fake digital 
certificates? Although most fake digital certificates contain the server’s 
credentials and an encryption key, they may not contain a valid signature 
from a certificate authority. Most modern browsers flag Web sites that do 
not have a valid digital certificate. Users who pay attention to invalid certifi-
cate notifications, similar to those in Figure 7-35, should be aware that the 
server may be part of an MITM exploit.

SECTION D, Unit 7
IMSI Catchers
While driving through the streets of any city, your cell phone calls, text mes-
sages, and Internet activity could be intercepted by fake cell towers. IMSI 
catchers are yet another MITM exploit.
	What is IMSI? IMSI is an acronym for International Mobile Subscriber 
Identity. It is a 64-bit number that uniquely identifies a cellular device. When 
a device connects to a cellular network, the IMSI is sent from the device 
to the tower. The tower uses the IMSI to determine if the device is a valid 
subscriber. The IMSI can also be used to determine the location of a cellular 
device.
	What is an IMSI catcher? An IMSI catcher is an eavesdropping device 
used for intercepting mobile phone signals and tracking the location of cel-
lular devices. IMSI catchers are used for MITM attacks (Figure 7-36).
	Who operates IMSI catchers? IMSI catchers are not operated by cel-
lular service companies, but rather by law enforcement agencies, criminals, 
and hackers. IMSI catchers are portable. They can be easily moved and 
quickly deployed, for example, during civil unrest when lawmakers want to 
intercept calls among protest organizers. Their use does not require coop-
eration from cellular service providers, and the devices have been used in 
some jurisdictions without a warrant or court authorization.
	How does an IMSI catcher work? Mobile phones that use 3G and 
4G technology have the capability to authenticate mobile towers and deter-
mine if they are operated by a legitimate cellular service. These phones 
would not normally be fooled into connecting to a rogue tower. However, 
most phones switch to an unsecured 2G mode if 3G or 4G service is 
unavailable. An IMSI catcher can block 3G and 4G signals, forcing phones 
to switch to 2G service, which connects to the fake IMSI catcher tower with-
out authenticating.
Sophisticated IMSI catchers may also have the ability to spoof a genuine 
tower and temporarily disable encryption so that voice and text messages 
are sent in an unencrypted format.

IMSI catchers are sometimes 
called stingrays after the brand

Once a mobile device has connected, the IMSI catcher collects the sub-
scriber’s ID and location before forwarding the signals to a legitimate tower 
so that the caller does not notice a disruption in service. IMSI catchers can 
also capture voice calls, text messages, and data streams that emanate 
from hijacked devices (Figure 7-37).
	Are there warning signs that an IMSI catcher is intercept-
ing calls? Callers are rarely aware of IMSI catchers because calls and 
other services appear to proceed as normal. If you notice that the network 
indicator on a device switches to 2G, that could signify a connection con-
trolled by an IMSI catcher. However, some of these interception devices 
spoof the indicator to make it display 3G or 4G when the connection is 
actually 2G. 
Savvy criminals and terrorists tend not to use mobile phones for illegal 
activities. Law-abiding citizens, too, should be mindful that their conversa-
tions may be intercepted.

social Engineering Basics 
One of the most enterprising con artists of all time was a man named George 
Parker who managed to sell the Brooklyn Bridge not once but several times 
to a succession of gullible buyers. Today, con artists have moved into cyber-
space where they devise a continuous barrage of scams to trick consumers 
into parting with passwords, cash, and control of their digital devices. As 
these scams become more sophisticated, they also become more difficult to 
detect. Avoiding them requires a set of security tools and constant vigilance 
on the part of consumers.
What is social engineering? In the context of cyber security, social 
engineering (SE) is a deceptive practice that exploits human psychology by 
inducing victims to interact with a digital device in a way that is not in their 
best interest. Social engineer is a judgment-neutral term for a person who 
devises and carries out a scam in order to accomplish a goal, such as finan-
cial gain, unauthorized access, or service disruption. The target of a social 
engineering exploit is an individual or organization that may be tricked into 
participating in the scam. 
SE attacks can be carried out using a variety of technologies, such as email, 
malware, fraudulent Web sites, SMS, and IRC. For each of these technolo-
gies, social engineers have developed a variety of effective techniques for 
tricking victims, including phishing, pretexting, and pharming. Social engi-
neering attacks are multifaceted. Figure 7-38 offers an overview to help you 
visualize the elements of a social engineering attack.

SECTION E, Unit 7
Figure 7-39: Don’t be fooled by The Stranded Traveler scam 
	Why are people fooled by SE? Social engineering attacks prey on 
human vulnerabilities, such as gullibility, ignorance, curiosity, greed, cour-
tesy, indifference, and carelessness. The “bait” that is set forth in various 
social engineering scams is based on one or more incentives designed to 
compel individuals to participate in the scam. 
The poster child for social engineering scams is called advance fee fraud 
in which a victim is promised a large sum of money in exchange for a bank 
account number from which a small advance fee is withdrawn. These scams 
prey on human greed and the hope that it is possible to “get rich quick” 
without any hard work. According to the FBI, a surprising number of people 
have been duped by these scams, which often appear to originate from a 
Nigerian banker, businessman, or political refugee.
Most email-savvy consumers simply laugh at these preposterous messages 
and delete them, but other scams are much more insidious. For example, 
one current scam arrives as an “urgent” email message from a respected 
community member, such as a teacher, priest, or rabbi, who is traveling 
abroad, has been robbed, and needs a quick loan to return home. The mes-
sage may, in fact, originate from a trusted person’s account—one that has 
been hijacked by a hacker. Scams such as this one prey upon human kind-
ness and the desire to help people who are in need (Figure 7-39).

SPAM
Spam is a nuisance and it accounts for approximately 70% of all email. Not 
only does spam clog up Internet bandwidth that could be put to better use, 
but it reduces individual productivity as users spend time separating use-
less and sometimes offensive messages from legitimate messages sent by 
friends, family, and colleagues. Some spam contains malicious attachments 
and links that lead to fake Web sites.
Where does spam originate? Spam is defined as unsolicited mes-
sages that are usually sent in massive numbers using electronic mail 
systems. It is junk mail that recipients do not request or want. Spam includes 
advertisements from legitimate companies and from scammers attempting 
to trick victims into parting with their money or their personal information. 
Spam sent by scammers often uses spoofed email addresses or addresses 
of unfortunate victims whose computers are part of a botnet used to mass-
mail spam. 
Who gets spam? Everyone. Mass-mailing databases are available at 
bargain basement prices. Obtaining a million email addresses for a mass 
mailing costs less than $200. Databases used by spammers contain millions 
of email addresses. Some of these addresses are legitimately compiled 
from customer lists, but many more are harvested from social media sites, 
discussion forums, Web sites, and other online locations using email extrac-
tor software. Malware also harvests addresses for mass-mailing databases. 
Even more email addresses can be generated by appending the domain of 
a popular email service to names from a telephone directory (Figure 7-40). 
Isn’t spam illegal? Most countries have laws that regulate spam, but 
legal measures seem to have little effect on the volume of unsolicited email 
messages. In 2003, the United States Congress passed a so-called anti-
spam law, the CAN-SPAM Act (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited 
Pornography And Marketing Act of 2003). Ironically, this act confirmed the 
legality of sending unsolicited email messages. The act attempted to regu-
late bulk email by requiring senders to do the following:
• Provide a visible means for recipients to opt out of further messages.
• Include accurate information in the “From” line, a relevant subject line, and 
a legitimate physical address of the sender.
• Avoid using harvested email addresses or false email headers.
The effectiveness of this law is easy to evaluate by simply looking at the 
content of your Inbox and examining a few of the many unsolicited mes-
sages that continue to pile up in your email trash and junk mail folders.

Is it possible to block spam? Most ISPs and email services use filter-
ing techniques to block spam coming from IP addresses and senders that 
are known to generate spam. These services also block messages sent in 
bulk that all contain the same wording. Spammers have developed tech-
niques to bypass these barriers, and spam continues to make its way into 
consumer mailboxes. 
Defending against spam requires careful Inbox management. To reduce the 
amount of spam that lands in your online mailbox, consider the following 
recommendations:
 
Share your primary email address only with people or businesses that 
you trust not to distribute it to others. Businesses sometimes share 
mailing lists with affiliates, and lists may fall into the hands of illegiti-
mate spammers. Keeping your email address off one list can keep it 
from propagating to multiple lists.
 
Never reply to spam. Mailing lists contain a high percentage of invalid 
addresses. Replying to a spam message marks your email address as 
valid, which only generates more unwanted mail.
 
Do not click links in spam messages. If you are curious about where a 
link might lead, hover over it with the pointer and look at the destina-
tion URL. Links in spam often are designed to direct victims to fake 
sites where malware is waiting.
 
Do not open attachments in email messages unless you are certain 
that the sender is trusted and the attached file is expected.
 
Use a complex email address with a user name that would not be 
found in a telephone directory. For example, add a number or symbol 
to your name.
 
Use a disposable email address in situations where an email address 
is required but you don’t want to receive solicitations. Disposable email 
addresses are useful when registering to use Web apps and when 
signing up for merchant loyalty programs.
 
When displaying your real email address—for example, on your Web 
site—disguise it by posting it as a graphic. You can create a graphic 
containing your email address by using graphics software, such as 
Paint, typing your name, and saving it as a PNG file.
 
Use an opt-out link only if the email originated from a reputable national 
company. Before clicking the opt-out link, hover over it to make sure it 
leads to a legitimate URL.
 
Remember that if a deal seems too good to be true, it is probably a 
scam.
 
In iCloud, delete spam before opening it by using MailtoPreferences 
Viewing and deselecting “Display remote images in HTML messages.”
 
Be suspicious of shortened URLs that do not reveal the genuine 
domain.
 
Be wary of email messages addressed to “undisclosed recipients” or 
addressed to numerous recipients that you don’t know.
 
Be cautious of email messages addressed to your email user name 
rather than your real name.
 
Use the spam filters provided by your email client.

How do spam filters work? A spam filter uses a set of rules to exam-
ine email messages and determine which are spam. Messages that are 
identified as spam can be blocked, deleted, or moved to a junk mail folder. 
There are four common types of spam filters:
• Content filters examine the content within a message for certain words 
or phrases commonly used in spam emails.
• Header filters review the email header for falsified information, such as 
spoofed IP addresses.
• Blacklist filters block mail that originates from IP addresses of known 
spammers.
• Permission filters block or allow mail based on the sender’s address.
Blacklist and header filtering is usually performed by ISPs and email ser-
vices, such as Google and Yahoo!. Email clients and Webmail services 
provide consumers with permission filters and contact filters. Knowing how 
to use these filters is handy for blocking spam that can slip through filters 
operating upstream at your ISP or email service (Figure 7-42).
Figure 7-42: Gmail Spam Filters
The simplest spam filter blocks a specific sender 
based on his or her email address. That tech-
nique works on unwanted mail from creepy 
individuals, but most spammers send mail from 
a spoofed address that is fraudulent. The spam-
mer will never use the same address twice, so 
blocking it does little to curtail spam.
Some spam filters can be set up to allow email only 
from people who are included in your contacts list or 
address book. This technique introduces a problem, 
however, because email from new acquaintances 
who are not yet in your address book is blocked. 
When using a permission filter, it is important to peri-
odically check the junk mail folder in case legitimate 
messages are there.
Suppose you’re receiving a barrage of spam 
about “unbelievable stock deals.” If the mes-
sages contain similar wording, you may be able 
to devise a content filter to block similar spam 
in the future. The trick is to create a specific 
filter rather than one that is general enough to 
block legitimate messages. 
You can also use email filters to create “ham.” In the world 
of email, ham is like a password that verifies the validity of 
a sender. For example, suppose you expect email from visi-
tors to your Web site or blog. Tell your visitors to include 
a ham password, such as “BlogVisitor,” in the subject line 
of their messages. Set your spam filter to require the pass-
word for any messages that don’t originate from people 
who are in your contacts list.

filters?

b.	 Email clients

PHISHING
Even as consumers became more suspicious of spam, social engineers 
continued to evolve their techniques to new levels of sophistication that prey 
on human curiosity and other easily manipulated traits. Phishing exploits are 
responsible for some of the most effective social engineering scams. A look 
at some examples reveals why.
What is phishing? Phishing is an email scam that masquerades as a 
message from a legitimate company or agency of authority, such as the IRS. 
The goal of a phishing scam is usually to obtain private information, includ-
ing login passwords and bank card numbers. Phishing scams often contain 
infected attachments or include links to fake Web sites infected with mal-
ware. Phishing email messages are typically the first salvo in a barrage of 
exploits that infect a device with malware, use keyloggers to collect personal 
information, set up a backdoor for intrusions, and link a device to a botnet.
Some of the most common phishing attacks appear to originate from FedEx, 
UPS, DHL, or the U.S. Postal Service and pertain to package delivery ser-
vices. Tax scams in messages headed with an official IRS seal are also 
prevalent, as are scams that use realistic logos of financial institutions, gov-
ernment agencies, and merchants (Figure 7-43).
What is the best strategy for dealing with phishing attacks? 
Phishing attacks are not always easy to identify. Their messages may 
appear to originate from trusted businesses. Although some phishing mes-
sages include misspellings and bad grammar, others contain no such errors. 
Phishing messages are more compelling than most spam, and the tempta-
tion to click the links they contain is strong.
Phishing exploits are a type of spam, and both require the same type of 
vigilance on the part of consumers: Take steps to keep your email address 
off of mass-mailing lists, use spam filters, avoid opening attachments, and 
do not click links in email messages unless you are certain that they lead to 
a trusted source.

SECTION E, Unit 7
PHARMING
Email is not the only source of social engineering attacks. The Web is host 
to its share of fraudulent sites and other scams. Using screenshots and 
graphics tools, for example, it is easy to construct Web sites that closely 
resemble those of trusted online retailers. But how are consumers tricked 
into visiting these sites? That’s the purpose of pharming exploits. 
What is pharming? Pharming redirects Web site traffic to fraudulent 
Web sites that distribute malware, collect personal data, sell counterfeit 
products, and perpetrate other scams. Fraudulent Web sites often have 
URLs that are similar to the legitimate sites they imitate. A very simple 
exploit is to establish a look-alike site at a URL, such as www.amzon.com, 
that is a common misspelling of a legitimate online storefront. Careless con-
sumers who leave out the “a” end up at the look-alike Web site. 
Another pharming strategy is to use a URL that sounds like a legiti-
mate merchant. For example, a gang of offshore scammers selling 
counterfeit Louis Vuitton handbags hoped consumers would think the URL 
www.nordstrom-louisvuitton.net was affiliated with Nordstrom department 
stores. 
How is pharming related to the domain name system? The 
most insidious pharming attacks are implemented by DNS spoofing, which 
was explained in Unit 3. Hackers infiltrate a domain name system server to 
alter the IP address of a legitimate site and send visitors to a fraudulent site 
instead. Past pharming attacks have redirected URLs for Web sites such 
as The New York Times, Google Malaysia, ShareThis, and The Huffington 
Post.
Pharming attacks carried out by DNS spoofing cannot be detected by anti-
virus software or spyware removal software. DNS spoofing is eventually 
detected and corrected by domain registrars. Until corrections are in place, 
consumers have little defense against such attacks except to remain alert 
to any details that don’t look quite right when visiting familiar Web sites. 
Pharming attacks can also be carried out by malware that changes an 
IP address in a file called Hosts. This file contains URLs and their corre-
sponding IP addresses, which override the mapping accessed from a 
domain name server. Malware that enters a device, perhaps in a trojan, 
seeks out the Hosts file and inserts a bogus URL. For example, the entry 
34.123.67.999 www.facebook.com sets the IP address of Facebook to a 
look-alike hacker’s site (Figure 7-44). Because malware is used to carry out 
this pharming technique, it may be detected by antivirus software.
Figure 7-44: The Hosts File can be hacked by injecting a bogus URL
In the Hosts file modified by 
malware, the URL for a hacker’s 
Web site is used to override 
the correct URL supplied by a 
domain name server.

What is the difference between 
phishing and pharming?
a.	 Phishing is a social 
engineering exploit, but 
pharming is not.

by antivirus software, but 
pharming cannot.
c.	 Phishing is based on

DNS, whereas pharming 
exploits spoof email headers.

What is Safe Browsing? Safe Browsing is a service offered by 
Google that checks URLs against a list of suspicious Web site URLs. Stay 
alert for clues that indicate which sites are safe and which are not (Figure

How can I activate Safe Browsing? Chrome, Safari, and Firefox use 
Safe Browsing to alert users about sites to avoid. Microsoft offers a similar 
service called SmartScreen Filter (Figure 7-46).

rogue ANTIVIRUS
“WARNING! Your computer may be infected with spyware.” When that 
window pops up, is it a warning generated by your antivirus software or a 
social engineering scam designed to prey on your desire to take precautions 
against malware? Knowing the difference between a real and a fake virus 
warning can prevent you from becoming a victim of fraud and identity theft.
What is a rogue antivirus exploit? Anyone who owns a digital device 
knows the dangers of malware. Seeing a notification that your device has a 
virus makes you want to take immediate action to eradicate it before further 
damage is done. Social engineers use fake virus notifications to prey on 
consumers’ aversion to malware and their sense of urgency to eradicate it. 
A rogue antivirus exploit usually begins with a virus warning and an offer 
to disinfect the infected device. The goal of this exploit is to trick consumers 
into clicking a link that downloads malware. Some of these fraudulent alerts 
offer a free virus scan or download, which often doesn’t work or actually 
infects devices with the dangerous malware it is supposed to protect against. 
Other rogue antivirus exploits charge consumers for bogus software, obtain 
personal information, or carry out malware attacks. 
Fake virus alerts commonly appear when browsing the Web at slightly 
sketchy Web sites. These alerts appear as pop-up windows. Can you tell 
which alerts in Figure 7-47 are real and which are fake?
What’s the best defense against rogue AV? Social engineers who 
launch rogue AV attacks depend on the victim’s sense of urgency and igno-
rance about legitimate antivirus alerts. Your best defense against rogue AV 
is to protect your devices with legitimate antivirus software and make sure 
that you can identify the virus alerts it generates. If you are familiar with the 
alerts generated by your legitimate software, you will not be fooled by fake 
alerts.
Figure 7-47: Malware Alerts: Which are fake?
Terminology
Rogue antivirus exploits are 
sometimes referred to as rogue 
AV or rogue security software. 
Fake virus alerts can look realistic, so it is important to be familiar with the 
legitimate alerts displayed by your antivirus software. The two warnings on 
the left are fake. The three warnings on the right were produced by legitimate 
antivirus software.

PUAs 
Some software is not exactly malware, but it is a nuisance. It takes up 
residence on a digital device and seems impossible to disable or remove. 
What’s up with that?
What is this stuff? The acronym PUP stands for potentially unwanted 
program. A similar acronym, PUA, stands for potentially unwanted applica-
tion. The terms are used interchangeably. The most common types of PUPs 
and PUAs are toolbars and alternative browsers. If you suddenly notice 
that an odd browser has become the default and your attempts to reset the 
default browser to Chrome, IE, or Safari fail, then your computer is likely to 
have a PUA.
How do PUAs end up on my devices? PUAs are installed using 
social engineering techniques. Knowing that consumers often speed 
through the installation process, social engineers insert an option for 
accepting an application that “enriches” or “enhances” a function such as 
Web browsing. If you fail to read the fine print and accept the application, 
the PUA is installed along with the application you’ve downloaded. 
If you are not alert during the installation process and receive a PUA, use 
a tool such as Malwarebytes, which is designed to identify and eradicate 
PUAs and malware that already reside on a digital device (Figure 7-48).

Issue: What’s WRONG WITH ONLINE VOTING?
American idol racks up more than 100 
million votes each week, collected from text mes-
sages, dial-in calls, and Facebook links. You can also 
vote online for Dancing with the Stars and the Miss 
America Competition. Yet when it comes to voting 
in local or national elections, you’re required to trek 
down to your local polling place and wait in line.
In the early days of the Internet, online voting looked 
easy. However, the feasibility of an easy solution 
died with the advent of viruses, worms, bots, denial-
of-service attacks, unauthorized intrusion attempts, 
and the growing threat of international terrorists. 
Computer scientists, systems analysts, security 
experts, and election officials now have a pretty good 
idea of the various problems associated with online 
voting, but they disagree about the best solutions.
Whether manual or electronic, there are six basic 
requirements for a voting system (see box). Online 
voting meets some of these basic requirements better 
than current voting methods, but it faces challenges in 
adequately fulfilling other requirements.
Online voting has several advantages. It is conve-
nient. Voters can cast ballots from home or work, or 
even while on vacation. It is quick. Casting an online 
ballot doesn’t require driving to a polling station and 
waiting in line. 
Because of its advantages, online voting has the 
potential to attract net-savvy young voters who his-
torically have voted in smaller numbers than other 
segments of the population. It also simplifies the vot-
ing process for elderly and homebound voters. The 
convenience of online voting might also increase par-
ticipation in local elections.
Online voting has the potential to decrease the 
number of ballots that are invalidated because of 
procedural problems, such as failing to completely 
punch out the chad on a ballot card or checking more 
than one candidate on a paper ballot. Voting software 
can prevent voters from erroneously selecting more 
than one candidate and can make sure that voters 
are able to revise their selections without invalidating 
their ballots. 
Voter fraud includes voting multiple times, stuffing 
the ballot box with votes from nonexistent voters, 
and buying votes. To reduce voter fraud, voters 
must be identified to make sure they are eligible to 
vote and they vote only once. When a person logs 
on to vote remotely, it is difficult to verify his or her 
identity. Passwords are not effective in controlling 
fraud because they can be shared and distributed. 
Biometric devices that offer more positive identifica-
tion are not typically part of most digital devices. 
Online voting advocates point out, however, that 
traditional voting practices are also vulnerable to 
exploits such as disrupting polling places and steal-
ing absentee ballots. Long lines at polling places 
produce something similar to online denial-of-service 
attacks.
Politically, skeptics of online voting are uncomfort-
able with its effect on voting demographics. Some 
Republican strategists are concerned about a sudden 
upswing in young voters—not a block of traditionally 
Republican supporters—who might take advantage 
of online polling. Democrats, on the other hand, have 
intimated that online voting would disproportionately 
increase the number of high-income voters because 
many economically deprived voters do not have 
access to a digital device with an Internet connection. 
For a democracy to function properly, its citizens 
should be confident that the electoral system is hon-
est and works. Online voting presents some sticky 
technological and social challenges that must be 
resolved before it can be used with confidence. 
• Encourage and allow voters to register. 
• Provide voters with an easy-to-decipher ballot. 
• Allow voters to make their selections, review them, 
and revise them before casting their ballots.
• Collect ballots and filter out those that are invalid or 
fraudulent.
• Accurately tabulate votes from every valid ballot.
• Allow officials to recount ballots if an election is chal-
lenged.

What Do You Think?
 ISSUE
TRY IT! Early enthusiasts of online voting envisioned it as a 
technological solution to the problems of a representative democracy. 
They expected the rapid emergence of a new e‑democracy in which 
citizens had a direct vote in every issue with the ease of dashing off 
an email or logging on to a Web site. Here’s your chance to explore 
the pros and cons of online voting from American Idol to high-stakes 
politics.
	 More than a decade ago, an online voting project called Secure 
Electronic Registration and Voting Experiment (SERVE) was initi-
ated by the U.S. government. Read the report Security Analysis 
of SERVE (available online as a PDF) to find out why the project 
was scrapped. Then rearrange the items in Table 1 of the report 
according to the severity of each threat based on today’s security 
exploits. 
	 Every year, TIME magazine holds a popular vote for the 100 
most influential people. In 2009, the vote was hacked. Who was 
responsible for the hack, and how did they do it?
	 A major worry about online voting is that people might be able 
to vote multiple times. The obvious solution would be to attach 
your Social Security number to your vote; however, that would vio-
late the concept of secret ballots. A proposal called Pretty Good 
Democracy offers a solution to the “vote early, vote often” prob-
lem. What is it, and do you think it will work?
	 Critics of current online voting technology make the point that 
national elections are different from picking the winner of American 
Idol or Dancing with the Stars. Since 2006, however, the country 
of Estonia has had an online voting option. To compare its voting 
protocol with reality show voting, use the Web to gather informa-
tion for the table below.

Plagiarism. Buying a term paper from a company or an individual and 
turning it in as your own. Copying words directly from someone else’s print or 
online work. Paraphrasing without attribution. These are all forms of plagiarism.
Common knowledge. To avoid plagiarism in your written work, 
you should include citations for any statements that are not common knowledge. 
Common knowledge includes ideas and facts that can be found in many places 
and are known by many people. Material that is based on the work, ideas, or 
statements of other people is not common knowledge and needs a citation for its 
source. Include a citation for:
Information Tools: Your Own Words
• Any statement that refers to a 
research study or is based on its con-
clusions
• Any statement or graph that includes 
statistics
• Any word-for-word spoken or written 
quotations
• Any statement that restates or sum-
marizes another person’s original 
ideas
Paraphrasing. Citations are required even when you paraphrase. 
Changing the words of an original source is not sufficient. You must cite the 
source whenever you borrow ideas as well as words.
Acceptable paraphrasing should not be too similar to the original wording, yet 
you must be careful not to change the idea behind the original wording. Your 
paraphrase also requires a citation to the original source. Suppose you find this 
passage on Carla Charmer’s blog that contains material you’d like to include in a 
mid-term report:
A Michigan man who accessed his wife’s email account while she was allegedly carrying on an 
affair faces up to five years in prison. He is being prosecuted for violating a state law typically used 
against hackers and identity thieves. It is shocking that a person could be charged with a felony for 
reading his spouse’s email. 
There are several ways in which you can use this material. Some ways are more 
ethical than others. 
A Michigan man faces five years in prison on charges that he violated a 
state law by reading his wife’s email without permission.
It is shocking that a person could be charged with a felony for reading 
his wife’s email. A Michigan man who read his wife’s email while she was 
supposedly having an affair faces up to five years in prison for violating a 
state law usually used for identity thieves and hackers.
It came as quite a shock that a Michigan man could be charged with a 
felony and face up to five years in the slammer simply for reading his 
wife’s email while she was supposedly having an affair with another man. 
Blogger Carla Charmer found it “shocking that a person could be charged 
with a felony for reading his spouse’s email.”
This information is common knowl-
edge. You can use it without citing the 
original source.
This paraphrase is too close to the

Try It! Explore the differences between original and plagiarized material by answering the follow-
ing questions.
	 Which of these statements would not need a citation because it is common knowledge?
	
a. While it is fairly easy to build a slow crawler that downloads one or a few pages per second for a short 
period of time, building a high-performance system that can download hundreds of millions of pages over 
several weeks presents a number of challenges in system design, I/O and network efficiency, and robust-
ness and manageability.
	
b. Search engines, such as Google, include software called a Web crawler that visits Web sites and indexes 
the material it finds there. This material can later be accessed by entering keywords at a search engine site.
	
c. Experimental results show that a distributed Web crawler can more effectively visit Web pages than a 
single Web crawler.
	 Which of these statements would need a citation because it refers to statements based on statistics?
	
a. The main problem search engines have to deal with is the size and rate of change of the Web, with no 
search engine indexing more than one-third of the publicly available Web.
	
b. Back in 2004, the average working day consisted of dealing with 46 phone calls, 15 internal memos, 19 items 
of snail mail, and 22 email messages.
	
c. Search engines deal with a vast amount of material. The process of collecting and organizing that material 
becomes ever greater as the Web expands.
	 Which of these statements should have citations because it refers to a research study or its 
conclusions?
	
a. We ran a crawl of more than 100 million Web pages on about 5 million hosts. The crawl was performed 
over a period of 18 days; however, the crawler was not continuously in operation during this time. Of the 
138 million pages cataloged, more than 400,000 produced a 403 error indicating that access was forbid-
den.
	
b. Given the current size of the Web, even large search engines cover only a portion of the publicly available 
part. A report from the Websonite Group indicates that large-scale search engines index no more than 40% 
to 70% of the indexable Web.
	
c. You can study the Web all you want, but there will still be more to learn.
	 Use a search engine to find the above quotation, then do the following: 
	
a. Create an MLA citation for the original source.
	
b. Create an acceptable paraphrase for the quotation using an in-context 
citation.
	
c. Write at least two sentences on the same topic that would be common 
knowledge and not need a citation.
	 Plagiarism scanning services, such as Turnitin and Viper, make it easy 
for instructors to check the originality of your work. Before turning in a 
paper, you can make sure you’ve cited all relevant sources by running 
your document through the student version of Turnitin or a free plagia-
rism scanner such as Viper, Grammarly, Dustball, or Dupli Checker.

“Can ordinary Americans like you and me sue the government for illegally spying on them? When it 
comes to the NSA surveillance program, the government itself says the answer is no. After all, since it’s 
a secret program you don’t really know if you’re being spied on. And if you don’t know you’re being spied 
on, you have no standing to sue.”

Technology in Context: Law Enforcement
Sirens wail. Blue lights flash. A speeding 
car slows and pulls off to the side of the road. It looks 
like a routine traffic stop, but the patrol car is outfit-
ted with a mobile data computer. The police officers 
on this high-tech force have already checked the 
speeding car’s license plate number and description 
against a database of stolen cars and vehicles alleg-
edly used in kidnapping and other crimes. 
Mounted in the dashboard of marked and unmarked 
police cars, a mobile data computer resembles a lap-
top computer with its flat-panel screen and compact 
keyboard. Unlike a consumer-grade laptop, however, 
the computers in police cruisers use hardened tech-
nology designed to withstand extreme conditions, 
such as high temperatures in parked vehicles. The 
dashboard-mounted computer communicates with 
an office-based server using a wireless link, such as 
short-range radio, mobile phone technology, or Wi-Fi. 
With this wireless link, police officers can access data 
from local, state, and national databases. 
One national database, the National Crime 
Information Center (NCIC), is maintained by the FBI 
and can be accessed by authorized personnel in 
local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. 
The system can process more than 5 million queries 
per day related to stolen vehicles, wanted criminals, 
missing persons, violent gang members, stolen guns, 
and members of terrorist organizations. The officers 
who pulled over the speeding car received informa-
tion from the NCIC that the car was stolen, so they 
activate their body cameras and approach the vehi-
cle with caution. 
Technology for wearable body cameras has been 
available for several years, but police departments 
were slow to add these devices to officer’s toolbelts. 
Costs and privacy concerns—for both the officers 
and the civilians they serve—prompted a wait-and-
see attitude. In 2014, however, a disputed incident 
between a police officer and an unarmed civilian in 
Ferguson, Missouri, brought national attention to 
the need for documentary evidence of encounters 
between police and civilians. 
Body cameras offered part of the solution to these 
disputes. A year-long pilot program in Rialto, 
California, showed a significant reduction in citizen 
complaints against police. The report concluded that 
filming improved the behavior of both the officers and 
the civilians they interacted with. Body cameras and 
the protocols that govern their use are still a work 
in progress to ensure that footage is not hacked, 
leaked, or tampered with.
Following protocol, the officers in our stolen car sce-
nario arrest the car’s occupant and take him to the 
police station for booking. 
At the police station, digital cameras flash and the 
suspect’s mug shot is automatically entered into an 
automated warrants and booking system. The ­system 
stores the suspect’s complete biographical and arrest 
information, such as name, aliases, addresses, Social 
Security number, charges, and arrest date. The sys-
tem also checks for outstanding warrants against the 
suspect, such as warrants for other thefts. Booking 
agents can enter those charges into the system, 
assign a new inmate to a cell, log his or her personal 
items, and print a photo ID or wrist band. 
Automated warrants and booking systems have 
been proven to increase police productivity. New 
York City’s system handles more than 300,000 book-
ings per year, with gains in productivity that have 
put nearly 300 officers back into action investigating 
crimes and patrolling neighborhoods.
As part of the booking process, suspects are finger-
printed. A standard fingerprint card, sometimes called 
a ten-print card, contains inked prints of the fingers 
on each hand, plus name, date of birth, and other 
arrest information. Now, however, instead of using 
ink, a biometric scanning device can electronically

capture fingerprints. Text information is entered using 
a keyboard and stored with digital fingerprint images. 
The fingerprint information can be transmitted in digi-
tal format from local law enforcement agencies to the 
FBI’s Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification 
System (IAFIS). This biometric identification system 
uses digital imaging technology and sophisticated 
algorithms to analyze fingerprint data. IAFIS can clas-
sify arriving prints for storage or search for a match in 
its database containing 66 million criminal prints, 25 
million civilian prints, and prints from 73,000 known 
and suspected terrorists. 
Conventional crimes, such as car theft, are often 
solved by using standard investigative techniques 
with information from computer databases. To solve 
cybercrimes, however, the special skills of computer 
forensic investigators are often required. 
Computer forensics is the scientific examination and 
analysis of data located on computer storage media, 
which is conducted to offer evidence of computer 
crimes in court. Computer crimes can be separated 
into two categories. The first includes crimes that 
use computers, such as transmitting trade secrets to 
competitors, reproducing copyrighted material, and 
distributing child pornography. The second includes 
crimes targeted at computers, such as denial-of-
service attacks on servers, Web site vandalism, data 
theft, and destructive viruses. Computer forensics 
can be applied to both categories.
Whether investigators suspect that a digital device is 
the origin of a cyber-attack or contains evidence, the 
first step in the forensic process is to use disk imaging 
software to make an exact replica of the information 
stored on the hard disk or SSD drive. The disk image 
is collected on a write-once medium that cannot be 
altered with planted evidence, and the forensic scien-
tist begins analyzing the disk image data with simple 
search software that looks through files for keywords 
related to the crime. In the case of the Gap-Toothed 
Bandit who was convicted for robbing nine banks, 
analysis of the disk image revealed word processing 
files containing notes he handed to tellers demanding 
money. 
Criminals might attempt to delete files with incrimi-
nating evidence, but a good forensic scientist can 
retrieve data from deleted files with undelete software 
or data recovery software. Cloud storage, temporary 
Internet files, and cache files can also yield evidence 
that points law enforcement officers to Web sites the 
suspect visited that might be fronts for illegal activity. 
When a network is the target of a cyber-attack, 
forensic investigators use three techniques to track 
the source. The first option is to make an immediate 
image of the server’s hard disk and look through its 
log files for evidence of activity coming from unau-
thorized IP addresses. The second technique is 
to monitor the intruder by watching login attempts, 
changes to log files, and file access requests. 
Sophisticated intruders might be able to detect such 
monitoring, however, and cover their tracks. The third 
technique is to create a “honeypot”—an irresistible 
computer system or Web site containing fake infor-
mation that allows investigators to monitor hackers 
until identification is possible. 
Despite the many techniques and tools available 
to forensic investigators, they have three main 
constraints. First, they must adhere to privacy regu-
lations and obtain warrants to set up wiretaps or 
gather information from ISPs about their custom-
ers. Second, they must scrupulously document their 
procedures so that the evidence they produce can-
not be discredited in court as planted or fabricated. 
Third, forensic investigators must examine a wide 
range of alternatives pertaining to the crime, such as 
the chance that an IP address or email address used 
to commit a cybercrime might belong to an innocent 
bystander being spoofed by the real hacker. 
Privacy, documentation, and evidentiary constraints 
cost forensic investigators time, and failure to adhere 
to strict standards can sometimes allow criminals 
to avoid conviction and penalties. But even within 
these constraints, careful forensic investigation is an 
important aspect of catching and convicting high-tech 
criminals.

Flipped Class Projects
Critical Thinking
What motivates hackers to create malware and 
launch cyber-attacks? Make a list of incentives, 
including financial and psychological, that might be 
the basis for attacks. Next, consider the types of 
cyber-attacks presented in Unit 7. Classifying them 
according to severity may help you form some 
hypotheses about the incentives behind various 
attacks. Create a threat matrix with vertical head-
ings for attack types and horizontal headings for 
incentives. When your matrix is complete, browse 
online to find out if your thoughts are in line with 
expert assessments.
Group Project
You see a similar scenario on television or in mov-
ies: a spy, hacker, or law enforcement agent needs 
to bypass a password. The password is cracked in 
three or four tries. How realistic is that? Work with a 
group of five classmates and try to guess one of the 
passwords used by a member of your group. Does 
that sound risky? If someone can guess your pass-
word, it is pitifully weak and you should change it 
immediately!
Cyberclassroom
One of the obstacles to distance education ini-
tiatives is securing the testing environment for 
students who are off-site in an unproctored envi-
ronment. Several companies offer secure online 
testing products, but do they effectively prevent 
cheating? Work with a partner to brainstorm the 
requirements for exam security. Research an online 
exam monitoring product to determine its effective-
ness. How easily could you defeat the security 
measures? 
Multimedia Project
Envisioning how black hat exploits work can be 
difficult. YouTube contains several videos about 
security topics. What can they tell you? Choose a 
security topic from this unit. You might choose a 
specific exploit, such as ransomware or IMSI catch-
ers, or you might want to select a security product 
or a social engineering controversy. Describe the 
three best videos on the topic you selected. 
Resume Builder
Job hunting can be stressful enough without wor-
rying about scams, but con artists know that job 
seekers are particularly vulnerable to fake job offers 
and various head-hunting scams. When preparing 
for a job search, get your resume in order, but also 
get familiar with scams that circulate to job seekers. 
To begin, look for information on fake job phishing, 
reshipping, check-cashing, money laundering, and 
work-at-home scams. Next, locate guidelines on 
how to avoid job scams. Summarize what you find 
in a printed brochure, blog post, or Pinterest board.
Globalization
Because the Internet connects computers all over 
the globe, you might expect that malware and 
black hat exploits would be evenly spread among 
countries. That is far from the case. Search online 
for statistics about malware incidents by country. 
Which countries are hardest hit by malware? Also, 
examine the other side of the issue to gather statis-
tics about which countries are the source of most 
malware attacks. You might be surprised by what 
you discover.

Interactive Summary
SECTION A:  
 trans-
forms a message or data file in such a way that its contents 
are hidden from unauthorized readers. An original mes-
sage or file that has not yet been encrypted is referred to as 
 or cleartext. An encrypted mes-
sage or file is referred to as 
 . Data 
can be encrypted one file at a time, or an entire storage volume 
can be encrypted. 
 protocols, such 
as passwords, PINs, and fingerprint scanners, are the first 
line of defense against data thieves and snoopers. The single 
most effective security measure for digital devices is to pass-
word protect access to them. A(n) 
 
password is difficult to hack. Conventional wisdom tells us 
that strong passwords are at least 
 
characters in length and include one or more uppercase letters, 
numbers, and symbols. A(n) 
 force 
attack uses password-cracking software to generate every 
possible combination of letters, numerals, and symbols. A(n) 
 attack helps hackers guess your 
password by stepping through a dictionary containing word lists 
in common languages. Password 
 
is a measure of a password’s unpredictability. For example, 
the entropy of a four-digit iPhone passcode is 14 bits. The 
core function of a password 
 
(sometimes called a keychain) is to store user IDs with their 
corresponding passwords. Passwords can be stored in the 
 , locally, or on a USB drive.
SECTION B: Malware refers to any computer pro-
gram designed to surreptitiously enter a digital device. The 
action carried out by malware code is referred to as a(n) 
 . There are several types of 
malware. A computer 
 is a set 
of self-replicating program instructions that surreptitiously 
attaches itself to a legitimate 
file on a host computer. This type of malware spreads when 
people exchange infected files on CDs, as email attach-
ments, and downloads. They can also be inadvertently 
obtained from unauthorized app stores. Through a process 
called side- 
 , an app from a 
source other than an official app store is installed on a device. 
Modern 
 are used to hide mali-
cious code by replacing parts of the operating system with 
modified code. A computer 
 is a 
self-replicating, self-distributing program designed to carry 
out unauthorized activity on a victim’s device. They are usu-
ally 
 executable programs that 
can spread themselves from one device to another without 
any assistance from victims. 
are a type of standalone malware that masquerades as use-
ful utilities or applications, which victims download and install 
unaware of their destructive nature. Antivirus software is a 
type of utility software that looks for and eradicates malware 
by watching for virus 
 or through 
a(n) 
 analysis that examines the 
behavior of suspicious files. When antivirus software detects 
malware, it can try to remove the infection, put the file into 
 , or simply delete the file. Antivirus 
software is an essential security tool. It should be installed, 
properly configured, and updated regularly.

SECTION C: An online intrusion takes place when 
an unauthorized person gains access to a digital device by 
using an Internet connection and exploiting vulnerabilities 
in hardware or software. A(n) 
 
Access Trojan is malware that arrives in a trojan, dis-
guised as legitimate software, and then sets up a(n) 
 
 that provides unauthorized 
access to a victim’s device. Smartphones are the top tar-
get for 
 that locks a device and 
then requests payment for an unlocking code. Malware with 
 control capability is programmed 
for off-site control of the camera or microphone on a victim’s 
device. Hackers who gain control over several computers 
can organize them into a client-server network known as 
a(n) 
 . This network is cloaked 
from the victims, who continue to use their devices as usual 
and are unaware of botnet activities that may be taking place 
behind the scenes. A(n) 
  -day 
attack exploits previously unknown vulnerabilities in soft-
ware applications, hardware, and operating system program 
code. To defend against these attacks, consumers can 
install anti- 
 security software. 
Defense against intrusions is also offered by personal 
 , which block unauthorized 
 access. A network router can be 
deployed as a hardware-based firewall.
SECTION D:  There are several types of 
 exploits that surreptitiously 
capture data. Any software that secretly gathers personal 
information without the victim’s knowledge is classified as 
 . 
 moni-
tors Web browsing activity to supply ad-serving sites with data 
used to generate targeted ads. A(n) 
 
records keystrokes and sends them to a hacker. The objec-
tive of an MITM attack is for a third party to intercept 
communications between two entities without their knowl-
edge. An MITM exploit executed at Wi-Fi hotspots is called 
the 
 . MITM attacks are also car-
ried out by 
 the addresses in 
email messages, IP packets, 
 
servers, and ARP routing tables. Data sent over encrypted 
channels also falls victim to MITM attacks that use fake 
digital 
 . An MITM attack that tar-
gets cellular data eavesdrops on conversations using a(n) 
 catcher.
SECTION E: In the context of cyber security, social 
engineering (SE) is a deceptive practice that exploits human 
 by inducing victims to interact 
with a digital device in a way that is not in their best inter-
est. Many of these attacks begin with  
 , 
which is defined as unsolicited messages that are usu-
ally sent in massive numbers using electronic mail 
systems. A spam 
 uses a set 
of rules to examine email messages and determine which 
are spam. There are four common types of spam filters. 
 filters examine the content 
within a message for certain words or phrases commonly 
used in spam emails. 
 filters 
review the email header for falsified information, such as 
spoofed IP addresses. 
 filters 
block mail that originates from IP addresses of known spam-
mers. 
 filters block or allow mail 
based on the sender’s address. 
 
is an email scam that masquerades as a message from a(n) 
legitimate company or agency of authority, such as the IRS. 
 redirects Web site traffic to fraud-
ulent Web sites that distribute malware, collect personal data, 
sell counterfeit products, and perpetrate other scams. A rogue 
 exploit usually begins with a virus 
warning and an offer to disinfect the infected device. Some 
software is not exactly malware, but it is a nuisance. A(n) 
 (Hint: Use the acronym) takes up 
residence on a digital device and seems impossible to disable 
or remove.

LAB: Chrome Lockdown
EVERY WEB SITE IS A POTENTIAL RISK. You know the exploits: malware, infected downloads, spyware, fraudulent 
Web sites, rogue JavaScripts...the list goes on. Antivirus software, firewalls, and other security software help to block 
some of these exploits, but they may leave cracks that allow exploits to slip into digital devices. In this lab, you’ll find out 
how to lock down the Google Chrome browser to help defend against common online attacks.
REQUIREMENTS: 
For this lab, you’ll need a desktop or laptop computer with Google Chrome installed. Chrome is a free browser. If it is 
not currently installed on your device, take a moment to do so before proceeding. (Note: The instructions for this lab 
apply to the version of Chrome that was available when this book went to print. If these instructions seem not to apply, 
check for updated instructions at www.infoweblinks.com/np2016/Unit07.)
ASSIGNMENT:
 Protect against mistyping a URL. 
Mistyping a Web site’s URL can land you at a fraudulent 
site, but Chrome has an autocorrect feature that matches 
URLs to a list of valid sites.
Open Chrome and select Settings. From the Settings 
menu, scroll down and select the link “Show advanced 
settings.” In the Privacy section, make sure there are 
checks in the boxes for the following:

ICT core Industries
Companies such as IBM and Sperry Rand launched the computer indus-
try when they brought the first mainframes to market in the 1960s. As the 
function of these machines expanded beyond number crunching to data 
storage and decision support, the IT (Information Technology) industry 
evolved. In the 21st century, the importance of accessing data over the 
Internet and other communications links instigated a convergence between 
the IT industry and the telecommunications industry. The result: today’s 
ICT industry.
	What is the ICT industry? Companies and businesses create 
jobs, develop products, and offer services that drive the economy. These 
companies are classified into economic sectors according to the types 
of goods and services they provide. The largest economic sectors include 
retail, health care, manufacturing, and information. 
The information industry has three major facets: content, computers, 
and telecommunications. Information content includes books, magazines, 
newspapers, sound recordings, television and radio broadcasts, motion 
pictures, user-generated media, Web content, and other data. The 
technology used to generate, manipulate, and view this data includes 
equipment such as computers and peripheral devices. The infrastructure 
and services used to distribute content are handled by telecommunications 
technology. 
The focus of Unit 8 is the ICT industry, which is made up of businesses 
that focus on digital equipment, software, communications technologies, 
and related services. This industry creates and maintains the devices and 
infrastructure used to create content, store it, move it, manipulate it, and 
display it. Figure 8-1 lists the core components of the ICT industry. Do 
you recognize the logos for prominent companies in each of the core ICT 
industry components?
Terminology
ICT and IT are sometimes 
used interchangeably when 
referring to the technology 
sector. IT tends to be used more 
frequently in the United States, 
whereas ICT tends to be used 
internationally.

SECTION A, Unit 8
What is the size of the ICT industry? ICT is one of the world’s largest 
economic sectors. It is several times larger than the aerospace and defense 
industry. Its revenues exceed those of the oil and gas industry and the 
world’s airlines. 
Worldwide, the ICT industry directly employs about 4% of the total workforce 
in jobs such as computer manufacturing, programming, and data security. 
In the U.S. alone, there are more than 100,000 software and ICT service 
companies, which employ more than 2 million skilled workers. 
In addition to jobs within the ICT industry, a broader group of careers require 
ICT skills. About 20% of the total worldwide workforce uses digital devices in 
the workplace. In developed countries, that number is higher. According to 
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 50% of today’s jobs require 
some degree of technology skill, and that percentage may increase to more 
than 70% by 2020. 
Global spending on ICT products and services was approximately $3.8 
trillion in 2015, according to Gartner, Inc. The graph in Figure 8-2 shows 
that telecommunications services produced the most revenue, reflecting the 
expanding use of wireless communications and the continuing need to build 
out Internet infrastructure. 
Figure 8-2: Revenue from core ICT Industry activities
Is the ICT industry growing? The IT industry has been described as the 
most dynamic, most prosperous, and most economically beneficial industry 
the world has ever known. That statement might be a slight exaggeration, 
but the IT industry unquestionably has fueled the economies of many 
countries. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD), between 2000 and 2012, for example, world exports 
of manufactured ICT goods grew by 65% to $1.5 trillion, with China as the 
top exporter (about $500 billion), followed by the U.S. ($150 billion).
The ICT industry has a generally upward trend, but it is affected by factors 
such as investor confidence and by trends in the broader economy. The 
2009 global recession took its toll on the ICT industry as businesses reduced 
spending. On the positive side, the ICT industry was not as deeply affected 
as some sectors of the economy, such as automobile manufacturing and 
real estate.

The 2009 recession was not the first downturn for the ICT industry. A dot-
com bubble that began in the late 1990s burst in 1999 with devastating 
effects on ICT stock values. A stock market bubble refers to a sharp rise in 
stock values that is later followed by a sudden decline. 
The so-called “dot-com bubble” was fueled by a frenzy of online business 
startups called dot-coms. Entrepreneurs seemed certain that any Internet-
based business was destined for success. Investors believed that dot-coms 
were the key to quick profits. Stocks sold like hotcakes on the technology-
specialized NASDAQ stock exchange.
Dot-com stock values soared as investors poured money into online 
businesses. Unfortunately, many dot-coms lacked experienced 
management teams, failed to develop realistic business plans, burned 
through startup capital without making a profit, and then went bankrupt. 
The high rate of dot-com business failures during 2001 and 2002 was a 
tough jolt of reality for many stockholders. It also affected a wide swath of 
the economy. The end of the dot-com bubble meant a temporary decline in 
equipment orders, Web site hosting contracts, and IT sector job openings. 
The technology sector eventually recovered from the dot-com fiasco. 
Figure 8-3 shows the two major declines in ICT stock values and traces the 
trajectory of the sector’s recovery.

SECTION A, Unit 8
ICT Goods and Services
A computer for $250? In 1969, that price would be unimaginable. Somehow, 
technology prices just keep falling, making ICT goods and services 
increasingly affordable to consumers in all economic brackets.
Are digital items, such as software, considered goods or 
services? In economics, goods are things that can be used or consumed, 
whereas services are intangible actions performed for a consumer. Goods 
can be physical objects or digital intangibles. The ICT industry produces a 
variety of goods, such as computers, smartphones, software, circuit boards, 
integrated circuits, and industrial 3-D printers. Most economists regard 
goods and services as a continuum, with intangible goods, such as software, 
in the middle of the continuum (Figure 8-4).
Who are the customers for ICT products? ICT goods and services 
can be distributed locally, nationally, or internationally. They are purchased 
by individual consumers and by corporations. Consumer goods are 
items such as laptops, music downloads, productivity software, and flash 
drives that are purchased and used by individuals. Capital goods are raw 
materials, tools, and machinery used by businesses to make consumer 
goods. 
The ICT industry produces both consumer goods and capital goods, and 
it offers services such as technical support, Web site hosting, Internet 
connections, and information access. Consumers might not pay much 
attention to capital goods that are used to produce digital devices, but circuit 
boards, chips, and fabrication machinery are a hugely profitable segment of 
the ICT industry.
The Internet has expanded the market for physical and digital ICT products, 
as it has also expanded the markets for apparel, books, sports equipment, 
and products in other industries. Consumers and businesses can shop at 
ecommerce sites to purchase all types of goods and services from local 
merchants or from businesses located on the other side of the globe.
For many countries, imports and exports account for a high percentage 
of ICT revenues. Countries that export the largest volume of ICT products 
include China, the United States, South Korea, Germany, Japan, and 
Mexico. Surprisingly, China, the United States, Japan, and Germany are 
also top ICT importers.
India and Ireland are two of the world’s largest exporters of ICT services. 
The U.S. trails behind in a distant third place. Ireland is home to the 
European data centers for Google, Yahoo, IBM, Microsoft, and Adobe. India 
is known for its outsourcing and offshoring services.

What are the advantages of outsourcing and offshoring? The 
terms outsourcing and offshoring are often used interchangeably, but they 
are slightly different. Outsourcing is the use of components or labor from 
outside suppliers. Those suppliers could be nearby or remote. Offshoring 
relocates business processes, such as development, manufacturing, and 
customer support, to lower-cost locations in other countries. 
Outsourcing enables businesses to obtain expertise, manufacturing capa-
bility, and labor without the financial outlay required to bring those resources 
in house. When Dell obtains microprocessors from Intel, it doesn’t have to 
have its own team of chip designers and chip fabrication facilities.
Offshoring reduces the cost of goods and services by using workers and 
manufacturing facilities in countries with inexpensive labor. For example, 
Apple uses offshoring to cost-effectively manufacture products at Foxconn’s 
1.16-square-mile facility in Longhua, China.
New ICT product development evolves through several phases, each requir-
ing a set of skilled workers and high-tech facilities. In 1990, most new ICT 
product development took place in the United States at large companies, 
such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Apple. Parallel development also took 
place in Japan at companies such as Sony, Epson, and Panasonic. By 
2000, U.S. companies had outsourced all but the design process to Taiwan. 
Another shift took place in 2006, when mass production shifted to China 
(Figure 8-5).
Until the 1990s, ICT companies performed all phases of product development 
in house. Prototyping and mass production moved to Taiwan, then to China. 
Outsourcing and manufacturing efficiencies contributed to falling prices of ICT 
goods and services.

SECTION A, Unit 8
What accounts for declining ICT prices? While the prices of food, 
education, and health care continue to skyrocket, the prices of ICT products, 
which require massive investment in research and development, continue 
to fall. According to a 2014 OECD report, from 2008 to 2013, the cost of 
fixed telephone service remained stable, while the price of mobile services 
decreased by about 6%. Globally, the price of fixed broadband decreased 
during this period by an astounding 70%. Whereas the average price of a 
computer in 1995 was $1,800, today consumers pay an average of $600 
for a device that is far more powerful. Figure 8-6 compares the features and 
prices of the average computer in 1995 and 2015.
Factors that contribute to the declining cost of digital goods and services 
include strategies such as outsourcing and offshoring that reduce labor 
costs. Competition plays a part, too, as companies attempt to undercut their 
rivals by offering lower prices. Technological innovation is also an important 
factor in controlling the production costs of ICT products. Economists and 
technology experts often point to Moore’s law to explain falling ICT prices.
What is Moore’s law? In 1965, Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel 
Corporation, predicted that technological innovation would double the 
number of transistors in an integrated circuit every two years without raising 
its cost. This idea become known as Moore’s law.
Increasing the number of transistors boosts processing power and makes 
it possible to build more sophisticated devices without raising costs. As 
integrated circuits grew in sophistication, fewer of them were required. 
Where once banks of RAM chips were required to supply four gigabytes of 
memory, today one low-cost chip will suffice. Not only is the cost of chips 
reduced, but with fewer chips required, the overhead to assemble a device 
decreases.
Amazingly, Moore’s law accurately described the rate of chip innovation for 
50 years. Intel hopes to continue this rate of innovation, but industry experts 
are skeptical. Several technical and economic factors point to the end of 
Moore’s law and the culture of “faster and cheaper.” However, for consumers 
who are chiefly interested in watching YouTube videos, and for innovators 
who are developing low-capacity chips for the Internet of Things, the death 
of Moore’s law and a leveling off of ICT prices might not be a concern. 
At some point, the price of goods will reach a hard bottom. Many digital 
devices may be near that point now. It is unlikely that $20 smartphones are 
on the horizon, but with technology, the future can be surprising.

Technology Life cycles
Understanding technology life cycles is useful, whether you are purchasing 
digital products and services, investing in a technology company, or prepar-
ing for a career in the ICT industry. Let’s take a look at three technology life 
cycles that affect consumers: the product life cycle, Rogers’ bell curve, and 
the Gartner Hype Cycle.
What is the digital product life cycle? From the perspective of a 
business that creates and sells a technology product, the product life cycle 
(PLC) maps the expected profitability of a product from its inception to its

In emerging nations, about 
32% of consumers have 
Internet access, indicating 
that this technology is in the 
______________ phase of 
Rogers’ bell curve.
a.	 Innovators 
b.	 Early Adopters
c.	 Early Majority
d.	 Late Majority
The percentage of consumers who participate in each phase of Rogers’ bell 
curve indicates how much a product has spread. For example, at the end of 
the Early Adopters phase, about 16% of consumers have obtained the product.
What is Rogers’ bell curve? A team of sociologists including Everett 
M. Rogers developed a model to explain how products diffuse through the 
marketplace and the way in which such diffusion affects commodity prices. 
This model, called Rogers’ bell curve, is frequently used to describe 
patterns in the way consumers adopt technology products. 
Rogers’ bell curve shows that a small group of innovators initially experiment 
with a product, which then is picked up by early adopters before spreading 
to a majority of the population. The price of products begins to decline in the 
Late Majority phase. Later, laggards adopt the product, and eventually the 
product is no longer of interest to consumers. (Figure 8-8).

THE ICT INDUSTRY

Disruptive Technology
The ICT industry produces products that are used in education, finance, 
manufacturing, health care, and just about every sector of the economy. 
These products improve people’s lives and pave the way for new enter-
prises, but they can disrupt entire industries and put people out of work.
How does technology become a disruptive influence? Disruptive 
technology displaces an existing business process, market, industry, or 
product. According to Harvard business professor Clayton Christensen, 
disruptive technologies overthrow established industries by introducing 
innovations that are simpler and less costly, though these new systems 
might not initially be as good as the old ones.
Examples of disruptive technologies are numerous. Their effects have 
an impact at many levels. They affect the people who use the original 
technology, the businesses that provide the original technology, the workers 
who make the original technology, and the entire support network associated 
with the original technology. Think about the disruptive technologies in 
Figure 8-10 and the scope of entities that they affect.
Are disruptive technologies good or bad? New technologies are 
beneficial for businesses when they produce cost savings, improve service, 
save time, and increase productivity. They may also benefit national 
economies when they stimulate spending on new products.
Disruptive technologies often have negative effects, however. Employees 
in legacy businesses may be displaced. Workers may not have skills 
needed to use new technologies; they may become irrelevant to automated 
processes; or they may lose their jobs if their employer is put out of business 
by disruptive technology.
Disruptive technologies can also prove to be detrimental if they sweep 
away effective legacy processes and business practices and replace them 
with substitute processes that turn out to be unsustainable. When profit-
able businesses are displaced by businesses with no clear financial model, 
an entire sector of the economy can suffer. Free Internet-based services, 
for example, could displace profit-earning businesses only to later fail and 
leave consumers without any services whatsoever.

rupted by television, which in turn has 
been disrupted by download and stream-
ing technology.
The telegraph was disrupted by the tele-
phone system, long distance by VoIP, and 
land line service by cellular service.
Smartphones have the potential to 
replace devices such as MP3 players, 
portable game consoles, point-and-
shoot cameras, personal video players,

ICT and Productivity
In theory, ICT products increase productivity, which in turn leads to economic 
growth and a better standard of living. If this theory is true, ICT products 
become a key technology for improving the general welfare of people in 
developed countries and emerging nations.
What is the importance of productivity? In the context of economics, 
productivity is a measurement of the amount of output that is produced per 
unit of input. For example, the productivity of a computer game programmer 
is the number of lines of code (output) that the programmer can write in a 
day (unit of input).
Many businesses have found that technology and computerization can 
significantly increase productivity. As an example, consider telephone 
service. In 1970, approximately 400,000 switchboard operators manually 
handled more than 9 billion long-distance calls. Operator productivity was 
64 calls per day. Thirty years later, new switching technology made long-
distance calling less labor intensive. Only 150,000 operators were needed 
to handle more than 100 billion calls. Productivity rose to 1,861 calls per day, 
which increased efficiency 30 times over. 
Globally, how widespread is the use of ICT? Societies benefit from 
ICT technology only to the extent that it is available and used by individuals 
and businesses. To measure and track ICT use, the United Nations 
Statistical Commission uses a set of core ICT indicators, which include cell 
phone subscriptions, Internet users, fixed telephone subscriptions, mobile-
broadband subscriptions, and fixed broadband subscriptions. Between 2001 
and 2014, significant gains were made in global ICT use, with the highest 
gains in cell phone subscriptions (Figure 8-11).

of a little less than 1%
c.	 An increase of 600 million

d.	 None
Figure 8-13: ICT Use across the globe
Can ICT technology improve the economies of emerging 
nations? Economists use indicators, such as GDP, to measure the total 
output of a nation. GDP (gross domestic product) is the monetary value of 
all the goods and services produced by a nation’s workforce on an annual 
basis. GDP is one of the primary indicators used to gauge the strength of 
a nation’s economy. When a nation’s GDP increases from year to year, its 
economy is improving. Decreases in GDP indicate a declining economy.
Between 2011 and 2013, a Strategy& study reported that digitization 
boosted world economic output by US$193 billion and created 6 million jobs 
during that period. The study also suggests that an increase of 10% in a 
country’s adoption of digital technologies fuels a 0.75% growth in its GDP 
per capita and a 1.02% drop in a nation’s unemployment rate. These factors 
are a compelling argument for national investment in digital technologies.
The World Economic Forum produces an annual report on the global 
influence of the products and services produced by the ICT industry and 
identifies how well countries leverage ICT technologies (Figure 8-13).

SECTION A, Unit 8
ICT and National Security
In the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union faced off in what was 
called the Cold War. No shots were fired, but the two rival nations engaged 
in an extensive program of surveillance, espionage, and sabotage. Today, 
nations and non-state insurgents carry out these kinds of activities using 
cyberwarfare hacking tools, and the ICT industry now plays a major role in 
national security for countries throughout the world. 
What are technology-based national security dangers? 
Computers control industrial devices. They store sensitive corporate, 
government, and military data. They process banking records and 
commercial transactions. They track and monitor people and objects. All of 
these systems can be disabled by malware or infiltrated by intrusions. And to 
compound the danger, most of these systems are connected to the Internet, 
which makes remote infiltration relatively easy.
Infiltrating and disabling one or more of these important systems could create 
chaos and temporarily weaken military defenses. Targets that particularly 
worry security officials are listed in Figure 8-14.

What role does the ICT industry play in national security? In 
addition to digital devices, the ICT industry provides many services that 
affect national security. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security identifies 
six national security functions supplied by the ICT sector (Figure 8-15).

How likely is cyberwarfare? Cyberwarfare is the use of ICT technol-
ogy to carry out politically motivated attacks designed to infiltrate, sabotage, 
or damage an opponent’s information systems and defensive capabilities. 
The evidence of cyberwarfare escalation is becoming all too obvious. Recent 
examples include the Stuxnet virus that disabled Iranian nuclear centri-
fuges, the CD-borne malware that spread throughout U.S. military networks, 
Internet outages during protests against Egypt’s government, a three-week 
siege against Estonian banking systems, and mysterious Internet outages 
that seem to originate from Chinese and North Korean DNS exploits.
Cyberwars begin unannounced. There is no declaration of war. Instead, 
cyber soldiers carry out a few online attacks to test the enemy’s defenses. 
Although cyberwar attacks are not currently making the daily headlines, 
plenty of activity is taking place behind the scenes as hackers hone their 
cyberwarfare tools and as stakeholders in the public and private sectors 
assess their cybersecurity risks.
National governments both large and small are acutely aware of cyber 
threats. Most have cyber security teams in place to monitor and respond to 
activities that threaten the ICT sector. In the United States, the Department 
of Homeland Security operates US-CERT, the United States Computer 
Emergency Readiness Team. Its mission is to “improve the nation’s cyber-
security posture, coordinate cyber information sharing, and proactively 
manage cyber risks to the Nation while protecting the constitutional rights 
of Americans.” 
Internationally, the Tallinn Manual is a non-binding document that is the 
cyber equivalent of the Geneva Convention. Based on existing laws govern-
ing international conflict, the Tallinn Manual sets out rules for conducting 
and responding to cyberwarfare.

manual calculators
The origin of the computer industry traces far back to ancient times when 
simple calculators were used by merchants, engineers, and tax collectors. 
At inception, the computer industry was all about numbers. The notion that 
computers could also be used to manipulate text, images, and sound was a 
relatively late development in the timeline of events. 
	What came before computers? Even before recorded history, 
humans used counting aids, such as pebbles and notched sticks, to keep 
track of quantities—the number of sheep in a flock, for example, or the 
number of oil jars purchased from a merchant. Many transactions, how-
ever, required calculations. 
A calculation is based on an algorithm—the step-by-step process by which 
numbers are manipulated. Even simple paper-and-pencil addition requires 
an algorithm. The steps include adding the rightmost digits first, carrying 
a 1 if necessary, and then moving left to any remaining digits, where the 
process is repeated. A manual calculator is a device that assists in the 
process of numeric calculations but requires the human operator to keep 
track of the algorithm.
A manual calculator called an abacus was used in ancient Rome, Greece, 
India, China, and Japan. Only as the last century came to a close was the 
abacus replaced by handheld digital calculators. In a 1946 contest between 
a Japanese abacus expert and an American accountant using an adding 
machine, the abacus expert won! The same outcome is unlikely with today’s 
technology, but abacus use is still taught to millions of children around the 
world as a foundation for basic numeracy. 
An abacus, like the one in Figure 8-16, consists of beads mounted on rods 
within a rectangular frame. Each bead represents a quantity—1, 5, 10, 50, 
and so on. To use an abacus, you must learn the algorithm for manipulating 
the beads.
Each of these beads 
­represents the quantity “5.”
Each of these 
beads represents 
the quantity “10.”
Each of these 
beads represents 
the quantity “1.”

An abacus uses beads to represent numbers. This abacus shows the num-
ber 17. Using an algorithm, the beads on an abacus can be manipulated to 
perform arithmetic operations.

SECTION B, Unit 8
mechanical calculators
Manual calculators require the operator to apply algorithms to perform 
­calculations. In contrast, a mechanical calculator implements algorithms 
­autonomously. With a mechanical calculator the operator simply enters the 
numbers for a calculation, and then pulls a lever or turns a wheel to carry out 
the calculation. No thinking—or at least very ­little—is required.
	When did machines begin to perform calculations? Mechanical 
calculators were developed as early as 1623. Schickard’s Calculator 
had a series of interlocking gears. Each of the ten spokes on a gear 
­represented a digit. Every time a gear completed a full circle, it moved the 
next gear one notch to the left to “carry the 1.” A similar mechanism is used 
to advance the mileage on the odometers of vintage cars. 
In 1642, a Frenchman named Blaise Pascal developed the Pascaline, a 
mechanical device that could be used to perform basic arithmetic. It was not 
until 1820, however, that Thomas de Colmar’s Arithmometer became the 
first mass-produced ­mechanical calculator. 
	Did mechanical calculators require human power? Between 
1822 and 1833, as the Victorian Age was about to begin, an English mathe-
matician named Charles Babbage drew plans for several calculating devices 
driven by steam power, which was cutting-edge technology during that time 
period. 
Babbage might be considered the great-grandfather of steampunk. He 
called his devices “engines,” and their hulking design—eleven feet long and 
seven feet high—called for thousands of precision-engineered levers, gears, 
and wheels. Babbage’s Analytical Engine was an all-purpose computing 
device. Computer historians believe that its design embodies many of the 
concepts that define modern computers, including memory, a programmable 
processor, an output device, and user-definable input of programs and data. 
Unfortunately for Babbage, he was unable to marshal financial and engineer-
ing resources to complete any of his engines. He did manage to construct a 
small prototype (Figure 8-17), but it was not until 1991 that a working engine 
based on his prototype was completed by the London Science Museum to 
commemorate the bicentennial year of Babbage’s birth.

	When did calculators become electronic? A world in which cal-
culators and computers operate on steam power is the subject of several 
intriguing alternate-reality sci-fi books, but obviously technology did not 
evolve in that direction—thanks to the U.S. Census Bureau and a man 
named Herman Hollerith.
The process of compiling data from the 1880 census dragged on until 
1887—just three years before the next census was to begin. With a surge 
in population, Census Bureau administrators feared that the 1890 census 
could not be completed before the 1900 census would begin. Clearly, a 
faster method of tabulating census results was required. 
The U.S. Census Bureau held a competition to find a way to tabulate the 
1890 census. Herman Hollerith won the competition with a design for an 
electronic punched card tabulating device (Figure 8-18). 
	How did Hollerith’s tabulator work? Hollerith’s device used 
cards with designated areas representing data fields, such as “nationality.” 
Once punched, the cards were fed into a card reader that used an array of 
metal rods to electronically read data from the cards, tabulate the results, 
and display them on a series of dials. 
The Hollerith Tabulating Machine was effective. The 1890 census was tal-
lied in six months, and only two additional years were required to complete 
all statistical ­calculations. Hollerith incorporated the Tabulating Machine 
Company in 1896. In 1924, the name of the company was changed to 
International Business Machines, better known today as IBM.
	Was this the beginning of the computer industry? Not yet. IBM 
first gained prominence in the business machine industry, which predated 
the computer industry by about 50 years. In addition to IBM, the business 
machine industry included contenders such as Burroughs, National Cash 
Register (NCR), and Remington. These companies mass-produced type-
writers and calculating machines—sometimes called tabulators. Between 
1930 and 1960, use of these machines became widespread in businesses, 
corporations, and government agencies. Business machines were in high 
demand because they introduced efficiencies and increased productivity. 
Computer technology later caused major disruption to the business machine 
industry. Though several of the biggest business machine firms attempted to 
evolve with emerging digital technologies, IBM was one of the few compa-
nies that successfully managed the transition.

computer prototypes
The question “Who invented the computer?” doesn’t have a simple 
answer because modern digital computers evolved from prototypes 
developed between 1936 and 1946 by various individuals and research 
teams. Computer prototypes popped up in surprising places, beginning 
with a device called the ABC. 
	What’s the story behind the ABC? Iowa seems like an odd birth-
place for the computer. But in 1936, Iowa State College professor John V. 
Atanasoff began to seriously consider how to construct a digital device that 
would produce more accurate calculations than available analog devices. 
One night, after a long drive past endless Iowa cornfields, professor 
Atanasoff stopped at a roadside tavern. While sipping a drink, he scribbled 
the basic plan for a digital computer on a cocktail napkin. 
In the ensuing months, Atanasoff and a graduate student, Clifford E. Berry, 
created the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC). It was the first computing 
device to use vacuum tubes instead of mechanical switches as processing 
circuitry. Its design also incorporated the idea of basing calculations on the 
binary number system. 
The ABC, shown in Figure 8-19, is often considered the first electronic 
digital computer. According to physicist Allan Mackintosh, the ABC may not 
have been much of a computer, just as the Wrights’ model was not much of 
an airplane, but it demonstrated the feasibility of digital computing.
	Did the ABC become the basis for modern computers? Not 
exactly. The work of Atanasoff and Berry was largely ignored. In Germany, 
a similar fate awaited the work of Konrad Zuse, who developed a computer 
called the Z3. Like the ABC, Zuse’s device used vacuum tubes and was 
designed to work with binary numbers. Built in Nazi Germany during World 
War II, the Z3 was cloaked in secrecy, even though Hitler believed that com-
puters had no strategic use in the war effort. Information on Zuse’s invention 
did not surface until long after the war ended. So although Zuse was on the 
trail of modern computer architecture, his work had little effect on the devel-
opment of computers in other areas of the world.
Even with the work of Atanasoff, Berry, and Zuse, it was not clear that 
computers were destined to be binary electronic devices. IBM pursued an 
entirely different computer architecture by sponsoring an engineer named 
Howard Aiken, who embarked on an audacious plan to integrate 73 IBM 
Automatic Accounting Machines into a single unified computing unit.

	Did Aiken succeed? The collaboration between Aiken and IBM pro-
duced a mechanical computer officially named the IBM Automatic Sequence 
Controlled Calculator, but now usually referred to as the Harvard Mark I 
because it was moved to Harvard University shortly after completion. 
The Harvard Mark I strayed considerably from the path of development 
leading to modern computers. The device was digital but used decimal 
rather than binary representation, which is used by today’s computers. 
Constructed of relay switches, rotating shafts, and clutches, the Harvard 
Mark I sounded like a “roomful of ladies knitting,” according to physicist 
Jeremy Bernstein. The device was 51 feet long and 8 feet tall and weighed 
about 5 tons (Figure 8-20).

	Were prototypes able to perform any real computing? Some 
computer ­prototypes were pressed into service barely before they were 
completed. In 1943, a team of British engineers created Colossus, an elec-
tronic device designed to decode messages that were sent between the 
German High Command and their field commanders. 
Colossus ­contained 1,800 vacuum tubes, used binary arithmetic, and was 
capable of reading input at the rate of 5,000 characters per second. It was 
a programmable device and has the distinction of being the world’s first 
electronic digital programmable computer. The British manufactured ten 
Colossus machines during World War II, but their existence was a tightly 
kept secret. 
When the war ended, Winston Churchill directed that all equipment and 
documentation about Colossus machines be destroyed. Only in 1976 was 
the veil of secrecy lifted, allowing Colossus designers and programmers 
to discuss their work. Unfortunately, the long period of secrecy prevented 
Colossus technology from making a significant contribution to developments 
in the post-war computer industry.

	Did the United States use computers during World War II? 
In 1943, a team headed by John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert started 
work on ENIAC, a general-purpose electronic computer. ENIAC (Electronic 
Numerical Integrator and Computer) was designed to calculate trajectory 
tables for the U.S. Army, but it wasn’t finished until November 1945—three 
months after World War II ended. 
ENIAC was over 100 feet long and 10 feet high and weighed 30 tons! This 
gigantic machine contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes and consumed 
174,000 watts of power. ENIAC was programmed by manually connect-
ing cables and setting 6,000 switches—a process that generally took two 
days to complete. It could perform 5,000 additions per second, which was 
astonishingly fast at the time, but seems pitifully slow compared to today’s 
personal computers that easily perform more than 2 billion additions per 
second. 
ENIAC’s memory held both programs and data. This feature became 
known as von Neumann architecture after the mathematician, John von 
Neumann, who first described it. Unit 2 explained how memory in modern 
computing devices works, and you know that program instructions and data 
are all loaded into the same memory space. That concept dates back to the 
1940s and ENIAC’s von Neumann architecture.
ENIAC was formally dedicated at the University of Pennsylvania Moore 
School of Electrical Engineering on February 15, 1946, and it was imme-
diately pressed into service making atomic energy calculations and 
computing trajectories for new missile ­technologies (Figure 8-21). ENIAC 
received several upgrades and remained in service until 1955.
Figure 8-21: ENIAC 
ENIAC’s first programmers were a team of six women. Two of these women, 
Jean Jennings and Frances Bilas, are shown in this photo from 1946 at the 
Moore School of Electrical Engineering.

commercial computers
After World War II, companies such as IBM, Remington Rand, and Sperry 
refocused on the business sector. They were successful in transforming the 
market for calculators into a dynamic computer industry. This transforma-
tion took place in four phases, now referred to as the four generations of 
computers. 
	What was the first commercially successful computer? A 
computer called UNIVAC is considered by most historians to be the first 
commercially successful digital computer. The first UNIVAC computer was 
constructed under the auspices of the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corp., a 
company hastily cobbled together by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert. 
This event marks the birth of the computer industry.
Eckert and Mauchly completed the first UNIVAC in 1951, but their company 
was in financial distress. The company, along with the UNIVAC schemat-
ics, was acquired by Remington Rand, one of IBM’s chief rivals in the 
business machine industry. Forty-six UNIVAC computers were delivered to 
Remington Rand’s customers between 1951 and 1958.
At 14.5 feet long, 7.5 feet high, and 9 feet wide, UNIVAC was physically 
smaller than ENIAC, but more powerful. UNIVAC could read data at the rate 
of 7,200 characters per second and complete 2.25 million instruction cycles 
per second (Figure 8-22). 
	How did computers progress from room-sized behemoths to 
modern personal computers? Early computers, such as the Harvard 
Mark I, ENIAC, and UNIVAC, used technology that required lots of space 
and electrical power. As technology evolved, relay switches and vacuum 
tubes were replaced with smaller, less power-hungry components. Most 
computer historians agree that computers have evolved through four distinct 
generations. In each generation, computers became smaller, faster, more 
dependable, and less expensive to operate.
The American public first saw a computer in action during 
the 1952 presidential election. CBS reporters Walter Cronkite 
and Charles Collingwood could not believe UNIVAC’s predic-
tion. The election was supposed to be close. But based on 
only 3 million votes, the computer correctly predicted that 
Eisenhower would win. 
QuickCheck
Why is UNIVAC considered the 
first commercial computer?
a.	 It was actually sold to 
businesses.
b.	 It correctly predicted 
the winner of the 1952 
presidential election.
c.	 It required no coding.
d.	 It was funded by a 
government contract that 
was repaid.

SECTION B, Unit 8
	What characterized the first generation of computers? 
First-generation computers, such as UNIVAC, can be characterized by 
their use of vacuum tubes to store individual bits of data. A ­vacuum tube is 
an electronic device that controls the flow of electrons in a vacuum (Figure 
8-23). Each tube can be set to one of two states. One state is assigned a 
value of 0 and the other a value of 1. 
Courtesy of vintchip.com
Vacuum tubes respond more quickly than mechanical relays, resulting in 
faster computations, but they also have several disadvantages. They con-
sume a lot of power, much of which is wasted as heat. They also tend to 
burn out quickly. 
In addition to vacuum tube technology, first-generation computers were 
characterized by custom application programs made to order for the specific 
task the computer was to perform. Programming first-generation comput-
ers was difficult. As the computer era dawned, programmers were forced to 
think in 1s and 0s to write instructions in machine language. 
Before the first generation ended, programmers had devised rudimentary 
compilers that allowed them to write instructions using assembly language 
op codes, such as LDA and JNZ. Assembly language was a small step 
forward; but like machine language, it was machine specific and required 
programmers to learn a different set of instructions for each computer. 
	What about second-generation computers? Second-
generation computers used transistors instead of vacuum tubes. First 
demonstrated in 1947 by AT&T’s Bell Laboratories, 
transistors regulate current or voltage flow and 
act as a switch for electronic signals. 
Transistors performed functions similar to 
vacuum tubes, but they were much smaller, 
cheaper, less power hungry, and more reli-
able. By the late 1950s, transistors, such as 
those in Figure 8-24, had replaced vacuum 
tubes as the processing and memory tech-
nology for most computers. 
Several successful transistorized 
computers were manufactured by 
companies such as IBM, Burroughs,

Control Data Corp., Honeywell, and Sperry Rand (which was the new name 
given to Remington Rand after its merger with Sperry Corp.). These com-
puters served businesses and even played a major role in the U.S. space 
program (Figure 8-25).
In addition to the important hardware breakthrough provided by transistors, 
an equally important development in software differentiated second-gener-
ation computers from their first-generation ­ancestors.
First-generation computers didn’t have operating systems as we know them 
today. Instead, each software application included the instructions nec-
essary for every aspect of the computing job, such as input, output, and 
processing activities. 
Programmers were quick to realize that this style of programming was ter-
ribly inefficient. For example, although virtually every program sent results 
to a printer, every program was also required to have its own print routine. 
Computer manufacturers such as IBM developed operating systems that 
provided standardized routines for input, output, memory management, 
storage, and other resource management activities. 
Early operating systems were a step in the right direction; but unfortunately, 
learning to use each one was like learning a new and unique programming 
language. It was not until the third generation of computers that portable 
operating systems, such as CP/M and UNIX, provided programmers with 
similar operating system ­commands across hardware platforms.
In addition to operating systems, second-generation computers also ran 
programming language compilers that allowed programmers to write instruc-
tions using English-like commands rather than machine language 1s and 0s 
or cryptic assembly language commands. 
High-level programming languages, such as COBOL (Common Business-
Oriented Language) and Fortran (Formula Translator), were available for 
use on second-generation computers and remain in use today. The avail-
ability of high-level languages made it possible for third parties to develop 
software, and that capability was instrumental in the birth of the software 
industry.

	What are the characteristics of third-generation computers? 
Third-generation computers became possible in 1958, when Jack Kilby at 
Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor indepen-
dently developed integrated circuits (Figure 8-26). 
Reuters/Landov
Figure 8-26: The original integrated circuit
IBM offered integrated circuit technology in its wildly successful IBM 360. 
The first orders for these ­computers were filled in 1965—a date regarded by 
many historians as the beginning of third-generation computing. 
In 1965, Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC) introduced the DEC PDP-8, 
the first ­commercially successful minicomputer. Minicomputers were 
designed to be smaller and less powerful than mainframe computers, 
while maintaining the capability to simultaneously run multiple programs 
for multiple users. Thousands of manufacturing plants, small businesses, 
and scientific laboratories were attracted to the speed, small size, and 
reasonable cost of the PDP-8. 
DEC introduced a ­succession of minicomputers that stole a share of the 
mainframe market. Eventually, IBM and other mainframe makers intro-
duced their own minicomputers, but the star for minicomputers faded as a 
new technology—microcomputers—gradually gained popularity. DEC was 
­purchased by Compaq in 1998. Compaq was later purchased by Hewlett-
Packard (HP). 
	When did the fourth generation of computers emerge? The 
technology for fourth-generation computers appeared in 1971, when Ted 
Hoff developed the first general-purpose microprocessor. Called the Intel 
4004, this microprocessor ­dramatically changed the computer industry, 
resulting in fourth-generation microprocessor-based computer systems that 
were faster, smaller, and less expensive than third-generation computers.
Intel’s 4004 microprocessor 
(Figure 8-27) was smaller than 
a cornflake but matched the 
computing power of ENIAC. 
The 4004 packed the equivalent 
of 2,300 transistors or vacuum 
tubes on a single chip and was 
able to perform 60,000 instruc-
tions per second. 
Integrated circuit tech-
nology made it possible 
to pack the equivalent 
of thousands of vacuum 
tubes or transistors onto 
a single miniature chip, 
vastly reducing the physi-
cal size, weight, and power 
requirements for devices 
such as computers.

As the fourth generation of computers emerged, microprocessor manufac-
turers soon flourished. Early industry leaders included Intel, Zilog, Motorola, 
and Texas Instruments. Today, microprocessors are a key component of 
all types of computers—ranging from smartphones to supercomputers. 
Intel reigns as the world’s leading microprocessor manufacturer, although 
microprocessors are also produced by companies such as Hitachi, Texas 
Instruments, Toshiba, AMD, and Motorola.
personal computers
The 1980s were a decade of big hair, leg warmers, and boom boxes. Ferris 
Bueller took his famous day off, and a DeLorean time machine starred in 
Back to the Future. The computer industry was changing its future, too, 
by transitioning into an information technology industry whose core busi-
ness included data in addition to hardware. During this period, the industry 
shifted from the East Coast to the West Coast and began to focus on a vast 
new market: consumers. The era of personal computers was beginning. 
	Who invented the personal computer? In the early 1970s, many 
hobbyists built their own computer systems based on integrated circuit 
and microprocessor technologies. One such system, the Mark-8, was 
developed by Jonathan A. Titus and featured in the July 1974 issue of 
Radio-Electronics. These early personal computers were not commercially 
produced or widely available, but they are often considered forerunners of 
today’s personal ­computer.
In 1975, Ed Roberts and the MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry 
Systems) company announced the MITS Altair, which many historians 
believe to be the first commercial microcomputer. 
The Altair was based on the Intel 8080 processor and sold as a kit for 
$395 or fully assembled for $650—about one-fourth the price of a 1975 
Volkswagen Beetle. The Altair was a computer for the hobbyist. The kit 
came unassembled in a box containing a processor and 256 bytes of mem-
ory—not 256 KB, just 256 bytes. It had no keyboard, no monitor, and no 
permanent storage device (Figure 8-28). 
	What were the first personal computers? In 1976, Steve Jobs 
and Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computer Co., and released the Apple I, 
a kit ­containing a system board with 4 KB of RAM that sold for $666.66. 
Other companies, such as Commodore, Atari, and RadioShack, also pur-
sued the hobbyist market, but with preassembled computers.

1981 and evolved into today’s

In 1978, Apple introduced a preassembled computer called the Apple II, 
which ­featured color graphics, expansion slots, a disk drive, a 1.07 MHz 
6502 processor, and 16 KB of RAM for $1,195. The Apple II, shown in Figure 
8-29, was the first desktop computer superstar. One of the main reasons 
behind its success was a commercial software ­program called VisiCalc—
the first electronic spreadsheet. This program landed computers on the 
radar screen of ­business users and clearly marked a turning point where 
personal computers began to appeal to an audience beyond ­hobbyists.
	When did the IBM PC hit store shelves? In 1981, IBM began 
marketing what it called a personal computer or PC, based on the 8088 
processor. When the PC version of VisiCalc became available, the IBM PC 
quickly became the top-selling personal ­computer, far surpassing IBM’s 
expectations. 
The $3,000 IBM PC, shown in Figure 8-29, shipped with a 4.77 MHz Intel 
8088 processor, 16 KB of RAM, and single-sided 160 KB floppy disk drives. 
The IBM PC was soon followed by the IBM PC XT, which featured RAM 
upgradable to 640 KB and a 10 MB hard disk drive. 
IBM PCs were constructed with off-the-shelf parts that could be easily 
obtained from many electronics wholesalers. Within months, dozens of com-
panies used these parts to produce clones of IBM-compatible computers 
that could run the same software and use the same expansion cards as the 
IBM PC and PC XT. These companies were also able to obtain essentially 
the same operating system used by IBM. The operating system was called 
PC-DOS and it was marketed by a young entrepreneur named Bill Gates, 
founder of a fledgling software company called Microsoft. 
	How did personal computers become so successful? Although 
hobbyists and the business community had embraced computers, these 
machines were still considered difficult for the average person to use. That 
perception began to change in 1983, when Apple introduced a product 
called the Apple Lisa. A key feature of the Lisa was its graphical user inter-
face—an idea borrowed from the Xerox Alto computer. 
At $10,000, the Lisa proved too expensive for most consumers. Apple 
remained committed to graphical user interfaces, however, and in 1984 
released the first Apple Macintosh. The $2,495 Macintosh featured a 
graphical user interface that made programs easier to use than those on 
the command line–based IBM PC. The Macintosh became the computer of 
choice for graphical applications such as desktop publishing.
By the late 1980s, the computer industry had begun to consolidate around 
two primary platforms—the MS-DOS–based IBM-compatible platform and 
the Apple Macintosh. By the mid-1990s, IBM-compatible computer systems 
accounted for more than 90% of all personal computer sales. The Apple 
Macintosh accounted for most of the remainder, with other proprietary plat-
forms accounting for a very small percentage of new computer sales.
	How have personal computers evolved? Desktop computers had 
their day. Although they are still available, the trend now is toward portable 
digital devices. 
The first portable computers appeared in the early 1970s, but they were the 
size of a carry-on bag and weighed just as much! Throughout the 1980s 
and 1990s, portable computers became smaller, lighter, and more popular 
until sometime around 2005, when they outsold desktop computers.

a full-color graphical user interface, a touchscreen, a 412 MHz processor, 
4 GB of RAM, a built-in camera, and easy-to-use apps, the iPhone offered 
features undreamed of when computers first became portable. A computer 
industry milestone occurred in 2011 when, for the first time, smartphones 
outsold desktop and laptop computers. 
Apple set another hardware milestone when it introduced the iPad in 2010. 
Its sleek form factor enclosed a 1 GHz processor, 256 MB of RAM, 16 GB 
of storage, a full-color touchscreen, and cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity. The 
popularity of smartphones and tablet computers signals yet another phase 
of the computer industry.
	Is the computer industry still in transition? The core business of 
the computer industry is hardware and, clearly, devices are continuing to 
change. Computers originated as tools for big business and government 
agencies. Later, desktop and laptop devices were deployed in businesses, 
and the same devices were used by individuals. This trend is changing, 
however, as consumer devices and their simplified software diverge from 
the more powerful devices and full-featured software used by profession-
als (Figure 8-30).

THE telecom Industry
In ancient times, news and informa-
tion were carried along vast trade routes spread 
throughout Asia and the Middle East. The speed 
of communication was measured by the swiftness 
of messengers on foot, on horseback, or on wind-
driven sailing ships. Messages might have taken 
days, weeks, or months to reach their destinations. 
That situation changed significantly in the 19th 
century, as one telecommunications technology 
after another emerged from inventors’ workshops.

Telegraph
You may recall the epic scene in the film The Lord of the Rings: The Return 
of the King, when Pippin lights a beacon in Minas Tirith and, one by one, 
signal fires on nearby mountain tops dramatically ignite into pillars of flame. 
Such communications were historically used by nation states as warning 
signals, and they are a form of telecommunications called telegraphy.
	What is telegraphy? Telegraphy refers to transmitting text or sym-
bolic information over long distances without the use of a living carrier, such 
as a courier or a carrier pigeon. Primitive forms of optical telegraphy used in 
ancient times included smoke signals, light beacons, and signal flags. 
Flags and other visual signals were used on battlefields to help commanders 
communicate instructions to troops. These forms of telegraphic communica-
tions were limited to line-of-sight distances and were able to convey a very 
limited set of data. They became known as semaphores to differentiate 
them from a technology called the telegraph.
	Who invented the telegraph? The account of Benjamin Franklin fly-
ing a kite during a thunderstorm in 1752 represents the time period when 
scientists began to seriously study electricity. Until the concept of electricity 
was understood, semaphores and the Pony Express remained the primary 
telecommunications channels.
In the early 1800s—about the time Charles Babbage was designing his 
Analytical Engine—inventors began to experiment with electrical telegra-
phy, or what we now generally refer to as the telegraph. Francis Ronalds, 
a British inventor, built the first rudimentary telegraph in 1816 using a cable 
connected at either end to dials marked with the letters of the alphabet. It 
was a cumbersome apparatus, but it demonstrated that sending messages 
electronically at a distance was possible. 
Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber built an early prototype of a 
telegraph system that sent messages encoded as positive and negative 
currents—essentially a binary encoding system. As a two-way communica-
tion system, each node required a transmitter for sending messages and a 
receiver for collecting them.
The first commercial telegraph was co-developed by Sir William Cooke and 
Charles Wheatstone. Their device, patented in 1837, was composed of sev-
eral compass-like needles that pointed to letters of the alphabet according 
to received electrical signals (Figure 8-31).

	When was Morse code introduced? In 1837, U.S. inventor Samuel 
Morse developed and patented a telegraph system. His system transmit-
ted data using the Morse code alphabet, a binary encoding system based 
on dots and dashes. Skilled telegraph operators listened to the dots and 
dashes through a headset and transcribed them into letters of the alphabet. 
Messages were encoded using a telegraph key (Figure 8-32).
Figure 8-32: Morse code
	What was the significance of the telegraph? Author Tom 
Standage refers to the telegraph as the Victorian Internet because “it revolu-
tionized business practices, gave rise to new forms of crime, and inundated 
its users with a deluge of information. Romances blossomed over the wires. 
Secret codes were devised by some users and cracked by others...a tech-
nological subculture with its own customs and vocabulary was establishing 
itself.”
As with technologies that developed in later years, the telegraph experienced 
a cycle of invention and prototyping, followed by a peak of expectations 
like those tracked by the Gartner Hype Cycle. That peak was followed by a 
period of disillusionment when the technical going got tough and it became 
apparent that the technology would not solve all the world’s problems. 
Finally, the telegraph reached its plateau of productivity and became, for a 
time, the primary means of worldwide telecommunications.
	How did the telegraph shape world events? Thomas Edison was 
a telegraph operator when he was a teenager. He invented the stock ticker 
and went on to create many more devices that became part of mainstream 
life including the phonograph and the motion picture camera. His early ana-
log devices were the foundation for the film and recording industries that 
today provide digital audio and video content that streams over the Internet. 
The telegraph served governments and individuals alike. It carried momen-
tous dispatches as well as simple greetings. During the U.S. Civil War, for 
example, Abraham Lincoln nervously paced the floor of the War Department 
Telegraph Office throughout the day. He wanted to be in the same room as 
the telegraph apparatus when messages arrived from commanders on the 
front lines. 
By 1861, commercial telegraph lines linked major cities in the United States, 
and the Pony Express was discontinued. All the capitals of Europe were con-
nected, and news flowed over the wires in a never-ending stream. Optimists 
viewed the telegraph as a great uniting force among nations with the poten-
tial for establishing world peace.
But if the telegraph had any chance of becoming the instrument of world 
peace, it would first have to connect the continents, and that required some 
way to transmit messages across oceans. The technology used to lay trans-
oceanic cables was essential for the telegraph industry and all the other 
communications industries that followed.

	How did the telegraph span oceans? The danger of submerging 
electrical devices in water is well known. Salt water conducts electricity, 
and that means a current sent over a bare wire would disperse into the 
ocean water, diverting the signal from its destination. The success of an 
underwater cable depended on the discovery of gutta-percha, a rubber-like 
substance derived from the sap of a tree grown in Malaysia. 
A thick coat of gutta-percha was used to insulate the exterior surface of 
telegraph wires, which were then covered with a flexible mesh of protec-
tive steel. A spool of cable weighed about one ton for each nautical mile. 
In 1857, the Atlantic Telegraph Company deployed two converted warships 
on loan from the British and U.S. governments. Loaded with cables, these 
ships began the delicate process of spooling out cable and letting it sink to 
the ocean floor.
The cable broke on the first day, but it was retrieved with grappling hooks 
and repaired. A second break occurred in an area of the ocean more than a 
mile deep, and the mission was abandoned. The next year, a second expe-
dition set out. Despite several additional mishaps, the cable successfully 
connected Europe to North America. On August 16, 1858, the transatlantic 
telegraph carried its first cable. It began, “Europe and America are united 
by telegraphy...” The 70-character message took over 17 hours to transmit. 
The reception was terrible. A month later, the cable failed. 
It was not until 1866 that transatlantic telegraphy was reestablished. The 
new cable was much faster than the old one, with speeds reaching eight 
words per minute. Telegraphy remained the major technology for intercon-
tinental communication well into the 1950s, but it was then surpassed by 
telephone communications and later by the Internet. British Telecom sold 
its telegraph division in 2003. Western Union sent its final telegram in 2006. 
But before its demise, telegraph cables stretched from continent to conti-
nent, marking out the routes for digital data that would come decades later 
(Figure 8-33).

SECTION c, Unit 8
Telephone
There are some visionaries who make astoundingly accurate predictions. 
In 1878—more than 125 years before Skype and the iPhone—journalist 
Kate Field wrote, “I’ve just read of the electroscope, the province of which is 
to transmit waves of light by electricity. Combine it with the telephone, and 
while two persons, hundreds of miles apart, are talking together, they will 
actually see each other. Won’t this be fun? If your lover happens to be an 
amateur photographer, he’ll take your picture, my dear, across the ocean. 
Only let electricity circumvent the Atlantic, and I’m its slave for life.”
	How did the telephone industry get its start? A telephone is, 
very simply, a device that transmits human voices over a distance using 
cables or airborne signals. The first telephone was invented and patented by 
Alexander Graham Bell in 1876. The telephone arrived after the telegraph 
and was based on technical discoveries related to sending multiple mes-
sages along a single wire using different frequencies.
Shortly after filing his telephone patents, Bell and several investors founded 
the Bell Telephone Company, which—after a long road of many twists and 
turns—became what is now AT&T. 
	How did early telephones differ from modern phones? By 
definition, a telephone contains a microphone/transmitter and a speaker/
receiver. Early telephones were primitive devices—not much more sophis-
ticated than connecting two tin cans with a string. Like tin can phones, the 
first telephones had a transmitter and a receiver in the same port, so callers 
had to alternately shout into the port and then put it to their ear. 
Telephones evolved through several design form factors, including box 
phones, candlesticks, phones with rotary dialers, and Trimline phones with 
touchtone keypads (Figure 8-34).

	Did the telephone network use the same infrastructure 
as the telegraph network? The first telephones were connected by 
point-to-point networks, similar to those used by the telegraph system. This 
method meant that one phone was hard-wired to one destination. Speaking 
to people at several locations required a set of phones for each location. 
That scheme was clearly unworkable, so a more practical network topology 
for the telephone system soon emerged. 
Telephone networks are based on a hierarchy of interconnected stars. At 
the center of the star is a telephone exchange that manages connections 
between callers. The world’s first commercial telephone exchange opened 
on November 12, 1877, in Germany. Its manual switchboard was controlled 
by a switchboard operator (Figure 8-35).
When a subscriber cranked the handle of a box-style telephone or lifted a 
handset, the port for the subscriber’s line would light up on the operator’s 
panel. The operator plugged one end of a cable into the subscriber’s port. That 
completed a circuit to the central office, and the operator could ask for the 
number by saying “Number please?” The operator would then plug the other 
end of the patch cable into the port for the call’s destination.
	What happened to switchboard operator jobs? Automated 
exchanges, which eliminated the need for human operators, appeared as 
early as 1900. Telephones equipped with dials were able to directly inter-
act with equipment at the telephone exchange, so switchboard operators 
were no longer needed to connect patch cables for local calls. Operators 
were still required for long-distance calls, however, and a small workforce is 
employed even today to handle directory assistance—though that service, 
too, is now extensively automated. 
	What is a common carrier? A common carrier is any person or 
company that transports goods, passengers, or electronic signals over 
regular routes at set rates. Common carriers are subject to a set of gov-
ernment regulations. They are legally required to provide services as long 
as there is enough space or capacity, requisite fees are paid, and no rea-
sonable grounds exist to refuse carriage. Telegraph, telephone, and cellular 
phone services are classified as common carriers. Radio and television are 
not classified as common carriers. When this textbook went to press, the 
Internet and Internet-based data services were not considered common car-
riers, though proposals to reclassify those services were pending.

	When did the telephone system go digital? The telephone sys-
tem was initially analog. In 1976, AT&T installed the world’s first electronic 
digital switchboard, or “switch.” It handled 500,000 calls per hour. Digital 
switches digitize incoming speech using a process similar to music digitiza-
tion that you learned about in Unit 1. The digitized voice is reconstructed as 
analog sound when it arrives at the recipient’s local exchange. Although the 
switches worked with digital voice, the last mile from customer equipment 
to the switch remained analog. 
End-to-end digital telephone service is now available using VoIP protocols. 
AT&T U-verse Voice, for example, lets customers make and receive calls 
over a high-speed Internet connection using a standard telephone handset.
	How does the telephone system relate to ICT? As the era of 
commercial Internet access began in 1995, the telephone system had an 
extensive, worldwide network, including undersea cables and communica-
tions satellites for long-distance calls. The telephone system infrastructure 
became a key element of the Internet backbone and one of a few ways for 
consumers to gain Internet access. Not only was local telephone equipment 
used to dial in to local ISPs, but transcontinental lines were used to transport 
data between service providers.
Of today’s seven Tier 1 Internet service providers, more than half began as 
telephone companies. Which of the company logos in Figure 8-36 are famil-
iar to consumers today?
QuickCheck
Which statement is true about 
the telephone system’s last 
mile?
a.	 It was used for dial-up

b.	 It stretched between two or 
more local exchanges.
c.	 It was the first segment of 
the telephone network to go 
digital.
d. 	It was the main technology 
for Tier 1 Internet service 
providers.
AT&T was a Bell Telephone Company subsidiary, but it acquired its parent 
company in 1899. In 1984, U.S. regulators required AT&T to divest its sub-
sidiaries and make them separate entities, known as the Baby Bells. One of 
these subsidiaries, Southwestern Bell (SBC), eventually purchased AT&T.
Verizon traces its roots back to Bell Atlantic, one of the Baby Bells. After 
merging with GTE in 2000, the combined company was rebranded as 
Verizon.
Sprint Corporation originated as the Brown Telephone Company, 
founded in 1899. It has since done business as United Telephone and 
Electric, United Telecom, Southern Pacific Communications Company, GTE 
Sprint, and Sprint Nextel Corporation. 
CenturyLink traces its heritage to the Oak Ridge Telephone Company, 
which acquired several smaller companies and in 1999 was renamed 
CenturyTel, Inc. In 2010, the company acquired Qwest and overnight 
became the third largest telecommunications company in the United States. 
Qwest can be described as a digital native. Founded in 1996, it began by 
building an all-digital fiber-optic network along the Southern Pacific Railroad 
tracks. Qwest became one of the United States’ largest Internet backbone 
providers.
Level 3 started life in 1985 with a focus on telecommunications. In 2011, it 
hit the big time by acquiring Global Crossing and its extensive Internet back-
bone infrastructure, which stretched across 27 countries on four continents.
Comcast is the only outlier in this roster of Tier 1 ISPs. It originated as a 
cable television company, with a network unrelated to the telephone sys-
tem.

RADIO
It may seem like radio has been around since the Stone Age, but curiously it 
was developed after the telegraph and telephone. Its contribution to modern 
technology is extensive. Without radio, we would have no cell phones and 
no Wi-Fi.
	How did the radio industry get its start? Guglielmo Marconi is 
credited as the person who invented the radio, a device that sends and 
receives sound as electromagnetic waves. Surprisingly, his 1895 invention 
was not intended to broadcast news and music, but rather to transmit wire-
less telegraph messages. 
It was not until 1906 that a Canadian physicist, Reginald Fessenden, 
managed to broadcast voice and music over a long distance. News of 
Fessenden’s accomplishment set off worldwide interest in radio technology. 
The availability of radio kits marked the beginning of radio’s Technology 
Trigger phase. Radios and computers had this development phase 
in common. Both were embraced by hobbyists who swapped tips, 
formed clubs, and eagerly awaited the publication of special-interest 
magazines. Radio enthusiasts looked forward to the latest issue of  
Radio News and Wireless Age. Years later, computer enthusiasts couldn’t 
wait to get their hands on Dr. Dobb’s Journal and Byte magazine. 
Like computer enthusiasts 50 years later, radio hobbyists built their own 
devices using kits or off-the-shelf parts. Hobbyist radios, referred to as 
“radio sets,” could both transmit and receive. Consequently, radio opera-
tors spent as much time talking to other radio enthusiasts as they spent 
receiving broadcasts. We now think of radios as one-way devices to pick up 
broadcasts, but early radio culture viewed these devices as two-way com-
munications platforms similar to CB radios or cell phones.
Prior to 1912, there were no laws or regulations restricting amateur radio 
transmission in the United States. Radio stations popped up everywhere, 
sometimes broadcasting on the same frequencies as neighboring stations, 
creating a muddle on the airwaves. During World War I, the U.S. govern-
ment took control of radio equipment as a national security precaution. 
Hundreds of independent radio stations were ordered shut down. 
After the war, civilians were again allowed to use radio technology, and radio 
entered a phase of mass diffusion to mainstream consumers (Figure 8-37).

	How did the radio affect mainstream consumers? The years 
between 1920 and 1960 are considered the Golden Age of Radio. During 
this time period, consumers snapped up millions of radios and spent hours 
listening to music, news, and variety shows. 
Modern Downton Abbey viewers saw a reenactment of the King of England’s 
first radio broadcast. The king’s 1924 broadcast generated so much antici-
pation that loudspeakers were set up outside many retail establishments so 
customers and passersby could gather and listen. 
On the other side of the Atlantic in 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt inau-
gurated his weekly fireside chats as a way of connecting “in person” to the 
American people (Figure 8-38). Today, the White House carries on the tra-
dition. Though only a few radio stations now carry the addresses, they are 
available online as YouTube videos. 
Figure 8-38: President Roosevelt’s fireside chats, 1933–1944
In the 1920s and 1930s, radios used vacuum tubes—a technology later 
used in first-generation computers such as ENIAC and UNIVAC. Radios 
were housed in desktops or freestanding units and usually constructed 
from ornately carved wood. In 1929, the average price of a radio was $139, 
equivalent to about $1,700 in today’s currency. Just four years later in the 
aftermath of the Great Depression, the price tumbled to only $47. Americans 
continued to purchase radios, and by 1933 about 60% of U.S. households 
owned one.
Following the trajectory of other new technologies, radio technology 
changed with the invention of the transistor. By substituting transistors for 
bulky and power-hungry vacuum tubes, transistor radios became portable 
and battery operated. Post–World War II baby boomers were just reaching 
their teen years when portable radios hit store shelves and became the cool 
way to listen to Elvis Presley and other icons of pop music. 
Mass-market television marked the end of radio’s Golden Age. Today, radio 
stations struggle to find a niche in the digital world through satellite radio, 
streaming Internet radio, and podcasts.

	Was the radio industry profitable? The radio industry includes 
companies that broadcast radio programs and that manufacture devices, 
such as radios and broadcast transmitters. Many early radio stations were 
operated by radio manufacturers whose primary interest was encouraging 
consumers to purchase radios. This strategy was successful until the mar-
ket was saturated. Looking around for a new profit model, station operators 
began selling advertising time to offset the cost of producing news and vari-
ety shows. 
Radio shows sponsored by companies advertising Ivory soap, Oxydol, and 
other cleaning products came to be known as soap operas. Advertising 
became the profit model for several modern technologies, including televi-
sion and the Web. And as consumers are well aware, today’s advertising 
technology is extremely sophisticated in its ability to collect and aggregate 
personal data for targeted ads on Web pages and in spam. By 2013, adver-
tising revenue generated on the Internet surpassed that of advertising on 
television, radio, and other platforms (Figure 8-39). 
	What did the radio industry contribute to today’s technol-
ogy? Radio technology is the basis for cell phones, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and 
near-field communications (NFC), all indispensable tools of the digital age. 
But it is the underlying technology of radio, not the broadcasting industry 
itself, that provides these high-tech amenities. Neither the cellular phone 
system nor Wi-Fi utilize radio broadcast facilities. At most, cellular service 
providers might share towers with radio stations. The technology contribu-
tion provided by radio is the means to transmit voice over long distances, 
and from that simple technology sprang the cellular telephone industry.

Cellular Phones
There’s a viral video on YouTube that appears to show a young woman 
walking among a group of people during the 1930s and using a cell phone. 
She holds it to her ear, smiles, and after a few seconds she seems to sign 
off and lower the phone. Was this pretty woman a time traveler carrying a 
cell phone? 
	What was the role of radio technology in the development 
of cellular phones? A cellular telephone is a device that uses a low-
power radio transmitter to carry out two-way voice communications. Cellular 
telephones were initially developed for military and law enforcement. 
Two-way radio technology went portable during World War II. Devices such 
as the 35-pound Radio Set SCR-300 were called “walkie-talkies” because 
their portability allowed a soldier to walk with the device and talk at the same 
time. As a backpack unit, however, the SCR-300 was typically operated by 
two soldiers: one to carry the device and one to tune in the call. As the war 
progressed, technological advancements produced the SCR-536, a large 
handheld unit (Figure 8-40).
Figure 8-40: These bulky devices are the ancestors of today’s cell phones
	When did modern cell phones appear? A Motorola engineer is 
credited with developing the first handheld cellular phone. It was brought 
to market in 1984 under the impressive model name Motorola DynaTAC 
8000X. The phone weighed almost two pounds, was more than 12 inches 
long, and contained a battery that lasted for only one hour of talk time. In 
the following 30 years, the cellular industry flourished. Devices became 
smaller, picked up a constellation of features, evolved through several “G” 
generations, and eventually went digital, culminating in the introduction of 
the iPhone in 2007 and the first Android phone in 2008 (Figure 8-41).

	What is the significance of the “G” generations? Mobile phone 
signaling technology evolved through four generations. These generations 
refer to the way signals are transmitted from a handset to a cell tower. For 
example, the signals used for 1G mobile communications were analog, 
whereas 2G signals were digital, and 3G systems used different frequency 
bands and spread spectrum transmission to increase bandwidth (Figure 
8-42).
Figure 8-42: Cell phone generations
	How does the cellular phone industry contribute to modern 
lifestyles? Cell phones became smartphones when they converged with 
computing devices and became capable of executing programs, manipu-
lating data, and accessing the Internet. Mobile phone services are offered 
around the globe from telecommunications giants, such as China Mobile, 
Vodafone, Airtel, T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. About half of the top 30 
service providers are government owned, while the rest are private-sector 
corporations.
Cellular providers have played a major role in placing computer power 
into the hands of consumers. Worldwide there were approximately 7 bil-
lion wireless service subscriptions in 2014, and about 2 billion of those 
subscribers used smartphones, according to reports from the International 
Telecommunication Union and telecom provider Ericsson. 
The first cellular phones to access the Internet and the Web were available 
in 1996. These phones were not exactly “smart” and used WAP (Wireless 
Application Protocol) to provide access to Web sites specially designed for 
the small screens and slow data transfer rates of early 3G feature phones. 
It is clear that smartphone use is booming, but do these devices produce 
lifestyle and economic benefits? A report from the European mobile tele-
communications organization GSMA optimistically states, “In the hands 
of consumers, these devices are improving living standards and chang-
ing lives, especially in developing markets, while contributing to growing 
economies by stimulating entrepreneurship.” Yes, an economy can benefit 
from revenues created when consumers purchase smartphones, but after 
the market is saturated, will those devices provide educational, career, and 
health benefits? That question is yet to be answered.

Television
On March 25, 1925, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird gave the first pub-
lic demonstration of televised images, at Selfridges department store in 
London. The image quality produced by Baird’s device was terrible com-
pared to that of film-based motion pictures of the time, but observers who 
understood that Baird’s images were “live” on the air must have been suit-
ably impressed.
	When was television available to consumers? The 1930s can 
be characterized as a phase of innovation for television, a technology 
designed to send moving images over a distance. During that phase of inno-
vation, a limited number of televisions were manufactured, broadcasting 
stations were few, and those stations were not on the air 24 hours a day.
The first mass-produced televisions were available to consumers in 1946. 
These devices contained a heavy and awkward cathode ray tube (CRT), 
which used an electron “gun” to essentially spray an image onto a fluo-
rescent screen. This technology was later used in monitors for the first 
generations of personal computers.
Television reception required two elements: a screen and an antenna. 
Initially, the two components were separate. The screen was housed 
in a cabinet, and the antenna was connected to the cabinet by a cable. 
Consumers could purchase the console and the antenna as a set, hence the 
commonly used term television set. Unlike “radio sets,” a television set did 
not include a transmitter; but like so many technologies at the beginning of 
their lifetime—including computers—televisions were supplied to consumers 
as several components rather than as a tidy, one-piece unit (Figure 8-43).
Figure 8-43: A television “set” from the 1960s
	How did television technology evolve? The first color television 
broadcast was in 1954, but the cost of color sets was out of reach for most 
consumers. Well into the 1960s, programming remained in black-and-white. 
In 1965, however, after most consumers had purchased black and white 
televisions, the networks transitioned to color programming. By 1972, pro-
gramming was in full color on all networks, and consumers began to retire 
their black-and-white sets and—much to the joy of the television industry—
purchase new color televisions. 
The transition to digital television (DTV) did not proceed as smoothly as the 
transition from black and white to color. Analog televisions cannot receive 
digital signals without the use of a converter box, so when stations switched 
to digital broadcasts, consumers required either a new digital television or a 
converter box for legacy equipment. The FCC mandated the switch to DTV, 
and in 2009, U.S. consumers entered the brave new world of DTV. 
Terminology
DTV is not the same as HDTV 
(high-definition television). 
DTV (digital television) can 
be broadcast in standard 
definition (SD) or high 
definition (HD). HDTV (high-
definition television) offers 
better quality because the 
vertical resolution is higher.

THE ICT INDUSTRY

The television industry began as a broadcast service, using the airwaves as 
a transmission medium much like its sister technology in the radio industry. 
Signals were broadcast from local towers and could be freely picked up by 
any set-top or rooftop antenna deployed by consumers. Television was a 
free service, supported solely by product advertisements—that is, until pay 
TV appeared.
	What is the origin of pay TV? Pay television is a subscription ser-
vice in which consumers pay to receive a selection of television channels. It 
offers a profitable way to monetize broadcast content using a subscription 
model similar to that used by the telephone industry. 
Pay television is essentially an offshoot of cable television, an innovation 
that began quite by accident in the 1940s when a television salesman strung 
a cable to a local hilltop to improve the reception and picture quality of the 
televisions for sale in the store. Customers wanted similar reception and 
signed up to be connected for $2 a month. The era of cable television and 
pay TV had begun, and by 2004, more households in the U.S. were watch-
ing cable television than broadcast television (Figure 8-44).
Figure 8-44: U.S. Cable television evolution
	How did the cable television industry become part of the 
Internet backbone? The use of cable television for Internet access varies 
substantially throughout the world. It is especially rare in Africa, where low-
income demographics make it difficult to recover the high cost of building 
necessary infrastructure. The United States is somewhat unique because it 
is one of the few countries in which cable television played a prominent role 
in supplying Internet service.
The U.S. cable television industry includes giant corporations such as 
Comcast, Cox Communications, Charter Communications, and Time Warner 
Cable. These companies deployed hundreds of thousands of miles of high-
capacity coaxial and optical fiber cables directly to homes. This infrastructure 
became a logical communications pathway for Internet service because it 
was already in place and offered higher capacity than the telephone com-
pany’s dial-up service. 
Terminology
Pay television (or pay TV) is 
not the same as pay per view, 
which allows consumers to 
purchase a specific television 
show or broadcast event.

1996 was the year that cable Internet service made its debut. Time Warner 
Cable offered Road Runner service, and Comcast partnered with Excite@
Home. Through a series of acquisitions and peering agreements with Tier 1 
ISPs, by 2001, Comcast had emerged as the largest U.S. Internet service 
provider and soon became a significant part of the Internet backbone. 
At the same time, however, cable Internet subscriptions were beginning 
to decline as consumers began migrating to mobile wireless services. It 
appears that the Internet access story is yet unfinished and there are more 
changes ahead for the telecommunications industry.
	What might lie ahead? The future is difficult to predict, except to say 
that it is likely to be different. In retrospect, it is clear that a convergence 
between the computer industry and the telecommunications industry was 
inevitable. Looking at the trend lines in Figure 8-45, you may be able to look

jobs and salaries 
Computing devices are everywhere, but not every job that involves a com-
puter is considered a technical occupation. Not surprisingly, the boundaries 
that delineate tech sector careers are subject to various classifications, per-
haps because the tech sector itself is still evolving. 
	What are tech sector jobs? Tech sector careers can be defined as 
being part of a broad set of information, technology, and communications 
industries, or more narrowly regarded as being part of the computer indus-
try. A broad classification of technology workers encompasses jobs such 
as telephone cable installers and radio broadcasters, as well as computer 
programmers, Web designers, and software developers.
A different classification of tech sector careers comes from STEM (science, 
engineering, technology, and math). STEM was originally used to describe 
a group of academic disciplines, but it is increasingly used to define an 
employment sector that includes jobs in biology, chemistry, information tech-
nology, engineering, math, and physics. 
A third, more narrow, classification of tech sector careers focuses on com-
puter professionals. In 1999, the U.S. Congress crafted an amendment 
to the Fair Labor Standards Act that essentially defines a computer pro-
fessional as any person whose primary occupation involves the design, 
configuration, analysis, development, modification, testing, or security of 
computer hardware or software. We’ll focus on those careers in this section.
	What kinds of jobs are available to computer professionals? 
Many computer professionals work in an IT department—the wing of a 
business or an organization responsible for computer, data, software, and 
support services. An IT department is also responsible for prioritizing an 
organization’s information needs, modifying old information systems as 
necessary, and creating new systems. 
Historically, IT departments were part of an organization’s finance depart-
ment because computers were initially deployed for accounting and 
inventory management functions. As computers began to assist with a wider 
variety of business tasks, some organizations changed their organizational 
charts to make the IT department a separate entity headed by a chief infor-
mation ­officer (CIO), who reports directly to the chief executive officer or 
president. Figure 8-46 illustrates the organization of a typical IT department.
Terminology
With the wide variety of digital 
devices in use today and the 
pervasive digitization of so 
many aspects of the private 
and public sector, the term 
computer professional is 
beginning to seem outdated. 
This term may be in transition 
to STEM worker, tech worker, 
or IT professional.
Terminology
A CIO (chief information 
officer) is sometimes called a 
CTO (chief technology officer).

What are typical IT jobs? IT jobs revolve around computers and net-
works that help an organization carry out its mission. There are hundreds of 
IT jobs, but the majority of entry-level positions tend to be similar to those 
listed in Figure 8-47.
A systems analyst investigates the requirements of a business or an organization, 
its employees, and its customers in order to plan and implement new or improved 
computer services. This job requires the ability to identify problems and research 
technical solutions. Good communication skills are essential for interacting with 
managers and other employees.
A computer programmer (sometimes described as a programmer/analyst) 
designs, codes, and tests computer programs. In addition, programmers modify 
existing programs to meet new requirements or eliminate bugs. Computer pro-
gramming requires concentration and a good memory for the countless details that 
pertain to a programming project. Programming projects range from entertainment 
and games to business and productivity applications. Programmers get ­satisfaction 
from devising efficient ways to make a computer perform specific jobs, tasks, and 
routines.
A security specialist analyzes a computer system’s vulnerability to threats from 
viruses, worms, unauthorized access, and physical damage. Security specialists 
install and configure firewalls and antivirus software. They also work with man-
agement and employees to develop policies and procedures to protect computer 
equipment and data. Computer security jobs are punctuated by crises when a virus 
hits or a security breach is discovered. A security specialist must have a wide-rang-
ing knowledge of computers and communication protocols that can be applied for a 
quick resolution to any crisis that occurs.
A database administrator analyzes a company’s data to determine the most effec-
tive way to collect and store it. Database administrators create databases, data 
entry forms, and reports. They also define backup procedures, provide access to 
authorized users, and supervise the day-to-day use of databases.
A network administrator plans, installs, and maintains one or more local area 
networks and may also manage cloud resources. These specialists provide net-
work accounts and access rights to approved users. They troubleshoot connectivity 
problems and respond to requests from network users for new software. Network 
administrators might be responsible for maintaining the security of a network, plus 
they often pick up Web master duties to maintain an organization’s Web site.
A computer operator works with system software for network servers, mainframes, 
and supercomputers. Computer operators monitor computer performance, install 
software patches and upgrades, perform backups, and restore data as necessary.
A technical support specialist troubleshoots hardware and software problems. 
Good interpersonal skills and patience are required for this job.
A Web site developer creates, tests, posts, and modifies Web pages. A good sense 
of design and artistic talent are required for this job, along with an understanding of 
how people use graphical user interfaces. Familiarity with Web tools, such as HTML 
and JavaScript, is becoming more important for this job, as is a knowledge of com-
puter programming and database management.
A social networking analyst manages an organization’s online reputation by 
establishing and maintaining social media sites and evaluating analytics to support 
its mission. This occupation requires familiarity with social networking sites and an 
ability to interpret statistical metrics obtained from analytical tools.

	What’s the outlook for IT careers? According to an Information 
Technology Association of America study, the U.S.-based IT workforce 
totaled about 10.4 million in 2000, but lost 500,000 jobs in 2001 as the dot-
com bubble burst. A small but steady upswing from 2002 through 2006 
brought the IT workforce close to its year 2000 peak, but the workforce 
again suffered cutbacks during the economic recession that began in 2008. 
In coming years, the highest demand may be for network, technical support, 
and security specialists. The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics predicts 
that in the decade 2012–2022, employment in the information and technol-
ogy sector could grow by 18%, generating 650,000 new jobs. An unknown 
percentage of these jobs will be outsourced, which may negatively affect 
U.S. workers but will benefit offshore workers.
As in the past, economic trends could cause significant changes in the job 
market. In preparing for an IT career, flexibility is the key. You should be will-
ing to train and then retrain as new skills are needed to work with emerging 
technologies. 
	What are typical starting salaries in IT? Web sites such as www.
bls.gov provide salary data for various IT industry jobs. In addition to data 
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, you can find comparative IT industry 
salary averages using a standard Web search engine.
As with almost every industry, the compensation rates for jobs in the IT 
industry vary. Jobs that require college degrees and certification tend to 
pay more than jobs that require a high school diploma and some on-the-job 
training. IT industry salaries also vary by geographic location. In the United 
States, the highest salaries tend to be offered in the Northeast and on the 
West Coast—two regions where the cost of living is relatively high.
	Do IT jobs offer good advancement opportunities? Workers in 
the IT industry have a fair amount of career mobility. Companies with large IT 
departments can offer in-house advancement, while workers in smaller firms 
might have to move up the career ladder by shifting to a different company. 
An entry-level worker could, for example, begin as an associate program-
mer, then advance to programmer status, then to senior programmer, and 
finally to lead programmer. Figure 8-48 illustrates additional advancement 
paths.

THE ICT INDUSTRY

	What are the advantages of working in the IT industry? Many 
­technology companies offer employee-friendly working conditions that 
include child care, flexible hours, and the opportunity to work from home. 
As in any industry, the exact nature of a job depends on the company and 
the particular projects that are in the works. Some jobs and projects are 
more interesting than others (Figure 8-49).
	What are the demographics of tech workers? Computer profes-
sionals tend to be Caucasian and Asian men, with lower representation 
of individuals who identify as women, Hispanic, Latino, Black, or African-
American. Representation varies significantly by occupation even within 
tech sector jobs. For example, there are far more female Web develop-
ers than female network architects. Black and African-American database 
administrators outnumber their counterparts who are software developers. 
Individual workplaces differ, too. At Google, 70% of the total workforce 
is male, though males make up 80% of its technical workforce. The dis-
crepancy appears to mean that a significant number of female Google 
employees are not technical workers but instead hold clerical positions. 
Yahoo has a female CEO, but 85% of the technical workforce is male—
and of that percentage, more than half is Asian.
Most tech sector companies are committed to a diverse workforce, but 
qualified minority applicants are sometimes difficult to find. The number of 
women earning computer science degrees has leveled off at a mere 18%. 
Blacks and Hispanics each make up about 9% of computer science gradu-
ates. Workplace demographics have become a complex and controversial 
issue. Both tech sector businesses and educational institutions are seek-
ing ways to boost minority participation. 
	What about part-time or contract work? As with other industries, 
IT employs full-time, part-time, and contract workers. A contract worker is 
hired as a consultant. Contract workers are not official employees of a com-
pany. They might be paid by the job, rather than by the hour; they are not 
eligible for a company’s health insurance benefits or retirement plan, and 
they must pay self-employment taxes. 
IT businesses benefit from the ability to hire contract workers. The pool of IT 
contract workers offers a selection of people with specialized skills. Contract 
workers can be added to a company’s staff when needed, instead of hir-
ing full-time workers who might later be laid off if the company is forced to 
downsize.

SECTION d, Unit 8
	Can I work at an IT job from home? Workers in many industries 
are interested in becoming a telecommuter who uses available technol-
ogy to work from home or an off-site location. Telecommuters tend to be 
more productive and work longer hours because they have no commute 
time and they are not interrupted by routine office chatter. When fuel 
prices are high, telecommuting looks even more attractive to workers who 
can save money by avoiding long commutes.
Telecommuting does have its disadvantages. Some workers need supervi-
sion or they procrastinate. The home environment can be distracting, which 
reduces productivity. Security is also a concern—especially the security of 
data transmitted from home-based workers to corporate networks. Virtual 
private networks, encryption, and secure connections are essential for 
securing business data transmitted over the Internet.
The Internet and telecommunications technologies have made an impact on 
the ­availability of telecommuting opportunities for workers. It has become 
common for employees to collaborate through email, fax, groupware, and 
videoconferencing. Although the majority of IT workers still commute to 
work, industry observers expect the number of telecommuting IT workers to 
increase. Programming and customer support are likely to be the first jobs 
with a significant number of telecommuting workers. 
	How do I find an IT job? Finding a job in the IT industry is similar to 
finding a job in most other industries. Effective job seekers begin by taking 
stock of their qualifications, identifying job titles relevant to their skills, iden-
tifying potential employers, and considering the geographic area in which 
they want to work.
Networking, both in person and online, is important. Job seekers should 
maximize their use of LinkedIn and similar social networking tools. Local jobs 
can sometimes be found on Craigslist. In addition to mega job sites, such 
as Monster, several smaller sites that specialize in tech job listings include 
Dice.com, GitHub Jobs, Gigaom Tech Jobs, ITJobPro, and ComputerJobs 
(Figure 8-50).

SECTION D, Unit 8
	What are the basic qualifications for IT industry jobs? 
Qualifications for most IT industry jobs include some type of higher edu-
cation, certification, or computer experience. A bachelor’s degree in a 
computer-related discipline is the most prevalent requirement, but some 
employers accept a two-year associate’s degree. 
	What kinds of computer jobs require only an associate’s 
degree? Colleges, community colleges, and technical schools offer 
­computer-related associate’s degrees, ranging from computer program-
ming to computer graphics, networking, and telecommunications. 
The curriculum for these programs varies from one degree program to 
another, but all tend to require intensive course work. Graduates of two-
year programs commonly find employment as entry-level technicians, 
programmers, and support ­personnel. Advancement opportunities might 
be limited, however, without additional education or certification.
	Do I need a graduate degree? Master’s degrees in software engi-
neering have been difficult to find, except at large research universities 
with well-established computer science programs. A master’s degree in 
computer science is available at most colleges and universities that offer 
graduate degrees. Another option at the graduate level is to pursue a 
master’s degree in information systems or a master’s degree in business 
administration (MBA). Any of these graduate degrees would help you get a 
management position in the computer industry.
Doctoral degrees are available in software engineering, applications soft-
ware engineering, systems software development, and management 
information systems. A doctoral degree in any of these areas would qualify 
you for advanced technical research or for a position as a college professor. 
The graph in Figure 8-52 shows which IT professions tend to require higher 
levels of educational attainment.

Certification
According to a study by resume specialists, recruiters spend an average of 
six seconds looking at a resume before deciding to reject it or save it for fur-
ther consideration. That gives applicants little time to make an impression. 
By adding computer-related certifications to solid educational credentials, 
some job seekers hope to make the cut. 
	How important is certification? Certification alone is rarely suffi-
cient to qualify for a job in the IT industry. However, several studies suggest 
that certification paired with a college degree or extensive experience can 
improve your chances for employment, increase your credibility in the work-
place, and lead to higher salaries. 
Many employers view certification with some degree of skepticism, however, 
so the value of a certificate depends on where, when, and how it is obtained. 
Critics of certification exams, for example, maintain that a multiple-choice 
test cannot accurately measure a person’s ability to deal with real-world 
equipment and software. Bottom line: Certification is only part of your total 
package of qualifications.
	How do I get certified? Certificates are awarded based on successful 
completion of an exam that verifies your level of knowledge about a particu-
lar ­technology or subject. Most of these exams use ­multiple-choice format, 
last several hours, and require substantial testing fees. Some certification 
exams also have a practical component that requires candidates to demon-
strate skills. 
	How do I prepare? You can prepare for a certification exam with 
independent study materials, an exam preparation class, or online tutorials 
(Figure 8-53).

SECTION D, Unit 8
	What kind of certification is available? Approximately 300 com-
puter-related certification exams are offered in areas of specialty that range 
from desktop publishing to ­network installation. Certification exams can be 
divided into ­several ­categories, including the following:
General computer knowledge. IC3 certification, offered by Certiport, 
covers basic computing knowledge and skills. General certification is also 
offered by the College Board’s Computer Skills Placement (CSP). 
The Institute for the Certification of Computing Professionals (ICCP) offers 
generalized certification exams, such as the Information Systems Core, lead-
ing to Certified Computing Professional certification. According to the ICCP 
Web site, “Professionals certified with ICCP serve as consultants, working 
with local, state, and federal government; in accounting and banking; in high 
schools, technical schools, and universities; in the manufacturing industry; in 
insurance and numerous other fields.” 
Software applications. Many certification exams allow you to demon-
strate your prowess with a specific software application. The Microsoft Office 
Specialist (MOS) certification is perhaps the most popular, but of limited 
value to most computer ­professionals who are expected to be able to quickly 
learn such applications on their own. Certification in productivity applications 
is most valuable for entry-level secretarial and clerical positions as well as 
help desk personnel.
Autodesk offers the AutoCAD Certified User exam on the use of its 3-D 
design software. Certification is also available for popular Adobe ­software 
applications, such as Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Flash, 
and ColdFusion. 
Database administration. Databases require a high level of expertise, not 
only in the use of database software, but also in the conception and design 
of database structures. Many computer professionals have sought certifica-
tion in database systems, such as Oracle, Access, Sybase, and DB2. The 
most popular database certification exams include the Microsoft Certified 
Database Administrator and Oracle Certified Professional.
Networking. Among computer professionals, network certification might 
be the most useful. Microsoft offers a corresponding MCSE certifica-
tion (Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert). Network hardware certification 
includes the Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP), offered by net-
work equipment supplier Cisco Systems. Wireless network certification, such 
as CCNP Wireless certification, is available, too. RedHat Certified Engineer 
and CompTIA Network+ are two additional offerings.
Computer hardware. One of the most popular computer hardware cer-
tifications is the A+ Certification, sponsored by the Computing Technology 
Industry Association (CompTIA). This certification process is designed to 
measure the competency of entry-level computer service technicians for 
installing, configuring, upgrading, troubleshooting, and repairing personal 
computer systems. A+ Certification provides good credentials for employ-
ment in a computer store or computer repair shop.
Computer security. With the proliferation of computer viruses and worms, 
computer security has become a hot niche for IT workers. The CompTIA 
Security+ Certification is well regarded. The International Information 
Systems Security Certification Consortium offers a Certified Information 
Systems Security Professional (CISSP) exam, which is one of the highest 
paying IT certifications available.

resumes
Some large corporations use computer algorithms to sift through moun-
tains of job applications and extract a select few that meet a set of exacting 
specifications. Recruiters cruise LinkedIn and other social media sites. And 
corporate computers link to online job databases to compile a short list of 
promising candidates. Job seekers have to cover a lot of bases these days.
	What’s the best format for an effective resume? There is no 
“best” format for resumes in today’s job market. Job seekers need to pro-
duce resumes in a variety of formats, including the following:
Print. You should save one version of your resume as a beautifully for-
matted word processing file. You might consider using desktop publishing 
software to put the finishing touches on your resume before printing it on 
high-quality paper. Make sure that you can output the file that holds your 
resume into a PDF that can be read on either a Mac or a PC in case a pro-
spective employer asks you to send it as an email attachment. 
Email. Before sending your resume as an attachment, try to discover the 
format that is easiest for your prospective employer to use. PDF is a univer-
sally accepted format. Microsoft’s DOC and DOCX formats are also widely 
used. 
Some career counselors advise against the use of email attachments, sug-
gesting that many employers never open attachments for fear of email 
viruses. Instead of attaching your resume, you can simply paste it into the 
body of an email message. To make sure it is formatted for maximum read-
ability, consider creating an ASCII version of your resume, without fancy 
fonts, bullets, or symbols. This ASCII version might also be useful for online 
job posting sites that store your resume information in a searchable data-
base. 
HTML. You might also create an HTML version of your resume. You can 
paste the HTML version into an HTML-formatted email message or post it 
on a Web site provided by your school or ISP. 
LinkedIn. Your LinkedIn account can serve as a resume, so make sure that 
it is fully populated with your career data. LinkedIn also offers a service that 
outputs a one-page PDF based on your profile data. To experiment with this 
service, look for the LinkedIn Resume Builder.
Online job service. Resume formats for online services vary. Some 
accept uploaded resumes in PDF or DOCX formats, while others store a 
job seeker’s credentials in a series of database fields. When using an online 
service, take the time to learn about all the resume options it offers.
Web portfolio. A Web portfolio is a hypertext version of your resume, 
which might ­contain links to relevant Web sites, such as past employers, 
your alma mater, and samples of your work. For example, a programmer 
might include a link to one of her particularly well-documented and elegant 
programs, or a Web designer might provide links to sites that he designed.
You can post your Web portfolio on your personal Web site. As an alterna-
tive, you can create a blog with links to your work. Web sites that offer tools 
to create an online portfolio are easy to find. As with other cloud-based tools, 
check out the site before you commit substantial time and effort to the task 
of linking your portfolio. You want to make sure the site stays in business 
long enough for you to complete your job search.

	Should an IT industry resume contain any special elements? 
Regardless of the industry in which you seek employment, an effective 
resume is clear, correct, and easy to read. Recruiters spend 80% of their 
time looking for the following resume items: applicant’s name, current job 
title and company, previous job title and company, job start and end dates, 
and education. Make sure these items stand out on your resume so they 
are easy to find. Figure 8-55 shows a short checklist of resume writing 
guidelines.
Be clear and concise.
	 Eliminate unnecessary words, phrases, and sentences. 
	 Be efficient with words when describing tasks, duties, titles, and 
accomplishments. 
	 Be brief and to the point without selling yourself short.
Place the most important point first.
	 List your qualifications by importance and relevance to the job you 
seek.
	 Summarize skills at the top of the resume.
	 Use a bold font to emphasize skills and accomplishments that are 
required for the position you seek. 
	 Include pertinent information about training, certification, and 
professional affiliations, but avoid personal information, such as 
church affiliation and hobbies, that is not directly related to the job.
Use language effectively.
	 Target terms and wording to prospective employers. 
	 Use industry jargon wherever appropriate. 
	 Use action verbs to maintain the reader’s interest. 
	 Use past and present tenses consistently.
	 Double-check grammar and spelling.
	 When posting information in a database, use nouns that describe your 
skills.

ICT Laws
Laws are legislated documentation of permissible behavior based on a 
community’s ethics. As computers and digital technologies play a more 
central role in every aspect of daily life, laws have been created to deal 
with computer uses and abuses. 
	What is information technology law? Information technology 
law is the legal framework that applies to the collection, storage, and dis-
tribution of digital information. Technology is governed by laws that existed 
long before computers were invented. Libel laws, for example, pertain to 
false and personally damaging statements regardless of whether they are 
published in print or online. 
Laws and regulations have been specifically written to deal with problems 
generated by emerging digital technologies. For example, the Computer 
Fraud and Abuse Act, passed in 1996, makes it a crime to access a com-
puter and the data it contains without authorization. Existing theft laws did 
not adequately cover theft of digital data that can be “stolen” yet still remain 
in the possession of the original owner. Some of the most significant areas 
of information technology law include the following:
Copyright and intellectual property. Are mashups transformative or 
derivative works? Can libraries make copyrighted works available online?
Domain names. Who moderates domain name disputes? Is it legal to 
buy and sell domain names? Should domain names for trademarks be 
available to someone other than the trademark holder?
Patents. Are software patents socially beneficial, or should software be 
copyrighted instead? Can inventors obtain a patent for an idea such as 
one-click purchases?
Cybercrime. What is the legal definition of cyberbullying? Is it a crime to 
masquerade as someone else on social media sites? Are digital curren-
cies, such as Bitcoin, legal or are they examples of counterfeiting?
Software and computer contracts. Are digital signatures legally 
binding? If consumers click “I agree” when installing software, have they 
entered into a legal contract?
Privacy. Is it constitutional for the National Security Agency (NSA) to col-
lect private communications without a search warrant? Should privately 
controlled drones be allowed to take photographs through home and office 
windows? Under what circumstances can individuals be forced to reveal 
their passwords to law enforcement agents?
Communication. Can hotels use jamming devices to prevent guests 
from using their own Wi-Fi hotspots? Can a university block a student-run 
faculty evaluation Web site? Should government employees be fired for 
speaking out on social media? Should sexting be illegal?
Laws relating to technology vary from country to country. Figure 8-56 on 
the next page provides a brief overview of the most significant technology 
laws and court decisions in the United States.

SECTION e, Unit 8
United States Copyright Act (1976) extends copyright 
protection beyond print media to “original works of 
authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, 
now known or later developed, from which they can be 
perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, 
either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.” 
Fair Use Doctrine, a part of the U.S. Copyright Act, 
generally allows copying if it is for educational or 
personal use, if only a portion of the original work is 
copied, and if it does not have a substantial effect on 
the market for the original work.
Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios (1984) sets 
a precedent that companies are not liable for user 
infringements, such as using VCRs to make unauthor-
ized copies of videotapes, so long as the technology 
has valid, non-infringing uses, such as copying per-
sonal home videos. In recent cases, the defense for 
peer-to-peer file sharing networks was based on this 
decision.
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1986 amended in 
1994, 1996, 2001, and USA PATRIOT Act) makes it a 
criminal offense to knowingly access a computer with-
out authorization; transmit a program, information, a 
code, or a command that causes damage; or distribute 
passwords that would enable unauthorized access.
Electronic Communications Privacy Act (1986) 
extends telephone wiretap laws by restricting gov-
ernment agents and unauthorized third parties from 
tapping into data transmissions without a search war-
rant. The law does not apply to data, such as email, 
transmitted on employer-owned equipment.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(1996) requires health care providers to take reason-
able procedural and technical safeguards to insure the 
confidentiality of individually identifiable health infor-
mation.
Communications Decency Act (1996) protects ISPs 
from liability for defamatory statements made by cus-
tomers. Prohibits material deemed offensive by local 
community standards from being transmitted to minors. 
The latter section was overturned in 2002. 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998) makes it 
illegal to circumvent copy-protection technologies, such 
as those used to prevent unauthorized copying of soft-
ware CDs, music CDs, and movie DVDs. In addition, 
it is illegal to distribute any type of software-cracking 
technology that would be used by others to circum-
vent copy protection. Protects ISPs against copyright 
infringement by subscribers if the ISP takes prompt 
action to block the infringement as soon as it discovers 
illegal activity. 
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (1998) 
regulates the types of data that can be collected and 
posted online with regard to children under the age of 
13.
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (1999) requires financial 
institutions to protect the confidentiality and security of 
customers’ personal information.
Children’s Internet Protection Act (2000) requires 
schools and libraries that receive federal funds to 
implement filtering software that protects adults and 
minors from obscenity and pornography. 
USA PATRIOT Act (2001) enhances the authority of 
law enforcement agents to preempt potential terrorist 
acts by various means, such as monitoring electronic 
communications without first obtaining a search warrant 
in situations where there is imminent danger. Offers 
safe harbor to ISPs that voluntarily disclose potentially 
threatening activities of users. Increases maximum 
penalties for hackers.
Homeland Security Act (2002) establishes a 
Department of Homeland Security with an agency to 
monitor threats to the communications infrastructure, 
including the Internet, and exempts from the Privacy 
Act any information about infrastructure vulnerabilities 
to terrorism submitted by individuals or non-federal 
agencies.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) establishes financial 
reporting regulations to prevent corporate fraud. 
Requires full disclosure in accounting systems and pro-
tects corporate whistleblowers.
CAN-SPAM Act (2003) establishes national standards 
for sending commercial email by requiring senders to 
use a valid subject line, include the sender’s legitimate 
physical address, and provide an opt-out mechanism.
Green v. America Online (2003) interprets sections of 
the Communications Decency Act to mean that ISPs 
are not responsible for malicious software transmitted 
over their services by hackers.
MGM v. Grokster (2005) refines the precedent set in 
the 1984 Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios case. 
Companies that actively encourage infringement, as 
seemed to be true of peer-to-peer file sharing networks 
such as Grokster, can be held accountable for user 
infringement.
Authors Guild v. HathiTrust (2014) allows Google and 
local libraries to copy and store millions of copyrighted 
works and display their contents in the context of 
search engine results.

ICT ETHICS
Although most laws are designed to promote ethical behavior, laws and 
ethics are not necessarily the same. Some behaviors are legal, but not 
necessarily ethical. Some laws are not ethical or their ethics are contro-
versial. An act isn’t ethical simply because it is permissible or you can 
get away with it. An ethical person often chooses to do more than the law 
requires and less than the law allows. 
	What are professional ethics? The term professional ethics refers 
to on-the-job choices and actions that reflect a person’s values. Professional 
ethics are derived from principles of right and wrong. In most modern soci-
eties, the foundation for ethical decisions and actions is based on values 
such as impartiality, fairness, objectivity, honesty, regard for privacy, com-
mitment to quality, and respect for others. 
Professional ethics define standards of conduct that specify how workers 
should behave, particularly in situations where doing the right thing might 
not have short-term rewards, or when doing something of questionable 
legality seems to offer attractive benefits. Situations, like the one in Figure 
8-57, in which you ask yourself “What’s the right thing to do?” often require 
ethical decisions.
	Why are professional ethics important for IT workers? Most 
computer professionals are hardworking and honest. They take pride in 
their work and strive to offer excellent products and services that benefit 
consumers. They want to do what’s right. Sometimes, however, computer 
professionals have to cope with ethical dilemmas in which the right course 
of action is not entirely clear, or in which the right course of action is clear, 
but the consequences—such as getting fired—are not easy to face. 
Ethical dilemmas in the workplace are more common than you might imag-
ine. It is likely that you’ll find yourself in an ethical quandary about some 
aspect of your job even before you’ve completed your first year. Some situ-
ations that call for an ethical decision don’t require an immediate response, 
so you can take some time to think about what you’ll do. Other situations 
require an immediate response. In those situations, you’ll be less likely to 
take action that you’ll later regret if you have considered potentially compro-
mising situations ahead of time and have prepared some general guidelines 
you can use if necessary. 
	What kinds of situations in an IT career might require ethical 
decisions? Situations that require computer professionals to make ethical 
decisions often involve software copyrights, privacy, conflict of interest, use 
of work computers, software quality, hacking, and social responsibility. 
Sometimes, computer professionals are pressured to participate in activi-
ties that border on being illegal and are clearly unethical. These marginal 
activities are sometimes justified with statements such as “Everyone does 
it.” or “No one will know.” Employees might be assured that “You won’t be 
responsible.” or “It’s for the good of the company.” However, such justifica-
tions are not always true or appropriate.
Outside of corporate IT departments, individual entrepreneurs sometimes 
get caught up in unethical activities because they make bad judgments or 
have not done their homework regarding applicable laws and regulations.

SECTION e, Unit 8
	How would software copyrights become an eth-
ical issue? Most computer professionals are familiar with 
the general principles of copyright law and the provisions 
of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. They understand it 
is illegal to make unauthorized copies of software and other 
copyrighted media, such as commercial music and mov-
ies. Programmers, Web designers, and other creative 
professionals tend to respect intellectual property and try 
to adhere to copyright laws and license agreements. Tech 
workers are sometimes asked to install software or post 
copyrighted material that is not properly licensed. 
Managers are not always familiar with current copyright 
restrictions or choose to ignore them. Computer profes-
sionals should stay up to date on current copyright law that 
applies to software and other digital media. Asking for a copy 
of a software license agreement is considered standard 
practice and can help resolve questions about the legality of 
copying software for use in multiple-user installations. 
	What kinds of ethical issues pertain to privacy? 
It is ethical to respect the privacy of others, but business 
practices can clash with privacy rights. Network technicians 
occasionally see the content of email messages or files in the 
course of system maintenance or troubleshooting. 
Most professionals simply try to forget what they see. 
However, computer professionals sometimes come across 
a file or an email message that’s troubling. It might be a 
message from an employee who is corresponding with a 
competing company about a job offer. More seriously, a mes-
sage might divulge proprietary information to the competitor, 
harass another employee, or describe plans for other illegal 
activities. If your employer has no guidelines for reporting 
suspicious activities, you’ll have to make your own decision 
about what kinds of information are serious threats.
Computers are increasingly used to monitor employee activi-
ties. RFID chips embedded in ID badges can be used to 
track employee locations in an office or manufacturing facil-
ity. Keystroke monitors, random samples of active programs, 
Web browsing history, network logs, and email volume offer 
additional ways to monitor employee activities. Some surveil-
lance is done with employee knowledge and consent, such 
as when it is clearly explained in an employment contract or 
company policy. Other surveillance is surreptitious.
Either way, surveillance is set up by someone, often a pro-
grammer or network administrator. How would you respond if 
you were asked to set up a remote monitoring system like the 
one in Figure 8-58? 
Employees—particularly computer professionals—should 
be familiar with laws and company policy applicable to pri-
vacy. Privacy laws differ from one country to the next, and 
most companies have unique privacy policies. Rather than 
assume you know the rules, check applicable documents 
before you take action.

local public school district that is distributing 
laptop computers to students. One day, the 
superintendent of schools calls you into her 
office and explains that the district needs 
some way to locate laptops that might be 
misplaced or stolen. She asks if you can write 
a utility that will remotely activate laptop 
cameras. You realize that it would be easy to 
write such remote monitoring software. You 
also realize, however, that the software could 
be used to surreptitiously monitor students. 
You ask the superintendent if students and 
parents would be aware of the monitoring 
software, and she replies, “What they don’t 
know won’t hurt them.” What would you do?
a.	 I would write the program.
b.	 I’d write the program, but start a rumor 
that monitoring software is being used to 
remotely activate cameras on laptops.
c.	 I’d pretend that it was technically 
impossible to write such software.

	How might confidentiality lead to ethical dilemmas? 
Confidentiality is the obligation not to disclose willingly any information that 
should be kept private. Confidentiality rights apply to individuals and orga-
nizations. With respect to individuals, confidentiality means not disclosing 
names and associated data from databases and other information reposito-
ries. 
Laws in most countries restrict the disclosure of an individual’s medical or 
financial information. Marketers, however, currently take advantage of gray 
areas in these laws to use names, addresses, and phone numbers collected 
with consent on forms, applications, and Web sites. The ethics of such prac-
tices are doubtful.
With respect to organizations, confidentiality means protecting proprietary 
information about company finances, procedures, products, and research 
that competitors would find valuable. Computer professionals can find 
themselves in compromising situations where they are asked to disclose 
confidential information gathered while employed in previous jobs.
Job mobility is one of the perks of a hot career field. The skills you pick up 
on one job can increase your qualifications for other jobs. For example, you 
might learn about multimedia production while working for an educational 
software company, and those skills could provide you with qualifications to 
switch to a higher-paying and more challenging job working for an online 
game company.
Using your skills as a springboard to a new job is perfectly acceptable, but 
disclosing confidential information is not ethical in most situations, such as 
the one in Figure 8-59.
Stephen Simpson/Getty Images
Many employment contracts contain a non-compete clause designed 
to prevent employees from divulging proprietary information to competi-
tors or opening competing businesses. Non-compete clauses can extend 
beyond the period of employment and can remain in effect for a specified 
time after you leave a job. Most non-compete clauses, however, fail to delin-
eate exactly what information cannot be divulged, and so ex-employees are 
forced to make ethical decisions about competitive information. 
To avoid compromising situations, you can check the business plans of 
prospective employers so that you won’t be working on projects that com-
pete directly with those at your previous place of employment. You can also 
have a frank discussion with your new boss to outline the boundaries of the 
knowledge you are able to share from your old job.

SECTION e, Unit 8
	Can I get into trouble by using my work 
computer for personal activities? When sur-
veyed, a majority of computer professionals admit that 
they see no problem using their work computers for 
personal activities as long as it has no adverse effect 
on the employer. 
It seems innocent enough to send and receive per-
sonal email over your account at work or place bids 
on an online auction, especially if you do so during 
your lunch hour. Maybe it also seems okay to use 
your corporate email server to send bulk mail to raise 
money for a private, nonprofit relief organization. Your 
employer might not agree, however. 
There is a temptation to use computers, copiers, and 
network connections at work for personal activities; 
the equipment is convenient and usually cutting edge. 
Most companies have explicit policies about what is 
and what is not acceptable use. Some policies are 
strict, but designed to prevent conflicts like the one in 
Figure 8-60. 
It is never a good idea to use facilities at work for 
personal activities unless you have a specific agree-
ment with your employer and your activities do not 
breach your employment contract. Some employment 
contracts have restrictions pertaining to intellectual 
property. In the most restrictive contracts, anything 
employees develop at work or at home using on-the-
job equipment or knowledge during their tenure of 
employment belongs to the company. 
If your contract does not limit outside development, 
you might still have to make an ethical decision about 
what rightfully belongs to your company and what you 
created outside of your company’s sphere of influ-
ence.
	Why would I get involved in hacking? 
Computer professionals have to keep up with the lat-
est threats from viruses and intrusion attempts, but 
“knowing your enemy” can be a double-edged sword. 
Most computing students learning about virus and 
intrusion countermeasures become more than a little 
curious about these technologies. “Is it really so easy 
to design and launch viruses?” they wonder. “Are 
passwords easy to crack? Do I have the skill to do it?” 
Pursuing these questions can get students and com-
puter professionals into sticky ethical situations like 
the one in Figure 8-61.

	Am I responsible for software quality? Most 
computer professionals believe that software should 
be thoroughly tested to produce the most reliable and 
accurate product possible. But what if you encounter a 
situation like the one in Figure 8-62?
Software development is an incredibly complex under-
taking. Bugs are virtually impossible to completely 
eradicate, so most companies have policies that 
guide developers on the number, severity, and type of 
bugs that are acceptable when the software ships to 
customers. Although developers, managers, and mar-
keters are supposed to be governed by these policies, 
software testing cycles are sometimes cut short when 
deadlines loom. Computer professionals working on 
such projects should speak out when serious risks to 
users might result.
	Am I responsible for how my work is used? 
Technology may be neutral in and of itself, but tech-
nology can be put to use in both positive and negative 
ways. 
Some IT projects are clearly not socially responsible. 
For example, society would be better off without spam 
and viruses. Filtering software and monitoring software 
can be misused. If you are assigned to a project of 
questionable social value like the one in Figure 8-63, 
you might have to make an ethical decision about 
whether to participate or look for another job. 
Decisions pertaining to social responsibility are not 
always easy. Members of a project team might not be 
supplied with enough information to make value judg-
ments about the projects to which they are assigned.
Laws and court decisions sometimes conflict with 
regard to whether programmers and members of soft-
ware development teams are responsible for the way 
their software is used. In Sony Corp. v. Universal City 
Studios, the U.S. Supreme Court set a precedent that 
Sony was not responsible when individuals used Sony 
Betamax recording technology to make and distrib-
ute illegal copies of movies. When applied to the IT 
industry, the Sony case seemed to absolve software 
developers from any illegal actions taken by users. 
However, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act explic-
itly states that it is illegal to produce any product that 
allows individuals to circumvent copyright law or copy 
protection methods. Therefore, a programmer who pro-
duces software to crack Blu-ray copy protection can be 
held responsible when individuals use it to make illegal 
copies of Blu-ray movies. 
Court decisions aside, technology professionals have 
an ethical responsibility to use their skills to benefit 
society, rather than create products that may cause 
harm.

SECTION E, Unit 8
ETHICAL DECISION MAKING
Ethical decisions that you make on the job can have long-term conse-
quences for your career and lifestyle, so it is important to approach these 
decisions seriously. 
	How do I make ethical decisions? Take time to think about your 
situation before responding or taking action. As you examine the immediate 
situation, make sure you have a good handle on your long-term and short-
term career goals. Gather the information needed for a decision, and make 
sure the facts are credible. Use Web resources and legal services, if neces-
sary, to check applicable laws. 
With the facts in hand, list your options and consider the advantages and 
disadvantages of each one. For help in defining and evaluating your options, 
you can use strategies such as those listed below. 
Talk to people whose judgment you respect. Mentors and respon-
sible friends might be willing to help you evaluate your options. Your 
workplace might provide access to an arbitrator, an ombudsman, or a coun-
selor. Remember, however, that after you’ve gathered opinions and advice, 
you are ultimately responsible for the outcome of your decision. 
Consider what the most ethical person you know would decide to 
do. Think of a real-life person or fictional character who has strong values 
and impeccable ethical judgment. Use that person as your decision-making 
role model and ask yourself what he or she would do in your situation. 
Think about what you would do if your actions were made public. 
Ask yourself how you would feel if you made a particular decision and every-
one found out about it. Would you be proud or uncomfortable? Decisions 
that look good only if no one knows are usually wrong. When you’ve made 
a good decision, you should feel comfortable talking about it as long as it 
doesn’t violate confidentiality.
Look at the problem from the opposite perspective. Put yourself in 
the place of other stakeholders, such as your boss, your clients, or consum-
ers. How would you want to be treated if you were them? 
Consult a code of professional ethics. The guidelines contained in a 
code of professional ethics might offer a suitable path of action.
	What is a code of ethics? A code of ethics is a set of guidelines 
designed to help professionals thread their way through a sometimes 
tangled web of ethical on-the-job decisions. A code of ethics can provide 
guidelines, but it might not offer ready answers to every dilemma that arises 
in the course of your career. When confronted with a difficult ethical deci-
sion, you should consider ethical guidelines, but also consider the policies of 
your workplace and relevant laws.

	How useful are codes of ethics? Professional codes of ethics are 
not without controversy. For example, the code published by the Computer 
Ethics Institute has drawn fire from critics who suggest that it is too simplistic. 
One of the last points in the CEI code states that you should “Think about 
the social consequences of the program you write.” That statement is valid, 
but what should you think about? This guideline does not offer helpful crite-
ria for distinguishing between socially useful programs and those that might 
be damaging. When a code of ethics does not offer a complete solution, pro-
fessionals might have to refer to other resources before making a decision.
Some codes of ethics attempt to offer more complete guidelines. Such a 
comprehensive approach can be useful, but it can sometimes become so 
complex that it seems to contradict itself. For example, the Association for 
Computing Machinery Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct contains a 
guideline that begins, “ACM members must obey existing local, state, prov-
ince, national, and international laws unless there is a compelling ethical 
basis not to do so.” 
The code goes on, however, to offer a series of caveats that add complexity 
to the decision-making process: “...sometimes existing laws and rules may 
be immoral or inappropriate and, therefore, must be challenged. Violation 
of a law or regulation may be ethical when that law or rule has inadequate 
moral basis or when it conflicts with another law judged to be more impor-
tant. If one decides to violate a law or rule because it is viewed as unethical, 
or for any other reason, one must fully accept responsibility for one’s actions 
and for the consequences.” 
Ethical decisions can be difficult, and sometimes the results of those deci-
sion—good or bad—are not apparent right away. A decision with immediate 
negative repercussions might have beneficial long-term advantages that 
you cannot foresee. Ultimately, a decision about the right course of action is 
yours, and you must be willing to take responsibility for the consequences 
of your decision.

WHISTLEBLOWING
Shawn Carpenter was a network security analyst working for Sandia 
National Laboratories. He stumbled upon a massive intrusion into U.S. 
government computer systems carried out by Chinese hackers. When 
Carpenter revealed his discovery, he was told to focus on his job. Ignoring 
the warning, Carpenter contacted Army Intelligence and then the FBI. 
Sandia fired Carpenter, and he became one more person in a long line of 
whistleblowers who act with the best of intensions, but are penalized for 
their efforts. 
	Should I blow the whistle on unethical practices? A widely 
accepted definition of whistleblowing is the disclosure by an employee (or 
professional) of confidential information that relates to some danger, fraud, 
or other illegal or unethical conduct connected with the workplace, be it of 
the employer or of fellow employees. 
A whistleblower is someone in an organization who decides to speak out 
against on-the-job activities that are contrary to the mission of the organiza-
tion or threaten the public interest. 
	Is whistleblowing effective? 
Whistleblowers have focused public 
attention on corporate abuses at Enron 
and WorldCom. Edward Snowden 
made headlines in 2013 when he 
leaked information about covert gov-
ernment surveillance programs that 
violate the constitutional rights of citi-
zens. Whistleblowers also revealed 
major problems in the way the FBI 
investigated potential terrorists prior to 
9/11, and uncovered defects in the body 
armor supplied to the U.S. president 
and combat troops (Figure 8-65). 
	Can whistleblowing be dangerous? Although whistleblowing 
might seem effective, the consequences of whistleblowing can be extreme. 
Even with strong legal protection under the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, whis-
tleblowers are often fired or forced out of their jobs. If they keep their jobs, 
they might be excluded from promotions and shunned by coworkers. They 
are sometimes branded as tattletales and have difficulty finding other jobs in 
their career field. 
In extreme cases, whistleblowers have been forced to seek refuge from 
sympathetic foreign governments. They also may be subject to arrest, 
especially if the information revealed pertains to national security.
	Is there any way to safely blow the whistle on unethical 
practices? Whistleblowing is risky under any circumstances. For exam-
ple, a computer system administrator working for a state agency noticed 
his boss spent the majority of his time playing solitaire on his computer. 
After several email messages up the chain of command were ignored, 
the system administrator installed Win-Spy software, which grabbed 
incriminating screenshots of his boss’s computer over a period of sev-
eral months. When the system administrator showed this evidence to his 
superiors, he was fired for violating his boss’s privacy. His boss received 
only a light reprimand.

What is the major ethical 
dilemma associated with 
whistleblowing? 
a.	 The information revealed is 
usually confidential.
b.	 The information is true and 
harmful.

makes whistleblowing a 
federal crime.

As a whistleblower, the system administrator did some things right, but he 
missed some important measures that might have led to a more positive 
outcome. Employee advocates have the following suggestions for reducing 
the risk of career repercussions so often experienced by whistleblowers.
Examine your motives. Make sure your cause is significant. Don’t act out 
of frustration or because you feel underappreciated or mistreated. 
Try the normal chain of command. Before you blow the whistle, try to 
correct the problem by reporting up the normal chain of command. Consider 
every possible way to work within the system before you take your concerns 
public.
Collect evidence to back up your accusations. Gather documentary 
evidence that proves your case and keep it in a safe place. Do not break 
any laws while collecting evidence. Try to collect evidence before you draw 
attention to your concerns.
Record events as they unfold. Keep detailed, dated notes about events 
before and after you blow the whistle. Keep in mind that your notes might 
become public if they are used as evidence in a trial. 
Act ethically. Do not embellish your case, and do not violate confiden-
tiality agreements unless absolutely necessary. Engage in whistleblowing 
activities on your own time, not your employer’s. 
Be ready to accept repercussions. Think through the effect your 
actions might have on your family. Be prepared for unemployment and the 
possibility of being blacklisted in your profession. 
Establish a support network. Seek out potential allies, such as elected 
officials, journalists, and activists who can support your cause.
Consult a lawyer. Make sure you understand your rights as an employee.
Consider your strategy. You might reduce the risk of repercussions if 
you lodge your complaint anonymously or as part of a group. 
As with other ethical decisions, your resolution to become a whistleblower 
can have a long-term effect on your career, family, and lifestyle. Think about 
your situation carefully and make use of whatever resources are available 
to you.
1.	 Computer professionals sometimes have to 
make 
 decisions in situ-
ations where the right course of action is not 
clear.
2.	
Many aspects of law that pertain to computers, 
software, and intellectual property are included 
in the 
 Millennium Copyright 
Act.
3.	 Computer professionals know that it is impor-
tant to maintain 
 and 
privacy for data that pertains to individuals.
4.	 Computer professionals sometimes have dif-
ficulty evaluating whether a project is socially 
 because project team 
members might not be given detailed informa-
tion about a product’s application.
5.	 A(n) 
 is someone in an 
organization who decides to speak out against 
on-the-job activities that are contrary to the 
mission of the organization or threaten the pub-
lic interest.

Issue: patriots or traitors?
Julian assange. Edward Snowden. 
Thomas Drake. Do these names bring to mind 
heroes or villains? All three of these men are mod-
ern, digital-age whistleblowers who have been 
accused of espionage. 
Julian Assange is an Australian who, in 2006, co-
founded the international nonprofit WikiLeaks 
organization, which he heads today as editor in 
chief. WikiLeaks is dedicated to “providing an inno-
vative, secure and anonymous way for sources to 
leak information to our journalists.” WikiLeaks’ mis-
sion is to encourage transparency and ensure an 
avenue for freedom of speech and of the press. 
WikiLeaks has released several 
significant documents in recent 
years, ranging from video foot-
age of alleged civilian massacres 
to secret files about detainees at 
Guantanamo Bay. 
Assange has been under inves-
tigation by the United States 
government since 2010, when 
WikiLeaks published information 
leaked by U.S. Army soldier Chelsea Manning. The 
leaked information included 400,000 classified mili-
tary and diplomatic documents. 
Army investigators tracked the leaks to Manning. In 
sectors marked for deletion on Manning’s computer, 
investigators found chat sessions between Manning 
and a person at WikiLeaks suspected to have been 
Julian Assange. They also found an SD card con-
taining the leaked files. Manning was convicted in 
2013 for violations of the Espionage Act. 
Thomas Drake was a high-ranking senior executive 
for the NSA who was also accused of violating the 
Espionage Act. Drake was a member of an intelli-
gence team evaluating two information-gathering 
tools: Trailblazer and ThinThread. Drake favored 
ThinThread because it was less likely to violate the 
privacy of U.S. citizens.
When the NSA rejected ThinThread, Drake pursued 
his concerns using prescribed channels. When those 
channels proved fruitless, Drake released unclassi-
fied information about the two projects to the media. 
Drake insisted that any information that he released 
was not classified or sensitive information. 
In 2010, a grand jury indicted Drake on several 
counts, including violations of the Espionage 
Act. He had apparently collected evidence about 
project TrailBlazer and was accused of “willful reten-
tion of National Defense Information.” Under the 
Espionage Act, it is a crime to possess classified 
documents, even if they are not distributed. The 
charges were eventually dropped in 2011. 
A whistleblower named Edward Snowden made 
headlines in 2013. Snowden was a contractor 
who worked for Dell and Booz Allen 
Hamilton, which supplied computer ser-
vices for the NSA. Snowden became 
aware of the NSA’s global surveillance 
programs and decided to collect and 
release thousands of related classified 
documents that revealed how the NSA, 
foreign governments, and telecommu-
nication companies worked together 
to secretly monitor computer and cell 
phone communications. 
Snowden believed that it was his duty to make the 
public aware of what amounted to unauthorized 
and unconstitutional surveillance of innocent U.S. 
citizens. His revelations have led to discussion 
and debate about government surveillance and the 
appropriate balance between national security and 
privacy. Shortly after the documents were released, 
Snowden was charged by the U.S. Department of 
Justice with violations of the Espionage Act.
Today, digitization makes it possible for whistle-
blowers to collect an unprecedented number of 
documents and leak them globally. Consumers 
may applaud when whistleblowers reveal corpo-
rate misbehavior, but opinions vary widely about the 
appropriateness of whistleblowing that reveals clas-
sified government information. Can whistleblower 
revelations do more harm than good? Who makes 
that decision? Where is the balance between trans-
parency of information and public security?
“You can’t wait around 
for someone else to act. 
I had been looking for 
leaders, but I realized that 
leadership is about being 
the first to act.”

 ISSUE
TRY IT! Digital whistleblowing is a relatively recent issue. With the 
proliferation of the Internet and digitally stored information, whistleblowers 
can not only gain access to covert information, but can also easily spread 
this information over the Internet. Ironically, much of the recent prosecution 
against digital-age whistleblowers is based on the Espionage Act of 1917.
	 Since 2008, seven defendants have been charged with violating the 
Espionage Act of 1917. What are the names of the defendants? What 
type of information is each defendant accused of revealing? How 
many of the defendants were convicted?
	 Visit the WikiLeaks site at www.wikileaks.
org. Select an article and read it. 
Considering the date, source, and con-
tent of the article, explain why it is or is 
not significant. 
	 Go to the WikiLeaks About page at 
wikileaks.org/About.html to find out how 
WikiLeaks editors verify material that is 
submitted anonymously. What are the 
steps of the verification procedure? How 
does WikiLeaks protect anonymous 
sources? 
	 Look up Aldrich Ames, who was con-
victed of espionage in 1994. What type of 
information did Ames reveal? What was 
his motivation? Would you classify Ames 
as a whistleblower? Why or why not?
	 Whistleblower Edward Snowden made sure to identify himself as the 
person who was responsible for the release of NSA documents, and 
he publicly explained his reasons. Drake was also careful to identify 
himself and his sources and also explain why he released classified 
information. In contrast, WikiLeaks publishes material that has been 
submitted anonymously, so neither the source of the material nor the 
motivation for releasing it is known. 
	
Consider these two approaches to whistleblowing, and suppose that 
you are employed by the Internal Revenue Service IT department in 
Washington, D.C. Congress is investigating the possibility that the 
commissioner of the IRS conspired with the White House to audit 
organizations that were likely to make significant donations to the 
president’s opponents during the next election. You have been asked 
to delete all of the commissioner’s email messages from servers and 
backups. Would you consider becoming a whistleblower? If so, would 
you use a public or an anonymous venue? Explain your answer.

Information Tools: Provenance
5 8 4 	
Unit 8
If you’ve watched Antiques Roadshow, you know that the Beatles signed many album covers, which today are 
worth between $8,000 and $10,000. However, an album with the right provenance, such as the first American 
album cover signed by the Beatles before their debut on The Ed Sullivan Show, could be worth up to $150,000. 
The term provenance refers to the origins of an object and its history. It is commonly used in the antique 
business, but it can also be applied to printed documents and to electronic information including Web sites, 
photos, videos, and posts on social networking pages.
In the context of information, provenance provides clues that help you evaluate accuracy and reliability. 
Provenance also helps you track down permission to use and reuse articles, quotes, photos, videos, and 
music. The questions below can help you establish the provenance of electronic information.
Peer-reviewed information is 
usually found in scholarly sources, 
such as journals. Articles reviewed 
by topic experts before publication 
produce information that is typically 
accurate and backed by facts or 
research.
Public-reviewed information 
can be found in popular media, 
such as news magazines, blogs, 
and social network sites. Articles 
with comments made by read-
ers after publication are often 
opinionated, but can be useful for 
understanding divergent viewpoints.
Ratings are found on blogs, social 
networks, and commercial sites. 
Likes, stars, and other anonymous 
ratings have little meaning in the 
context of evaluating information.
• What is the top-level domain? Recognizing 
.edu, .com, .org, and other top-level domains helps 
to classify the person, organization, or business that 
is responsible for the site. 
• What else can the URL tell you? The Web page 
title or site name can help you identify whether the 
information is provided by a Web site, blog, tweet, 
forum, news aggregator, or social network post.
• Who sponsors the site? Check the site copy-
right or About page to determine who or what is the 
site sponsor. 
• What kind of resources are provided? Take 
an inventory of the objects (text, images, animations, 
videos, ads, links, comments, ratings) included and 
note those that are most relevant. 
• Has the information been peer reviewed? 
See the box below for a description of reviews.
• Are there ads on the page? Pay attention to 
peripheral objects, such as ads, because they might 
offer clues you’ll later use to determine the validity of 
information.
• Who produced the content? Look for the 
names of authors, photographers, designers, and 
others who produced content. Check their cre-
dentials by googling their names to link to their 
biographies, social pages, or other work.
• Did the material originate at the site? Was 
the material re-posted, republished, or retweeted? 
Redistributed material might be altered; you can 
refer to the original material to ensure its accuracy.
• Is the material a mashup or a derivative 
work? Stay alert for doctored photos and parodies. 
• Is the material date-appropriate? Check the 
date when the material was created or posted.
• Is there a contact link? Can you use it to get 
additional information or obtain permission to use 
content from the site?
• Are there access restrictions? Take note of the 
site’s access policy. Does it require a login or a paid 
subscription?

TRY IT! On November 29, 2010, the U.S. space agency NASA announced 
that it would hold a press conference the following Thursday “to discuss an astro-
biology finding that will impact the search for evidence of extraterrestrial life.” The 
announcement led to widespread speculation that NASA had discovered proof of 
extraterrestrial life. 
At the press conference, microbiologist Felisa Wolfe-Simon explained that her 
research team had isolated bacteria that could subsist on arsenic instead of phos-
phorus, which was considered essential for all terrestrial life forms. 
Although the announcement wasn’t as spectacular as receiving a radio telescope 
message saying “Hello, earthlings,” the idea that arsenic could sustain life rocked 
the scientific community and caused all manner of misunderstanding in the popular 
press. Had Wolfe-Simon’s team found some weird form of alien life? Readers who 
wanted reliable information about the discovery had to carefully choose their news 
sources. Let’s see how provenance can help separate reliable reports from sensa-
tionalized trash.
	 Use a search engine to find the original NASA press release by entering NASA 
Wolfe-Simon press release. Make sure you have the primary-source document 
by examining the URL. How does the press release define astrobiology?
	 The press conference was held on December 2, 2010. Search the Web and 
locate what you think is the most reliable source of the information that was 
presented at the press conference. Based on the provenance of the site you’ve 
chosen, explain why you selected it.
	 In the aftermath of the press 
conference, blogs, Twitter, and 
YouTube carried a full spectrum of 
commentary, from wacky “arsenic-
eating” conjectures of amateur 
scientists to very technical critiques 
from mainstream researchers. 
Search YouTube for a video that 
relates to Wolfe-Simon’s research. 
Watch the video, read the pub-
lic comments, and check the 
provenance of the video itself. Based 
on the provenance, explain how 
comfortable you would be including 
the information presented in a term 
paper. 
	 Wolfe-Simon’s research was imme-
diately criticized. An especially 
strong blog post from Rosie Redfield called it “Lots of flim-flam, but very little 
reliable information.” Find Rosie’s post and determine its provenance based 
on the criteria listed on the facing page. Would you characterize this blog as 
authoritative or wacky? Why?
	 On December 2, 2010, the Web site for Science magazine 
published a paper authored by Wolfe-Simon and members of 
her team. The article was later published in the print version of 
Science magazine. Find the article online and determine if Wolfe-
Simon’s paper was peer reviewed. What does the peer review or 
lack of it tell you about the validity of Wolfe-Simon’s claim that 
arsenic rather than phosphorus can sustain life?

Technology in Context: Banking
5 8 6 	
Unit 8
For most of history, banks used 
low-tech methods to track one of the world’s most 
cherished commodities—wealth. Checking accounts 
were in widespread use as early as 1550, when 
Dutch traders began depositing money with cashiers 
for safekeeping. The use of printed checks became 
popular in England in the late 18th century—so popu-
lar that banks found it difficult to process a steadily 
increasing stream of checks, including those drawn 
on accounts from other banks. 
An unverified story that has become part of bank lore 
describes the origin of a solution to the check pro-
cessing problem. As the story goes, a London bank 
messenger stopped for coffee and got to talking with 
a messenger from another bank. Realizing that they 
were delivering checks drawn on each other’s banks, 
the two messengers decided to exchange checks 
there in the coffee house. This event evolved into a 
system of check clearinghouses where representa-
tives from various banks met periodically to exchange 
checks and reconcile totals in cash. By 1839, British 
clearinghouses were annually processing in excess 
of £954 million of checks—equivalent to $250 billion 
in today’s money. 
Bank clearinghouses were described in an essay, 
On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures, 
written by computer pioneer Charles Babbage in 
1832. He also included a reference to the “possibility 
of performing arithmetical calculations by machin-
ery” along with a description of the Difference 
Engine, then under construction in his workshop. 
This dream of automated check clearing did not, 
however, become reality until more than a century 
later when S. Clark Beise, senior vice president at 
Bank of America, contracted with Stanford Research 
Institute (SRI) to develop a computer system to auto-
mate check processing. SRI completed a prototype 
in 1955 that used mechanical sorting equipment 
to queue up each check and MICR (Magnetic Ink 
Character Recognition) technology to read check 
numbers. In 1959, the first ERMA (Electronic 
Recording Machine-Accounting) system went into 
service. With ERMA handling calculations, nine 
employees could handle the job that once required 
50 people. By 1966, 32 regional ERMA systems 
operated by Bank of America were processing more 
than 750 million checks per year. ERMA and similar 
check processing technologies quickly integrated 
with bank transaction processing systems to become 
the bedrock of today’s banking technology.
Output from check sorting machines can be sub-
mitted to the Automated Clearing House (ACH) 
network, which offers a secure, batch-oriented data 
exchange system that can be accessed by financial 
institutions. On a daily basis, banks submit check 
data and receive a report of balances due to other 
banks. These balances can be reconciled by elec-
tronic funds transfer over the Federal Reserve’s 
Fedwire telecommunications network.
An upswing in check fraud during the 1960s made 
it increasingly difficult to cash checks at local mer-
chants. As an alternative to trying to cash checks 
at banks and local merchants, automated teller 
machines (ATMs) were first installed in the 1970s. A 
typical ATM connects to a bank’s front-end proces-
sor—a computer that maintains account balances 
for in-network customers and monitors suspicious 
activity. The front-end processor is separated from 
the bank’s main computer system for security. 
Some ATMs exchange data with the front-end pro-
cessor by using dedicated dial-up telephone lines. 
Other ATMs use always-on leased lines. Legacy 
protocols, such as SNA and 3270 Bisync, are being

replaced by the standard Internet Protocol (IP) that 
can be routed through more affordable connections, 
such as cable, ISDN, DSL, or Internet VPN. 
ATMs are expensive—about $50,000 to purchase a 
machine, install it, and operate it for one year. Banks 
have offset this cost by charging transaction fees and 
reducing the number of bank tellers. Once a prom-
ising entry-level occupation, bank tellers today earn 
less than $30,000 per year. Although tellers con-
tinue to accept deposits, process withdrawals, and 
cash payroll checks, they are increasingly pressed 
into customer service roles—opening new accounts, 
issuing ATM cards, resolving disputed transactions, 
and assisting customers who have lost bank cards or 
checkbooks. Despite this shift in job description, the 
number of bank teller jobs is expected to fall at least 
10% in the next few years.
ATMs offer access to bank services from convenient 
locations where customers shop, eat, and hang out 
with friends. The Internet takes banking convenience 
one step further and provides around-the-clock 
account access from PCs in customers’ homes, 
schools, and workplaces. Today, most banks and 
credit unions offer some type of online banking (also 
called home banking, Internet banking, or electronic 
banking). 
Basic online banking services allow customers 
to access checking account and bank card activ-
ity, transfer funds between checking and savings 
accounts, view electronic images of checks and 
deposit slips, download and print monthly statements, 
and reorder checks. Customers can also pay bills 
online by scheduling payment dates and amounts. 
Many credit card and utility companies offer e-billing 
services that automatically forward electronic bills 
to customers’ online banking accounts. For monthly 
fixed-amount bills, such as car loans, online banking 
offers automatic payment options that deduct funds 
from specified checking or savings accounts. 
For managing assets more effectively, online banking 
sites also offer sophisticated tools, including account 
aggregation, stock quotes, rate alerts, and portfolio 
management programs. Most online banking sites 
are also compatible with personal finance software, 
such as AceMoney and Quicken, so that transaction 
data can be shuttled between customers’ local com-
puters and their online banking services. 
A cadre of customer support personnel staff online 
help desks for customers with questions about online 
banking. Web masters, computer security specialists, 
and network technicians are also part of banking’s 
new job corps.
Online banking services are housed on a well-
secured Web server, and customers are not allowed 
direct access to the computer system that actually 
processes transactions. Customer privacy is main-
tained by the use of passwords and connections that 
encrypt data as it is sent to and from customers’ com-
puters.
Successful banks are built on good business deci-
sions. Bank managers are increasingly working 
with business intelligence tools to look for trends 
in customer behavior, analyze competing financial 
institutions, and examine current business practices. 
Tools for these activities include data warehouses 
that collect and organize data, data mining software 
that organizes and analyzes data in a meaningful 
way, and statistical tools that formulate comparisons 
and trendlines. 
Today, banking depends on multi-layered technolo-
gies that incorporate check processing equipment, 
transaction processing systems, business intelligence 
software, ACH networks, Fedwire, ATM networks, the 
Internet, and Web servers. Many banking practices 
originated from batch check processing, and only 
gradually have banks begun to move to more modern 
online transaction processing (OLTP) systems that 
store scanned images of checks and instantly update 
accounts when a purchase is made or a bill is paid.

Critical Thinking
New technologies are on the horizon. Digital 
books, self-driving cars, the Internet of Things, and 
3-D printers are just a sampling of technologies 
that may have considerable effects on lifestyles, 
employment, and economics. Which technology do 
you think will cause the most disruption in the next 
five years? Make a list of its potentially disruptive 
effects.
Group Project
Technology life cycles can be monitored using the 
digital product life cycle, Rogers’ bell curve, and 
the Gartner Hype Cycle. Work with a small group 
of students to select a technology—it could be a 
product, an innovation, or an idea—and then map 
it out on each of the three life cycle charts. Based 
on your mapping, what would you advise investors 
who might consider purchasing stock or participat-
ing in crowdsourced funding for the technology?
Cyberclassroom
Radio and television were once regarded as prom-
ising technologies for education. Can you find five 
innovative ways that educators proposed to use 
radio and television to enhance teaching and learn-
ing? Now, many educational innovations are based 
on Internet technology. Find five contemporary 
ideas for using the Internet within education. Can 
you identify characteristics that might make the 
Internet a more successful platform for educational 
initiatives?
Multimedia Project
Use the Web to locate information about an inter-
esting technology company. Now, suppose you are 
a recruiter for that company. Create a 10–15 slide 
PowerPoint presentation to show to college stu-
dents at a job fair. Make sure your slides contain 
substantive information presented in a quick-to-
understand format for students who are moving 
from booth to booth at the fair. Use photos to make 
the slides interesting and, since you are trying to 
capture student interest in a busy atmosphere, 
you might want to consider music or other sound 
effects, too. Follow your instructor’s guidelines for 
submitting your PowerPoint presentation.
Resume Builder
Successful job seekers strategize about how to 
get noticed by corporate recruiters. The direct 
approach is to send resumes in response to job 
postings and to establish a presence at online 
employment services. But do social media open 
additional opportunities? What can you discover 
about the way recruiters use social media? Do 
they frequent certain Web sites? Do they post pub-
licly on Twitter? Do they search LinkedIn? Gather 
a bibliography of links that contain hard evidence 
that recruiters use social media to locate potential 
employees. 
Globalization
With growing trends toward outsourcing, some 
economists are pointing to the emergence of 
“globalized professionals,” who are developing 
qualifications necessary to succeed in the global 
job market. For this project, use Web resources 
to conduct research about globalized profession-
als. Pay particular attention to the way this concept 
relates to your chosen career field. Using the 
information you’ve found, write a one-page paper 
outlining your thoughts. If the idea of becoming a 
globalized professional appeals to you, describe 
how you might enhance your qualifications. If the 
idea does not appeal to you, explain why.

Interactive Summary

Unit 8
SECTION B: Even before recorded history, humans used 
various 
 aids, such as pebbles 
and notched sticks, to keep track of quantities. By 1200, a(n) 
 calculator, called the abacus, had 
appeared in China. Devices such as the abacus require the 
operator to apply a(n) 
 to perform 
calculations. In contrast, 
 calcula-
tors, such as the Pascaline and de Colmar’s Arithmometer, 
are designed to carry out calculations autonomously. In 
the 1800s, an English mathematician named Charles 
 proposed to build a device, called the 
Analytical Engine, that would operate using steam power. 
The design for this device embodied many of the concepts 
that define the modern computer. In the 1930s and 1940s, 
several 
 computers were devel-
oped, including the Atanasoff-Berry Computer, Z3, Harvard 
Mark I, Colossus, and ENIAC. Most of these early computers 
used 
 tubes, which paved the way for the 
architecture of first-generation computers, such as UNIVAC. 
Second-generation computers were smaller and less power 
hungry because they used 
 . Third-
generation computers were even smaller because they used 
 circuits. The key technology for fourth-
generation computers, including personal computers, is the 
 .
SECTION A: Companies and businesses that create 
jobs, develop products, and offer services are classified into 
economic 
 . The 
 
industry encompasses those companies that focus on digi-
tal equipment, software, communications technologies, 
and related services. As in other industries, businesses 
in the information sector produce consumer goods and 
 goods. These goods may be pro-
duced in house or they may be 
 to 
other companies. Businesses also make extensive use of 
 when manufacturing, services, and 
product development are moved to other countries. These 
practices account in part for declining prices of digital prod-
ucts, but another factor is 
 law, which 
predicted that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit 
would double every two years. The life of a technology product, 
innovation, or idea can be tracked using a product life cycle, 
Rogers’ bell curve, or the Gartner 
 . 
Some technologies have transformative effects on lifestyles, 
employment, and economics. These 
 
technologies include digital photography, the telephone, 
and smartphones. Technologies also have an effect on 
 , which is the amount of output that is pro-
duced per unit of input. In theory, increased use of ICT can 
raise a country’s GDP. However, technology has also cre-
ated national 
 vulnerabilities, and the 
threat of cyberwarfare continues to grow.

Section C: The telecommunications industry initially 
used couriers to carry information from place to place. In the 
1800s, inventors created the 
 , which used 
electricity to transmit data over a distance. Signals were usually 
sent using 
 code. One of the biggest 
challenges for this technology was creating a worldwide network 
that linked continents. In 1858, this worldwide network became 
a possibility when the first undersea cable was laid across the 
 Ocean. Another telecommunications 
invention soon followed when Alexander Graham Bell managed 
to transmit human voice over wires. The telephone industry grew 
rapidly and is now classified as a(n) 
 car-
rier because it is similar to shippers that transport goods and 
passengers over regular routes at set rates. The telephone 
system infrastructure eventually became a key element of the 
Internet backbone. Radio technology emerged after the tele-
phone. Its ability to transmit sound through the air was the basis 
for several later technologies, including cellular phones. The first 
cellular phones that were able to access the Internet were avail-
able in 
 . Now, they are the most preva-
lent Internet access device, used in emerging nations as well as 
in developed countries. Television was an additional technol-
ogy to emerge in the telecommunications industry. Its evolution 
into 
 television provided another Internet 
access technology, especially popular in the United States. 
SECTION D: Tech sector careers can be defined in 
terms of a broad set of information, technology, and com-
munications industries, or more narrowly focused within the 
computer industry. A computer 
 is 
defined as any person whose primary occupation involves the 
design, configuration, analysis, development, modification, 
testing, or security of computer hardware or software. The 
IT industry encompasses a wide variety of jobs for computer 
professionals, and the career outlook appears to be relatively 
positive. Salaries and working conditions are quite favor-
able. Computer professionals work in full-time or part-time 
jobs, and some are 
 workers, who 
arrange to work for a company on a temporary basis, usually 
as consultants for particular projects. Although these workers 
are usually highly paid, they are not official employees of a 
company and are not eligible for company health care or retire-
ment benefits. Education is important to most high-tech jobs. 
Computer 
 degree programs focus 
on the design of computer hardware and peripheral devices. 
Computer 
 degree programs focus 
on digital computer architecture and how to program comput-
ers to make them work effectively and efficiently. Information 
 degree programs focus on apply-
ing computers to business problems. In addition to a college 
degree, 
 provides job applicants with 
marketable credentials pertaining to skills and knowledge of 
specific software or hardware. Finding a job in the IT industry is 
similar to finding any job. Preparing a resume is essential, and 
it can be supplemented by a Web 
 
with links to relevant Web sites, such as past employers, your 
alma mater, and samples of your work.
SECTION E: Computer professionals sometimes encoun-
ter situations in which the right course of action requires a deci-
sion based on evaluating what’s right and wrong. Professional 
 refers to on-the-job choices and actions 
that reflect a person’s values. Ethical decisions should take into 
account applicable 
 , such as the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act. Laws and ethics are not the same 
thing, however, and sometimes following the letter of the law does 
not result in ethical behavior. Situations that require computer 
professionals to make ethical decisions often involve software 
copyrights, privacy, conflict of interest, use of work computers, 
software quality, hacking, and social 
 . 
Ethical decisions made on the job can have long-term career 
effects. Many IT organizations have 
 of 
ethics designed to help computer professionals make tough 
decisions. Additional help in making ethical decisions can also 
be obtained from knowledgeable friends, mentors, lawyers, 
and workplace counselors. Computer professionals who are 
compelled to become 
 and speak out 
against on-the-job activities that threaten the public interest 
should understand the potential legal and career risks before 
they proceed.

 Polish your Experience section.
The Experience section is primarily used to record previ-
ous jobs, but it can also be used to showcase volunteer 
efforts or membership in professional organizations.
For students and recent graduates, jobs, internships, and 
experiences that contribute to developing career skills 
are appropriate here.
When entering work experience, be sure to correctly 
identify your job title, the name of the business, and the 
dates you were employed.
Try to phrase the job description in terms of PARS:
P - What was a problem or type of problem you worked 
to solve?
A - What action did you take?
R - What were the results? Did you succeed?
S - What skills did you develop in the process?
When you’ve worked for a business that is a LinkedIn 
member, its logo may automatically appear when you 
add it to your experience list.
 Add more sections to your profile.
In addition to Experience, LinkedIn offers other sections 
that you can add to your profile. If you already have a 
Summary section, skip to the next step.
a. Look for the “Add a section to your profile” link and 
click View More.
Sections such as Summary, Education, Skills, 
Organizations, Honors & Awards, Courses, and 
Certifications can be particularly useful for recent gradu-
ates.
b. Select the Summary section.
 Add pizzazz to your summary.
The Summary section is your professional bio. Aside 
from your headline, it is the most frequently read item on 
your LinkedIn page. 
The Summary content is limited to 2,000 words, but you 
can add photos, videos, documents, and presentations.
Consider these tips for an effective summary:
• Write in the first person (for example, “I’m always look-
ing for new problems to solve. Last year, our team 
tackled a complex...”).
• If you are job hunting, include keywords that are rel-
evant to the position you are seeking.
• Write to your target audience, whether it is recruiters, 
colleagues, or customers.
• Keep the tone professional, but friendly.
• Break the summary into several short paragraphs, 
and use bulleted lists for easy reading.
• Showcase your accomplishments, your values and 
passions, and things that make you stand out from 
your peers.
• Include statistics and other quantifiable information 
about your skills and accomplishments (for example, 
“For three years, I managed a $40,000 budget for the 
local chapter of ACM.”).
• Include testimonials from colleagues and supervisors, 
along with relevant awards.
• Add photos, icons, and other media. These can help 
draw attention to the Summary section and also show-
case additional accomplishments.
 Add your educational credentials.
a. Add an Education section if your profile does not yet 
have one.
b. Fill in the Education section for the school you are cur-
rently attending.
If your school is a LinkedIn member, the school’s logo 
may automatically appear when you click the Save but-
ton.
Use the +Add Education button to add more schools, if

“They have computers, and they 
may have other weapons of mass destruction.” 
When former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno 
made this statement in the late 1990s, she may not 
have meant that computers are weapons of mass 
destruction, but they are certainly powerful weap-
ons used by businesses to keep competitors in 
check. Computer-based information systems have 
spread rapidly and are now an essential compo-
nent of virtually every business, organization, and 
enterprise.

enterprise Basics
The multibillion-dollar fast food chain McDonald’s has a global strategy 
called the Plan to Win, which centers on “an exceptional customer experi-
ence—People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion.” The scope of the 
company’s enterprise is vast, and it can carry out its strategy only with the 
assistance of a sophisticated information system. 
	What is an information system? An information system col-
lects, stores, and processes data to provide useful, accurate, and timely 
information, typically within the context of an organization. The scope of 
an information system includes computers, communications networks, and 
data, plus people, products, policies, and procedures (Figure 9-1). 
Terminology
Although an information 
system does not necessarily 
have to be computerized, 
today most information 
systems rely on computers 
and communications 
networks to store, process, 
and transmit information far 
more efficiently than would 
be possible using manual 
systems. In this textbook, 
the term information system 
refers to a set of components 
that includes computers and 
communications networks. 
QuickCheck
“To provide an exceptional 
customer experience” would be 
a(n) _______________.
a.	 strategic partnership
b.	 information system
c.	 mission statement
d.	 enterprise
Figure 9-1: Information System Scope 
	What’s the official definition of organization? An organization 
is a group of people working together to accomplish a goal. Organizations 
have accomplished amazing feats, such as sending astronauts into space, 
providing live television coverage of global events, and inventing the Happy 
Meal. They also accomplish all kinds of day-to-day, routine tasks, such as 
offering banking services, selling merchandise, improving the environment, 
and policing neighborhoods. 
Any organization that seeks profit by providing goods and services is called 
a business or an enterprise. In contrast, organizations formed to accom-
plish political, social, or charitable goals that are not intended to accumulate 
profits are known as a nonprofit organizations. Information systems can 
support the goals and missions of for-profit enterprises as well as nonprofit 
organizations.
	What is a mission statement? Every organization has a goal or plan 
that’s referred to as its mission. All activities that take place in an orga-
nization, including those that involve computers, should ­contribute to this 
mission. 
The written expression of an organization’s mission is called a mission 
statement. A mission statement describes not only an organization’s goals, 
but also the way in which those goals will be ­accomplished.

SECTION A, Unit 9
	What kinds of enterprises can an information system serve? 
Just about any type of enterprise can benefit from an information system, 
from a small startup to an established multinational corporation. Information 
systems designed for a specific industry or enterprise may use vertical mar-
ket software. The software that controls touchscreen order entry at fast food 
restaurants is an example of software designed for vertical markets. Figure 
9-2 lists the ways in which information systems can help several kinds of 
enterprises monitor and improve their core business activities.
Education. Manage student records, maintain data on instruc-
tors and staff, handle course registration, and schedule courses 
and facilities.
Communications. Manage customer subscriptions and billing, 
track service area, contact customers with special offers, moni-
tor the network for outages, and track service and repair crews.
Health care. Manage patient records, deal with insurance 
claims, and schedule appointments.
Local government. Manage local tax compliance, improve 
financial management and reporting, maintain property records, 
and store employee data.
Manufacturing. Automate the design process; schedule sup-
pliers; track orders; manage inventory, sales, and shipments; 
and monitor safety.
Travel and hospitality. Provide an online platform for cus-
tomers to make reservations, schedule facilities and equipment, 
and schedule employees.
Retail. Operate point-of-sale systems in stores and online, pro-
cess payments, and maintain inventory. 
	How about horizontal markets? The core activities listed in the 
previous figure are unique to each industry. However, additional activities 
are common to many businesses. These common elements, which are the 
responsibility of horizontal market software, are listed in Figure 9-3.

	Who uses information systems? An information system is used by 
the people in an organization and its customers. You’ve undoubtedly used 
many information ­systems—for example, when registering for classes, 
getting cash from an  ATM, and purchasing merchandise on the Web. You 
might even work for a business or nonprofit organization where you access 
an information system as part of your job. 
Not everyone in an organization uses an information system in the same 
way. An information system must support the needs of people who engage 
in many different organizational activities. 
To coordinate the activities of employees, most organizations use a hierar-
chical structure. An organizational chart, such as the one in Figure 9-4, 
depicts the hierarchy of employees in an organization.

Figure 9-4: An organizational chart depicts the hierarchy of Employees 
	How are employees classified? In most businesses, employees can 
be classified as workers or managers. Workers are the people who directly 
carry out the organization’s mission. For example, they flip burgers, assem-
ble cars, write newspaper articles, sell merchandise, answer telephones, lay 
bricks, fix engines, or perform other types of labor. Workers routinely pro-
duce and collect data for information systems. For example, as checkout 
clerks ring up sales, their cash registers store each item in a database. 
Managers determine organizational goals and plan how to achieve those 
goals. They approve new products, authorize new construction, and super-
vise workers. Executive managers plan an organization’s long-range goals 
for profitability, market share, membership levels, and so on. This emphasis 
on long-range and future goals is referred to as strategic planning. 
Mid-level managers are responsible for figuring out how to achieve long-
range goals through sales, marketing, or new product development. They 
set incremental goals that can be achieved in a year or less—a process 
referred to as tactical planning. 
Low-level managers are responsible for scheduling employees, order-
ing supplies, and other activities that make day-to-day operations run 
smoothly—a process referred to as operational planning. Information 
systems can provide some or all of the data needed for strategic, tactical, 
and operational planning.

example of tactical planning?

SECTION A, Unit 9
	How do information systems help the people in an organiza-
tion? An information system can help people perform their jobs more quickly 
and effectively by automating routine tasks, such as reordering inventory, 
taking customer orders, or sending out renewal notices. Information sys-
tems can also help people solve business and organizational problems. 
One of the major functions of an information system is to help people make 
decisions in response to problems. According to Herbert Simon, who was 
well known for his insights into organizational behavior, the decision-making 
process has three phases, shown in Figure 9-5.
Phase 1: Recognize a 
problem or a need to 
make a decision.
Phase 2: Devise and 
analyze possible solu-
tions to the problem.
Phase 3: Select an 
action or a solution.

Figure 9-5: The Decision-making Process
	What kinds of problems need to be solved? All problems are not 
alike, but they can be classified into three types: structured, semi-structured, 
and unstructured (Figure 9-6).
Type of Problem
Example
Methodology
A structured problem is an everyday, run-of-
the-mill, routine problem. When you make 
decisions in response to structured problems, 
the procedure for obtaining the best solution 
is known, the objective is clearly defined, and 
the information ­necessary to make the deci-
sion is easy to identify. 
Which customers 
should receive over-
due notices? 
The information for this decision is usually 
stored in a file cabinet or computer sys-
tem. The method for reaching a solution 
is to look for customers with outstanding 
balances, and then check whether the 
due dates for their payments fall before 
today’s date.
A semi-structured problem has a known pro-
cedure for arriving at a solution; however, the 
process might involve some degree of subjec-
tive judgment. Also, some of the information 
regarding the problem might not be available, 
might lack precision, or might be uncertain. 
How many mountain 
bikes should a store 
stock for the holi-
days? 
The decision can be based on the previous 
year’s sales; but because future consumer 
spending is uncertain, determining the 
appropriate amount of holiday inventory 
might require some guesswork.
An unstructured problem requires human 
intuition as the basis for finding a solution. 
Information relevant to the problem might be 
missing, and few parts of the ­solution can be 
tackled using concrete models. If experts are 
presented with a problem but they disagree on 
a solution, it is likely an unstructured problem. 
Should Saks Fifth 
Avenue stock 
Japanese-inspired 
evening gowns?
The purchasing agent for women’s clothing 
makes this decision based on her intuition 
of customer taste and fashion trends.
	Can an information system solve all three types of prob-
lems? Traditionally, information systems contributed most to solving 
structured problems, but tools have emerged to tackle semi-structured 
and unstructured problems as well. These information system tools can 
be classified as transaction processing systems, management informa-
tion systems, decision support systems, and expert systems. Let’s look at 
each of these systems.

transaction processing systems
Information systems deal with data, and one of the most common ways 
to accumulate data is by recording every transaction that takes place 
within an enterprise. The volume of transactions can be mind-boggling. 
Salesforce.com handles more than 1.3 billion transactions per day. 
Amazon.com processes about 18,000 orders per minute. PayPal deals 
with about 18,000 transactions per second! 
	What’s a transaction? In an information system context, a 
transaction is an exchange between two parties that is recorded and 
stored in a computer system. When you order a product at a Web site, buy 
merchandise in a store, search for a term on Google, or withdraw cash from 
an ATM, you are involved in a transaction. 
	What is a transaction processing system? A transaction pro-
cessing system (TPS) provides a way to collect, process, store, display, 
modify, or cancel transactions. Most transaction processing systems allow 
many transactions to be entered simultaneously. 
The data collected by a TPS is usually stored in databases, and it can be 
used to produce a regularly scheduled set of reports, such as monthly bills, 
weekly paychecks, annual inventory summaries, and daily manufacturing 
schedules. Examples of transaction processing systems include payroll, 
accounting, inventory, point-of-sale, airline reservations, ecommerce, and 
billing. 
	How are transactions processed? Back in the days before credit 
or debit cards, shoppers could write checks and then head to the bank to 
deposit enough cash to cover them. Check writers enjoyed this grace period 
because banks operated batch processing systems. 
In the 1970s, early transaction ­processing systems, such as banking and 
payroll applications, used batch ­processing to collect and hold a group of 
transactions until the end of a day or pay period, when the entire batch was 
processed. Batch processing proceeds without human ­intervention, until all 
­transactions are completed or until an error occurs. 
In contrast to batch processing, most modern transaction processing 
systems use online processing—a real-time method in which each 
transaction is processed as it is entered. Such a system is often referred 
to as an OLTP (online transaction processing) system. Figure 9-7 illus-
trates these two types of systems.
Figure 9-7: Batch Processing compared to OLTP 
QuickCheck
Which of the following could be 
used to process payroll for a fast 
food restaurant? 
a.	 Batch 
b.	 OLTP
c.	 TPS
d.	 All of the above
Batch processing col-
lects and holds a series 
of transactions until 
a specified time or 
event, when all the 
transactions are then 
processed.
OLTP processes each 
transaction as it 
arrives.

SECTION A, Unit 9
	How does OLTP work? OLTP uses a commit or rollback strategy 
to ensure that each transaction is processed correctly. This strategy is 
crucial because most transactions require a sequence of steps, and every 
step must succeed for the transaction to be completed. 
Suppose you withdraw cash from an ATM. The bank’s computer must make 
sure your account contains sufficient funds before it deducts the withdrawal 
from your account and allows the ATM to deliver cash. If the ATM is out 
of cash, however, the transaction fails, and the withdrawal should not be 
deducted from your account. 
A TPS can commit to a transaction and permanently update database 
records only if every step of the transaction can be successfully processed. 
If even one step fails, however, the entire transaction fails and a rollback 
returns the records to their ­original state. The transaction will be recorded, 
along with data indicating where it failed. Figure 9-8 diagrams the processes 
that take place in a typical TPS. 
	What are the limitations of transaction processing systems? 
Although a TPS excels at maintaining transaction data entered by cleri-
cal personnel and online customers, its reporting capabilities are limited. A 
typical TPS generates detail reports, which provide a basic record of com-
pleted transactions. However, managers need more sophisticated reports to 
help them understand and analyze data. These reports are usually created 
by a management information system.

management information systems
Transaction processing systems handle the details of an enterprise’s core 
business. They record details such as airline bookings, point-of-sale pur-
chases, or bank card transactions. However, the detailed data that these 
systems accumulate can be overwhelming unless it is summarized, aggre-
gated, graphed, charted, or somehow formatted for human understanding. 
Early attempts to extract meaningful data from accumulated transactions 
produced management information systems. 
	What is a management information system? The term manage-
ment information system is sometimes used as a synonym for information 
system, basically referring to any computer system that processes data and 
provides information within a business setting. Today, this use of the term 
seems outdated. 
There was a time, however, when a management information system 
(MIS, pronounced “em-eye-ess”) was cutting-edge technology used to 
derive various reports from transaction data. Managers depend on these 
reports to make routine business decisions in response to structured 
­problems. As Figure 9-9 shows, an MIS is characterized by the production 
of periodic reports that managers use for structured and routine tasks. 
Terminology
The term management 
information systems (always 
in the plural) is the name of 
an academic degree program 
that focuses on the design 
and implementation of 
computer systems for solving 
business problems. These 
degrees are usually offered by 
business schools and require 
coursework in management, 
marketing, and other basic 
business disciplines in addition 
to courses about computing.
 
	What kinds of reports can an MIS produce? An MIS typically 
produces a set of summary and exception reports. A summary report com-
bines, groups, or totals data. For example, a summary report based on 
purchases at a McDonald’s franchise might show the total annual sales 
for each of the past five years. Summary reports are useful in tactical and 
strategic planning. 
An exception report contains information that is outside of normal or 
acceptable ranges. For example, a utility company’s MIS might produce 
an exception report showing a list of customers with past-due electric bills.
MIS reports usually follow a fixed format. For example, the past-due report 
for a utility company would have the same number of columns with the 
same headings every month—just the names of the customers and their 
overdue amounts would differ from month to month.

SECTION A, Unit 9
decision support systems
Telecommunication companies have a horrible reputation when it comes to 
service and repair. Customers who’ve taken a day off from work to wait for 
a service technician are understandably aggravated when no one shows 
up. Or what about the technician who shows up without the necessary 
replacement parts? Or the new guy who doesn’t have the expertise to fix the 
problem? IBM, Apple, and your telecom provider may have a solution, and it 
is based on decision support technology.
	What’s a decision support system? A decision support system 
(DSS) helps people make decisions by directly manipulating data, accessing 
data from external sources, generating statistical projections, and creating 
data models of various ­scenarios. A DSS provides tools for routine deci-
sions, non-routine decisions, structured problems, and even semi-structured 
problems in which a decision might be based on imprecise data or require 
guesstimates. 
One type of decision support system, called an executive information sys-
tem (EIS), is designed to provide senior managers with information relevant 
to strategic management activities—such as setting policies, planning, and 
preparing budgets—based on information from internal and external data-
bases. 
Decision support systems can also assist technical, professional, and cleri-
cal workers as they do their everyday jobs. IBM and Apple offer a series of 
DSS products called MobileFirst that puts tools for decision making on an 
iPad. The apps link to cloud-based information systems that gather data and 
provide decision-based analytical routines. Apps are available for bankers, 
police officers, case workers, insurance agents, flight attendants, pilots, retail 
sales associates, telecom technicians, and other occupations (Figure 9-10). 
Telecommunications repair technicians can use the Telco MobileFirst 
app to access work orders and load up their trucks with necessary 
repair parts. At the job site, they can connect to repair manuals or fire 
up FaceTime to interact with a supervisor.

	What are the components of a DSS? A decision support system 
derives its name from the fact that it supports the decision maker; that is, 
it provides the tools a decision maker needs to analyze data. A DSS might 
recommend a course of action, but the final choice remains the responsibil-
ity of the human decision maker. 
DSSs contain various components, such as decision models, query engines, 
and statistical tools. A decision model is a numerical representation of a 
realistic situation, such as a cash-flow model of a business that shows how 
income adds to cash accounts and how expenses deplete those accounts. 
These models may be similar to spreadsheet “what-if” scenarios. 
A decision query is a question or a set of instructions describing data that 
must be gathered to make a decision. Queries are handled by a query 
engine, similar to a search engine or the query module used to access data 
from a database. 
DSS ­statistical tools help decision makers study trends by summarizing, 
comparing, and graphing data that is produced by queries. 
DSS models, queries, and statistics can be based on data from an organi-
zation’s transaction processing system and additional data gathered from 
external sources, such as stock market reports, as shown in Figure 9-11. 
	What kinds of decisions can a DSS handle? A DSS can be used 
to tackle diverse problems because it contains a good selection of decision 
support tools. Directors of a disaster-relief organization might use a DSS to 
set fund-raising targets based on internal data from its accounting system 
and previous donations recorded by its TPS. 
A disaster relief DSS can also incorporate external information based on 
national fund-raising trends and current economic statistics pertaining to 
employment and disposable income. This data can be manipulated to exam-
ine what-if scenarios, such as “What if donations continue to decrease, but 
we are faced with another disaster similar to the 2011 tsunami in Japan?” 
	What are the limitations of a DSS? A DSS helps people manipu-
late the data needed to make a decision, but it does not actually make a 
decision. Instead, a person must analyze the data and reach a decision. 
A DSS is not a substitute for human judgment. When organizations want 
an information system to make decisions without direct guidance from an 
experienced decision maker, they turn to expert systems.

SECTION A, Unit 9
expert systems
Spam filters manage to prevent lots of unwanted messages from landing 
in your Inbox. The process of filtering out spam is based on an interlock-
ing set of rules. Expert systems also use rules to evaluate data and make 
decisions. These systems can then be applied to consumer applications. 
They can also encompass the business logic underlying the decisions 
made within an enterprise.
	What is an expert system? An expert system, sometimes referred 
to as a knowledge-based system, is a computer system designed to ana-
lyze data and produce a ­recommendation, diagnosis, or decision based on 
a set of facts and rules, as shown in Figure 9-12.
	Where do the rules come from? The facts and rules for an 
expert system are usually derived by interviewing one or more experts and 
then incorporated into a knowledge base. The knowledge base is stored 
in a computer file and can be manipulated by software called an inference 
engine. The process of designing, entering, and testing the rules in an 
expert system is referred to as knowledge engineering. 
	What kinds of decisions can an expert ­system make? An 
expert system is not a general-purpose problem solver or decision maker. 
Each expert system is designed to make decisions in a particular area or 
domain. 
An expert system ­created for use at the Campbell Soup Company cap-
tured the knowledge of an expert cooking-vat operator to help less 
experienced employees troubleshoot problems that might arise during the 
cooking and canning process. 
Other expert systems have been developed to watch for fraudulent credit 
card use, locate mineral deposits, diagnose blood diseases, underwrite 
complex insurance policies, order a customized personal computer, and 
recommend stock purchases. 
What happens when you 
turn the key to start 
your car? 
a. no response 
b. the engine sputters 
c. the engine sounds 
normal 
d. none of the above
Your response:_
RULE 1: 
IF you turn the key and there is no response, 
THEN the battery is dead and you should recharge the battery. 
RULE 2: 
IF you turn the key and the engine sputters, 
THEN you might be out of gas and you should check the fuel 
gauge. 
RULE 3:
IF you turn the key and the engine sounds normal, 
THEN the transmission might be malfunctioning. Check the 
position of the shift lever. 
RULE 4:
IF none of the above choices applies to the 
problem,
THEN the expert system will ask addi-
tional questions.

	How are expert systems built? Expert systems can be created 
with a computer programming language, an expert system shell, or tools 
included in business-oriented database applications. An expert system 
shell is a software tool containing an inference engine and a user interface 
that developers use to enter facts and rules for a knowledge base. An expert 
system shell also has tools for testing a knowledge base to make certain it 
produces accurate decisions. 
	Can an expert system deal with uncertainty? Expert systems 
are designed to deal with data that is imprecise or with problems that have 
more than one solution. Using a technique called fuzzy logic, an expert 
system can deal with imprecise data by working with confidence levels. 
Suppose an expert system is helping you identify a whale you spotted off 
the California coast. The expert system asks, “Did you see a dorsal fin?” 
You’re not sure. You think you saw one, but it could have been a shadow. If 
the expert system is using fuzzy logic, it will let you respond with something 
like “I’m 85% certain I saw a dorsal fin.” Based on the confidence level of 
your answer to this and other questions, the expert system might be able to 
tell you that it is 98% confident that you saw a gray whale. 
	How does an expert system work? When it is time to make a deci-
sion, the inference engine begins analyzing the available data by following 
the rules in the knowledge base. If the expert system needs additional data, 
it checks external databases, looks for the data in a transaction processing 
system, or asks the user to answer questions. Figure 9-13 outlines the flow 
of information in an expert system and summarizes its capabilities.

Ecommerce
Customers can place an order for a pair of shoes on Zappos.com and 
have them delivered the next day. How is it possible for Zappos to process 
an order, validate the payment, transmit the order to a warehouse, locate 
the correct pair of shoes, box them up, get them on a truck, transport them 
halfway across the country, and place them on your doorstep all in the 
space of 24 hours? It is the modern miracle of ecommerce. 
 What is the scope of ecommerce? Consumers usually think of 
ecommerce in terms of online storefronts such as Amazon and Zappos 
that sell various products to consumers, but the scope of ecommerce is 
much wider. Ecommerce refers to business transactions that are con-
ducted electronically over a computer network. It encompasses all aspects 
of business and marketing enabled by Internet and Web technologies. 
Ecommerce activities are classified as B2C (business-to-consumer), C2C 
(consumer-to-consumer), B2B (business-to-business), and B2G (business-
to-government), as described in Figure 9-14. 
Figure 9-14: Ecommerce classifications
B2C 
Online storefronts such as 
Zappos, Amazon, and Dell 
offer merchandise and 
services to consumers.
C2C 
Consumers sell to each 
other at popular auc-
tion and list sites, such as 
eBay and TaoBao.
B2B and B2G
Web sites such as FedBid, 
Oracle, and Ingram sell 
goods and services to 
other businesses or to 
the government.

services are offered at B2B

and browse the links to find out.  
Ecommerce sites sell a variety of goods and services. Physical products 
offered at ecommerce sites include clothing, shoes, skateboards, and 
cars. Most of these products can be shipped to buyers through the postal 
service, a parcel delivery service, or a trucking company. This type of ecom-
merce—similar to mail order—is regarded as the traditional model. Zappos 
fits neatly into this niche.
Many ecommerce sites specialize in digital products, such as news, music, 
movies, databases, ebooks, and software. The unique feature of these 
products is that they can be transformed into bits and delivered over the 
Internet. Consumers can get them immediately upon completing their 
orders, and there are no shipping costs. Amazon’s Kindle store represents 
this type of ecommerce, as does the iTunes store and Spotify.
Ecommerce merchants also peddle services, such as online medical consul-
tation, distance education, and custom sewing. Some of these services can 
be carried out by computers. Others require human agents. Services can 
be delivered electronically, as in the case of a distance education course, or 
they might produce some physical product, such as a custom-fit boat cover. 
Some online merchants sell across categories, providing digital products 
in addition to physical products. Some other merchants, such as Comcast, 
may even include services in their mix of online offerings. To manage their 
online storefronts, merchants use ecommerce applications.

 What is an ecommerce application? An ecommerce applica-
tion is the software that handles ecommerce transactions. Any enterprise 
that intends to have an online storefront will include an ecommerce appli-
cation as part of its information system. An ecommerce application helps 
customers find products, make a selection, and submit payment. A key 
component of an ecommerce application is an online shopping cart.
 How does an online shopping cart work? An online shop-
ping cart uses cookies to store information about a customer’s activities 
on an ecommerce site. Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, Web-based 
storefronts can’t easily track the items a customer views or selects. That 
information has to be stored where it can be accessed during checkout. 
The trend today is to assign an ID number to a customer, and then store that 
ID number in a cookie on the customer’s computer. As the customer shops, 
items that the customer views are stored along with the customer ID on the 
ecommerce site’s server. This enables the merchant to compile a profile of 
the kind of merchandise the customer is interested in.
Item numbers for the merchandise that a customer places in a shopping cart 
are also stored on the server. Even if the customer abandons the purchase, 
the items may remain in the cart. The next time the customer visits the site, 
the server can retrieve the ID cookie from the customer’s computer and look 
up the customer’s profile on the server. If it finds items in the cart, it can give 
the customer another chance to purchase them (Figure 9-15).

 How do online payments work? One factor that contributes 
to the amazingly fast order fulfillment at Zappos is a payment processing 
procedure that is virtually instantaneous. Zappos is not unique in its use 
of real-time transaction processing. Banking institutions make this service 
available to all ecommerce merchants.
Payment processing is based on an online payment gateway that autho-
rizes credit and debit cards, PayPal, and Apple Pay transactions. The 
payment gateway uses a secure connection to transmit customer payment 
data to a payment processor or financial institution where the payment can 
be verified. An authorization is sent back through the payment gateway to 
the merchant, which can then fulfill the order and submit a request for pay-
ment from the banking institution.
The merchant’s ecommerce application carries out only the first and last 
stages of the payment process. It collects the customer’s payment details 
on a secure form and then hands them off to the payment gateway. The 
approval process takes place outside of the ecommerce application, which 
then handles the last part of the transaction by confirming the customer’s 
order and sending out a status email. The entire payment processing rou-
tine shown in Figure 9-16 takes just a few seconds.

SECTION b, Unit 9
Supply Chain Management
Every online business runs an ecommerce application. This factor does 
not differentiate Zappos from merchants that take almost a week to deliver 
orders. One of the keys to Zappos’s speedy order fulfillment is the way it 
manages its supply chain. 
 What is a supply chain? A supply chain is the sequence of orga-
nizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving 
a product or service from supplier to customer. 
For Zappos, the supply chain includes vendors such as Cole Haan and 
Nike, shipping companies such as UPS, and warehousing facilities—a 
huge fulfillment center in Shepherdsville, KY, that stocks more than 3 mil-
lion pairs of shoes. The fulfillment center is located fewer than 20 miles 
from a UPS global freight hub, and orders are picked up hourly at peak 
times. 
Customer orders generated from the ecommerce system are transmitted 
to the fulfillment center, where robots gather boxes of shoes and carry 
them to packers. Packages are trucked to the airport, loaded on planes, 
transported to distant cities, unloaded at sorting centers, loaded on trucks, 
and delivered to customer doorsteps—all in fewer than 24 hours! (See 
Figure 9-17.) 
Figure 9-17: the Zappos supply chain
 What is the scope of a supply chain? Technically, a supply 
chain stretches from raw materials and parts all the way to customer deliv-
ery. The supply chain for a Zappos order includes shipping leather to the 
manufacturer, storing that material, and eventually forming it into a pair of 
shoes. 
Raw materials for a product are sourced and shipped to manufacturers. 
The speed at which those materials arrive affects the speed at which prod-
ucts can be manufactured as well as the cost of the finished product. If 
materials are delayed, manufacturing facilities sit idle. If an excess of raw 
materials arrive, there are costs for warehousing them. Inventory man-
agement is a business best practice that ensures the right amount of raw 
materials is on hand for the manufacturing process to proceed smoothly.
Zappos primarily sells finished products, so the manufacturing segment 
of the supply chain is a lower priority than the segment that stretches 
from the supplier to the customer. However, if a product sells out quickly 
and Zappos would like to sell more, the timeline for a manufacturing run 
becomes an important element in the supply chain. When Zappos custom-
ers see the message “Out of Stock, Notify me when this item is available,” 
the manufacturing segment of the supply chain may swing into action to 
obtain more inventory.

 What is the role of an information system in the sup-
ply chain? Supply chains are complex, so businesses use SCM (supply 
chain management) to maximize efficiency and profitability. SCM applica-
tion software is a key aspect of information systems used by manufacturers 
and retailers. The goal of SCM is to supply customers with the right product 
at the right price. Time is of the essence, but the price of transport is also a 
factor that has to be monitored and controlled.
Data for SCM is supplied by computerized or manual systems such as 
warehouse inventories, shipper logs and billing, supplier inventories, 
and manufacturing schedules. Those elements define the supply side of 
SCM. The demand side is also important, and SCM must take into account 
customer demand for products. Current demand can be quantified from 
customer orders, but astute managers understand that forecasting demand 
is also an essential part of having merchandise in stock and ready to ship. 
Data derived from demand planning and forecasting also plays a part in 
SCM.
 How effective is SCM? Take a look at some case studies of well-
known businesses to understand the effectiveness of SCM (Figure 9-18).
Terminology
Supply chain management is 
also referred to as logistics, 
though that term is somewhat 
less popular today.
Figure 9-18: SCM success stories 
QuickCheck
In which case studies are 
suppliers featured as a key 
component of the supply chain?
a.	 H&M, BMW, and Apple
b.	 H&M, Walmart, and BMW
c.	 Coca-Cola and Apple
d.	 Walmart and Apple
H&M is an upscale fashion 
retailer that designs its own 
merchandise and sells to 
online and in-store custom-
ers. The company relies on a 
network of nearly 700 sup-
pliers located in Asia and Europe. 
Merchandise is housed in a huge 
central warehouse in Germany, and 
from there it is shipped to local distri-
bution centers in different countries. 
H&M’s supply chain gets products to 
market in two to three weeks.
Coca-Cola is a worldwide bev-
erage corporation with 430 
distribution centers shipping 
to more than 2 million delivery 
points worldwide. The company 
uses vehicle-routing software to 
streamline delivery within the supply 
chain.
BMW’s 1,150-acre facil-
ity in South Carolina 
produces about 350,000 
vehicles each year. The 
automated facility was originally 
controlled by a data center in South 
Africa. Its just-in-time supply chain 
management coordinates in such 
detail with suppliers that the steer-
ing wheel for a black X5, for example, 
arrives from a supplier just as that 
vehicle is rolling down the line, and 
the brown steering wheel that’s next 
in the delivery van corresponds to 
the beige X3 that’s next in line. 
Walmart stocks products 
made in more than 70 
countries and sells them 
online in more than 11,000 
stores in 27 countries. A 
key element in Walmart’s SCM is 
cross docking, in which products are 
transferred from one truck directly 
to another without passing through 
a warehouse. Walmart’s informa-
tion system handles the tracking of 
inventory on each truck and provides 
instructions for unloading and trans-
ferring it.
Apple has been recog-
nized as having the best 
supply chain in the world. 
Apple’s strategy is to pur-
chase component parts for 
computers, iPads, and iPhones from 
suppliers all over the globe. Those 
parts are then shipped to manufac-
turing facilities in China. From China, 
devices are shipped to Apple Stores 
and cell phone retailers as well as 
directly to customers. Products 
ordered online are made to order. 
The maximum time to manufacture 
and ship each made-to-order device 
is about 15 days. To deliver devices 
for product launches, Apple leases 
Boeing 777 air cargo planes, which 
can each carry 450,000 devices.

offered to VIP customers. To attain VIP status, a customer can buy lots 
of shoes or apply for a VIP account. Customer loyalty programs such as 
Zappos VIP help attract and retain customers. In business circles, the gal-
axy of services that revolve around customers is called CRM. 
 What is CRM? The acronym CRM stands for customer relationship 
management. It refers to practices and technologies that companies use 
to analyze and improve interactions with customers. The purpose of CRM 
is to attract new shoppers, convert those shoppers into buyers, and turn 
first-time buyers into repeat customers. Figure 9-19 illustrates this basic 
CRM strategy.
 What are the elements of CRM? Businesses use a variety 
of strategies to enhance CRM. Some strategies focus on human fac-
tors, such as training customer service representatives. Other strategies 
depend on analyzing data gathered by information systems and analyzed 
by CRM application software.
As consumers, we don’t always understand the significance of loyalty pro-
grams, online chat, and other CRM techniques. Figure 9-20 provides a list 
that includes customer-facing CRM techniques and those that take place 
behind the scenes.

Terminology
The term customer facing is 
business jargon for systems 
that customers and clients 
interact with. The opposite of 
customer-facing systems are 
back-office systems, which 
customers do not see or use.

 What is the point of loyalty programs? A major source of data 
for CRM is produced by loyalty programs. A loyalty program or a rewards 
program is a marketing effort that provides customers with incentives for 
making purchases. Loyalty programs can offer rewards such as discounts, 
free shipping, notifications of sales, redeemable points, and airline miles. 
Simple loyalty programs use cards that get punched or stamped with 
each purchase. After filling out the card, a customer is entitled to a free 
or discounted product. Such simple programs were somewhat successful 
in encouraging repeat purchases, but businesses gained little else from 
them.
Computer-based loyalty programs store customer data in a database, 
which can be updated with customer preferences and a record of pur-
chases. Incentives can be tailored to each customer’s profile. Today, 
businesses are desperate for customer email addresses. Those addresses 
are used as customer IDs and provide a way to contact customers with 
information about sales and other incentives.
 How does CRM fit into an enterprise information 
system? In addition to data collected from loyalty programs, CRM appli-
cations gather data from several subsystems and deliver it to decision 
makers. For example, a technical support representative can be supplied 
with a customer’s invoices from the sales subsystem to determine whether 
a product is under warranty. 
CRM applications provide optimal information when they encompass 
customer support, marketing, and sales. Additional optimization can be 
gained when CRM applications mesh with ecommerce and payment plat-
forms accessed by customers, as shown in Figure 9-21.

SECTION b, Unit 9
enterprise Resource Planning
From the perspective of consumers, businesses such as Zappos that 
offer an enjoyable ecommerce experience along with speedy delivery 
and world-class customer service seem to run smoothly. But ecommerce, 
CRM, and SCM are just the tip of the enterprise iceberg that includes finan-
cial management, human resources, inventory, planning, communication, 
collaboration, and keeping an eye on the competition. Sophisticated ERP 
systems can integrate all of these enterprise activities.
 What is ERP? The acronym ERP stands for enterprise resource plan-
ning. ERP is a suite of software modules that integrate major business 
activities. In addition to sales, CRM, and SCM, ERP modules support 
business activities such as product planning, manufacturing, purchasing, 
inventory control, distribution, accounting, marketing, finance, and human 
resources. ERP systems can run on in-house hardware or in the cloud. 
Cloud-based systems are usually deployed as SaaS (software as a ser-
vice) with the business paying monthly or annual fees for its use. 
All of the modules in an ERP system use a common interface and a com-
mon database. Having a common interface means that various modules 
use similar controls. This is the same principle as the interface for mod-
ules in an office suite, such as Microsoft Office, which use similar ribbon 
bars and other familiar controls. Standardizing the interface for all of the 
modules in an ERP system shortens the learning curve and lets workers 
easily switch between multiple modules.
The use of a common database is one of ERP’s major advantages. 
Legacy information systems often had separate databases for each appli-
cation module. For example, data from customer invoices would be stored 
in one database, while the data used by sales representatives to contact 
customers would be stored in a different database. Using a common ERP 
database allows workers and managers to access and analyze data from 
multiple business units.
Information system software vendors sometimes describe ERP as “the 
central nervous system of an enterprise.” Figure 9-22 clearly shows how 
ERP connects major business units to a central database.

 What is the cost benefit of ERP? ERP systems are costly, 
but a well-planned implementation can produce significant competi-
tive advantages. A basic set of ERP modules costs about $50,000, and 
added expenses for planning, installation, cloud hosting, or in-house hard-
ware put the cost for a typical mid-size business between $150,000 and 
$750,000.
Implementation may also require a company to change some of its basic 
processes to conform to the ERP system workflow. Although customiza-
tion is possible, ERP software has a basic set of features that function 
according to accepted business practices. Businesses that deviate from 
those practices may have to restructure and retrain workers to effectively 
utilize the ERP system.
ERP systems streamline processes and information across an entire 
enterprise. They allow employees to do their jobs more efficiently by pro-
viding them with tools to access data as necessary from across business 
units. Warehouse workers, for example, can access order data directly 
from the sales and invoicing module, and they can access shipping infor-
mation from the procurement module. 
Managers and executives access the same modules, but rather than look-
ing at order and inventory details, they may apply analytics to gauge the 
profitability of products or measure the productivity of employees. In sum-
mary, an ERP system can provide the following benefits to an enterprise:
 

Improved overall performance by standardizing business processes based on 
best practices
 

Minimized technology overhead for managers and other workers who interact 
with a single, centralized, and integrated set of software modules

system development life cycles
If you’re a fan of home remodeling shows on the HGTV network, you’ll recall 
that the design team usually begins by looking at the house and asking the 
homeowners for a wish list. The designers then create a renovation plan 
and get approval from the homeowners before beginning construction. A 
similar process is used by IT teams that develop information systems. The 
overall process is called an SDLC.
	What is an SDLC? An information system progresses through several 
phases as it is developed, used, and finally retired. These phases encom-
pass a system development life cycle, usually referred to as the SDLC. 
Figure 9-23 illustrates a typical sequence of SDLC phases.
	Which phase comes first? A standard SDLC begins with the plan-
ning phase, and then it continues to analysis, design, implementation, and 
maintenance before the system is decommissioned and the planning for a 
new system begins.
The phases in an SDLC are not necessarily separate steps, however. An 
iterative SDLC can be used to create and implement a small subset of a 
system and then enhance it through a series of upgrades. Each subset 
has its own life cycle, which allows developers to focus on manageable 
parts of an information system, rather than tackle the entire system as one 
large project.
Iterative SDLCs are often referred to as “agile methods” because they 
allow flexibility as development progresses. Technically, agile methods are 
used for developing software, rather than entire information systems, but 
the two are intertwined. Using agile methods, a fully functional subset of 
an information system can be created, tested, and deployed. Then with 
user feedback, additional modules and features can be added for subse-
quent versions.
	How does the SDLC relate to systems analysis and design? 
The SDLC provides a general outline of how an information system evolves. 
Systems analysis and design is a discipline that focuses on developing 
information systems according to the phases of an SDLC. 
The scope of systems analysis and design encompasses the people, pro-
cedures, computers, communications networks, and software involved with 
handling information in an organization. It is much wider in scope than soft-
ware engineering, which is only one of the tasks that takes place during the 
development process.

SECTION c, Unit 9
planning phase
On HGTV, each renovation episode begins with a homeowner consulta-
tion. Renovators don’t just grab a hammer and start nailing pieces of wood 
together. It is important to have a 
plan. As with home renovations, initial 
plans for an information system are 
developed during a planning phase.
	What does the planning 
phase entail? The planning phase 
for an information system project 
includes the activities listed in Figure 
9-24. The goal of these activities is to 
create a project development plan. 
Before the project proceeds beyond 
the planning phase, the project 
development plan is usually reviewed 
and approved by ­management. This 
planning document includes:
• A short description of the project, 
including its scope 
• An estimate of the project costs and 
potential financial benefits
• A list of project team participants
• A schedule for the project, including 
an outline of its phases
	Who supervises the project? 
Depending on the scope of the problem and the expertise of the profes-
sional staff, an information systems project can be managed by an in-house 
information technology department or outsourced to a development firm. 
A system development project team, or project team for short, is assigned to 
analyze and develop an information system. The project team has a leader, 
sometimes referred to as the project manager, who supervises the project 
team’s work flow and output. 
	Who participates in the project? The composition of a project team 
depends on the scope of the project. Large and complex projects tend to 
have sizeable project teams, whereas smaller projects tend to have fewer 
members on the project team. Having more team members doesn’t nec-
essarily lead to faster completion, however. Research seems to show that 
when the team size exceeds nine people, productivity drops. It is interesting 
to note that U.S. government standards stipulate at least 32 people who 
must participate in every system development project. That number may be 
one clue to the high failure rate for federally funded IT projects. 
In addition to the project team, other members of an organization might be 
asked to participate in various phases of the project. A widely accepted tech-
nique called joint application design (JAD) is based on the idea that the 
best information systems are designed when end users and systems ana-
lysts work together on a project as equal partners. 
JAD provides a structured methodology for planning and holding a series of 
meetings, called JAD sessions, in which users and analysts jointly identify 
problems and look for solutions.

	What motivates organizations to invest in information sys-
tems? Information system projects may be designed to replace manual 
systems or replace obsolete computerized information systems. Information 
system projects do not necessarily reach across the entire enterprise. They 
may be undertaken to automate one department, such as when Zappos ini-
tiated a project to roboticize its warehouse operations. 
Information system projects often result from changes to business practices 
and as a response to new government record keeping, reporting, and com-
pliance regulations. 
The justification for information system projects usually emerges from a 
serious problem with the current system, a threat to the organization’s suc-
cess, or an opportunity to improve an organization’s products or services 
through technology. 
	What kinds of threats and opportunities affect organi-
zations? Most organizations exist in a rapidly changing and competitive 
environment, where many opportunities and threats can be effectively 
handled only by using sophisticated information systems. A well-known 
business analyst, Michael Porter, created the Five Forces model, shown 
in Figure 9-25, to illustrate how opportunities and threats can affect an 
organization. 
Figure 9-25: Michael Porter’s Five Forces Model 
Threat of new entrants
When it is easy for new compa-
nies to enter the market, each 
competitor gets less business. 
Example: iPhone apps are easy 
to create, so there are many 
entrants but little profit for each.
Rivalry among  
existing competitors
Because existing competitors 
are all vying for the same 
pool of consumers, each 
business must devise strate-
gies to offer better prices and 
service. 
Threat of substitute 
products or services
Demand for a product or 
service decreases when 
substitute products become 
available. Example: The avail-
ability of margarine reduces 
demand for butter.
Bargaining 
power of  
buyers
Buyers can get 
better deals when 
sellers offer compet-
ing products and 
when there is excess 
inventory or low 
demand. Example: 
New iPhone models 
are expensive when 
demand is high, but 
the price drops as 
demand decreases.
Bargaining 
power of  
suppliers
The price and profit-
ability of a product 
depend on the cost 
of raw materials 
set by suppliers. 
Example: Fuel prices 
vary based on the 
price of oil set by 
OPEC.

SECTION c, Unit 9
	How can an information system help an enterprise respond 
to threats and opportunities? To be successful in its mission, an 
enterprise must respond effectively to opportunities and threats. An enter-
prise has a choice of three fundamental responses: 
• Make improvements. An enterprise can become better at what it does 
by cutting costs, lowering prices, improving its products, offering better 
customer service, and so on. Information systems often provide ways to 
make businesses run more efficiently, and they can supply timely informa-
tion that helps improve customer service. For example, to better compete 
with other oil companies and take advantage of fluctuating oil prices, Hess 
Corporation installed an information system that coordinates instantaneous 
price changes to all its retail gas stations.
• Change the industry. An enterprise can change the nature of an indus-
try. Computers and communications technologies often make such changes 
possible. For example, Amazon.com pioneered the idea of selling books on 
the Web, which was a major change to an industry that sold books from mall-
based stores.
• Create new products. An enterprise can create a new product, such as 
flavored potato chips, or a new service, such as overnight package delivery. 
Although creativity and invention usually spring from the minds of people, 
information systems can contribute to research and development efforts by 
collecting and analyzing data, helping inventors create models and explore 
simulations, and so on. 
A new information system might be only one aspect of a larger plan to 
evolve an enterprise into a stronger, more competitive entity. The ­business 
community has embraced several business practices, summarized in Figure 
9-26, that use information systems as a key component for transforming 
organizations. 
BI (Business Intelligence): An integrated set of technologies and 
procedures used to collect and analyze data pertaining to sales, 
production, and other internal operations of a business in order to 
make better business decisions. 
BPR (Business Process Reengineering): An ongoing iterative 
process that helps businesses rethink and radically redesign 
practices to improve performance, as measured by cost, quality, 
service, and speed.
JIT (Just In Time): A manufacturing system in which the parts 
needed to construct a finished product are produced or arrive at 
the assembly site just when they are needed. JIT tends to reduce 
costs by eliminating substantial warehousing expenses and obso-
lete parts. 
MRP (Manufacturing Resource Planning): Calculates and main-
tains an optimum manufacturing plan based on master production 
schedules, sales forecasts, inventory status, open orders, and 
invoices. If properly implemented, it improves cash flow and 
increases profitability. MRP provides businesses with the ability 
to be proactive rather than reactive for the management of their 
inventory levels and material flow. 
TQM (Total Quality Management): A technique initiated by top 
management that involves all employees and all departments, 
and focuses on quality assurance in every product and service 
offered to customers.

	How does the project team identify problems and oppor-
tunities? Justifying a project often involves identifying problems and 
opportunities within an organization’s current information system. By elimi-
nating problems and taking advantage of opportunities, an organization can 
become more competitive. 
Project team members can identify problems and opportunities using a 
variety of techniques, such as interviews and data analysis. For example, 
James Wetherbe’s PIECES framework helps classify problems in an infor-
mation ­system. Each letter of PIECES stands for a potential problem, as 
shown in Figure 9-27.
Information
A n  i n fo r m a t i o n 
problem means that 
users don’t receive 
the right informa-
tion at the right time 
in a usable format.
Control
A control problem means 
that information is avail-
able to unauthorized 
users or that authorized 
users are not given the 
authority to make deci-
sions based on the 
information they receive.
Efficiency
An efficiency problem 
means that too many 
resources are used 
to collect, process, 
store, and distribute 
information.
Service
A service problem 
means that the sys-
tem is too difficult or 
inconvenient to use.
Economics
An economics problem 
means that the sys-
tem costs too much to 
operate or use. 
	What is a system development methodology? As part of the 
planning phase, the project team selects one or more methodologies that 
provide structure for the development effort. Earlier, you learned that the 
SDLC delineates the phases of system development. 
A system development methodology specifies what takes place in each 
phase; it encompasses the activities, procedures, methods, best prac-
tices, deliverables, and automated tools that system developers follow to 
complete the SDLC. In short, a system development methodology guides 
developers through the phases of system development.
There are many standard system development methodologies. Structured 
methodology focuses on the processes that take place within an informa-
tion system. Information engineering ­methodology focuses on the data 
an information system collects before working out ways to process that 
data. Object-oriented methodology treats an information system as a col-
lection of objects that interact to accomplish tasks.

	How is the project schedule developed? Project management 
software is an effective tool for planning and scheduling. It helps manag-
ers track and visualize the complex interactions between tasks. Popular 
project management offerings include open source software such as Open 
Workbench and commercial software such as Microsoft Project.
Project scheduling begins in the planning phase, but it stretches through-
out the entire project. Project managers organize the work into tasks and 
milestones, which can be scheduled and assigned. As tasks are com-
pleted, the schedule is updated and adjusted. Industry standard tools 
for scheduling and project management include PERT, WBS, and Gantt 
charts (Figure 9-28).

PERT 
PERT (Pro­gram Evaluation 
and Review Technique) 
is a method for analyzing 
the time needed to com-
plete each project task and 
identify the minimum time 
needed to complete the 
total project. A PERT dia-
gram uses arrows to map 
the sequence of tasks in a 
project. The critical path 
indicates the shortest time 
to complete all tasks.
WBS
A WBS (work breakdown struc-
ture) breaks a complex task 
into a series of subtasks. The 
hierarchy of tasks can be shown 
as a hierarchical diagram, but 
it can also be formatted as a 
simple outline. A WBS can be 
activity oriented to list tasks 
or deliverable oriented to list 
project milestones. 
Gantt charts 
A Gantt chart uses bars to 
show the duration of develop-
ment tasks as they occur over 
time. Each bar on the chart 
represents a task; the length 
of a bar indicates the task’s 
expected duration.

analysis phase
On HGTV, the planning phase ends after the homeowners reveal their wish 
list and budget. In the next segment of the show, the design team looks at 
the house to figure out how many items on the wish list are possible within 
time and budget limits. A similar routine takes place during the analysis 
phase of the SDLC.
	What is the purpose of the analy-
sis phase? The planning phase of the SDLC 
ends after the project team selects a devel-
opment methodology, draws up the project 
development plan, and receives permission 
from management to proceed. The goal of 
the analysis phase is to produce a list of 
requirements for a new or revised informa-
tion system. Tasks for the analysis phase are 
listed in Figure 9-29.
	Why study the current system? Most 
new information ­systems are designed to 
replace a system or process that is already 
in place. It is important to study the current 
system to understand its strengths and weak-
nesses before designing a new system. 
	How does the project team discover 
what happens in the current system? 
Some members of the project team might 
have first-hand experience with the current 
system. They can often provide an overview of the system and identify key 
features, strengths, and weaknesses. To obtain additional ­information about 
the current system, project team members can observe the system in action 
and interview people who use it. 
	How does the project team determine what the new system 
should do? System requirements are the criteria for successfully solv-
ing problems identified in an information system. These requirements guide 
the design and implementation for a new or updated information system. 
They also serve as an evaluation checklist at the end of the development 
project; because of this, they are sometimes called success factors. A new 
or updated information system should always meet requirements defined by 
the project team. 
The project team determines requirements by interviewing users and study-
ing ­successful information systems that solve problems similar to those in 
the current system. Another way to determine requirements is to construct 
a prototype as a trial version of an information system. Often the prototype 
is not a fully functioning system because it is designed to demonstrate only 
selected features that might be incorporated into a new information system. 
A systems analyst shows the prototype to users, who evaluate which fea-
tures of the prototype are important for the new information system. 
	What does the project team do with system requirements? 
After the project team studies the current system and then determines what 
the new system should do, system requirements are incorporated into a 
document called a system requirements report that describes the objec-
tives for the information system.

SECTION c, Unit 9
documentation tools
A picture is worth a thousand words. That is the philosophy of systems ana-
lysts, who prefer to diagram the structure of an information system, rather 
than describe it in words. Using diagrams is far more efficient than pages 
and pages of text, though clear narrative writing is also an important tool in 
the systems analyst’s toolbox. 
	How does the project team document system requirements? 
The system requirements report is one of the most important products of 
the SDLC. It documents key business practices in the current system and 
contains a list of success factors for a new or updated information system. If 
these factors have not been correctly identified, the information system will 
be a failure. The systems requirement report must contain clear, complete, 
and detailed documentation, including diagrams and descriptions.
The project team can use a variety of tools to diagram the current system 
and produce documentation that is also useful in later phases of the SDLC. 
Documentation tools vary according to development methodology. For 
example, a project team following a structured methodology will use different 
documentation tools than a project team using object-oriented methodology. 
To understand some of the most popular documentation tools, consider a 
project to develop an information system for a for-profit organization that 
offers business seminars and workshops throughout the world. The new 
information system must keep track of workshop schedules and student 
enrollments. Students have to be able to select workshops, and instructors 
must be supplied with a roster of students.
	What are structured documentation tools? The core documenta-
tion tool for project teams using structured methodology is the data flow 
diagram (DFD), which graphically illustrates how data moves through an 
information system. 
You can think of a DFD as a map that traces the possible paths for data 
traveling from entities (such as students) to processes (such as enrolling in 
a workshop) or storage areas (such as databases). In DFD ­terminology, an 
external entity is a person, an organization, or a device outside the informa-
tion system that originates or receives data. A data store is a filing cabinet, 
disk, or tape that holds data. A process is a manual or computerized routine 
that changes data by performing a calculation, updating information, sorting 
a list, and so on. An arrow symbolizes a data flow and indicates how data 
travels from entities to processes and data stores. Each of these elements is 
represented on a DFD by a symbol, as shown in Figure 9-30.
An external entity 
is represented by 
a square labeled 
with a noun.
A process is rep-
resented by a 
rounded rectangle, 
which is numbered 
and labeled with a 
verb phrase. 
A data store is 
represented by 
an open rectangle 
labeled with the 
name of a data file.
A data flow is 
represented by an 
arrow labeled with 
a description of 
the data.

	What does a DFD look like? In a completed DFD, data flow arrows 
show the path of data to and from external entities, data stores, and pro-
cesses. Figure 9-31 explains how to read a DFD.
To read a DFD, begin at any one of the square entities and follow the arrows to trace the flow 
of data. The label on each data flow arrow identifies the data that moves through the system. 
Arrows moving into a process indicate input data. Arrows that emerge from a process show out-
put. Rectangular data stores represent data that is stored in databases.

	How do documentation tools differ for 
object-oriented analysis and design? Structured 
documentation tools such as DFDs help analysts decide 
how to design databases and write ­applications that allow 
people to interact with those databases. In contrast, object-
oriented design tools provide blueprints for creating data 
objects and the routines that allow people to interact with 
those objects. The current standard for object-oriented 
documentation is referred to as UML (Unified Modeling 
Language). Three of the most frequently used UML tools 
include use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, and class 
diagrams.
	What is a use case diagram? A use case diagram 
documents the users of an information system and the func-
tions they perform. In object-oriented jargon, the people 
who use the system are called actors. Any task an actor 
performs is called a use case. Figure 9-32 shows a simple 
use case diagram for a workshop registration system.

SECTION c, Unit 9
	What is the composition of an object? A key element of object-
oriented development is defining objects. In the registration example, a 
student interacts with two objects: a Workshop object and a Section object. 
A class diagram provides the name of each object, a list of each object’s 
attributes, a list of methods, and an indication of the associations between 
objects. An attribute is simply any data element that is stored as part of an 
object. A method is any behavior that an object is capable of ­performing. 
You’ll find detailed definitions of object-oriented terms, such as classes, 
attributes, and methods, in Unit 11. Figure 9-33 illustrates a class diagram 
for the workshop registration system.

workshop sections. Figure 9-34 shows a sequence diagram for the Enroll

	Are diagramming tools computerized? Maintaining documen-
tation can become a complex task as the project progresses and system 
requirements are revised. A CASE tool (computer-aided software engi-
neering tool) is a software application designed for documenting system 
requirements, diagramming current and proposed information systems, 
scheduling development tasks, and developing computer programs. 
Commercial CASE tools such as Visible Analyst and open source tools 
such as ArgoUML automate many of the routine housekeeping tasks 
required for systems analysis and design, such as changing the name of 
a data element on one diagram and making sure the change is reflected in 
other diagrams and program code. Figure 9-35 explains some of the fea-
tures of CASE tools.
CASE software tracks variables, 
attributes, and methods to ensure 
that they are used consistently.
CASE software provides 
tools for diagramming.
Tools also help analysts iden-
tify errors and omissions in 
their documentation.

design phase 
Let’s look back at our HGTV example for a moment. After figuring out what 
the homeowners need and can afford, the designers get to work creat-
ing a blueprint and selecting materials for the new design. Their goal is to 
figure out the location for cabinets, closets, appliances, and structural ele-
ments, while ensuring that furniture can fit comfortably within the floor plan. 
As each element is placed in the floor plan, the design for the renovation 
begins to emerge. This process is a useful analogy for what happens dur-
ing the design phase of the SDLC, as you will discover in this section.
	What happens in the design phase? In the analysis phase, the 
project team determines what the new information system must do. In the 
design phase of the SDLC, the project team must figure out how the new 
system will fulfill the requirements specified in the system requirements 
report. The activities that normally take place during the design phase for an 
information system are listed in Figure 9-36.

	How does the project team come up with solutions? There 
might be more than one way to solve the problems and meet the require-
ments identified in the analysis phase of the SDLC. Some potential solutions 
might be better than others. They might be more effective, less costly, or 
less complex. Therefore, it is typically not a good idea to proceed with the 
first solution that comes to mind. The project team should instead identify 
several potential hardware and software solutions by brainstorming and 
researching case studies.

SECTION d, Unit 9
	What kinds of hardware solutions are available? A myriad of 
hardware options are available for information systems. The project team 
has to consider the overall architecture based on device requirements, 
network technology, cloud hosting, and level of automation.
Device requirements. Servers and personal computers are the most 
commonly used components in information systems, but handheld 
devices, mainframes, and even supercomputers can also play a role. 
Systems analysts have to consider if users will be accessing the system at 
the office or in the field. How much mobility is required? How much process-
ing power and storage are required? Will screen size be an issue? These 
are some of the hardware questions that will be answered in the design 
phase.
Network technology. An information system, by its very nature, is 
designed to serve an entire organization. That organization includes many 
people who work in different rooms, different buildings, and perhaps even 
different countries. 
Virtually every information system requires a network, so the project team 
must examine network alternatives, such as LANs, extranets, intranets, 
and the Internet. Many information systems require a complex mixture of 
networks, such as a LAN in each branch office connected to a company 
intranet, with customers accessing selected data via the Internet.
Cloud hosting. The availability of cloud services offers yet another hard-
ware option that can be addressed during the design phase. Rather than 
install an information system on costly in-house equipment, a viable alter-
native might be to install it in the cloud on equipment that is maintained by 
a cloud hosting company such as Amazon.com, Microsoft, or Google.
Level of automation. The project team should consider the pros and 
cons of different levels of automation because they affect all aspects of 
the planned information system. A point-of-sale system with a low level of 
automation might require the checkout clerk to enter credit card numbers 
from a keypad. 
At a higher level of automation, a magnetic strip reader automates the 
process of entering a credit card number. A further level of automation is 
achieved by using a pressure-sensitive digitizing pad and stylus to collect 
­customer signatures. Even more automation can be achieved with “tap-
and-pay” systems, such as Apple Pay (Figure 9-37).

	What kinds of software solutions are available? The project 
team might ­consider software alternatives, such as whether to construct 
the system from scratch with programming tools, use an application devel-
opment tool, purchase application software, or select a turnkey system 
(Figure 9-38). 
Turnkey systems. A turnkey system is essentially 
an “information system in a box,” which consists of 
hardware and application software designed to offer 
a complete information system solution. These solu-
tions may be designed for in-house installations or 
as cloud-based systems.
In terms of the cake analogy, a turnkey system is like 
going out to dinner and simply ordering your choice 
of cake for dessert. 
A turnkey system might seem like a quick and easy 
solution, and it looks attractive to many project 
teams. Like application software, however, a turnkey 
system must be extensively evaluated to determine 
whether it can satisfy system requirements.
Application software. Application software for an 
information system is usually a series of prepro-
grammed software modules supplied by a software 
publisher. 
Application software eliminates much of the design 
work required with programming languages or appli-
cation development tools. However, application 
­software requires extensive evaluation to determine 
how well it meets the system requirements. Following 
through with the cake analogy, application software is 
equivalent to buying a pre-made cake that you simply 
slice and serve. 
Application software is available for standard business 
functions, such as human resources management, 
accounting, ecommerce, CRM, and SCM. It is also 
available for many vertical market businesses and 
organizations, such as law offices, schools, medical 
offices, libraries, churches, and charities. 
Although most application software has some cus-
tomization options, in many cases, it cannot be 
modified to exactly meet every system requirement, 
which necessitates adjustments in an organization’s 
procedures. The project team must decide if the ben-
efits of application software can offset the cost and 
inconvenience of procedural changes.
Application development tools. An application devel-
opment tool is essentially a software construction kit 
containing building blocks that can be assembled into 
a software product. Application development tools 
include expert system shells and database manage-
ment systems.
An application development tool is the programmer’s 
“cake mix,” which contains many of the ­ingredients 
necessary for quickly and easily developing the mod-
ules for an information system. Although application 
development tools usually speed up the development 
process, they might not offer the same level of flex-
ibility as a programming language. 
Programming tools. Creating an information system 
from scratch using a programming language can take 
many months or even years. It is usually costly, but 
it offers the most flexibility for achieving the system 
requirements. 
As an analogy, baking a cake from scratch allows you 
some flexibility in the ingredients you choose—mar-
garine instead of shortening, for example. However, 
baking from scratch requires a lot of time and work 
to sift the flour; mix the sugar, eggs, shortening, and 
milk; and so forth. 
The project team can analyze the costs and benefits 
of developing an information system from scratch. If 
it appears to be a feasible solution, the team can also 
select a programming language to use.

evaluation and selection
The drama depicted on HGTV inevitably involves a choice between 
designs—usually over a commercial break. There are also choices in 
an information system project, and there is a structured methodology for 
making those choices.
	How does the team choose the best solution? The project 
team devises a list of criteria for comparing each potential solution. This list 
includes general criteria related to costs, benefits, and development time. 
The list also includes technical criteria, such as the flexibility of the solu-
tion and its adaptability for future modifications and growth. Finally, the list 
includes functional ­criteria that indicate how well the solution satisfies the 
specified requirements. Using a decision support worksheet, the proj-
ect team can assign scores to each criterion, weight them, and compare 
totals for all solutions (Figure 9-39).
	How does the project team find the right hardware and 
software for the new information system? After the project 
team selects a solution, the next task is to select the hardware and software 
needed to implement the solution. Sometimes more than one vendor sells 
the hardware and software necessary for the new system, so an organiza-
tion might have a choice of vendors. 
The method for selecting the hardware, software, and vendor depends 
on the project team’s understanding of what is required for the solution. 
Sometimes the team knows exactly what brand, model, or version of hard-
ware and software are required. At other times, the team has a general 
understanding but needs help from vendors to select specific products. 
The project team should consider the vendor’s reliability, expertise, and 
financial stability. Technical criteria for hardware might include processing 
speed, reliability, upgradability, maintenance costs, and warranty. Technical 
criteria for software might include reliability, compatibility, and the availability 
of patches to fix program errors.

application specifications
By selecting a solution, the design team has decided on a basic course of 
action, but there are details to be worked out before construction begins. 
On HGTV, this phase takes place behind the scenes as architects create 
detailed blueprints and contractors obtain permits. On an information sys-
tem project, the team is now at a crossroad. It may proceed to a detailed 
design phase, or it may head to the next phase of the SDLC.
	What happens after the project team selects a solution? 
Exactly what happens next in the system design phase depends on the type 
of solution selected. If a turnkey ­solution is selected, the next step might be 
to get approval to move into the implementation phase of the SDLC. 
In contrast, if the project team selects a solution that requires custom pro-
gramming, the team’s systems analysts will create a set of application 
specifications that describe the way the information system’s software 
should interact with users, store data, process data, and format reports. 
Detailed application specifications can be developed only after selecting the 
hardware and software for an information system. For example, the speci-
fications for a program that runs on a Windows-based LAN might require a 
very different user interface and processing model than a program that runs 
on an application server that is accessed via the Internet. 
This part of the SDLC is sometimes referred to as the detailed design 
phase because its goal is to create very detailed specifications for the com-
pleted information system, such as a detailed description of the process for 
discontinuing an inventory item in Figure 9-40.

SECTION D, Unit 9
	What is the importance of application specifications? 
Application specifications are a key element in developing an effective infor-
mation system. Not only do these specifications serve as a blueprint for the 
new system, but they play a critical role in ensuring that the development 
process is executed efficiently.
Some projects fail because of constant, unmanaged demand for changes, 
even before the system is implemented. This failure to constrain change is 
often referred to as feature creep because new features tend to creep into 
the development process with a snowball effect that leads to other features, 
higher costs, and longer schedules. 
It might be important to change some specifications during the develop-
ment process because of changes in business needs, laws, or regulations. 
Proposed changes should be managed within a formal process that includes 
written change requests, which detail the scope of a proposed change and 
can be evaluated by project team members (Figure 9-41). 
	What happens to the completed specifications? Application 
specifications are similar to the pages of an architectural blueprint that show 
the detailed plan for electrical wiring or plumbing. The specifications are 
given to a programming team or an application developer who creates the 
software. 
	When can the project team actually begin to build the new 
information system? In the design phase of the SDLC, the project team 
chooses a solution, selects hardware and software, and designs detailed 
application specifications. Before the solution is implemented, the project 
team typically must seek approval from management. 
The approval process might be fairly informal, simply involving a discussion 
with the CIO. In contrast, some organizations require a much more formal 
process for obtaining approval in which the project team submits a written 
proposal that is supplemented by presentations to management and user 
groups. After the project team’s proposal is approved, the project can move 
to the next phase of development.

implementation phase
After the plan for an information system is approved, it’s time to start build-
ing it. During the implementation phase of the SDLC, an organization puts 
together the hardware, software, and operational components for the new 
information system. 
	What happens during the implementation phase? During the 
implementation phase of the SDLC, the project team supervises the tasks 
necessary to construct the new information system. The tasks that take 
place during the implementation phase can include any of those listed in 
Figure 9-42.

ü
Purchase or contract 
for hardware/software
ü

Figure 9-42: Implementation Phase 
	How does the team acquire software and hardware? As the 
implementation phase begins, programming languages, development 
tools, and application software needed for the new information system are 
purchased, installed, and tested to ensure that they work correctly. 
Software testing can reveal problems that result from incompatibilities 
with existing hardware and software. These problems must be corrected 
before continuing with system development. Testing might also reveal bugs 
(errors) in the software, which must be corrected by the software developer. 
In addition to new software, the specifications for many information systems 
require new ­hardware, which can either replace old equipment or supple-
ment existing equipment. During the implementation phase, new hardware 
is purchased, installed, and tested to ensure that it operates ­correctly. 
When an information system will be cloud-based, there may be connectivity 
and security requirements that have to be implemented locally. In addition, 
cloud applications will have to be configured and thoroughly tested.

SECTION D, Unit 9
	What’s the next step in the implementation phase? After 
hardware and software are set up and tested, the next step in the imple-
mentation phase depends on the software tools selected for the project. 
When the software for an information system is created by using a pro-
gramming ­language or an application development tool, programmers must 
create and test all the new software modules. Unit 11 provides more infor-
mation about the programming process.
When an information system is constructed using application software, 
the software sometimes must be customized. Software customization 
is the process of modifying a commercial application to reflect an orga-
nization’s needs. Customization might include modifying the user interface, 
enabling various security settings, selecting the menus that appear on the 
screen, and designing forms or reports. 
	How can the team ensure that a new information system 
works? A rigorous testing process is the only way to make sure a new 
information system works correctly. Different types of testing during the 
implementation phase help identify and fix problems before the information 
system is incorporated into day-to-day business activities. 
Application testing is the process of trying out various sequences of input 
values and checking the results to verify that the application works as it was 
designed. Application testing is performed in three ways: unit testing, inte-
gration testing, and system testing. 
As each application module is completed, it undergoes unit testing to 
ensure that it operates reliably and correctly. When all modules have been 
completed and tested, integration testing is performed to ensure that the 
modules operate together correctly. 
After unit and integration testing are completed, system testing ensures 
that all hardware and software components work together. Figure 9-43 
summarizes the three stages of application testing.
Integration testing 
ensures that all the 
modules work together 
correctly.
System testing ensures that 
new modules work with the 
rest of the system hardware 
and software.

as unit testing?

documentation AND TRAINING
One of the most important tasks during the implementation phase is to make 
sure the information system is completely documented so that it can be 
used effectively and modified easily.
	What kinds of documentation are required? The docu-
mentation for an information system can be broadly categorized as system 
documentation or user documentation (Figure 9-44). 
System documentation describes a system’s features, hardware archi-
tecture, and programming. The target audiences for system documentation 
are programmers, designers, and analysts who might maintain the system 
on a day-to-day basis and implement modifications. 
Much of the information required for system documentation is gener-
ated in the analysis and design phases of the SDLC. At the end of the 
implementation phase, these documents should be reviewed for accuracy 
because features sometimes change as a result of problems or opportuni-
ties encountered during implementation. 
For system documentation, many project teams turn to automated applica-
tions that produce documentation from completed source code. These tools 
help the team retrofit the documentation to the actual system, which might 
differ somewhat from the original system specifications.
User documentation describes how to interact with the system to accom-
plish specific tasks. It includes a list of features and instructions for using 
them. It might also include tutorials that demonstrate how to get started and 
how to accomplish specific tasks.
	How do employees learn how to use a new information sys-
tem? In preparation for using a new information system, users generally 
need training on software use and data entry. Some users might also need 
training in hardware operation and backup procedures. 
During training sessions, users learn how to interact with the interface, use 
the new system to perform day-to-day tasks, and find additional information 
in user manuals, procedure handbooks, or video tutorials. 
A procedure handbook is a type of user ­documentation that contains step-
by-step instructions for performing specific tasks. It often takes the place of 
a lengthy user manual because in a large organization, an employee in a 
particular department usually performs specific tasks and does not need to 
know how all features of the system work.

SECTION D, Unit 9
CONVERSION AND CUTOVER
Anyone who remembers the botched debut of the HealthCare.gov Web 
site will understand the importance of a well-orchestrated system launch. 
Planning is crucial for a successful transition to a new information system. 
	What happens to data from the old system? The data for a new 
information system might exist in card files, file folders, or an old information 
system. This data must be loaded into the new system—a process called 
data conversion. A ­programmer can write conversion software to convert 
existing data into a format that is usable by the new system. Without such 
software, users would be forced to manually re-enter data from the old sys-
tem into the new system.
	What are the “go live” options? System conversion refers to the 
process of deactivating an old information system and activating a new one. 
It is also referred to as a “cutover” or “to go live.” The strategies for convert-
ing to a new system are described in Figure 9-45. 
	When is the new information system formally “live”? A new 
or upgraded ­information system undergoes a final test called acceptance 
testing. Acceptance testing is designed to verify that the new information 
system works as required. 
Procedures for acceptance testing are designed by users and systems ana-
lysts, and they often include the use of real data to demonstrate that the 
system operates correctly under normal and peak data loads. Acceptance 
testing usually marks the completion of the implementation phase.
Figure 9-45: Cutover options 
  Direct conversion is a cutover method that completely deactivates the 
old system and immediately activates the new system. Direct conversion is 
risky. If the new system does not work correctly, it might have to be deacti-
vated and undergo further development or testing. In the meantime, the old 
system is reactivated, and transactions that were entered into the new system 
must be re-entered into the old system.
  Parallel conversion avoids some of the risk of direct conversion because 
the old system remains in service while some or all of the new system is acti-
vated. Both the old and new systems operate in parallel until the project 
team can determine whether the new system is performing correctly. Parallel 
conversion often requires that all entries be made in both the new and old 
systems, which is costly in terms of time, computer resources, and personnel. 
  Phased conversion works well with large, modularized information 
systems because the new system is activated one module at a time. After 
the ­project team determines that one module is working correctly, the next 
module is activated, and so on, until the entire new system is operational. In a 
phased conversion, however, each ­module of the new system must work with 
both the old and new systems, which greatly increases the complexity and cost 
of application development.
 Pilot conversion works well in organizations with several branches 
that have ­independent information processing systems because the new 
information system is activated one branch at a time. If the new system works 
correctly at one branch, it is activated at the next branch. To prepare for a pilot 
conversion, system developers must devise methods to integrate information 
from branches using the new system with information from branches still using 
the old system. 
QuickCheck
Could a school successfully 
implement a pilot conversion for 
its library management system?
a.	 Yes, it would be simple to 
install the new system online 
as a pilot to see how it works.
b.	 Yes, but it could only be done 
if the conversion happens 
over the summer.
c.	 No, a phased conversion 
that implements a new 
patron module, then a new 
circulation module, and so on 
would work better.
d.	 No, if the new system does 
not work correctly, the 
students and instructors will 
not have access to any library 
management system.

maintenance phase
In 1962, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service launched an information system 
called Individual Master File (IMF) to store and access tax records. That 
system ran for 50 years before a failed attempt to replace it was discontin-
ued in 2009. A second attempt was ongoing when this book went to press. A 
system such as IMF that remains in service for more than 50 years is rare, 
but information systems can have unexpectedly long life spans with a main-
tenance phase that outlasts the system developers.
	What happens during the maintenance phase? The mainte-
nance phase of the SDLC involves the day-to-day operation of the system, 
making modifications to improve performance, and correcting problems. 
After an information system is imple-
mented, it remains in operation for a 
period of time. During this time, mainte-
nance activities ensure that the system 
functions as well as possible. Figure 
9-46 lists the major maintenance activi-
ties for a typical information system.
The term maintenance phase is a little 
misleading because it seems to imply 
that the ­information system is main-
tained in a static state. On the contrary, 
during the maintenance phase, an 
information system is likely to undergo 
many changes to meet an organization’s 
needs. Changes during the mainte-
nance phase can include the following:
• Updates to the operating system and 
application software
• User interface revisions to make the 
system easier to use
• Hardware replacements necessary to 
retire defective equipment or enhance 
performance 
• Security upgrades
• Quality-of-service  enhancements
	What is quality of service? The term quality of service (QoS) refers 
to the level of performance a computer system provides. When quality of 
service is good, data flows swiftly through the system, software is easy and 
intuitive to use, and work is completed quickly and without error. When qual-
ity of service is poor, users experience long waits, software is clumsy to use, 
and information is difficult to find. 
Three key concepts ensure good quality of service: reliability, availabil-
ity, and serviceability. Computer systems are reliable when they can be 
counted on to function correctly. Availability refers to the ability of the sys-
tem to be continuously accessible to all the people who use it. Systems 
exhibit serviceability when they are easily upgraded or repaired.

SECTION d, Unit 9
	What are quality-of-service metrics? A quality-of-service metric 
is a technique used for measuring a specific QoS characteristic. Data for 
these metrics can be gathered by monitoring system performance and ana-
lyzing responses to user satisfaction surveys. Businesses use several QoS 
metrics, such as those described in Figure 9-47.
QoS Metric
Description
Throughput
Amount of data processed in a particular time interval
Accuracy
Number of errors occurring in a particular time interval 
for a particular function
Downtime
Amount of time a system is not available for processing
Capacity
Available storage space, number of users, number of con-
nections, or number of packets
User levels
Number of users at peak, average, and low times
Response time
Time period between when a user initiates a request for 
information and when the request is fulfilled
Figure 9-47: Quality-of-Service Metrics 
	How important is user support? Even after in-depth training, 
employees sometimes forget procedures or have difficulty when they 
encounter a new set of circumstances. These employees turn to the IT 
department for help. 
Many organizations establish a help desk to handle end-user problems. 
The help desk is staffed by technical support specialists who are familiar 
with the information system’s software. Support specialists keep records of 
problems and solutions. 
Users with questions are usually encouraged to access online help, user 
manuals, or procedure handbooks. When those sources don’t provide 
solutions, users may be able to turn to the help desk.
Help desk personnel have little tolerance for people who ask questions that 
are clearly answered in documentation. You should not hesitate, however, 
to ask about procedures or problems that are not covered in the documen-
tation. 
Users’ questions can often promote much-needed modifications in the 
information system. For example, suppose a Zappos customer service rep-
resentative encounters a problem with an update procedure and contacts 
the help desk. The help desk technician begins to troubleshoot the problem 
and soon realizes that it was caused by a programming error not caught dur-
ing system testing. This bug is recorded in a bug report that is routed to the 
programming group, which can determine its severity and take steps to fix it.

 SECTION D
	How long does the maintenance phase last? The maintenance 
phase is the longest SDLC phase, and it lasts until the system is retired. 
Although the analysis, design, and implementation phases of the SDLC are 
costly, for many organizations, the maintenance phase is the most expen-
sive because it is the longest. 
The maintenance phase often accounts for 70% of the total cost of an 
information system. As shown in Figure 9-48, maintenance costs follow a 
U-shaped curve—an information system requires the most maintenance at 
the beginning and end of its life cycle.
	When does the maintenance phase end? The maintenance 
phase continues until an information system is no longer cost-effective or 
until changes in the organization make the information system obsolete. 
When an information system’s useful or cost-effective life nears a close, it is 
then time to begin the system development life cycle again.
1  When a new information 
system first goes live, main-
tenance costs are high while 
programmers work out bugs and 
users clamor for support. 
2  After most of the bugs are 
fixed and users become familiar 
with the information system, 
maintenance costs decrease.
3  As an information system 
nears the end of its useful life 
span, repair costs rise, and 
changing business practices 
begin to require modifications 
that are time-consuming and 
expensive to implement.

Systems at Risk
When disaster strikes your PC, it is a major inconvenience—but just for one 
person. In contrast, threats to a corporate information system can affect mil-
lions of people. They can be life threatening. They cost companies billions of 
dollars in equipment, time, and restitution. And individuals may spend count-
less hours dealing with the aftereffects.
	What kinds of disasters put information systems at risk? 
Common threats to corporate information systems include natural disasters, 
power outages, equipment failures, human errors, software failures, security 
breaches, acts of war, and vandalism. 
Natural disasters can completely shut down a computer system, cut off 
service to customers, and potentially destroy the system completely. For 
example, when Hurricane Katrina tore through Louisiana, it left a swath 
of destruction in its wake. In many businesses, computer systems were 
drenched with rain and flood waters. During the storm, power outages 
knocked down several major Internet hosting services. Power remained out 
for weeks in some places, and businesses without generators scrambled to 
continue operating. 
Power outages can be caused by natural disasters, overloaded power 
grids, planned brownouts, and rolling blackouts. When power outages shut 
down information systems, the data is not accessible to carry out business 
operations nor is it available to clients and consumers. 
Equipment failures can occur in any hardware component of an informa-
tion system. The risk of failures increases as a hardware component ages, 
but they can also occur in new hardware. Many device specifications include 
an MTBF (mean time between ­failures) rating. For example, an MTBF rat-
ing of 125,000 hours means that, on average, a device could function for 
125,000 hours before failing. MTBF ratings are averages, however, so a 
server with a 125,000 MTBF rating might operate for only 10 hours before it 
fails, for example.
Human errors are mistakes made by computer operators. Common 
errors within an information system include entering inaccurate data and 
failing to ­follow required procedures. Poorly trained computer operators 
were blamed for the biggest North American blackout in history, which 
left more than 50 million people without power in the summer of 2003. 
Software failures can be caused by bugs or flawed software design. 
Flaws in critical software that controls air traffic or nuclear power plants can 
be deadly. Other bugs may cause security leaks that allow unauthorized 
access to corporate servers. 
Acts of war once affected only computer systems located on battlefronts. 
With a recent increase in terrorist incidents, however, ­civilian areas have 
become targets. Acts of war can cause physical damage to computer sys-
tems. Cyberterrorism can also cause damage, using viruses and worms to 
destroy data and otherwise disrupt computer-based operations, which now 
include critical national infrastructures such as power grids and telecommu-
nications systems. 
Sabotage and vandalism may be caused by disgruntled employees, 
protesters, activists, or enemy combatants. Not limited to physical damage, 
sabotage and vandalism also include defacing Web sites, denial-of-service  
attacks, and holding information systems for ransom.

SECTION e, Unit 9
Data CEnters
When you are using your iPhone or iPad, have you ever wondered about 
the source of all those iTunes tracks and Apple Store apps? Where are the 
information systems that run Siri and help you find your iPhone? Where is 
the storage facility that holds your iCloud data? You might envision all these 
activities taking place on computers in the basement of Apple’s Cupertino  
headquarters, but most iTunes downloads and iCloud services are housed 
in massive data centers in California, Oregon, and North Carolina. 
	What does a data center contain? A data center is a specialized 
facility designed to hold and protect computer systems and data. These 
centers may be dedicated to information systems for a single company, 
or they may be a colocation center in which several corporations lease 
space and equipment. The contents of a data center include computers, 
storage devices, telecommunications devices, and backup power supplies. 
In addition, data centers typically contain security equipment to restrict 
unauthorized access and environmental controls that protect all the equip-
ment (Figure 9-49).
	How does a data center help minimize risks? Data centers are 
designed to proactively reduce the risk of data loss that might occur as a 
result of a disaster. The best way to protect against risk is to avoid it alto-
gether, and data centers can reduce or negate the effects of some types of 
disasters. 
Most areas experience occasional power failures or blackouts, which can 
be costly to organizations whose goal is to offer 24/7 coverage. To avoid 
downtime, one of the most basic requirements for a data center is a sup-
ply of uninterrupted power from high-capacity, backup batteries and power 
generators. 
Physical security is critical to data centers. Most data centers limit physical 
access using fingerprint identification systems, badges, or security guards. 
Steel doors divide the centers into secure areas. Motion detectors and auto-
mated alarm systems prevent unauthorized movement through the building. 
Environmental conditions in a data center must be monitored at all times. 
Computerized sensing devices track temperature, humidity, water, smoke, 
fire, air flow, power levels, security systems, and many other metrics. 
Cameras can be placed in air ducts, under raised floors, and in computer 
system units to detect intruders, pests, or chemical leaks.

Below sea level or in a floodplain

munications infrastructure

accidents and violence put people and 
equipment at risk

unreliable
	What is the most secure location for a data center? Data cen-
ters can be located on site or in specially selected off-site locations. In-house 
data centers are often located in basements where equipment and wires 
are out of sight and where server racks and battery backups are not adding 
excessive weight loads to above-ground floors. Basements are not an ideal 
location, however. They are susceptible to floods and plumbing leaks from 
floors above. Other locations that are not suitable for data centers include 
those listed in Figure 9-50.
Bahnhof Pionen is located 100 feet 
beneath Stockholm, Sweden, and 
sometimes called the “James Bond” 
data center.
Iron Mountain is located 220 feet 
underground in a limestone cave near 
Pittsburgh.
Smartbunker runs on wind power and 
is housed in a former NATO command 
bunker in the Lincolnshire Wolds, U.K.
InfoBunker is a 65,000-square-foot 
data center built in a decommissioned 
Air Force bunker designed to survive a 
20-megaton nuclear blast.
A data center might be a small room containing a single server with battery 
backup, or it can be an elaborate facility that stretches over many acres of 
land and requires a dedicated power-generating system. Apple built one of 
the world’s largest data centers in Maiden, NC. The main building contains 
505,000 square feet and is powered by a 55,000-panel solar array that gen-
erates enough electricity to supply more than 13,500 homes. 
Data centers may be staffed, or they may be controlled and monitored 
remotely. A so-called dark data center requires no permanent staff. 
Technicians enter the facility only when equipment needs to be repaired 
or replaced. These dark data centers are an extension of lights-out 
management (LOM), which allows system administrators to monitor and 
manage servers using remote control software.
Off-site data centers are housed in specially constructed buildings or in 
refurbished facilities, such as former military bunkers, abandoned mines, 
or limestone caves. Some of the world’s most secure data centers are 
listed in Figure 9-51.

SECTION e, Unit 9
Disaster recovery planning
It seemed like an ordinary Friday when a contract employee walked into 
a Chicago-area Federal Aviation Administration facility carrying a suitcase. 
But the suitcase contained gasoline, and minutes later, the facility’s comput-
ers were in flames. Pilots lost radio links to the control tower, and air-traffic 
controllers’ screens went black. Planes that were in the air managed to land 
without incident, but in the days and weeks that followed, thousands of flights 
were canceled and many more delayed at Chicago O’Hare International and 
Chicago Midway International airports. Data centers can’t offer 100% pro-
tection, so savvy system administrators have disaster recovery plans.
	What’s included in a disaster recovery plan? A disaster recov-
ery plan is a step-by-step description of the methods used to secure data 
against disaster and a set of guidelines for how an organization will recover 
lost data and resume operations if and when a disaster occurs.
Disaster recovery plans not only must deal with calamities such as the FAA 
air traffic control fire or the Tsunami that hit Japan in 2011; they also must 
take into account day-to-day events that could potentially disrupt operations. 
Backup tapes can become corrupted, an employee might spill coffee onto 
the most critical storage device in the building, or a virus can slow down the 
network to the point that it’s unusable. 
A well-formulated disaster recovery plan should account for all kinds of trou-
ble, from the most minor glitch to the most destructive disaster. Specifically, 
an enterprise-wide disaster recovery plan should:
• Ensure the safety of people on the premises at the time of a disaster.
• Continue critical business operations.
• Minimize the duration of a serious disruption to operations. 
• Minimize immediate damage and prevent additional losses.
• Establish management succession and emergency powers.
• Facilitate effective coordination of recovery tasks.
A disaster recovery plan can mean the difference between an organization 
rebounding after a disaster or simply ceasing to exist. Disaster recovery 
plans are as critical to data security as data backups, ­firewalls, and pass-
word protection. 
	Is a cloud-based information system more secure than a local 
one? Today, many disaster recovery plans incorporate cloud facilities as 
off-site backup that will be available in case of a major incident at an in-
house data center. Some companies operate mirror systems at cloud sites 
or depend on multiple colocation centers for processing data as well as stor-
ing it. Figure 9-52 lists the advantages of cloud facilities.
Copies of data are stored in a separate 
location outside the disaster zone.
Secure and remote access to critical 
data is available even from temporary 
offices.
Cloud-based systems can be scaled up 
to handle workloads transferred from 
damaged systems.
Experienced teams at the cloud hosting 
service can help restore critical systems, 
while in-house teams focus on restoring 
damaged systems.

Data Breaches
Zappos: 24 million. LivingSocial: 50,000. Target: 70 million. Home Depot: 
56 million. J.P. Morgan: 76,000. Anthem: 80 million. Those figures are not 
corporate profits, but the number of customer records that were subject to 
unauthorized access in the course of massive data breaches. In the U.S., 
data breaches are on a steady upward swing, with close to 1,000 companies 
per year discovering that their information systems have been attacked. 
	What triggers a data breach? A data breach is an incident in which 
personal data is viewed, accessed, or retrieved without authorization. 
Massive data breaches that expose personal data stored in an information 
system can be triggered by malware, human factors, and system glitches.
Malware attacks. Hacking accounts for about 30% of data breaches. In 
2015, the hacker’s tool of choice was malware called Backoff that sneaks 
into a computer through an open port used by the Windows Remote Desktop 
application. Once the malware has compromised a computer on the net-
work, it attempts to access point-of-sale cash registers and card readers, 
where it gathers data and forwards it to hackers. Backoff was responsible for 
massive data breaches at Target, Home Depot, Neiman Marcus, and Dairy 
Queen. Data breaches usually occur over an extended period of weeks or 
months, while hackers plant malware, open backdoors, and try to crack 
administrator-level passwords. 
Employee negligence. Access to data in information systems is con-
trolled by login credentials, such as passwords. If these credentials fall into 
the wrong hands, data is vulnerable to access by unauthorized persons. 
Identity thieves acquire login credentials by scooping up passwords written 
on Post-it Notes, and using social engineering attacks to extract passwords 
from careless employees. In the Target breach, a third-party contractor inad-
vertently supplied the password used to gain access to Target’s network.
Insider theft. Some employees are dishonest and use their legitimate 
access to information systems as a chance to skim data for illegal pur-
poses. In 2015, financial services giant Morgan Stanley announced that an 
employee had stolen personal data for more than 900 wealthy clients. The 
employee allegedly posted the data on the Pastebin Web site and was trying 
to sell it to criminals who peddle in identity theft. 
Device theft. Employees sometimes have legitimate reasons to carry 
devices loaded with consumer data or applications that provide remote 
access to corporate information systems. When these devices are stolen, 
the data they contain may fall into unauthorized hands. For example, in 
2014, a home health care nurse’s laptop bag was stolen. According to com-
pany policy, the laptop was password protected and its data was encrypted. 
However, the encryption key was on a slip of paper in the bag, giving the 
thief unencrypted access to all the patient data stored on the device. 
System glitches. Poorly configured servers, networks that lack adequate 
security, and databases without proper access controls are the cause of 
many data breaches. In 2014, a misconfigured server at a U.S. financial insti-
tution allowed Google search crawlers to access and index information from 
the company’s client databases. The exposed information, which appeared 
in Google searches, included client account statements with account holder 
names, routing numbers, and balances. Additional documents exposed by 
the data breach contained instructions on how to authorize new accounts 
and the passwords necessary to gain access to corporate servers.

SECTION E, Unit 9
	How do security breaches affect individuals? Just about every 
person in America has personal information stored in at least one digital 
information system. Every time you fill out a survey, register to use a Web 
site, visit your doctor, use your credit card, or make a phone call, personal 
information is stored in an information system. When that personal informa-
tion falls into the wrong hands, the risk of identity theft increases.
Identity theft is the fraudulent use of someone’s personal information to 
carry out transactions, such as applying for loans, making purchases, col-
lecting tax refunds, or obtaining false identity documents. Identity thieves 
especially covet Social Security numbers, passwords and PINs for access-
ing financial accounts, and bank card numbers. Other personally identifiable 
information (PII), such as mother’s maiden name, place of birth, driver’s 
license number, and passport number, also opens doors for identity thieves.
	How do identity thieves use the data they steal? There are 
countless ways in which stolen personal information is fraudulently used. 
Figure 9-53 lists some of the most prevalent scams.
Take out a loan in the victim’s name and not pay off the 
debt. The bad debt becomes part of the victim’s credit 
report and lowers the credit score. Identity thieves may 
even file for bankruptcy to cover the debts, further ruining 
the victim’s credit score.
Open a bank account using the victim’s name, and then 
write bad checks.
Cash forged checks to empty a victim’s bank account.
Subscribe to cellular phone service, cable Internet service, 
or utilities using the victim’s name, but never pay the bills. 
Change the billing address for a victim’s credit card, 
and then make purchases.
Produce fake credit or debit cards using the victim’s 
card numbers, and then make electronic withdrawals.
Apply for a tax refund in the victim’s name. The victim’s 
legitimate return might be flagged as fraudulent or inaccu-
rate and lead to an audit or tax fraud charges.
Use a stolen Social Security number to apply for retire-
ment benefits, which will be sent to the identity thief. 
When the victim later applies for benefits, they will already 
have been distributed.
Figure 9-53: HOW IDENTITY THIEVES USE STOLEN IDENTITIES
Sell the victim’s data to other criminals who consoli-
date it with data gathered from different sources. 
Profiles that are detailed enough can supply an 
entire identity that criminals use when trying to 
evade police, work illegally, board planes, or carry out 
other illicit activities.

Security Measures
No computer system can be completely risk-free, but several proactive 
measures can protect information systems from threats. 
	How? Measures that protect information systems can be grouped 
into four categories: deterrents, ­preventive countermeasures, corrective 
procedures, and detection activities.
• Deterrents reduce the likelihood of a deliberate attack. Physical deterrents, 
such as limiting access to critical servers, fall under this category. Common 
deterrents also include security features such as multi-level authentication, 
password protection, and biometric identification. 
• Preventive countermeasures shield vulnerabilities to render an attack 
unsuccessful or reduce its impact. Firewalls that prevent unauthorized 
access to a system and encryption that makes stolen data indecipherable 
are examples of preventive countermeasures. 
• Corrective procedures reduce the effect of an attack. Data backups, 
disaster recovery plans, and the availability of redundant hardware devices 
all are examples of corrective procedures.
• Detection activities recognize attacks and trigger preventive countermea-
sures or corrective procedures. For example, antivirus software detects 
viruses entering a system and can be ­configured to perform corrective pro-
cedures such as removing the virus and quarantining infected files. Theft 
or ­vandalism can be detected by periodic hardware inventories. The use of 
monitoring software to track users, file updates, and changes to critical sys-
tems can also help detect anomalies that indicate an intrusion or a threat.
	How quickly are data breaches discovered? Although most 
enterprises monitor their information systems, most data breaches are 
discovered by third parties, such as law enforcement agencies, ISPs, 
and security firms, which report suspicious activity to system adminis-
trators. Fraud detection systems designed to catch unauthorized credit 
card use account for about 24% of the discoveries. Surprisingly, cus-
tomer complaints lead to about 10% of data breach discoveries. What 
is somewhat disheartening is the length of time data breaches remain 
undiscovered (Figure 9-54).

SECTION E, Unit 9
	Are there laws that protect personal data? At least 47 states 
have data breach notification statutes that require corporations to take spe-
cific steps if a data breach exposes personally identifiable information. There 
are also several federal data breach laws that apply to certain business sec-
tors, such as education, health care, and banking (Figure 9-55).
EDUCATION The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is 
designed to protect student records by allowing them to be distributed only to 
students, their parents, school officials, financial aid institutions, and accredit-
ing agencies.
HEALTH CARE The Health Information Technology for Economic and 
Clinical Health (HITECH) Act requires any institution that handles personally iden-
tifiable health information to notify individuals of data breaches within 60 days. 
BANKING The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act provides guidelines to financial 
institutions for notifying consumers of a data breach. The Red Flags Rule issued 
in 2007 requires financial institutions to implement identity theft programs. 
	What can consumers do to minimize their vulnerability to 
security breaches? Even if businesses adhere to applicable disclosure 
laws, those laws apply to data that has already been breached. Although 
the laws also contain guidelines for securing data, it’s clear from the con-
tinuing succession of data breaches that laws are not sufficient protection 
for personal data.
Consumers are dependent on corporate policies and security procedures 
to safeguard personal data stored on information systems. Once you’ve 
released data to an information system, you no longer have control of its 
distribution or its security. To minimize the risk of identity theft and other 
mishaps that arise from data breaches, consumers should be vigilant about 
the information they divulge.
• Know when data is being collected. Be aware of activities—both 
online and offline—that can possibly collect personal information, such 
as registering to use a Web site, participating in a survey, submitting your 
resume to an online employment service, requesting a product rebate, 
participating in online discussion groups, clicking pop-up ads, and so on. 
When asked for information, supply only what’s required. Never divulge 
your Social Security number, and be cautious about sharing other personal 
information, such as your telephone number or address. When in doubt, 
you might consider using phony data.
• Find out how data is being used. Look at the organization’s privacy 
policy. Is the data being used internally? Is it being shared with other orga-
nizations and aggregated with other data? If so, will that third party protect 
your data with an adequate level of security?
• Find out what data is retained. Some organizations de-identify data 
by removing names, Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, and 
other data that identifies a specific person. Consumers should realize that 
in an age of big data, even de-identified data can be relinked to your per-
sonal data through data mining techniques discussed in Unit 10.
• Don’t trade your privacy. Be wary of offers for free services in 
exchange for personal information or permission to track your online foot-
prints. Such data can be especially useful for identity thieves assembling a 
profile to substantiate their use of your Social Security number and other 
personal data.

What is the significance of 
de-identified data in the context 
of identity theft?
a.	 It is useless to identity 
thieves.
b.	 It is collected secretly.

data, it can be relinked to a 
person’s PII.
d.	 It is a result of trading private 
information for free access to

offers to shield data or provide credit reports. 
Do not click on links in email, text messages, 
or social media sites about any data breaches. 
For information about a data breach, connect 
only to the company’s legitimate Web site 
directly from your browser.
 Remain vigilant. Regularly check your credit reports to 
make sure there are no unauthorized charges or other signs 
of fraud.
 Activate a fraud alert. If you 
suspect that your Social Security 
number has been compromised, 
place a fraud alert on your credit 
reports. A fraud alert informs poten-
tial lenders that they must verify the 
identity of anyone attempting to open 
an account in your name. Fraud 
alerts are free and don’t interfere 
with your ability to receive instant 
credit. Fraud alerts are temporary, 
however, so they must be renewed 
every 90 days in most cases.
 Get informed. Do not take a “wait-and-see” approach 
to any data breach that involves Social Security numbers. 
Go to the company’s Web site and carefully read informa-
tion about the breach. Pay close attention to the scope 
of data that is exposed. Does it include Social Security 
numbers and other authentication data such as mother’s 
maiden name and bank card security numbers?

Issue: What Can go Wrong?
On a crisp autumn day in 2013, 
Americans eagerly began to access the federal 
government’s new health insurance Web site, 
HealthCare.gov. Within minutes, response time 
slowed to a crawl, screens froze, and the site went 
offline, leaving consumers frustrated and confused.
HealthCare.gov is a product of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act or PPACA, 
which was enacted to lower the cost of health 
insurance and decrease the number of uninsured 
Americans. The PPACA estab-
lished insurance exchanges where 
consumers can purchase health 
insurance. Exchanges are run by 
state governments and by the fed-
eral government. HealthCare.gov is a 
Web site that offers health insurance 
through the federal exchange. 
Developing HealthCare.gov was 
an ambitious project. Its scope and 
complexity required top-notch commu-
nication, transparency, accountability, 
collaboration, design, and testing. 
What went wrong? Who was at fault? 
The blame might be placed on the 
developers, the White House, or the 
oversight agency.
The developers. Fifty-five companies were con-
tracted to participate in the development effort. 
Canadian firm CGI Federal was the primary contrac-
tor, and it was responsible for integrating the Web 
site with health insurer databases and Oracle iden-
tity management modules. Although in charge of 
integration, CGI was not responsible for oversight of 
the project. Within its designated scope of system 
requirements, CGI programmers may have produced 
sloppy code in order to meet unrealistic deadlines.
The White House. System requirements for 
HealthCare.gov depended on a set of regulations 
that outlined how the federal exchange would work, 
such as the list of services that were required for 
qualified health plans. The administration may have 
deliberately held up controversial rules to limit bad 
press until after the 2012 elections. Final rules were 
not issued until February 2013. Developers then had 
fewer than eight months to develop and test the sys-
tem before the October 2013 go-live date. The project 
was further politicized by the administration’s desire 
to see its signature piece of legislation come to frui-
tion before critics were able to block it.
The oversight agency. Healthcare.gov develop-
ment was assigned to the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) and under the oversight 
of the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS). These agen-
cies clearly lacked expertise in IT 
system development and were unable 
to manage the project’s schedule. By 
June 2013, it was clear that the project 
was headed for failure. A CMS email 
showed growing concern: “The build 
appears to be way off track and getting 
worse.…We are one week out from 
production deployment, and we are 
being told already that it doesn’t work.”
Then in July, the U.S. Government 
Accountability Office voiced concern 
that final integration testing for all the 
agency systems would not be com-
pleted before the start of the enrollment 
period in October. And just a few days 
before the go-live date, a top official at CMS stated, 
“The facts are that we have not successfully handled 
more than 500 concurrent users.”
Insiders at CMS had reasons to delay the launch 
date. In addition to lack of testing and inability to han-
dle the anticipated load of users, the top CMS security 
officer recommended against signing the Authority to 
Operate needed to go live, noting that 40% of secu-
rity controls were not tested, so it was unknown if the 
Web site would protect personally identifiable infor-
mation. 
Despite all the warning signs, CMS and HHS offi-
cials stated repeatedly that HealthCare.gov would be 
ready for launch in October. The system launched on 
the target date. It was not ready.
“The real problems 
with HealthCare.gov 
are related to the ‘worst 
practices’ that went into 
the project nearly from 
the beginning. Each 
of these missteps, com-
bined with the generally 
hostile atmosphere in 
Washington surround-
ing the Affordable Care 
Act, nearly guaranteed 
HealthCare.gov would be 
late, broken, or both.”

1. Would you enroll in a health insurance plan from HealthCare.gov?
2. Do you think that HealthCare.gov is a good use of tax dollars?
3. Do you think that the problems that were experienced during 
HealthCare.gov 1.0 will lead to better development methodology prac-

What Do You Think?
 ISSUE
TRY IT! The botched HealthCare.gov rollout is a classic “what can 
go wrong” case study in systems analysis and design. It was a high-stakes 
development effort that is not yet complete. You can get a handle on the 
story now so you’ll be up to speed as events continue to unfold.
	 Technology does not exist in a world of its own. It is designed and 
deployed within the context of societies and economies. HealthCare.
gov was affected by political divisions over the Affordable Care Act. 
What was the stated purpose of the PPACA? How many people was 
it expected to serve? Which political party supported the bill? Why? 
Which political party opposed the bill? Why? 
	 After the failure of the original HealthCare.gov Web site, a team of pri-
vate sector IT professionals was hired to create HealthCare.gov 2.0. 
What can you learn about this development project? Can you identify 
various stages of the SDLC that they followed? Take a look at the cur-
rent HealthCare.gov Web site. Can you identity five ways in which it 
resembles other popular ecommerce sites? 
	 Open your browser and go to 
YouTube to view the videos 
7Vc8sxhy2I4 and GLQyj-kBRdo 
featuring speakers from IT firms 
that were called in to help iden-

that HealthCare.gov version 1.0 
experienced. Briefly outline the 
similarities between the two pre-
sentations. List the three top 
problems these developers iden-
tified in the first development 
attempt.
	 Looking back at the development effort for HealthCare.gov 1.0, some 
analysts have suggested that agile development methodology would 
have led to a more successful outcome. Although this would seem like 
a technical discussion, in today’s Information Age, understanding the 
difference between agile methodology and the waterfall methodology 
becomes a key part of making an informed decision on how the gov-
ernment spent more than $1 billion of taxpayer money. Write at least 
two paragraphs comparing agile methodology with waterfall method-
ology, and then explain which one you think would have been most 
successful for a system development project such as HealthCare.gov.

Information in newspapers, Web sites, blogs, and other sources is rarely 
100% objective. No matter what the source, information is rarely presented 
in a way that is fair and balanced.
Rather than searching fruitlessly for unbiased information, it can be more 
practical to recognize the viewpoints of information at hand and sift through 
it for ideas and facts that can be corroborated as correct from other sources.
Biased material is not necessarily useless. For some projects, you might 
actively seek material that presents strong viewpoints. For example, when 
you want to compare and contrast divergent political viewpoints, you might 
actively look for biased material.
Information that is skewed toward a particular viewpoint can be classified 
as propaganda, misinformation, disinformation, or parody. 
• Look for loaded words that evoke strong emotions, 
exaggerate, sensationalize, or vilify. Loaded words 
can help you uncover subtle viewpoints; positive 
words point to viewpoints that are supported.
• Look for evidence that the author is affiliated with a 
business or an organization that might affect his or 
her viewpoint. Skim the author’s other publications 
(articles, blogs, Web site) and biographical infor-
mation (Facebook, Wikipedia) for clues about his 
or her views.
• Consider if only one side of an issue is presented.
• Consider if the site’s sponsor has a commercial, 
social, political, or other agenda that would affect 
the viewpoint of information presented at the site.
• Look at other articles on the site. Sites tend to 
carry articles of similar viewpoints, and some might 
more blatantly show their bias.
Propaganda
Information that is true but 
selectively represented in a way that 
encourages recipients to form certain opin-
ions. In the old days, it was called “flim 
flam.” Today, it is called “spin.”
Misinformation 
Information that is unintentionally not 
true, such as a misstatement, gaffe, or error 
that isn’t deliberate. Many urban legends 
fall into this category.
Disinformation 
False information that is dissemi-
nated with the deliberate intention of 
influencing policies or opinions. Examples 
include spam, fake viruses, and hoaxes.
Parody
Humorous or satirical information that 
imitates or mimics a real event or an original 
work and is often disseminated to make 
fun of the subject.
Identifying biased information is not always easy. Viewpoints are some-
times subtle; and if they match your own views, you might not recognize 
them as biased. Here are some tips to help you detect viewpoint:

TRY IT! How is your “spin” radar? Can you spot viewpoints? Can 
you identify misinformation and distinguish it from propaganda and disinfor-
mation? Let’s see if you can.
	Watch each of the following YouTube videos and indicate whether it is 
propaganda, disinformation, misinformation, or parody.
	
	 a. Medieval helpdesk with English subtitles
	
	 b. Apple - Introducing iPhone 5c - For the colorful
	
	 c. Mac vs PC (Viruses)
	
	 d. iPhone App makes popcorn!
	Richard Stallman and the Software & Information Industry Association 
(SIIA) are at odds about an important digital issue. What is the issue, 
and what are the two divergent viewpoints?
	The Huffington Post has been labeled as a liberal-leaning news out-
let. Many technology enthusiasts read its technology section, however, 
for information about the latest products and gadgets. Connect to the 
Huffington Post and read a technology article. Can you detect any evi-
dence of bias in the article, and do any other elements on the page, 
such as advertising or links to other articles, reveal the site’s bias?
	How does Google’s ranking system work? Use any search engine to 
look up PigeonRank. How would you classify the information at this 
site?
	Many people are not aware of their own bias; and when gathering 
facts, they tend to accept information that supports their biases and 
look for ways to refute data that doesn’t. To find out if you have a bias 
that you’re not aware of, go to the Project Implicit site and take a Demo 
Test. Which test did you take, and were the results what you expected?
	In this world, there are enthusiastic Microsoft supporters and there are 
die-hard Apple fans. Even tech journalists have a hard time remain-
ing unbiased or keeping their bias under wraps. Check out the online 
Bloomberg Businessweek article, “With Creativity, the Computing 
Industry Can Survive Windows 8,” by Ashlee Vance. (If this article isn’t 
available, look for similar articles on Vance’s Web site.) What do you 
detect as his bias, and why?
	Technology columnists, innovators, and entrepreneurs influence not 
only consumers, but the entire direction of society. They have unique 
viewpoints that shape their work. They may even have a social, politi-
cal, or economic agenda to promote. Look up biographies for the 
following computer-industry VIPs so that you can fill in the table below.

Technology in Context: Medicine
The health care industry was 
an early adopter of computer technology for tradi-
tional data processing applications, such as client 
billing and employee payroll. A computer’s ability to 
process and store thousands of records helps reduce 
hospital administrative costs. Linking hospital billing 
to health insurance companies streamlines cumber-
some manual procedures for submitting insurance 
claims. These behind-the-scenes applications do 
not, however, directly affect the quality of health care, 
where computer technology has now made a signifi-
cant contribution. 
Until recent years, paper charts dangled from the 
foot of every hospital bed and additional information 
was stored in thick file folders in nursing stations or 
the hospital’s medical records department. Patient 
records include doctors’ diagnoses, laboratory test 
results, medication schedules, and charts depicting a 
patient’s vital signs. 
The process of maintaining these paper-based 
records is time-consuming and prone to errors. 
Effective treatments might be dangerously delayed 
while a slip of paper that holds laboratory results 
wends its way through the hospital corridors. In a hos-
pital where a patient’s condition can change suddenly 
and unexpectedly, health care providers need instant 
and ubiquitous access to the information contained in 
the patient’s record. 
Today, technology allows hospitals to store patient 
records in computer databases that are instantly 
accessible to doctors, nurses, and other health care 
workers. A nurse can access a patient’s record from a 
computer in the nursing station to check care instruc-
tions and enter vital statistics. Doctors can access 
a patient’s record from an office or home computer 
to check progress, order tests, and make decisions 
when minutes count. Lab technicians can enter test 
results immediately into a patient’s record. 
Patient records tie into a comprehensive hospital 
information system (HIS) that integrates just about 
every aspect of hospital management. Even the hos-
pital dietitian can access relevant parts of a patient’s 
record to work out menus that fit a patient’s dietary 
needs, while avoiding allergies. 
According to technology pioneer Ray Kurzweil, 
“medicine is among the most knowledge-intensive 
professions.” Most doctors agree that medicine has 
grown too complex to have all the answers “in their 
heads.” Today, in just about every aspect of their 
practices, doctors use computer applications and 
Internet technologies. 
At one time, doctors dictated the results of an exami-
nation or a surgical procedure. The dictated notes 
were later transcribed into computer records by staff 
members. Today’s technology allows doctors to enter 
this information directly into computerized patient 
records by typing or by dictating into a speech rec-
ognition system that digitally converts their comments 
into computer text. 
The Internet supplies physicians with many infor-
mational and diagnostic resources. Health libraries 
provide online access to reference databases, such 
as MEDLINE and STAT!Ref. Doctors use drug data-
bases to choose appropriate medications, avoid 
dangerous drug interactions, determine correct dos-
ages, and print out prescriptions. One physician 
says, “I use the computer to make sure the medicine 
will work with any other medicines the patient takes, 
the patient won’t be allergic, and to check for warn-
ings about certain foods or alcohol.” 
Hospitals are ideal candidates for wireless technolo-
gies because just about everything and everyone 
is on the move, including doctors, nurses, patients, 
and equipment. Overlake Hospital Medical Center 
in Bellevue, Washington, is a model of future wired, 
paperless hospitals. Nurses tote portable computer 
stations, physicians use voice recognition software to 
enter prescriptions, and bar-coded patient wristbands 
help caregivers administer and track medications.

The Internet’s ability to rapidly disseminate informa-
tion worldwide makes it a crucial tool for tracking 
global health threats. During the H1N1 outbreak in 
2009, Web sites maintained by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease 
Control (CDC) provided statistics on the spread of 
infection. They also kept doctors, researchers, and 
reporters up to date on efforts to identify the virus, 
develop a vaccine, and devise treatment options. 
Many doctors use Internet technology to communi-
cate with their colleagues by email and send imaging 
data, such as X-rays, to specialists. Telemedicine 
uses communications links to supply medical 
services at a distance. It can be used to provide spe-
cialty medical services to rural patients and allow 
medical personnel from several locations to collabo-
rate on patient diagnosis and treatment. 
Once limited to telephone consultations and fax 
transmission of paper-based patient records, tele-
medicine now takes full advantage of the Internet 
to transfer electronic patient records, still images, 
and even full-motion video sequences. Images 
from diverse sources, such as X-rays, MRIs, and 
CT scans, stored in the standard DICOM (Digital 
Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format, 
can be easily transferred over the Internet and dis-
played using a single software package. 
Computers have become an integral part of modern 
medical equipment. The use of X-rays was a huge 
medical breakthrough in the early 1900s, but X-rays 
capture only a two-dimensional image. A technol-
ogy called CT (computed tomography) essentially 
assembles a series of X-ray images taken from 
slightly different angles. A computer works with the 
data to generate a three-dimensional image that can 
be rotated and viewed from any angle. 
Computers, data, and telecommunications technol-
ogy team up in a number of mobile medical devices 
that have revolutionized emergency medical ser-
vices. An EMS worker describes a device used to 
monitor cardiac patients: “We can do a comprehen-
sive 12-lead EKG at the scene, and the computer 
inside the LIFEPAK 12 tells us what kind of arrhyth-
mia we may be dealing with and even gives us 
suggestions for treatments.” 
Today, most patients want to be informed partici-
pants in their health care. Patients use Web sites 
such as WebMD to find information on diseases, 
drugs, and treatment options. Doctors frequently 
recommend health-related Web sites and support 
groups to patients. Patients can gather information 
from these sites at their own pace and refer back to 
it as necessary. The availability of information on the 
Web reduces the need for doctors to make lengthy 
explanations that patients often cannot absorb or 
remember during an office visit. 
The computer’s use in medicine is not without poten-
tial pitfalls. Online patient records raise issues of 
confidentiality. Many patients are concerned about 
unauthorized access to their records by employers, 
human resources staff, and hackers. 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA) requires insurance companies to protect 
the privacy of their policy holders from inappropriate 
use or disclosure. Insurance company employees 
are allowed to look at clients’ personal health infor-
mation only in the course of administering claims. 
Insurance companies are not allowed to disclose 
personal health information to any other company or 
to a client’s employer without permission. Insurance 
companies are, however, allowed to divulge infor-
mation to government agencies if a serious threat 
to public health and safety exists. HIPAA also gives 
patients the right to amend incorrect or missing 
information in their records, and it allows clients to 
request a list of the disclosures. 
The next time you’re in a hospital or doctor’s office, 
look around for computers. You’re sure to find these 
essential tools used to improve the effectiveness of 
your health care.

The risk of identity theft continues to increase each 
year as it affects more and more consumers. Collect 
recent statistics for the number of people who are 
identity theft victims and the estimated annual finan-
cial losses it causes. In addition to the risk of identity 
theft, anyone who connects to the Internet is endan-
gered by malware, unauthorized intrusions, and other 
exploits. How do you see these dangers affecting 
people’s willingness to use online platforms for shop-
ping, banking, and social interactions? Will these 
dangers eventually have a chilling effect on Internet 
use? Will people simply ignore the risk? Or will new 
technologies emerge that can dependably protect 
consumers? Explain your predictions.
Group Project
Form a group of two to five students to act as the 
project team for a system development project. 
Elect one person as the team leader, who will assign 
tasks to each group member. Your team’s mission is 
to complete the planning phase for a system devel-
opment project and produce a project development 
plan. The first task is to identify and briefly describe 
an information system at school, work, or a local busi-
ness that needs improvement. The second task is to 
make a list of problems and opportunities that exist in 
that system by applying Porter’s Five Forces Model 
and Wetherbe’s PIECES framework. The third task 
is to make a list of actions your team would perform 
to design, construct, and implement a new informa-
tion system. Finally, your team should incorporate all 
its findings into a document that would serve as the 
project development plan. Submit this plan to your 
instructor, who might provide additional directions for 
your group work and report format. 
Cyberclassroom
The taxpayer-supported U.S. Office of Justice 
Programs maintains a Web site called 
OnGuardOnline.gov that offers a variety of educa-
tional material to help consumers stay safe online. 
Connect to the site and choose the Video and Media 
link. Evaluate one of the games, such as the ID Theft 
FaceOff. Is the material accurate and useful? Who 
is the target audience? What is your overall impres-
sion? 
Multimedia Project
One of the most fascinating aspects of Michael 
Porter’s Five Forces model is the concept of substi-
tute products and services. The classic case is the 
automobile industry replacing horse-drawn carriages 
and the widespread effects on associated industries. 
Find a unique example of a substitute product or ser-
vice that changed an industry. Try to track its effects 
on at least ten suppliers or distributors. Locate photos 
to illustrate your examples.
Resume Builder
Create ten rules for an expert system that pertains to 
your career field. To complete the assignment, think 
of a set of simple decisions that someone on the job 
might be required to perform. For example, a loan 
officer might be required to make a quick evaluation 
of a borrower, an auto mechanic might be required 
to figure out what various tapping noises mean, or 
a fitness instructor might be required to recommend 
the best type of fitness class for clients. Make a list 
of ten rules that would help make the decision. The 
rules should be in the “If..., Then...” format. Submit 
your rules to your instructor.
Globalization
Many of the products we use every day have a sur-
prisingly global supply chain. Connect to http:// free.
sourcemap.com, where you can view supply chain 
maps. Choose one of the maps and track the chain 
from suppliers to consumers. Notice the significance 
of the color key that ranges from upstream (suppli-
ers) to downstream (consumer markets). Now, draw 
your own source map for a product of your choice. 
Try something simple, such as lemonade or a pair 
of socks. To draw your map, you can register at the 
Sourcemap site, draw a map by hand, use graphics 
software, or superimpose your supply chain onto a 
Google map.

Unit 9
SECTION B: Enterprises use various kinds of software 
for core business operations. Ecommerce refers to business 
transactions that are conducted electronically over a com-
puter network. Ecommerce activities are classified as B2C, 
C2C, B2G, and 
 . When custom-
ers put items in their online shopping carts, the ecommerce 
site’s server sends a(n) 
 to the cus-
tomer’s computers containing the ID number of a shopping 
cart. The server also stores the ID number, along with a list of 
items purchased. Payment authorization is facilitated through 
a payment 
 . Information systems 
are used to track and control the 
 
chain, which begins with raw materials shipped to a manu-
facturer, monitors finished goods shipped to distributors, and 
ends with merchandise delivered to customers. Enterprises 
also use 
 applications to coordinate 
sales, marketing, and customer support. Data for these sys-
tems may originate from 
 
programs or from customer information collected during 
the sales cycle. 
 is a suite of software 
modules that use a common database and a common user 
interface. These modules typically include applications for 
 resources management, financial 
management, SCM, CRM, and manufacturing. 
SECTION A: 
 systems play a 
key role in helping organizations achieve goals, which are set 
forth in a(n) 
 statement. Computers can be 
used by people at all levels of an organization. Workers use 
information systems to produce and manipulate information. 
Managers depend on information ­systems to supply data that 
is essential for long-term 
 planning and 
short-term tactical planning. Transaction 
 
systems provide an organization with a way to collect, display, 
modify, or cancel transactions. These systems encompass 
activities such as general accounting, inventory tracking, and 
ecommerce. 
 information systems 
typically build on the data collected by a TPS to produce 
reports that managers use to make the business decisions 
needed to solve routine, structured problems. A decision 
 system helps workers and managers 
make non-routine decisions by constructing decision models 
that include data collected from internal and external sources. 
A(n) 
 system is designed to analyze data 
and produce a recommendation or decision based on a set of 
facts and rules called a(n) 
 base. These 
facts and rules can be written using an expert system shell or a 
programming language. A(n) 
 engine eval-
uates the facts and rules to produce answers to questions posed 
to the system. Using a technique called 
 
logic, these systems can deal with imprecise data and problems 
that have more than one solution.

Section C: The process of planning and build-
ing an information system is referred to as systems 
 and design, based on a system develop-
ment 
 cycle (SDLC), which consists 
of several phases. A project team can use one of several 
approaches to the system development process. For exam-
ple, the 
 methodology focuses on 
the processes that take place in an information system. 
The information 
 methodology 
focuses on the data that an information system collects. The 
object- 
 methodology treats an infor-
mation system as a collection of interacting objects. A proj-
ect begins with a(n) 
 phase. In this 
phase, the project team is assembled and creates a proj-
ect 
 plan containing a justification of 
the project and an initial project schedule. The project team 
then proceeds to the 
 phase, with the goal 
of producing a list of requirements for a new or revised infor-
mation system. These requirements are sometimes called 
 factors. The team uses documenta-
tion tools, such as data 
 diagrams and 
 case diagrams. 
SECTION D: In the 
 phase of 
the SDLC, the project team identifies potential software 
solutions, such as the use of programming languages, 
application 
 tools, or application 
software. A(n) 
 system might offer a 
complete hardware and software solution. When the solu-
tion requires custom programming, a(n) 
 
design phase produces specifications that describe the way 
the new information system should interact with users, store 
data, process data, and format reports. Development can be 
derailed by unmanaged 
 creep, so 
the team should have a formal system of change requests. 
During the 
 phase of the SDLC, the 
project team supervises the technicians who set up new hard-
ware, install programming languages and other applica-
tion 
 tools, create and test applications, 
and customize software. The team also finalizes the sys-
tem documentation and trains users. In this phase, three 
types of testing ensure that new software works correctly. 
 testing is performed on each mod-
ule, and then 
 testing is performed 
to make sure that all the modules work together correctly. 
 testing ensures that the software 
components work correctly on the hardware and with other, 
perhaps older, elements of the information system. Four 
types of information system go-live conversions are pos-
sible: direct, parallel, phased, or pilot. At the end of the con-
version process, the information system undergoes a final 
test called 
 testing, designed to assure 
the system’s owner that the new system works as specified. 
After testing and installation, an information system enters the 
 phase of its life cycle.  
SECTION E: To protect data from being destroyed by nat-
ural disasters, human errors, and other factors, enterprises often 
house their information systems in private 
 
centers or shared 
 centers. Enterprises 
also have 
 recovery plans in place that 
contain step-by-step methods to secure data against threats, 
recover lost data, and resume operations after a disruption. 
Enterprises strive to prevent data 
 , 
in which personal data is viewed, accessed, or retrieved 
without authorization. 
 reduce the 
likelihood of deliberate attack. 
 counter-
measures shield vulnerabilities to render an attack unsuccessful. 
 procedures reduce the effect of an attack. 
 activities recognize attacks and trigger a 
corrective response. Unauthorized access to corporate informa-
tion systems is a primary source of 
 theft. 
Although consumers have little control over data that is stored on 
corporate systems, they can take steps to protect their identity by 
placing a(n) 
 alert on their credit reports.

Interactive Situation Questions
6 6 6 	
 Unit 9
1.	
Suppose that you own a small bookstore located in a 
mall. Business seems to be declining, and you suspect 
that many of your former customers are now shopping at 
online bookstores. What can you do about declining sales? 
You realize that this situation falls into the category of a(n) 
 problem, and you might not be able 
to solve it by using the data supplied by your MIS. 
2.	
Your friend just graduated and started working in a local 
pharmacy. She tells you about the pharmacy’s computer 
system that warns of dangerous drug interactions 
by examining the patient’s prescription record and 
sometimes asking the pharmacist to enter age and 
allergy information. The system that she has been 
describing sounds like a(n) 
 system.
3.	
The shelves in your local Target store are looking a 
little sparse because the dock workers’ union is on 
strike. At Target’s headquarters, managers are using 
 applications to plan the most 
efficient distribution logistics for when the strike ends. 
4.	
As a member of the IT staff at a large corporation, you 
often hear about problems with the current information 
system. One recently discovered problem is that when 
an employee quits (or gets fired), sometimes the network 
manager is not notified, and the former employee 
continues to have access to company data over the 
Internet. Using the PIECES framework, you would 
classify this as a(n) 
 problem. 
5.	
Your county provides online access to property records. 
You simply enter the address of the property or the 
owner’s name into the site’s search engine. However, 
each search seems to take longer than one minute. 
According to the PIECES framework, this delay would be 
classified as a(n) 
 problem.
6.	
You just received an email from Starbucks that says: 
“Congratulations, you’ve achieved enough stars for 
Green level, so you now get free in-store refills.” This 
message was likely sent from a(n) 
 
application that tracks Starbucks customers. (Hint: Use 
the acronym.)
7.	
You just started working in the IT department at a very 
small company that’s developing a new information 
system. Your coworkers are trying to track down a 
discrepancy that resulted from a change in the name of 
a data field. Although you don’t say it, you realize that 
such a problem would not have occurred if the project 
team had used 
 tools. (Hint: Use the 
acronym.)
8.	
On your last job, you worked as an admitting clerk in 
a hospital. One day, you were told to begin using the 
hospital’s new information system. The next day, you 
were told to go back to using the old system until further 
notice. You suspect that these events occurred as a 
result of a failed attempt at a(n) 
 
conversion.

Operational and Analytical Databases
Databases are an essential aspect of modern life. Most businesses could 
not function without them, and they are the backbone of popular Internet 
services such as iTunes, Facebook, Twitter, and eBay. Section A begins the 
unit with an overview of databases and the many ways they are used today. 
	What is a database? In its broadest definition, a database is a collec-
tion of information. Today, most databases are stored as computer files. A 
database can be a simple list of names and email addresses, or it can be 
a much more extensive compilation of data, such as Google’s collection of 
user queries. Databases can even incorporate several lists. For example, 
the database for an ecommerce site, such as Amazon.com, includes inven-
tory lists and customer lists. 
Databases are created and managed by individuals and organizations. The 
tasks associated with creating, maintaining, and accessing the information 
in databases are referred to as data management, file management, or 
database management. 
	How are databases classified? Databases are classified in several 
ways. They can be classified based on whether they are maintained by 
individuals or organizations. They can also be classified by their structure, 
which is a topic covered later in this section. One of the most basic ways to 
classify databases distinguishes whether they are used for everyday busi-
ness operations or for analytical purposes. 
Depending on their purpose and use, databases can be classified as opera-
tional databases or analytical databases. An operational database is used 
to collect, modify, and maintain data on a daily basis. An analytical data-
base is used to collect data that will be used for spotting trends that offer 
insights for tactical and strategic business decisions. Figure 10-1 explains 
the differences between these two types of databases.
Figure 10-1: Operational and analytical databases 
Operational databases are commonly part 
of an enterprise’s TPS, OLTP, CRM, SCM, or 
ERP information systems. 
They store data as it is collected from 
point-of-sale systems, customer loyalty 
programs, social media signups, and other 
transactions. 
The data is typically dynamic. 
It changes constantly and 
reflects up-to-the-minute 
information. 
Analytical databases commonly hold 
historical data copied from one or more 
transaction processing systems. 
Unlike an operational database, the 
data in an analytical database is not 
being constantly updated. Therefore, it 
remains relatively static.
Because the data is his-
torical, the information 
that can be inferred is like 
a snapshot of a point in 
time.

SECTION A, Unit 10
	What are the main activities associated with operational 
databases? Operational databases collect and store data so that it can be 
viewed, updated, organized, and distributed. These activities are generally 
carried out by the organization that operates the database. Depending on 
the purpose of the information system that the database supports, consum-
ers may also participate in these activities. In the following list of activities, 
the examples illustrate various entities that may have access to the data in 
an operational database.
Collect and store data. A database is a collection of data that grows as 
additional data is obtained. Data can be gathered by devices that process 
transactions and information systems that generate digital records to track 
inventory and similar physical objects. Consumers add data to databases 
when they carry out activities such as making purchases and subscribing to 
social media sites. 
View data. Access to databases is usually limited to authorized users. 
Those users may be employees of the organization that maintains the 
database, but third parties may also be granted access. Usually, access 
rights include limitations. For example, consumers may be able to access 
their own bank account data, but they are not allowed to access data in 
other accounts. Even in-house workers may have limited access, as when 
a customer support technician is allowed access to information about a 
customer’s device that is malfunctioning, but the technician is not allowed 
access to the customer’s payment data.
Find data. Databases make it easy to locate information. Library patrons 
can use an online public access catalog (OPAC) to find books. A pharmacist 
can check a pharmaceutical database for drug interactions before filling a 
prescription. A computer technician can check a manufacturer’s database to 
find the part number for replacing your computer’s fried hard drive. Searches 
can be used to find a specific piece of data, or they can be used as filters to 
view a subset of data that meets certain criteria. An iTunes search for Blues, 
for example, acts as a filter to list a specific type of music (Figure 10-2).
Figure 10-2: Searches can be used as filters to view a subset of data 
A search for Blues 
acts as a filter to 
produce music tracks 
in the blues genre.

Update data. One of the primary activities of database management is 
keeping data up to date by entering current addresses, inventory quantities, 
new account passwords, and so on. Data entry errors can produce database 
inaccuracies, which are not always easy to correct. Horror stories about data 
entry errors abound, including tales of individuals—very much alive—whose 
records were mistakenly marked “deceased” and victims of identity theft who 
had trouble restoring their credit ratings. Data errors may originate within an 
information system or from external entities, such as consumers. To prevent 
errors, information systems include validation routines. You’ll learn more 
about this topic later in the unit.
Organize data. The data in a typical database is stored in no particular 
order. New data is appended to the end of the file because it is too cumber-
some to insert it in, for example, alphabetical order, and then rearrange all 
the records that come after it. Reports created with this jumble of raw data 
would not be particularly useful. To turn data into a more suitable report, 
it can be organized in a variety of ways. It can be alphabetized, placed in 
numeric order, grouped, and subtotaled. 
Distribute data. Databases—combined with mail merge and other com-
puterized technologies—offer efficient ways to distribute information to 
customers, employees, the press, government agencies, and other compa-
nies. For example, your monthly electric bill is generated from the power 
company’s database. That recall notice you received about the braking sys-
tem in your six-month-old car, your monthly bank statement, and your class 
schedule for next semester all are generated from databases. 
Unfortunately, databases also generate mountains of Publishers Clearing 
House mailings and an irritating amount of v1agr*a spam that lands in your 
email Inbox. Today’s digital databases are much more portable than old-
fashioned paper-based databases, but the convenience of digital formats 
makes computer databases easier to misuse. 
Spammers, junk mailers, and telemarketers pay only a fraction of a penny 
for each name on a mailing or call list. Millions of records can be easily 
copied, sent over the Internet, and stored on an external hard drive, a USB 
flash drive, or in the cloud. The U.S. legal system has yet to iron out details 
regarding database ownership and under what conditions it is allowable to 
share database data. 
Move or remove data. Information can be removed from a database when 
it is no longer needed. Keeping a database lean can speed up searches and 
conserve storage space. Historical data can be valuable, however. Rather 
than deleting old data, it can be moved to a data archive. As a consumer, 
you should be aware that records can remain in databases and archives for 
years after transactions have been completed—even after your name has 
been “removed” or your records are designated as “inactive” (Figure 10-3).

	What are the main activities associated with analytical 
databases? Analytical databases store data that is used by corporate 
executives, strategic planners, and other workers to examine sales perfor-
mance, inventory levels, and other business metrics. Although it is possible 
to extract analytical data from operational databases, analytical databases 
are structured to provide analytics more efficiently and flexibly. Decision 
makers can access analytical databases using an executive dashboard, 
provided by software such as iDashboards, which includes tools for visu-
ally displaying query results (Figure 10-4).
Analytical databases contain data that is periodically copied from opera-
tional databases. For example, every month, data pertaining to sales of 
men’s, women’s, and children’s shoes might be copied from a Zappos.com 
transaction processing system to an analytical database so executives can 
make inferences about customer gender, age, and buying habits. 
Databases designed for analytical activities are generally used by in-house 
employees. Consequently, consumers rarely interact with analytical data-
bases.
Analytical databases also differ from operational databases in that they are 
read-only. The data they contain is static and cannot typically be changed, 
modified, or deleted. For example, an executive would not be able to change 
a customer’s order from within an analytical database. In some ways, it is 
similar to how Google works—you can query the Google database, but you 
cannot change the data it contains.
The data in an analytical database can be used for a variety of activities, 
such as data mining, predictive analytics, and OLAP.

Find relationships and patterns. Data mining refers to computer 
algorithms that analyze information to discover previously unknown and 
potentially useful information, including relationships and patterns. The data 
accessed by data mining and other analysis techniques is often stored 
in a data warehouse, which can be a repository for data from more than 
one database. A repository for data mining is created by transferring data 
from operational databases to a data warehouse where it can be com-
bined with data from other databases.
Data mining can reveal relationships that might not be expected or antic-
ipated. For example, an analysis of over 10 million policies and accident 
claims in the Farmers Insurance Group data warehouse revealed that mar-
ried baby boomers who owned a full-size car or minivan in addition to a 
sports car tended to make far fewer insurance claims than younger, unmar-
ried sports car owners. As a result of the data analysis, lower insurance 
rates were offered to sports car owners who fit the low-risk profile. 
Make predictions. Predictive analytics refers to a branch of data mining 
that analyzes current and historical data to predict future trends. It makes 
use of statistical algorithms and optimization research to discover pat-
terns in data. For example, predictive analytics might help predict customer 
behavior, unmask terrorists, forecast storm paths, or determine genetic 
susceptibility to certain diseases. Like data mining, predictive analytics pro-
cesses data autonomously, rather than under the direction of an operator 
who specifies what to look for. 
Data mining and predictive analytics are sometimes criticized for finding 
relationships, patterns, and trends where none actually exist. The misuse of 
data mining is sometimes called data dredging or data fishing.
Examine multiple factors. OLAP (online analytical processing) is a data 
analysis technique used by decision makers to quickly get answers to com-
plex queries that encompass multiple factors, such as locations, revenue, 
time periods, and employee status. Unlike data mining and predictive ana-
lytics, OLAP is an interactive process that allows decision makers to devise 
on-the-fly queries, enter them, and get an immediate response.
Suppose, for example, that a college administrator wants to keep track of 
student applications and admissions to see which departments are meet-
ing enrollment goals based on the number of new students admitted and 
their test scores. An OLAP query can access information from the admis-
sions office along with data from the college’s student records database 
(Figure 10-5).

Database Models
Data can exist as a jumble of files, folders, images, and sounds, or it can be 
shaped and molded into a more structured format. Trying to fit diverse snip-
pets of data into a uniform mold might increase access efficiency, but there 
can be costs and tradeoffs. Database designers always face a basic ques-
tion: “What is the best structure for this data?”
	What is the underlying structure of a database? Computer 
databases evolved from manual filing systems. A filing cabinet full of fold-
ers and papers would be classified as an unstructured file because every 
document has a unique structure and contains different kinds of data. 
In a box of unstructured documents, you could find old receipts, photos, 
product brochures, and handwritten letters. The electronic equivalent to this 
jumble of information might be the collection of documents and graphics 
stored at a social media Web site. 
In contrast to a collection of dissimilar information, library card catalogs and 
Rolodexes would be classified as structured files. A structured file uses a 
uniform format to store data for each person or thing in the file. Many of the 
databases used in business, ecommerce, and government are stored as 
structured files. 
The underlying structure of a database is referred to as a database model. 
There are several types of database models, each with a unique way of 
storing data. Database models such as flat files and relational tables are 
commonly used today, whereas hierarchical models are becoming obsolete. 
Other models such as graph and multidimensional databases are just begin-
ning to develop a track record. Let’s see what these models are all about.
	What’s the simplest way to store data? One of the simplest mod-
els for storing data is a flat file that consists of a single, two-dimensional 
table of data elements. Each row in the table is a record, and each column 
in the table is a field. Spreadsheets are stored as flat files displayed as rows 
and columns. Flat files are also the foundation for simple databases, such 
as an email address book or an iTunes playlist (Figure 10-6).

Each row contains the 
data for one record.

	What are the basic elements of a flat file? A field contains the 
smallest unit of meaningful information, so you might call it the basic build-
ing block for a structured file or database. Each field has a unique field 
name that describes its contents. For example, in an iTunes playlist, the 
field called Name holds the name of a song, the Time field holds the song 
length, the Artist field holds the name of the performer, the Album field holds 
the name of the album that the song came from, and the Genre field holds 
the type of song. 
A field can be variable length or fixed length. A variable-length field is like 
an accordion—it expands to fit the data you enter, up to some maximum 
number of ­characters. A fixed-length field contains a predetermined num-
ber of characters (bytes). The data you enter in a fixed-length field cannot 
exceed the allocated field length. Moreover, if the data you enter is shorter 
than the allocated length, blank spaces are automatically added to fill the 
field. The fields in Figure 10-7 are fixed length. The underscores indicate the 
number of characters allocated for each field.

In the world of databases, a record refers to a ­collection of data fields. 
You’re already familiar with several types of records, such as student 
records, medical records, and dental records. Each record stores data 
about one entity—a person, place, thing, or event. For example, a data 
record stored in an iTunes playlist contains fields of data pertaining to a 
digital music track. 
The template for a record is referred to as a record type. It contains field 
names, but no data. Creating record types is part of the design process 
that lets database designers specify the information needed to complete 
each record. A record type, similar to a blank form, is usually shown without 
any data in the fields. A record that contains data is referred to as a record 
occurrence, or simply a record (Figure 10-8).

SECTION A, Unit 10
	Why would a database need to keep track of relationships? 
Each record in a flat file is an independent entity, and no relationships can be 
established between records. For example, you can’t set up links between 
all of The Beatles’ songs in your iTunes playlist. If you are listening to A Hard 
Day’s Night, you can’t automatically link to The Beatles’ next-most-popular 
song. 
In database jargon, a relationship is an association between data that’s 
stored in different record types. Relationships are important because 
there are associations among the real-life things that database records 
represent. The iTunes Store maintains a database with information about 
albums, tracks, and recording artists. Its database also contains informa-
tion about customers. There are several important relationships within the 
database, such as the tracks that are related to each album and the cus-
tomers related to albums they have purchased.
An important aspect of the relationship between record types is cardinality. 
Cardinality refers to the number of associations that can exist between 
two record types. For example, many albums can be classified as being 
part of the Rap genre. The reverse is not true, however. An iTunes album 
can have only one genre; it can’t be classified as both Rap and Classical. 
The relationship between record types can be depicted graphically with an 
entity-relationship diagram (sometimes called an ER diagram or ERD). 
Figure 10-9 shows ERDs for one-to-many, many-to-many, and one-to-one 
relationships.

	What kinds of databases track relationships? Many database 
models keep track of relationships among data, but there are different 
techniques for doing so. For example, a hierarchical database allows one-
to-one and one-to-many relationships, which are linked in a hierarchical 
structure (Figure 10-10). 
Although hierarchical databases offer lightning-quick searches and utilize a 
minimum amount of disk space for storage, they are rarely used today for 
business, consumer, and other mainstream database applications. Instead, 
they remain in use only for specialized applications. Windows uses a hierar-
chical database to store Registry data that keeps track of the software and 
hardware configuration of your PC. 
A graph database offers an alternative way to track relationships. The struc-
ture of these databases resembles sociograms with their interlinked nodes. 
As you might expect, such databases are useful for storing data generated 
on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms. A graph database 
includes nodes, edges, and properties, as shown in Figure 10-11.

	What’s a relational database? A relational database stores data 
in a collection of related tables. Each table is a sequence of records, 
similar to a flat file. All the records in a table are of the same record type. 
Each row of a table is equivalent to a record. Each column of a table is 
equivalent to a field. 
Most relational databases contain several tables. For example, suppose 
a store called Vintage Music sells vinyl records both from a mall-based 
store and online. The store might use five tables to store data, as shown 
in Figure 10-12.

In a relational database, relationships are specified by joining common data 
stored in records from different tables. Suppose customers want to know 
which tracks are included in the Elvis Presley album G.I. Blues. The Albums 
table does not include this information. Figure 10-13 illustrates how a rela-

	What’s a multidimensional database? A multidimensional 
database organizes relationships over three or more dimensions. In 
the context of databases, a dimension is simply a layer based on a data 
element, such as a product, place, or customer, that can be used to cat-
egorize data. 
Multidimensional databases can have any number of dimensions; but 
when there are more than seven dimensions, the models become difficult 
to work with. Multidimensional databases are often illustrated as a cube 
with three dimensions like the one in Figure 10-14, which has dimen-
sions for age, location, and music preference.
A key element of multidimensional databases is their ability to support 
OLAP queries that make it possible to combine data, drill down to specif-
ics, or slice and dice the data to view it from different perspectives. Each 
cube in the multidimensional model can produce multiple facts. So the red 
cube in Figure 10-14 not only could tell you how many young rap fans there 
are in California, but also could produce information about their disposable 
incomes and buying habits.
Multidimensional databases are used in data warehouses, where data 
from operational databases is aggregated and transformed to make it 
more useful for analytical queries. For example, suppose that the Vintage 
Music relational database does not include a field for a customer’s musi-
cal preference. This missing field could be added by moving data into the 
multidimensional database and generating data for a dimension called 
MusicPreference based on the kinds of music each customer has pur-
chased in the past.

SECTION A, Unit 10
	What’s an object database? An object database, also referred 
to as an object-oriented database, stores data as objects, which can 
be grouped into classes and defined by attributes and methods. The 
Programming unit in this text covers object-oriented terminology in detail; 
but in the context of object databases, a class defines a group of objects, 
such as customers or albums. 
Classes are described by attributes and methods. The attributes for an 
object are equivalent to fields in a relational database. For example, 
a class called Orders might have attributes such as OrderNumber, 
OrderDate, CustomerNumber, and OrderedAlbums. 
A method is any behavior that an object is capable of performing. A 
method called CheckInventory can be defined for this class. Its job is to 
make sure an album is in stock. 
	What are the advantages of object databases? Object data-
bases excel at representing objects that have slightly different attributes, 
which is the case in many real-world business applications. 
Vintage Music accepts phone orders and Web orders. These two types of 
orders differ slightly because an email address is used to communicate 
with Web customers, whereas a telephone number and the order clerk’s 
name need to be recorded for customers who order by phone. 
In this scenario, a relational database would require two record types, 
but an object database can be set up so that the Orders class has two 
derivative classes: one for Web customers and one for phone customers. 
Figure 10-15 illustrates classes, derivative classes, and methods in an 
object database.

An object database can easily store data about different types of orders. A class called Orders holds 
data and methods common to all types of orders. A derivative class called Phone Orders inherits all the 
characteristics of Orders, but it has attributes and methods unique to orders placed by telephone. Web 
Orders is a derivative class that has attributes and methods unique to orders placed over the Web.

	What is a document database? A document-oriented database 
stores unstructured data, such as the text of a speech or a magazine article. 
Because these articles are of varying lengths and structure, it is not possible 
to mold them into a hierarchical, relational, or object structure. So, instead 
of molding the data to fit a database structure, document databases are 
created by inserting structural markups similar to HTML into the documents 
themselves. Two popular ways of formatting document databases are with 
XML and JSON, though XML offers more flexibility.
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) allows field tags, data, and tables to 
be incorporated into a document. It was developed in response to several 
deficiencies that became apparent as HTML gained widespread use. A 
database of historic speeches might be stored in XML format, allowing que-
ries to locate speeches related to specific orators, dates, and places (Figure 
10-16).

DATAbase Tool Basics
There’s an old saying, “Don’t use a sledgehammer to crack a nut,” which 
means “Use the right tool for the job.” Database tools range from enterprise-
wide, multi-module information system suites to handy features tucked 
away in application software and social media apps. Section B will help you 
to determine which database tools are suitable for managing personal data 
and which are appropriate for enterprise tasks.
	Is it easy to retrieve data from files? Back when information sys-
tems emerged as important business tools, data was stored in ASCII files 
and programmers created custom software modules to access that data. 
It is still possible to create custom software to accommodate flat files and 
other database models. Today, however, custom software is rarely created 
to manage databases because a good variety of off-the-shelf tools are 
available. These tools are professionally designed to be efficient and avoid 
problems produced by data dependence.
Data dependence is a term that refers to data and program modules being 
so tightly ­interrelated that they become difficult to modify. Imagine a data-
base in which program modules and data all exist in one large file! It would 
be impossible to access the data while editing any of the ­program modules. 
Furthermore, changing the file structure in any way might make the mod-
ules unusable.
Modern database tools ­support data independence, which entails sepa-
rating data from the programs that manipulate data. As a result, a single 
data management tool can be used to maintain many different files and 
databases. In addition, standard search, sort, and print routines continue to 
function, regardless of changes to field names or record structure.
	What kinds of database tools are available? Simple tools for 
managing consumer-level databases, such as contact lists and research 
bibliographies, can be found in dedicated application software, word pro-
cessing and spreadsheet software, and database management software. 
Database tools designed for enterprise-level tasks can be more expensive 
and more complex. The table in Figure 10-17 provides a quick classification 
of the database tools covered in the rest of this section.

considered beneficial by 
database designers?

SECTION b, Unit 10
Dedicated Applications
Individuals commonly have several personal databases, such as a con-
tact list, a collection of photos, or a record of checkbook transactions. 
Enterprises tend to have more extensive databases containing terabytes or 
even petabytes of data. The tools required to manage small personal data-
bases differ from enterprise data management tools. 
	Are simple data management tools available? Yes. The sim-
plest tools for managing data are dedicated applications for specific data 
management tasks, such as keeping track of appointments or maintaining 
an address book. To use one of these tools, simply enter your data. The 
software includes menus that allow you to manipulate the data after it is 
entered.
Although dedicated applications are easy to use, they generally don’t allow 
much flexibility because the record types are predefined. The apps shown 
in Figure 10-18 are handy, but they don’t allow users to add fields or change 
field names.
Figure 10-18: some Dedicated apps access databases 
Some dedicated tools do offer a choice of fields. As Figure 10-19 shows, 
users can select the fields they want to use for storing data in Apple’s iCloud 
Contacts application.

	What kinds of dedicated data management tools are used 
in enterprise information systems? The previous unit presented an 
overview of key enterprise applications, such as CRM, ERP, SCM, and 
ecommerce, that collect transactions in a database. These important busi-
ness management tools are generally sold as application modules that 
include the structure to hold data and the routines to query, view, add, mod-
ify, delete, and analyze the data. 
	How much flexibility do these enterprise tools offer? Like 
dedicated applications for managing personal databases, enterprise appli-
cations offer limited flexibility. The field types are predefined to coincide 
with the application. For example, an inventory application will have pre-
defined fields such as Item Number, Description, Quantity on Hand, Reorder 
Level, Supplier, and Cost. In contrast, an SCM application might have 
fields such as CustomerID, MaterialsBill, CarrierID, Route, ArrivalTime, and 
TrackingNumber. Clearly, the database tables set up for an inventory system 
are not suitable for SCM, so a unique data structure is required for each.
Enterprise applications tend to have some flexibility for customization, 
which allows field names to be modified to reflect business practices. For 
example, changing the MaterialsBill field name to OrderNumber might make 
more sense to workers. Such changes, however, are typically made only to 
the forms that are displayed on screens or printed. 
Making core changes to a database can easily break the connections that 
form relationships between tables. For example, if the MaterialsBill field is 
used as a link between customers and shippers, renaming the field in only 
one table would sever the relationship to the other table. 
The bottom line is that dedicated enterprise applications may allow cosmetic 
changes, but they do not encourage modifications of core data structures. 
There are exceptions. For example, the Microsoft Dynamics CRM online 
application allows modifications, including new fields and processes (Figure 
10-20). 
Figure 10-20: Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
Entities and their fields 
can be customized.
Displayed name
Defined name
Microsoft Dynamics CRM allows its database to be customized by adding, 
deleting, and modifying entities and their attributes. It is easy, for example, to 
modify the display name for a field.

SECTION b, Unit 10
Word Processor data tools
Word processing software is designed to produce documents, but it also 
may include tools for working with unstructured or structured data. These 
tools can sort a simple list or create a file of data for mail merges. 
	What can a word processor sort? Most word processing software 
includes a sort feature that can be used to arrange a simple list in alpha-
betical or numeric order. This feature is the most primitive data management 
tool, suitable for a limited amount of data. 
Sorting can come in handy for alphabetizing a list of contacts or sorting the 
entries in a bibliography. Sorting tools can usually be applied to paragraphs 
of text, so they can be used to arrange glossaries and indexes. They can 
also be used to sort the contents of tables and text that is arranged in col-
umns separated by tabs.
	How does a sort work? A sort rearranges information in a speci-
fied order, numerically or alphabetically. Sorts can be in ascending order 
(beginning with 1 or a) or in descending order. Multi-level sorts may also be 
possible. 
A single-level sort uses only one field to arrange records. A multi-level 
sort arranges information by more than one field. For example, suppose 
that baseball player statistics are arranged in a tabular format with columns 
for players, teams, and batting statistics. A single-level sort can arrange the 
athletes by team, but a multi-level sort is required to arrange the data alpha-
betically so that within each team, the athlete’s names are in alphabetical 
order. Figure 10-21 illustrates how to carry out a multi-level sort in Microsoft 
Word. 
Figure 10-21: Microsoft Word has a sort feature 
Players are sorted by team (Field 2) and 
within each team by name (Field 1).
The fields selected in the Sort 
by box specify the order.
Although a word processor can store data for a sports team and sort it in vari-
ous ways, it is not a suitable tool for carrying out mathematical operations or 
statistical analysis.

	What is mail merge? Mail merge creates customized documents by 
combining a template with a data source. Mail merge technology is used to 
produce mass-mailing campaigns for sweepstakes and political campaigns. 
It can be useful for sending out employment query letters, personalized invi-
tations, and customized holiday greetings.
Mail merge is a feature supplied by several word processors. What makes 
it a useful database tool is its associated data file. This file can be used as a 
mini-database for storing contacts, collectibles, or shipping labels—any list 
that is useful as a flat file and doesn’t contain a huge number of items.
	How does mail merge work? A mail merge requires two compo-
nents. The first is a document that contains placeholders where custom 
data is to be inserted. The placeholders are field names such as SALUT 
and LAST. The second component is a list of data with corresponding fields, 
such as LAST: Moore and LAST: Diego. Microsoft Word combines these 
two components using the five-step mail merge routine shown in Figure 
10-22.

SECTION B, Unit 10
Spreadsheet data tools
Spreadsheets are organized in table format, so it makes sense that they can 
be used for storing data. They offer an easy-to-use starting point, and users 
who outgrow a spreadsheet’s data-handling capabilities can transfer data to 
more sophisticated database software. 
	Can I use spreadsheet software for databases? Most spread-
sheet software also includes basic data management features. It’s quite 
easy to create simple flat files using a spreadsheet. 
Depending on the spreadsheet software, it may be possible to sort records, 
validate data, search for records, perform simple statistical functions, and 
generate graphs based on the data. Figure 10-23 illustrates Microsoft Excel 
data management functions applied to a family’s health records.
The ribbon provides access to 
data manipulation commands, 
such as Sort and Filter.
Excel stores data 
in a table, where 
each row can 
be treated as a 
record and each 
column as a field.
In addition to displaying 
records in a table, Excel 
can display one record 
at a time in form view.
	What are the limitations of using spreadsheets and word 
processors to manage data? Simple file management tools provided 
by word processing and spreadsheet ­software are popular for individu-
als who want to maintain flat files that contain ­hundreds, not ­thousands, 
of records. These tools work well for a simple address book, an inventory 
of household goods, a record of health care costs, and a variety of other 
simple lists. 
These basic tools do not, however, offer database capabilities for establish-
ing relationships between different record types, and they are not powerful 
enough to maintain the large volume of records required for business infor-
mation systems. As a guideline, use word processor data tools only for very 
simple lists and mail merges with fewer than 100 recipients. Use spread-
sheets to manage data that may contain numeric quantities and hundreds, 
not thousands, of records. For larger collections of data, database software 
offers better management features.

database management systems
There are situations in which a word processor or spreadsheet is not suf-
ficient to handle a dataset, but a dedicated ERP, CRM, or SCM application 
is either too expensive or does not meet business needs. Designing a data-
base from scratch and creating all the software necessary to access it is a 
complex and costly project. A DBMS offers a set of development tools for 
creating and accessing databases. 
	What is a DBMS? The term DBMS (database management system) 
refers to software that manages data stored in a database. It includes routines 
to define the structure of a database, including its fields and relationships. A 
DBMS allows developers to set up applications that collect and process data 
from point-of-sale terminals, ecommerce Web sites, handheld data gathering 
devices, or the Internet of Things. It also offers routines for defining how data 
is displayed on the screen and in printed reports.
Developers can use a DBMS to create almost any application that revolves 
around a collection of data. It can be used for consumer-level applications, 
such as tracking player statistics for a local sports league or managing a 
nonprofit organization’s fund-raising campaigns. Small businesses might 
use a DBMS to manage client billing or for scheduling projects. At the enter-
prise level, DBMSs are used to keep records pertaining to employees and 
compliance, sales leads, inventories, job costs, and just about every other 
aspect of business operations.
A variety of database management tools are available. Some of these tools 
are easy to use and require very little technical expertise, whereas others 
are designed for professional database developers.
	Which DBMS tools are easiest to use? FileMaker Pro and Microsoft 
Access are easy-to-use DBMSs that are a good fit for small businesses and 
individuals whose data can’t be efficiently handled as a flat file spreadsheet. 
These DBMSs include all the tools necessary to manipulate data in a data-
base, specify relationships, create data entry forms, query the database, 
and generate reports. They also have customizable starter templates for 
common types of databases (Figure 10-24).

SECTION b, Unit 10
	What about DBMS tools for professional developers? Four 
DBMS vendors are the first stop for professional developers: IBM, Oracle, 
SAS, and SAP. All of these vendors offer a range of modules that can be 
assembled like LEGOs to accommodate most database structures and stor-
age configurations. For example, snap the Database In-Memory module 
onto an existing Oracle Database module to build a lightning-fast transac-
tion processing system. Or snap in the Data Warehousing module to build 
applications for data analytics. 
Two open source DBMS products are also popular with database design-
ers. SQLite may be the world’s most widely used DBMS. It is included with 
all Android devices, where it is used by various apps. On iPhones, SQLite 
is used to store text messages. It is also integrated into popular browsers. 
MySQL is another popular open source DBMS. 
	What kinds of data can a DBMS work with? Modern DBMSs 
work with many kinds of data including text, numbers, images, PDFs, and 
audio files. The ability to work with many kinds of data is especially important 
in social media databases; but even in small businesses, the use of images, 
sound, and other data can be helpful. For example, a database for a commer-
cial landscaping business might include photos of the customer premises, a 
map to the property, and a copy of the work contract in addition to the usual 
contact details. Figure 10-25 illustrates how the DBMS might display a cus-
tomer’s information on an iPad used by the landscapers on the job. 
	Do DBMSs work with different database models? When build-
ing a database, one of the first design decisions is to determine which 
database model is the most appropriate. Although the relational database 
model is the most popular, for some applications, an object database, a 
graph database, or some other model might be preferable. 
Standard DBMSs offered by IBM, Oracle, SAP, and SAS are designed for 
relational databases. These tools are sometimes referred to as RDBMSs 
(relational DBMSs). They support the relational database model with data 
stored in tables that can be related to each other. Database tool vendors 
also offer products for other database models, such as document databases 
and graph databases. These alternative models and their associated devel-
opment tools are generally used for enterprise-class database installations.

	Does a DBMS take care of physical storage? Today, databases 
might reside on an in-house server, on a cloud-based server, or on distrib-
uted servers scattered throughout the world. DBMSs handle the details of 
how to most efficiently arrange data on a storage medium for optimal access 
speed.
Physical storage is not a trivial design concern. Consider a relational data-
base, such as iTunes, that is too large to efficiently run on a single server, so 
it is distributed across multiple servers. The DBMS has to adjust to the way 
data is distributed. For example, if the table containing cover art is housed 
on one server and the table of music tracks is housed on another server, the 
DBMS has to handle the data relationships across the two servers. It might 
do so by proactively fetching relationships in anticipation of their need, as 
shown in Figure 10-26. 
	How does a DBMS handle multiple users? Consider this scenario. 
Paul, a landscaper, is on the job site and talking to the client, who wants to 
change the lawn care day from Thursday to Friday. Paul attempts to enter 
this change into the database on his iPad. At the same time, Beth in the cor-
porate office is on the phone with the client’s partner, who wants to change 
the lawn care day to Monday. If both Paul and Beth attempt to enter this 
change into the system at the same time, what will happen?
Or, suppose that a Zappos.com customer places a pair of to-die-for shoes in 
her shopping cart. It is the last pair in her size. If she continues to shop, can 
another customer swoop in, choose the same pair of shoes, and purchase 
them before the first customer checks out?
Enterprise-class DBMSs can handle thousands of simultaneous users, and 
some of those users may at times attempt to modify the same record but 
in different ways. A DBMS feature known as serializability ensures that 
transactions are updated in an orderly manner by establishing update rules. 
Depending on the situation, a DBMS might allow only one user at a time 
to access a record; other users are locked out until the record is closed. 
Alternatively, the DBMS could allow any number of users to access a record 
in view-only mode while it is being modified. A more sophisticated rule might 
lock only the field that is being modified, rather than the entire record.

SECTION B, Unit 10
	Can a DBMS support multiple devices and operating sys-
tems? Managers, workers, customers, and clients that access databases 
use a wide array of devices, including mainframes, laptops, tablets, smart-
phones, and data collection devices such as point-of-sale scanners. These 
devices may use consumer operating systems such as Windows, Android, 
OS X, and iOS, or enterprise operating systems such as Linux, UNIX, 
Solaris, and BSD. 
A DBMS is installed on a specific in-house platform, such as Linux, or it 
runs as a cloud service hosted by the DBMS vendor. Once the DBMS 
is installed and set up, however, the database and applications can be 
extended to devices with other operating systems, allowing users to access 
the database using a client device such as a laptop, tablet, or smartphone. 
Client devices require database client software to access the information 
in a database. There are three types of database clients: local software, 
browsers, and apps.
Local database clients are installed on a local storage device, such as 
a hard disk or a USB drive. The installation process can be manual, or it 
can take place behind the scenes without any action required on the part 
of a consumer.
Installing a local database client provides access to the database without 
installing the entire DBMS. As an added advantage, local clients are much 
simpler to use and less expensive than a full-blown DBMS. Local clients 
are developed or customized by database designers and programmers.
Browsers are the most commonly used database clients. They are used 
by consumers to access online databases and ecommerce sites. Because 
browsers are standard software on virtually every digital device, no addi-
tional installation is necessary.
A browser accesses databases using HTML forms and JavaScript embed-
ded in Web pages. User queries are sent to the DBMS using HTTP calls. 
HTTP also returns query results, typically in the form of Web pages.
Apps are similar to local clients because they are installed locally. Their 
uniqueness is simply the fact that they are designed for mobile devices, 
which places restrictions on the user interface. Controls for entering que-
ries and viewing data must be large enough to function with ease on a 
touchscreen. Screen size may also limit the amount of data that can be 
viewed, so creative ways of presenting data through images and graphs 
are often used.

Defining Fields 
There are three core elements in a relational database: fields, tables, and 
relationships. These elements interlace to form the foundation of data that 
is used by operational and analytical information systems. If the database 
structure is designed correctly, information can be efficiently accessed and 
manipulated. A badly designed database can jeopardize an entire informa-
tion system.
	How does a database designer know what data to store? 
The term database structure refers to the arrangement of fields, tables, 
and relationships in a ­database. The first step in structuring a relational 
database is to determine what data should be collected and stored. To do 
so, a database designer might begin by consulting users and studying the 
current system to compile a list of available data as well as any additional 
data necessary to produce screen-based output or printed reports. 
Suppose that you are designing the database structure for Vintage Music, 
the business used in earlier examples. Initially, you would probably recog-
nize that data, such as album titles and artist names, should be collected for 
each of the vinyl records in the store’s inventory. Also, names, addresses, 
and order information should be collected for each customer. An initial list of 
the data to be collected might look something like Figure 10-28.
	How much data goes in each field? The Vintage Music database 
should store customer names, but should there be one field for first name 
and a separate field for last name? It is usually easy to break data into fields 
just by using common sense and considering how people might want to 
access the data. Any data that customers or store employees would want 
to search for, sort on, or use in a calculation should have its own field. By 
using a FirstName and a LastName field, or example, it will be possible to 
search for customers by last name, use just the customer’s first name in 
an email salutation, or combine the two fields for a shipping label (Figure 
10-29).

SECTION c, Unit 10
	Is there any data that should be left out? DBMSs and associated 
applications may be able to generate some data on the fly, and that data 
would not need to be stored in the database. For example, suppose Vintage 
Music has a VIP program that gives members a 10% discount. When VIP 
customers shop for albums at Vintage Music’s Web site, they see the regu-
lar price and the discounted price. The database, however, contains only 
one piece of pricing information: Price. The discounted price is not stored in 
the database. Instead, it is a computed field. 
A computed field is a calculation that a DBMS ­performs, similar to the 
way a spreadsheet computes a formula. The computation can be stored 
in a permanent field or generated on the fly and then temporarily stored in 
a memory location. An ­efficiently designed database uses computed fields 
whenever possible because they do not require manual data entry. Figure 
10-30 illustrates how a computed field produces the discounted price for a 
VIP customer.
Figure 10-30: computed fields are calculated on the fly 
	What makes each record unique? Although two people might have 
the same name, or two paychecks might contain the same amount, a com-
puter must have some way to differentiate between records. A primary key 
is a field that contains data unique to a record. 
Database designers commonly designate fields such as CustomerNumber, 
CheckNumber, SocialSecurityNumber, TelephoneNumber, and PartNumber 
as primary keys. 
As an alternative, the record number can be used as a primary key. A record 
number is assigned as each record is added. The first record in the data-
base is record number 1; the second record is record number 2, and so on. 
Although a record number is unique, it has no meaning in the context of the 
other data in a record. In contrast, a unique inventory number, for example, 
could correspond to an actual SKU or catalog number, so it has real-world 
meaning in the context of the data. In such a case, using the SKU or catalog 
number as the primary key would be preferable to using a record number.

	Can a database designer prevent people from enter-
ing inaccurate data? There’s an old saying in the computer industry: 
“garbage in, garbage out.” This adage is especially true when dealing with 
databases. The information produced by reports and processing routines 
is only as accurate as the information in the database. Unfortunately, data 
entry errors can compromise the accuracy and validity of a database. 
When designing a database, it is important to think ahead and envision 
potential data entry errors. Most DBMSs provide tools that database design-
ers can use to prevent some, but not all, data entry errors. 
	Do uppercase characters make a difference? People who 
enter data into a database sometimes have difficulty deciding whether to 
use uppercase or lowercase characters. In a case-sensitive database, 
uppercase letters are not equivalent to their lowercase counterparts. For 
example, in a case-sensitive database, the artist name Elvis is not equiva-
lent to elvis. 
Inconsistent use of case can lead to several problems. A search for elvis will 
not produce records for Elvis or ELVIS. Furthermore, in a sorted or indexed 
list, elvis and ELVIS might not be grouped together. 
Most DBMSs give database designers an option to turn case sensitivity on 
or off. Designers may also have the option to force data to all uppercase or 
all lowercase as it is entered. These techniques are not infallible solutions 
to the inconsistent use of case, but they can help to keep the dataset more 
uniform.
	How about entering numbers? A customer or data-entry opera-
tor might enter a telephone number as 555-555-7777, (555) 555-7777, 
or 1-555-555-7777. When numbers are entered in different formats, it 
becomes difficult to produce properly ­formatted reports or locate a particular 
telephone number. 
To prevent inconsistent formatting, a database designer can specify a field 
format. A field format is a template that adds the correct formatting as data 
is entered. If someone attempts to enter data in the wrong format, the data-
base can be set up to reject that entry or correct it. For example, a telephone 
number field might use a field format such as the one shown in Figure 10-31.
Figure 10-31: Field formats assist in data entry 
Telephone Number:
Telephone Number:
With this telephone number field 
format, you simply enter the num-
ber without any punctuation.
Typing 9035552378 
produces this result.

SECTION c, Unit 10
	Can a database prevent typos? People who enter data some-
times make a mistake and press the wrong keys. Preventing every 
typographical error is not possible. However, it is possible to catch some of 
these errors by using field validation rules, list boxes, or lookups. 
A field validation rule is a specification that the database designer sets up 
to filter data entered into a particular field. For example, the price of albums 
in the Vintage Music database ranges from $0 (for promotions) to $800. No 
albums have a value greater than $1000. When intending to enter $19.98 
in the value field, however, the omission of a decimal point could set the 
price of an album to $1998! 
When designing the Vintage Music database, a database designer can 
use a field validation rule to limit entries in the Price field to numbers less 
than $1000. If the DBMS receives a number such as 1998 in the Price 
field, it displays a message requesting the correct price. 
Another technique that prevents typographical and case-sensitivity errors is 
to limit data entry to the items on a specified list. For example, a customer 
living in Topeka might enter the state as Kansas, KANSAS, KS, Ks, or KA. 
However, most database software allows database designers to specify a 
list of acceptable entries for each field. You are probably familiar with click-
able lists of states, such as the one in Figure 10-32. 
Figure 10-32: clickable lists reduce data entry errors
Database designers can also prevent entry errors by using lookup routines. 
A lookup routine validates an entry by checking data in an in-house or 
third-party database. For example, many ecommerce sites check the ship-
ping address entered by customers against a list of valid addresses in the 
USPS database.

Data Types 
In addition to naming each field, a database designer specifies what sort of 
data the field can hold. Many fields will hold text, but other fields might hold 
numbers, dates, or images. The type of data in a field defines whether it can 
be used for calculations or as a search key. It can also affect the validity of 
data that is entered into the database. 
	How does a database designer know what data types to 
use? The data that can be entered into a field depends on the field’s data 
type. From a technical perspective, a data type specifies the way data is 
represented on physical storage media and in RAM. From a user perspec-
tive, the data type determines the way data can be manipulated. When 
designing a database, each field is assigned a data type. Most database 
management systems support a variety of data types, though some DBMSs 
may not support all of them. 
Real. There are several numeric data types, including real, integer, and 
date. Database designers assign the real data type to fields that contain 
numbers with decimal places, such as prices and percentages. 
Integer. The integer data type is used for fields that contain whole num-
bers—quantities, repetitions, rankings, and so on. Database designers use 
the integer data type unless the data requires decimal places because real 
numbers require more storage space. 
Date. As you might expect, the date data type is used to store dates in a for-
mat that allows them to be manipulated, such as when you want to calculate 
the number of days between two dates.
Text. The text data type is normally assigned to fixed-length fields that 
hold character data—people’s names, album titles, and so on. Text fields 
sometimes hold data that looks like numbers but won’t be mathematically 
manipulated. Telephone numbers, Social Security numbers, ZIP codes, 
and item numbers are examples of data that looks numeric but is normally 
stored in text fields.
Memo. A memo data type usually provides a variable-length field into which 
users can enter comments. For example, the Vintage Music database might 
contain a memo field for storing comments about a particular album, such 
as “Where Did Our Love Go was The Supremes’ first hit album.” 
Logical. The logical data type (sometimes called a Boolean or yes/no data 
type) is used for true/false and yes/no data, which requires minimal storage 
space. For example, a database designer might define a logical field called 
VIP, which would contain a Y if a customer has attained VIP status and is 
entitled to discounts. 
BLOB. Some file and database management systems also include addi-
tional data types, such as BLOBs and hyperlinks. A BLOB (binary large 
object) is a collection of binary data stored in a single field of a database. 
BLOBs can be just about any kind of data you would store as a file, such as 
an MP3 music track or an image of an album cover. 
Hyperlink. The hyperlink data type stores URLs used to link directly from a 
database to a Web page. For example, data stored in a hyperlink field of the 
Vintage Music database could provide a link to a musician’s Web site.

SECTION c, Unit 10
normalization
When the design process begins, a database designer roughly groups fields 
representing customers, inventory items, and other entities. These group-
ings, however, may not be optimal for fast access, analytics, or security. 
A challenging part of database design is to arrive at just the right group of 
fields for each database table.
	How does a database designer determine the best data 
groupings? A process called normalization helps database designers 
create a database structure that minimizes storage space and increases 
processing efficiency. The goal of normalization is to minimize data redun-
dancy—the amount of data that is duplicated in a database. 
Groupings usually correspond to the physical items or entities that are 
tracked in the database. Each normalized group becomes a table in the final 
database design. 
An initial examination of Vintage Music data reveals two groups: albums 
and customers. The albums group contains data about album titles, artists, 
and tracks. The customers group contains data about each customer and 
the orders they place. But is this the best grouping? To answer this ques-
tion, first take a look at a sample customer order in Figure 10-33.
	What’s the problem? If customer information and order informa-
tion are grouped in the same table, each time Jorge Rodriguez places an 
order, his name, shipping address, billing address, telephone number, and 
email address must be entered and stored. This data redundancy not only 
requires extra storage space, but it also could lead to storing inconsistent

	Is the problem solved? Even after separating customer data from 
order data, the structure of the Vintage Music database can be further 
normalized. The Orders table in the figure above allows ­customers to pur-
chase only one album per order because the fields Cat# and Price occur 
only once. Obviously, the Vintage Music database should be able to handle 
orders for more than one album. 
It might seem reasonable to provide several fields for the albums in an 
order. Perhaps they could be named AlbumNumber1, AlbumNumber2, 
AlbumNumber3, and so on. But how many of those fields should the data-
base designer provide? If the designer provides fields for ordering ten 
albums, the database still cannot handle large orders for more than ten 
albums. Furthermore, if a customer orders fewer than ten albums, space is 
wasted by having empty fields in each record. 
You might recognize that a one-to-many relationship exists between an 
order and the ordered items. That clue indicates that the database designer 
should separate the data into two tables, such as Orders and Order Details. 
These two tables are related by the OrderNumber field. Figure 10-35 illus-
trates how the Orders table is further ­normalized into two tables to store 
data more efficiently.

SECTION c, Unit 10
Sorting and Indexing
Records can be organized in ­different ways depending on how people 
want to use them. For example, Vintage Music customers will most often 
view the information in the Albums table by album title or artist name. The 
inventory manager usually wants the data sorted by the quantity in stock to 
easily see which albums are overstocked. No single way of organizing the 
data accommodates everyone’s needs, but the good news is tables can be 
sorted or indexed in multiple ways.
	What happens when the data in a table is sorted? A table’s 
physical sort order is the order in which records are arranged on stor-
age devices. A sort key is the column of data that is used as the basis 
for rearranging the data. Sorted tables produce faster queries and updates 
because they take advantage of clever algorithms that quickly pinpoint 
records. In a sorted table, new records are inserted to maintain the order. 
When no sort order is specified, new records are appended to the end of 
the file, resulting in a file that is not arranged in any particular order. Queries 
and updates within an unsorted database are slow because the only algo-
rithm for searching an unsorted table requires a sequential look at each 
record. 
Some DBMSs store records on a physical storage medium according to 
a predetermined sort order. The database designer usually specifies this 
order for each table at the time the database structure is created. Each 
table can have only one sort order at a time, but the order can be changed. 
However, changing the sort order can take a long time because the process 
physically rearranges records. In Figure 10-36, you can see how records 
might be arranged sequentially on a storage device.
Figure 10-36: sorting physically rearranges records on a storage device 
Sort key
The sort key for this data is the Catalog Number (Cat#). Data is stored on the 
disk as a continuous stream, which means that changing the sort key requires 
all the data to be physically rearranged.

 These records are sorted and stored by R# (Record Number), which is 
simply the order in which they were added to the database. 
 An index is created that will display the records in order by release date. 
The index contains only three fields, so it does not require much storage 
space. 
 The R# field is the pointer that connects each record in the Albums table 
with the index.
 The order of records listed in the R# column of the index indicates the 
order for displaying the records by release date. The first record in the 
table where R# is 1 will be the first record displayed because it has the 
earliest release date. The third record in the table will be displayed next, 
followed by the fourth record and the second record.
	How is indexing different from sorting? A database index can 
be used to organize data in alphabetical or numerical order. It is very 
similar to an index in a book that contains a list of keywords and pointers 
to the pages where they can be found. A database index contains a list 
of keys, and each key provides a pointer to the record that contains the 
rest of the fields related to that key. 
Unlike a sort order, an index has no bearing on the physical sequence of 
records on a storage device. An index simply points to the record where 
the data can be found. The advantage of an index over a sort is that a 
table can have multiple indexes but only one sort order. For example, the 
Albums table could be indexed by AlbumTitle to facilitate searches for 
specific albums. The same table could also be indexed by Artist to facili-
tate searches using artist names. 
Database tables should be indexed by any fields that are commonly 
used to organize or locate data. The database designer normally creates 
indexes at the time the database structure is designed. Indexes can also 
be created at a later date, as needed. Figure 10-37 illustrates how an 
index works.

SECTION C, Unit 10
designing the interface
The way that users interact with a database depends on the user interface. 
An operating system provides some conventions for elements of the user 
interface, such as dialog box and button styles, but additional design deci-
sions must be made about how information is presented to users. 
	Doesn’t the DBMS simply generate the user interface? DBMSs 
used by consumers and small businesses generally include tools to create 
database interfaces. Some enterprise-class DBMSs require separate tools 
for this task. Either way, user interfaces are very unique to each application 
and to each business, so it is the responsibility of the database designer to 
map out which fields are displayed, the order in which they appear, and the 
way they are named. Figure 10-38 illustrates the process of designing a 
screen-based form for a database created with Microsoft Access.
Figure 10-38: Designing a form with Microsoft Access 
The design is for a 
form used to enter 
customer data.

associated entry area can be 
arranged and formatted.

	What are the elements of a well-designed database inter-
face? A well-defined user interface for a database should be clear, intuitive, 
and efficient. The following guidelines list strategies for producing well-
designed database interfaces:
• Arrange fields in a logical order beginning at the upper-left corner of the 
screen. The first fields should be those used most often or those that come 
first in the data entry sequence.
• Provide visual clues to the entry areas. A box, a line, or shading can delin-
eate data entry areas. 
• Entry areas should appear in a consistent position relative to their labels. By 
convention, labels are placed to the left of the entry areas or above them.
• Provide a quick way to move through the fields in order. By convention, the 
Tab key performs this function on desktop and laptop computers.
• If all fields do not fit on a single screen, use scrolling or create a second 
screen.
• Provide buttons or other easy-to-use controls for moving from one record to 
another. 
• Stay aware of the platform; controls for a touchscreen device have to be 
large, well spaced, and easy to operate.
• Supply on-screen instructions to help ensure that data is entered correctly. 
Web databases can benefit from links to help pages.
	What are the challenges? Today, a major challenge is to design 
interfaces that are effective on a variety of devices and platforms. As shown 
in Figure 10-39, more than one design might be required for an optimal user 
experience on diverse platforms such as terminals, laptops, and touch-
screen devices. 
Figure 10-39: Different devices require different database interfaces 
Terminals (far left) primarily display text. Desktop and laptop computers (cen-
ter) offer the user interface designer the option of using lots of screen space 
and colorful graphics. Mobile devices (right) have limited screen space and 
require large control buttons.

SECTION c, Unit 10
designing report templates
A report is a printed or screen-based list of some or all of the data in a 
database. Reports can be used to display the results of queries, such 
as when a Vintage Music customer makes a query for all albums by The 
Rolling Stones. Reports can also be used by managers to view transac-
tion details or summaries. They may also be used to list the contents of a 
customer’s shopping cart or order form.
	How are reports created? Most DBMSs include a report generator, 
which is a software tool for specifying the content and format for a database 
report. Reports are based on report templates.
A report template contains the outline or general specifications for a 
report, including such elements as the report title, fields to include, fields to 
subtotal or total, and report format specifications. The template does not, 
however, contain data from the database. Data is merged into the template 
when the report is generated. 
As an example, suppose that a manager at Vintage Music wants to create a 
report that lists albums arranged by price. The manager can create a report 
template called AlbumPriceGroup that specifies the following:
• The title of the report is Vintage Music Albums by Price.
• The report contains data from the Albums table, arranged in four columns, 
with data from the Price, AlbumTitle, Artist, and InStock fields.
• The headings for the columns are Price, Album Title, Artist, and Qty in 
Stock.
• The report is grouped by price.
These specifications would be used to produce a report similar to the one 
shown in Figure 10-40.

print a report on October 12th. This report shown in Figure 10-41, follows the 
same format as the previous report, but includes the new albums.

SQL is the universal language of 
relational databases. It allows customers to search 
for products at ecommerce Web sites. It collects 
new subscriber information for social media sign-
ups. And it can be deployed to collect transaction 
data at ATMs or from point-of-sale systems. SQL 
also presents a potential security vulnerability for 
databases because it is susceptible to code injec-
tion attacks. Section D reveals what you need to

sql basics
The data in a database should change as new records are added, existing 
records are updated, and unneeded records are deleted. These changes 
are based on commands that are sent to the DBMS. The commands are 
issued using computer programming languages designed for databases. 
These languages are sometimes called query languages because one of 
their main capabilities is to request data from a database, such as when a 
customer searches Amazon.com for a specific product. SQL is the world’s 
most popular query language.
	How does a query language like SQL work? Query languages 
like SQL (Structured Query Language) work behind the scenes as an inter-
mediary between the database client software ­provided to users and the 
database itself. 
Database client software provides an easy-to-use interface for entering 
search specifications, new records, data updates, and so on. The client soft-
ware collects your input and then converts it into an SQL query, which can 
operate directly on the database to carry out your instructions, as shown in 
Figure 10-42.
SELECT AlbumTitle FROM Albums 
WHERE Artist = 'Beatles' 
and Format = 'LP'
Form-based user interface
SQL commands interact directly 
with the database to locate 
data, update records, and 
perform other functions 
the user requests.
Client software con-
verts the entries in 
a form into SQL 
commands. 
	Why does SQL pose a security risk? SQL statements contain 
command words and data. These statements are executed by the DBMS. 
For example, in a typical ecommerce database, SQL statements normally 
allow users to search for products, make purchases, and update their own 
accounts. Under some circumstances, however, users can be the source 
of malicious SQL statements that manipulate the database in unauthorized 
ways. Exploits that use malicious SQL statements to gain unauthorized 
access to a database are called SQL injection. To understand what makes 
SQL vulnerable, you need some additional information about the structure 
of SQL queries.

SECTION d, Unit 10
	What does a simple SQL query look like? An SQL query is a 
sequence of words, much like a sentence. For example, an SQL query that 
searches for the song Ruby Tuesday in Vintage Music’s database might 
look like this: 
SELECT TrackTitle FROM Tracks WHERE TrackTitle = 'Ruby Tuesday'
The SQL query language provides a collection of special command words 
called SQL keywords, such as SELECT, FROM, INSERT, and WHERE, 
which issue instructions to the database. Although the SQL examples in this 
section of the unit use uppercase letters for keywords, most implementa-
tions of SQL accept either uppercase or lowercase keywords.
Most SQL queries can be divided into three simple elements that specify an 
action, the name of a database table, and a set of parameters. Let’s look at 
each of these elements.
	How does SQL specify the action that I want carried out in 
the database? An SQL query begins with an action keyword, or com-
mand, which specifies the operation you want carried out. For example, the 
command word CREATE produces a new table in a database. Figure 10-43 
lists some of the most commonly used SQL command words.
Command
Description
Example
CREATE
Create a database  
or table.
CREATE TABLE Albums
DELETE
Remove a record  
from a table.
DELETE FROM Tracks WHERE TrackTitle = 'Blue Suede Shoes'
INSERT
Add a record.
INSERT INTO AlbumDescription (Cat#, Condition) VALUES ('LPM-2256', 
'Mint condition; no visible scratches; original album cover')
JOIN
Use the data from  
two tables.
SELECT FROM Albums JOIN Tracks ON  
Albums.Cat# = Tracks.Cat#
SELECT
Search for records.
SELECT FROM Albums WHERE Artist = 'Beatles'
UPDATE
Change data in a field.
UPDATE Albums SET Price = 15.95 WHERE Cat# = 'LPM-2256'
	How does SQL specify which table to use? SQL keywords such 
as USE, FROM, or INTO can be used to construct a clause specifying the 
table you want to access. The clause consists of a keyword followed by the 
name of the table. For example, the clause FROM Tracks indicates that 
you want to use the Tracks table from Vintage Music’s database.
The command word DELETE removes a record from a table. An SQL query 
that begins with DELETE FROM Tracks means that you want to delete 
something from the Tracks table. To complete the query, you provide param-
eters that specify which record you want to delete.

	How does SQL specify parameters? Parameters are detailed spec-
ifications for a command. Keywords such as WHERE usually begin an SQL 
clause containing the parameters for a command. Suppose that Vintage 
Music’s inventory manager wants to delete all the albums recorded by Bob 
Marley. The parameter for the WHERE clause is Artist = 'Bob Marley'.

CUSTOMER FORM
Now that you’ve learned the basic structure of an SQL query, take a closer 
look at the SQL for specific database tasks, such as adding records, search-
ing for information, updating fields, organizing records, and joining tables. 
adding records
A database record contains information about an entity, such as a customer, 
an online purchase, an ATM withdrawal, or a social media post. The data 
for a new record may be entered by employees, supplied by customers, or 
collected from digital devices. Regardless of the source, the data is bundled 
into an SQL statement that is handled by the DBMS.
	How are records added to a database? Suppose a customer 
wants to purchase an album from Vintage Music’s Web site. As a first-time 
customer, he fills out a form with his name, address, and so on. The client 
software that he uses collects the data entered in the form and generates an 
SQL statement using the INSERT command. The INSERT statement adds 
his data to the Customers table. Figure 10-44 shows the Customer form, the 
SQL statement that adds the customer data to the database, and the data 
that is added to the Customers table.

SECTION d, Unit 10
searching for information
A database can contain millions of records. Imagine, for example, all the 
products in the Amazon.com database or all the subscribers stored by 
Facebook. Sifting through such vast storehouses of data requires the use of 
queries that carry out searches.
	How do SQL queries perform searches? One of the most common 
database operations is to query for a particular record or group of records by 
using the SELECT command. Suppose a customer is looking for Jefferson 
Airplane albums. She fills in the Search box at the Vintage Music Web site, 
as shown in Figure 10-45.
The database client software uses her search specification to create the fol-
lowing SQL query:
SELECT AlbumTitle, AlbumCover FROM Albums WHERE Artist = 
'Jefferson Airplane'
As a result of this query, the Vintage Music Web page displays a list 
beginning with Jefferson Airplane Takes Off—the band’s first album—and 
a photo of the album cover. Take a closer look at the parts of this query 
shown in Figure 10-46.

	Can SQL perform complex searches? Yes. SQL uses Boolean 
operators such as AND, OR, and NOT to form complex queries. You might 
have used these operators to formulate Google searches. To discover how 
Boolean operators work in the context of SQL queries, let’s use the small 
Albums database in Figure 10-47. Just remember that most operational 
databases are far larger, so the data they contain won’t all be visible as in 
this tiny example! 
	How does AND work in an SQL query? AND (sometimes indicated 
by a + sign) is used to retrieve records that meet more than one criterion. 
For example, suppose a customer wants to find all the albums by Jefferson 
Airplane, but she wants to display only albums that are on sale for less than 
$10.00. The customer might enter something like Jefferson Airplane 
<$10.00 in the Vintage Music Web site’s search box. The database client 
creates an SQL query like this:
SELECT AlbumTitle FROM Albums WHERE Artist = 'Jefferson Airplane' 
AND Price < 10.00
You can perform the search manually using the records in Figure 10-47. 
How many records did you find that match the SQL statement? In this exam-
ple, a record is selected only if the Artist field contains Jefferson Airplane 
and the value in the Price field is less than $10.00. If the price is $10.00 or 
more, the record is not selected. The AND operator specifies that both of 
the search criteria must be true for the record to be selected. There are two 
matching records in the database.
	How does OR differ from AND? Two variations of the OR operator 
exist. One variation, the inclusive OR, designates records that meet one 
criterion or both. The other variation, called the exclusive OR, designates 
records that meet one criterion or the other, but not both. 
SQL uses the inclusive OR. A query such as
SELECT AlbumTitle FROM Albums WHERE Artist = 'Jefferson Airplane' 
OR Price < 10.00
produces all the Jefferson Airplane albums, regardless of price. It also pro-
duces any albums that are less than $10.00, regardless of the artist. Look 
back at Figure 10-47. How many records match this search query?

combined to formulate complex queries. For example, Jefferson Airplane 
became Jefferson Starship in 1974. For a list of Jefferson Airplane or 
Jefferson Starship albums that cost less than $10.00, use a query like the 
following:
SELECT AlbumTitle FROM Albums WHERE (Artist = 'Jefferson Airplane' 
OR Artist = 'Jefferson Starship') AND Price < 10.00
Note the use of parentheses around the OR clause. Parentheses tell the 
DBMS to process this part of the query first. How many records does the 
above query find in Figure 10-48?

	Are the parentheses important? The placement of parentheses 
can change the results of a query, sometimes drastically. Compare the pre-
vious query to the following query:
SELECT AlbumTitle FROM Albums WHERE Artist = 'Jefferson Airplane' 
OR (Artist = 'Jefferson Starship' AND Price < 10.00)
The query with parentheses around the AND clause returns all albums 
by Jefferson Airplane, regardless of price, and any albums by Jefferson 
Starship that cost less than $10.00. 
	How does NOT work in an SQL query? The NOT operator can be 
used to omit records from a search by specifying a not-equal relationship. 
For example, the following query returns all records in the Albums table 
where the Artist is not equal to Jefferson Airplane:
SELECT AlbumTitle FROM Albums WHERE NOT (Artist = 'Jefferson 
Airplane')
Sometimes NOT relationships are specified with a not-equal operator, such 
as <> or !=, depending on the specifications of the query language. For 
example, the following query returns the same records as one that uses the 
NOT operator:
SELECT AlbumTitle FROM Albums WHERE Artist <> 'Jefferson Airplane'

updating fields
Database records can be changed only by authorized users. At Vintage 
Music’s ecommerce site, for example, customers do not have authoriza-
tion to change album prices or alter the name of the songs on an album. 
Those activities are reserved for the inventory manager. When a customer 
purchases an album, however, an SQL routine reduces the number in the 
InStock field by one.
	What SQL command changes the contents of a record? Updates 
and modifications to the contents of a database field are made by using the 
SQL UPDATE command. The following command reduces the number of 
G.I. Blues albums by one:
UPDATE Albums SET InStock = InStock - 1 WHERE AlbumTitle =  
'G.I. Blues'
	Is it possible to update a group of records? In addition to changing 
the data in a single record, SQL can perform a global update that changes 
the data in more than one record at a time. 
Suppose you’re Vintage Music’s marketing manager and you want to put all 
Rolling Stones albums on sale by reducing the price to $5.95. You could do it 
the hard way by searching for an Artist field that contains The Rolling Stones, 
adjusting the Price field for that record, and then looking for the next Rolling 
Stones album. However, it would be easier to change all the records with a 
single command using this SQL statement: 
UPDATE Albums SET Price = 5.95 WHERE Artist = 'The Rolling Stones'
Let’s see how this command performs a global update. The UPDATE com-
mand means you want to change the data in some or all of the records. 
Albums is the name of the table containing the data you want to change. 
SET Price = 5.95 tells the DBMS to change the data in the Price field to 
$5.95. WHERE Artist = 'The Rolling Stones' tells the DBMS to change 
only those records where the artist name is The Rolling Stones.
	What are the limitations of the global UPDATE command? 
Although the global UPDATE function is powerful, it works only for records 
that have similar characteristics—for example, all albums by The Rolling 
Stones or all albums produced in 1955. Custom programming is required 
to perform global operations on information that does not have any similar 
characteristics. Figure 10-49 provides an example.
Vintage Music’s marketing manager picks ten albums 
each week to place on a special promotional sale. 
These albums have no common data that can be used 
to formulate a global UPDATE command.
Custom programming allows the marketing manager to 
simply submit a list of ten albums as a document. The 
module “reads” the document and issues an UPDATE 
command for each of the chosen albums.

SECTION D, Unit 10
joining tables
Suppose you want to see a list of songs on Elvis Presley’s G.I. Blues album. 
The songs, however, are not stored in the same table as the rest of the 
album data. SQL is designed for relational databases, so it is adept at 
retrieving data from multiple tables.
	How is data retrieved from more than one table at a time? 
Recall that the process of normalization creates tables that can be related 
by fields that exist in both tables. In SQL terminology, creating a relationship 
between tables is referred to as joining tables. 
The Albums table holds the album title, the artist’s name, the release date, 
and other data about the album. The Tracks table holds the name of each 
song track, the track length, and an MP3 sample of the track. Both tables 
also contain a Cat# field.
Earlier in the unit, you learned that a relationship can exist between Vintage 
Music’s Albums table and Tracks table based on the data in the Cat# field, 
as shown in Figure 10-50.

To take advantage of the relationship between these two tables, you first 
have to join the tables. Why? Remember that in a relational database, the 
tables are essentially independent unless you join them together. The SQL 
JOIN command allows you to temporarily join and simultaneously access 
the data in more than one table.
	How does the JOIN command work? A single SQL query can 
retrieve data for the G.I. Blues album from the Albums table and the Tracks 
table. To do so, however, requires some way to distinguish the data con-
tained in each table. In the example, both tables contain a field called Cat#. 
How can you differentiate the Cat# field that belongs to the Albums table 
from the Cat# field in the Tracks table? 
SQL uses dot notation to make this distinction. Albums.Cat# is the full 
specification for the Cat# field in the Albums table. Tracks.Cat# specifies 
its counterpart in the Tracks table.

When joining two tables, the convention is to use dot notation for field 
names. Figure 10-51 dissects an SQL query that joins two Vintage Music 
database tables.
SELECT Albums.AlbumTitle, 
Albums.AlbumCover, 
Albums.Price,
Tracks.TrackTitle FROM Albums 
JOIN Tracks on Albums.Cat# = Tracks.Cat#
WHERE Albums.Cat# = 'LPM-2256' 
The SELECT clause specifies the fields 
that should be displayed as results. 
Albums.AlbumTitle refers to the 
AlbumTitle field of the Albums table.
The JOIN command links the Albums 
and Tracks tables. The tables are joined 
when the same data appears in the Cat# 
fields of records from the two tables.
The WHERE clause ­specifies that 
you want to see data about the 
album with item number LPM-2256.

 SECTION D
	So how does SQL injection work? A malicious SQL command con-
tains conventional command words, such as SELECT and UPDATE, but 
the parameters for the command contain unusual text that either provides 
the attacker with elevated privileges or overruns a buffer to inject malicious 
code in memory. The following command has the potential to delete an 
entire table from a database:
SELECT AlbumTitle, Artist, Price FROM Albums WHERE name = '\"; 
DROP TABLE Albums; --';
With a slight modification, the malicious SQL statement could copy the 
entire contents of a table to a hacker’s computer. To prevent SQL injection, 
database designers construct DBMS applications with plenty of protective 
measures to screen out potentially harmful SQL statements. Hackers, how-
ever, continue to devise new attack vectors, so consumers do need to take 
precautions to monitor their personal data for identity theft.

Big Data Basics
Astronomers estimate that the universe contains 70 billion trillion stars. The 
digital universe is likely to soon contain as many digital bits as there are stars 
in the physical universe. Such a massive amount of data is almost impos-
sible to visualize, let alone process and analyze. Dealing with a universe of 
data has become one of the top challenges of the Information Age.
	What is big data? The term big data seems oddly non-technical, but it 
has a specific meaning in the world of databases. Big data refers to huge 
collections of data that are difficult to process, analyze, and manage using 
conventional database tools. 
An example of big data is the 1 million transactions generated by Walmart 
sales registers every hour. Other examples of big data include user profiles 
stored on social network sites, the archive of Google searches, medical 
records, astronomical data, and military surveillance data.
Analysts at International Data Corporation describe big data as a core com-
ponent of an emerging computing platform that is likely to drive innovation 
and disruption through the next decade. The 3rd platform is based on cloud 
computing, mobile devices, social networking, and big data. This platform 
has massive scale, not only in cloud-based hardware technology, but also 
in the vast amount of data that will be generated, consumed, and analyzed. 
Figure 10-52 offers hints about the volume of users and data that is pro-
duced by the 3rd platform.

SECTION e, Unit 10
	How big are we talking? The statement that the digital universe 
generates 44 zettabytes of data each year is interesting—but only to those 
people who understand the magnitude of a zettabyte. It is easy to toss 
around terms like petabyte, exabyte, and zettabyte, but they are just words 
with little meaning unless compared to things we deal with every day. A few 
comparisons in Figure 10-53 can help convey the enormous size of these 
numbers. 
1024 Gigabytes = 1 Terabyte
1024 Terabytes = 1 Petabyte 
1 0 2 4  P e t a b y t e s  =  1  E x a b y t e
1024 Exabytes = 1 Zettabyte 
1024 Zettabytes = 1 Yottabyte 
1024 Yottabytes = 1 Brontobyte
1024 Brontobytes = 1 Geopbyte
Figure 10-53: that’s a lot of data! 
Ten terabytes offer enough storage capacity 
to hold the printed collection of the Library of 
Congress. 
According to futurist and inventor Raymond 
Kurzweil, the capacity of a human being’s func-
tional memory is estimated to be 1.25 terabytes. 
Based on this estimate, one petabyte can hold the 
memories of 800 human beings.
If the average MP3 encoding equates to about 1 
megabyte per minute, and the average song lasts 
about four minutes, then a petabyte of songs 
would last over 2,000 years playing continuously.
A single high-res photo is about 3 megabytes in 
size. Suppose you took a petabyte’s worth of 
photos and printed each one on four-inch photo 
paper. The assembled photos placed side by side 
would be more than 48,000 miles long and would 
stretch around Earth’s equator twice.
One petabyte is enough to store the DNA of the 
entire population of the United States and the 
European Union.
62 billion iPhones stacked on top of each other 
would reach from the Earth to the moon. If each 
iPhone has 64 GB of storage capacity, that stack of 
phones would store about 3 zettabytes of data.
Storing a trillion gigabytes would require 
600,000,000,000 smartphones—enough to lay 
end to end over every road in America.
The entire Internet contains about a yottabyte of 
data.

	Why is big data a challenge? Big data is a relatively new phenom-
enon that businesses are just beginning to deal with. According to a Gartner 
study, in 2013 only 16% of companies used analytics. 75% of data ware-
houses will be unable to handle the volume and complexity of near-future 
data demands. And 86% of companies are not able to deliver the right infor-
mation to the right entities at the right time.
The sheer volume of big data is difficult to handle, but additional factors fur-
ther complicate its use. Big data was originally defined as having three Vs: 
volume, velocity, and variety. As big data evolved, however, additional V fac-
tors emerged. Today, big data is characterized as having high volume, high 
velocity, diversified variety, unknown veracity, and low-density value. 
Volume. Big data is high volume. It is measured in petabytes, exabytes, 
and even higher volumes. Storing such high volumes of data can be a chal-
lenge, as is making backups. Big data is typically distributed across many 
storage devices. For example, Facebook operates a cluster of 1,100 servers 
with about 12 petabytes of storage capacity just for its analytical activities. 
Quantcast, a real-time advertising and audience measurement company, 
uses a 300-core cluster of servers to deal with about 1 petabyte of data 
every day. And online music distributor Spotify operates a cluster of 690 
servers with 28 petabytes of storage capacity. 
Velocity. Big data often needs to be handled quickly in order to be use-
ful. As with Internet “speed,” the velocity of big data is actually a measure 
of capacity and may be quantified in terabits per second (Tbps) or even 
petabits per second (Pbps). Although a single Internet connection cannot 
handle such speeds, data may arrive simultaneously over multiple con-
nections. The challenge is to organize the data as it arrives, process it if 
necessary, and store it where it can be easily retrieved.
Variety. Big data commonly consists of multiple data types such as text, 
images, video, numbers, and audio that is generated from transaction pro-
cessing systems, sensors, social media, smartphones, and a diversity of 
other sources. Some data may be structured, while other data is unstruc-
tured. Organizing this mix of data is challenging and may require database 
designers to seek solutions other than the rigid structures of relational data-
bases.
Veracity. Big data can contain an unknown amount of inaccurate data that 
is counter-productive to accurate analytics and decision making. Data veri-
fication can require cross checks, which in turn depend on even more data. 
Value. In the context of big data, value does not necessarily equate to 
money, but rather to the usefulness of data. Big data typically includes a high 
proportion of low-density data that is not relevant to processing or analysis. 
Low-density data refers to large volumes of very detailed data in which 
many of the details are not important. The opposite is high-density data, 
which is packed with lots of useful information.

SECTION e, Unit 10
Big Data Analytics
The 1970s rock band Led Zeppelin was recently accused of stealing a riff 
for its hit song Stairway to Heaven from a lesser known band called Spirit. 
Unlike other cases of wholesale appropriation, such as when The Beach 
Boys based the entire melody for Surfin’ Safari on an earlier Chuck Berry 
song called Sweet Little Sixteen, the Led Zeppelin case involves a short, 
10-second riff. Stairway to Heaven begins with a melodic acoustic guitar 
sequence that is similar to a sequence of notes about 44 seconds into the 
Spirit song. 
Suppose you were defending Led Zeppelin in court and wanted to find a 
similar melodic phrase in an even earlier piece of music. MusicHype CEO 
Kevin King estimates that there are about 97 million recorded songs. That’s 
about 276 terabytes of data—more than 4.8 million hours of music. This is 
clearly big data, and some sort of analytical tool is required to sift through it 
in time for it to be useful. 
	How useful are big data analytics? Searching through all of the 
world’s recorded music may be a very specialized use of big data. There are 
other interesting, but specialized, large datasets that are available for explo-
ration.
Basketball fans can explore NBA player statistics to predict playoff winners 
and point spreads. For teams, there is a service called SportVU that uses 
strategically placed cameras to collect about 1 million data points during 
a typical professional basketball game. Reports from this data, processed 
within 90 seconds of each play, are routed to coaches’ digital devices. Heat 
maps generated from the data can show where most of the action takes 
place on the court, which can then be used to adjust defensive strategies. 
Another offbeat use of big data is searching through Google Books Ngram 
datasets. Google has stored the words from every book it has scanned as 
ngrams, which depict word sequences. Using Google Books Ngram Viewer, 
it is possible to extract word sequences, such as “Royal Wedding,” from a 
vast collection of more than 8 million written works containing more than 
500 billion words. Practical applications of such data mining include finding 
the first use of terms and determining how long after world events occur do 
references to it appear in the literature. 
Mainstream big data exploration produces commercial benefits. A high 
percentage of today’s expenditures on big data are for technologies that 
enhance the customer experience and provide targeted marketing solu-
tions. Real-time analysis and decision making are also popular reasons to 
invest in big data technologies. Figure 10-54 provides an overview of busi-
ness sectors that are making the largest investments in big data.

keting analytics is to maximize profit from every item of merchandise and 
service that is offered by a business. Achieving this vision is a multifaceted 
task. Figure 10-55 presents a step-by-step example showing how a national 
superstore chain might use big data analytics to squeeze out the maximum 
profit from videogame sales in the upcoming holiday season.
STEP 1:
 Collect data from many sources and analyze it using a predictive model. 
This step can take place months before the holiday season.

STEP 2:
 Determine where demand will be greatest, and then plan to stock more 
games in those stores. Data for this step can come from many sources.
STEP 3:
 Use online analytical processing to produce on-the-fly price guidance 
for changing prices as demand grows or inventory shrinks.
STEP 4:
 Find and target customers by sifting through big data from in-house 
databases and external datasets.
STEP 5:
 Customize online and in-store promotions to entice consumers to pur-
chase a videogame and as many additional items as possible.

SECTION e, Unit 10
NoSQL
What is the connection between 1960s rock star Jimi Hendrix, modern pop 
star Alicia Keys, and an amateur American poet named Francis Scott Key 
who was born in 1779? Musicologists would like to easily pull such arcane 
facts out of a massive pool of music trivia. Similarly, corporate executives 
would like to analyze connections and trends from data collected by opera-
tional and analytical databases. Relational databases and SQL might not 
be the best tools for this type of foray into big data, but alternative tools are 
available from NoSQL.
	What is NoSQL? The term NoSQL is used to refer to a group of tech-
nologies for managing databases that do not adhere to the relational model 
and standard SQL query language. SQL is not totally banned from the tech-
nology collection, however, leading some jargon experts to suggest that 
NoSQL actually means “not only SQL.” Other terminology authorities would 
prefer that the term was NoREL, meaning “not relational,” which is a more 
accurate description. NoSQL is a fixed part of the technical vocabulary, 
however, so practitioners generally use it when referring to databases and 
database tools that are not relational.
NoSQL technologies are effective for building and managing non-relational 
databases containing big data that may be unstructured and may be dis-
tributed across multiple servers with dynamically scaling capabilities. When 
visualizing NoSQL, keep in mind the four characteristics in Figure 10-56. 
Distributed. Handles data that is stored across many devices
Dynamically scaling. Easy to add storage devices as the data-
base grows or as the velocity of incoming data accelerates
Flexible data. Handles a variety of data types, as well as data 
that is structured, semi-structured, and unstructured
Non-relational. Uses data models other than the standard 
relational models and SQL
	Why is distributed data a challenge? Picture your own computer, 
and consider if you were working on an astronomy project and you wanted 
to analyze data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The dataset is about 23 
TB, which is too big to fit on your 4 TB hard drive. You could scale up and 
purchase an industrial-size 25 TB drive, or you could scale out and distrib-
ute the data among several smaller drives.
A scale up (or scale vertically) solution adds resources to a single device. 
The advantage of scaling up is that the dataset remains as one unit. You 
can use standard relational database tools to perform queries, joins, and 
updates. Businesses use this scale-up strategy as their databases grow in 
size. They purchase ever larger storage devices and newer, faster comput-
ers to process database queries. Eventually, however, a single machine 
reaches a performance ceiling where additional users and their queries 
become entangled in processor bottlenecks. Regaining performance 
requires a solution other than scaling up.

A scale out (or scale horizontally) solution adds more devices to a system, 
typically by adding nodes on a LAN or in an Internet cloud. To scale out to 
accommodate the 23 TB Sloan Digital Sky Survey, you could distribute the 
data to other devices on your home network or cloud storage devices. 
Distributing a database requires that it be divided into smaller units, much 
like breaking up a block of ice. The process of dividing a database into 
distributed subsets is called sharding, and each subset of data is called a 
shard. Distributing a database brings up the obvious problem about how 
to divide it and then how to send a query across all of the devices that hold 
the data. 
You can probably see how this scenario relates to businesses, Web sites, 
and social media platforms with big data collections. Information systems 
that work with big data can scale up to a point, but then they are forced to 
scale out and require a new set of tools for managing the database. Those 
tools are provided by NoSQL technologies.
	What is significant about dynamic scaling? Many years ago 
when ecommerce was an emerging technology, Victoria’s Secret devised 
a sure-fire marketing plan that revolved around a live runway show video-
cast over the Internet. Interest in the event was so high that within the first 
minute of the show, the number of users trying to connect overwhelmed the 
Victoria’s Secret server. 
Today, Victoria’s Secret could use a dynamic cloud solution to add capac-
ity on demand and then release the extra capacity when it is no longer 
needed. Dynamic scaling (or autoscaling) ensures acceptable database 
throughput by scaling out as necessary to handle peak loads. Dynamic 
scaling is desirable in situations such as when a newly launched Web site 
goes viral and generates a high volume of user traffic or when an ecom-
merce business expects seasonal peaks during holidays.
Dynamic scaling can be applied to database servers and to communica-
tions servers. Communications servers handle the number of users that 
are able to connect, whereas database servers handle the number of data 
records that are stored and available for access. Dynamic scaling for data-
base servers can be a challenge because the additional sharding has to 
be handled on the fly by the DBMS. Once again, NoSQL tools have advan-
tages over SQL for such adaptations (Figure 10-57).

SECTION e, Unit 10
	Why is unstructured data such a challenge? Relational databases 
store structured data, and that data has two important characteristics. First, 
the data easily breaks down into discrete fields that fit into a table format 
of rows and columns. Second, the data for multiple entities can be stored 
within a defined structure, such as a customer record type or an inventory 
item record type. Much of the data of interest to organizations is structured, 
but a growing amount of data is semi-structured or unstructured as shown in 
Figure 10-58.
Data source: Enterprise Strategy Group
Unstructured and semi-structured data—such as tweets, email messages, 
blog posts, Facebook posts, images, and videos—are difficult to mold into 
fixed structures. The effort to do so can be costly and time intensive. The 
results can be unsatisfactory because as the data is transformed, much of 
the context may be lost. Tweets, for example, have a rich underpinning of 
associated data, such as the tweeter’s number of followers. That data, if 
needed, could be placed in a table that is separate from the table that holds 
the body of the tweet. Pursuing the relationships between followers, tweets, 
hashtags, and @mentions, however, quickly produces a set of relationships 
that resembles a plate of spaghetti and becomes unmanageable. 
Relational databases are organized according to a schema, which is simply 
the blueprint for its structure. The rows, columns, and tables of a relational 
database are part of its schema. The schema is defined when the database 
is designed and remains essentially fixed for the duration of its life cycle.
NoSQL tools create what are often characterized as schema-less data-
bases, allowing data structures such as fields to be added, modified, or 
distributed while the database is operational. 
The concept of schema-less databases is something of an exaggeration. 
Schema changes are possible to some extent with relational databases, 
and NoSQL databases actually have structures. Schema-less is a term 
used to convey the idea of less formal and more flexible structures. Four 
commonly used NoSQL data models are key value, column oriented, docu-
ment oriented, and graph.

	What is the structure for the key-value database model? The 
simplest structure for storing data in a NoSQL database is the key-value 
data model. Envision a big fish bowl filled with items. Each item is stamped 
with a unique ID, so you can pull out a specified item at any time. 
In a key-value database, each data item has a key that is a unique 
identifier similar to a relational database key such as CustomerID or 
LicensePlateNumber. The value associated with each key can be any chunk 
of data, such as a tweet, an image, a video, an email message, a PDF, a 
hypertext link, or a sound recording. Figure 10-59 illustrates the key-value 
schema.
	What is the structure for the column-oriented database 
model? Suppose you are interested in finding all the tweets that include 
#pressplay. If tweets were somehow stored in a relational database, each 
one would begin with an ID that linked it to a user, and there would be a 
date field, a time field, and perhaps a field indicating retweets. Why read 
through all the irrelevant relational fields when a column-oriented database 
could help you reach the data faster? 
The column-oriented data model stores data in columns, rather than in 
rows, so it works well in situations where the focus is on analysis of chunks 
of data, rather than delving into individual records. Figure 10-60 illustrates 
the column-oriented schema, which makes it easy to search through all the 
data in a column, such as TWEETS.

SECTION E, Unit 10
	How about the document model? Document-oriented databases 
were illustrated earlier in the unit by a document marked up with XML tags to 
allow efficient searches within the text content. Documents are sometimes 
classified as unstructured data, but they can also be regarded as complexly 
structured data because different documents can exhibit extreme variations 
in their length and the sequence of elements they contain. For example, 
a Huffington Post article might feature the author’s name at the top of the 
page, whereas an Association for Computing Machinery article displays the 
author’s name and a short biography at the end.
The intriguing aspect of document-oriented databases is that the specific 
schema for each document is not planned when the database is built, nor is 
it maintained by the DBMS. Instead, each document essentially carries its 
own schema in the form of its markup. 
With each document carrying its own schema, the placement of the 
<author> tag is unimportant. And if there is no author tag, that is fine, too. It 
is even acceptable for some future document to show up with a <coauthor> 
tag, illustrating the flexibility of this approach for content with high variability.
	How does the graph model work? Graph databases were intro-
duced earlier as a flexible alternative to hierarchical database models. 
These databases are organized around nodes that have attributes and rela-
tionships that connect nodes. Graph database schemas are a useful and 
efficient way to store data that will be retrieved or organized based on rela-
tionships. They can also be used for social media applications to keep track 
of a subscriber’s friends, friends of friends, and activities.
Suppose you are researching the history of popular music, and you are 
interested in tracing links between musicians and songs. For example, you’d 
like to be able to trace the musicians and bands that influenced Jimi Hendrix 
or discover how many modern artists have performed The Star-Spangled 
Banner. You’d like to be able to pull any item from the database and unravel 
all its connections.
Consider, how you might set up a relational database to reveal all these 
musical relationships. It is difficult unless you use a graph database. Figure 
10-61 illustrates a small segment of a graph database where musicians, 
songs, and bands are nodes and their relationships are tracked by edges.

	What are popular NoSQL tools? NoSQL tools include MongoDB, 
Cassandra, HBase, Neo4j, SimpleDB, Hive, Google BigTable, and 
Voldemort, but the two most popular are Hadoop and MapReduce.
Hadoop is a file system developed in 2005 that handles millions of files 
distributed across multiple server nodes. Hadoop has been deployed by 
many of the world’s biggest Web sites. It stores search queries that pour 
into Yahoo and manages product databases at eBay and many other ecom-
merce sites. Last.fm uses Hadoop for royalty reporting and audio track 
analysis. LinkedIn uses Hadoop for its People You May Know feature.
Hadoop storage is complemented by a second NoSQL technology called 
MapReduce that efficiently accesses the dataset. The methodology used 
by MapReduce is very different from the SQL approach. Whereas SQL 
pulls data from records in storage and delivers them to the application for 
processing, MapReduce sends the processing logic to the data and only 
returns the result. Figure 10-62 illustrates the difference between rela-
tional and NoSQL databases and shows the efficiency advantages of using 
NoSQL for distributed big data.

Issue: Can Data Mining Catch Terrorists?
Smoke Rises over the skyline. It 
could be New York, Oslo, Moscow, Paris, Mumbai, or 
any major city. The cause: a terrorist attack. As the 
survivors mourn the dead, they inevitably ask: Could 
this attack have been prevented?
Modern data analysis techniques are successfully 
deployed in the private sector to detect consumer 
fraud, assess home loan applications, and predict 
consumer buying patterns. If direct marketers can 
easily aggregate and ana-
lyze data from Web sites that 
you visit and public informa-
tion in your Facebook profile, 
wouldn’t it be just as easy to 
mine existing databases to 
uncover patterns in terrorist 
behavior, identify individuals 
who fit the pattern, and prevent 
them from carrying out terrorist 
activities?
Governments maintain vast 
databases. Surely a proper 
search of this data, combined 
with public sector data, such 
as Web site access, credit card use, travel history, 
email messages, and telephone records, could pro-
duce a manageable list of potential terrorists.
This theory was put to the test when the founder of a 
data mining company trolled through a collection of 
data looking for people likely to commit acts of ter-
ror. His algorithm produced 1,200 names; five of them 
were hijackers in the 2001 September 11th attacks.
What seems like a remarkable feat of predictive anal-
ysis, however, reveals several problems with data 
mining methodology. The analysis identified 1,200 
potential terrorists, but only five of these individu-
als actually participated in a terrorist operation. The 
remaining 1,195 people did not carry out attacks. 
Nineteen terrorists were involved in the attacks; data 
mining did not identify even a third of them.
Further, this data mining analysis was carried out 
after September 11th, using hindsight information 
available about the attackers. Predicting who will 
carry out future attacks is more difficult because the 
targets and modus operandi are unknown.
An algorithmic search for patterns in a collection 
of databases is an example of automated terrorist 
identification. Some degree of privacy is maintained 
because a machine, rather than a human analyst, 
searches the data. 
To sort through machine-generated results and 
weed out false positives, however, a human analyst 
eventually has to view the data and all the personal 
details it includes. According to privacy advocates, 
this analysis subjects thousands 
of innocent civilians to intense 
scrutiny and potential loss of civil 
liberties.
Privacy advocates also fear 
that government data mining is 
susceptible to mission creep, a 
term that refers to projects that 
expand beyond their intended 
scope. 
Data collected for homeland 
security might be used to identify 
other types of offenders, such 
as tax evaders, digital music 
pirates, or parents who are late 
on child support payments. Catching such individuals 
might be a worthy social goal, but it requires a consid-
erable amount of government scrutiny of the lives of 
ordinary people.
Data mining could also be used to profile ethnic 
groups or harass individuals who contribute to orga-
nizations that oppose the policies of the dominant 
political party.
According to civil liberties advocates, government 
data mining is more dangerous than private sector 
analytics because the repercussions can be extreme. 
Government investigations can trigger IRS harass-
ment, airport pat downs, and wiretaps, rather than a 
few irritating ads that pop up based on your profile in 
an online marketing aggregator’s data warehouse.
Governments have a responsibility for the safety of 
their citizens, but what is the right balance between 
civil liberties and security? The answer to this ques-
tion requires citizens to understand the potential as 
well as the limits of data mining technology.

 ISSUE
TRY IT! Data mining is controversial, but it is an evolving technology that might have the potential to 
increase civilian security. Explore data mining firsthand to understand the issues.
	 As yet, there is not a fail-proof method for automatic terrorist identification. Suppose that a researcher 
devises an algorithm that is correct 99% of the time. For every 100 names it produces, one will be a false 
positive—someone who is not a terrorist. It will also miss one person who is a terrorist. If this algorithm is 
used to analyze the 308,745,538 people in the U.S., how many innocent people would be falsely identi-
fied as terrorists, and how many real terrorists would go undiscovered?
	 People leave personal digital tracks whenever they make a purchase, take a trip, access their bank 
account, make a phone call, file an income tax return, stroll past a security camera, obtain a prescription, 
mail a package, apply for a loan, email a friend, rent a video, or download music. Create a fictitious per-
son and provide five examples of online activities he or she might perform that would look suspicious to a 
data mining algorithm but are actually perfectly innocent activities.
	 After a flurry of post-Snowden concerns about National Security Agency (NSA) data collection and data 
mining, NSA Director Keith Alexander testified before Congress that the government’s secret surveillance 
program has stopped “dozens” of terrorist acts. Can you discover if the U.S. government provided factual 
evidence to support this claim?
	 To find out how extensively your government is using data mining, you can go directly to the source. For 
example, in the U.S., the Department of Homeland Security Privacy Office issues an annual Data Mining 
Report to Congress. Read the most recent report. List and briefly describe the data mining projects 
that are operational. Also, google Signals Intelligence Presidential Policy Directive. Summarize what that 
document says about data collection and data mining.
 
Technology is increasing the amount and type of data that is available to data mining operations. Although 
data mining originally was designed to analyze text data, advances in facial recognition and translation 
provide multimedia input for data mining algorithms. You can test facial recognition systems at online 
sites that find celebrities with facial features similar to yours. Upload a photo (it doesn’t have to be yours) 
at a celebrity look-alike site such as FaceDouble. Based on the accuracy of finding similar faces, how 
efficient would this system be for identifying a terrorist based on his or her photo?
	 NameTag is a controversial project to design an app that allows you to photograph strangers with your 
mobile phone in order to discover their names and social media profiles. What can you discover about 
this app and what is the controversy that surrounds it?

Information Tools: Vetting Anonymous
Tweets, forum postings, and comments attached to online articles can be 
a gold mine of information. When you have a problem with a digital device, 
an online forum might offer advice on a quick “fix.” When you want break-
ing eyewitness news as events unfold, there’s no source like Twitter. And if 
you’re interested in the other side of a story, look no further than the com-
ments at the end of an online blog post or article.
The information from these sources is often difficult to verify. Many partici-
pants use pseudonyms, effectively making them anonymous. Let’s take a 
look at the pros and cons of using these sources.
You 
should be par-
ticularly careful about 
information on which 
you base personal activi-
ties such as treating illness, 
dieting, filing taxes, and 
troubleshooting digital 
or automotive 
equipment.
Forums
Forums allow participants to 
post questions to which other 
participants provide answers. 
Forums are popular sources 
for information when you are 
troubleshooting problems with 
digital devices, software, or 
automobiles. They also offer 
opportunities to discuss health, 
investments, diets, and a variety 
of other topics.
On technology topics, third-party 
forums sometimes address 
issues that are not acknowl-
edged by online forums operated 
by equipment manufacturers and 
vendors.
When using information from 
forums to troubleshoot soft-
ware, hardware, and connection 
problems, beware of mislead-
ing statements that could make 
problems worse. 
Before you follow a complex set 
of instructions to tackle a tech-
nical problem, make sure the 
source is reliable and the solu-
tion seems technically plausible. 
Read comments and follow the 
discussion threads pertaining to 
suggested solutions; they can 
help you determine if the solution 
might work.
Twitter
Twitter is like a river of infor-
mation, continually flowing and 
ever changing. It is a premium 
source for information about 
what’s happening right now.
Twitter posts broke the news 
of the Continental Airlines 
crash that became known as 
the Miracle on the Hudson, the 
Boston Marathon bombing, and 
Osama bin Laden’s death. 
But not everything on Twitter is 
legitimate. A group called Script 
Kiddies has managed to hack 
into several legitimate Twitter 
accounts and post false tweets: 
an attack on Ground Zero just 
before the tenth anniversary 
of 9/11 and a false report that 
President Obama had been 
assassinated in 2010.
These tweets originating from 
NBC News and FOX News 
appeared legitimate, but they 
weren’t—a reminder that even 
information with provenance 
that seems genuine may not be 
true.
Tweets often provide links to 
blog posts or Web sites contain-
ing more detailed information on 
an issue or a topic. You can use 
standard techniques to check 
the provenance of those sites.
Comments
Provocative articles spawn 
commentary. That commen-
tary is sometimes useful to 
readers and researchers 
because it reveals the scope 
of an issue and provides 
glimpses of its many facets.
Most sites that accept com-
ments require participants to 
register and provide a valid 
email address. However, that 
requirement does not prevent 
people from using screen 
names and throwaway email 
accounts.
Commenters may have valid 
reasons for cloaking their 
identities, and their com-
ments might be informative. 
Unless you can verify and 
cross-check the informa-
tion, however, you should not 
accept it as authoritative.
Anonymous comments or 
comments from sources that 
can’t be properly verified 
should not be used as the 
basis for factual citations, but 
they can give you ideas and 
viewpoints that help expand 
your research to encompass 
the full scope of a topic.

TRY IT! So what should you do with information that comes from an 
anonymous source or one cloaked in the secrecy of a screen name? Here’s 
a chance to work with a few verification techniques.
	 Although forums are sometimes billed as “advice and recommen-
dations from a community of experts,” participants are not always 
experts, and the advice offered is not always accurate. The first step 
to identifying the source of information is to click any links available 
to the user’s profile. Select an article from a technology news source, 
such as Engadget or HuffPost Tech, that includes lots of comments. 
Click the picture and name links for three commenters, and then fill in 
the following table, entering NA if the information is not available.
Commenter 1
Commenter 2
Commenter 3
Commenter “Handle” 
Commenter Real Name
Number of Posts
General Quality of Posts
	 Verifying tweets requires a twofold approach: gathering information on 
the tweeter, and triangulating the location and timing of the content. To 
see how it works, check out a technology Twitter feed. You can access 
tweets even without a Twitter account by googling twitter search and 
then using the Search box at the top of the screen. Enter Cisco to find 
information about the technology company that specializes in network 
equipment. Select a tweet that appears to come from an individual, 
and then answer the following questions: 
a.	 Does the tweeter provide a name, picture, and biography?
b.	 If you search for the tweeter’s name in Google, do you find further 
clues to the person’s identity?
c.	 What is the person’s track record of blog posts, forum responses, 
or tweets?
d.	 Does the source have a large following on Twitter or an extensive 
network of friends on Facebook, LinkedIn, or Google+?
e.	 Can you determine where the source is located and if the location 
might be relevant to verifying the information (as in an eyewitness 
account)?
f.	 Are other sources reporting similar information?
g.	 If the information is a link or retweet, can you identify the original 
source?
h.	 Does the language of the message sound appropriate for the 
source? 
	 When you’re looking for a solution to a technical problem and you 
come across forum postings such as “I don’t know” or “I’ve never tried 
this but...,” you probably wonder why anyone would waste his or her 
time (and yours) with information that is totally useless. Connect to 
Reddit and search for keyboard not responding. Read at least ten 
posts on this topic. Select what you think are the best and the worst 
posts, and then briefly explain your selections.

Obama vs. Romney. In the 2012 U.S. 
presidential race, Democratic candidate Barack 
Obama’s bid for a second term as president was 
challenged by former Massachusetts governor Mitt 
Romney. Both candidates knew that the Internet and 
social media would be essential tools for victory, but 
the two campaigns deployed very different digital 
strategies. One was successful; the other was not.
The Obama campaign used a collection of technolo-
gies designed to make it easy for organizers and 
grassroots volunteers to get engaged with fund-rais-
ing and get-out-the-vote activities. At the core of this 
technology collection was a distributed information 
system code-named Project Narwhal. 
Obama’s chief technology officer, Harper Reed, 
directed Narwhal’s development—a project that 
began 17 months before the 2012 election.
Narwhal and its satellite tools were written using 
the Python programming language and hosted on a 
2,000-node cluster within Amazon’s cloud computing 
services, which allowed dynamic scaling as data-
bases grew in size and the data traffic flowing to and 
from the servers increased. The system handled a 
respectable 4 Gbps, with capacity for 600,000 queries 
per minute. During its deployment, the system accu-
mulated 180 terabytes of data and handled about 8.5 
billion queries.
Narwhal was designed to handle big data. It gob-
bled up publicly available voting records from past 
elections. Data from the 2008 campaign supplied 
information on 170 million potential voters, 13 million 
online supporters, 3 million donors, and 3 million vol-
unteers. For the 2012 campaign, it was Narwhal’s task 
to comb through this data looking for the most likely 
voters, donors, and volunteers. Additional analytical 
software, such as Dreamcatcher, allowed the sys-
tem to microtarget voters based on beliefs expressed 
when talking to staffers.
Based on analytics, both fund-raising and voting 
messages could be targeted to specific groups. For 
example, the campaign conducted an email fund-
raising campaign based on Obama’s plan to require 
insurance plans to fully cover the cost of contracep-
tion. Such a proposal would not appeal to all Obama 
supporters, so the message was sent only to young, 
single, liberal women or those voters who expressed 
support for subsidized contraception to online or 
phone-based campaign workers. 
As the campaign progressed, one of Twitter’s former 
employees built a tool for sending direct messages to 
targeted groups of users. Another social tool, called 
Dashboard, let anyone log in to the Obama campaign 
site and choose a task, such as calling ten undecided 
voters or organizing an Obama supporter meet-up.
Email blasts from the Obama campaign were meticu-
lously tested on small groups before being scaled 
up to mass mailings. Analytics helped determine 
which blasts were most effective. The best email 
blasts would return upwards of $3 million in dona-
tions whereas a less effective mailing might net only 
$500,000. By testing for quality, donations rolled in at 
unprecedented rates.
Those donations provided the campaign with funds to 
purchase television and online ads. Developers cre-
ated a tool called the Optimizer that used data from 
Rentrack, a company that tracked viewership for 
every quarter-hour of the day based on factors such 
as age, race, gender, and income level. Ads were 
aired during times when viewership was highest for 
voters within the Obama demographic.
The Obama team also used psychological analytics 
and Facebook connections to orchestrate a unique 
get-out-the-vote initiative. Based on research findings 
that people are more likely to vote if their friends on 
social media vote, an opt-in Facebook outreach pro-
gram was used to encourage Obama supporters to tell 
specific friends—especially those in swing states—to 
vote. “Hey, your friend Mary Jones in Florida hasn’t 
voted yet. Send her an email and urge her to take 
advantage of early voting.”
Data gathered by Narwhal made the Obama cam-
paign the most efficient and effective in U.S. history. 
Canvassers did not waste time knocking on the doors 
of voters who were committed Obama supporters. 
And once a supporter had donated the maximum 
$2,500 allowed by federal law, fund-raising emails 
were discontinued in favor of emails suggesting ways 
to volunteer.
Despite the big data distributed across many cloud 
servers, the collection of custom-designed tools, and 
the unprecedented use of social media, Narwhal ana-
lytics were based on four simple numbers designed to 
determine who the campaign should target and what 
each of those potential voters needed to hear.

Using a scale from 1 to 100, each voter was scored 
based on the likelihood that he or she would sup-
port Obama along with the probability of that voter 
actually casting a ballot. A third score was designed 
to assess whether an individual with a spotty vot-
ing record might be motivated by canvassers or 
email campaigns to vote. The fourth score estimated 
whether an undecided voter might be persuaded to 
cast a ballot for Obama if motivated by 
a specific issue, such as comprehen-
sive immigration reform. 
Whereas the 2012 Obama campaign 
used a collection of technologies and 
big data analytics for a long-term strate-
gic operation, the Romney campaign’s 
ORCA technology was designed pri-
marily as an Election Day tool for 
gauging voter turnout and determin-
ing precincts where campaign workers 
needed to make last-ditch Election Day 
efforts to get the Republican base to 
the polls.
ORCA was a Web-based application that could be 
used on a smartphone, tablet, or laptop computer at 
each polling place by Romney campaign volunteers. 
The app connected to a database of registered vot-
ers from specific polling locations. As each person 
voted, his or her participation was recorded and 
relayed to the ORCA database. There, analysts com-
pared expected Republican voter turnout to actual 
numbers and in theory could mobilize campaign vol-
unteers to pull in no-shows.
ORCA consisted of 11 database servers, one front-
end database application server, and one Web 
server. It was developed within a short six-month 
window, which allowed little time for testing. When 
the system went live on Election Day, it was essen-
tially in a beta-test phase and not at all ready for 
operational use. 
Armed with ORCA devices, 37,000 volunteers sta-
tioned themselves at polling places throughout the 
country on Election Day. At 9:30 am, the ORCA serv-
ers went down. Neither the Web server, the front-end 
database server, nor the communications links were 
sufficient to support the amount of incoming data. 
At one point, ORCA’s Internet service provider shut 
down the network connection because the traffic 
resembled a denial-of-service attack.
A political commentator writing in Wired magazine 
suggested that Romney might have won the elec-
tion if each of his 37,000 campaign volunteers had, 
instead of using ORCA, brought just 20 voters to the 
polls in swing states. By all accounts, ORCA was an 
unmitigated disaster that may have cost Republicans 
a victory.
Political campaigns take place on a fast-paced 
and intensive battlefield. Today, digital warriors are 
increasingly called into action. This is just one of 
many career opportunities for data scientists who 
specialize in big data analytics. 
The challenging job of a data scientist is to identify 
and join multiple data sources and then mine them 
for actionable information based on trends and pat-
terns. In addition to predictive analytics used in 
political campaigns, data scientists also tackle rec-
ommendations based on business analytics and 
social network activity.
Data science combines computer science, statisti-
cal analysis, and communication skills. The Python 
programming language is a popular tool for applying 
statistical procedures to large datasets, and familiar-
ity with Hadoop, MapReduce, SQL, Hive, and Excel 
are essential. 
Professors Pfister and Blitzstein base a course at 
Harvard University on the five-step data science 
process, which involves asking an interesting ques-
tion, getting the data, exploring the data, modeling 
the data, and communicating the results in written, 
numeric, or visual formats. With coursework and 
experience in the realm of data science, you could 
find yourself helping the next president-elect to 
achieve victory.
Instructions for using the ORCA app
Search the below list between 
people who have ‘Not voted’ 
and ‘All Voters’ then click 
‘Search Voters.’
Use age for observation 
to visually confirm

Critical Thinking
A key component of the databases used by politi-
cal campaigns for voter analytics is data about past 
voting. That data includes voter names, addresses, 
and voting history. The data does not include who 
you voted for, but in some states the data includes 
your race and whether you are a registered 
Democrat or Republican. Most states and several 
commercial Web sites provide this data for use in 
local, state, or national political campaigns. Did you 
know that your voting record is public information? 
What are the advantages and disadvantages of 
making that information public? 
Group Project
Form a group of four to five students. Suppose you 
must design the record structure for a new infor-
mation system that holds driver’s license data. 
Using your own driver’s licenses, design an effec-
tive record structure, indicating record types, field 
names, field lengths, and data types. Where appro-
priate, indicate ways that you could minimize data 
entry errors. Submit your record structure to your 
instructor. 
Cyberclassroom
How do student demographics compare through-
out the world? The Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development has gathered sta-
tistics in an interactive databases at www.oecd.
org/edu/database.htm. Working alone or in a small 
group, link to any of the datasets that look interest-
ing. Notice that you can create custom queries by 
selecting variables in the control panel above the 
data tables. After exploring the data, formulate 
three specific queries for extracting information. For 
example, you might be interested in which country 
has the highest number of non-resident male stu-
dents or the number of students who graduated 
with a degree in computing from the U.S. in the 
past ten years. If you are working in a small group, 
challenge the other students to predict what they 
think the data might produce. Can you surprise 
them with facts that run counter to commonly held 
assumptions about students around the world?
Multimedia Project
Today, Web-based videos are a viable way of learn-
ing about products and picking up technical skills. 
Locate an instructional video about a DBMS such 
as FileMaker, Oracle, or SAP. After viewing the 
video, write five short paragraphs describing five 
concepts or skills you learned. As an alternative to 
a written summary, your instructor could change 
up the assignment by asking you to mark five key 
concepts in the video and then present them to a 
partner in class.
Resume Builder
When you look for a job, you might have to send 
query letters and resumes to several employers. To 
track the status of each, you can use a database. 
Use word processing, spreadsheet, or database 
software to create a job-hunting database that 
includes company contact information plus fields 
to indicate the status of your inquiry. Load the 
database with at least five sample contacts. Make 
sure you can use the database to generate mail-
ing labels. You should also be able to make queries 
to determine which job prospects are still “active” 
possibilities. Follow your instructor’s guidelines for 
submitting your database and mailing labels.
Globalization
Computer databases often store personal informa-
tion about the citizens of more than one country, 
yet privacy expectations and laws differ. For this 
project, explore the differences in privacy laws 
around the globe. Which countries have the stron-
gest privacy laws and which have the weakest? 
Which laws would govern the data stored by mul-
tinational companies? As a global consumer, which 
databases would concern you the most for poten-
tial privacy violations? Consolidate your thoughts 
into a one- to two-page paper and submit it to your 
instructor.

Interactive Summary
7 4 2 	
Unit 10
SECTION A: A(n) 
 is a col-
lection of information, generally stored as computer files. 
The information it contains can be stored, updated, orga-
nized, output, distributed, searched, and analyzed. A filing 
cabinet full of folders and papers would be classified as a(n)
 file. A(n) 
 file 
uses a uniform format to store data for each person or thing 
in the file. One of the simplest models for storing data is a(n) 
 file that consists of a single, two-
dimensional table of data elements. Each row in the table is 
a(n) 
 , and each column of the 
table is a(n) 
 . Each kind of record 
is referred to as a record 
 . A 
record that contains data is sometimes referred to as a record 
 . In databases, records can be 
related by one-to- 
 relationships, 
one-to-many relationships, or many-to-many relationships. 
The number of associations that can exist between two 
record types is referred to as 
  . 
Relationships can be depicted graphically by using 
 - r e l a t i o n s h i p  d i a g r a m s . 
 databases allow only one-to-many 
relationships. 
 databases connect 
nodes much like a sociogram. 
 
databases exist as a series of tables that can be related by 
common fields. A(n) 
 database 
organizes relationships over three or more dimensions. A(n) 
 database stores data in objects 
that can be grouped into classes and defined by attributes and 
methods. Document-related databases store text in JSON for-
mat or marked up with 
 .
SECTION B: Modern database tools ­support data 
 , which means separating data 
from the programs that manipulate data. As a result, a single 
data management tool can be used to maintain many different 
files and databases. Many 
 appli-
cations, from consumer apps to enterprise-level ERP systems, 
have a database at their core. 
 
files can be created and manipulated by using a variety of 
tools, including word processing and spreadsheet software. 
For databases composed of more than one record type, how-
ever, it is best to use a database management system, which 
is abbreviated as 
 . Most of these 
systems support 
 databases with 
data stored in tables, but database tool vendors also offer 
products for other database models. Database tools handle 
the way data is physically stored, including the process of 
 data across multiple servers. 
Database tools also support multiple users and use a tech-
nique called 
 to handle situations in 
which more than one user attempts to update the same record. 
A database and the DBMS used to create it are installed on 
a specific in-house computing platform, such as Linux, or are 
hosted as a(n) 
 service. The data 
can be accessed by devices using other platforms through the 
use of database 
 software.

DATABASES 	
7 4 3
SECTION C: The first step in designing a relational 
database is to define its fields by specifying a field name and a 
data type. Integer, date, and 
 data 
types are used for fields containing data that might be math-
ematically manipulated. The 
 
data type is used for fixed-length fields containing text that 
is not intended to be mathematically manipulated. The 
 data type is a variable-length 
field for entering text. The 
 
data type is used to store true/false and yes/no data. The 
 data type can be used to store 
URLs. The 
 data type is used to 
store binary data, such as MP3 files and graphics. When 
designing fields, a database designer can also include field 
formats, field 
 rules, and lookup 
routines to reduce data entry errors. The number of tables 
in a database can be determined by a process called 
 , which helps a database designer 
group fields into record types and avoid data redundancy. A 
database designer must also ­consider how to sort or index 
records. The 
 key for a table 
specifies the order in which records are stored and indicates 
where new records are inserted in a table. Indexing provides 
an alternative way to organize records, using a series of keys 
and pointers to temporarily arrange data without affecting the 
physical sequence of records specified by the sort order.
SECTION D: SQL is a database 
 
language that generally works behind the scenes as an inter-
mediary between the database 
 soft-
ware provided to users and the database itself. Although the 
specifications for searches and other database tasks are col-
lected by easy-to-use graphical user interfaces, those speci-
fications are ­converted into SQL 
  , 
which can communicate directly with the database. An 
SQL query contains SQL 
 , such 
as SELECT, FROM, INSERT, JOIN, and WHERE, plus 
 that specify the details of the com-
mand. Records can be removed from a database using the 
SQL 
 command. Records can be added 
to a table using the SQL 
 command. To 
search for data, you can use the SQL 
 
command. Changing or replacing the data in a field requires 
the SQL 
 command. SQL also pro-
vides a(n) 
 command that can be 
used to ­temporarily consolidate two tables so that data can 
be accessed simultaneously from both of them.
SECTION E: Big data refers to huge collections of 
data that are difficult to process, analyze, and manage 
using conventional data tools. It is a core component of the 
 platform, which also includes cloud 
computing, 
 devices, and social net-
working. The five Vs of big data are high volume, high 
 , diversified variety, unknown verac-
ity, and low- 
 value. Although SQL and 
relational databases can be used for big datasets, a collec-
tion of alternative tools referred to as 
 
has become popular. These tools work well when databases 
scale 
 (horizontally) and when data-
bases are broken into subsets called 
 . 
Modern database tools also handle 
 
scaling as devices are added when additional capac-
ity is required. NoSQL tools are sometimes said to create 
 databases, but they usually have 
some type of structure, though it may be more flex-
ible than the relational model. A key- 
 
data model provides each data element with a key. A(n) 
 -oriented data model makes it easy 
to access data stored in similar fields, rather than in indi-
vidual records. Two very popular NoSQL tools include 
 , which is a big data file system, and 
 , which sends processing logic to the 
data, rather than bringing the data to the computer that per-
forms the processing.

orders, you know this is a(n) 
 
-to-many relationship.
3.	
You are designing a record type that holds customer 
information. You should use a(n) 
 
data type for the fields that hold information such 
as telephone numbers and Social Security numbers 
because although this data looks like numbers, 
you’ll never need to use it to perform mathematical 
calculations. 
4.	
You are creating a movie review database, and one field 
stores the “star rating” that a popular reviewer gave each 
movie. Movies are rated from one to four stars, so the 
Stars field is valid only if the number is between 1 and 4. 
To ensure that nobody enters a value below 1 or above 4, 
you can use a field 
 rule to filter the 
data as it’s entered into the table.
5.	
You want to print a professionally designed list of all the 
records in your database. To organize and format the list, 
you use a report generator to create a reusable report 
 .
6.	
You own a fly-fishing shop and maintain an inventory 
database that, along with inventory data, stores the 
names of the wholesalers from which you buy each item. 
Hot Rod Wholesalers just changed its name to Northern 
Rod and Reel, so you need to update your database. The 
best way to accomplish this task would be to perform a(n) 
 update that changes every instance 
of “Hot Rod Wholesalers” to “Northern Rod and Reel.”
7.	
You are designing the database structure for a mail-
order catalog company. You recognize that a many-to-
many relationship exists between an order and the items 
listed on the order. This clue indicates that you should 
separate the data into two 
 : 
one called Orders and the other called Order Details. 
8.	
You’ve retrieved some documents from a database, and 
you notice that they contain tags such as <editor>Ella 
Ellison</editor> and <born>1960/05/26</born>. You 
surmise that this is a document-oriented database 
in which each document has been marked up using 
 .
9.	
Imagine that you just started working for a political 
campaign. The campaign manager obtained a database 
with 190 million voter records, which are now stored on 
one of the campaign’s laptops. The campaign manager 
has heard all about big data. Should he use NoSQL or 
SQL to pull records for local voters out from the dataset?

LAB: SQL
GOOGLE MAKES IT TOO EASY. Although Google queries search an amazing amount of data, Google’s free-form 
query capability does not convey what it is like to query a relational database with a tool such as SQL. To get a more 
accurate idea about how business, ecommerce, and political databases work behind the scenes, you can experiment 
with SQL queries using a sample database.
REQUIREMENTS: 
For this lab, you’ll need a computer with Internet access. Please use Google Chrome or Safari as your browser. The 
instructions are generalized; they provide helpful guidelines but not specific steps. 
ASSIGNMENT:
 Connect to the W3Schools SQL Tryit Editor. 
Open a browser, connect to www.w3schools.com/sql/, 
and then click the button labeled “Try it yourself.” 
Click the Restore Database button, and then click OK 
when the small dialog box appears. 
You should now see a list of database tables, such as 
Customers, Categories, and Employees, as shown 
below:
Tablename	 	
Records
Customers	
91
Categories	
8
Employees	
10
OrderDetails	
518
Orders	
196
Products	
77
Shippers	
3
Suppliers	
29
 Record the structure for the Customers, Orders, 
OrderDetails, and Products tables. 
To do so, open a blank word processing document and 
name it [Your Name] Unit 11 Lab. 
Begin by selecting the Customers table. Highlight the 
field names at the top of the table as shown at right. Copy 
the fields (use Ctrl-C for PCs, Command-C for Macs). 
Paste the field names into your word processor (use 
Ctrl-V for PCs, Command-V for Macs). Do the same with 
the Orders, OrderDetails, and Products tables.
 List all the customers in Germany.
To display the Customers table, click the Customers link.
The window at the top of the screen shows the SQL for 
displaying all the customers: 
SELECT * FROM [Customers].
Modify this SQL statement so that it reads:
SELECT * FROM [Customers] where Country = 
'Germany'
Click the Run SQL button to see the results. If you receive 
an error message, check your spelling and punctuation, 
and then run the query again.
 Use SQL to find and record in your lab document 
how many records match each of the following queries:
How many customers are in London?
How many orders did customer 69 place?
What is the PRICE of Tofu? (Hint: Replace the * with 
Price in the SQL query.)
How many UNITS of Pavlova are in stock?

 Unit 10
 Let SQL do the counting.
Suppose you want to know how many orders contained line items with quantities of 20 or more. Enter the following 
SQL:
Select * FROM [OrderDetails] WHERE Quantity >=20
Scrolling down, you see there are many matches to this query. SQL can count these records for you when you enter 
the following:
SELECT count(quantity) FROM [OrderDetails] where Quantity >=20
Using this basic type of query, find out how many products were ordered in quantities fewer than 5.
Copy your query and paste it into your lab document.
 Join two tables.
You may have noticed that when you counted the products that were ordered in large and small quantities, you only 
had access to the product numbers. The OrderDetails table does not contain any product names. 
To see the names of products that have been ordered, you have to join the OrderDetails table and the Products table.
Remember the dot notation? OrderDetails.ProductID and Products.ProductID are the fields that will create the join.
Enter this SQL query all on one line:
SELECT ProductName, Quantity FROM Products JOIN OrderDetails on  
OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID WHERE Quantity<5
Can you modify the SQL so that the results also display the price of each item?
Copy all the records shown as results and paste them into your lab document.
 Try another join.
Take a look at the Orders table. It contains five fields: OrderID, CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderDate, and ShipperID. 
You can see when the order was placed, but the table does not contain the name of the customer. 
Can you create a join that displays the OrderID, CustomerID, CustomerName, and OrderDate?
(Hint: You have to SELECT the four fields listed in the previous paragraph, and you have to join the Orders and 
Customers tables based on CustomerID.)
Copy your SQL query and the first five records shown as results, and then paste them into your lab document.

 Use the INSERT command to add your name to the Customers table.
This is a long one, so enter it carefully! (Hint: It is all on one line.)
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, CustomerName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)  
VALUES ('100', 'Your Name', 'Your Address', 'Your City', 'Your ZIP Code', 'Your Country')
To discover if your name was inserted, select the Customers table and scroll to the end. Your name should be the last 
record in the table. (Note: Your name will not remain in the database after you exit the Web page.)
Copy the record containing your name plus the three records above it, and then paste them into your lab document.

Programming Basics
Smartphone apps. Productivity software. Games. All the goodies on digi-
tal devices are powered by computer programs. What is programming all 
about? Section A introduces you to the programmer’s world.
	What’s the scope of computer programming? Computer 
programming encompasses a broad set of activities that include planning, 
coding, testing, and documenting. Most computer ­programmers participate 
to some extent in all of these phases of program development, but they 
focus on writing instructions that computers follow to perform tasks. 
A related activity, software engineering, is a development process that 
uses mathematical, engineering, and management techniques to reduce 
the cost and complexity of a computer program while increasing its reliabil-
ity and modifiability. Software engineering can be characterized as more 
formalized and rigorous than computer programming. It is used on large 
software projects where cost overruns and software errors might have 
disastrous consequences.
Some software engineering activities overlap with the systems analysis 
and design activities presented in Unit 9. To distinguish between the two, 
remember that systems analysis and design encompasses all aspects of an 
information system, including ­hardware, software, people, and procedures. 
In contrast, software engineering tends to focus on software development.
	What is program code? As you learned in earlier units, a computer 
program is a set of step-by-step instructions that tell a computer how to 
carry out a task. The instructions that make up a computer program are 
sometimes referred to as code, probably because program instructions for 
first-generation computers were entered as binary codes. 
Today, program code contains familiar English-like words. Figure 11-1 illus-
trates the code for a short program that converts inches into centimeters.
The program makes calculations 
using inches and centimeters. 
These values are initially set to 0.
Figure 11-1: A program written using the Python programming language
Hashtags indicate comments that 
are used for documentation. 
The program begins by display-
ing a title. 
The program asks the user to 
enter a length, which is stored in 
a variable called inches. 
The calculation is performed and 
stored in a variable called centi-
meters. 
The program displays the length 
in centimeters and then ends.

SECTION A, Unit 11
	How big is a typical computer program? Compared to commer-
cial application software, the programs that you’ll work with in this unit are 
relatively tiny. The program for your computer’s operating system consists 
of more than 50 million lines of code. Even “small” iPhone apps can exceed 
40,000 lines of code. Research has shown that, on average, one person 
can write, test, and document only 20 lines of code per day. It is not sur-
prising, then, that most commercial programs are written by programming 
teams and take many months or years to complete.
	Are there different classifications of programs? Computer pro-
grams can be classified in many ways, but programmers typically specialize 
in either application programming or system development. 
Application programmers create productivity applications such as 
Microsoft Office, as well as enterprise applications such as CRM and ERP. 
They also create apps for mobile phones and develop Web applications 
that run in the cloud.
Systems programmers specialize in developing system software such as 
operating systems, device drivers, security modules, and communications 
software. Some systems programmers work on a team to create new sys-
tem software. Other systems programmers may be responsible for ensuring 
that mainframes and servers perform at peak efficiency by adjusting various 
operating system and communications settings and writing small custom 
utilities to monitor performance.
	How much time does it take to develop an iPhone or Android 
app? A 2013 study of 100 app developers by Kinvey, Inc., revealed that 
the average expected development time for an iPhone or Android app is 
about 18 weeks. Apps vary in complexity from simple MVP apps to more 
full-featured apps that interact with enterprise systems. 
As you might expect, complex apps tend to take longer to develop than 
simple iPhone apps. They are also more expensive; the cost of developing 
a mobile game can exceed $250,000. Figure 11-2 breaks down develop-
ment times based on complexity.

Program planning
Suppose a group of market analysts—or even a group of hungry students—
wants to determine which pizza restaurants offer the best deals. You and a 
small group of friends decide to create a free app that helps users find the 
best deal from local pizzerias. Eventually, your team hopes to monetize the 
app by selling ads to restaurant owners. Initially, however, you plan to create 
a simple, MVP app that can run on iPhones.
	How does a programmer plan a computer program? Problems 
you might try to solve using a computer often begin as questions—for exam-
ple, “Which pizza place has the best deal?” But such questions might not 
be stated in a way that helps devise a method for a computer to arrive at an 
answer. 
A question such as “Which pizza place has the best deal?” is vague. It does 
not specify what information is available or how to determine the best deal. 
What do you know about the pizzas? Prices? Toppings? Sizes? What does 
“best deal” mean? Is it the cheapest pizza? Is it the pizza that gives you the 
most toppings for the dollar? Is it the biggest pizza you can get for the $24.63 
that you and your friends managed to scrape together? 
The process of planning a computer program begins with a problem state-
ment that clearly defines the program’s purpose.
	What is a problem statement? In the context of programming, a 
problem statement defines certain elements that must be manipulated to 
achieve a result or goal. A good problem statement for a computer program 
has three characteristics:
• It specifies any assumptions that define the scope of the problem.
• It clearly specifies the known information.
• It specifies when the problem has been solved. 
Study Figure 11-3 and see if you can formulate a problem statement that 
is better than the initial vague question “Which pizza place has the best 
deal?”

SECTION A, Unit 11
	What is an assumption? In a problem statement, an assumption 
is something you accept as true in order to proceed with program plan-
ning. Assumptions can be used to define the scope of a problem so that it 
does not become too complex. Programmers sometimes start with a set of 
assumptions that simplify a problem. After a simplified version of the prob-
lem is solved, subsequent versions can tackle more complex aspects of the 
problem. For example, with the pizza problem, you can limit its complexity 
by making the assumptions listed in Figure 11-4.
The program will compare two pizzas at a time. A later version of 
the program might allow users to compare any number of pizzas. 
Some pizzas are round and others are square, but none of the 
pizzas are rectangular. This assumption simplifies the problem 
because you need to deal only with the size of a pizza, rather than 
the length and width of a pizza. Eventually, you can modify this 
aspect of the program to deal with rectangular pizzas.
The pizzas have the same toppings, so the program will not have to 
deal with comparing one pizza with five meat toppings to a mush-
room and cheese pizza with only two toppings.
The pizza with the lowest cost per square inch is the best buy.
	How does known information apply to a problem statement? 
The known information in a problem statement is the information that is 
supplied to the ­computer to help it solve a problem. For the pizza problem, 
the known information includes the prices, shapes, and sizes of pizzas from 
two pizzerias. 
The known information is often included in the problem statement as giv-
ens. For example, a problem statement might include the phrase, “given the 
prices, shapes, and sizes of two pizzas....” 
	How can a problem statement specify when a problem is 
solved? After ­identifying the known information, a programmer must 
specify how to determine when the problem has been solved. Usually this 
step means specifying the output that is expected. Of course, you cannot 
specify the actual solution in the problem statement. You won’t know, for 
example, whether VanGo’s Pizzeria or The Venice has the best deal before 
you run the program, but you can specify that the computer should output 
which pizza is the best deal. 
Suppose we assume that the best deal is the pizza with the lowest price per 
square inch. For example, a pizza that costs 5¢ per square inch is a bet-
ter deal than a pizza that costs 7¢ per square inch. The problem is solved, 
therefore, when the computer has calculated the price per square inch for 
both pizzas, compared the prices, and printed a message indicating which 
one has the lower price per square inch. 
You could write this part of the problem statement as “The computer will 
calculate each pizza’s price per square inch, compare the prices, and then 
print a message indicating which pizza has the lower price per square inch.”

statements would be considered 
an assumption for the pizza 
program?

square.

	What’s the problem statement for the pizza program? You can 
incorporate your assumptions, known information, and expected output into 
a problem statement, such as the following:
Assuming that there are two pizzas to compare, that both pizzas 
­contain the same toppings, and that the pizzas could be round or 
square, and given the prices, shapes, and sizes of the two pizzas, the 
computer will print a message indicating which pizza has the lower price 
per square inch. 
	Does the problem statement provide sufficient planning to 
begin coding? Formulating a problem statement provides a minimal 
amount of planning, which is ­sufficient for only the simplest programs. A typ-
ical commercial application or a non-MVP app requires far more extensive 
planning, which includes detailed program outlines, job assignments, and 
schedules. Several software development methodologies exist to help pro-
gram designers and coders plan, execute, and test software. Methodologies 
can be classified as predictive or agile. 
Predictive methodology. A predictive methodology requires extensive 
planning and documentation up front. It is the type of methodology used 
to construct buildings and assemble cars—tasks that are well defined and 
predictable. Predictive methodologies work well for software development 
projects that are well defined and can be patterned after other similar proj-
ects. 
Predictive methodologies tend to be used for large software development 
projects involving more than ten developers, geographically dispersed 
development teams, and life-critical applications. Creating the software for 
air traffic control or a point-of-sale system might be successfully approached 
by using predictive methodology.
Agile methodology. Many software development projects are unique, 
however, and are not well defined. In contrast to predictive methodologies, 
an agile methodology focuses on flexible development and specifications 
that evolve as a project progresses. Agile methods seem best for projects 
with a small core of developers working at a single location.
In an agile-driven project, for example, programmers might produce a sub-
set of the entire project, show it to users, and then plan the next phase 
of development based on the feedback received. Unlike predictive meth-
odologies, agile development expects and welcomes feature creep, which 
pushes developers to produce a final product that better meets user needs.
Within the agile development framework, the process of developing each 
iteration of a program is called a sprint. Each sprint produces a fully func-
tional and tested program. Subsequent sprints produce enhanced versions 
based on user feedback that may modify features or even expand the proj-
ect’s scope. 
The pizza project is a small app being built by a small team, so it lends itself 
well to agile methodology. The first sprint as defined by the problem state-
ment is to build an MVP app that asks for pizza prices, sizes, and shapes, 
and then calculates which pizza has the lowest price per square inch.

SECTION A, Unit 11
program coding 
The cool thing about computer programming is that the instructions you 
supply to the computer are followed with precision and without question 
or complaint. Your program is a small universe over which you have com-
plete control. You begin with a clean slate that is ready and waiting for your 
instructions. 
	How do I code a computer program? The core of a computer 
program is a sequence of instructions. Just as an English sentence is con-
structed from various words and punctuation marks that follow a set of 
grammar rules, each instruction for a computer program consists of key-
words and parameters that are held together by a set of rules. 
For example, suppose you would like the pizza program to conclude with a 
message such as “Pizza at VanGo's Pizzeria is the best deal!” The instruc-
tion to display that message looks like this when written in the Python 
programming language:
print ("Pizza at ", restaurant, " is the best deal!")
	What keywords do I need to know? A keyword, or command, is 
a word with a predefined meaning. Keywords differ depending on the pro-
gramming language. As with human languages, however, there is a basic 
vocabulary that covers most necessary tasks. Figure 11-5 lists some key-
words used in the Python programming language.

	What comes after the keyword in an instruction? Keywords 
can be combined with specific parameters, which provide more detailed 
instructions for the computer to carry out. These parameters include vari-
ables and constants.
	How do programmers use variables? Factors, such as price, 
shape, and size, are often treated as variables in computer programs. A 
variable represents a value that can change. For example, the price of a 
pizza can vary or change depending on the pizza shop from which it is pur-
chased, so pizzaPrice could become a variable in the pizza program. 
In contrast, a constant is a factor that remains the same throughout a pro-
gram. For example, the mathematical constant pi always has a value of 
3.142. 
Computer programmers think of variables and constants as named memory 
locations, which are equivalent to empty boxes where data can be tempo-
rarily stored while being manipulated by a computer program (Figure 11-6). 
	What is the significance of syntax? Programming requires atten-
tion to details, such as the sequence of keywords and the placement of 
punctuation. Whereas humans can usually understand statements that 
are somewhat vague, computer languages are not flexible—every period, 
colon, semicolon, and space have to be accounted for. 
The set of rules that specify the sequence of keywords, parameters, and 
punctuation in a program instruction is referred to as syntax. Syntax is simi-
lar to the grammar of human languages. Figure 11-7 illustrates some syntax 
rules for Python.

SECTION A, Unit 11
	What can I use to actually write a program? You may be able to 
use a text editor, program editor, or graphical user interface to code com-
puter programs. Your choice depends on your programming language and 
the distribution platform. Tools for developing Android apps differ from those 
used to develop apps for the iPhone. Yet another set of programming tools 
might be required for desktop and laptop computers. You’ll explore program-
ming languages and tools in more depth later in this unit, but take a look 
at the three basic coding options: text editors, program editors, and visual 
development environments. 
	What is a text editor? A text editor is any word processor that can be 
used for basic text editing tasks, such as writing email, creating documents, 
and coding computer programs. Notepad, the accessory program supplied 
with Microsoft Windows, is one of the most popular text editors used for pro-
gramming PCs. Text editors such as Pico and TextEdit are popular on Macs. 
When using a text editor to code a computer program, you simply type in 
each instruction. The lines of code are stored in a file, which can be opened 
and modified using the usual editing keys. 
	What is a program editor? A program editor is a type of text editor 
specially designed for entering code for computer programs. These editors 
are available from several commercial, shareware, and freeware sources. 
Features vary but can include helpful programming aids, such as keyword 
colorizing, word completion, keyboard macros, and search/replace. Figure 
11-8 illustrates the difference between a text editor and a program editor.
In a program editor, text 
colors help programmers 
easily recognize commands, 
comments, and variables.
Program editors also keep 
track of variable names, 
objects, and methods, so 
programmers can easily 
locate them.
A text editor such as Notepad 
(top) allows programmers to 
enter lines of code using a famil-
iar word processing interface.
Figure 11-8: Text editors and program editors
Terminology
Programmers can use a 
text editor, but not a word 
processor, to write program 
code. ASCII files produced 
with a text editor contain no 
embedded codes for centering, 
bold, and other formatting 
attributes, which are not 
allowed in program code.

text editor, such as Notepad or 
TextEdit. Do you have software 
that could be used to code a

	What is a VDE? A VDE (visual development environment) provides pro-
grammers with tools to build substantial sections of a program by pointing 
and clicking rather than typing lines of code. VDEs for mobile devices are 
based on a storyboard that a programmer manipulates to design the user 
interface for an app. 
Using tools provided by the VDE, a programmer can add objects, such as 
controls and graphics, to the storyboard. In the context of a VDE, a control 
is a screen-based object whose behavior can be defined by a ­programmer. 
Frequently used controls include labels, menus, toolbars, list boxes, text 
boxes, option buttons, check boxes, and graphical boxes. 
A control can be customized by specifying values for a set of built-in 
properties. For example, a button control can be customized for the 
pizza program by selecting values for ­properties such as shape, color, 
font, and title (Figure 11-9).

SECTION A, Unit 11
program testing and documentation
A computer program must be tested to ensure that it works correctly. Testing 
often consists of running the program and entering test data to see whether 
the code produces the correct results. If testing does not produce the 
expected results, the program contains an error, sometimes called a bug. 
This error must be corrected, and then the program can be tested again and 
again until it runs error free.
	What can cause program errors? Programs that don’t work cor-
rectly might crash, run forever, or provide inaccurate results. When a 
program doesn’t work correctly, it is usually the result of a runtime, logic, or 
syntax error.
Runtime errors. A runtime error occurs when a program runs. Some 
runtime errors result from instructions that the ­computer can’t execute. The 
instruction discountPrice = regularPrice/0 produces a runtime 
error because dividing by 0 is a mathematically impossible operation that 
the computer cannot perform.
Logic errors. A logic error is a type of runtime error in the logic or design 
of a program, such as using the wrong formula to calculate the area of a 
round pizza. Logic errors can be caused by an inadequate definition of the 
problem or an incorrect formula for a calculation, and they are usually more 
difficult to identify than syntax errors.
Syntax errors. A syntax error occurs when an instruction does not follow 
the syntax rules, or grammar, of the programming ­language. For example, 
the instruction print "A " price "pizza is cheap." produces a 
syntax error because it is missing some punctuation. The correct version 
of the instruction is print ("A ", price, " pizza is cheap."). 
Syntax errors are easy to make, but they are usually also easy to detect and 
correct. Figure 11-10 lists some common syntax errors.
	How do programmers find errors? The process of finding and fix-
ing errors in a computer program is called debugging. Programmers can 
locate errors in a program by reading through lines of code, much like a 
proofreader. They can also use a tool called a debugger to step through a 
program and monitor the status of variables, input, and output. A debugger 
is sometimes packaged with a programming language or can be obtained as 
an add-on.
• Omitting a keyword, such as ELSE
• Misspelling a keyword, such as 
mistakenly typing PIRNT instead of 
PRINT
• Omitting required punctuation, such 
as a period, comma, or bracket
• Using incorrect punctuation, such as 
typing a colon where a semicolon is 
required
• Forgetting to close parentheses

	Do computer programs contain any special documentation? 
Anyone who uses computers is familiar with program documentation in the 
form of user manuals and help files. Programmers also insert documenta-
tion called remarks (or comments) into the program code. Remarks are 
identified by language-specific symbols, such as # in Python, or keywords, 
such as REM in BASIC. 
Remarks are useful for programmers who want to understand how a pro-
gram works before modifying it. For example, ­suppose you are assigned to 
make some modifications to a 50,000-line program that calculates income 
tax. Your task would be simplified if the original programmer included 
remarks that identify the purpose of each section of the program and explain 
the basis for any formulas used to perform tax calculations.
A well-documented program contains initial remarks that explain its purpose 
and additional remarks in any sections of a program where the purpose of 
the code is not immediately clear. For example, in the pizza program, the 
purpose of the expression 3.142 * (radius * radius) might not be 
immediately obvious. Therefore, it would be helpful to have a remark pre-
ceding the expression, as shown in Figure 11-11.
# For a round pizza, calculate area using pi (3.142)
# multiplied by size1 / 2 **2, which is the radius 
# squared.
if shape1 == "round":
    squareInches1 = 3.142 * (size1 / 2) **2
squareInchPrice1 = price1 / squareInches1
	When is a program ready for release? Creating a program that 
runs without error is not the final goal of the software development process. 
Programs should also meet performance, usability, and security standards. 
Performance. Users don’t like to wait for a program to load. They don’t 
like to pause while a program accesses Web-based resources. The atten-
tion span of users is about two seconds, which means that software has 
to respond to commands and input within that time span. Bottlenecks on a 
local device, on computer networks, or in the cloud can reduce response 
times to unacceptable levels, especially within enterprise information sys-
tems. To make sure performance is acceptable, programmers may need to 
carry out real-world tests or use simulation utilities that model thousands of 
virtual users, multiple devices, and variable network conditions.
Usability. Programs should be easy to learn and use. The process of 
learning how to use a program can be simplified if buttons and input areas 
are clearly labeled and similar to well-known standards. Using colors and 
graphics to make the program visually attractive can also improve usability 
and marketability. Usability is also enhanced when a program is efficient; 
users should be able to perform tasks in as few steps as possible.
Security. Software security begins when program specifications are formu-
lated. Techniques such as formal methods, threat modeling, and defensive 
programming help programmers remain aware of security throughout the 
software development life cycle.

SECTION A, Unit 11
	What are formal methods? Formal methods help programmers 
apply rigorous logical and mathematical models to software design, cod-
ing, testing, and verification. According to security experts, most software 
security problems can be traced back to defects that programmers uninten-
tionally introduce in software during design and development. The general 
nature of the defects that create security holes is widely known. One way to 
avoid these defects is to use formal methods. 
Organizations that use formal methods tend to produce more secure soft-
ware. Formal methods, however, add to the cost and time of software 
development, so they tend to be used primarily for life-critical systems, such 
as air traffic control and nuclear reactor control systems, where security and 
safety are crucial.
	What is threat modeling? Threat modeling (also called risk analy-
sis) is a technique that can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities by 
listing the key assets of an application, categorizing the threats to each 
asset, ranking the threats, and developing threat mitigation strategies that 
can be implemented during coding. Threats can be categorized using a 
model such as STRIDE, as described in Figure 11-12. 
Spoofing: Pretending to be someone else 
Tampering: Changing, adding, or deleting data 
Repudiation: Covering tracks to make attacks difficult to trace
Information disclosure: Gaining unauthorized access to information 
Denial of service: Making a system unavailable to legitimate users
Elevation of privilege: Modifying user rights to gain access to data
Some threats are more likely to occur than others, and some threats have 
the potential to cause more damage than others. As part of the threat 
modeling process, software designers can rank threats using the DREAD 
categories in Figure 11-13.
Damage: How much damage can a particular attack cause? 
Reproduce: Is this attack easy to reproduce? 
Exploit: How much skill is needed to launch the attack? 
Affected: How many users would be affected by an attack? 
Discovered: How likely is it that this attack would be discovered?

	What is defensive programming? Defensive programming (also 
referred to as secure programming) is an approach to software development 
in which programmers anticipate what might go wrong as their programs run 
and take steps to smoothly handle those situations. It is analogous to defen-
sive driving, which requires drivers to anticipate dangerous situations arising 
from adverse conditions or the mistakes of other drivers.
Defensive programmers anticipate ways in which their programs could be 
compromised by legitimate users, intruders, other applications, the operat-
ing system, or third-party software. Techniques associated with defensive 
programming include: 
• Source code walkthroughs. Open source software goes through exten-
sive public scrutiny that can identify security holes, but proprietary software 
can also benefit from a walkthrough with other in-house programmers.
• Simplification. Complex code is more difficult to debug than simpler 
code. Simplifying complex sections of code can sometimes reduce a pro-
gram’s vulnerability to attacks.
• Filtering input. It is dangerous to assume that users will enter valid input. 
Attackers have become experts at concocting input that causes buffer over-
flows and runs rogue HTML scripts. Programmers should use a tight set of 
filters on all input fields.
	Bottom line: Is programming really difficult? Programming is 
an activity that requires attention to detail and logical thinking. But it also 
requires a good dose of creativity and thinking outside of the box. 
As you have discovered in this section, a handful of concepts for planning 
programs, coding instructions, testing programs, and securing them from 
threats apply to the programming process regardless of the programming 
language or the device on which the program will run. Whether creating a 
simple mobile app or tying together modules for a complex information sys-
tem, these are the underlying concepts of the programmer’s world.

Language Evolution
Programming languages may seem detailed and complex. Program code 
often appears to be a messy jumble of brackets, parentheses, and semi-
colons interspersed with unintelligible formulas and commands such as 
System.out.println. The languages programmers use today evolved through 
several generations of increasing sophistication. Taking time to understand 
this evolution will help clear up some basic programming concepts that may 
otherwise seem mysterious.
	How are some programming languages more sophisticated 
than others? Sophistication is not a technical term. Computer scientists 
instead use the term abstraction, which in a broad sense removes detail 
and theoretically reduces complexity. When applied to programming lan-
guages, abstraction inserts a buffer between programmers and the 
chip-level details of instruction sets and binary data representation. 
As an analogy, think about driving a car with a manual transmission that 
requires you to shift gears using a clutch and a stick shift. Compare that to 
a car with an automatic transmission that does not require the driver to deal 
with shifting gears. The car with an automatic transmission has a higher 
level of abstraction because the driver does not need to be concerned with 
the mechanics and gears of the car’s hardware. 
For programming languages, abstraction automates hardware-level 
details, such as how to move data from memory to the processor or how 
to determine which button a user selects on a touchscreen. Programming 
languages evolved from low-level languages to languages with increasingly 
higher levels of abstraction (Figure 11-14).  
	What is a low-level language? A low-level language has a low 
level of abstraction because it includes commands specific to a particu-
lar CPU or microprocessor family. Low-level languages include machine 
languages and assembly languages. Programmers rarely use low-level 
languages today. The code is excruciatingly detailed and symbolic, which 
makes it difficult to write, debug, and maintain.

Programmers using low-level 
languages have to deal with 
hardware-level tasks, such as 
loading data into registers of the 
processor with the following code: 
MOV REG1
MOV REG2
ADD REG1, REG2
Programmers using high-level 
languages are buffered from the 
hardware details by levels of 
abstraction. Only one instruction is 
needed, and the programmer does 
not have to specify the registers 
where the numbers are located.

SECTION b, Unit 11
	What is a high-level language? A high-level language uses com-
mand words and grammar based on human languages to provide a level 
of abstraction that hides the underlying low-level assembly or machine lan-
guage. High-level languages are used to develop applications, games, and 
most other software.
High-level languages, such as BASIC, Python, Java, Prolog, and C++, 
make the programming process easier by replacing unintelligible strings of 
1s and 0s or cryptic assembly commands with understandable commands, 
such as PRINT and WRITE. Using a high-level language simplifies the cod-
ing process and produces programs that are easier to debug and maintain 
than programs written in low-level languages.
	How did programming evolve from low-level to high-level 
languages? The first computers were programmed without programming 
languages. Technicians rewired a computer’s circuitry to prepare it for vari-
ous processing tasks. Programming languages were very primitive at first, 
but they evolved through many generations into the computer languages of 
today.
	What was the first generation of programming languages? 
Initially, programmers used machine languages for programming comput-
ers, and these languages are sometimes referred to as ­first-generation 
languages. In Unit 2, you learned that a machine language consists of a set 
of commands, represented as a series of 1s and 0s, corresponding to the 
instruction set that is hard-wired into the circuitry of a microprocessor. 
Machine language programming is prone to errors. A zero out of place can 
cause a fatal error that is difficult to debug. Programmers quickly realized 
that alternative programming tools were essential, which led to the develop-
ment of second-generation languages. 
	What is a second-generation language? Second-generation 
languages added a level of abstraction to machine languages by 
substituting abbreviated command words for the strings of 1s and 0s used 
in machine languages. Languages in this new generation were called 
assembly languages. 
Like a machine language, an assembly language is classified as a low-
level language because it is machine specific—each assembly language 
command corresponds on a one-to-one basis to a machine language 
instruction. 
An assembly language instruction has two parts: the op code and the oper-
ands. An op code, which is short for operation code, is a command word for 
an operation such as add, compare, or jump. The operand for an instruction 
specifies the data, or the address of the data, for the operation. As you look 
at the parts of an assembly language instruction in Figure 11-15, consider 
how tedious it would be to write a program consisting of thousands of these 
concise, but cryptic, op codes.

	Can a processor directly execute assembly language 
instructions? Microprocessors only understand machine language, so 
there has to be some way to convert assembly language instructions into 
1s and 0s. That task is performed by a utility program called an assembler. 
An assembler typically reads a program written in an assembly language, 
translates the program into machine language, and then submits the 
machine language program to the processor for execution. 
Programs written in assembly languages cannot run until they are trans-
lated. This extra step is the cost of abstraction. But as computer capacity 
and speed increased, this cost became less and less significant. In a 
moment you’ll discover how assemblers paved the way for compilers and 
interpreters that emerged with third-generation programming languages. 
	What is a third-generation language? When high-level 
languages were originally conceived in the 1950s, they were dubbed third-
generation languages because they seemed to be a major improvement 
over machine and assembly languages. Third-generation languages used 
easy-to-remember command words, such as PRINT and INPUT, to take the 
place of several lines of assembly language op codes or lengthy strings of 
machine language 0s and 1s. 
Third-generation languages, such as COBOL and Fortran, were used exten-
sively for business and scientific applications. Pascal and BASIC were 
popular teaching languages. C and C++ remain popular today for system 
and application software development—for example, to develop Microsoft 
Windows and Linux. Recently developed third-generation languages are 
important for modern apps. Objective-C and Swift are programming lan-
guages used to develop iPhone and iPad apps. Java is used for Android 
apps.
An important characteristic of third-generation programming languages is 
that the source code can be written with simple tools, such as a text editor, 
and this code can be easily understood by programmers. Read through the 
program in Figure 11-16. Can you guess what it does?

SECTION b, Unit 11
	What is a fourth-generation language? Many computer scien-
tists believed that third-generation languages would eliminate programming 
errors. Programmers using third-generation languages still made a variety of 
errors, however, so computer language development continued to progress. 
In 1969, computer scientists began to ­develop high-level languages, called 
fourth-generation languages, which more closely resembled human lan-
guages than did third-generation languages. Fourth-generation languages, 
such as SQL and RPG, eliminate many of the strict punctuation and gram-
mar rules that complicate third-generation languages. 
Today, fourth-generation languages are primarily used for database applica-
tions. A ­single SQL command, such as SORT TABLE Kids on Lastname, 
can replace many lines of third-generation code, as shown in Figure 11-17. 
	What about fifth-generation languages? In 1982, a group 
of Japanese researchers began work on a fifth-generation computer 
project that used Prolog—a computer programming language based 
on a declarative programming paradigm, which is described in detail 
in Section E. Prolog and other declarative languages became closely 
identified with the fifth-generation project and were classified as fifth-
generation languages. 
Some experts disagree with this classification, however, and instead 
define fifth-generation languages as those that allow programmers to 
use graphical or visual tools to construct programs rather than typing 
lines of code. 
SORT TABLE Kids on Lastname
PUBLIC SUB Sort(Kids As Variant, inLow As Long, inHi As Long) 
    DIM pivot   As Variant 
    DIM tmpSwap As Variant 
    DIM tmpLow  As Long 
    DIM tmpHi   As Long 
    tmpLow = inLow 
    tmpHi = inHi 
     pivot = Kids((inLow + inHi) \ 2)
    WHILE (tmpLow <= tmpHi)
       WHILE (Kids(tmpLow) < pivot And tmpLow < inHi)
          tmpLow = tmpLow + 1
       WEND
       WHILE (pivot < Kids(tmpHi) And tmpHi > inLow)
          tmpHi = tmpHi - 1
       WEND
     IF (tmpLow <= tmpHi) THEN
          tmpSwap = Kids(tmpLow)
          Kids(tmpLow) = Kids(tmpHi)
          Kids(tmpHi) = tmpSwap
          tmpLow = tmpLow + 1
          tmpHi = tmpHi - 1
       END IF
    WEND
    IF (inLow < tmpHi) THEN Sort Kids, inLow, tmpHi
    IF (tmpLow < inHi) THEN Sort Kids, tmpLow, inHi

Compilers and Interpreters
Have you ever tried to look at the contents of a software application? If you 
peer inside a file such as Excel.exe, all you’d see is a bunch of numbers and 
symbols. What happened to the human-readable code that the programmer 
created using a high-level programming language? Most likely, the program-
mer’s source code got compiled. 
	What is source code? The human-readable version of a program 
created in a high-level language by a programmer is called source code. 
Just as with an assembly language program, source code cannot be directly 
executed by a microprocessor. It must first be translated into machine lan-
guage. This translation can be accomplished by a compiler or an interpreter.
 How does a compiler work? A compiler converts all the statements 
in a program in a single batch, and the resulting collection of instructions, 
called object code, is placed in a new file. Software supplied at download 
sites and apps distributed for mobile devices are files containing object code 
that is ready for the processor to execute. Figure 11-18 illustrates how a 
compiler works.
 How does an interpreter work? As an alternative to a compiler, an 
interpreter converts and executes one statement at a time while the pro-
gram is running. After a statement is executed, the interpreter converts and 
executes the next statement, and so on. There are two major differences 
between a compiler and an interpreter. First, a compiler creates a stand-
alone file of machine code, whereas an interpreter does not create any new 
files. Second, a compiler does not carry out any instructions, but an inter-
preter does. Figure 11-19 illustrates how an interpreter works.

SECTION B, Unit 11
 Why do programmers care about compilers and interpreters? 
When writing and testing a program, the extra step for compiling takes a 
few seconds, so it slows down the programming process. In addition, a pro-
gram must compile without any errors before it can be run, which forces 
programmers to fix little bugs before viewing the “big picture” as the pro-
gram executes. 
As an analogy, imagine a new car with a diagnostic system that wouldn’t 
start the engine unless the tire pressure, oil level, and other mechanics were 
in perfect order. You might have to make lots of adjustments before you 
could take the car for a test drive. As shown in Figure 11-20, a compiler 
requires programmers to fix all the syntax errors before they can see the 
program running.

 2  min = 1
 3  max = 6

 5  rollAgain = "yes"

 7  while rollAgain == "yes" or rollAgain == "y":

click the Execute tab to see the

An interpreter executes as many instructions as possible until an error is 
encountered, allowing programmers to test the program and easily locate 
errors. One problem with interpreters is that they leave the source code 
exposed. Software applications distributed as source code can easily be 
copied and modified by users. Another problem with interpreters is that they 
operate more slowly than a compiled program, which decreases efficiency 
and negatively affects the user experience.
 How do programmers choose which to use? Many programming 
languages have both compilers and interpreters. Programmers may choose 
to use an interpreter for the initial phases of coding and testing, and then 
use a compiler to create the object code for distribution.
Some languages, such as C++ and Java, are traditionally coded using 
compilers. Programmers just get accustomed to the process of debugging 
syntax errors before seeing any iteration of their programs running.
Some languages do not generally use compilers. These scripting 
languages are distributed as human-readable source code, not as object 
code. Programmers select scripting languages such as Perl, PHP, Ruby, 
and JavaScript for Web development because they can be incorporated in 
HTML documents or installed as server-side scripts.

Paradigms and Languages
Just how many programming languages are there? Estimates vary, but some 
researchers suggest that there are about as many programming languages 
as human languages—more than 8,000. The number of well-established 
programming languages is about 600. With so many languages to choose 
from, which programming languages should a programmer know? How do 
programmers select the best language for a project? Let’s find the answers 
to these questions.
	How do programmers choose a language? The choice of a 
programming language is not random. When learning to code, entering the 
job market, or embarking upon a software development project, program-
ming language choices can contribute to success or to failure.
Because there are so many programming languages, it is handy to clas-
sify them. You have already seen how programming languages can be 
classified into five generations, beginning with first-generation machine lan-
guages. Historical classifications indicate when languages emerged, how 
they developed, and which languages are newest. 
Many other classification schemes exist. Classifying languages by their 
popularity is helpful for gauging which languages are trending and might 
be useful for job seekers. Programming languages can also be categorized 
by their complexity, by their security vulnerabilities, and by their syntax. 
Believe it or not, there is an entire category of curly bracket programming 
languages that use { and } to group instructions into blocks similar to para-
graphs. Another approach to classifying programming languages is based 
on programming paradigms. 
	What is a programming paradigm? The phrase ­programming 
paradigm refers to a way of conceptualizing and structuring the tasks a com-
puter ­performs. Whereas some programming tasks can be best approached 
by focusing on the steps required to complete a specific computation, other 
tasks might be approached by focusing on the data that forms the basis for 
the computation. 
Once a programmer has evaluated the best paradigm for a project, a pro-
gramming language that supports the paradigm can be selected. Some 
programming languages support a single paradigm. Other programming 
languages—referred to as multiparadigm languages—support more than 
one paradigm. Figure 11-21 provides a brief description of today’s three 
most popular programming paradigms.
Paradigm
Description
Procedural
Emphasizes linear steps that ­provide the computer with 
instructions on how to solve a ­problem or carry out a task
Object-oriented
Formulates programs as a series of objects and ­methods 
that interact to perform a specific task
Declarative
Focuses on the use of facts and rules to describe a prob-
lem

	What is the most practical approach to programming lan-
guage classification? Programmers generally find it useful to classify 
languages based on the types of projects for which they are used. Some lan-
guages tend to be used for Web programming, while others tend to be used 
for mobile apps, games, and enterprise applications. An additional group of 
older programming languages tend to be used for programming legacy sys-
tems. Figure 11-22, which continues onto the next page, describes the most 
commonly used programming languages based on their use for specific 
types of projects.

Toolsets
Programming languages can be downloaded and installed just like any soft-
ware application. Interactive programming environments are also available 
online as Web apps that don’t require installation. Serious programmers 
typically download and install programming tools for local use, however, 
and the language is just one component of their toolset. 
	What tools do programmers use? In addition to a programming lan-
guage, the programmer’s toolbox may include a complier, a debugger, and 
an editor. Some programmers like to obtain programming tools à la carte by 
picking up a compiler from one vendor, selecting an interactive debugger 
from another vendor, and using any handy editor, such as Notepad. More 
typically, programmers download or purchase an SDK or IDE that contains 
a collection of programming tools.
	What is an SDK? An SDK (software development kit) is a collection of 
language-specific programming tools that enables a programmer to develop 
applications for a specific computer platform, such as Windows PCs. A basic 
SDK includes a compiler, documentation about the language and syntax, 
and sample code. More sophisticated SDKs might also include an editor, a 
debugger, a visual user interface design module, and APIs. 
The components of an SDK are sometimes a hodgepodge of tools without 
consistent user interfaces for the programmer. For a more polished devel-
opment environment, programmers turn to IDEs.
	What is an IDE? An IDE (integrated development environment) is a 
type of SDK that packages a set of development tools into a sleek pro-
gramming application. The modules in the application—editor, compiler, 
debugger, and user interface development tool—have a uniform set of 
menus and controls, which ­simplifies the programming process. Xcode is 
an example of an IDE. It is used for developing software for Macs, iPads, 
and iPhones. Android Studio is also an IDE. It is used to create apps for 
Android devices (Figure 11-23).

	What’s an API? In the context of computer programming, API is an 
abbreviation for application program interface or application programming 
interface. An API is a set of application or operating system functions that 
programmers can add to the programs they create. 
The Windows API, for example, includes code for an assortment of dialog 
box controls familiar to anyone who uses a PC. The ability to browse through 
file folders is one element of the Windows API that might be useful in any 
application program that allows users to open or save files. APIs are usually 
supplied as part of an SDK.
	Do programmers use standard programming tools to develop 
computer games? At the core of every computer game is a program that 
ties together the virtual game world, characters, weapons, and other objects. 
Most of these programs are written using standard SDK and IDE program-
ming tools. Additional tools such as those in Figure 11-24 are also useful.
Graphics Tools
On commercial game projects, artists usually create, render, and animate game objects 
using bitmap, vector, 3-D, and animation graphics software. For indies without artistic 
talent, 3-D animated characters can be obtained from freelance artists who peddle their 
creations on the Web at sites such as Animation Central. 
A type of special effects software called a particle renderer helps developers create explo-
sions, flares, fog, and fairy dust. 
Motion Tools
Pathfinder algorithms distributed as APIs map character routes, limiting them to valid paths 
and preventing them from walking through walls (unless they are magic users).
Audio Tools
Developers also use a variety of audio and sound software to record, edit, and mix sound 
effects for gun shots, explosions, footsteps, and so on. Even non-musicians can generate 
upbeat background music by using MIDI or tracker software. Tracker sound effects are pop-
ular for explosions, and original music produced by tracker software can give games added 
audio dimensions.
Game Play Tools
Commercially available artificial intelligence APIs and components can plug into programs 
to control the actions of autonomous, non-player-controlled monsters and foes. Physics 
APIs can tie into objects to make them respond with lifelike realism to gravity, momentum, 
and collisions. Digital rights management (DRM) tools are also available to help game devel-
opers protect their creations from piracy and illegal copying.
Developer Packages
Microsoft’s DirectX SDK contains APIs that are popular tools for game developers. It 
includes components for 2-D and 3-D drawing, game-play interfaces, network distribution, 
and multiplayer control.

that the first computer programmers also took a

algorithms 
Early approaches to computer programming were based on writing step-
by-step instructions for the computer to follow. This technique is still in 
widespread use today and provides an easy starting point for learning what 
programming is all about. In this section, the examples are written in Python 
because it is one of the easiest programming languages to grasp.
	What is procedural programming? The traditional approach to 
programming uses a procedural paradigm (sometimes called an impera-
tive paradigm) to conceptualize the solution to a problem as a sequence of 
steps. A program written in a procedural language consists of self-contained 
instructions in a sequence that indicates how a task is to be performed or a 
problem is to be solved. 
A programming language that supports the procedural paradigm is called a 
procedural language. Machine languages, assembly languages, BASIC, 
COBOL, Fortran, C, and many other third-generation languages are classi-
fied as procedural languages. 
Procedural languages are well suited for problems that can be easily solved 
with a linear, step-by-step algorithm. Programs created with procedural lan-
guages have a starting point and an ending point. The flow of execution 
from the beginning to the end of a program is essentially linear—that is, the 
computer begins at the first instruction and carries out the prescribed series 
of instructions until it reaches the end of the program.
	What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a set of steps for carrying 
out a task that can be written down and implemented. For example, the 
algorithm for making a batch of macaroni and cheese is a set of steps that 
includes boiling water, cooking the ­macaroni in the water, and making a 
cheese sauce (Figure 11-25). 
An important characteristic of a correctly formulated algorithm is that care-
fully following the steps guarantees that you can accomplish the task for 
which the algorithm was designed. If the recipe on a macaroni and cheese 
package is a correctly formulated algorithm, by following the recipe, you 
should be guaranteed a successful batch of macaroni and cheese.

	How do I write an algorithm? An algorithm for a computer program 
is a set of steps that explains how to begin with known information specified 
in a problem statement and how to manipulate that information to arrive at a 
solution. 
Algorithms are usually written in a format that is not ­specific to a particu-
lar programming language. This approach allows programmers to focus on 
formulating a correct algorithm without becoming distracted by the detailed 
syntax of a computer programming language. In a later phase of the soft-
ware development process, the algorithm is coded into instructions written 
in a programming language so that a computer can implement it. 
	How do I figure out an algorithm? To design an algorithm, you 
might begin by recording the steps required to solve the problem manually. 
If you take this route with the pizza problem, you must obtain initial informa-
tion about the cost, size, and shape of each pizza. When the pizza program 
runs, it should ask the user to enter the initial information needed to solve 
the problem. Your algorithm might begin like this:
	
Ask the user for the shape of the first pizza and hold it in 
RAM as shape1.
	
Ask the user for the price of the first pizza and hold it in 
RAM as price1.
	
Ask the user for the size of the first pizza and hold it in 
RAM as size1.
Next, your algorithm should specify how to manipulate this information. You 
want the computer to calculate the price per square inch. However, a state-
ment like “Calculate the price per square inch” neither specifies how to do 
the calculation, nor deals with the fact that you must perform different cal-
culations for square and round pizzas. A more appropriate set of statements 
for the algorithm is shown in Figure 11-26.

If shape1 is square then
	
calculate square inches using the formula:
	
squareInches1 = size1 * size1
If shape1 is round then
	
calculate square inches using the formula:
	
squareInches1 = 3.142 * (Size1 / 2) ^2 
squareInchPrice1 = price1 / squareInches1
3. After calculating the area of 
a pizza, the ­computer can calcu-
late the price per square inch.
2. To calculate the area of a 
round pizza, use the formula 
for the area of a circle: πr2. π 
is approximately 3.142. ^2 is 
a notation that indicates the 
exponent 2. 
Figure 11-26: The algorithm for calculating the area of pizzas
Terminology
Remember variables from 
Section A? In most modern 
programming languages, 
variable names begin with 
lowercase letters. When 
a variable is composed of 
multiple words, such as 
pizzaShape, the second word 
begins with an uppercase 
letter.
1. To calculate the area of a 
square pizza, multiply the 
length of one side by the 
length of the other side. 
The sides are the same size 
in a square, so you can use 
the formula size1 * size1.

	What’s next? So far, the algorithm describes how to calculate the price 
per square inch of one pizza. It should specify a similar process for calculat-
ing the price per square inch of the ­second pizza.
Finally, the algorithm should specify how the computer decides what to 
display as the solution. You want the computer to display a message indicat-
ing which pizza has the lowest square-inch cost, so your algorithm should 
include steps like the following:
If squareInchPrice1 is less than squareInchPrice2 then display 
the ­message “Pizza 1 is the best deal.”
If squareInchPrice2 is less than squareInchPrice1 then display 
the ­message “Pizza 2 is the best deal.”
But don’t forget to indicate what you want the computer to do if the price per 
square inch is the same for both pizzas:
If squareInchPrice1 equals squareInchPrice2 then display the 
­message “Both pizzas are the same deal.” 
The complete algorithm for the pizza problem is shown in Figure 11-27.
Ask the user for the shape of the first pizza and hold it in RAM as shape1.
Ask the user for the price of the first pizza and hold it in RAM as price1.
Ask the user for the size of the first pizza and hold it in RAM as size1.
If shape1 is square then
 	
calculate the square inches using the formula:
	
squareInches1 = size1 * size1
If shape1 is round then
	
calculate the square inches using the formula:
	
squareInches1 = 3.142 * (size1 / 2) ^2
squareInchPrice1 = price1 / squareInches1
Ask the user for the shape of the second pizza and hold it in RAM as shape2.
Ask the user for the price of the second pizza and hold it in RAM as price2.
Ask the user for the size of the second pizza and hold it in RAM as size2.
If shape2 is square then 
	
calculate the square inches using the formula:
	
squareInches2 = size2 * size2
If shape2 is round then 
	
calculate the square inches using the formula:
	
squareInches2 = 3.142 * (size2 / 2) ^2
squareInchPrice2 = price2 / squareInches2
If squareInchPrice1 < squareInchPrice2 then 
	
display the message "Pizza 1 is the best deal."
If squareInchPrice2 < squareInchPrice1 then 
	
display the message "Pizza 2 is the best deal."
If squareInchPrice1 = squareInchPrice2 then 
	
display the message "Both pizzas are the same deal."

SECTION c, Unit 11
pseudocode and flowcharts
You can express an algorithm in several different ways, including structured 
English, pseudocode, and flowcharts. These tools are not programming lan-
guages, and they cannot be processed by a ­computer. Their purpose is to 
give programmers a way to document their ideas for program design.
	What’s structured English? Structured English is a subset of the 
English language with a limited selection of sentence structures that reflect 
processing activities. Refer to Figure 11-27 on the previous page to see how 
structured English is used to express the algorithm for the pizza program.
	What’s pseudocode? Another way to express an algorithm is with 
pseudocode. Pseudocode is a notational system for algorithms that is less 
formal than a programming language, but more formal than simply jotting 
down notes. When writing pseudocode, programmers are allowed to incor-
porate command words and syntax from the computer language they intend 
to use for the actual program. Compare Figure 11-27 with Figure 11-28 and 
see if you can identify some of the differences between structured English 
and pseudocode.

	What is a flowchart? A third way to express an algorithm is to use a 
flowchart. A flowchart is a graphical representation of the way a computer 
should progress from one instruction to the next when it performs a task. 
The flowchart for the pizza program is shown in Figure 11-29 on the next 
page.

	How do I know if my algorithm is correct? Before finalizing the 
algorithm for a computer program, you should perform a walkthrough to 
verify that your algorithm works. To perform a walkthrough for a simple 
program, you can use a calculator, paper, and pencil to step through the 
algorithm using realistic test data. 
For more complex programs, a walkthrough might consist of a verbal 
presentation to a group of programmers who can help identify logical 
errors in the algorithm and suggest ways to make the algorithm more 
efficient. Figure 11-30 illustrates how to check the pseudocode for the 
pizza program.

Flow control
Have you ever wondered why computers seem so versatile and why they 
are able to adjust to so many situations? A key to this versatility is the pro-
grammer’s ability to control the flow of a program. Let’s see what that means.
	What is flow control? Flow control refers to the sequence in which a 
computer executes program instructions. During sequential execution, the 
first instruction in the program is executed first, then the second instruction, 
and so on, to the last instruction in the program. Here is a simple program 
written in the Python programming language that outputs This is the 
first line. and then outputs This is the next line.: 
print ("This is the first line.")
print ("This is the next line.")
	Is there an alternative to sequential execution? Some algo-
rithms specify that a program must execute instructions in an order different 
from the sequence in which they are listed, skip some instructions under 
certain circumstances, or repeat instructions. Control structures are 
instructions that specify the sequence in which a program is executed. Most 
procedural languages have three types of control structures: sequence con-
trols, selection controls, and repetition controls. 
A sequence control structure changes the order in which instructions are 
carried out by directing the computer to execute an instruction elsewhere 
in the program. In the ­following simple program, a goto command tells the 
computer to jump directly to the instruction labeled “Widget”: 
Follow the flowchart in Figure 11-31 to see how the goto statement affects 
the output.
Start
End
Print "This is the first line."
Print "This is the next line."

SECTION c, Unit 11
	When do programmers use GOTO? Never! Although it is the 
simplest control structure, the goto command is rarely used by skilled pro-
grammers because it can lead to programs that are difficult to understand 
and maintain. 
In 1968, the journal Communications of the ACM published a now-famous 
letter from the Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra, called “Go To 
Statement Considered Harmful.” In his letter, Dijkstra explained that inju-
dicious use of the goto statement in programs makes it difficult for other 
programmers to understand the underlying algorithm, which in turn means 
that such programs are difficult to correct, improve, or revise. 
	So what is the alternative to GOTO? Experienced programmers 
prefer to use sequence controls other than goto to transfer program execu-
tion to a subroutine, procedure, or function. A function is a section of code 
that is part of a program, but is not included in the main sequential execu-
tion path. 
A sequence control structure directs the computer to the statements con-
tained in a function; but when these statements have been executed, the 
computer neatly returns to the main program. Figure 11-32 shows the exe-
cution path of a program that transfers execution to a function.
#This program calculates the square of any number
#between 1 and 10 that is entered.
number = input("Pick a number between 1 and 10: ")
number = checkinput(number)
numberSquared = number * number
print (str(number), " squared is ", str(numberSquared))
def checkinput(number):
    while number < 1 or number > 10:
        number = int(input("You must enter a number between 1 and 10: "))
    return number




 The program asks the user to enter a number.
 Next, the program takes the number and jumps to 
the checkinput function.
 In the checkinput function, the program makes 
sure the number is between 1 and 10.
 A valid number between 1 and 10 is returned to 
the main program, where the number is squared 
and displayed.

QuickCheck
What is the key difference 
between a function and the goto 
command?
a.	 Goto transfers control to 
another part of the program.
b.	 Goto jumps to another part 
of the program without a way 
to return.
c.	 Goto simplifies program logic.

	Can the computer make decisions while it executes a pro-
gram? A selection control structure tells a ­computer what to do based on 
whether a condition is true or false. A simple example of a selection control 
structure is the if...else command. 
The following program uses this command to decide whether a number 
entered is greater than 18. If the number is greater than or equal to 18, 
the computer prints You can vote! If the number is less than 18, the 
program performs the else instruction and prints You are not old 
enough to vote.
age = input("Enter your age: ")
if age >= 18:
		
print ("You can vote!")
else: print ("You are not old enough to vote.")
Figure 11-33 uses a flowchart to illustrate how a computer follows com-
mands in a decision structure.

	Can a computer automatically repeat a series of instructions? 
A repetition control structure directs the computer to repeat one or more 
instructions until a ­certain condition is met. The section of code that repeats 
is usually referred to as a loop or an iteration. There are several styles of 
loops, and in various languages the loop command words vary. For exam-
ple, a loop that begins with for may function differently than a loop that 
beings with while or do. 
In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy has to click the heels of her ruby slippers three 
times and recite “There’s no place like home.” The following short Python 
program outputs the magic words three times.
for x in range(1, 4):
    print ("There's no place like home.") 
Follow the path of program execution in Figure 11-34 to see how a com-
puter executes a series of commands in a repetition structure.

To get a better idea of how a for loop works, pretend that you’re the 
computer executing the short set of instructions below. You can use the box 
labeled x in the margin as a RAM location. The computer would also have a 
screen on which to display output. You can use the Output box in the margin 
for that purpose. Now, walk through the loop.
for x in range(1, 4):
    print ("There's no place like home.") 
print ("The end.")
1. As the computer, the first time you see the instruction for x in 
range(1, 4):, you set x equal to 1. To do so, write the number 1 in the x 
box in the margin. 
2. Now, execute the next instruction, print ("There's no place 
like home."). To do so, write the phrase “There’s no place like home.” in 
the Output box. (Hint: Write small; there’s more to go in the Output box.)
3. The statement print ("The end.") is not in the loop. How do you 
know? Because it is not indented. You have to finish looping before you can 
execute that statement.
4. Go back to the command for x in range(1, 4):. Because this is 
the second time you have executed this statement, put a 2 in the x box in the 
margin. (Hint: You can erase the 1 that was there previously.) 
5. You must check whether the value in the x box is 4. Why? Because the 
command for x in range(1, 4): means you can continue to loop 
only if x is less than 4. Now, x is only 2, so you can proceed.
6. Go to the next instruction, which is print ("There's no place 
like home."). Write this sentence again in the Output box.
7. Moving on, loop back to the for statement. 
8. Continue by changing the value in the x box to 3. Check the x box to make 
sure it does not contain 4 yet. It doesn’t, so ­continue.
9. The next line instructs you to print ("There's no place like 
home."). Write this sentence again in the Output box. Increase the value in 
the x box to 4. Go back once again to the for statement. 
10. This time, when you check whether the value in x is 4, it is. That means 
the loop is complete, and you should jump to the statement past the end of 
the loop.
11. The next statement is print ("The end."). Do that, and you’ve 
completed the program.
12. When your program is complete, the variable x should contain the 
number 4, and the Output box should contain:
There’s no place like home.
There’s no place like home.
There’s no place like home.
The end.

program? The code for the pizza program includes control structures, key-
words, and syntax provided by the programming language. The completed 
pizza program, written in Python, is provided in Figure 11-35.
# The Pizza Program
# Tells you which of two pizzas is the best deal 
# by calculating the price per square inch of each pizza.
# Collect information for first pizza.
shape1 = input("Enter the shape of pizza 1: ")
price1 = float(input("Enter the price of pizza 1: "))
size1 = float(input("Enter the size of pizza 1: "))
# Calculate price per square inch for first pizza.
# If the first pizza is square, multiply side1 by side2.
if shape1 == "square":
    squareInches1 = size1 * size1
# For a round pizza, calculate area using pi (3.142).
else:
    squareInches1 = 3.142 * (size1 / 2) **2
squareInchPrice1 = price1 / squareInches1
# Collect information for second pizza.
shape2 = input("Enter the shape of pizza 2: ")
price2 = float(input("Enter the price of pizza 2: ")) 
size2 = float(input("Enter the size of pizza 2: "))
# Calculate price per square inch for second pizza.
if shape2 == "square":
    squareInches2 = size2 * size2
else:
    squareInches2 = 3.142 * (size2 / 2) **2
squareInchPrice2 = price2 / squareInches2
# Decide which pizza is the best deal 
# and display results.
if squareInchPrice1 < squareInchPrice2: 
    print ("Pizza 1 is the best deal.")
if squareInchPrice2 < squareInchPrice1: 
    print ("Pizza 2 is the best deal.")
if squareInchPrice1 == squareInchPrice2:
    print ("Both pizzas are the same deal.")

procedural applications
Procedural languages encourage programmers to approach problems by 
breaking the solution down into a series of steps. This approach has certain 
advantages, but it has disadvantages as well.
	What are the most popular procedural languages? The earli-
est programming languages were procedural. Fortran, developed by IBM 
in 1954, was the first widely used standardized computer language. Its 
implementation of the procedural paradigm set the pattern for other popular 
procedural languages, such as COBOL, Forth, APL, ALGOL, PL/1, Pascal, 
C, Ada, and BASIC. Python, used for the examples in this section, is a mul-
tiparadigm language suitable for procedural programming.
	What kinds of problems are best suited to the procedural 
approach? The procedural approach is best used for problems that can 
be solved by following a step-by-step algorithm. It is widely used for trans-
action processing, which is characterized by the use of a single algorithm 
applied to many different sets of data. For example, in the banking indus-
try, the algorithm for calculating checking account balances is the same, 
regardless of the amounts deposited and withdrawn. Many problems in 
math and science also lend themselves to the procedural approach. 
	What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proce-
dural paradigm? The procedural approach and procedural languages 
tend to produce programs that run quickly and use system resources effi-
ciently. It is a classic approach understood by many programmers, software 
engineers, and systems analysts. 
The procedural paradigm is quite flexible and powerful, which allows pro-
grammers to apply it to many types of problems. For example, although the 
programming example in this section worked only for round and square piz-
zas, it could be modified to handle rectangular pizzas, too.
The downside of the procedural paradigm is that it does not fit gracefully 
with certain types of problems—those that are unstructured or those with 
very complex algorithms. The procedural paradigm has also been criti-
cized because it forces programmers to view problems as a series of steps, 
whereas some problems might be better visualized as interacting objects or 
as interrelated words, concepts, and ideas.

objects and classes
The object-oriented paradigm is based on objects and classes that can be 
defined and manipulated by program code. The Java programming lan-
guage is used for the examples in this section because it is one of today’s 
most popular languages for implementing object-oriented programs.
	What is the basic focus of the object-oriented paradigm? The 
object-­oriented paradigm is based on the idea that the solution for a prob-
lem can be visualized in terms of objects that interact with each other. Rather 
than envisioning a program as a list of steps, programmers who work within 
the object-oriented paradigm envision a program as data objects that essen-
tially network with each other to exchange data (Figure 11-36).
CLASS: Pizza 
Pizza objects
	What is an object? In the context of the OO paradigm, an object is 
a unit of data that represents an abstract or real-world entity, such as a 
­person, place, or thing. An object can represent a $10.99 small round pizza. 
Another object can represent a pizza delivery guy named Jack Flash. Yet 
another object can represent a customer who lives at 22 W. Pointe Rd. 
	What’s the difference between an object and a class? The real 
world contains lots of pizzas, customers, and delivery guys. These objects 
can be defined in a general way by using classes. Whereas an object is a 
single instance of an entity, a class is a template for a group of objects with 
similar characteristics. 
For example, a Pizza class defines a group of gooey Italian snacks that are 
made in a variety of sizes, crafted into rectangular or round shapes, and 
sold for various prices. A class can produce any number of unique objects, 
as shown in Figure 11-37.

SECTION d, Unit 11
	How are objects and classes used to solve problems? When 
taking the object-oriented approach to a problem, one of the first steps is to 
identify the objects that pertain to a solution. As you might expect, the solu-
tion to the pizza problem requires some pizza objects.
Certain characteristics of pizzas provide information necessary to solve the 
problem. This information—the price, size, and shape of a pizza—provides 
the structure for the Pizza class. 
A class is defined by attributes and methods. A class attribute defines the 
characteristics of a set of objects. You will learn about methods, which define 
actions, later in this section.
Each class attribute generally has a name, scope, and data type. One class 
attribute of the Pizza class might be named pizzaPrice. Its scope can be 
defined as public or private: 
• A public attribute is available for use by any routine in the program. 
• A private attribute can be accessed only from the routine in which it is 
defined. 
The pizzaPrice attribute’s data type can be defined as double, which means 
that it can be any decimal number, such as 12.99. In the Databases Unit, 
you encountered the idea of data types where a field could be defined as 
text, an integer, a real number, a date, and so on. Programming languages 
use similar data types, but the terminology may be different. Figure 11-38 
describes data types used by Java to specify class attributes.

Int
Integer whole numbers

Double
Numbers with decimal places
12.99

Object-oriented programmers often use UML (Unified Modeling Language) 
diagrams to plan the classes for a program. The UML diagram in Figure 
11-39 shows one possible way to envision the Pizza class.

butes are indented for readability.

inheritance
The object-oriented paradigm endows classes with quite a bit of flexibil-
ity. For the pizza program, objects and classes make it easy to compare 
round pizzas to rectangular pizzas rather than just to square pizzas. 
	How flexible are classes? Suppose you want to compare a 10-inch 
round pizza to a rectangular pizza that has a length of 11 inches and a width 
of 8 inches. The Pizza class in Figure 11-39 on the previous page holds only 
one measurement for each pizza: pizzaSize. This single attribute won’t work 
for rectangular pizzas, which might have a different length and width. 
Should you modify the class definition to add attributes for pizzaLength and 
pizzaWidth? No, because these attributes are necessary only for rectangu-
lar pizzas, not for round pizzas. An OO feature called inheritance provides 
flexibility to deal with objects’ unique characteristics.
	What is inheritance? In object-oriented jargon, inheritance 
refers to passing certain characteristics from one class to other classes. For 
example, to solve the pizza problem, a programmer might decide to use a 
RoundPizza class and a RectanglePizza class. These two new classes can 
inherit attributes from the Pizza class, such as pizzaShape and pizzaPrice. 
You can add specialized characteristics to the new classes. The 
RectanglePizza class can have attributes for length and width, and the 
RoundPizza class can have an attribute for diameter.
The process of producing new classes with inherited attributes creates a 
class hierarchy that includes a superclass and subclasses. A superclass, 
such as Pizza, is any class from which attributes can be inherited. A 
subclass (or derived class), such as RoundPizza or RectanglePizza, is any 
class that inherits attributes from a superclass (Figure 11-40).

SECTION d, Unit 11
	What’s the code for a subclass? Java uses the extends command 
to link a subclass to a superclass. The statement class RectanglePizza 
extends Pizza means “create a class called RectanglePizza that’s 
derived from the superclass called Pizza.” Figure 11-41 contains the Java 
code that creates attributes for the RectanglePizza class.
class RectanglePizza extends Pizza
{
	
double pizzaLength;
	
double pizzaWidth;
}
Figure 11-41: Java code for a rectanglepizza subclass
methods and messages
In an object-oriented program, the objects interact. Programmers specify 
how this interaction takes place by creating methods. 
	What is a method? A method is a segment of code that defines an 
action. The names of methods end in a set of parentheses, such as com-
pare() or getArea(). The code that is contained in a method may be a series 
of steps similar to code segments in procedural programs. 
	What can a method do? A method can perform a variety of tasks, 
such as ­collecting input, performing calculations, making comparisons, exe-
cuting decisions, and producing output. For example, the pizza program can 
use a method named compare() to ­compare the square-inch prices of two 
pizzas and display a message indicating which pizza is the best deal.
	What is the Java code for the compare() method? A method 
begins with a line that names the method and can include a description of 
its scope and data type. The scope—public or private—specifies which parts 
of the program can access the method. The data type specifies the kind of 
data, if any, that the method produces. 
The initial line of code is followed by one or more lines that specify the cal-
culation, comparison, or routine that the method performs. Figure 11-42 
illustrates the code for the compare() method.
public compare(Pizza Pizza1, Pizza Pizza2)
{
	
if (Pizza1.squareInchPrice < Pizza2.squareInchPrice)
	
   System.out.println("Pizza 1 is the best deal!");
        
	
if (Pizza1.squareInchPrice > Pizza2.squareInchPrice)
	
   System.out.println("Pizza 2 is the best deal!");
      if (Pizza1.squareInchPrice == Pizza2.squareInchPrice 
	
   System.out.println("The pizzas are the same deal!");
}

	What activates a method? A method is activated by a message, 
which is included as a line of program code that is sometimes referred 
to as a call. For example, in a Java program, a line of code such as 
­compare(Pizza1, Pizza2) produces a message used to activate or call 
the compare() method. 
In the object-oriented world, objects often interact to solve a problem by 
sending and receiving messages. For example, a pizza object might receive 
a message asking for the pizza’s area or price per square inch (Figure 
11-43). 
	How do methods relate to classes? Methods can be defined along 
with the class they affect. The getSquareInchPrice() method pertains to piz-
zas of any shape, so it can be defined as part of the Pizza class. To calculate 
the square-inch price, however, it is necessary to know the area of a pizza. 
That calculation can be achieved by defining a getArea() method. 
The area calculation for round pizzas is different from the calculation for 
rectangular pizzas, so the getArea() method should become part of the 
RoundPizza and RectanglePizza subclasses, as indicated by the UML dia-
gram in Figure 11-44.

SECTION d, Unit 11
	How does the getArea() method work? If you have been thinking 
ahead a bit, you might wonder how a programmer can define the getArea() 
method to perform two ­different calculations: one that calculates the area of 
a rectangle by multiplying its length times its width, and another that calcu-
lates the area of a circle using the formula πr2. An object-oriented concept 
called polymorphism makes it possible to assign more than one formula to 
the getArea() method.
	What is polymorphism? Polymorphism, sometimes called overload-
ing, is the ability to redefine a method in a subclass. It allows programmers 
to create a single, generic name for a procedure that behaves in unique 
ways for different classes. 
In the pizza program, for example, both the RectanglePizza and RoundPizza 
classes can have a getArea() method. The calculation that getArea() per-
forms is defined one way for the RectanglePizza class and another way 
for the RoundPizza class. Figure 11-45 illustrates how polymorphism allows 
subclasses to tailor methods to fit their unique requirements.

For round pizzas, the

	How does the code for the round getArea() method differ 
from the code for the rectangle getArea() method? The code for 
the getArea() method defined in the RoundPizza class asks users to key 
in, or enter, the pizza’s diameter. The method then divides the diameter by 
2 to arrive at the radius. The value for the radius is used in the πr2 calcula-
tion—3.142 * (radius * radius)—for the area of a circle.
The getArea() method defined in the RectanglePizza class asks users to key 
in the length of the pizza and then its width. This data is used in the calcula-
tion that multiplies length times width to produce the area of a rectangular 
pizza. Figure 11-46 illustrates the Java code for the getArea() methods. The 
lines that begin with // are remarks.

	What are the advantages of polymorphism? Polymorphism 
provides OO programs with easy extensibility and can help simplify pro-
gram control structures. For example, if one of the pizzerias decides to 
get creative with pizza shapes, it would be easy to extend the pizza pro-
gram to work with triangular pizzas. To extend the program, simply define a 
TrianglePizza class that includes attributes for pizzaWidth and pizzaHeight 
and tailor its getArea() method for calculating the area of a triangle. 
The ability to tailor the getArea() method for round and square pizzas 
allows ­programmers to simplify program code. As you can imagine, 
creating separate methods with unique names, such as getAreaRound-
Pizza(), getAreaRectanglePizza(), and getAreaTrianglePizza(), would 
add to the program’s complexity and make it more difficult to extend the 
program for other pizza shapes.

OO program structure
So far in this section, you have learned how objects and methods interact 
to solve the pizza problem. You know that the pizza program uses a Pizza 
class and two subclasses: RectanglePizza and RoundPizza. 
You also know that these classes include the getSquareInchPrice() and 
getArea() methods to perform calculations that supply data for solving the 
problem. You should also remember that the compare() method is used to 
manipulate pizza objects to determine which is the best deal.
	How do the classes and methods fit together? The classes and 
methods defined for the pizza program must be placed within the structure of 
a Java program, which contains class definitions, defines methods, initiates 
the comparison, and outputs results. Figure 11-47 provides an overview of 
the program structure.
Pizza Class Definition
• Define Pizza as a class with attributes for shape and price. 
• Define the getSquareInchPrice() method that collects input for the 
pizza price.
• Calculate a pizza’s square-inch price.
RectanglePizza Class Definition
• Define RectanglePizza as a subclass of Pizza with attributes for length 
and width. 
• Define the getArea() method that collects input for the pizza length and 
width to calculate area.
RoundPizza Class Definition
• Define RoundPizza as a subclass of Pizza with an attribute for diam-
eter. 
• Define a getArea() method that collects input for the pizza diameter and 
then calculates area.
Compare() Method
• Compare the square-inch price of two pizzas and output the results.
Main Module
• Set up variables, and then create objects for Pizza1 and Pizza2.
• Activate the getArea(), getSquareInchPrice(), and compare() methods.

	How does a Java program work? The computer begins executing a 
Java program by locating a standard method called main(), which contains 
code to send messages to objects by calling methods. 
For the pizza program, the main() method includes code that defines a few 
variables and then asks the user to enter the shape of the first pizza. If the 
shape entered is Round, the program creates an object called Pizza1 that 
is a member of the RoundPizza class. If the shape entered is Rectangle, 
the ­program creates an object called Pizza1 that is a member of the 
RectanglePizza class. 
After the pizza object is created, the program uses the getArea() method to 
calculate its area. The program then uses the getSquareInchPrice() method 
to calculate the pizza’s square-inch price. 
When the calculations are complete for the first pizza, the program per-
forms the same process for the second pizza. Finally, the program uses the 
compare() method to compare the square-inch prices of the two pizzas and 
output a statement about which one is the best deal. 
Because it is not the goal of this section to teach you the particulars of 
Java ­programming, don’t worry about the detailed syntax of the Java code. 
Instead, refer to Figure 11-48 to get an overview of the activity that takes 
place in the main() method for the pizza program.
public static void main(String[] args)
  {
     Pizza Pizza1;
     Pizza Pizza2;
     String pizzaShape;
     pizzaShape = Keyin.inString("Enter the shape of the first pizza: ");
     if (pizzaShape.equals("Round"))
	
{
       Pizza1 = new RoundPizza();
      }
     else 
        Pizza1 = new RectanglePizza();
     Pizza1.getArea();
     Pizza1.getSquareInchPrice();
     pizzaShape = Keyin.inString("Enter the shape of the second pizza: ");
     if (pizzaShape.equals("Round"))
	
  Pizza2 = new RoundPizza();
     else 
        Pizza2 = new RectanglePizza();
     Pizza2.getArea();
     Pizza2.getSquareInchPrice();
     compare(Pizza1, Pizza2);
  }
1. Define arguments 
for the main() method.
2. Define variables used 
in the main() method.
3. Collect input for the shape of the 
first pizza, and then create an object 
called Pizza1 that belongs to the 
RoundPizza or RectanglePizza class.
4. Use the getArea() and 
getSquareInchPrice() methods to 
calculate the area and square-
inch price for the first pizza.
5. Collect input for the shape of the 
second pizza, and then create an 
object called Pizza2 that belongs to the 
RoundPizza or RectanglePizza class.
6. Use the getArea() and getSquareInchPrice() 
methods to calculate the area and square-inch 
price for the second pizza.
7. Use the compare() method to determine which 
pizza is the best deal, and then print the results.

	What happens when the completed pizza program runs? 
When you run the pizza program, it looks for the main() method. This 
method displays an on-screen prompt that asks for the pizza’s shape. The 
getArea() method displays a prompt for the pizza’s diameter (for a round 
pizza) or the pizza’s length and width (for a rectangular pizza). 
A similar series of prompts appears for the second pizza. The program 
­concludes when the compare() method displays a statement about which 
pizza is the best deal. Figure 11-49 displays the output of the object-oriented 
pizza program.

OO applications
Computer historians believe that SIMULA (SIMUlation LAnguage) was the 
first programming language to work with objects, classes, inheritance, and 
methods. SIMULA was developed in 1962 by two Norwegian computer sci-
entists for the purpose of programming simulations and ­models. SIMULA 
laid the foundation for the object-oriented paradigm.
	How did object-oriented languages evolve? The second major 
development in object-oriented languages came in 1972, when Alan Kay 
began work on the Dynabook project at the Xerox Palo Alto Research 
Center (PARC). Kay developed an easy-to-use programming language 
called Smalltalk that could be used to create programs based on real-world 
objects. 
In 1983, object-oriented features were added to the C programming lan-
guage, and C++ emerged as a popular tool for programming games and 
applications.
Java was originally planned as a programming language for consumer 
electronics, such as interactive cable television boxes, but it evolved into 
an object-oriented programming platform for developing Web applications. 
Java was officially launched in 1995 and has many of the characteristics of 
C++, from which it derives much of its syntax.

 SECTION D
	Which object-oriented languages are popular today? Most of 
today’s popular programming languages include object-oriented features. 
Whether a programmer is using Java, C++, Swift, Python, Objective-C, or 
C#, the language can define classes, objects, and methods.
	What are the advantages of OO? The object-oriented paradigm is 
cognitively similar to the way human beings perceive the real world. Using 
the OO approach, programmers might be able to visualize the solutions to 
problems more easily. 
Facets of the object-oriented ­paradigm can also increase a programmer’s 
efficiency because encapsulation allows objects to be adapted and reused 
in a variety of different programs. Encapsulation refers to the process of 
hiding the internal details of objects and their methods. 
After an object is coded, it becomes a “black box,” which hides its details 
from other objects and allows the data to be accessed using methods. 
Encapsulated objects can be easily reused and modified (Figure 11-50). 
	What are the disadvantages of OO? A potential disadvantage of 
object-oriented programs is runtime efficiency. Object-­oriented programs 
tend to require more memory and processing resources than ­procedural 
programs. Programmers, software engineers, and systems analysts can 
work together to weigh the tradeoffs between the OO approach and runtime 
efficiency.

code inside it, programmers can send it the names of two objects to see which 
one is the best deal.

the declarative paradigm 
Although procedural and object-oriented programming languages can deal 
with decisions and textual data, they begin to stumble when applied to 
problems with complex sequences of interrelated if...then branches. When 
dealing with problems that involve a spiderweb of logic, programmers can 
turn to declarative programming languages. This section focuses on the 
declarative paradigm by offering a little taste of the Prolog language.
	What is the declarative paradigm? In earlier sections of this unit, 
you learned that procedural programming focuses on a step-by-step algo-
rithm, which instructs the computer how to arrive at a solution. You also 
learned that the object-­oriented approach emphasizes classes and methods 
that form objects. In contrast, the declarative paradigm describes aspects 
of a problem that lead to a solution. As in the expression "Well, I do declare!” 
programmers using declarative languages write code that declares, or 
states, facts pertaining to a program.
The declarative paradigm might sound similar to the procedural paradigm, 
but it is fundamentally different. Whereas the procedural paradigm focuses 
on an algorithm that describes a solution, the declarative paradigm focuses 
on describing the problem. The procedural paradigm focuses on how; the 
declarative paradigm focuses on what. Figure 11-51 summarizes these dif-
ferences.
Procedural 
paradigm:
Programs detail how 
to solve a problem
Very efficient for 
number-crunching 
tasks
Object-oriented 
paradigm:
Programs define 
objects, classes, and 
methods
Efficient for problems 
that involve real-
world objects
Declarative 
paradigm:
Programs describe 
the problem
Efficient for 
processing words 
and language
	What are the building blocks for the declarative paradigm? 
Many declarative programming languages, such as Prolog, use a collection 
of facts and rules to describe a problem. In the context of a Prolog program, 
a fact is a statement that provides the computer with basic information for 
solving a problem. In the pizza problem, for ­example, these facts might 
include:
A pizza has a price of $10.99, a size of 12 inches, and a round shape.
Another pizza has a price of $12.00, a size of 11 inches, and a square 
shape.
In the context of a Prolog program, a rule is a general statement about the 
relationship between facts. For example, the following rule is useful for solv-
ing the problem of which pizza is a better deal:
A pizza is a better deal if its square-inch price is less than the square-
inch price of another pizza.

SECTION e, Unit 11
prolog facts
Prolog programming is fun. The language does not have lots of maddening 
syntax rules or a long list of command words to memorize. The punctua-
tion mainly consists of periods, commas, and parentheses, so programmers 
don’t have to track levels and levels of curly brackets as when programming 
in languages such as C++ or Java. Prolog programming is all about facts 
and rules. Let’s begin with how a programmer codes facts.
	How does a programmer code facts? Return to the simple problem 
of deciding which of two round or square pizzas is the best deal based on 
price per square inch. The first step in coding the program using Prolog is 
to enter facts that describe the prices, shapes, and sizes of two pizzas. The 
fact “The shape of a pizza is round.” can be coded this way:
		
shapeof(pizza,round).
The words in parentheses are called arguments. An argument repre-
sents one of the main subjects that a fact describes. The word outside the 
parentheses, called the predicate, describes the relationship between the 
arguments. For example, the ­predicate shapeof describes the relationship 
between pizza and round. Figure 11-52 points out the simple syntax details 
pertaining to capitalization and punctuation for Prolog facts.
shapeof(pizza,round).
A fact begins with 
a lowercase letter.
Arguments are placed 
in parentheses.
Each fact ends 
with a period.
Use lowercase for 
arguments unless 
they are variables.
Use a comma to sepa-
rate arguments.

What is the predicate in Figure 
11-52?

	What is the purpose of the predicate? Although it might seem 
obvious that round describes the shape of a pizza, the predicate must 
not be omitted. The predicate can drastically change the meaning of a 
fact. For example, the facts in Figure 11-53 have the same arguments, 
(joe,fish), but the predicates give the facts very different meanings.
hates(joe,fish). 
Joe hates fish.
name(joe,fish). 
Joe is the name of a fish.
playscardgame(joe,fish). 
Joe plays a card game called fish.
For the pizza program, a series of facts can be used to describe a pizza:
		
priceof(pizza1,10).
		
sizeof(pizza1,12).
		
shapeof(pizza1,square).
Another set of similar facts can be used to describe a second pizza: 
		
priceof(pizza2,12).
		
sizeof(pizza2,14).
		
shapeof(pizza2,round).
Facts can have more than two arguments. For example, a single fact can 
be used to fully describe a pizza:
		
pricesizeshape(pizza1,10,12,square).
Using a series of facts to describe a pizza has some advantages and 
some disadvantages over using a single fact. A single fact tends to make 
a program more compact, whereas multiple facts might provide more 
flexibility. The structure of a fact also affects the syntax for goals that 
produce information.
	What is a goal? The facts in a Prolog program are useful even with-
out any rules. Prolog can manipulate facts in several ways without explicit 
programming. Each fact in a Prolog program is similar to a record in a data-
base, but you can query a Prolog program’s database by asking a question, 
called a goal in Prolog jargon. As an example, the following facts can easily 
be queried by entering goals:
		
priceof(pizza1,10).
		
sizeof(pizza1,12).
		
shapeof(pizza1,square).
		
priceof(pizza2,12).
		
sizeof(pizza2,14).
		
shapeof(pizza2,round).

SECTION e, Unit 11
	How are goals entered? You can ask questions by entering goals 
from the ?- prompt. For example, the goal ?- shapeof(pizza1,square) 
means “Is the shape of pizza1 square?” Prolog searches through the facts 
to see if it can satisfy the goal by finding a match. If a match is found, Prolog 
responds with yes; otherwise, it responds with no. 
This goal might seem trivial if you are working with a small set of facts, which 
are all visible on the screen. Many programs, however, contain hundreds of 
facts, which cannot be displayed on a single screen or easily remembered 
by a programmer.
	What about more creative questions? Prolog allows you to ask 
open-ended questions by replacing constants with variables. A Prolog 
variable is like a placeholder or an empty box, into which Prolog can put 
information gleaned from a fact. A Prolog variable begins with an uppercase 
letter to distinguish it from a constant. The argument Pizza is a variable, 
whereas pizza1 is a constant. The argument Inches is a variable, whereas 
14 is a constant.
Prolog variables are handy tools for formulating open-ended goals. As an 
example, suppose you want to find the size of pizza2. You can obtain this 
information by using the variable Inches in the goal:
 	
?- sizeof(pizza2,Inches). 
Prolog looks for any facts that have sizeof as a predicate and pizza2 as the 
first argument. It responds with the actual value of the second argument:
		
Inches = 14
Much of the power and flexibility of the Prolog language stems from its ability 
to query facts by matching predicates, comparing constants, and instantiat-
ing variables. Figure 11-54 illustrates how to query a set of Prolog facts.
The query asks for the 
size of pizza2 in inches.
Prolog finds the fact 
­sizeof(pizza2,14) and 
­displays the value of the 
second argument—14—as 
the pizza’s size in inches.

The ?- prompt allows you to work with a knowledge base by entering facts, 
rules, and goals. Suppose you have opened a knowledge base containing facts 
about two pizzas. You can enter goals to find their prices, sizes, and shapes.

	What is instantiation? Finding a value for a variable is referred to as 
instantiation. To solve the goal ?- sizeof(pizza2,Inches), a Prolog 
program looks for a fact that begins with sizeof(pizza2....
When Prolog finds the rule sizeof(pizza2,14), the program instanti-
ates, or assigns, the value 14 to the variable Inches (Figure 11-55).
?- sizeof(pizza2,Inches).
priceof(pizza1,10).
sizeof(pizza1,12).
shapeof(pizza1,square).
priceof(pizza2,12).
sizeof(pizza2,14).
shapeof(pizza2,round).

Inches = 14
	How do programmers use instantiation? Instantiation can be 
used to produce information that is not implicitly stored in the database. 
Suppose you want to know the size of the round pizza. The knowledge base 
does not contain a fact like sizeof(roundpizza,14); however, you can 
use a ­conjunction of two goals, as shown in Figure 11-56, to obtain the size 
of the round pizza.
1. To solve this two-part goal, Prolog 
first looks through the knowledge base 
for a fact that fits the shapeof goal.

3. Prolog instantiates pizza2 
to the variable Pizza, and 
then it attempts to solve 
the second part of the goal 
to find the size of pizza2.
2. This fact fits the goal 
shapeof(Pizza,round) and 
states that pizza2 is round.

SECTION e, Unit 11
prolog rules
With just facts and goals, Prolog would be nothing more than a database. 
But the addition of rules gives programmers a set of tools to manipulate the 
facts.
	How does a programmer code Prolog rules? The pizza program 
requires a rule that states, “A pizza is a better deal if its price per square 
inch is less than the price per square inch of the other pizza.” Translated into 
Prolog code, this rule becomes:
		
betterdeal(PizzaX,PizzaY) :-
		
squareinchprice(PizzaX,AmountX),
		
squareinchprice(PizzaY,AmountY),
		
AmountX < AmountY.
Take a look at the logic behind this rule. A Prolog rule consists of a head, a 
body, and a connecting symbol, as described in Figure 11-57.
betterdeal(PizzaX, PizzaY) :-
  squareinchprice(PizzaX,AmountX),
  squareinchprice(PizzaY,AmountY),
  AmountX < AmountY.
The connecting symbol 
:- means “if.”
The head of a rule defines an outcome 
or fact. In this case, the rule is true if 
PizzaX is a better deal than PizzaY.
This clause means “The 
square-inch price of PizzaX 
is an amount designated 
as AmountX.”
This clause means “The 
square-inch price of PizzaY 
is an amount designated 
as AmountY.”
The final clause 
means “AmountX is 
less than AmountY.”
The body 
of the rule 
consists 
of three 
clauses.

	How do Prolog rules work? To understand how the betterdeal rule 
works, we’ll have to perform a little bit of magic. In the completed pizza pro-
gram, there would be a rule that calculates the square-inch price.
Because you don’t yet have such a rule, temporarily assume that the 
square-inch price of the first pizza is .0694 (6.94 cents) and the square-
inch price of the second pizza is .0779 (7.79 cents). These facts can be 
stated as: 
	 	
squareinchprice(pizza1,.0694). 	
 	
	
	
	
	
squareinchprice(pizza2,.0779).
Now, suppose you enter the query ?- betterdeal(pizza1,pizza2), 
which translates to “Is pizza1 a better deal than pizza2?” Figure 11-58 illus-
trates how Prolog uses the betterdeal rule to answer your query.
betterdeal(PizzaX,PizzaY) :- 
   squareinchprice(PizzaX,AmountX),
   squareinchprice(PizzaY,AmountY),
   AmountX < AmountY.
betterdeal(pizza1,pizza2) :-
   squareinchprice(pizza1,AmountX),
   squareinchprice(pizza2,AmountY),
   AmountX < AmountY.
betterdeal(pizza1,pizza2) :-
   squareinchprice(pizza1,.0694),
   squareinchprice(pizza2,.0779),
   .0694 < .0779.
priceof(pizza1,10).
sizeof(pizza1,12).
shapeof(pizza1,square).
priceof(pizza2,12).
sizeof(pizza2,14).
shapeof(pizza2,round).
squareinchprice(pizza1,.0694).
squareinchprice(pizza2,.0779).
?- betterdeal(Pizza1,Pizza2).
Facts
Betterdeal Rule
Query
 The last line now contains a statement that 
is true—.0694 < .0779—which validates the 
rule and produces “yes” as a response to your 
query, “Is pizza1 a better deal than pizza2?”
 Prolog looks through the facts to find the square-
inchprice for pizza1 and pizza2. These prices are 
instantiated to AmountX and AmountY, respectively.
 Prolog instantiates pizza1 to PizzaX and pizza2 to 
PizzaY.

	Does the order of rules affect the way a Prolog program 
runs? When coding programs in a procedural language, such as C, Visual 
Basic, or Python, the order of program instructions is critically important. For 
example, if you place input statements for pizza size and price after the IF 
statements that compare the square-inch prices, the program produces an 
error because it has no numbers to use for the comparison. In contrast, the 
order or sequence of rules in a Prolog program is usually not critical. 
	What does the complete pizza program look like in Prolog? 
The complete pizza program includes the facts that describe two pizzas and 
rules that describe the better deal, square-inch price, and area. Figure 11-59 
contains the Prolog code for the entire pizza program.
priceof(pizza1,10).
sizeof(pizza1,12).
shapeof(pizza1,square).
priceof(pizza2,12).
sizeof(pizza2,14).
shapeof(pizza2,round).
betterdeal(PizzaX,PizzaY) :-
	
squareinchprice(PizzaX,Amount1),
	
squareinchprice(PizzaY,Amount2),
	
Amount1 < Amount2.
area(Pizza,Squareinches) :-
	
sizeof(Pizza,Side),
	
shapeof(Pizza,square),
	
Squareinches is Side * Side.
area(Pizza,Squareinches) :-
	
sizeof(Pizza,Diameter),
	
shapeof(Pizza,round),
	
Radius is Diameter / 2,
	
Squareinches is 3.142 * (Radius * Radius).
squareinchprice(Pizza,Amount) :-
	
area(Pizza,Squareinches),
	
priceof(Pizza,Dollars),
	
Amount is Dollars / Squareinches.

interactive Input
The pizza program on the previous page contains the size, price, and 
shape information for both pizzas. Such a program is not very versatile. 
Because the program contains facts, such as  priceof(pizza1,10) and 
priceof(pizza2,12), it is limited to specific pizzas that cost $10.00 and 
$12.00. The program can be generalized by collecting input from the user 
and storing it in variables or by asserting new facts at runtime.
	How do programmers collect input from the user? To collect 
input, programmers can use read and write statements. Examine the pro-
gram code in Figure 11-60 to see how read and write predicates collect 
user input, and then look at the screen below the code to see how the pro-
gram interacts with users when it is run.
write(user,'enter price of pizza1: '), 
read(user,Price1), assertz(priceof(pizza1,Price1)),
write(user,'enter size of pizza1: '), 
read(user,Size1), assertz(sizeof(pizza1,Size1)),
write(user,'enter shape of pizza1: '), 
read(user,Shape1), assertz(shapeof(pizza1,Shape1)),
write(user,'enter price of pizza2: '), 
read(user,Price2), assertz(priceof(pizza2,Price2)),
write(user,'enter size of pizza2: '), 
read(user,Size2), assertz(sizeof(pizza2,Size2)),
write(user,'enter shape of pizza2: '), 
read(user,Shape2), assertz(shapeof(pizza2,Shape2)),
Prolog uses the write 
predicate to display a 
prompt for input.
The read predicate 
gathers input entered 
by the user, and then 
the assertz predicate 
creates a fact, such as 
priceof(pizza1,12).
When the program 
runs, a series of 
prompts asks users 
for input.
Courtesy of SWI_Prolog
After evaluating the input based 
on the program’s facts and rules, 
Prolog produces a conclusion for 
the betterdeal query.

The initial query asks 
if pizza1 is a better 
deal than pizza2.

declarative logic
Suppose we extend the pizza problem to include several more conditions. 
What if the decision to buy a pizza depends not just on its price, but on 
how quickly the pizza can be baked and whether the pizzeria offers deliv-
ery service. Suddenly the problem involves many more factors. Just how 
many is something a programmer would need to determine before starting 
to code facts and rules.
	How does a programmer plan a declarative program? The logic 
underlying the original pizza program was pretty simple: The pizza with the 
best square-inch price is the best deal. That logic required only one rule. In 
contrast, most real-world problems involve logic that is much more complex. 
Programmers need tools to help organize their thoughts and make provi-
sions for all of the conditions that might exist in the real world. 
A decision table is a tabular method for visualizing and specifying rules 
based on multiple factors. When the decision to buy a pizza depends on 
its price, whether it can be delivered, and how soon it is ready, these three 
factors produce eight possible situations. 
In which of the eight situations would you purchase a pizza? What if the best-
priced pizza is ready in less than 30 minutes, but it can’t be delivered? What 
if the best-priced pizza won’t be ready for an hour? Try to envision how you 
might implement this logic as a series of IF statements in a procedural or OO 
program. Figure 11-61 illustrates how a programmer might construct a deci-
sion table that describes all the rules pertaining to pizza prices, delivery, and 
time.

 Each factor that relates to the pizza purchase is listed in the first column of the upper 
part of the table.

The remaining cells in the upper section of the table describe every possible combination 
of factors. This table has three factors for the decision. That means the table needs eight 
columns to cover all the combinations. This number is calculated as 2number of factors. In 
this case, there are three factors, so 23 is 2 * 2 * 2, or 8.
 The lower part of the table lists actions that are taken based on the factors. The pro-
grammer looks at each column of Ys and Ns to decide if the action should be taken. For 
example, in the column filled with Ys, the action would be to buy the pizza.

declarative applications
As you have seen from the pizza example, it is possible to use a declarative 
language to solve a problem that involves calculations. However, problems 
that require intensive computation are not usually best suited for the declara-
tive paradigm. As a general rule, declarative programming languages are 
most suitable for problems that pertain to words and concepts rather than to 
numbers. 
	What are the advantages of declarative languages? Declarative 
languages offer a highly effective programming environment for problems 
that involve words, concepts, and complex logic. As you learned in this unit, 
declarative languages offer a great deal of flexibility for querying a set of 
facts and rules. These languages also allow programmers to describe prob-
lems using words rather than the abstract structures required by procedural 
and object-oriented languages.
Although not in widespread use, declarative programming is popular in 
several niche markets. The U.S. Forest Service uses Prolog programs for 
resource management. Prolog programs are also used extensively in sci-
entific research. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security experimented 
with a Prolog application developed to comb through social networking sites 
for terrorist activities. Finally, a growing trend is to incorporate Prolog mod-
ules with procedural and object-oriented programs to handle concept and 
language processing.
	What are the disadvantages of declarative languages? 
Currently, declarative languages are not commonly used for production appli-
cations. To some extent, today’s emphasis on the object-oriented paradigm 
has pushed declarative languages out of the mainstream, both in education 
and in the job market. Many aspiring programmers are never introduced to 
declarative languages, so they are not included among the languages evalu-
ated for a ­specific project. 
Declarative languages have a reputation for providing minimal input and 
output capabilities. Although many of today’s Prolog compilers provide 
access to Windows and Mac user interface components, programmers are 
often unaware of this capability. Despite their lack of popularity, declara-
tive languages help to round out a programmer’s repertoire and may offer 
employment opportunities in interesting niche projects.

Issue: What is Fair Use?
Today we think of computers mostly in 
the context of connecting on Facebook, streaming 
music and video from the Web, and playing amusing 
little games like Angry Birds. But behind the scenes, 
there are computers doing some really heavy lifting, 
such as estimating climate change, piecing together 
the human genome, and researching the beginning of 
the universe. 
The computers that delve into these problems are the 
descendants of room-sized machines constructed in 
the 1940s and 1950s that laboriously calculated bal-
listic tables and deciphered Nazi coded messages. 
In the era when only a handful of 
computers existed, some vision-
ary scientists looked toward the 
future and speculated that com-
puters might rival humans in their 
capacity to think. 
In 1950, the well-respected 
British mathematician Alan Turing 
wrote, “I believe that at the end 
of the century, the use of words 
and general educated opinion will 
have altered so much that one 
will be able to speak of machines 
thinking without expecting to be 
contradicted.” 
His prediction did not turn out to 
be correct, but it sparked a con-
troversy that continues today: Can computers think, 
and how would we know if they do? 
Turing described a test of machine intelligence in 
a 1950 paper called Computing Machinery and 
Intelligence. The “Turing Test,” as it is now called, 
is somewhat like a TV game show. In a simplified 
version, it pits a judge against two backstage contes-
tants: a computer and a human. The judge asks each 
contestant a series of questions, which are answered 
in written format or displayed on a screen.
A computer passes the Turing Test if the judge is 
unable to determine which contestant is the computer 
and which contestant is human. According to Turing, 
a computer that can respond as intelligently as a 
human must be intelligent and must be able to think.
Turing’s test of machine intelligence launched the 
study of artificial intelligence (AI), which is now a 
mainstream discipline of computer science. An idea 
that previously existed only in the fantasy worlds of 
science fiction writers, such as Karel Capek, L. Frank 
Baum, and Isaac Asimov, became a legitimate field of 
scientific enquiry.
Computers have competed with humans in domain-
specific showdowns. An IBM computer named Deep 
Blue beat Grand Master Garry Kasparov in a 1997 
chess match. Then in 2011, an AI computer named 
Watson won a combined-point Jeopardy! game, beat-
ing two of the quiz show’s biggest all-time winners. 
Watson had access to four tera-
bytes of data, including the entire 
content of Wikipedia. 
An IBM Web page describes 
Watson’s technology as “an 
a p p l i c a t i o n  o f  a d v a n c e d 
Natural Language Processing, 
Information Retrieval, Knowledge 
Representation and Reasoning, 
and Machine Learning technolo-
gies...” The description continues, 
“At its core, Watson is built on 
IBM’s DeepQA technology for 
hypothesis generation, massive 
evidence gathering, analysis, and 
scoring.”
Beating two Jeopardy! experts does not make 
Watson intelligent, however. Jeopardy! requires con-
testants to answer questions in the form of “Who 
is...” or “What is....” Carrying out a sustained con-
versation, staying on topic, and responding sensibly 
require more sophistication; but that is not to say 
that Watson could not acquire those abilities through 
additional programming and learning. 
Whether or not you believe that computers might 
eventually be able to think, consider Ray Kurzweil’s 
prediction, “By the time the controversy dies down 
and it becomes unambiguous that nonbiological intel-
ligence is equal to biological human intelligence, the 
AIs will already be thousands of times smarter than 
us.” But not to worry. Kurzweil continues, “Ultimately, 
we will vastly extend and expand our own intelligence 
by merging with these tools of our own creation.”

Information Tools: making the cut
Searching Bing, Google Scholar, or academic databases produces mountains of links. How do you select and 
save the most relevant bits of information? The first step is to decide which information is relevant enough to 
make the cut. To decide, ask yourself the following three questions:
1. IS IT RELEVANT? Read the search engine synopsis carefully. With Google and other search engines, 
the synopsis shows your search terms in the context of the article. Academic databases display a standard 
synopsis. Don’t waste your time linking to articles that are not relevant to your research topic.

the pedigree of a scholarly article, check Beall’s List online. 
3. ARE THERE LINKS TO ADDITIONAL MATERIAL? 
The first part of a full-text journal article summarizes historical research and may include lots of citations. 
Some of these ideas might be worth tracking down for your own research. The bibliography can help you 
locate specific material mentioned in the article.
The idea that artificial intelligence and automation create more jobs than they destroy has been 
challenged by Jared Bernstein, Erik Brynjolfsson, Andrew McAfee and others, who, through their 
research, reveal decoupling of productivity and employment. As Brynjolfsson [1] points out...

❍
❍
Use a word processor, a reference management application, or a multimedia tool such as Office Mix.
❍
❍
Be sure to identify information that is not your own. One technique is to put it inside quotation marks; 
another technique is to apply a highlight color.
❍
❍
Always capture the URL of a source document so that you can return to it if you eventually include it in 
your paper and need a full citation.
❍
❍
Make sure that you add your own identifier to each piece of information; use your notes as topic 
headers, which will help you group and organize the information.
❍
❍
Articles most relevant to your research topic require careful reading and note taking. For less relevant 
articles, simply make a note of the main idea and URL, just in case it becomes relevant later in your 
research process.
For more sources, jump to resources 
mentioned in the bibliography.

Technology in Context: Computer Games
The lone programmer who whips 
out a blockbuster video game has become a cul-
tural meme. But can an indie programmer expect 
to author the next Angry Birds or Destiny? Do big 
corporations such as Sony, Activision, and EA have 
a monopoly, or do new mobile app markets allow 
independent developers to keep a foot in the door 
of opportunity?
The computer game industry is on a roll. From 
arcade games to video games, from PCs to mobile 
apps, worlds of colorful candy, blazing weaponry, 
and interstellar travel captivate gamers world-
wide. Global revenue from computer and console 
games was about $46.5 billion in 2014. Sony, one 
of the largest game publishers, generates approxi-
mately $10 billion in revenues each year from its 
PlayStations and worldwide game sales. 
Mobile gaming revenue accounts for another $10 
billion worldwide. In 2014, Candy Crush Saga 
earned $1 billion for developer King. Puzzle & 
Dragons pulled in $1.5 billion. Clash of Clans devel-
oper Supercell reported net revenue of $1.8 billion in 
2014. Wow! Producing a game that generates even 
a small percentage of that revenue would surely be 
a windfall for an enterprising programmer.
The outlook for earning revenue from mobile apps 
is not very bright, however. As of 2014, the Apple 
App Store carried an estimated 800,000 games. 
Many of those games are distributed as freebies or 
under a freemium business model. Forbes maga-
zine reported that the average app developer offers 
five apps and earns less than $4,000 per year, total. 
According to MIDiA Research, nearly 85% of the 
700 top-grossing iPhone and Android apps are 
games, and 81% of the top-grossing apps origi-
nated from just 50 companies. Clearly, independent 
game developers have a difficult time breaking into 
the revenue brackets that rival a day job.
Back in the 1990s, when video games such as 
Mortal Kombat, EverQuest, and Unreal Tournament 
hit the big time, a typical development budget hov-
ered around $3 million. That may seem expensive, 
but the cost of today’s mega games can exceed the 
annual budget for some small countries.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Disney’s game 
development and toy production budget for Infinity 
was about $100 million. Destiny, a first-person 
massively multiplayer shooter game developed by 
Bungie and published by Activision, reportedly had 
a budget of $140 million.
Development budgets include a team of program-
mers and graphic designers, audio technicians, and 
project managers. In addition, budgets encompass 
marketing costs. Games that are based on books or 
movies have to be licensed, and those fees can be 
substantial. 
Some independent developers have successfully 
used crowdsourcing at Web sites such as Kickstarter 
to raise funds. Spicy Horse raised $200,000 to 
extend the development of its action role-playing 
game, Akaneiro. Startup 22cans was able to raise 
more than $800,000 to fund its 22-person develop-
ment team during the production of Godus.
As with other genres of new media, opportunities 
afforded by emerging technologies open the gates 
to a flood of wannabe developers. Getting noticed 
without a substantial marketing budget requires the 
kind of luck that leads to picking a winning lottery 
ticket.
Today, aspiring game developers generally collect 
the necessary educational credentials to get hired 
at a well-staffed game company. There are several 
paths to pursue because game projects require 
team members with a variety of skills.

The terms game developer and game designer are 
sometimes used interchangeably, but within the 
industry they have distinct meanings. Game devel-
opers have a technical orientation, so their focus is 
on coding and testing. They decide how a game is 
built and programmed. In contrast, game designers 
focus on the game storyboard, character develop-
ment, and soundscaping. 
In major game studios, developers and designers 
work in specialized teams to fill these roles. For 
example, a game designer working at a major stu-
dio might be responsible just for the clothing of the 
main characters. A developer at the same studio 
might spend every day creating and testing the logic 
that assigns point totals to characters. 
An alternative development strategy echoes the 
small-team approach used to create early comput-
ers games. Supercell, a 60-employee mobile game 
company based in Finland, organizes developers in 
autonomous groups of five to seven people. Each 
group generates game ideas and develops pro-
totypes that are play-tested by other groups in the 
company. Games that pass the play-test will first 
debut at Canada’s iTunes App Store. Games that 
are successful in this test market are released in the 
U.S., Europe, and Asia. 
So how are blockbuster video games developed? 
The process begins with months of planning and 
preparation. Every game has an underlying story 
that emerges from the creative mind of a writer or 
filmmaker. Games may be based on books, movies, 
or real-world events. Many games are spin-offs or 
sequels of already popular games.
From the story, artists and writers develop a story-
board using sketches and narratives to describe key 
aspects of the game, including characters, worlds, 
scoring, and play levels. Characters emerge from 
rough sketches that are refined by artists using digi-
tal drawing tools. 
Two-dimensional concept drawings are rendered 
into three-dimensional characters beginning with a 
wireframe that gives each character its physique. 
Muscles, skin, clothing, and other features are 
added along with animation points supplied by mod-
els wearing motion capture suits. 
While characters are being developed, other design-
ers are working on the setting. Today’s immersive 
games take place in environments that are rich 
in both visual and auditory details. Game worlds 
are drawn by artists and then rendered into three 
dimensions by programmers. 
Programmers are also responsible for knitting 
together all the game elements. Characters con-
trolled by gamers are programmed to be responsive 
and realistic as they move within the game envi-
ronment. Weapons and objects are programmed 
to obey the laws of physics. Computer-controlled 
opponents have to be guided by artificial intelli-
gence that is just smart enough to be challenging, 
but not too smart to be invincible. 
Jobs for game developers typically require a mini-
mum of a bachelor’s degree, but some employers 
may accept an associate’s degree. Internships help 
prospective developers gain experience that is usu-
ally a requirement for most programming positions.
For aspiring team members who want to work on 
the creative rather than the technical components of 
games, a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with a focus 
on computer game design is an excellent resume 
builder.
Today, there are dedicated courses in computer 
game design that focus on tools and techniques 
for creating games for arcades, computers, and 
mobile devices. The Princeton Review ranked the 
University of Southern California at Los Angeles, 
the University of Utah, and DigiPen as the top three 
undergraduate game development programs based 
on curriculum, faculty, and facilities. 
These schools have fully equipped virtual reality 
studios with Oculus Rift head-mounted displays 
and full-immersion treadmill systems. They also 
have ADR (automatic dialog replacement) rooms for 
recording voice-overs and Foley studios for record-
ing sound effects. Working with motion capture 
suits against a green screen, graphic arts students 
can collect data points for animating game charac-
ters—a technique used by most game companies 
to speed up development. If you’re a student who 
wants to work in the game industry, check it out!

Critical Thinking
Think like a programmer and write a detailed 
description of making a peanut butter sandwich. 
Next, look at your detailed instructions and circle 
any looping or branching activities. If you don’t 
have any, your description wasn’t detailed enough 
and you should rework it. When you’ve completed 
the description, submit it to your instructor, who 
might compare the most and least detailed descrip-
tions submitted by all students in your class.
Group Project
In a group of three students, create the specifica-
tions for a program to operate a gas pump. Make 
sure you create a problem statement, complete 
with assumptions and known information. Design 
the algorithm, making sure it dispenses the cus-
tomer’s choice of Regular, Mid-grade, or Premium 
gas. Assume that all customers will pay cash (credit 
cards are not accepted). Create mockups of the 
input/output displays shown to the customer. Create 
a test plan with a comprehensive set of inputs and 
outputs that could be used to check the accuracy of 
your finished program. You can collaborate on each 
aspect of the specifications or assign one student 
to each. Consolidate your completed specifications 
into a single document to submit to your instructor. 
Cyberclassroom
Apple co-founder Steve Jobs famously said that 
everyone should learn to program “because it 
teaches you how to think.” Discuss this idea with 
a group of your classmates. Do your experiences 
with programming and digital devices validate the 
statement made by Mr. Jobs? Assuming his idea 
has merit, should programming be introduced into 
the curriculum for elementary school, high school, 
or college students?
Multimedia Project
To appreciate the complexity of game program-
ming, play a computer game. Make a list of the 
objects you encounter during the first five minutes 
of the game. You might have to stop and restart the 
game several times to complete your list. Don’t for-
get to include the title screen, introductory music, 
video, and so on. Expand your list of objects by 
adding descriptions of what happens to the objects. 
For example, the background scenery object might 
move when the game character reaches a certain 
point on the screen, or a sound might be emitted 
by a character that gets struck by a weapon. Take 
a screenshot of the game during your observation 
period. Submit your list and screenshot. Indicate 
the name of the game you observed on the screen-
shot.
Resume Builder
The computer game industry is hot and employs 
professionals from a wide variety of career fields. 
How would a professional in your career field fit into 
a computer game development team? What aspect 
of the game would he or she work on? Jot down 
your thoughts, and then go online and search for 
information about computer game development. 
What can you learn about jobs in the computer 
game industry for people with skills in your career 
field? Submit your findings in the format of your 
choice. You can write a one-page summary or get 
creative and develop a brochure or a 30-second 
radio spot.
Globalization
There is a growing trend to develop software that 
can be used globally. Suppose you are supervising 
a programming team, and you have directed them 
to internationalize a software application and make 
sure it can be easily converted into a variety of lan-
guages. After conducting research on the Web, 
create a list of best practices for software globaliza-
tion that you would distribute to your programming 
team.

Interactive Summary
SECTION A:  The instructions for a com-
p u t e r  p r o g r am a re  so me ti me s re fe rred to as 
 . Computer programmers focus 
on 
 computer programs, but they also 
plan, test, and ­document computer programs. In contrast, 
software 
 apply formalized tech-
niques to reduce the cost and complexity of software while 
increasing reliability. Before program code can be written, a 
programmer needs a clear problem 
 , 
which includes a list of assumptions, a description of known 
information, and a specification for what constitutes a solu-
tion. Programming projects can be approached using a(n) 
 methodology, which requires 
extensive planning and documentation up front. An alter-
native approach is to use the 
 
methodology in which programs are developed in itera-
tions called 
 . With a clear plan, 
a programmer can begin coding using a text editor, pro-
gram editor, or 
 development 
environment. Programs are composed of a series of state-
ments that include a(n) 
 such 
as input or print and parameters. Those parameters may 
include 
 that represent values that 
can change, or 
 that represent 
unchanging values. All computer programs should include 
internal documentation in the form of 
  , 
which are explanatory comments inserted into a computer 
program along with lines of code. A program is not com-
plete until it has been tested to ensure that it contains 
no 
 errors, logic errors, or runtime 
errors. Programmers can use 
 meth-
ods based on rigorous logical and mathematical models 
to reduce the number of defects in a software product. 
Additional techniques for producing high-quality, secure 
code include threat modeling and 
 
programming. 
SECTION B: A computer programming language is 
a set of grammar rules and 
 for cre-
ating instructions that can ultimately be processed by a 
computer. The first programming languages were low-level 
 languages. Second-generation lan-
guages, called 
 languages, allowed 
programmers to write programs consisting of abbreviated 
op codes instead of 1s and 0s. Third-generation languages 
provided programmers with easy-to-remember command 
words, such as PRINT and INPUT. Fourth-generation 
languages were designed to eliminate many of the strict 
punctuation and 
 rules that 
complicated third-generation languages. Each generation 
of languages has a higher level of 
 
that removes or hides low-level details. Computer code ulti-
mately must be converted into machine language so that 
it can be executed by the processor. That conversion can 
be performed by a(n) 
 that converts 
 code into 
 
code. Alternatively, a(n) 
 converts 
and executes one line at at time. 
 
languages, such as JavaScript and Perl, are executed one 
line at a time. Programming 
 , such as 
procedural, object-oriented, and declarative, are method-
ologies that affect the way programmers conceptualize and 
approach computer programming. Programming languages, 
such as Java, C++, Swift, and Python, support one or more 
programming approaches. Programming languages can be 
obtained à la carte or in a package of tools such as an SDK 
or 
 development environment. APIs 
also come in handy for adding standard user interface ele-
ments such as menu bars, and functional elements such as 
print routines.

SECTION C: Languages such as COBOL and Fortran 
support a traditional approach to programming called the 
 paradigm, which is based on a step-by-
step 
 . Various planning tools, such as 
structured English, 
 , and flowcharts, 
help programmers plan the steps for a procedural program. 
Procedural languages provide programmers with a variety 
of 
 control structures for specifying the 
order of program execution. A(n) 
 
directs the computer to execute one or more instructions 
not coded as part of the main execution path of a program. 
A(n) 
 control provides a choice of 
paths based on whether a condition is true or false. A(n) 
 control, or loop, repeats one or more 
instructions until a certain condition is met. The procedural 
paradigm provides a solid approach to problems that can 
be solved by following a set of steps. Procedural languages 
tend to produce programs that run quickly and use system 
resources efficiently.
SECTION D: The object-oriented paradigm is based 
on the idea that the solution to a problem can be visual-
ized in terms of objects that 
 with 
each other. An object is a single instance of an entity. 
Programmers can use a class as a template for a group of 
 with similar characteristics. Classes 
can be derived from other classes through a process 
called 
 . The set of superclasses and 
­subclasses that are related to each other is referred to as 
a class 
 . OO programmers often use 
 Modeling Language diagrams to plan 
the classes for a program. 
Objects interact with each other to solve problems by 
exchanging 
 , which initiate an 
action, a process, or a procedure. OO programmers can 
create 
 to define what happens 
once an action is initiated. For flexibility, a concept called 
 , or overloading, allows ­programmers 
to create a single, generic name for a procedure that behaves 
in unique ways for different classes. The OO paradigm allows 
programmers to hide the internal details of objects and their 
methods. This process, called 
 , allows 
objects to be easily reused, modified, and repurposed.
SECTION E: Programming languages such as Prolog 
support the 
 programming para-
digm because they encourage programmers to describe a(n) 
 rather than its solution. Prolog programs 
are typically based upon a collection of facts and rules. A 
Prolog fact begins with a(n) 
 , such as 
shapeof, ­followed by a series of 
 
within parentheses, such as (pizza,round). Each Prolog rule 
has a(n) 
 , which defines an outcome or 
fact, followed by the notation :-, which means “if.” The body of 
the rule consists of one or more clauses that define condi-
tions that must be satisfied to validate the head of the rule. 
Prolog uses a process called 
 to 
evaluate facts and rules to determine whether they are true. 
In Prolog jargon, a question or query to a program’s data-
base is called a(n) 
 . Declarative lan-
guages, such as Prolog, can be used for problems that require 
calculations, but those problems are typically better suited to 
 languages. As a general rule, declara-
tive languages are best ­suited for problems that pertain to 
words and concepts rather than numbers.

THE ORIGINAL ADVENTURE GAME WAS TEXT BASED. Gamers spent hours and hours immersed in a world of 
caves, treasure, riddles, and dangers. In this lab, you’ll get into that retro vibe while designing the gateway to an adven-
ture game. It is a fun way to learn some programming basics and gain appreciation for the programmer’s mind-set.
REQUIREMENTS: 
For this lab, you’ll need a Windows or Apple computer with access to the Internet. The lab requires a Python develop-
ment environment. You can use a locally installed Python IDE, or you can follow the instructions in Step 1 to access a 
free Web-based IDE. The lab instructions are generalized; they provide helpful guidelines, but not specific steps. Work 
carefully; programming requires precision, so type program statements exactly as they are printed. If you encounter 
syntax or runtime errors, look carefully at your code to find the errors.
ASSIGNMENT:
 Search Google for Python online to locate an interac-
tive Python programming environment, such as Repl.it or 
Python fiddle. If the site requires registration, go ahead 
and register. (Hint: Be sure to use Python 3.0 or above. 
The syntax is slightly different from that of Python 1.0 and 
2.0.)
 Enter a comment and a command to output a mes-
sage:
Type # Adventure Game YourName on line 1, substi-
tuting your full name for “YourName.”
Press the Enter key to move down to line 2, and then 
type the following code all on one line:
print ("You are lost underground in a maze 
of tunnels.")
Run your program. (Hint: For Repl.it and Python fiddle, 
select the Run button.)
If you receive an error message, make sure you’ve 
included the parentheses and quotation marks, and then 
try to run the program again.
 Generate a random number.
Your Adventure program must generate a random num-
ber between 1 and 2. The number will not be displayed 
to players, but it will be used to secretly set up the game 
world and put a dragon in one of the tunnels.
The secret number will be stored in a variable that is 
called dangerTunnel.
Add the following statements to your program:
import random
dangerTunnel = random.randint(1,2)
Test your code to make sure you don’t get an error mes-
sage. The output should be “You are lost underground 
in a maze of tunnels.” The screenshot below shows the 
program and output within the Repl.it environment.
When using the Repl.it Python environment, the output of the Adventure program looks like this.

 Unit 11
 Ask players to choose a tunnel.
The next segment of code asks players to select tunnel 1 or tunnel 2. The use of 
int in this statement ensures that the numbers entered by players are stored as 
integers.
Enter the following code all on one line:
tunnelChoice = int(input("Choose tunnel 1 or tunnel 2: "))
 Compare the chosen tunnel to the tunnel that contains a dragon, and then 
tell players if they are safe.
Enter the following code, making sure to indent the two print lines as shown:
print ("You chose tunnel ", tunnelChoice)
if tunnelChoice == dangerTunnel:
    print ("You entered a tunnel with a dragon. Watch out.")
else:
    print ("You entered an empty tunnel. You are safe for now.")
Run the program and debug any syntax errors that might result from missing 
punctuation. 
 Make sure the program does not contain any logic errors.
The program should display the “watch out” message when players select the 
number of the tunnel that contains a dragon. But how do you know if the pro-
gram is doing that? To find out, you can print the number of the dangerTunnel 
just as a test. You can comment it out later if the program is working correctly.
Insert a print statement as line 5, so the program contains the following code:
 1 # Adventure Game Sarah Smith
 2 print ("You are lost underground in a maze of tunnels.")
 3 import random
 4 dangerTunnel = random.randint(1,2)
 5 print ("Dragon in tunnel ", dangerTunnel)
 6 tunnelChoice = int(input("Choose tunnel 1 or tunnel 2: "))
 7 print ("You chose tunnel ", tunnelChoice)
 8 if tunnelChoice == dangerTunnel:
 9     print ("You entered a tunnel with a dragon. Watch out.")
10 else:
11    print ("You entered an empty tunnel. You are safe for now.")
Add this line.

 Test all conditions.
Run the program several times and test each of these conditions:
a. When the dragon is in tunnel 1, do players who enter 1 get the “watch out” 
message?
b. When the dragon is in tunnel 1, do players who enter 2 get the “safe” mes-
sage?
c. When players enter a number that is not 1 or 2, what happens?
 Trap the input so players must enter 1 or 2.
You can use a while loop to check player input. The loop will continue to ask for 
a number until the player enters a 1 or a 2. Insert the following statements as 
lines 6 and 7, and indent line 8 so your code looks like this:
 1 # Adventure Game Sarah Smith
 2  print ("You are lost underground in a maze of tunnels.")
 3 import random
 4 dangerTunnel = random.randint(1,2)
 5 print ("Dragon in tunnel ", dangerTunnel)
 6 tunnelChoice = 0
 7 while tunnelChoice < 1 or tunnelChoice > 2:
 8     tunnelChoice = int(input("Choose tunnel 1 or tunnel 2: "))
 9 print ("You chose tunnel ", tunnelChoice)
10 if tunnelChoice == dangerTunnel:
11     print ("You entered a tunnel with a dragon. Watch out.")
12 else:
13    print ("You entered an empty tunnel. You are safe for now.")
Test your program by entering 5 as the tunnel number. You should be prompted 
to “Choose tunnel 1 or tunnel 2.”
(Hint: If your program goes into an endless loop, use Ctrl-C to stop it.)
 Comment out the print statement that you added for testing by adding a 
hashtag in front of it, like this:
5 # print ("Dragon in tunnel ", dangerTunnel)
 Now, get creative and modify the code to make it your own. You can modify 
the descriptions, add tunnels, allow players to collect treasure, or change the 
dragon into some other form of danger. After testing your adventure game to 
make sure it runs without error, save it or print it out so that you can submit it to 
your instructor.
