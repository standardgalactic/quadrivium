Preface
Preface
The book covers sub-bituminous coal utilisation at this point in time, a decade and a half into the 21st 
Century. Coals of all ranks are experiencing ‘unpopularity’ because of carbon dioxide emissions. That 
issue is given its due place in the book, which after an introduction to the origin and nature of sub-
bituminous coals gives an account of several scenes of power generation from them. Other aspects 
covered include gasification, briquetting and liquefaction. It is intended that a reader of the book will 
achieve both scientific knowledge of all of these topics and an awareness of their role in world energy 
supply. Perhaps he or she will be bold enough to attempt to glimpse into the future and to predict the 
degree to which sub-bituminous coals will contribute to world energy needs in the mid 21st Century at 
which time, it is hoped, carbon dioxide emissions will clearly be on a path towards the 2100 Kyoto targets.

sub-bituminous coals
1.1	
Introduction
Such coals are in between lignites (brown coal) and bituminous coals in the coalification series, numerous 
accounts of which are in the literature including one by the present author [1]. Degree of development 
along the coalification series is the most important factor in determining the nature of a coal as it is 
this which fixes its rank. Accordingly geological age will be the first feature of sub-bituminous coals to 
be discussed. 
1.2	
Geological age
Table 1.2 gives geological ages of a number of sub-bituminous coals from diverse sources, and discussion 
follows. The terms given in the literature sources drawn on are in inverted commas, with explanatory 
details following. Precise definitions of the various geological time spans differ between sources.

The Colombian coals in the first row of the table are from the Amagá formation, which in recent years 
has had an indifferent safety record [5]. Callide coal is mined at an open cut by Anglo American. The 
power plant there uses supercritical steam (see Chapter 2). In the mid 20th Century Callide coal was used 
to a small degree in steam locomotives, comprising 3% of the coal used by the Queensland Railways at 
that time [8]. The same source records that some Collie coal was held in Victoria, southern Australia, for 
contingencies when the brown coal production there was insufficient for the huge electricity generation 
role which it played. 
Walloon coals have been considered for coal seam gas production. It was once believed that Jurassic coals 
were too immature to be abundant methane producers, and this has been challenged with Walloon as an 
example [10]. Coal from Huntly (following row) is also being examined as a source of methane. Huntly 
is in the Waikato coal fields, more fully discussed in Chapter 2. The coal from the Healy formation (next 
row) is used in power generation [15]. In Plate 1.1 below the coal reserve and the power plant (bottom 
right) at Healy are shown in co-existence with wind turbines indicated with an arrow.

Background on the nature of sub-bituminous coals
Collie coal (row 7) is also used to make electricity [20]. Coals of ranks other than sub-bituminous are 
produced in Alberta (next row), where there are nine coal mines in all. The rank of a coal is evaluated by 
standards, notably ASTM D388 – 12 ‘Standard Classification of Coals by Rank’. A coal can be at a state 
of maturity such that assignment of a single rank is impossible and the Turkish coal in the next row of 
the table is a case in point, being described in reference [23] as being ‘in a transition’ between lignite 
and sub-bituminous. The deposit at Mukah Balingian in Malaysia (final row) exists in a quantity of 550 
million tonnes and has been noted for its potential to provide energy for that region of the world [28]. 
It is a fairly elementary calculation to show that that amount could raise 1000 TW-hour of electricity, 
seven to eight times the current annual electricity production for the whole of Malaysia [29]. Across 
a range of nine samples from Nigeria (next row) the proportion of vitrinite varied from 63 to 80%. 
Vitrinite reflectances at ≈ 0.5 to 0.6% were consistent with the sub-bituminous classification. The Chinese 
sub-bituminous coal in the next row co-exists with oil shale, which is extracted. The Bulgarian coal is 
up to 97% in the vitrinite group of macerals and are high in sulphur, up to almost 12%. The deposit in 
India in the following row contains sub-bituminous and high-volatile bituminous as does the Miocene 
deposit in Venezuela. The coal deposit crossing the NSW/Queensland border in the following row also 
contains high-volatile bituminous as well as sub-bituminous. The range in rank is evident from the range 
of vitrinite reflectances, from 0.45 to 0.71%. The deposit in Sarawak in the next row contains lignite and 
sub-bituminous coal with vitrinite reflectances in the range 0.26%–0.39%. 
The most striking point emerging from the table is the huge range of ages of the sub-bituminous coals, 
from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years. This reflects a terminological difficulty when coal 
rank is seen as a measure of coal age, which it is not. That is because advance along the coalification series 
requires factors additional to time [40]. These factors relate to conditions of coalification including depth 
and temperature. Heat flux received by a deposit will not be constant or steady over the coalification time. 
Both its duration and the maximum temperature experienced by the deposit are factors determining 
the ultimate rank.

Petrographic composition
Each of the coals having made an appearance in Table 1.1 will be discussed in terms of petrography. A 
further study of that from the Amagá formation in Colombia uses huminite rather than vitrinite in its 
maceral classification [41]. This is more common for lignites than for sub-bituminous coals. Coal from 
the Callide Basin in Australia had a preponderance of intertinite, and a vitrinite reflectance of 0.53. That 
from Walloon is 75% vitrinite with a similarly low reflectance indicative of sub-bituminous rank. Coals 
from the Huntly field in New Zealand have vitrinite reflectances in the range 0.34 to 0.53% [42]. They are 
also rich in vitrinite and fit the description ‘bright coal’, a term which applies to coals 80% or higher in 
vitrinite and displaying bands of vitrain [43], which Huntly coal does. The sub-bituminous coal formation 
from the Healy formation in Alaska is lenticular, suggesting ingress into an inorganic formation of water 
bearing plant debris. On this hypothesis it is also therefore allochthonous. Sub-bituminous coals from 
Indonesia had vitrinite reflectances up to 0.42%. By way of comparison, an anthracite from Papua in 
the same study had a vitrinite reflectance of 4.94%.

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview
15 
Background on the nature of sub-bituminous coals
Continuing with coals from Table 1.1, the sub-bituminous coal from Collie in WA has macerals from the 
vitrinite and inertinite groups as its major petrographic constituents, with little liptinite [44]. One seam 
within the central Alberta sub-bituminous coal reserve contains epigenetic pyrite [45], that is pyrite not 
initially a mineral external to the coal but formed within the coalifying mass by ingress of water containing 
iron as a solute. The coal from Meghalaya in India displays marked lithotypes (banded structure) and is 
very high in vitrinite. The Turkish coal has vitrinite reflectances in the range 0.38 to 0.54%. The fact that 
it is Miocene is consistent with its transitional state as noted: many lignites are Miocene. The Uzbekistan 
sub-bituminous coal referred to has a vitrinite reflectance of 0.5%. With reference to the coal from BC in 
the following row, Oligocene is also within the Cenozoic Era. The deposit contains lignite (of huminite 
reflectance 0.38) and sub-bituminous coal (of huminite reflectance 0.5). The pay of this deposit ranges 
from 350 m to 550 m in thickness, making it one of the major sub-bituminous reserves of the world. 
1.4	
Moisture content
Many lignites in the bed-moist state are over 50% moisture by weight. It is stated in [46], where a 
Canadian sub-bituminous coal was of particular interest, that sub-bituminous coals as mined are often 
as low as 1 to 6% in moisture. To that is added the fact that some cleaning procedures raise this by as 
much as 25%. The Powder River Basin in Wyoming is the most important sub-bituminous coal deposit 
in the world, and therefore has major coverage later in this book. Powder River coal is used on a large 
scale for electricity generation, and moisture of course involves reduction of calorific value on a simple 
weight basis. Wyodak is one area within Powder River, and a Wyodak coal is reported as having 29.2% 
moisture as received in a programme of work into trace element emissions from combustion [47].
From the above it is clear that there can be major amounts of water in sub-bituminous coals and that 
this is an issue in utilisation. Consequently drying is often required and there are investigations into 
news means of drying. The major benefit to be expected from drying is expressed by calorific values of 
19.3 to 28.0 MJ kg-1 for a US sub-bituminous coal in respectively wet and dry states [48].

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview
16 
Background on the nature of sub-bituminous coals
Reference [46] is concerned with microwave drying of coal from Highvale, Alberta (see Table 1.4 et seq.). 
Conditions were up to 800 W of power at a frequency of 2.45 GHz. The coal was tested in pelletised 
form and heating rates were 3°C per minute up to a ceiling of 650°C. The plot showing the rate of 
microwave drying of 30 g of the Highvale coal vis-à-vis conventional drying is striking, displaying total 
drying under microwave application in time of the order of 200s. Conventional drying can never be 
total except in the hypothetical limit where it is done under conditions of zero humidity; the moisture 
in the coal will always equilibrate with that of the atmosphere, giving a non-zero result. The curve in 
[46] for conventional drying declines to about 10% moisture after time of the order of two hours. This 
is for convective conditions of drying. In terms of thermodynamics the situation is not simple. Water 
in macropores in the coal might be treated as if it were simply in a container and sustained convention 
with dry air expected to remove it. In reality as well as the coal in the smaller (meso- and micro-) pores 
there is some imbibed in the cross-linked structure of the coal. This the microwaves can remove but not, 
except under much more vigorous conditions than would be normal, convective drying. 
1.5	
Calorific values
This topic has been anticipated above in the values given for a US sub-bituminous coal and comments 
thereon. The mean value across 277 samples of the calorific value of Powder River coal is given in [49] 
as 8220 BTU per lb ≡ 19.2 MJ kg-1. The mean ash content was 6.4%, making the calorific value on an 
ash-free basis 20.5 MJ kg-1. A value of 18.22 MJ kg-1 has been reported for Collie coal [50] and the 
same source gives the same value for the recently discovered sub-bituminous coal at Talisker, also in 
Western Australia.
1.6	
Other properties
The Hardgrove index, a measure of grindability, has been reported for Collie coals from four seams 
[51], and for blends of coals from the different seams. Values in the range 48 to 57 were reported for 
air dried coals. Values were a few percent lower for oven dried coals. (The higher the Hardgrove index 
the greater the grindability.) Sometimes a value of 50 is seen as that above which grinding will not be 
the rate-determining step in supply of coal in pulverised form to a furnace [52]. Table 1.3 below gives 
Hardgrove Indices for a selection of sub-bituminous coals. 
Table 1.3 below gives details of some other Hardgrove indices for sub-bituminous coals.

Table 1.3. Hardgrove indices of selected sub-bituminous coals.
In the work in the first row of the table, the Hardgrove index of the coal was compared with those of 
biomass pellets seen as substitutes for carbon mitigation purposes. These (which included Miscanthus) 
gave values in the range 14–29. In the work on Collie coals, experiments were conducted whereby 
different times were allowed for air drying of raw samples before testing for grindability. There was some 
randomness of behaviour, and for five different coals from Collie across a moisture content range of 17 
to 22% the Hardgrove Indices, on a very scattered plot, varied in the range 46–59. It is noted for the 
Kalimantan coal [55] that the Hardgrove Index range signifies resistance to grinding. The value given 
as a typical one for Alaskan sub-bituminous coals is also on the low side. 
A Wyodak sub-bituminous coal is reported as having a BET surface area of 50 m2g-1 [57]. These and other 
properties of sub-bituminous coals will be examined for particular examples at later stages of the book.

Background on the nature of sub-bituminous coals
1.7	
Sapropelic coals equivalent to sub-bituminous in rank
A sapropelic coal, in contrast to a humic coal, originates not from peat but from sapropel. Sapropel is 
formed from freshwater life on a time scale of thousands of years. Like humic coals, sapropelic coals 
advance along a coalification sequence, and examples of sapropelic brown coals are many. There are also 
sapropelic sub-bituminous coals called ‘black cannel coal’ [58] or as ‘black subcannel coal’ [59].
An example of occurrence of black subcannel coal, the sapropelic analogue of sub-bituminous coal, is 
the Colob coal field in Utah [56] where, subcannel coal co-exists with sub-bituminous coal. The bed 
of black subcannel coal is in a bed of thickness 1.7 m, beneath a sub-bituminous coal layer about half 
that thickness.
1.8	
Application of Hilt’s Law
Hilt’s Law states [60]:
In a vertical sequence at one locality in a coal field the rank of the coal rises with greater depth and the 
effect is clearly related to the thermal gradient [56]. Returning to the coal deposit at Hat Creek which, 
as noted, is one of the major sub-bituminous coal reserves of the world, the lignite is on top of the sub-
bituminous. For it to have been the other way round would not only have been in contravention of Hilt’s 
Law but also counterintuitive in the extreme. Nevertheless contraventions are not unknown, for example 
in Great Britain where decrease in rank with depth has frequently been reported at certain sites within 
coal fields [61]. A clue can be found by considering the heterogeneity of a deposition in which layers of 
vegetation undergoing coalification are interspersed with minerals, and the variation in such quantities 
as thermal conductivities and specific heats which are relevant to the action of the thermal gradient. 
Hilt’s Law can be tested more precisely by examining vitrinite reflectance as a function of depth within 
a coal seam.

A generalised value of the ash content of PRB coals

actinide series (e.g. thorium) and in the lanthanide 
series (e.g. cerium) are identified in PRB coal ash.

Table 1.4. Ash-forming constituents.
Other elements found in the PRB coal ash included uranium and plutonium (actinides), and Europium 
and Ytterbium (lanthanides). The Wara mine is only 5 km from the Tutupan mine, also yielding coal for 
power generation, where the coal is bituminous in rank. The Highvale coal has the additional advantage 
of being only moderate in sulphur. It was mentioned previously in this chapter that Collie coal is used to 
make electricity. It is burnt as pulverised fuel and the flyash is used in the manufacture of concrete. The 
work described in [66] (next row) originates in Italy, and the coal was obtained from an ENEL2 power 
plant which uses sub-bituminous coal imported from Indonesia. The work in [67] is focused on the 
highly classical procedures for reducing the ash content of a coal by flotation. In summary, if sufficiently 
broken up a coal will behave in an aqueous medium of pre-calculated specific gravity in such a way that 
coals very high in minerals sink, coals low in minerals float and there are ‘middlings’. It is claimed in 
[67] that coal of 26.6% ash can be obtained at 66.5% yield from the coal initially over 40% ash. Wyodak 
(following row) is part of PRB, and it is encouraging to note that the value given for the ash content of 
the Wyodak coal is comfortably within the range of ash contents for PRB coals generally given in row 1.

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview
20 
Background on the nature of sub-bituminous coals
Coal from the ENEL plant was the basis of a study involving co-firing with biomass for carbon mitigation 
purposes [69]. The biomass chosen was cellulosic ethanol residue (CER), which is what remains when 
lignocellulosics are broken down into sugars for fermentation. Small samples of blends of this and the 
Indonesian coal used at ENEL were heat in a thermal analysis unit under a flowing air atmosphere. 
The temperature corresponding to the maximum weight loss, called the combustion index, did not 
as might have been expected intuitively increase linearly with the proportion of biomass in the blend. 
Up to about 20% CER this temperature is fairly steady at about 100°C rising to around 500°C at 100% 
CER. The ignition temperature is defined as the temperature at which, after moisture loss, the rate mass 
loss reaches 1% per minute and was 300°C for the coal only dropping monotonically to about 250°C 
for the CER only. The burnout temperature is defined as that at which, on the declining part of a DTG 
curve, the mass loss rate returns to 1% per minute. This was about 540°C for the Indonesian coal only, 
dropping monotonically to a little above 400°C for the CER only. Activation energies were determined 
numerically from the thermal analysis traces at various degrees of extent of conversion to combustion 
products (α). They showed a marked decrease with α across the range 0.2 to 0.8, with an average 44.9 kJ 
mol-1 for the coal and 76.6 kJ mol1 for the CER. Up to 20% CER – the highest proportion used – the 
value is dominated by that for the coal being respectively 44.3, 46.0, 48.6 and 41.1 kJ mol-1 5%, 10%, 15% 
and 20% CER. These data are seen as providing input to co-firing in a boiler furnace, very common in 
meeting carbon dioxide reduction targets. The ultimate is of course biomass only, as has happened at 
the huge Drax power station in England which uses bituminous coal. The CER if just dumped would, as 
well as being a spontaneous heating hazard, over a time of the order of years decompose, with methane 
in the products. This is of course a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. There is major 
‘cellulosic ethanol’ production in Italy (its destination being petroleum blends) so this resource would 
be plentiful and cheap as a fuel for power generation. 
1.10	
Concluding remarks
This chapter can hopefully be drawn on when such things as power generation from sub-bituminous 
coals and gasification of them are discussed in the subsequent chapters. We finish the chapter with 
mention of the term ‘semi-bituminous coal’ The term was coined in relation to Pennsylvania coals in 
1877 [70] as part of a classification based on the ratio of fixed carbon to volatile matter, called the ‘fuel 
ratio’. On this basis a bituminous coal has a fuel ratio of up to 5, a semi-bituminous coal a fuel ratio of 
5 to 8, a semi-anthracite a fuel ratio of 8 to 12 and an anthracite a fuel ratio of 8 to 100 [71]. Clearly a 
semi-bituminous coal is a low-volatile bituminous in today’s terminology and is in no way synonymous 
with sub-bituminous, which has a boundary with high-volatile bituminous. The term was widely used 
in Britain well into the 20th Century (e.g. [72]) with the same meaning.

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview

Utilisation in power generation
2	 Utilisation in power generation
2.1	
Introduction
With coals of all rank, power generation is the most important outlet for utilisation. This chapter will 
therefore cover some major scenes of power generation from sub-bituminous coals on a geographical basis.
2.2	
Australia
2.2.1	
Callide
Callide coal was introduced in the previous chapter. There are three units: Callide A (120 MW, 
commencing operations 1965), Callide B (700 MW) and Callide C (810 MW) [1]. The total capacity 
then is 1630 MW. Only unit C uses supercritical steam at this time. Plate 2.1 shows Callide power station.
Plate 2.1. Callide power station, Queensland. Image taken from:  
http://www.travelling-australia.info/MainGraphics2004/P045050068Bz-750.jpg
Oxyfuel combustion is under development at Callide [2]. In Oxyfuel combustion burning is in oxygen, 
making the carbon dioxide more concentrated than in flue gases from air-fuel processes and therefore 
easier to sequestrate. Callide is in the Bowen Basin, where it is known that some sapropelic materials 
(see section 1.7) exists [3].

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview
28 
Utilisation in power generation
It was noted in the previous chapter that Callide coal was once considered as a standby fuel for electricity 
generation in Victoria, where locally mined soft brown coal is used. It would have been a suitable substitute 
for brown coal briquettes for use in start-up, having a calorific value and a hardness comparable to 
those. The distance from Callide to Melbourne is about 1200 miles yet Callide coal rather than NSW 
bituminous coal was considered as a contingency fuel. The latter would have been too different from 
briquetted Victorian brown coal to be used in the power plants of Victoria, and here is an interesting 
example of the importance of coal rank. A sub-bituminous coal was suitable as a substitute for a lignite 
under certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, but not a bituminous coal. The daily 
newspaper ‘The Morning Bulletin’ reported in November 1949 that when Callide coal was first evaluated 
for use in power generation its price had to be compared on a heat basis with that of imported coal.
2.2.2	
Collie
This also was described in the previous chapter. The power station there commenced service in 1999, 
and its nameplate capacity is 340 MW. There is activity into geosequestration of carbon dioxide from 
Collie and from four other power stations in Western Australia in the South West Hub CCS scheme [4, 
5]. The other power stations are Kwinana (420MW from coal, oil and natural gas [6]), Wagerup (380 
MW from gas and petroleum distillate [7]), Mandurah (1.4 MW from waste fuels [8]) and Pinjarra (285 
MW from natural gas [9]). 
Carbon dioxide for sequestration at South West Hub will be in the supercritical state and will enter a 
saline sandstone aquifer. The critical constants for carbon dioxide are 31.1°C and 73.8 bar (7.38 MPa) 
[10]. Now the pressure converts to a value in metres of water of:
7.38 × 106 Pa (=N m-2)/(9.81 m s-2 × 1000 kg m-3) = 752 m
and this is the basis of the rule-of-thumb that aquifer sequestration of carbon dioxide requires depths of 
800 m or greater. At the South West Hub trials have been at a depth of 2945 m. The pressure at the base 
of a column of water of this height would be 29 MPa (290 bar). The phase diagram for carbon dioxide 
is reproduced in an appendix to this chapter, and from it it is clear that this pressure would maintain 
supercriticality. Further comments are in the appendix.
2.3	
Alberta
The Wabamun power plant in Edmonton has ceased production after 54 years of service [11] and 
decommissioning is under way. Wabamum coal, which supplied the now defunct facility, is early 
Paleocene [12], of the order of 55 million Ma, a division of the Tertiary period (see Table 1.1). The coal 
is rich in huminite and displays lithotypes.

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview
29 
Utilisation in power generation
The Genesee power station south west of Edmonton is supplied with sub-bituminous coal from a mine of 
the same name [13]. Its capacity is 1200 MW from three equivalent steam turbines. The coal as supplied 
has a calorific value of 17.2 MJ kg-1. The Keephills power plant in Alberta also uses sub-bituminous coal, 
from the Highvale mine [14]. Across three units it has a nameplate capacity of 1250 MW. Coal from 
Highvale also goes to the Sundance power station [15]. Having developed in stages since it came into 
operation in 2009, Sundance now has a capacity of 165 MW3. 
2.4	
Indonesia
At the Paiton power station complex in East Java a unit (‘Paiton III’) came into operation in 2012 which 
uses sub-bituminous coal from Kalimantan4 and has supercritical steam [16]. Its capacity is 815 MW. 
Paiton III uses 400 tons (363 tonnes) of coal per hour [17], a figure which is examined in the shaded 
area below.
Using a value of 18 MJ kg-1 for the calorific value (see section 1.5) and, having regard to the use 
of supercritical steam, an efficiency of 0.43, the expected rate of power production is:
{[363 × 103 kg hour-1/(3600 s hour-1)] × 18 × 106 J kg-1 × 0.43 × 10-6} MW = 780 MW.
This is 4% below the nameplate capacity, so the figures hang together.
Paiton III is the first power plant in Indonesia to use supercritical steam.

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview

Utilisation in power generation
Also in Kalimantan is the Adaro coal mine, the product of which is sub-bituminous [18]. Production 
in 2013 was 52.3 million tonnes. Plate 2.2 below shows Adaro coal.

An agreement was recently made [19] whereby Adaro coal is supplied to an electricity producer in 
Kalimantan5 in a quantity sufficient for generation at 200 MW. Adaro coal has the benefit of being low 
in sulphur. It is also low in nitrogen, an advantage since NOx emissions from coal-fired plants do have 
to be controlled. At the temperature of coal combustion, fuel NOx – that from the fuel’s own nitrogen 
content – is expected to dominate to the exclusion of thermal NOx which arises, of course, from nitrogen 
in the air supporting the combustion. Temperatures for thermal NOx are higher than those expected 
from combustion of a coal, especially a lower rank coal. Thermal NOx is more of a problem with natural 
gas combustion or fuel oil combustion. 
Adaro sub-bituminous coal has been imported into Israel, and a study there [20] investigated its firing in 
a boiler furnace originally designed for bituminous coal. Performance advantages of the sub-bituminous 
coal over the bituminous previously used were perceived, including lower NOx, SO2 and ash. These of 
course reflect the properties of the particular sub-bituminous and bituminous coals being compared, 
and the obvious general trend expected from such a substitution was observed: lowering of heat output, 
therefore of steam and of electricity produced. Often at a power station only some of the complement 
of pulverisers (see section 1.6) installed will be in use at any one time, and withdrawal from service of 
one of them for maintenance or repair will not cause disruption to supply. The experience in Israel was 
that all of the pulverisers had to be used to sustain the thermal output, a further disadvantage arising 
from the substitution.

New Zealand
Decommissioned in 1991, the Meremere power station used sub-bituminous coal from the Waikato coal 
fields. Samples of coal from there have been characterised [21] and vary in appearance from bright to 
dull. Some samples are banded whilst others are not. 
Three other quantities were determined for this coal: the axial and diametric point loads and in anisotropic 
index. Having units MPa, point loads are frequently determined for minerals. Their determination [22] 
involves application of a load, and the load sufficient to cause breakage is recorded. If the diametric value 
is required a sample of length-to-diameter ratio > 1.0 is used. If the axial value is required a sample of 
length-to-diameter ratio in the range 0.3 to 1.0 is used. In either case the load in units of force is divided 
by the square of the distance between the clamping points on the tester device which transmit the force 
to the sample, to give a quantity having units MPa. Waikato sub-bituminous coal by this means gave an 
axial value of 1.05 MPa and a diametric value of 0.49 MPa. This was compared in [21] with values for 
materials from the same deposit mainly inorganic in composition. For example, sandstones from the 
deposit gave axial values in the range 0.79 to 1.27 MPa and diametric values in the range 0.30 to 0.85 
MPa. The anisotropic index is simply the axial value divided by the diametric, calculable for the coal as 
2.1, the value which is given in [21].
Clearly this point load is a measure of compressive strength and broadly identifiable with it. Close 
comparisons might require knowledge of conditions and conventions in determinations, which is why 
standards such as ASTM C349 – 14 are used [23]. Even so one is probably justified in comparing the 
point load values for the New Zealand sub-bituminous coal with the compressive strength of a Chinese 
anthracite reported in [24]. This has a compressive strength, depending on the direction of the applied 
force, in the range 22 to 50 MPa, one and a half orders of magnitude higher than the point load of the 
New Zealand sub-bituminous coal. (See also Table 9.1 for details of the Buller field in New Zealand.)
2.6	
Spain
The sub-bituminous coal of Teruel is used in electricity generation at the power plant of the same name, 
where it is blended with bituminous coal [25]. The capacity of the power station across several units 
is 1075 MW. Teruel coal, which is Early Cretaceous, has the disadvantage of being high in sulphur: six 
samples from different parts of the Teruel mining zone when examined [26] had sulphur contents in 
the range 6.0 to 14.9% [25]. Vitrinite reflectances were in the range 0.53 to 0.76%. Coals at the high end 
of the sulphur content range are avoided in utilisation and there is flue gas desulphurisation at Teruel 
power station. The high sulphur is due to there having been gypsum (CaSO4) in the deposit. In general, 
sulphates can be reduced to sulphur in lower oxidation states including H2S in the coalification milieu. 
This in turn can react with the organic material originating from the vegetation to form organic sulphur 
structures analogous to thiols. If iron is present amongst the inorganics pyrite (FeS2) can be formed from 
sulphur having initially been in sulphate form.

South west USA
The Cholla power plant in Arizona uses sub-bituminous coal from the McKinley mine in New Mexico, as 
well as some bituminous coal [28]. Its installed capacity is 995 MW across four non-equivalent units [29]. 
Sub-bituminous coal is also used at the following power plants in Arizona and New Mexico: Apache AZ 
(506 MW from a mix of sub-bituminous coal and natural gas), Coronado AZ (810 MW), Four Corners 
AZ (2040 MW), San Juan NM (1808 MW) and Springerville AZ (1750 MW). The largest then is Four 
Corners, which obtains its coal from the Navajo Mine. That part of Arizona is called Black Mesa, and it 
was noted over a century ago that the coal there is Cretaceous [30]. 
The San Juan power plant receives coal from a mine of the same name, of which it uses 6 million tons 
(5.4 million tonnes) per year [31]. Parts of the San Juan reserve contain coal having ascended in rank 
to bituminous [32]. Springervale obtains its coal from North Antelope Rochelle Mine, which is within 
the Powder River Basin (PRB). PRB coal is the subject of a later chapter. Coronado obtains coal partly 
from PRB and partly from McKinley [33]. The Apache power plant burns partly PRB coal and partly 
coal from Lee Ranch in New Mexico, both sub-bituminous [34]. Annual production at Lee Ranch is 
5358749 short tons (4.86 million tonnes), and it is operated by Peabody. Navajo power station, also in 
Arizona, uses not sub-bituminous coal but bituminous, sourced at the local Kayenta mine [35].

Utilisation in power generation
The Taichung Power Plant (first row) is the largest coal-fired power plant in the world. The Troitskaya 
power station, which is close to the border between Russia and Kazakhstan, uses supercritical steam as 
does the Malaysian facility in the next row. In Thailand (following row) import from Indonesia of sub-
bituminous coal for power generation is expected to increase, and new power plants are to be sited near 
the sea for ease of transfer of coal. By row five of the table, the trend whereby Asian countries import 
sub-bituminous coals from Indonesia is becoming very clear. Such countries have organised themselves 
into the Asian Sub-bituminous Coal Users’ Group, and this met in Bangkok in October 20157. It was 
first set up by CLP Power Hong Kong, who operate Castle Peak. Similarly the South Korean entry in the 
following row features imported Indonesian coal. The Łagisza Power Plant in Poland has a circulating 
fluidised bed similar to the one at Samcheok [42]. It uses bituminous coal, although in the costing this 
was compared with Indonesian sub-bituminous coal. The Indonesian coal was assigned a calorific value 
of 20.6 MJ kg-1 in the study, and the bituminous a value of 25.2 MJ kg-1. The power plant at Odissa uses 
coal from the Talcher field, where there is bituminous coal as well as sub-bituminous8. The Santa Maria 
power plant in Chile came into service only in 2012, and local sub-bituminous coal has been compared for 
performance with bituminous. The Tanjang power station in the following row burns either bituminous 
coal or bituminous blended with up to 30% of sub-bituminous.
Eraring (next row) is exceptional amongst the coal-fired power plants of NSW in that it uses sub-
bituminous coal, not bituminous. Myuna is in the Sydney basin, where most of the coal is bituminous. 
Some coal from the Rio Turbo mine (row 13) is used at the San Nicolas power plant in Buenos Aires. 
San Nicolas also uses fuel oil and natural gas. Rio Turbio is a new facility.
Japan uses coals – sub-bituminous and other ranks – in power stations. One would not imagine total 
reliance on coal as Japan is very heavily capitalised with oil refineries, residual material from which 
will provide for some power generation. An example of a power station in Japan using sub-bituminous 
coal is the Hitachinaka Thermal Power Station, belonging to the Tokyo Electric Power Company [53]. 
It comprises two units, as shown in the plate on the following page. Unit 2 only uses sub-bituminous 
coal in a 50% blend with bituminous, unit 1 a 30% blend. Expansion of the power station from one 
unit to two was a contingency measure after the 2011 earthquake. It is pointed out in [53] that 50% is 
a very high proportion of sub-bituminous coal in a blend with bituminous for power generation: 25% 
sub-bituminous is in general more common in such blends [54].
Both units at Hitachinaka produce 1000 MW of electricity, with 2870 tonne per hour of steam in turbine 
entry, and steam in the condition 250 bar and 600°C. From [55] the specific enthalpy of steam in this 
state can be found as 3493.5 kJ kg-1. In the limit where on turbine exit the the fluid is liquid water at 
30°C its enthalpy is 314 kJ kg-1. These figures are examined below.

The heat in per second is then:
(2870 × 103/3600) kg s-1 × (3493.5 – 125.7) kJ kg-1 × 10-3 × MJ kJ-1 = 2684 MJ.
The efficiency is then:
(1000/2684) × 100% = 37%
The above is reasonable though on the low side for steam in such condition, and the potential source 
of error is the assumption of the fluid condition on turbine exit. This point will be examined. Imagine 
that the fluid on exit is not liquid water not at 30°C but at 60°C. The specific enthalpy of the exit fluid 
is then, from steam tables:
(2870 × 103/3600) kg s-1 × (3493.5 – 251.2) kJ kg-1 × 10-3 × MJ kJ-1 = 2584 MJ
and the efficiency becomes 39%. Also to be considered are turbine details, including whether there is 
re-heating.
 It has been noted [56] that Japan has recently bought less Australian bituminous coal and more Indonesian 
sub-bituminous.

Flyash (a.k.a. Pulverised fuel ash)
In electricity generation using coal as pulverised fuel it is intended that the ash will be conveyed as 
particles of micron size or smaller with the flue gas for removal by electrostatic precipitation. If the 
ash shows a propensity to fusion this might not be so, the ash instead consolidating and depositing on 
surfaces. A high ash fusion temperature is therefore as plus for a coal intended for this application and 
the ash fusion temperature can be resolved into softening temperature (a self-explanatory term) and 
hemisphere temperature (the temperature at which the surface tension of the molten ash causes it to 
have a hemispherical shape). Ash fusion temperatures for a New Zealand sub-bituminous coal have been 
reported. In oxidising atmospheres and without any pre-treatment of the ash, the softening temperatures 
and hemisphere temperatures were in the range respectively 1150 to 1280°C and 1170 to 1300°C. 
Ash fusion temperature information for a number of other sub-bituminous coals is given in Table 2.2 below.

Appendix to Chapter 2 
Phase diagram for carbon dioxide, showing the supercritical region.
Additionally to the content of section 2.2.2 of the main text the following should be noted. The boundary 
for the supercritical state is almost vertical, indicating that the temperature must be maintained at or 
above the critical temperature of 31.1°C for the carbon dioxide to remain in the supercritical region of 
the phase diagram. This is provided for by the natural thermal gradient of the earth’s crust, which in 
addressing this issue specifically is given in the work cited below as 25°C per 1000 m depth. The 2950 
m depth of the well at South West Hub would on this basis provide for a temperature 74°C above the 
surface temperature, or an actual temperature of 74°C for outside conditions at freezing. That would 
ensure maintenance of supercritical conditions. 
The above figure for the temperature gradient within the earth is perfectly general. The source drawn 
on was chosen because it is an application to supercritical carbon dioxide. 
The model for aquifer pressure invoked here – treating it as a column of water of height equivalent to 
the aquifer depth – requires good hydraulic connectivity between the surface water and the aquifer [1].

highly supecritical’. Nevertheless the term is used in power genetration and use of ultra-supercritical 
steam requires construction materials capable of withstanding the conditions. Ultra-supercritical plants 
are by now fiarly common with lignite-fired power generation, less so with sub-bituminous. An example 
of a sub-bituminous power plant using ultra supecritical steam is one in south east USA [2]. 
In Chapter 9 sub-bituminous coal in Vietnam is discussed. Mitsubishi Research Institute in a pdf 
document accessible online present figures for proposed ultra-supercritical power generation with this 
and aim at 44.5% efficiency with steam at 24.5 MPa (245 bar) at 600oC. A reader can easily ascertain 
that that is outside the co-ordinates of the phase diagram above, justifying ‘ultra’!

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview

Powder River Basin coals
3	 Powder River Basin coals
3.1	
Introduction
The Powder River Basin (PRB) crosses the state border between Wyoming and Montana. Plate 3.1. below 
shows the location of PRB and also shows the destinations on the domestic market of coal produced there.
Plate 3.1. Map showing PRB and sales destinations of coal therefrom. Image taken from [1].
PRB occupies an area of over 61000 square kilometres [1]. Production in 2012 was 462 million short 
tons (419 million tonnes) of sub-bituminous coal [2]. The coal, which is low in sulphur, accounts for 
40% of the total coal production of the US. 
3.2	
Characteristics of PRB coal
The coal is sub-bituminous as noted10. The calorific value of PRB sub-bituminous coal is given in [3] 
as 8683 BTU lb-1 ≡ 20.3 MJ kg-1. Its analysis figures on a dry basis are moisture 23.8%, ash11 6.6% and 
sulphur 0.4%. Not only is the sulphur low, but the inorganic content is high in calcium oxides and this 
enables such sulphur oxides as are formed in combustion to be trapped in the ash. A Hardrove Index 
for PRB coal of 60 has been reported [4]. 
3.3	
Mines at PRB
There are sixteen such, and they include the Calabo mine near Gillette in Campbell County WY, which 
is operated by Peabody [5]. Production there in 2013 was 9 million short tons (8.2 million tonnes). A 
study of variation of vitrinite reflectances of PRB coals [6] has revealed values in the range 0.32% to 
0.64% for those in the Gillette coal field. There are also the Rawehide and North Antelope mines fairly 
close to Gillette, both operated by Peabody.

Powder River Basin coals
The Absaloka Mine is across the border to the north, in Powder River County MT, as are the the Spring 
Creek and Decker mines. As the border is approached and crossed, vitrinite refelectances of the coal 
drop to a fairly uniform value of ≈ 0.38%. The indication is that coal from this part of the basin is of 
lower rank than that from close to Gillette, although it is all sub-bituminous. Other mines at PRB include 
Belle Ayr, Black Thunder and Buckskin (all WY).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview
45 
Powder River Basin coals
The Laramie River and Dry Fork power stations are both operated by Basin Electric Power Co-operative. 
The Stanton station in ND has sometimes used PRB coal and sometimes North Dakota lignite. This is 
the only recipient in North Dakota of PRB coal, so at any particular time there might be nil purchase of 
PRB coal in North Dakota notwithstanding its fairly close geographical location. The Eckert power station 
(following row) near Lansing, Michigan has been in service since the 1950s and is seen as an aging facility. 
The Monroe power plant, also in Michigan, has had major modernisation to reduce emissions. PRB coal 
for the Presque Isle facility is conveyed by ship via Lake Superior. Consumption of PRB coal at Sikeston 
in Missouri is 1 million short tons per year. The interested reader can easily perform a calculation like 
that in section 2.4 to show how this is consistent with the nameplate capacity of 235 MW. 
The ‘local coal’ referred to in the entry for Washington State is from the Centralia mine and is also 
sub-bituminous [17]. The Big Cajun II plant in Louisiana (next row) one of the units is to be converted 
to natural gas, a readily available commodity in that state. Conversely, both units at Charles P.Crane 
(next row) were originally fired with fuel oil. The power plants under the entry for Arkansas in the next 
row have a combined capacity of 2.9 GW, representing major capitalisation. Note that petroleum coke 
is used in a blend with PRB at the Allen S. King plant in Minnesota. This of course is obtained from 
refineries, and in Lousiana it is co-fired with lignite in power generation. At Rockport Indiana, following 
row, supercritical steam is used. The North Omaha plant in Nebraska originally used bituminous coal. 
Sometimes when there is a change from a higher rank coal to a lower one the nameplatae capacity of a 
power plant is reduced (‘derating’), but at North Omaha the transition took place without such a penalty. 
The three power plants in the entry for Colorado use PRB coal solely. There are other coal-fired plants 
in the state which use coal mined in Colorado. The Robert W. Scherer power plant in Georgia receives 
coal from PRB by railroad. With reference to the Newton power plant in Illinois, dissatisfaction has 
been expressed that it does not support the local coal industry by using Illinois coal [32]. A move to this 
would involve installation of flue gas desulphurisation (FGD), not required when low-sulphur PRB coal 
is used. The Lawrence Energy Center in Kansas did not initally use PRB coal, but was modified to do 
so. The very heavy utilisation of PRB coal in Texas is clear from the following row. From the next two 
rows it is evident that major amounts of PRB coal have found their way across the border with Canada. 
3.5	
Exports
We saw in the previous chapter how many Asian countries import sub-bituminous coal from Indonesia. 
In 2012, 3.213 million tons of PRB coal were exported repesenting 10% of the total coal exports of the 
USA [47]. A major proportion went to China. The low sulphur is the motive for purchase by China, 
which of course has abundant coal of its own though the production infrastructure is well sub-standard. 
Exports of PRB coal from the west side of the US via the Pacific Ocean have been precluded by the 
absence of facilities there for loading the coal on to ships [48].

Pricing
Factors influencing most strongly the price of a particular coal are calorific value and sulphur content. 
On US markets these are expressed respectively as BTU per lb and on sulphur dioxide production in 
lb per lb of coal burnt. Having regard to the fact that the molar mass of sulphur dioxide is twice that 
of elemental sulphur, this is twice the sulphur content of the coal. Below are June 2015 prices for US 
coals including PRB taken from [49]. The first number in each entry is the calorific value in BTU lb-1 
and the second the lb sulphur dioxide produce per lb coal burnt. Because the molar mass of sulphur 
dioxide is exactly twice that of elemental sulphur, this figure is twice the sulphur content of the coal on 
a fractional basis. 
That PRB coal is very cheap is clear from the comparison. Its low price in some degree is due to its 
restriction to thermal use: being sub-bituminous it is not suitable for use as a coking coal. This also 
reduces potential export markets. It was pointed out in the previous section how PRB coal in huge 
quantities is transported major distances within the US, for example to Texas. This is made possible by 
the low purchase price.

3.7	
The Powder River Basin Coal Users’ Group
The remit of this is to provide ‘the safe, efficient and economic use of PRB coals…’ [50]. It was first 
formed in 2000. It recognises meritorious activity by organisations using PRB coal by making awards. 
For example, the Harrington power plant (fifth row from the bottom of Table 3.1) received such an award 
in 2013. The citation mentioned inter alia the economic use of water at the plant. 
3.8	
Calculated estimates of amounts
A rule sometimes used is that a sub-bituminous coal deposit contains 1770 tons16 per acre-foot [51]. 
One acre foot of coal is that occupying the space enclosed by one acre of surface and one foot depth. 
The acre-foot is clearly a unit of volume and is equal to 1233 m3. These figures are applied to PRB in 
the shaded area below.

An Overview
47 
Powder River Basin coals
The figure of 1770 tons per acre-foot converts to 1.44 tons per cubic metre.
The area of the PRB was given earlier in the chapter as 61000 square kilometres. The total amount of coal in 
PRB, by no means all of which could be extracted by present-day mining methods, has been estimated by the 
USGS as 1.16 trillion tons [52]. A single coal seam representing the entire basin would have a thickness:
1.6 × 1012 tons/(1.44 tons m-3 × 61000 × 106 m2)
= 18 m (60 ft.) 
Coal seam thicknesses of this value and higher – ‘up to 100 ft’ is reported for part of southern PRB [53]  
occur and the calculation has delivered only a semi-quantitative result.
3.9	
Ash fusion temperatures
This topic was introduced in section 2.9, where its significance was explained. A value of 2160oF  
(1182oC) has been reported for a coal from the Spring Creek mine in the PRB [54]. Jacob’s Ranch, which 
features in the table of ash fusion temperatures in Chapter 2, is also in PRB.

3.10	
Conversion to liquid fuels17
There is limited research activity into the conversion of PRB coals to liquids including a recent 
investigation involving Wyodak coal [55]. Catalysts were iron II carbonate and sodium carbonate 
singly and together, and pyrolysis/gasification of the coals in an atmosphere of nitrogen or of nitrogen 
and water. Gasification was at 800°C and was partial, there being char as a side product as well as low 
molecular weight hydrocarbon gases. Tars – possibly the most important class of product in work 
directed at liquefaction –varied in aliphatic:aromatic ratio with different catalysts. This was seen as one 
of the important findings of the work: it means that catalyst composition can be varied to give tars, the 
precursor to synthetic oils, a particular desired aliphatic:aromatic carbon ratio influencing such factors 
as the API Gravity and the viscosity. 
Obviously oil made from coal is not carbon neutral, and one might legitimately wonder what is the 
incentive to make oil from PRB coal. Quite simply it is the superior combustion hygiene of most oil 
burners over coal ones, at least over a transitional period whilst coal burning is reviewed and redeveloped 
in the light of events and requirements over the last fifteen or so years. The huge expanse of terrain 
comprising PRB does in fact contain some conventional crude oil which has been drilled for and raised. 
There is a return to the matter of conversion to liquids in Chapter 11. 
3.11	
Further remarks
This chapter has dealt with the enormous contribution made by PRB coal to the electricity demand of 
North America. Other aspects such as gasification of PRB coal will be dealt with in subsequent chapters 
alongside coverage of such topics for sub-bituminous coals from other sources. In spite of the huge 
amount of lignite used in power generation in the USA, the proportion of lignite to sub-bituminous 
coal mined in 2010 was 0.11. The Powder River resource has clearly strongly affected this proportion. 
Production of liquid fuels from PRB coals is discussed in a later chapter. 
3.12	
Possible carbon sequestration at PRB
There is major CBM production at PRB. In a quiescent coal field conditions of methane retention in the 
pores are close to equilibrium, but not during CBM production and especially not towards the end of a 
CBM recovery operation. If carbon dioxide is at this stage injected into the coal bed, being denser than 
methane (by a factor of 44/16 = 2.75) it displaces further methane in a fashion analogous to enhanced 
oil recovery. As a very significant bonus the carbon dioxide itself becomes adsorbed on to the coal, so 
carbon dioxide sequestration and improved CBM recovery become a combined operation [56]. This is 
not yet a reality at PRB but has been investigated with Wyodak coal [57] and estimates have been made 
of the degree of CCS which could accompany CBM production at Wyodak. In evaluating such operations 
a simple fact of thermodynamics is relevant and has to be carefully considered: if a CO2 molecule is to 
replace a CH4 one at a particular adsorption site it is not a simple exchange, as heats of adsorption of 
the two gases will be different. A related calculation follows as an appendix to the chapter. Safety issues 
at PRB are discussed in Chapter 11.

3.13	
Chemical and petrographic features of selected PRB coals
Certain PRB coals are studied along these lines in [58] and important findings are as follows. Coal from 
the Wyodak-Anderson bed is believed to have originated from dome-shaped peat depositions (‘raised 
peat’), where the coalification process was initiated by conversion of the humic acids. (‘Peat domes’ are 
commonly observed in the landscape of countries including England.) There is volcanic ash present at 
Wyodak-Anderson; constituents enabling the ash to be so classfied include quartz and zircon, and higher 
than usual amounts of the elements phosphorous, niobium, strontium, barium and zirconium. Additional 
to Wyodak-Anderson is the Anderson-Dietz coal bed some kilometres further west, and coal samples 
from here were in the main low in ash. Two particular macerals in the vitrinite group – detrogelinite and 
corpohuminite – were found the be prevalent at Anderson-Dietz. The former is a gellified maceral, having 
lost its woody nature through an intermediate colloidal existence. The Anderson-Dietz bed had been the 
subject of an earlier study [59] in which macerals in all three groups – huminite (a.k.a. vitrinite), liptinite 
and intertinite – were identified. Huminite is the most abundant group at Anderson-Dietz (>85%). A 
moderately plentiful representative of the huminite group is sporinite (up to 6%). Often in coal analysis 
generally the proportions of organic and inorganic (‘pyritic’) sulphur are of interest in utilisation, and 
this point is examined for Anerson-Dietz in [59]. For 33 samples examined the pyritic sulphur was lower 
than the organic, up to about 1 and 2% of the dry coal weight respectively. Interstingly, pyritic plotted 
against organic gave an impressive positive correlation with coefficient 0.87. 
3.14	
Minor inorganic constituents
The following have been detected at trace element level in ash from PRB coal [60]: Cerium, Europium, 
Holmium, Lanthanum, Lutetium, Praseodymium, Promethium, Samarium, Terbium, Ytterbium, 
Actinium, Thorium, Uranium, Plutonium, Berkelium, Californium [60]. Several of these would not 
even have been known to the devlopers and early operators of PRB, for example Berkelium (discovered 
1949) and Californium (discovered 1950). The fact that these are ‘synthetic’ elements observed only as a 
result of nuclear reactions has been raised as a point of criticism [61] as has the fact that the total known 
amount of Promethium in the earth’s crust is of the order of half a kilogram.

Possible carbon sequestration at Wyodak
The study in [57] releates to a 4.8 km × 4.8 km area (about 9 square miles) of Wyodak-Anderson and 
carries the recommendation that there be one injector per square mile, so nine injectors. The datum is 
given that one such injector could enable 0.658 million tons of CO2 to be injected in 20 years. (The 20 
year reference time is probably based on payback time considerations.)

Powder River Basin coals
Converting to an annual basis and equating tons to tonnes for the purposes of an approximate calculation 
such as this, about 300000 tonnes per year of carbon dioxide could be injected through the nine injectors 
collectively. Wyodak coal is about 50% carbon on an as-fired basis [1], so this amount of carbon dioxide 
would be produced by the utilisation of:
300000 × (12/44) × 2 tonnes of the coal ≈ 150000 tonnes
of the coal. In supercritical plant this would raise around 1015J of electricity annually or ≈ 0.25  
billion kWh. This is over a minuscule area of terrain and would offset the carbon dioxide from 30 MW 
of round-the-clock poduction with Wyodak coal.

An Overview

Briquettes
4	 Briquettes
4.1	
Introduction
The compression of coal into pieces of regular shape – briquetting – sometimes requires a binder, 
sometimes not. Lignites, of lower rank than sub-bituminous coals, have over the years since the late 19th 
Century been used in this way, although there is a notable slump in the lignite briquettes market at this 
time. Briquettes production for sub-bituminous coals will be reviewed in this chapter. 
4.2	
Examples
These are given in Table 4.1 below, which is followed by comments.

Table 4.1. Briquettes from sub-bituminous coal.
The reason for incorporating biomass into a coal briquettes is of course that that component is carbon-
neutral. It was noted in Chapter 3 that PRB coal is transported long distances by rail, and if the coal is 
moist part of the transportation cost goes to transporting the water! This point is made very strongly in 
[2] where, with PRB as an example, subsitution of briquettes with their lower water content is advocated.
Of course there would be further issues to be addressed including the grindability of the briquettes 
in comparison with that of the unprocessed coal. The next entry in the table introduces an important 
point: that ‘slacks’ or ‘fines’ created in coal handling can be made into briquettes. Not only are fines and 
slacks without treatment unacceptable to purchasers of coal, they also exacerbate spontaneous heating 
hazards. For them to be made use of in this way is therefore very beneficial. In the work described in 
[3] an asphalt binder was used.

Briquettes
In the BCB process in the following row, applied inter alia to a sub-bituminous coal from South Australia, 
the briquettes are initially produced at a little below the equilibrium moisture content. They are then 
stockpiled, and uptake of moisture to the equilibrium level takes place and is a factor in consolidating 
the briquettes’ structure. Plate 5.1 shows the BCB pilot plant.

There is a long history to the matter of briquettes from Collie coal (following row). As long ago as 1909 
there was discussion of the manufacture of briquettes from Collie coal in the press [5], when successes 
at coal briquetting by that time in Germany and in New Zealand were invoked in favour of entry by 
Western Australia into the business. In 1915–16 Investigations into the briquetting of Collie coal took 
place, not only locally but in England [6]. In England coal tar pitch and petroleum residue were being 
used to make a binder. These were not so readily available in Western Australia but even so a binder 
was developed, and briquettes having good stability – resistance to disintegration – when stockpiled 
were made. Railway use was the incentive for development and an interesting points was made in the 
WA Parliament in support of such use: the briquettes had a lower tendency to eject hot particles via the 
chimney than did the bituminous coals which they were intended to replace, and this was seen as being 
a major advantage when a train was passing through a rural area in dry weather. 
At Tabang [8] in east Kalimantan there were plans to produce produce binderless briquettes from sub-
bituminous coal in a binderless way by the BCB method previously referred to. Plate 4.2 shows the 
briquetting plant at Tabang.

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview
57 
Briquettes
The investigation of Waikato coals in the next row dates back 90 years. The existence of slacks across 
the gamut of New Zealand coals was perceived as a problem, and effort was expended at making these 
into briquettes. In the particular case of the sub-bituminous coal from Waikato briquetting trials using 
an applied pressure of 30 tons per square inch (≡ 400 MPa). The product was too mechanically weak 
for commercialisation. Here again railway use was envisaged. Waikato coal alone had a strong tendency 
to emit hot particles in locomotive use, and it was found that a 50:50 blend of Waikato coal with a 
bituminous coal eliminated this. 
Considerably more recently [10] tests have been made in the co-briquetting of sub-bituminous coal 
from Waikato with peat. Blends of peat-20% coal and peat-40% coal were examined across a range 
of moisture contents. An important property of any fuel briquette is the compressive strength, units 
MPa. This was reduced by the incorporation of coal. For example, at 8% moisture the peat only had a 
compressive strength of 1.5 MPa, the peat-20% coal a value of 0.85 MPa and the peat-40% coal a value 
of 0.4 MPa. However, the effect was less marked at higher moisture contents and at 28% moisture all 
three had compressive strengths in the nieghbourhood of 0.3 to 0.6 MPa. 
The intended use of the briquettes from Nuurst sub-bituminous coal in the following row is electricity 
generation. Some of the coal in this deposit has crossed the classification boundary between sub-
bituminous to high-volatile bituminous [12], although that identified for the briquetting enterprise 
referred to will be entirely sub-bituminous. 
4.3	
Further remarks
That coals of sub-bituminous rank can be briquetted to make a general-purpose solid fuel is clear. That 
being said, the second decade of the 21st Century is not an auspicious time for coal briquettes, and the 
most promise for development and expansion is held by coal briquettes also containing some biomass.

Sub-bituminous coal in co-existence with bituminous.
The product of primary interest in the ENCOL project was the liquid, which was compared with the 
specifications of a No. 6 fuel oil, frequently used as a boiler fuel. It stood up well in all respects, being 
lower in sulphur and in kinematic viscosity. It was recommended that its saleability would be enhanced 
by its fractionation into four products: cresols, two further distillates with distinct boiling ranges and 
heavy residue. Each would require further processing. The solid residue, analogous to petroleum coke, 
from the ENCOL process was seen as being suitable for electricity generation and has the advantage 
over unprocessed coal that it is less productive of dust. In its grindability it compared well with that of 
a Central Appalachian bituminous coal.

Carbonisation and gasification
Moving on to the next row, ‘ammoxidation’ simultaneously oxidises the coal and adds nitrogen to it. In the 
work described in the second row of the table, remarkably high BET18 areas of the product carbons – up 
to 2700 m2g-1 – were reported. Those from the Spanish coal were similarly high, although these values of 
the surface area were obtainable only with a high degree of activation with carbon dioxide entailing loss 
of a major proportion of the initial carbon solid. With the Alberta coal in the following row, the most 
intersting feature was the retention of the macerals. It is less surprising that the maceral having shown 
the greatest resistance to change was fusinite, an interinite maceral. There was also noted that there had 
been little fluid behaviour, which is intuitively consistent with the low rank.
In the work in the following row, primary interest was on the fate of halogens in the coal on pyrolysis. 
Pyrolysis at temperatures up to 600°C led to production of HCl. Some of the HCl so formed reacts with 
metals in the char and with active sites in the carbon structure and is retained as inorganic and organic 
chlorine respectively and this can be released as HCl on pyrolysis at higher temperatures. The preparation 
of metallurgical reductants from coal of any rank other than bituminous has long been a challenge 
and results such as those reported for the Shenfu coal in the next row are encouraging. The Iranian  
sub-sbituminous coal (following row) will form a good, hard product on carbonising.
Obviously in all of these applications there will have been a product gas, and carbonisation where gas is 
the primary product is called partial gasification. The chapter now moves on to gasification.
5.2	
Introduction to gasification
This chapter will be organised in such a way the the sub-bituminous coals having featured in earlier 
chapters will be considered in turn for gasification, starting with Collie coal.
5.3	
Example: Collie, Western Australia
5.3.1	
General-purpose fuel gas
As long ago as 1949, when manufactured fuel gas was much more prevalent than it was later to become 
as natural gas started to replace it, Collie coal was evaluated for gasification [9]. At that time Western 
Australia used imported coal from Newcastle NSW coal to make gas for reticulation to homes and 
businesses. The coal would have had to be brought ≈ 2500 miles by road or rail, so the incentive to use 
local coal was strong.

Carbonisation and gasification
The fact that gasification of Collie coal is still on the agenda is evidenced by a very recent published study 
appertaining to it [10]. Three different atmospheres were used: CO2 only, 15% H2O balance argon and 
15% H2O balance CO2. Temperatures were 800–900°C. Interest was chiefly water and carbon dioxide as 
gasification agents and their reactivities. The atmosphere promoting most rapid conversion of solid to 
gas was that containing both water and carbon dioxide, whilst carbon dioxide only was, in these terms, 
the weakest. The gasification rate with 15% H2O balance CO2 was not equal to the sum of the rates with 
15% H2O balance argon and CO2 only, and it was concluded from this that the reactions:
C + CO2 → 2CO
 and
C + H2O → CO + H2
are kinetically interdependent when both gasifying agents are present. Another route to gasification is of 
course pyrolysis, and Collie coal was examined for pyrolysis under several experimental arrangements 
including fixed bed, fluidised bed and drop tube in [11]. Experiments were performed with and without 
added steam. Temperatures were in the range 600 to 1200°C. The most important finding was that the 
considerable moisture content of the coal as mined – about 20% of the weight – undergoes reaction with 
the coal carbon during pyrolysis and affects the properties of the carbon residue. Where it is intended 
to beneficiate the coal by carbonising it, this is an important issue.

Carbonisation and gasification
5.3.2	
Urea via synthesis gas
There has recently been an investigation into the manufacture of urea from Colli coal via synthesis gas 
[12]. This involves the production of a hydrogen/carbon dioxide mixture from reaction of the coal with 
steam, removal of the carbon dioxide and reaction with nitrogen to form ammonia. This can be reacted 
with carbon dioxide to form urea, and all of this is well known. At the commencement of the project it 
was envisaged that the annual conversion would be of 2.6 Mtonne per year of Collie coal, and a mass 
balance on this is attempted below.
Collie coal is ≈ 70% carbon by weight [13]. The initial reaction:
C + H2O → CO + H2
will in the reaction of 2.6 Mtonne coal involve:
0.7 × 2.6 × 109/0.012 mol of carbon = 1.52 × 1011 mol.
This is unaffected by the shift reaction which converts CO to CO2 for removal.
1 mol H2 → 2/3 mol NH3
and
1 mol NH3 → 0.5 mol urea, N2H4CO (molar mass 0.06 kg)
So amount of urea from 1.52 × 1011 mol carbon is one third of this quantity or 
5.1 × 1010 mol or 3 Mtonne.
5.3.3	
Producer gas
Producer gas is made by passing air into coal, coke or wood. It dates from the 19th Century but is not 
obsolete in the 21st. Because of the low calorific value it is not usually feasible to reticulate producer gas: it 
has to be manufactured where it is required. Over a century ago the matter of producer gas manufacture 
from Collie coal was a live issue [14]. Its proposed application was as fuel for engines. 
5.3.4	
Further remarks
There is activity neither in coal seam gas nor in underground gasification at Collie at the present time.

Carbonisation and gasification
In the work described in the first row there was tar in the products, signifying of course incomplete 
conversion of coal carbon to carbon monoxide. This is common in industrial scale gasifiers of lower 
rank coals. In the work described in the second row the iron II carbonate is redued to elemental iron in 
the first, pyrolytic stages of the gasification and this is converted to iron oxides by the admitted carbon 
dioxide. The iron oxides shuttle oxygen by the reactions:
C + Fe3O4 → 3FeO + CO
and
C + FeO → CO + Fe
A slurry (row 3) is a suitable medium for combustion or gasification, as pointed out in [18], where it is 
also reported that the maximum loading for slurry stability and ease of pumping is 42.5% coal, balance 
water. Surfactants can be used in amounts of the order of 1% to improve slurry stability. In [17] it is 
noted that PRB coals show mercury releases of 3.9 mg per million BTU of heat from the coal when burnt. 
Using a value of 20 MJ kg-1 for the calorific value, this converts to 0.08 p.p.m. of mercury by weight in 
the coal. TRIG™ uses a fluidised bed gasifier, and the method once established used PRB coals over a 
period in excess of a decade. It is recorded [20] that conversions of the organic coal substance of 98% 
or better were achieved. A reader is asked to note that the three journal articles cited in the table are all 
post 2010, which signifies recent and current interest in the gasification of PRB coal. 
5.5	
India, Bangladesh and Pakistan
Calculations in a financial paradigm to evaluate possible underground gasification of a sub-bituminous 
coal in India have been reported [21] in a very recent contribution to the literature. The ‘bottom line’ is 
the cost of operating integrated gasification and electricity production at 100 MW from the gasification 
product. The calculated result was $US1.73 per GJ of heat in the gas, and $US28.18 per MW-hour of 
electricity generated from it. These figures can be further analysed. 
1 GJ is, to within a few percent, equal to 1 million BTU. The Henry Hub price for natural gas – a widely 
applied benchmark – in the first half of 2015 ranged from $US2.61 to $US2.99 per million BTU, so 
the price of the manufactured gas originating in India is favourable according to this comparison. The 
current price of electricity in India is 8 US cents per kW-hour or $US80 per MW-hour, so here again 
the calculated results for integrated underground gasification and power generation are promising. 
Interestingly, the authors of [21] make a comparison with the cost of electricity supply from underground 
gasification with air of PRB coal with air and generation from the product gas at 200 MW. This is given 
as $US12 per MW-hour.

Carbonisation and gasification
Tabulations of coal reserves of the world e.g. [22] state that recoverable reserves of sub-bituminous 
coal in India are nil. This is not because it is non-existent but because it is too deep for mining to be 
feasible in the circumstances. Part of the importance of underground gasification is that it enables coals 
inaccessible by mining to be utilised. 
Prospects for power generation via underground gasification is considered in less precise terms for 
sub-bituminous coal from Bangladesh, where there is significant sub-bituminous coal, in [23]. Land 
subsidence always has to be thought of wherever underground coal gasification is proposed. It is less 
likely to be a difficulty where the gasification site, in effect a ‘reactor’, is deep [24]. Subsidence is high 
on the agenda of issues to be addressed before integrated underground gasification of sub-bituminous 
coal and electricity production becomes a reality in Bangladesh. 
There is sub-bituminous coal in Pakistan at Balochistan as noted in an earlier chapter, but no activity 
in underground gasification. There is active interest in underground gasification of the lignite deposit 
at Thar [25].

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview
65 
Carbonisation and gasification
In Alberta, Canada, Mannville coal, sub-bituminous in rank, has been evaluated in economic terms 
for underground gasification [26] to produce hydrogen as a fuel gas for the local tar sands industry. 
Gasification produces H2 and CO, the latter convertible to CO2 by a shift reaction and removable. An 
important aspect of the study being reviewed is possible capture and sequestration of the carbon dioxide, 
and the cost of the hydrogen depends on whether or not this takes place. The final conclusion was that 
without CCS the hydrogen would cost $1.78 per kg to produce, and with it $2.11 to $2.70 per kg, at the 
2013 value of the dollar. 
5.6	
Hydrogasification
A sub-bituminous coal from Wangjiata, China was examined for hydrogasification in work described 
in [27]. In the presence of a metallic catalyst, samples of the coal were heated to 750°C and reacted in 
nitrogen at 10 bar pressure. In the absence of a catalyst the residual char yield was about 50%; it was 
lowered by about half with a catalyst of which several were tried, a better return of liquid and gaseous 
product. The gases included propane, propene, ethane and ethene. The liquids were largely aromatics 
including benzene, toluene, xylene (BTX) as well as some oxygenates including phenol and cresols.
5.7	
Co-gasification with biomass
In a recently reported study [28] an Indonesian sub-bituminous coal was co-pyrolysed with straw and 
with wood, and the char obtained from the co-pyrolysis gasified with steam. The reactivity to steam 
gasification of either char from co-pyrolysis – that from the coal with straw and that from the coal with 
wood – was higher than that from the coal alone. The coal during pyrolysis is believed to have received 
radicals and hydrogen atoms formed in biomass pyrolysis, and this has influenced both its reactivity 
towards pyrolysis and the gasification reactivity of the solid residue. The biomass was also higher in 
potassium than the coal, and as potassium is known to have a catalytic effect in char gasification that 
would have influenced to gasification rate. The potassium was probably devolatilised from the biomass 
and deposited on the char. 
5.8	
Coalbed methane (CBM)
5.8.1	
PRB
There are thousands of CBM wells in the PRB, and an annual production of billions of cubic metres of 
gas. CBM was discovered there in 1957, and production from two wells in the part of the basin called 
the Wyodak-Anderson coal zone began in 1981 [29]. Between then and 1989 when those wells were 
abandoned, there was major production. In the same year production began at a different part of the 
basin, that in Campbell County and drilling and production expanded. Plate 5.1 below shows a gas well 
in Campbell County, an image taken as recently as the winter of 2015.

Carbonisation and gasification
Current CBM production at PRB is of the order of 25 million cubic metres per day. Most of it enters 
the interstate pipeline network and is used in distant locations including the West Coast. A fraction of 
it is retained for Wyoming, where it is reticulated to users.

South Australia [39].
Exploration activity at the Southern Cooper Basin, the 
Perdika Basin and the Polda Basin, all sub-bituminous.

0.11–6.26 m3 methane per tonne of coal.
Kushiro coal field, Japan [42].
Sub-bituminous coal. The last coal mine in Japan to be closed. 
Before closure producing 2.5 million m3 of methane annually.
As a point of semantics, it should be noted that CBM is often and not incorrectly termed natural gas, 
indistinguishably from that arising in conventional gas fields or from tight gas fields. The sub-bitumunous 
coal at Huntly in the first row has made several previous appearances in this book. Reference [31] gives 
for comparison a value for PRB of up to 2.67 m3 of gas per short ton. The Brazilian coal field in the next 
row extends to below the sea, and it is estimated that the offshore part of the field (which also contains 
high-volatile bituminous coal) has a methane content of 56 billion cubic metres. The Upper Silesian 
coal basin contains sub-bituminous as well as higher rank coal, and vitrinite reflectances range from 
0.84 to 1.5%.

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview
68 
Carbonisation and gasification
Reference [34] digresses into sapropelic coals and notes that gas from these contains more C2+ 
hydrocarbons than gas from humic coals. This moves the discussion on to an important point. With 
conventional natural gas there is often condensate, and this might well be of greater monetary value 
than the gas which bears it. It sells for a price about equivalent to that of crude oil on a barrel basis and 
requires less refining as there is no heavy residue. The view is often taken that CBM does not contain 
condensate and this is largely true. However even with CBM from humic coals there can be some higher 
hydrocarbons, more therefore from sapropelic coals, and whether these constitute ‘condensate’ is a fruitful 
line of enquiry for future production. At the Ukranian coal reserve in the next row an averaged value 
of the methane content was found to be 14.7 m³ per tonne. This is a high value, and is well exceeded in 
parts of the Donets Basin. Plate 5.2 shows a mine at Donets. 
The Perth Basin (following row) takes in the sub-bituminous coal at Collie, which has featured previously 
in this book. The coal from the Philippines in the next row is Miocene. The assertion is made in [37] 
that it is equivalent to PRB coals in methane content.
Plate 5.2. Mine in the Donets Basin. Image taken from: 
http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pic%5CA%5CR%5CArtemivsk%20(Luhansk%20oblast)%20mine.jpg
At the Polda Basin in the following row, a petrographic similarity to Walloon coal (Table 1.2) has been 
noted. Coal at the Ordos Basin in China is low in vitrinite and remarkably high – up to 85.6% – in 
macerals of the inertinite group.

Introduction
Sometimes coal of any rank is a geological feature of an otherwise inorganic formation, almost an 
intrusion, and being in small quantities is not seen as being a reserve for mining. Sometimes the 
geographical location of a site of coal precludes mining, there being in any case no market for it or means 
of transporting it. One tends to look in the geology literature rather than the fuel technology literature 
for examples of such, some of which follow.

Huminite, liptinite and inertinite up to 81.4%, 16.1% and 
13.5% respectively. Huminite reflectance 0.41 to 0.42%. 
Lafia and Enugu deposits, Nigeria [21].
Respectively 77.6 and 63.1% vitrinite. Enugu of

Reshit, northern Pakistan [26].
The scene of mining on a small scale. 
Coal sub-bituminous in rank.
Dominant macerals in the coal from the Canadian Arctic (row 1) include alginite, exudatinite and 
sporinite, all in the liptinite group [2]. The coal at the Western Black Sea is fairly incidental, the commercial 
interest being in hydrocarbons; this is consistent with the comments in the previous section. The same is 
true of the coal offshore Vietnam, which co-exists with lignite. This is consistent with the lower vitrinite 
reflectance, which indicates that the sub-bituminous coal is closer to the boundary with lignite than 
to the boundary with bituminous. The Fushun Basin (following row) is a major producer of shale. At 
the Pannonian Basin (following row) there is oil at depths between 300 m and 1500 m. The coal at the 
Antarctic location co-exists with silicified21 peat. At Buller sub-bituminous coal and bituminous co-exist: 
the vitrinte reflectance range is 0.5 to 1.5. Clearly the literature cited in the table up to and including 
the ninth row is focused either on hydrocarbon prospects or on the geology without any regard for 
sub-bituminous coals per se.

At Mchuchuma (row 10) a coal-fired power station is planned [12]. A 600 MW output using subcritical 
steam is projected, full operation being hoped for in 2019. A scene from the Mchuchuma mine forms Plate 
9.1 below. The coal at Disko Island (next row) has been reported [14] as having a vitrinite reflectance of 
0.48%, consistently with its sub-bituminous rank. The coal from the Himalayas in the row 13 conforms 
in the highest degree conceivable to the term ‘isolated settings’ in the chapter title. Large parts of the 
region containing the deposit are uncharted. The mine in Burma in the next row is also in a fairly remote 
spot, close to the Burma-India border. The region is however served with transport including a railway. 
Ecuador does not currently produce coal of any rank. There has been exploration and exploratory drilling 
at places including the Rio Malacatos field (sub-bituminous), the Azoques-Biblian mine (lignite to sub-
bituminous) and the Cuenca El Derrumbo field (lignite to sub-bituminous) [17]. Possible utilisation 
needs more work on such matters as ash content. The sub-bituminous coal (next row) in Uruguay is 
Permian. Classification of these as sub-bituminous might be broadened to sub-bituminous/lignite or to 
sub-bituminous/bituminous on further exploration. 
Turning to Peru, sub-bituminous coal from the Goyllarisquizaa Mine, used in carbonisation, was 
discussed previously. There are other scenes of sub-bituminous coal in Peru which have not been worked 
and are not likely to be without much further preparatory work; these belong in this chapter. These are 
Cretaceous or Jurrassic and include the coal in the Huancavelica region of the country, once a scene of 
mining of mining mercury ore and now a centre of hydroelectricity. The only thermal power plant in 
Peru uses fuel oil.

Sub-bituminou s co al  in isol ated setting s a nd  in unwo rked deposit
The deposit in Serbia has been included in this chapter on the grounds that it has not been significantly 
worked in the 21st Century (although prior to that there was major exploitation). The current coal 
production of Nigeria (following row) is almost negligible [20] in spite of there being well characterised 
deposits of coals across the ranks taking in sub-bituminous. That Nigeria is not aquiescing in this state 
of affairs is evidenced by recent work on the combustion of Lafia coal in a fluidised bed [22] on an 
intermediate scale using coal admittance rates to the bed of up to 0.3 kg s-1 giving heat release rates up 
to ≈ 10 MW. The work is focused on eventual electricity production from the coal in a fluidised bed, so 
there is some emphasis on NOx production in particular possible use of oxyfuel to eliminate thermal NOx. 
The second of the Antarctican coals in the table (following row) occurs as layers within a formation of 
dolerite. The information on Saudi Arabia in the next row appertains to the Jauf formation which contains 
major oil fields. Co-existence of a layer (not fragments) of a sub-bituminous coal with sand and plant 
remains was observed in core logging at Jauf [25]. The coal at the Pakistan/Afghanistan border (very 
difficult to access) was found as stated in the table to be in the sub-bituminous to bituminous range to 
the exclusion both of lignite and of anthracite. The small scale mining of sub-bituminous coal at Reshit 
(following row) began after the discovery of coal there in 1996, and awareness of the obvious benefit of 
a coal deposit to such an isolated community. At a Himalayan location, it is possibly the highest altitude 
scene of coal mining in the world.

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview

Conversion to liquid fuels
The Tanito Harum coal was studied alongside a number of lignites, and it is noted that compared with 
the liquefaction product from those that from Tanito Harum was high in asphaltenes. A little over simply 
perhaps, one might reason that fuel from Tanito Harum could contribute to the 7000 barrels per day of 
bunker fuel which Indonesia’s shipping or persons around the multiple islands of that nation requires [2]. 
(The number is of course much larger if oil and LNG tanker movements are factored in.) The coal from 
Shenfu (next row) also featured in Table 5.1. Preashpaltenes are so named because of their appearance 
in advance of asphaltenes in the common sequence of solvent extraction, and are often more polar 
than asphaltenes. Both have molar masses of the order of 1000 g mol-1. Moving on to the next row, the 
liquefied products are oils, asphaltenes and preasphaltenes. Proportions do not differ markedly across 
the range of intitial blend compositions. Obviously the motive for co-liquefaction with sawdust is an 
end product which is in part carbon-neutral.
In the work in the next row of the table, comparisons are made with the behaviour of a bituminous 
coal subjected to the same experimental conditions. The inherently higher reactivity of sub-bituminous 
coals as compared to bituminous is invoked and the interesting point made that this necessitates more 
rapid suppy of hydrogen for liquefaction of sub-bituminous, otherwise broken bonds in the coal will 
combine with each other instead of with hydrogen. The result of this will be insoluble organic matter 
(IOM) which is not a desired product. 
In the work in the following row the Wyoming coal was examined alongside two others of different rank 
and the liquefaction products divided into two classes: asphaltenes and ‘OGW’ (oil, gas and water). The 
work is focused on catalyst performance, and for the Wyoming coal total conversion was better with a 
Ni/Mo catalyst than with a Co/Mo catalyst. Moving on to the next row of the table, liquefaction was with 
tetralin and hydrogen (4 MPa) or with tetralin only, in which case an equivalent pressure was provided 
by admittance of nitrogen. The trend of results is interesting. With the untreated (not solvent-swollen) 
coal conversion is higher under hydrogen than under nitrogen. The reverse is true – though not to a 
very marked degree – with coal swollen either by pyridine or by THF, and total yield of liquid higher 
with the swollen coals.

Conversion to liquid fuels
In the work in the following row of the table light aromatics were dominant in the liquid products. 
The composition of the catalyst had a strong effect on the distribution of product between liquid and 
gaseous, the former always being lower than the latter and favoured by higher loadings of calcium in 
the catalyst. The gases included C3 hydrocarbons which can of course be made into LPG and there was 
also ethane, a very saleable substance. Moving to the next row we note that Deitz is in fact part of PRB. 
The best O:A ratio, a value of 1.25, was obtained with naphthalene only and no catalyst at 425oC, but 
the total conversion was only 25.4%. The highest total conversion of 86.5% was achieved with two-stage 
heating – initially 350°C raised to 425°C – with SAM and THQ. This gave an O:A ratio of just under 
0.5. The gas yield was 5.1% of the coal weight, and the dominant constituent was carbon dioxide with 
some carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulphide and hydrocarbons. The two-stage heat process did seem 
to provide for good results, for example an O:A ratio of 1.19 with THQ and no catalyst , the total 
conversion being 39.5%. This work consisted then of holding in balance single- or two-stage heating 
with two catalysts and presence or absence of THQ additional to naphthalene. Sometimes THQ itself 
was absent but the catalyst made from it present. Under two-stage heating conditions thisgave a total 
conversion of 79.4% and an O:A yield of 0.41. The reason for the requirement of a good O:A yield is of 
course that asphaltenes are on high molar mass – in excess of 1000 g per mol as noted above – and this 
is characteristic of residuals in crude oil refinining, whereas coal-derived counterparts of distillates are 
more saleable. Even so a product with a high proportion of asphaltenes could be used in two common 
ways: as shipping fuel or in a power plant set up to use heavy fuel oil. Such might of course be the desired 
end product of the liquefaction. 
Moving on to the next row, with pyridine as solvent conversions were up to >80% and comparable 
conversions were observed with toluene and with THQ. One of the Wyodak coals was subjected before 
the liquefaction tests to pretreatment, drying or solvent (THQ) immersion. Conversion in a toluene 
solvent was enhanced by either sort of treatment. Other things being equal, THF pre-treatment raised 
the conversion from 76% to 84%. Prior drying of the coal under nitrogen also had a strong liquefaction 
promoting effect. The papers in rows four and nine of the table were seen by the authors as being 
complementary. This leads to the point that at the time the work was done in the mid ‘eighties oil prices had 
undergone a steep surge [12] so that interest into making oil from coal was strong and attracted funding.

Conversion to liquid fuels
For the coal in the work in [11] the ‘empirical formula’ can be calculated from proximate analysis data 
as C5.74H5O1.07
23
 (≡CH0.87O0.19). Oxygen loss is by devolaltilisation and retention in the solid products. The 
effect of the liquefaction is conversion, to the degree of 4.8%, to hydrocarbons in the neighbourhood of 
C12. The molar mass corresponding to the empirical formula is 91 g mol-1 whilst that of the hydrocarbons 
from it is of the order of 120 g mol-1. The gain is therefore about 30 g mol1, the resultant of oxygen loss 
and hydrogen acquisition. The solvent does not have a conceptually simple ‘shuttling’ role but donates. 
The catalyst possibly ‘shuttles’ hydrogen.
7.3	
Further remarks
A point already touched on is that the viability of coal-to-oil schemes are very dependent on crude oil 
prices and very vulnerable when they drop. Coal-to-oil schemes have tended to meet contingencies, for 
example in South Africa during sanctions and in Germany during WWII (bituminous coal and lignites 
rexpectively). One has to remember also that over supply of crude oil is avoided. There is the additional 
factor of non carbon neutrality of anything made from coal, and the competition with such things as 
biodiesels and ethano; fuels which are carbon neutral.

Table 8.1  below gives details of fatal accidents involving sub-bituminous coals. The coal was sometimes 
in co-existence with bituminous. 
Location, year and reference.
Details.
 Kaitangata, New Zealand 1879 [1].
34 deaths, no survivors. Carbon monoxide explosion 
believed to have been the cause. 
Frontier mine, Wyoming 1923 [2].
99 deaths. ‘Pockets of gas’ most likely methane the cause.
Hanna, Wyoming, 1908, one 
of a succession of serious 
accidents there [3]. 
59 deaths. Some of the bodies from an earlier (1903) accident at Hanna 
never recovered. The 1908 accident caused by explosive gas. 
Amaga Colombia  
(see section 1.2) [5].
12 fatalities from flooding at a mine in 2014.
West Ridge mine, Utah [7]
1 fatality by crushing at a piece of plant. September 2014.
Although Sir Humphry Davy had given the world his safety lamp long before the Kaitangata accident in 
1879, a naked candle was in use at the mine. The consequences were very grave. The Frontier mine in 
Wyoming (next row) had been in use for about 25 years by the time of the explosion, and its products 
were directed to railroad use. There were many ‘pockets of gas’ and these could (ought) to have been 
burnt off in a controlled way for the safety of the miners. There were established means for doing this 
long before 1923. Coal from Hanna was exclusively for railroad use. The accident record of coal mining 
in Wyoming in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries is dismal, and a reader will find examples additional 
to the above in [4], in which it is recorded that coal mining began in Wyoming in 1868. Plate 10.1 below 
shows a miner preparing for duty at Hanna mine. The considerable propensity of Amaga coal (next row) 
to spontaneous heating has been noted [6].

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview
86 
Safety ii ssue s with  
sub-bituminou s coal
The West Ridge mine in Utah (next row) produces 10000 US tons of raw coal per day and methane 
release [7] is 1454019 cubic feet per day (≈41000 cubic metres per day or 25 tonnes per day). A totally 
arbitrary calculation not intended to relate in any way to West Ridge follows in the shaded area below. 
The methane production rate converts to 1000 cubic feet per minute. To keep the methane at below 
1.25% by volume – one quarter of the lower flammability limit of methane – 80000 cubic feet per 
minute of air will be required. We simply note that this is a sensible order of magnitude and that 
a reader will find comparable figures in online sources for such ventilation rates e.g. [8].
 
In Australian mining practice evacuation is required if the methane level reaches or exceeds 2% 
[9]. At 1.25%, the value used in the calculation, trip of electrical devices is required.

Safety at PRB
A report is extant which summarises the safety record of coal production at PRB over the quarter-century 
1980–2005 [10], and records an average annual death rate over that time span of 5 per year. Over the 
same period the average for the total of the USA in power-related coal winning was 33 per year. A finger 
is pointed clearly at dust explosions as the origin of many of these deaths, and accordingly studies of 
dust explosions. In experimental testing the severity of a dust explosion in air is expressible in terms of 
two quantities: the maximum pressure Pmax and the maximum rate of pressure rise (dP/dt)max. In [11] 
the latter is given for a PRB coal as being:
(dP/dt)max of 500 bar s-1 at a dust concentration of 750 g m-3, maximum pressure 8 bar.

Spontaneous heating
A recent discourse [12] is concerned with spontaneous heating of a sub-bituminous coal from Indonesia. Not 
for the first time, oygen consumption rate (OCR) was used as an indicator of spontaneous heating activity. 
At the commencement of an experimental trial this was just under 20 mg O2 mg-1 coal day-1 at 70°C, the 
corresponding values at 50°C and 30°C being 5 and 1 in the same units. As sites in the coal become occupied 
with oxygen molecules the rate of uptake declines, to almost zero for the higher temperatures. It is widely 
known that water plays a significant role in spontaneous heating of coal of any rank, largely because water 
vapour can enter pores within a coal and become adsorbed, releasing the ‘heat of wetting’ which acclerates the 
primary effect which is oxidation. Hysteresis in an adsorption-desorption cycle is common and was indeed 
displayed by the Indonesian sub-bituminous coal. At 40°C and 100% humidity, the coal adsorbed water at 
up to 20% of the coal weight, declining to about 6% at 50% humidity. This lab-scale work was followed by 
an investigation involving two ‘test piles’ intially at ambient temparature, one of 4 m height the other of 15m: 
obviously other things being equal the higher pile will self-heat more powerfully. The profile through each 
pile was approximately an isosceles triangle. Temperature measurement was carried out at points within the 
piles over a one-month period, and for the higher pile an internal temperature of up to > 70°C was observed 
after a month, and this was still rising when testing ceased. For the shorter pile The maximum internal 
temperature attanied was a little below 60°C ands declined towards the end of the measurement period. Quite 
clearly, the shorter pile was thermally sub-critical at that ambient temperature and the taller pile super-critical. 
Laboratory simulation of these effects at oven temperatures with small (> 1 kg) samples would have been a 
helpful extension of the work in [12] which, as stated, has been chosen for coverage herein partly on account 
of its being very recent. That there is current interest in the issue of spontaneous heating of sub-bituminous 
coal is clear. As a general point one expects them to be more susceptible to self-heating than bituminous coal 
or anthracite and less susceptible than lignite. This trend can be correlated directly with volatile matter content.

Sub-bituminous Coals:  
An Overview

Pricing of sub-bituminous coals
Reference [1] states that Collie coal was at that time poised for a price increase of about $A7 per tonne. 
The price for the Indonesian coal is that given by IHS McCloskey25, who assign prices to coals from 
many countries; these are adjusted twice a week. IHS McCloskey prices are for a particular calorific value 
on a Net as Received (NAR)26 basis, in the case of the prices in the table 4900 kcal kg-1 (20.6 MJ kg-1). 
Reference [2] gives the benchmark calorific value for bituminous coals as a minimum of 18 MJ kg-1 
and of anthracite a minimum of 21.0 MJ kg-1. The low minimum for bituminous is probably due to the 
need to bring high-ash bituminous coals within the scope of the pricing. That is implicit in the term ‘as 
received’ and subsequent cleaning is of course possible. The June 2015 price is said [4] to be indicative of 
adverse circumstances (‘tough times’) for sub-bituminous coal production in Indonesia. The interesting 
point is made in [5] that exports of Kalimantan coals are affected by the water levels at two local rivers. 
The Korean temder in row 5 was for bituminous as well as sub-bituminous: for the former the price 
was $82 NAR basis, same calorific value. The calorific value is perhaps an impossibly high one for sub-
bituminous. This makes the value a pivot point for scaling: in practice a lower calorific value coal will 
be accepted and the price adjusted accordingly. This is very simple [7]. One formula is:
Pcs = Pb × CVcs/CVb
where P refers to price and CV to calorific value, the subscripts ‘cs’ and ‘b’ referring respectively to price 
paid and the benchmark price. The advantage of the above, especially where an ‘as received’ basis applies, 
is that two factors strongly affecting the CV – the moisture and ash contents – do not and need not 
appear explicitly in the formula. We transfer the benchmark price of $72 per tonne for calorific value 
25 MJ kg-1 from the particular to the general and postulate that sub-bituminous coal of 18 MJ kg-1 is in 
fact supplied. The price paid will be:
(18/25) × $72 per tonne = $52 per tonne.
Moving on to the next row of the table, the value has to be compared with $60.61 per US ton for 
bituminous, $19.96 per US ton for lignite and $87.82 per US ton for anthracite. This leads to the point 
that the prices expressed on a heat basis can show different trends. The price on a heat basis is usually 
per million BTU (MBTU). Converting to SI units gives:
106BTU = 106 × 252 cal BTU-1 × 4.2 J cal-1 = 1.06 GJ.
We assign values of 25, 20, 18 and 12 MJ kg-1 to the calorific values of anthracite, bituminous coal, sub-
bituminous coal and lignite respectively on an as-received basis. The price of 1 million BTU (1 GJ) from 
the sub-bituminous coal, having regard to the fact that 1 US ton = 907 kg, will be: 
14.86 $ ton-1 × (1/907) ton kg-1 × 109 J/18 × 106 J kg-1) = $0.91.

An Overview

Pricing of sub-bituminous coals
The costs for one million BTU from the bituminous coal, the anthracite and the lignite are respectively 
$3.34, $3.87 and $1.84. In weight terms the order of costs was:
anthracite > bituminous > lignite > sub-bituminous
and this trend is repeated when the calculation is done on a per unit heat basis. PRB coals are used to 
such a huge extent that it is reasonable to compare the price per million BTU with that for natural gas 
in the same units. (In marketing, only gaseous fuels are traded on a heat basis to the exclusion of weight 
basis). The benchmark natural gas price which applies in the US is the Henry Hub price, which on the 
day on which in November 2015 averaged $2.09 per million BTU, so PRB coal represents a highly viable 
fuel in these comparative terms. The above order of costs on a heat basis could be annotated:
 natural gas
↓
anthracite > bituminous > lignite > sub-bituminous
A reader will have noted from earlier parts of this chapter that the averaged value for the US exceeds 
that for PRB. PRB is the largest, but there are other deposits of sub-bituminous coal in the USA. Such 
coals occur in the Illinois basin, which takes in parts of Illinois, Kentucky and Indiana where bituminous 
domonates but, as stated, sub-bituminous is to be found. There is also significant sub-bituminous coal 
in Utah. (See also section 2.7.) One reason PRB coal is cheap is that mining is at open pits. It has 
been pointed out [9] that this cost benefit is being diminished by the need to dig deeper and to install 
conveyors to utilisation sites. 
9.2	
Further remarks
‘Carbon costs’ obviously have to be factored into the use of sub-bituminous coals in power generation. 
Relevant factors are the possibility of sequestration and the cost and tradability of carbon credits.
