Introduction
Introduction
Our 21st century economy presents considerable challenges to many. Hardest hit: the recent graduate 
struggling to find work among a sea of applicants; some with far more experience and industry knowledge.
In 21st Century Internships – How to get a job before graduation, authors David Shindler and Mark Babbitt 
take a no-nonsense look at the importance of internships to your early career; the development of soft 
skills that go well beyond what might have been learned in the classroom; and the impact of hands-on 
experience on your ability to become highly employable.
The authors share their combined knowledge of internships, career development and your ability to get 
job offers from great companies – by taking a detailed look at these points vital to your career:
• Why multiple internships during the college years are now imperative to young professionals
• The skills and traits in demand now – and how those skills are gained – and greatly 
improved through internships
• Where to find high-impact, mentor-based internships (versus the out-dated exploitive 
model still being offered far too often today)
• The role of networking and social media in securing, and making the best of, your 
internship
• Seeking out mentors during your internship – and building lifelong, mutually-beneficial 
professional relationships
• How to ensure that an internship opportunity is the right culture fit for you (and the 
company)
• Focus on the end-game, by keeping a record of achievement and quantifiable contributions 
during your internships
• Using internships as a career compass; steering your professional life in the right direction 
based on your passions, goals and knowing what you want to do (and, perhaps after an 
internship or two, what you know you do not want to do)
• How to turn an internship into a full-time job offer
The advice provided, from the perspective of two experts widely recognized for their mentorship and 
impactful career advice, makes 21st Century Internships – How to get a job before graduation  a must-have 
book for higher education students, recent graduates, young professionals – and those career professionals 
and mentors who guide them.

What is an internship?
1	 What is an internship?
The internship model has existed since about 1750 BC in Babylon. Back then, an intern was taught 
a trade or craft, perhaps as a brick layer, basket master or silversmith. Perhaps fortunately for today’s 
aspiring young professional, much has changed since. 
One critical point, however, remains the same: an internship is hands-on, experiential training that 
enables the intern to apply learned theory to the real world. 
Today, internships are typically for current students of higher education; often for school credit. In 
addition, recent graduates and young professionals with the desire to gain experience also seek internships. 
In our new economy, high school students seeking to gain a career edge, or career direction, are also 
pursuing internships.
Preferable to most, an internship falls within your career of choice – typically in white collar or professional 
occupations. The best kind of internships, in addition to improving your technical skills, also help you 
improve your soft skills, expand your personal networks and enable you to begin building a credible 
personal brand.
Some institutions of higher education require internships – also known as “cooperative education” 
(also referred to as “co-ops”) or “experiential education” – to graduate; most notably Cornell, George 
Washington, MIT, Northeastern and Rochester Institute of Technology.

What is an internship?
Typically, internships are hosted by a company, government office, non-profit or start-up. Those 
organizations (along with the intern, in best-case scenarios) determine learning objectives, milestones, 
soft skills to be developed or improved, networking opportunities and the intern’s level of contribution. 
Internships are unique opportunities to learn, grow and develop in-demand professional 
skills.
Internships typically run the length of a semester or a season. However, shorter project-based internships 
are becoming common, as are traditional and virtual internships that may extend past the typical 10 
to 13 weeks. Internships differ from job shadowing and externships (longer-term “job shadows”, if you 
will) in that they typically require a longer, and more formal, commitment with a focus of training 
versus observing.

Why are internships important?
2	 Why are internships important?
In our current economy, the “entry-level” professional has been significantly – perhaps negatively – 
impacted; organizations are running leaner – and must “do more with less”. 
As a result, many believe the days of securing a job based on having a college degree alone, without 
practical experience, are gone. Some would say there is no such thing as an entry-level position anymore; 
employers are demanding – and hiring – young talent ready to go to work, right now. 
This is where internships play a major role in the education process, careers and the workplace. 
According to a survey by the Chronicle of Higher Education and American Public Media’s Marketplace, 
employers strongly prefer relevant experience over academic achievement: 
“Students’ grades and their colleges’ reputations are hardly the most important factors. 
Employers want new graduates to have real world experience. Internships and work during 
college matter most: Employers said that each of those was about four times as important as 
college reputation, which they rated least important. Relevance of coursework and GPA [degree 
class] rounded out the bottom of the list.”
According to US-based National Association of Colleges and Employers, 9 out of 10 direct-
from-college job offers go to those with internship experience on their resume; often 
times, those who receive the job offer have multiple internships under their belt.

Why are internships important?
Other than greatly increasing your employability, there are many reasons why an internship is vital to 
your career development:
• Practical experience
• Confidence and professional poise 
• Professional networking opportunities
• Validation of major, degree and career choice
• Development of an employable personal brand
• First-hand knowledge of the industry and/or company
• A sense of contribution in a non-academic environment
• Development of high-impact mentor relationships (see chapter 8)
Employers also benefit from hiring and mentoring young talent through internships:
• Expansion of bandwidth and manpower
• Productive ties to local higher education 
• Delegation of non-core tasks and responsibilities
• The opportunity to attract Millennial/Gen Y talent
• Taking on enthusiastic talent to solve business challenges
• A “pay-it-forward” approach to grooming young professionals
• A cost-effective, low risk way of “trying out” potential team members
Done right, with both the professional development of the intern and the company mission in mind, 
internships are often the proverbial “win-win”.

Timing of an internship
3	 Timing of an internship
3.1	 How many internships should I complete?
When many of us think of internships, we think of the single 40-hour-per-week, 10-week summer 
program performed between our junior and senior years. While these traditional summer internships 
remain prevalent, there are now many other forms of internships that contribute greatly to your 
employability.
• During semester | 10 to 20 hour-per-week internships performed while attending class
• Virtual | Year-round internships performed remotely via internet, Skype, email, etc.
• Project-based | Internships focused on completing a single specific task or business function
Regardless of the type of internship you pursue, the new standard for 
internships is to complete one high-impact internship for every year you’re in 
college…
An undergraduate degree = 4 completed internships 
A post-graduate degree = a total of 6 completed internships

Timing of an internship
While this “new normal” is a dramatic change from just a few years ago (and, frankly, a lot of work) 
consider this: organizations like Google, AOL, TripAdvisor – and many highly coveted internship hosts – 
prefer you already have 3 to 5 internships under your belt to even be considered for their internships. 
Yes, the internship world is now that competitive.
While you should complete at least one internship per year, you simply cannot over-commit. Otherwise, 
your classes, personal life and even your health may be affected.
The key to success: balancing academic, extra-curricular and social calendars with proactive 
career development.
Good general rules:
• When taking classes full-time: take on no more than one 10 to 15 hour-per-week internship; 
very important: make sure the employer understands you are fully committed to your 
academics and they are willing to work around – and properly communicated – schedule
• Winter break: Take on a project-based internship of no more than 4 to 6 weeks; to allow 
time to spend with your family, consider a virtual internship
• Summer break: Take on the larger, perhaps full-time, 10 to 13 week commitment…and go 
“all in”
3.2	 When should I apply?
Some young careerists begin school with very little idea of what career path to take when they graduate. 
That’s natural; college is a time for growth and exploration. And that includes career exploration!
Explore your career possibilities through internships as soon as possible – 
 starting your freshman year.
The earlier you start, the more time you have to gain experience. Just as important, you’ll have a clear 
idea whether your degree – and chosen profession – is right for you. Wouldn’t you rather know that 
now…instead of just before your senior year…when you can still change your major/degree and dodge 
the “my job sucks” bullet?

21st Century Internships

Timing of an internship
Because many internships follow academic calendars, when you should apply also depends greatly on 
the size and type of the company:
• More traditional, larger employers hire their summer internships as early as January; fall 
interns are selected in early summer, etc.
• Smaller, more contemporary companies hire just before the new “internship season” begins; 
for example, a summer intern isn’t hired until late April or into May
• Many other organizations, including start-ups and non-profits hire interns year-round; for 
them, there is no internship season
Here’s what may be most important, however…
When you find an open internship position that intrigues you, research the company, tailor your resume/
CV to the position, write a high-quality cover letter and apply. Don’t over-prioritize the “season”. Don’t 
think about “Will they think I’m too young?” 
When you present yourself as a confident and competent candidate, and you have the skill set that 
matches the recruiter’s needs, you’ve given yourself the best chance to get an interview. Neither your 
timing – nor your age – will matter.
One more thought on when to apply…
Young professionals who brand themselves as highly employable before graduation recognize their 
current position is only one step on their career path. They plan now, for the next internship or job. 
During your current internship, make sure you’re networking – making contacts and building relationships 
that will help you gain your next position.

18 
Timing of an internship
Yes, even when you already have an internship … you should be looking for your next!
Another good way to plan ahead is to periodically (but regularly) review online internship and job postings 
in your industry. Do so not necessarily with the intent to apply, but to become familiar with the latest 
skills employers in your field are hiring for, and what responsibilities you might face in those positions. 
This “eye on your future” will help guide your career development, and give you an edge over much of 
your competition.

What do employers really want?
4	 What do employers really want?
Many employers regard internships as an extended interview; a way of seeing the capability and potential 
of a person – you – over an extended period of time. At the same time, they expect the intern to contribute 
and add value to their company. Just like they do when hiring a permanent employee, employers are 
looking for what makes you “employable”. 
In very simple terms, being employable means you are a good fit within the specific role, culture 
and business of an employer – whether you are applying for a job or are already an intern within an 
organization. It’s more than just what you know and can do; your attitude and approach to continuous 
learning, the activities you engage in outside your degree and how well-rounded you are as a person all 
provide a picture of what you are likely to bring to an employer.
For students or for those freshly graduated, employers want to know how ‘market-ready’ you are – right 
now. They do not expect you to be the finished article, however; often, they are far more interested in 
your attitude than your skills. After all, the latter can be further developed once you join. 
“Mindset will often trump technical skills” 
John Reed, Chairman of the London recruitment firm, Reed
When examining whether you’re a good fit for their organization, employers look at critical attributes 
such as:
Professionalism
Do you understand the level of professionalism we expect in our company? Can you demonstrate that 
you have the character and work ethic we expect? Who are you as a person? Does your unique value 
proposition demonstrate that you can do this job and that you are the right one for us?
Consistently exhibiting the right mindset can turn an internship into 
a genuine opportunity for employment.
Skill set
Do you know, and can you demonstrate, the professional, soft and technical skills required to succeed 
here? Are you a problem-solver, a communicator and a strategic thinker? Are you able to self-learn 
critical skills? Are you coachable?

What do employers really want?
Knowledge
Do you get our business model and the world we inhabit? Can you put yourself in our customers’ shoes? 
How will what you know and have experienced to date help you to be successful in this role? Most 
important, are you passionate about the mission of our organization…and can you help us move that 
mission forward?
At the very least, a job well done can establish you as a mentee worth mentoring – and set you up for a 
sterling recommendation that will help you get your next internship, or a job.
But what is the right mindset? What are employers looking for – from you?
Positive attitude
Enthusiasm and a “can do” attitude come from your personality, choosing your attitude and enjoying 
your job. Take initiative, empathize and see how to make the task at hand – and the company – better.
Self-management
Employers want active team members willing to take responsibility; they choose to hire self-starters who 
are assertive, resilient, balanced, reliable and able to juggle tasks without panic. They expect you to be 
committed to – and accountable for – your own development.
Teamwork
You must know what good teamwork looks like – and, based on your strengths, how you can best 
contribute. Cooperating, leading and following are all critical, and in-demand, skills. 
Communication
You must be able to listen well – and to confidently ask good questions; the kind that elicit thoughtful 
response. You should be able to build rapport and trust. Perhaps most important, you must be able to 
verbally articulate your views in a coherent manner and produce structured written work.
According to many surveys where employers were asked what they desire most from graduates  
…verbal and written communication were listed as the most in-demand skills.
Technological savvy
It will be expected that you will have a thorough understanding of information, social and digital 
communication tools. From MS Office Suite to mobile apps, search engines and the Internet…you must 
be savvy. From the employer’s perspective: embrace the digital revolution or be considered obsolete.

What do employers really want?
Analytical thinking
Analyzing facts and situations; creative thinking and working to understand problems and develop 
solutions in a collaborative manner is critical; creative problem solving – applying your imagination (we 
all have one!) – is a top demand of most employers.
Skill with numbers
Applying basic numerical concepts to everyday life takes you a long way. Quick mental calculations like 
estimating and working out a percentage instantly are more-than-impressive skills. 
Business and customer awareness
A fundamental component of employability is how well you manage relationships with customers, 
users, partners and vendors. To impress, align your mindset with the behavior you want to present to a 
customer, every time, and look wider than your role.
Collaboration
Collaborators build relationships through trust and are comfortable with interdependence, crossing 
boundaries, self-disclosure and feedback. They value others’ opinions and have a win-win mentality, 
networking skills and mindset. Collaborators are employable.
In our new economy … collaboration is king!
Global and cultural awareness
Our global economy makes cross-cultural awareness a sought after attribute. Being able to work effectively 
in different linguistic or cultural settings – and in groups of different generations and team members of 
varied skills, working styles and values – is more than marketable.
Of course, not all of us are good at every skill set listed above. The secret is to “sell” what you’re good 
at now – and articulate a willingness to learn those skills not yet mastered. Most important, you must 
convincingly show how your skill set will solve the employer’s problems — those that must be solved 
now and also over the long-term.

What do employers really want?
Next time you interview for an internship, or a job at the end of your internship, and the interviewer 
says, “Tell me about you…?” – instead of telling them where you live, went to school or about your 
family, start with this list of skills and mindsets. 
In other words, show the employer what they really want to see!

How to find your internship
5	 How to find your internship
5.1	 Choosing the right internship for you
There are many factors involved with choosing the right internship for you including your degree, chosen 
career path, the availability of mentors and so much more. 
Here are some ideas on what to include on your internship wish list:
Your host company
Do you want to work for a big company or perhaps a small company or start-up? Do you care if you 
are an anonymous “Intern X” – or would you prefer to develop relationships with every person in your 
office? Figure out what your internship host company should be like, in a fair amount of detail, and put 
your wishes on the list.
Paid vs. unpaid?
Are you willing to accept – and can you afford – an unpaid internship? Is course credit enough for 
you? If yes, what funds will pay for those credits? Do you need to earn money to pay living expenses 
or transportation costs?
These are tough questions, but in this economy they are some of the most important…for everyone.
In the UK, you are entitled by law to be paid for your internship if you have a contract of employment. 
Without one, students take a risk with their legal rights to fair treatment. Employers take the risk they 
won’t be sued either by a student (for pay), a customer (for something done by the student in the name 
of the employer) or prosecuted by the tax man (for breaking the law).

How to find your internship
In the US, there are no national “laws” regarding unpaid internships. However, organizations are supposed 
to follow the guidelines established in what has become known as the “6 Prong Test” from the Department 
of Labor’s (DOL) Fair Labor Standard Act (FLSA):
1.	 The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is 
similar to training which would be given in an educational environment; 
2.	 The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern; 
3.	 The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of 
existing staff; 
4.	 The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities 
of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded; 
5.	 The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship; and 
6.	 The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time 
spent in the internship.
The reality is, however:
• There are no direct consequences for employers who fail to comply with this “Test” (again, 
these are guidelines, not law)
• The DOL has no enforcement capabilities; the only cases that come to their attention are 
driven by complaints by interns (or the attorneys that represent them)
• Few interns complain for fear they may risk their reputation and/or careers
So, what is an intern to do?
Make the right choice for you. While we at YouTern and The Employability Hub advocate paid internships, 
the fact is that many paid internships are terrible educational experiences; they lack mentorship, direction 
and career value. On the other hand, many former interns feel their unpaid internships were the difference 
maker to their careers…and wouldn’t trade the experience for anything.
The real key, no matter where you live and work:  
never let yourself be exploited as unpaid labor
Your time is valuable; so is a good employer’s. As you look at every opportunity 
to intern, ensure the relationship is beneficial for all sides – and expectations 
are properly set and maintained.

How to find your internship
Career-focused or career diversity?
Do you want to work for a company 100% dedicated to your chosen career field? Or are you okay 
working for an industry-related department of a company? For example, if you are an engineer…do you 
want to work for an engineering company, or would you instead consider working for the Engineering 
Department of say, Disney? You might also consider an internship in a widely-used and wildly-popular 
industry like healthcare or social/digital media?
Perhaps most important: being open to working at different types of companies might provide more 
internship opportunities from which to choose.
Virtual vs. in-office
Do you want to commute to an office or work from home? In the digital age, some companies find team 
members work just as effectively from home, in the library or at Starbucks. Communication through 
conference calls or via email and Skype make being in the same physical location, unnecessary.
Especially if you are not from an urban area like New York, London or Silicon Valley where 
many internships are available  
…being open to a virtual internship means more opportunity.

How to find your internship
Mentor or supervisor?
Do you want a mentor – someone who actively promotes your learning process (see chapter 8) during 
the internship? Or do you instead prefer a supervisor who lets you learn on your own…and also provides 
a little direction when it may be needed?
Some companies take pride in offering mentors for their interns. At many companies, a supervisor is 
also the mentor. He or she answers the intern’s questions, gives them guidance and offers suggestions 
to help advance their learning – while also expecting the intern to self-learn through experience and 
even mistakes.
Think about what type of guidance you want, and need.
What culture is best for you?
Do you like structure, rules and rigidity typically associated with larger companies, well established non-
profits and the government? Or do you prefer a more laid back, relaxed, go-with-the-flow environment 
often found in smaller businesses, start-ups and grass-roots non-profits?
Deciding which culture fits your personality best is important so you may thrive during your internship. 
Not sure what fits you best? Try one of each!
How far will you travel?
Are you okay with commuting? If yes, how far are you willing to travel…15 minutes each way…or maybe 
an hour or more every day?
A longer commute tolerance may open a wider range of opportunities. At the same time, sitting in traffic 
or on a train is a financial drain, as well as a quality of life consideration. Think honestly about how 
you feel about your potential commute – because what might sound tolerable during the interview can 
become a major stress point during the internship.
5.2	 Finding the right internships: old-school
Many of the traditional means of finding internships still exist, even if they aren’t as productive as they 
once were.
Career centers
Your on-campus career center should be one of your first stops on campus…as early as your first 
week, freshman year. Surveys consistently indicate that not nearly enough students visit their career 
center…or know how they can help.

How to find your internship
Yes, some career centers have reputations for not assisting students as much as they could, or for lacking 
actionable, contemporary career advice. However, no matter how old-school your career center may be, 
it likely offers many positive assets – including amazing contacts with local employers.
Thankfully, not all career centers fall into the old-school category; in fact, many are now staffed with 
highly capable, knowledgeable, passionate professionals ready to help you with your internship search. 
They will help you learn how best to network, to leverage social media, build effective career collateral 
and hone your interview skills. 
Bottom line: network with the professionals in your career center!  
Walk in with an open-mind and a positive attitude.
Job boards
Large job boards like Monster, Craigslist and Internships.com used to be the best way to find an internship, 
or job. Today, their impact has greatly diminished as more and more positions are filled via networking, 
social media and referrals. Also working against the big job boards: the frustrating candidate experience. 
Many internship seekers tell stories of following the process exactly as expected – sometimes applying 
to hundreds of positions – and never getting a call back. Additionally, there are many stories of less-
than-reputable employers and postings on the big boards; some observers estimate as many as 30% of all 
big job board postings do not represent legitimate internship opportunities. Surely, this is not where all 
your time should be spent…and your expectations should be set according to results seen by your peers.
We should also add that there are exceptions to the “job boards don’t work” rule. Most notably are 
IdeaList.org and YouTern, which has a small job board where every post is vetted for legitimacy and 
the availability of a mentor.
Employer web sites
Postings on employer web sites are still a terrific resource for research, networking and availability of 
open internships. 
Just remember: resist temptation to blindly look for open internships on companies’ career pages. Instead, 
first build a personal employer target list – a thoroughly researched list of 10 companies you would really 
like to work for – and maintain your focus on that list. Do your homework first!
The real secret to success found by using these old-school internship search tools:  
Use them as just one of many tools in your toolbox…don’t count on them exclusively 
to help you find your internship opportunity.

5.3	 Internship Service Bureaus
Niche internship placement organizations, some independent and others sponsored by employers, are 
springing to meet the demand of both students/graduates and employers. 
These agencies match you with an employer and internship opportunity, some also providing resume/
CV advice (including video profiles). Examples include London-based Inspiring Interns, who have a hit 
rate of 65% of their interns securing a job as a result of their internship.
If you want to find out about positive or negative experiences from interns, check out internship rating sites 
such as Glassdoor.com, InternshipRatings.com and RatemyPlacement.co.uk, which act like TripAdvisor 
for internships, enabling you to see what the experience may really be like.
5.4	 Leveraging Social Media
Right now, you may view social media only as a social tool with which to connect with friends and 
relatives. In reality, social media can be a huge asset in your internship search by enabling you to expand 
your network and share your voice as you pursue that first job after graduation.
As our friend Lea McLeod of Degrees of Transitions, a career expert who specializes in assisting near- or 
recent-graduates transition into the workforce, points out so well:

How to find your internship
The value of social media as you start your career search is three-fold:
• You can immediately connect with professionals, organizations, mentors and career experts
• A well-managed social media presence enables employers to easily find and identify you 
• You are able to monitor your online presence and control, to the best of your ability, content 
related to your personal brand
The key to finding an internship via social media is that you must have a clear strategy and carefully manage 
the time you spend on the online platforms. Without a plan, social media can become a timesuck…and 
you won’t have much to show for your investment.
What Lea provides below is not intended to be an exhaustive list of everything you can do in a social 
media search. However, the points represent some great ideas for beginner to intermediate levels of 
social media expertise. Of course, don’t do them all at once. Begin with one platform, get comfortable 
with how you’ll use that element to help you find an internship, and then move to the next.
Soon, you’ll be a social media job search expert!
Facebook
We’re going to start with what you probably know best: Facebook. Statistically, it’s likely you have a decent 
sized network on Facebook. Why not leverage the network you already have first?
Shout out to your friends and family
Let your existing friends know exactly what kind of internship you hope to find and what organizations 
you aspire to work for. Ask who they know that they could introduce you to. After all, these are folks 
who already know you, presumably have some level of trust in you and who could easily refer you.
Build your BranchOut profile
Download this Facebook app that allows you to build a “professional” presence and leverage your existing 
friends’ network. Upload a work-appropriate head shot and build your profile. Because it’s walled off 
from your personal profile, you can connect to others and network professionally. You can also browse 
internship postings, apply, and see how you’re connected to those posting the internships.

How to find your internship
Follow companies, industry influencers and career experts
Follow your target companies on fan pages, or subscribe to feeds from career search or industry experts. 
This is a great way to keep up with employer branding, product trends, communication styles and much 
more.
Manage your privacy settings
As we all know by now, employers are checking you out online, before they even contact you. Be smart 
about what’s available to the public, and what only your friends can see. Make this an immediate priority. 
LinkedIn
At first, LinkedIn – the world’s most popular professional network – can be a bit intimidating. So start 
with the basics of LinkedIn and keep building on what you know already – and are doing to build your 
social media presence. 
Build your profile 
Include an attention-getting headline and summary statement. Use keywords that will attract the kind 
of employer, and internship, you are looking for. So the world can see your smiling face, include a 
professional, close-in head shot.

How to find your internship
Create your vanity URL
LinkedIn will allow you to define a URL unique to you which you can then include on your resume and 
other career-related materials. That way, when people look you up on LinkedIn, they’ll be sure to find 
your profile, and not someone else with the same or similar name.
Connect to everyone you know
Include your parents, parents of your friends, your friends, professors and basically anyone in your life 
who has a profile. Then build from there. 
With each invitation to connect, include a brief, personalized note introducing yourself;  
do not just send the generic connection invitation text LinkedIn provides
Follow your target companies
Use the ‘Companies’ feature in the LinkedIn search tab to follow organizations you believe are a good 
match for you. See what jobs are posted and who you’re connected to in those organizations so you can 
then pursue introductions.

How to find your internship
Investigate job postings and apply for jobs
On LinkedIn, you can see the skills and competencies employers seek…right in their job postings. This 
process also gets you familiar with the language they use (including keywords), enabling you to use this 
language as you prepare your personal marketing materials. Bonus: you can apply for jobs right from 
the site.
Identify new potential connections
Simply put, your connections can introduce you to their connections. Be sure you have a good 
introduction message and professional statement about why you would like to connect – and why they 
should help you.
Join groups; participate in conversations
LinkedIn Groups are an opportunity for you to make intelligent comments and observations, answer 
questions and make connections with influencers. Join groups where you have interests or connections, 
including alumni, career interests, Gen Y or millennial groups, job search, internships, associations or 
industry specific groups.
Twitter
Twitter is a way to have conversations with virtually anyone in the Twitterverse. And there’s no gatekeeper 
in sight. If you find someone who is intriguing or has a shared interest, you can speak directly to them, 
one on one, and they will most likely respond to you. 
To get started:
As Lea McLeod says, “Twitter is about more than keeping up with the Kardashians, or 
Macklemore.”
Build your profile
Building a profile on Twitter is much easier than LinkedIn, mostly because you are limited to 160 
characters for your entire bio. Include your interests, your goals, and your LinkedIn URL. Hint: look at 
the profiles of successful recent grads and your peers, even your competitors, to get some emulation ideas.
Develop a strategy 
Begin with the end in mind. Who do you want to connect with, and why? Perhaps you want to converse 
with people in your field and organizations of interest to you? What are the 10 target organizations you 
have or the top three industries you want to explore? Be strategic; network with purpose.

How to find your internship
Follow your strategy
Once you’ve identified the target companies and industries, follow the folks who represent and champion 
them. Re-tweet pertinent posts. Engage in conversation, make comments and ask good questions. Build 
a reputation…and get known!
Build lists
So you can easily organize and follow key influencers and contacts, use Twitter’s “List” feature. In one 
list you can have career search contacts; in other lists you can have your top 10 target companies and 
perhaps tweets from notables in your desired industry. These lists make it very easy to scan recent posts 
from your community, re-tweet them, and add your own perspective. Using lists will also save you 
valuable time – and keep you focused. 
Bonus tip: join Twitter chats
Twitter chats are online chats, usually at the same day and time each week. The chats are moderated 
by hosts who ask questions and facilitate the conversation. Twitter chats are a fun and fast-paced way 
to participate in a virtual conversation. You’ll meet new people and make more connections. Chats 
we suggest: #InternPro and #jobhuntchat on Mondays and #OMCChat (Open Mic Career Chat) on 
Thursdays.
Don’t let social media overwhelm you…and don’t allow it to be a timesuck. Find the best tools for you; 
stay focused and put them to work in your internship search.

5.5	 Network, network, network!
Many of us, even after setting up our social media profiles, do not consider networking a key element 
in an internship search strategy. However, the contacts in your network are much more likely to get 
you hired…
Get hired faster
Getting an interview is sometimes the hardest part about securing an internship. Knowing a current 
employee at that company, however, will – 9 times out of 10 in our new economy – dramatically increase 
your chance of getting an interview. 
Research from Jobvite found that “Employees hired through referral are  
hired 55% faster than those who come from a career site.”
Become an enthusiastic referral
John Muscarello, a blogger and networking evangelist, says: “I realized networking was going to play 
a big role in my job search after my mentor, Deirdre Breakenridge, shared that 85% of open positions 
are not posted online. Every single job I have found has been through a person who recommended me 
or told me about an opportunity.” Muscarello adds: “When my current employer is looking for a new 
employee, they always send around an email to the entire company asking for referrals.”

How to find your internship
This theory is supported by the current recruiting practices of many organizations:
• Big companies like Ernst & Young are increasingly using their own workers to find new 
hires, saving time and money. “…a referral puts them in the express lane,” said Larry Nash, 
Director of Experience and Executive Recruiting. “Indeed, as referred candidates get fast-
tracked, applicants from other sources like corporate web sites, internet job boards and job 
fairs sink to the bottom of the pile.”
• “You’re submitting your résumé to a black hole [online],” said John Sullivan, a human 
resources consultant. “You’re not going to find top performers at a job fair. Whether it’s fair 
or not, you need to have employees make referrals for you if you want to find a job”.
To become an employee referral, you must network!
Know people who know who’s hiring
Professionals who attend in-person networking events consistently have a good handle on what is 
happening; they know which companies are doing well, important events happening in the industry, 
and which companies are hiring. These influencers are nearly always willing to help new professionals 
in the industry; offer to take them out to coffee so that you can ask them more about the industry and 
what they currently do. 
By networking efficiently you will find a job faster than your competition. You’ll also build a 
substantial personal sphere of influence that will benefit you throughout your career!
5.6	 Create your own internship
Once you have your social media profiles built and have become comfortable with networking…go to 
the next level: creating your own internship. Here’s how:
1.	 Create a target list of 10 companies you would really like to work for today
2.	 Imagine an internship tailored to your strengths – what would that internship look like, and 
how would it benefit the employer? What problem will you solve as their intern?
3.	 Prepare a pitch specific to the employer on your target list best suited to you
4.	 Find a recruiter or hiring manager at one of your target companies and introduce yourself 
through LinkedIn, Twitter or by asking for an informational interview
5.	 Arrange a coffee meeting – just 15 minutes of their time
6.	 Sell your plan…and convince them they need you, your passion and your plan

How to find your internship
Used correctly, this tactic works amazingly well – especially in this economy. Rarely will an employer 
turn down an offer of help…and even if they do, you’ve just impressed a potential mentor and influential 
contact. 
Don’t wait for the perfect internship for you. Work with your career center. Peruse the job boards for leads 
and valuable keywords. Perhaps most important in today’s economy, build your social media presence 
and personal network. Then – using skills gained – create your own internship!

How do I know a good internship from bad?
6	 How do I know a good internship 
from bad?
Just like there are bad and good college courses, bad relationships and good…and both 
good and bad jobs  
…there are good and bad internships.
6.1	 Warning signs of a bad internship
So how do you know what is a good internship? Or if an internship opportunity (and an exploitive 
employer) is something you should walk away from at a quick pace?
It is easy to say how important it is to do your research before applying and accepting an internship. 
It is another consideration all together, however, to identify which employers take a professional and 
responsible approach to hiring interns – and which do not. 
Here are the “red flag” signs to watch out for, common among bad employers and bad internships:
Too good to be true
Unfortunately, there are many scams disguised as internships. The general rule of thumb, like many 
other aspects of your life: “If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.” Specifically, be aware of any 
organization that asks for your social security number before they’ve formally offered you a position, 
anyone who asks for passwords to your social media accounts and any request to invest your money in 
their organization.
Any hint of exploitation
Internships where you are disrespected, placed in unsafe conditions (physically or emotionally) or asked 
to compromise your ethics are the biggest red flags. However, exploitation can take many other forms, 
including an employer hiring you simply as “free labor”. Run away.
Improperly set expectations
From big picture and critical items such as responsibilities, assignments and milestones, all the way 
down to use of the cell phone, Facebook (in a non-social media role, of course) and dress code – your 
expectations must be properly set, from day one of the internship.

21st Century Internships

How do I know a good internship from bad?
Failure to teach
By definition, an internship is experiential education – an extension of what you learn in the classroom, 
with a real world spin. Far too many internships, even those where no other major negative issues exist, get 
rated much lower than expected because the intern says: “I had a great time, but I didn’t learn anything.”
Not facilitating a “mentor” relationship
Today’s interns aren’t looking for a go-fer job with someone barking orders and assigning menial tasks. 
You should crave a mentor from whom you can learn, and who, in return, takes an active interest in 
your professional growth – during, and perhaps also after, the internship.
Breakdown in communication and feedback
Like all team members, you can’t correct what you don’t know is wrong. Communication, both 
spontaneous and formal (on-board, mid-term and exit interviews, at a minimum), is critical to your 
internship experience – and by default places you in a “learning” environment that will greatly improve 
both your technical and soft skills.
Inability to confirm or deny a career choice
You may view your internship as a chance to try a career choice on for size – an opportunity to confirm, 
or deny, an interest in your chosen vocation. If at the end of the internship you have gained no significant 
insight, the internship will not be as productive as you’d hoped.
Lack of accountability and recognition
If your mentor shows no interest in holding you accountable for timely completion of tasks, and for 
co-managing your own internship, they are overlooking a fundamental (yet monumental in terms of 
learning) piece of a quality internship. Failing to recognize your hard work and contribution – especially 
when you have clearly exceeded expectations – is equally damning. The biggest red flag in this category: 
upfront refusal to supply a letter of recognition or referral at the end of the internship.
Failure to prepare (and being assigned busy work)
Instead of planning out your on-boarding and work a day or week ahead of time, and delegating tasks 
important to both the company and you, a supervisor will often assign “busy work” to get you “out of 
my hair” for a while. We guarantee this practice does not mean good things for you as intern.
Missed opportunity to network
As you view networking occurring among your mentors and colleagues – social media, lunches, 
networking meetings and Twitter chats – think: “Am I being included?” If not, it may be that your 
internship is not running at full steam.

21st Century Internships

How do I know a good internship from bad?
Unwillingness to listen
Internships in today’s market are proverbial “win-win” relationships – both the company and you benefit 
from the experience. If your goals and career aspirations are not integrated into the learning plan from 
the very beginning of the internship – the internship could be considered a failure.
Failure to compensate (and not just wages)
The authors strongly support paid internships. We also understand compensation comes in many forms 
other than an hourly wage. Stipends, performance-based bonuses, formal mentoring by an influencer, 
tangible elements for a portfolio, meaningful exposure to a C-level or board-level executive’s personal 
network, paid transportation and parking expenses, and lunches – all can be considered effective, and 
agreeable, forms of compensation. How will you be compensated? And what is acceptable to you?
6.2	 What to expect from a high-quality employer
Experiencing a well-run and credible internship with a well-regarded employer will add value to your 
resume/CV. Here is what you really ought to expect from a responsible employer before, during and 
after an internship:

How do I know a good internship from bad?
Before:
A good employer will take their responsibilities seriously. They understand they have a fantastic 
opportunity to shape and nurture the talent of an enthusiastic, unique talent who is aching to learn 
from them. In return they reap the rewards of all that potential for the good of their business and their 
customers. 
A good employer will develop, train, induct and brief your mentor so they are fully prepared for the job 
of nurturing you. They will pick the right person to be the mentor.
During:
An effective employer will stretch you so you get maximum experiential learning with a real world spin. 
They will support, coach and mentor you, they will find you opportunities. They hold regular reviews. 
They hold your mentor accountable. They champion and celebrate your successes. 
Worth repeating: From big picture and critical items such as responsibilities, assignments and milestones, 
all the way down to dress code and rules regarding personal use of the cell phone and Facebook – they 
will set expectations from day one of your internship. 
The employer’s mindset should be ‘how can I leverage your unique capabilities?’ not ‘what can I find 
for you to do?’

21st Century Internships
41 
How do I know a good internship from bad?
After:
An excellent employer will ask you to give the employer a testimonial, as well as write one for you! 
They will conduct an exit interview. They ask you to write up your internship experience, both good 
and bad. They will ask their regular employees to give their feedback regarding your performance and 
share it with you. 
Finally, an excellent employer will offer you a job if it’s right for both parties. If not, they will signpost 
you towards what they’re seeking or introduce you to their network. They help you learn to leap.
6.3	 What to expect from yourself
You are equally responsible for a high-quality, high-impact internship experience. Here’s what you should 
expect from yourself: 
Before:
Here are eight items you need to cross off your “I’m prepared” list in the days and weeks prior to starting 
your internship:
Read the latest company news and reports
Understand the successes and challenges of the industry, the company, their customers and major 
partners. Read up on any new product launches and customer reviews. The more you know, the better 
you can help the mission.
Research the company and team
Head to LinkedIn. Then research key employees and understand the structure of the company; anticipate 
who might be on your team. Make note of leaders, influencers and potential mentors with whom you 
may want to connect during the internship.
Brush up on your networking skills
Even when most are welcoming at your internship, it can be intimidating to network and engage with 
a bunch of people you’ve never met. So come fully armed – and be ready to extend a firm handshake 
and ask good questions.

21st Century Internships

How do I know a good internship from bad?
Make a list of objectives
What do you want to accomplish in this internship? Who do you want to meet? What business units or 
projects most interest you? Having this list will be a map for your development during your internship. 
Many managers are more than willing to give you experiences and opportunities…if you just know 
what, and who, you want to ask.
Get a new alarm clock
There is no worse first impression to make than being late. Many companies constantly evaluate interns 
for job fit, culture fit, leadership, responsibility and so many other characteristics…and punctuality is at 
the top of that list. Put your best foot forward every day, by showing up early.
Research current job openings
Many companies have internships that don’t align to an exact match in a full-time position. Assuming 
you want an offer at the end of the internship, take the time to look through their career site. If you 
find something interesting, find out more about that job, manager, and department. If it’s a more senior 
position, make it your goal to find a manager to explain the career path into that type of job.

How do I know a good internship from bad?
Know your strengths…and your weaknesses
It is extremely important to know your strengths and how you can leverage them; however, it is equally 
important to know your current limits. Everyone has them. Know what areas in which you need 
development and be open to help yourself grow.
Plan to have fun
Every good manager knows everyone needs some fun once in a while. If you’re invited to lunch with a 
new acquaintance – go. If you’re invited to play a quick round of football in the break room with your 
team member – do it. This doesn’t show that you’re lazy – it shows that you fully embrace the culture of 
the organization. Don’t try to burn yourself out – don’t always work through lunch just to prove you can.
During:
There are do’s and there are don’ts that will help you keep your internship and get the most out of it for 
your personal development and career success. Here are helpful tips for getting the most out of your 
internship while at work:
DO
DON’T
Communicate
You are going to be judged on your written and verbal 
communication skills. If you’re ready for the big time, show 
off a bit. If your professional communication skills need a 
little work, find a mentor to assist your efforts to learn.
Yak on the phone
It’s okay to take a few personal calls during the 
workday (although it’s important to abide by proper 
office phone etiquette). When your personal life starts 
to conflict with what you should be doing at work, 
however, you may be talking too much.
Google everything
Anyone who tells you there is no such things as a stupid 
question has never heard of “Google”. Rather than wasting 
a colleague’s, mentor’s or supervisor’s valuable time, take a 
minute first to self-learn. If Google doesn’t get it done, try 
LinkedIn groups, Quora, a help-desk or an industry forum to 
find your answers.
Surf the internet
We’re all guilty of checking our personal email from 
time to time – or taking a break to read a funny meme 
or article. However, spending excessive time surfing 
websites irrelevant to your job will likely get you into 
trouble. Try to save Facebook or online shopping for 
after work, and never visit adult sites during working 
hours.
Be a champion
Intentionally, and sincerely, champion the work of co-
workers, customers and vendors. Call it karma if you will, 
but this is a terrific way to create a solid reputation.
Be a gossip
Gossip can hurt company morale, and you. Do 
everything possible to avoid spreading rumors or 
belittling others. Stay away from idle chatter that 
could potentially endanger your internship.
Be likeable
Never underestimate the power of being humble, positive 
and empathetic. Your co-workers will appreciate the 
uplifting attitude; your mentors and bosses will notice your 
genuine enthusiasm and your smile.
Be a drama queen
With every team trying to do more with less, there 
simply isn’t time for timesucks like drama queens, 
victims, divas and trolls. If you feel like complaining, 
do it off-hours on Facebook, like everyone else (just 
don’t complain about work!)

How do I know a good internship from bad?
DO
DON’T
Network
The more you network, the more value you gain from the 
internship experience. Build relationships that not only 
benefit you and the company now…but also long after the 
internship is over.
Date co-workers
Companies have different policies regarding dating 
co-workers, so make sure you know the company 
rules. You don’t want to get involved in a fling that will 
cost you your date money.
General Rule
Don’t be afraid to make mistakes…just be ready to fail fast.
General Rule
If you have to think twice about something…don’t do 
it once
After:
Here are some helpful tips for ensuring you walk away from your internship having given yourself the 
best chance of nailing an excellent referral, or perhaps a job offer:
• When your internship is nearing its end, meet with your mentor or supervisor to discuss 
your achievements and progress
• Get feedback on what you did well and the areas you could develop further
• Record your successes , activities, skills used and knowledge gained, including testimonials
• Send an email or letter thanking your mentor, supervisor and colleagues for their support; 
connect with them on social media, especially LinkedIn
• Obtain a reference for future jobs – from as many mentors and other sources as possible
Finally, it is simply not enough to sit back and bask in the satisfaction of a great internship 
experience. In our ultra-competitive job market, you simply must leverage the benefits 
gained – and be able to demonstrate your new-found skills to that employer…or a 
potential employer in the future.
So what can you do to ensure you don’t lose momentum? Bank your gains by recording them along the 
way! Keep an activity and reflective learning journal so you can:
• Note when you learned a new skill, exceeded expectations or met a new influencer or a 
potential mentor
• Revisit your resume/CV; add examples – quantified, if possible – of when you demonstrated 
the relevant skills and attitudes mentioned in chapter 4
• Explain how you met challenges and difficulties, what worked in overcoming them and how 
you might do things differently next time
Go into every internship knowing that to get ahead in your career, you must be able to show the impact 
you had on each company you worked for!

An internship with a small team
7	 An internship with a small team
Internships at start-ups, small businesses and grass-roots non-profits offer unique advantages over their 
corporate and large-scale counterparts. Interns often have more responsibility, are exposed to a wider 
range of business functions, and many receive more one-on-one mentoring than often takes place at 
large corporations. Perhaps most important, many small team interns work directly with, and learn from, 
company founders, owners and directors. 
Start-up internships present unique challenges as well: longer hours, perhaps; the expectation of being a 
problem solver and leader almost immediately; and working directly with, and learning from, company 
founders, owners and directors.
Intimidated? Not you!
You choose to intern in a small team environment because of your confidence and adventurous, 
entrepreneurial spirit, right? Executives are just people, like everyone else, right?
In some ways you are correct; executives are just people. More than that, they’re people who want to see 
interns succeed. In fact, they need their interns to succeed – and to contribute to the company’s success. 
There is simply no room for dead weight in a start-up trying to make it big, a small business trying to 
hang in with much larger competitors or an under-funded non-profit.

An internship with a small team
In other ways, however, you’ll need to adapt – fast – to thrive (or sometimes even to survive) as a small 
team intern. Here are some simple suggestions on interning effectively at a small team:
Remember, executives are busy
The average small team executive is typically under pressure that would crack a diamond. While working 
hard to keep the organization afloat, they juggle many responsibilities – funding, technology, sales, 
customer service, PR…the list goes on.
Your communication with executives should keep this environment in mind. For instance, save 
elaborate preamble and set-ups with long introductions for academic papers; while professors love that 
communication style, start-up executives need quick delivery of important points. Concisely provide 
the pertinent information, and you’re done. (But have supporting data at hand if asked for more detail).
Represent yourself professionally – always
Even when executives wear shorts to the office, buy drinks at company celebrations or work the BBQ 
at lunch…they’re still executives. Fit in, of course, but don’t get too casual. Your mentors are not your 
buddies – at least not yet.
In the start-up environment, specifically you are being evaluated all the time, in every situation. Start-
ups can’t afford hiring mistakes. They must move fast, so they often hire exceptional interns directly to 
permanent positions. Every move you make should represent you as a capable, dedicated professional – 
and a potential team member.
Create your own feedback loop
In school, you receive feedback and evaluation through tests and grades. It’s great because your progress 
is calculated for you; results are provided on a regular basis. Executives and directors, however, are often 
too busy to review your projects every day, or even every week. 
You’ll need to ramp up quickly, and work independently. That’s not to say that you shouldn’t expect 
feedback on your work. Rather, it means you may have to help create the opportunity to receive input 
from your mentor.
Suggest a schedule of feedback meetings; perhaps half-hour, bi-weekly discussions to chart your progress 
and review your assignments. Before each meeting, email an agenda to your mentor with the main 
discussion points. Bring your view of progress made on your assignments, and be prepared to discuss 
any roadblocks or issues encountered. If you’ve completed your assignments, ask for new ones – and 
have suggestions ready.

An internship with a small team
Take initiative
There may be times when your assignments are done, or stalled. As an intern you can’t always just make 
up your own – and are left with free time. This is the perfect time to log into your Facebook account and 
check status updates, or discuss your latest exploits with friends on Twitter, right? 
Wrong! As an intern, you have two main responsibilities:
1.	 Learn as much as you can from your assignments (and by watching what it takes to run a 
company)
2.	 Working with the team to the best of your ability
When you find yourself with free time, be productive. Outline a new project or value-add; learn something 
new from a co-worker; document your work in your journal. Or perhaps research and evaluate your 
industry and your company’s competition.
Unless social media is a defined role within your internship 
…save it for your off time.
Interning directly with executives at a small team represents a fantastic opportunity for your early career. 
No doubt, the challenges you face will be daunting – and you may feel some of that executive pressure 
too. However, the rewards – and the education – will be that much greater, too.

The role of mentoring
8	 The role of mentoring
The most successful and transformational internships involve a genuine mentor-mentee relationship. 
A mentor takes pride in introducing you to the workplace … mentors matter.
We all find ourselves needing the wise guidance of someone else to help us make important transitions 
at various life stages. Having a mentor, or several mentors, will make a huge difference throughout your 
professional life…but perhaps never more so than during your role as an intern.
Sometimes we learn best from someone who has been there, done that…and got the t-shirt.

The role of mentoring
A tennis player, for example, may need someone else beyond the narrow area of improving technique or 
physical conditioning – someone with a wider, longer-term perspective – for advice on attitude, match 
strategy, the game plan or long-term career. The mentor is likely to be an experienced tennis player in 
the past, someone with credibility in the eyes of the mentee. 
When you don’t know what you don’t know, a mentor gives you the benefit of their experiences; they 
open your eyes to new possibilities or ways forward. They can say what has worked or not worked for 
them because they have been in that situation, job or role.
Of course, you still decide what choices to make, which direction to go. The mentor just helps you see 
all possibilities and pitfalls.
As a mentee, how do you ensure you get the best out of that relationship? What can help you to be 
a brilliant mentee?
8.1	 What being a good mentee means
A mentor is usually not paid for their efforts. They work with you based on the potential they see in you. 
Here are some tips on how to be the best possible mentee – and earn the continued support of your 
mentors:
1.	 Maintain a positive view of yourself
2.	 Have faith and trust in the mentor
3.	 Be willing to discuss issues openly
4.	 Share with your mentor how you feel the relationship is working
5.	 Accept challenge willingly
6.	 Recognize the constructive intent of feedback
7.	 Be active in your own development, not dependent on the mentor
8.	 Take a few risks in order to make progress
9.	 Think about other ways to develop outside of mentoring
10.	Be willing to openly discuss the end of the relationship when the time comes
8.2	 How a good mentoring process can help you
Having a mentor, or a stable of mentors – otherwise known as a “personal board of directors” – provides 
many benefits, including:
1.	 Objective information, clarity and reassurance
2.	 An overview of your role and perhaps your performance
3.	 Development of marketable skills

The role of mentoring
4.	 Recognition of achievement and learning
5.	 Support of your choice of options and decision-making
6.	 A sense of being supported
7.	 A reality check (sometimes referred to as “tough love”)
8.	 A role model
9.	 Growth, personally and professionally
“The need for business mentoring is particularly needed in the current economic 
situation, especially among recent graduates looking for entry-level positions.
There is a clear need for career progression and development, i.e. moving beyond 
securing a job placement role. An emphasis on graduate development programs by 
employers is not enough to nurture new talents especially when too much focus 
is placed on educational qualifications and less on equipping graduates with 
the required skill sets to excel in a given work environment or industry. 
Although it might be argued that one leads to another,  
business productivity will definitely benefit from mentoring.”
Augustus Chinedu Emenogu, Young Leaders and International Student Mentor
8.3	 Real life benefits of mentorship
Taken from a workshop run by the authors, here are some real-life benefits a mentor can bring you, as 
well as the impact the positive behaviors had on the lives and careers of the mentees:
MENTOR Behavior
MENTEE Impact
Acted as a mirror; reflected different view of same 
image
Effected change in my growth as a person; considered 
long-term impact
Challenged me; gave me honest feedback
Enabled me to accept criticism
Gentle guidance; helped me refocus
Stopped repeating unhelpful behaviors
Shoulder to lean on
Greatly increased personal confidence
Opened my mind to what I could do for myself
Ownership and motivation; I wouldn’t be where I am 
today
Invested time in me; always available
Felt far more valued
Genuinely there for me; no conflicts of interest; treated 
me like an equal
Became more open-minded to future mentoring
Set example; imparted perspective
Made different decisions; identified and seized 
opportunities
Being mentored well is one of life’s great experiences – and is an absolutely critical factor to those 
achieving success in the new economy.

9	 Using internships as a career 
compass
From a young age, we get asked:
• “What do you want to be when you grow up?”
• “Which college will you go to?”
• “What career do you want to pursue?”
Perhaps as a result, we put immense pressure on young people to choose a major/degree and a career, 
at a very early age. Yet, many of us end up with remarkably different careers than what we studied for; 
our passions often change.
Internships early in your college career are a fantastic means to immerse yourself in a career; to “test 
drive” your choice before you pursue it for real. The short-term nature of the typical internship is ideal 
for this try-out:

• If a profession isn’t what you want…you’re not only done with the internship in a few short 
months, you still have time to refocus your education and personal brand
• On the other hand, if the career direction is a good fit, you have time to take on several 
more internships – and meet many more influencers – in that industry before graduation
Some estimate we’ll have five to seven completely different careers in our lifetime.
One particular story brings this point home well:
A college junior, who – prompted by her love of animals – had known since she was the age of 12 she 
wanted to be a veterinary technician, got an internship at a large animal hospital. 
In those few work shifts, she quickly discovered that a veterinary technician doesn’t actually help 
animals…they clean up after them. And, they often end up helping dispose of the animals that don’t 
survive. Her heart was broken…in just a few days, her decade-long career dream was dashed. 
This story does have a happy ending…That intern ended up working at an animal shelter that saved 
pets from euthanasia. She changed her major/degree during the last year of school to focus more on 
non-profit and for-purpose business – and channeled her love of animals into a highly rewarding career 
(for her, and the pets!).
While not quite as dramatic, this type of story is repeated over and over again as young professionals 
enter the workforce. The engineer who just wanted job security finds out his passion is somewhere far 
from the world of semiconductors; the accounting major – who only went into accounting because that 
is what her parents wanted for her – changes focus after just one winter internship at a Big 4 firm.
Use internships as validation for your choices. Through completion of multiple internships, you will 
better decide what culture is best for you, what kind of a boss you appreciate most, and if virtual work 
suits you best. Or instead whether you would rather be in the office each day. Many young careerists 
even use internships to decide what part of the world they’d like to live in after graduation.
Never in your life will you have more flexibility. Never again will you have more freedom. The right 
internship can make many decisions more clear – and your future more focused.

Think of your internship as an extended job interview and probation period rolled into one. That means 
doing your preparation just as you would with any interview – and showing what you’re worth from the 
moment you are given the chance. Here are some tips to leverage your internship into a full-time job:
Tell them what you want
If you are serious about turning your internship into a full-time position, present this from the very 
beginning – perhaps during your first interview. If your employer is keen on the idea, then you’ve got 
yourself an amazing internship and job opportunity. If not, and a full-time gig is your ultimate goal, this 
internship may not be right for you.
Interview them
Remember that you’re testing the water with this company just as much as they are testing you. Take 
advantage of the internship to see if you can spot bad company culture before you get excited about 
working full-time. On the other hand, if you find that you love the working environment, you’ll have 
all the more motivation to do your absolute best.

Write everything down
Take the initiative and, as previously described, track and update all of the milestones and tasks you 
complete as they are assigned and enter them in your journal or smartphone. At the end of the internship, 
this will come in handy when you make your case to become a full-time hire. This tangible record will 
serve as both proof of the value you’ve added to the company and motivation for yourself to continue 
adding valuable accomplishments to the list throughout your internship. And…all this hard data and 
the success stories will help your resume/CV look amazing!
Be a sponge; remain positive
Your boss and co-workers realize you’re an intern, and you’re not expected to know how to do everything 
that’s assigned to you. Take advantage of this short period in your life when it’s okay to ask questions 
about the basics. Absorb all of your surroundings. If you make a mistake, don’t let it get you down. Stay 
positive, and remember that employers may judge you by how you react to the mistake…rather than 
the mistake itself.
Act like a full-time employee
Even though you may be the newest member of the team, be confident in your abilities; cordially talk to 
everyone at the company like you’re here to stay. If you like the company culture, show it by immersing 
yourself in the company outings and socials. Small-talking with your co-workers while waiting in line 
for your morning coffee will slowly build relationships, and it’ll be nice to see their congratulatory smile 
when you hopefully tell them the good news of your full-time hire.
Schedule a face-to-face
As you near the end of the internship period, schedule a meeting with your employer to talk about 
your performance and possibilities of continuing your employment at the company. Bring your list of 
accomplishments, and show them exactly how you’ve proven yourself valuable.
Keep your connections
If you haven’t already, no matter what the outcome of your internship, make sure you keep in touch 
with all of the connections you’ve made at this internship. Add everyone you’ve worked with and met 
on LinkedIn, and make sure to send them a quick hello from time-to-time to keep the contact fresh.
Don’t rush any decisions
If you receive a full-time offer, remember you are not obligated to take the offer…or at least the first offer. 
If the company is not a good fit, be appreciative of the offer, but realize you can take your newfound 
experience to a culture that better fits you…or perhaps hold out for the next offer.

Be sure to research your market value by comparing salaries at various companies to similar job titles 
with your level of experience. Be honest and sincere about this – because if you counter-offer with a 
number above what you know you’re worth, you could lose the offer altogether.
Keep these tips in mind – and your next career transition just may be from intern to full-time employee!

We know that 9 out of 10 direct-from-higher education hires in the US, and just slightly less in the UK, go 
to those with internship experience on their resumes/CVs. We also know that to even be considered for an 
internship (let alone a job) at many high-profile companies (Google and AOL, for example) an applicant 
must already have 3 or 4 internships under their belt.
We know employers look for entry-level talent with real-world experience  
…yet only 40% of candidates bother to get even one internship?
If you want a real job, at a real company, within your chosen career field…complete at least one high-
impact internship for every year you’re in higher education. Start early – or now – and capitalize on the 
opportunities your campus offers.
To get ahead, we must lose the “internships are not mandatory” mindset. 
We must compete.
Today, the career preparation process is as much a part of being a higher education student as going to 
lectures and writing academic papers. These are competitive times, and today’s college student needs to 
be much savvier about preparing for that transition from academics to career.
