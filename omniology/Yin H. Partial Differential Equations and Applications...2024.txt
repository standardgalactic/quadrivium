Preface
Mathematical modeling and analysis is the core of applied mathematics. Ordinary 
Differential Equations (ODE) and Partial Differential Equations (PDE) are the main 
tools used to establish various continuous models in biological, ecological and health 
sciences, various engineering fields, and natural as well as physical sciences. Some 
continuous and stochastic models in modern economics, finance, and social sciences 
are also built up by employing ordinary differential and partial differential equations. 
Moreover, when a set of data is large, a continuous mathematical model is more 
appropriate than a discrete model. On the other hand, the theory of partial differ­
ential equations has its own intrinsic interest and it connects many research fields 
in mathematical sciences such as differential geometry, complex analysis, harmonic 
analysis, functional analysis, and many more. It is an emerging need for students and 
researchers to have some basic knowledge in partial differential equations and some 
advanced tools to deal with challenging problems arising from different fields.
This is the main motivation for the current textbook. During the past three decades 
I have taught an advanced course in applied mathematics and courses in partial dif­
ferential equations at different levels. In addition to senior and graduate students in 
the mathematical sciences in my class, there was a large number of graduate students 
from the college of engineering as well as other departments with different majors 
who took these courses without an advanced mathematical background. For a long 
time I could not find a suitable textbook that could be used to satisfy the needs of 
both groups of students. I had to select different topics to motivate students to study 
the theory of partial differential equations and applications.
This textbook serves as a bridge for this group of students and researchers from 
different disciplines and backgrounds. Students do not need to have advanced math­
ematical knowledge (for example, of concepts such as Lebesgue measure theory and 
functional analysis) to understand the materials in this book. The book begins with 
elementary materials in partial differential equations, which covers the basic heat 
equation, wave equation, and the Laplace equation (Chapter 4 to Chapter 6 and par­
tial materials in Chapters 7, 8, and 9). Then it moves onto the materials in research 
frontiers (several sections in Chapter 7 to Chapter 9). One of the distinguishing 
features of the book is that I emphasize the modeling process for every physical 
problem discussed in the book. I give a very detailed step-by-step process to build 
up each mathematical model, based on physical and experimental laws. Students and 
researchers can extend these ideas and tools to establish more complicated models in 
their own research fields.
I hope that students in mathematical-science majors can use the theory and meth­
ods in this book as a starting point to study partial differential equations at a more 
advanced theoretical level. On the other hand, for students and researchers in differ­
ent fields, they can use the theory and techniques to investigate research topics in 
their own fields.

Preface
This textbook is based on the lectures I used for different courses at the Uni­
versity of Toronto, the University of Notre Dame, and Washington State University. 
The central theme of the text is to introduce basic concepts and techniques in partial 
differential equations for students without much advanced knowledge other than ad­
vanced calculus and elementary differential equations. An instructor can cover most 
materials in a one-semester course, with the option to cover more advanced materials 
in later courses as necessary.
Here is a brief of outline of the book:
In Chapter 1 we introduce basic concepts about partial differential equations. 
Many of these concepts are similar to those of ordinary differential equations. We 
then discuss the central questions of well-posedness and ill-posedness for a PDE 
problem. These questions are much more complicated than those encountered in 
ordinary differential equations. We present a number of counterexamples to illus­
trate why these questions are important and difficult to answer for partial differential 
equations. To motivate students’ interest in the subject, we present many important 
examples arising in pure and applied fields, including fundamental systems in fluid 
mechanics, electromagnetic fields, material sciences, and biological, ecological, and 
health sciences. One section in this chapter is devoted to the classification of second- 
order PDEs, which explains why we only focus on three classes of PDEs.
In Chapter 2 we introduce Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces, which serves as 
either an introduction or a review for students with different levels of mathematical 
background. In this chapter we focus only on classical function spaces, describing 
other spaces (such as Sobolev spaces) in the Appendix. The purpose of these ad­
vanced mathematical concepts is to extend results from finite-dimensional vector 
spaces in linear algebra into infinite-dimensional function spaces. These ideas form 
the foundation for various methods and techniques we develop later in the book. One 
section of this chapter is devoted to classical Fourier series, which we use to find 
series solutions for various equations. In the rest of the chapter we introduce several 
methods that will be used to deal with solvability for a PDE problem. This includes 
a powerful contraction mapping principle. As an application, we show how the prin­
ciple can be used to deal with systems of ODEs and integral equations.
In Chapter 3 we first study the eigenvalue problems in one dimension (the Sturm- 
Liouville theory). We then extend the idea into higher dimensions. In particular, we 
investigate under what conditions a set of functions can form a basis for a function 
space and how a function can be expressed in terms of basis functions. This general­
izes the classical Fourier series in one dimension into higher dimensions.
Chapter 4 to Chapter 6 deal with three types of basic equations: the heat equa­
tion, the wave equation, and the Laplace equation. For each chapter, we begin with a 
detailed derivation of the model equation as well as initial and boundary conditions. 
Then, we find the series solution from one-space dimension to higher-space dimen­
sions. We present many examples to illustrate basic methods and ideas for those PDE 
problems. The theoretical question about the well-posedness of the problem is inves­
tigated in the following sections. We also study the long-term behavior of solutions 
for the time-dependent problems. We deduce the precise decay rates for the solutions

of the heat equation and the wave equation. The maximum principle is a powerful tool 
for investigating nonlinear equations usually not covered in a PDE course for under­
graduate students; instead, we use an elementary approach to show the principle and 
then employ the principle to demonstrate several applications.
In Chapter 7 we introduce the Fourier-transform method. The method is a pow­
erful way to deal with PDE problems in infinite domains. As an application, we use 
the method to find solutions for the Cauchy problem associated with each class of 
equations. We present a number of examples throughout this chapter. One of the ap­
plications is to derive the explicit formula for the price of a European call option. We 
also include a more advanced section designed for advanced graduate students in the 
mathematical sciences.
In Chapter 8 we introduce the fundamental solutions for the Laplace and the heat 
equations. We use an elementary methodology to derive the explicit solution rep­
resentation for these equations in the whole space. We then use the fundamental 
solutions to construct Green’s functions for both types of equations. Green’s func­
tions are important for many applications such as boundary-element methods in 
numerical analysis. The rest of the materials about finite-time blowup and extinc­
tion are more advanced, and are optional for instructors. These materials are usually 
covered in advanced PDE courses. We present some of the results in this chapter to 
show students complicated dynamics when dealing with nonlinear equations.
Chapter 9 deals with a system of first-order partial differential equations. Again, 
we use the transportation model and Maxwell’s system as part of the motivation. 
A new method called the characteristic method is introduced to find a solution for the 
system of PDEs. We establish global existence and uniqueness based on the charac­
teristic method.

1.1 Introduction
Mathematical modeling and analysis plays a central role in scientific research and in­
dustrial applications. The basic approach in deriving a mathematical model is based 
on data-driven simulations, statistical patterns, and experimental and physical laws. 
Mathematical models can be broadly divided into discrete type and continuous type. 
When the data set for a problem is large, a continuous model for the problem is more 
appropriately used than a discrete version. These continuous models are typically 
governed by differential equations and systems. This is particularly true in biologi­
cal and ecological systems, population dynamics, health and medical sciences, fluid 
mechanics, heat conduction, wave propagation, electromagnetism, and other physi­
cal sciences. More recently, continuous models are also used in modern economics, 
finance, and social sciences. We will see many examples throughout this book.
1.1.1 Basic conceptions of partial differential equations
An equation involving an unknown function of one variable and its derivative is called 
an ordinary differential equation (ODE). A partial differential equation (PDE) is an 
equation involving an unknown function of several variables and its partial deriva­
tives. A system of ODEs or PDEs consists of more than one ODE or PDE. The 
highest order of a partial derivative in a PDE is called the order of the equation.
When a mathematical model governed by an ODE or PDE is established, one 
needs to find an unknown function (called the solution) and its properties. This leads 
to a general question of how to find a solution for an ODE or PDE problem and to 
analyze the solution of the problem. This book is devoted to this central question. We 
will introduce various methods and techniques of how to solve a PDE problem and 
to analyze the solution.
Suppose u(x, t) is a function with two variables x and t . We denote by ux and 
ut , respectively, the partial derivatives with respect to x and t. Suppose a physical 
model can be described by an unknown function u(x , t) that satisfies the following 
equation:
ut(x,t) — ux(x,t) = x2 +12, 
0 <x< 1 ,t > 0. 
(1.1.1)
Naturally, the goal is to find u(x, t) that satisfies Eq. (1.1.1).

CHAPTER 1 Basics of partial differential equations
Let us see some other classical examples:
ut - k2 uxx + 3u = sin(x + t), 
0 <x< 1,t >0, 
(1.1.2)
Utt — c uxx + u = cos t, x c R ,t > 0, 
(1.1.3)
Ut + uux = t e , x c R ,t > 0, 
(1.1.4)
where k and c are positive constants.
By definition, Eq. (1.1.1) and Eq. (1.1.4) are first-order PDEs, while Eq. (1.1.2) 
and Eq. (1.1.3) are second-order PDEs. A solution of a PDE is a function U(x , t) that 
satisfies the PDE in the classical sense. Sometimes, a solution U(x, t) may not exist 
in the classical sense, such as a shock-wave solution. To understand such a solution, 
one needs to extend the concept of classical derivative, called a “weak derivative”. 
The study for a generalized solution (weak solution) is one of the major topics in 
advanced PDE courses.
1.1.2 Linear and nonlinear, homogeneous, and nonhomogeneous 
PDEs
Similar to an ordinary differential equation (ODE), it is often convenient to use an 
operator notation to express a PDE. For example, we denote by L the following partial 
differential operator 
d d 
dt — dx,
then Eq. (1.1.1) can be written as
L[U] = x2 + t2,
(x, t) c (0, 1) X [0, ^).
Eq. (1.1.2) can be expressed as 
L[U] = sin(x + t),
0 <x<1,t >0,
where
d
L = — 
dt
k2 dx2+3
Definition 1.1.1. APDE,L[U]=f, is said to be linear if for any smooth functions 
U1, U2 and any constants k1, k2, the following identity holds:
L[k1U1 + k2U2] = k1L[U1] + k2L[U2].
Otherwise, it is said to be a nonlinear PDE.
For example, Eq. (1.1.1) and Eq. (1.1.2) are linear equations, while Eq. (1.1.3) 
and Eq. (1.1.4) are nonlinear. A PDE can be written as

1.1 Introduction 3
L[u] = f, 
(1.1.5)
where f is a known function.
When f = 0, the PDE (1.1.5) is called homogeneous, otherwise it is called non- 
homogeneous. The following proposition is the same as for an ordinary differential 
equation.
Superposition Property 1.1.1. (a) Suppose {uk}km=1 are solutions of a linear equa­
tion
L[u] = 0,
then any linear combination
m 
u = 
ckuk
k=1
is also a solution of the linear equation L [ u ] = 0, where ck,k = 1,2, • •• ,m, are 
constants.
(b) Suppose {uk}km=1 is a basis of solutions for the homogeneous equation
L[u] = 0,
and up is a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation
L[u] = f,
then
m
u = 
ckuk + up
k=1
is the general solution of the equation L[u]=f.
Under suitable conditions, the superposition principle holds when m = rc> in some 
sense. We will discuss this case in more detail in Chapter 2.
Throughout this book, we mainly focus on linear equations and systems. Some 
nonlinear PDEs are also included to illustrate the complicated dynamics of the sys­
tem in comparison with the linear problem. When a PDE problem is nonlinear, the 
structure of the solution is much more complicated. The solution for a nonlinear PDE 
may produce new unexpected patterns or chaotic phenomena such as shock waves 
or blowup in finite time. Analysis for a nonlinear PDE often needs more advanced 
mathematical tools and theories, which is one of the main research topics in modern 
mathematical sciences.

4 CHAPTER 1 Basics of partial differential equations
1.2 Fundamental PDE questions: Well-posedness and 
ill-posedness
For a physical problem, in addition to a governing PDE or system, initial conditions, 
boundary conditions or initial and boundary conditions may need to be imposed along 
with the equation or system. Otherwise, one may find an infinite number of solutions. 
Therefore a complete PDE model for a physical problem may need to impose ap­
propriate initial, boundary, or initial-boundary conditions. These conditions are often 
derived from a physical reality, such as Newton’s cooling law in heat conduction. We 
will discuss a number of models arising from physical sciences and engineering on 
how an initial or initial-boundary conditions are imposed in later chapters.
As we will see many examples in Section 1.3, a partial differential equation often 
models certain physical phenomenon. The solution provides the essential information 
to understand the complicated dynamics, to explain experimental observations, and 
to explore new insights of physical phenomena. However, one needs to ask whether 
or not the model is appropriate or can be justified. How much tolerance (sensitivity) 
does a PDE model allow? These are fundamental questions before answering other 
questions. This leads to the so-called well-posedness or ill-posedness question for a 
PDE problem.
1.2.1 What is a well-posed or ill-posed PDE problem?
The first question one would ask is whether or not a PDE problem has a solution 
(Existence Question or Solvability). If a PDE model does not have a solution, then 
the model must be wrong or nonphysical. From the mathematical point of view, the 
solvability of a differential equation is interesting and has its own intrinsic value. 
One of Hilbert’s questions raised in the world congress of Mathematicians in the 
19th century is concerned with this problem. The Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem 
([7]) and Levy’s counterexample (see [22]) were motivated by Hilbert’s question. 
There is a large branch of mathematical analysis devoted to the question (see [13] for 
example).
The second question is whether or not a PDE problem has one or many solu­
tions (Uniqueness Question). When a PDE problem has more than one solution, then 
numerical computation often becomes unstable. A bifurcation may occur for the so­
lution of an evolution system as time evolves.
The third question is whether or not the solution to a PDE problem has a small 
change when known data have small changes. This question is called the Continuous 
Dependence. This is important due to the fact that most data obtained from practical 
measurements or experiments have some errors. If the solution of a PDE problem has 
a drastic change when the known data have small changes, then one could not be sure 
if the model is suitable to describe the physical phenomenon. We will see that there 
are many PDE models that are not well-posed.
We summarize the above discussion to present the following definition.

1.2 Fundamental PDE questions: Well-posedness and ill-posedness 5
Definition 1.2.1. A PDE problem is said to be well-posed, if the problem has a 
unique solution and the solution is continuously dependent upon the known data. 
Otherwise, the problem is said to be not well-posed or ill-posed.
One of the challenging questions is how to use the theory of PDEs to model a 
physical problem properly (modeling process). When a PDE model is established, it 
may be well-posed or ill-posed. This is one of the major research topics in applied 
mathematics. In this book we will discuss numerous examples to illustrate how a 
PDE model is built up and how these well-posedness questions are answered.
In addition to the question of well-posedness for a PDE problem, there are many 
other important questions one may want to answer. Here is a list of some sample 
questions:
(Q1) What is the behavior of the solution for a time-dependent problem as time 
evolves?
(Q2) What qualitative properties does the solution have?
(Q3) What is the numerical solution (numerical algorithms)?
(Q4) How can one find numerical solutions efficiently (convergence and conver­
gence rate)?
(Q5) How can one use the solution to explain the physical phenomenon (data inter­
pretation)?
One can ask many more questions such as free-boundary problems and inverse 
problems that are important in applications (see [4]). In the following subsection we 
give afew examples to show why the well-posedness for a PDE problem is important.
1.2.2 Some examples about the well-posedness question
In this subsection we give a few examples to illustrate the importance of well- 
posedness for a PDE problem.
Example 1.2 .1. Consider the following PDE problem (a boundary value problem): 
Find u(x, y) such that
Uxx + Uyy = 1, 
(x,y) e B1 (0) := {(x,y) e R2 : x2 + y2 < 1}, 
(1.2.1)
Vvu(x,y) = 0, 
(x,y) e dB 1 (0) = {(x,y) e R2 : x2 + y2 = 1}, 
(1.2.2)
where v represents the outward unit normal on dB 1 (0) and Vvu := Vu • v represents 
the normal derivative of u on dB 1 (0).
We claim that the PDE problem has no solution u(x, y) satisfying Eq. (1.2.1)-(1.2.2).
Indeed, if a solution u(x, y) exists, integrating Eq. (1.2.1) over B1(0), we see
n
[ uxx + Uyy ] dxdy = dxdy = n.

[Uxx + Uyy]dxdy 
I 
(VvU)ds = 0,
i.e., a contradiction.
If we change the constant 1 in the right-hand side of Eq. (1.2.1) to 0, then there 
exists an infinite number of solutions for (1.2.1)-(1.2.2). In fact, any constant is a so­
lution to (1.2.1)-(1.2.2). A more challenging question is whether or not there are other 
nonconstant solutions to Eq. (1.2.1)-(1.2.2). The short answer is negative, which will 
be investigated in Chapter 6. We will prove a general result that gives a completed 
answer for the Laplace equation.
Example 1.2 .2. Consider the following initial-value problem: Find u(x, y) such that
uxx + uyy = 0, 
~o< <x< <x ,y> 0, 
(1.2.3)
u(x, 0) = 0 ,Uy(x, 0) = 0, 
—c< <x< rc>. 
(1.2.4)
It can be shown (see Chapter 7) that u(x, y) = 0, (x, y) e R x R+ is the unique 
solution. However, if we make a small perturbation for the initial data, say,
sin(nx) 
y , 
n '
which converges to 0 uniformly on R1 as n ^ <x>, then a unique solution of 
Eq. (1.2.3)-(1.2.4) can be found as follows:
u(x, y) = sin(nx)(eny — e ny) 
2 n n2
which is unbounded in R1 x R+. This implies that the PDE problem (1.2.3)-(1.2.4) 
does not continuously depend on the initial data.
Example 1.2 .3. Consider the following initial-value problem: Find u(x , t) such that
ut - uxx = 0, 
—^ < x < ^,t > 0,
(1.2.5)
u(x, 0) = 0, 
—^ <x< rc>.
(1.2.6)
It is clear that u(x, t) = 0 is a solution. It is natural to ask if the problem has a 
nontrivial solution.
Define
0(t) =
e t2 , if t = 0,
0, 
if t = 0.

1.2 Fundamental PDE questions: Well-posedness and ill-posedness

Then, $(t) e C™ (R1). Define
VTO dn 6(t) x2n 
if x e R1 t> 0
u(x,t) = J n=0=0 dtn(P(()(2n)!, 
11 x e R , t> 0
0, 
ift=0.
It is easy to verify that
ut - uxx = 0, 
xe R , t > 0.
It follows that the solution for Eq. (1.2.5)-(1.2.6) 1s not unique.
Next, we give a few examples to show some physical phenomena that are very 
d1fferent from a l1near PDE.
Example 1.2 .4. Cons1der the follow1ng boundary value problem:
uxx +uyy =u(1 - u), 
(x, y) e B1 (0) ={(x,y) e R2 :x2+y2 < 1},
Vvu(x, y) = 0, 
(x, y) e dB 1 (0) = {(x, y) e R2 : x2 + y2 = 1}.
It1s clear that u1(x, y) = 0 and u2(x, y) = 1 are two solut1ons. Does the problem have 
a nonconstant solut1on? The answer w1ll be g1ven 1n Chapter 6 (see Example 6.5.1).
Here 1s another 1nterest1ng example.
Example 1.2 .5. Cons1der the nonl1near problem:
— Au = up(or8eu), 
x e &.,
u(x) = 0, 
x e dQ,
where p> 1 and is a domain in Rn.
Clearly, u(x) = 0 1s a solut1on to the above nonl1near problem. Does the problem 
have a nontrivial solution? To answer this question, one needs much deeper analysis. 
It turns out that the question depends on p, the dimension n, and the geometry of .
If is bounded and
1 < p < rc>, for n = 1, 2; 1 < p < n + 2
n — 2, for n > 3,
then the nonlinear problem has a nontrivial solution. On the other hand, when
n+2 
p >-----z, 
n > 3
n—2
and is a star-shaped domain, then the nonlinear problem has only the trivial solution 
(see [8]).
For p = n—2, the existence of a nontrivial solution depends on the geometry of 
(called the Yamabe problem in differential geometry, see [33]).
If one replaces the nonlinear term up by 8eu with some 8 > 0, then there are more 
interesting cases for the existence of multiple solutions. It depends on the dimension 
and size of the parameter 8 ([3]).

8 CHAPTER 1 Basics of partial differential equations
Example 1.2 .6. (Finite-time blowup) Consider the following nonlinear heat equa­
tion: Let p>0. Find u(x, t) such that
ut - Au = up, 
x e Rn,t> 0, 
(1.2.7)
u(x, 0) = f(x) > 0 
x e Rn. 
(1.2.8)
It will be shown (see Chapter 8) that if 1 < p < 1 + 2 there exists a constant T* > 0 
such that u(x, t) becomes unbounded as t ^ T*- for any f (x) > 0 with
f (x)dx >0.
Rn
On the other hand, if p > 1 + 2, the unique solution u(x, t) exists globally if f (x) is 
sufficiently small and blows up in finite time if f(x) is suitably large.
Example 1.2 .7. Consider the following nonlinear wave equation: Let p be a positive 
integer. Find u(x, t) such that
utt - Au = -up, x e Rn,t> 0, 
(1.2.9)
u(x,0)=f(x),ut(x,0)=g(x) x eRn. 
(1.2.10)
It will be seen in Chapter 8 that the global existence or finite-time blowup to the 
problem (1.2.9)-(1.2.10) depends on the dimension n and p (see [30]).
Example 1.2 .8. (Shock-wave phenomenon) Consider the following initial-value 
problem: Find u(x, t) such that
ut + uux = 0, 
—rc> <x< rc> ,t > 0, 
(1.2.11)
u(x, 0) = f(x), 
—^ <x< rc>, 
(1.2.12)
where
.. . f 1, ifx< 0 
f(x) = 0, ifx>0.
It will be shown in Chapter 9 that u(x, t) = 1 is a solution for any x<0 near t = 0, 
while u(x , t) = 0 for any x>0 with sufficiently small t . However, near (0, 0) there 
is no solution in the classical sense. Nevertheless, there is a solution in the weak 
sense (in Sobolev space). The most interesting observation is that the solution forms a 
shock wave along the line x = 2. We will discuss this class of equations in Chapter 9. 
Example 1.2.8 shows why a nonlinear problem is much harder to analyze for its 
solution and why one needs to extend the definition of a solution in the weak sense.
For a general partial differential equation, it is hard to answer the well-posedness 
question. This is even more difficult when a PDE problem is nonlinear. However, 
there is a very interesting result such as the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem when the 
coefficients of a PDE are analytic. The interested reader may find this theorem in an 
advanced PDE book such as [13].

1.3 Some important equations and systems 9
1.3 Some important equations and systems
In this section we introduce some important equations and systems in applied sci­
ences. These equations and systems are derived from various physical models in 
natural and physical sciences as well as modern economics, finance, and social sci­
ences. In subsequent chapters, we will study some examples in detail on how to use 
basic physical and experimental laws to derive various equations and systems and to 
find explicit solutions for these model problems.
1.3.1 Some model equations in the physical sciences
Example 1.3 .1. The heat equation and chemical reaction-diffusion equations.
This example models the heat conduction in a medium occupying a region c 
Rn. Let u(x, t) represent the temperature at position x e and time t > 0. Then, 
u(x , t ) satisfies the following heat equation:
ut — k2Au = 0, 
x e &,t > 0,
(1.3.1)
where
n d 2
A:=s
called the Laplace operator, 
where k>0 is the thermal conductivity. A detailed derivation of the physical model 
will be given in Chapter 4.
Eq. (1.3.1) and its generalization are also used for a very different class of phys­
ical models arising from chemical reaction-diffusion processes. Suppose there are 
m types of chemical substances with concentration ui(x, t) of the ith chemical sub­
stance and fi(x,t,u 1, ■■■ ,um) represents the output of chemical reaction for the i th 
component with other chemical substances. Then, ui satisfies
uit — a2kui = fi(x,t,ui, ■ ■■ ,um),
i = 1, ■ ■■ ,m, 
(1.3.2)
where ai > 0, i = 1, ■■■ ,m represents the diffusion coefficient.
There are many other types of physical problems that can be modeled by this type 
of equation and system. This type of PDE is called parabolic. The precise definition 
will be given in Section 1.4.
Example 1.3 .2. Equation of wave propagation.
Let u(x, t) represent the strength of a sound (pressure) at position x = (x1, x2, x3) e 
c R3 and time t. When the sound propagates in a region, u(x, t) satisfies the fol­
lowing equation:
utt — c2Au = 0, 
x e &,t> 0, 
(1.3.3)
where c represents the propagation speed of the sound.

10 CHAPTER 1 Basics of partial differential equations
A similar equation that describes the motion of a soliton in one-space dimension 
can be expressed in the following form
^tt - c2 '^xx + sin ^ = 0 •
This is called the sine-Gordon equation in physics.
This class of PDEs is called hyperbolic.
Example 1.3 .3. The Laplace equation and Cauchy-Riemann equation.
For a static electric field, the electric field can be expressed by a gradient of po­
tential function u(x):
E = —V u
Gauss’s law yields
divE =—V« (Vu) = — Au = p(x), 
(1.3.4)
where p represents the charge density.
Eq. (1.3.4) is called a Poisson equation. When p(x) = 0, it is called the Laplace 
equation and a solution of the Laplace equation is called a harmonic function.
Another motivation for the Laplace equation (1.3.4) comes from the minimiza­
tion of kinetic energy. Let v(x) represent a physical quantity such as momentum or 
pressure in a region c Rn. The kinetic energy can be expressed by
E(v) := 11 |Vv|2dx^
A fundamental problem in physics is to find a function that minimizes the energy 
functional E(v).
It will be seen in Chapter 6 that the minimum of the energy functional E(v) is the 
solution of the Laplace equation:
Au = 0 • 
(1.3.5)
In complex analysis, a fundamental problem is to determine whether or not a com­
plex function f(z) is analytic in a domain. It turns out that this problem is equivalent 
to the following Cauchy-Riemann equation:
f) = 0,
where z = x — iy is the complex conjugate of a complex variable z = x + iy.
If we separate f (z) into the real and imaginary parts:
f(z)= Ref(z) + i(I mf (z)) := u(x, y) + iv(x, y),

1.3 Some important equations and systems
11
then,
fz) = dr - id)(u(x,y) + iv(x,y)) = 0, 
dz dx dy
which is equivalent to the Laplace equation:
ku = Uxx + Uyy = 0; 
Av = Vxx + Vyy = 0.
This implies that a complex functionf(z) is analytic if and only if both real Ref(z) 
and imaginary Imf(z) are harmonic functions in the domain.
Example 1.3.4. Minimum surface equation.
In differential geometry, an interesting problem is to find a minimum surface in a 
closed rope. It is also the classical model for a soap bubble in mechanics.
Let u(x) be the displacement of a surface at point x = (x 1 ,x 2, ■■■ ,xn) e c Rn. 
Then, u(x) satisfies
V u
V( . 
) = 0, 
x e Q. 
(1.3.6)
1+ + |V u |2
Eq. (1.3.6) is nonlinear and the coefficient approaches 0 if |Vu | approaches rc>. 
On the other hand, if |Vu| is small, then Eq. (1.3.6) can be approximated by the 
Laplace equation (1.3.5).
In a more general setting, this type of PDE is called elliptic. We will give a precise 
classification of a PDE in two variables with constant coefficients in Section 1.4. In 
this book, we mainly study these three types of partial differential equations.
1.3.2 Some PDEs arising from various engineering fields
Example 1.3 .5. The fundamental equation in quantum mechanics (Schrodinger’s 
equation).
In quantum mechanics, the motion of a particle is described by a wave function 
u(x , t) that satisfies the following fundamental equation:
h2
ihut +----- Au + v(x, t)u = 0,
2m
where i represents the complex unit, h and m are the Planck constant and mass of the 
particles, respectively, while v(x, t) is the potential function in a field.
It is very difficult to analyze the motion of a single particle. In reality, one often 
studies the motion for a large number of particles in a macroscopic way. This leads 
to a general transport equation that will be investigated in Chapter 9.
Example 1.3 .6. The fundamental equations in electromagnetic fields (Maxwell’s 
equations).
In electromagnetic fields, the interactions of electric and magnetic fields are gov­
erned by Maxwell’s equations. Let E(x, t) and H(x , t) be the electric and magnetic 

12
CHAPTER 1 Basics of partial differential equations
fields at position x e £2 c R3 and time t, where the bold letter represents a vector in 
R3 . Then, E(x , t ) and H(x , t ) satisfy the following system:
s E t — Vx H = J (x,t), 
x e &,t> 0, 
(1.3.7)
^ H t + Vx E = 0, x e Q,t> 0, 
(1.3.8)
where J(x, t) represents the known internal current, the physical parameters e and ^ 
are the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability.
Maxwell’s equations play an essential role in electric engineering. Modern 
telecommunication equipment and many advanced device designs are based on the 
solution of Maxwell’s equations.
Example 1.3 .7. Fundamental equations in fluid mechanics (Euler’s equations and 
Navier-Stokes equation).
In fluid mechanics, a challenging problem is to understand the motion of the fluid 
in a medium. Fluids are usually divided into compressible and incompressible. Let 
v(x, t) represent the velocity field for a fluid. Let p be the density of a fluid. The 
principle of mass conservation implies that
pt + V(pv) = 0.
The principle of conservation of momentum yields
P[vt + (v • V)v] = —Vp + F(x, t), 
x e Q,t > 0,
where p represents the pressure and F is the external force, such as gravity.
For a compressible fluid such as natural gas, the pressure p is a function of p :
p = p(p).
The equations for (p , v) are called Euler’s equations.
For an incompressible fluid such as water, the density p is a constant. Moreover, 
there is a viscous force that can be expressed by Av. Then, v and p(x, t) satisfy
v t — ah v + (v •V) v +V p = F (x,t), 
x e &,t > 0, 
(1.3.9)
V-v = 0, x e Q,t> 0, 
(1.3.10)
where F(x , t) represents the external force acting on the fluid. The constant a>0is 
the viscosity coefficient.
Both Euler’s and Navier-Stokes equations are nonlinear. The global existence of 
a solution for the Navier-Stokes equation is still an open problem up to now. It is one 
of the millennium problems proposed by the Clay Mathematical Research Institute 
with a one million dollar prize if the problem is solved.
There are many other important equations in modern industries. An interesting 
example is the semiconductor equations that describe the ion transportation in elec­
tronic devices. We omit these equations here. The interested reader may find books 
dealing with these topics for device modeling and simulations.

1.3 Some important equations and systems 13
1.3.3 Some model equations in biological and life sciences
In biological, ecological, health, and life sciences, there are many problems that can 
be modeled by partial differential equations. We give two examples here (also see 
[35] for an infectious disease model).
Example 1.3 .8. Population growth model.
Suppose u(x , t) is the population density. Due to the movement of the general 
population, a diffusion process occurs in which the flux is proportional to the gradient 
of the density (similar to Fourier’s law). Then, the empirical data show that u(x , t) 
satisfies the logarithmic growth model:
ut — a2Au = r(x, t)u( 1----- ) — d(x, t)u,
(1.3.11)
where r(x,t) >0 and d(x, t) represent the combined growth and death rates, respec­
tively. The constants a and K represent the diffusion coefficient and the maximum 
capacity of the population in the region.
Example 1.3 .9. The predator-prey model.
In an ecological system, the balance between predator and prey is very important 
in order to avoid extinction of a species. Suppose u(x, t) and v(x, t) are the popula­
tion densities of predator and prey, respectively. Then, u and v satisfy the modified 
population growth model, with an additional term due to an abundant prey popula­
tion:
ut — aAu = r 1 u( 1------ ) + fluv — d 1 u, 
(1.3.12)
K1
vt — bAv = r 2 v( 1------ ) — fluv — d2 v, 
(1.3.13)
K2
where fl>0 measures the additional growth due to the prey population.
There is an interesting dynamic when various parameters vary as time evolves.
1.3.4 Some PDEs arising in economics and finance
In modern economics, the PDE is used to price many types of financial assets, such 
as bonds and stock options. The model equation is typically given by a stochastic 
differential equation. By using the capital-asset pricing principle, it turns out that the 
equation is equivalent to a parabolic type of equation. Here we give two examples.
Example 1.3. 10. Interest-rate model and bond-pricing model.
The interest rate is the most important factor in the world economy. There are 
many different mathematical models for an interest rate r(t) in economics and fi­
nance. The uncertainty is that the interest rate is unknown in the future. Most interest­
rate models are given by a stochastic form:
dr(t) = r 0 dt + adW (t), 
(1.3.14)

14 CHAPTER 1 Basics of partial differential equations
where r0 is a long-term interest rate given by the Federal Reserve Open Board Com­
mittee in the United States, a > 0 is called the volatility and W(t) is the standard 
Wiener process (Brownian motion).
Once r(t) is determined, we can model a bond price. Let B(s, t) represent the 
bond price for a Company’s security s at time t. Under certain assumptions, B(s, t) 
satisfies the following equation:
Bt + ^22s2Bss + rsBs - rB = f(s, t), 
(1.3.15)
where a is the volatility of the bond price movement and f(s, t) represents the cash 
flow produced by the company.
Throughout the history of the financial world, a financial crisis in a country is 
often induced by a sudden change of the interest rate r(t). The reason is that a sud­
den change of r(t) may drastically affect the price of a bond, which will affect the 
currency and security prices sharply, causing a financial crisis in a country.
Example 1.3. 11. The fundamental equation of the option pricing model (Black- 
Scholes equation).
In finance engineering, a fundamental assumption is that a stock price follows the 
geometric Brownian motion. If S(t) represents the stock price at time t, then S(t) 
satisfies
dS(t) 
~S(tT = ^dt + adW (t),
(1.3.16)
where ^ represents the expected return rate and a is the stock volatility.
Let u(s, t) represent the option price for a stock s at time t. Then, u(s, t) satisfies
ut + — a 2 s 2 uss + rsus — ru = 0,
s > 0 ,t > 0,
(1.3.17)
where r represents the interest rate, a is the volatility of the stock s. When a changes 
dramatically, the option price will suffer a huge swing. The mathematical explanation 
is that a solution of Eq. (1.3.17) is very sensitive to the change ofa.
It can be shown by using suitable transforms that both models in Examples 1.3.10 
and 1.3.11 are similar to the heat equation (1.3.1). However, unlike heat conduction, 
the models in economy and finance may not be valid in a certain time period when 
there is a disruptive event occurring (called the Black-Swan phenomenon). There are 
too many factors that can cause a drastic change that in turn the mathematical model 
for a bond or a stock price fails. However, the empirical financial data show that the 
model does hold over a long-term time period.

1.4 Classification of second-order partial differential equations 15
1.4 Classification of second-order partial differential 
equations
In this section we classify a general class of second-order partial differential equa­
tion with constant coefficients. These second-order PDEs can be broadly divided into 
three classes of canonical equations. There are some features and special mathemat­
ical tools for each type of equation. Moreover, each type of equation represents a 
large class of physical models. By introducing suitable new variables, we will see 
that second-order PDEs can be classified as one of the following canonical forms: the 
heat equation, wave equation or Laplace equation.
1.4.1 Classification of a second-order PDE with constant 
coefficients
To illustrate the basic idea, we begin with a second-order linear PDE with two vari­
ables.
Let u(x, y) satisfy the following general second-order linear partial differential 
equation:
L[u]:= auxx + 2buxy + cuyy + d1ux + d2uy + d3u = f (x, y), 
(1.4.1)
where all coefficients in Eq. (1.4.1) are constants and f(x, y) is a general function of 
(x, y).
Define a quadratic form
F(l, n) = al2 + 2bnl + cn2.
The corresponding matrix, denoted by A, of the quadratic form is equal to
a=(a b )■
For the matrix A, the characteristic equation is equal to
p(k) := |A - XI| = k2 - (a + c)k - (b2 - ac) = 0.
Since
D := (a + c)2 + 4(b2 - ac) = (a - c)2 + 4b2 > 0,
there exist two real eigenvalues, k1 and k2. Moreover,
k1 + k2 = a + c, 
k1k2 = ac - b ■
Case 1: ac - b2 > 0.
Then, there exist two eigenvalues (may be repeated) with the same sign. We as­
sume both eigenvalues are positive. In this case, for each of the real roots k1 and k2, 

16 CHAPTER 1 Basics of partial differential equations
we can find the corresponding eigenvectors, denoted by v1 and v2, respectively. Since 
A is symmetric, then the two eigenvectors v1 and v2 can be chosen to be orthonormal.
Let
v1 = (v11,v12)T, v2 = (v21,v22)T,
where the exponent T means the transpose of a vector.
Now, we introduce new variables
x = v 11f + v 12 n, 
y = v 21f + v 22 n.
Define
v(f, n) := u(x, y) = u(v 11 f + v 12n, v21f + v22n).
By the chain rule, we see v(f, n) satisfies
X 1 vff + X2 vnn + lower-order terms = f.
We further introduce a new variable
A simple calculation implies that w(f, n) := v(f, n) satisfies the following equation:
wff + wnn + lower-order terms = f (f, n). 
(1.4.2)
Eq. (1.4.2) is an elliptic type of equation.
Case 2: ac - b2 < 0.
In this case, the characteristic equation has two distinct eigenvalues with opposite 
sign, say, X1 > 0 and X2 < 0. By a similar approach, we can transform Eq. (1.4.1) 
into
wf: f: - wn:n: + lower-order terms = f. 
(1.4.3)
Eq. (1.4.3) is the typical form of a wave equation ifwe use the familiar variables 
t = f: and x =n:.
Case 3: ac - b2 = 0.
In this case, at least one of the coefficients a and c is not equal to 0. We assume 
a>0.
We can follow the same technique to transform Eq. (1.4.1) into the following 
equation:
wff + (d1 wf + d2Wn + d3 w) = f *(f, n).
(1.4.4)

1.4 Classification of second-order partial differential equations
17
The coefficient d2 must be a nonzero constant. Otherwise, Eq. (1.4.4) contains only 
a partial derivative with respect to f, which is an ordinary differential equation.
Since d* = 0, we can further introduce a new variable (say, n — - d*) to reduce 
the above equation to the following form:
Wn — Wff — (d* Wf + d2w) = — f(f, rj)). 
(1.4.5)
This is the classical heat equation if we consider n as the time variable t.
When the coefficients in Eq. (1.4.1) are continuous functions of x and y, we con­
sider Eq. (1.4.1) in a neighborhood Br (P0) ofa point P (x0, y0):
(a) if a(x, y)c(x, y) — b2(x, y) > 0 in Br(P0), Eq. (1.4.1) is called an elliptic 
equation;
(b) if a(x, y)c(x, y) — b2(x, y) < 0 in Br(P0), Eq. (1.4.1) is called a hyperbolic 
equation;
(c) If a(x, y)c(x, y) — b2(x, y) = 0 in Br(P0), Eq. (1.4.1) is called a parabolic 
equation.
If in a region e R2, Eq. (1.4.1) is elliptic in one subregion while hyperbolic or 
parabolic in another subregion, then we say Eq. (1.4.1) is of mixed type in . An 
interesting example is the Tricomi equation:
uxx + xuyy = 0, 
(x, y) e = {(x, y): —^ < x < <x,y > 0},
which is elliptic if x >0 and hyperbolic if x<0.
1.4.2 Classification of general second-order linear PDEs
Now, we extend the idea in the above subsection to classify a general second- 
order linear PDE in n dimensions. For convenience, a point in Rn is denoted by 
x = (x 1, ••• ,Xn).
nn
L[u]:= 
aij (x)uxixj + 
bi (x)uxi + c(x)u = f (x),
i,j=1 
i=1
where aij (x), bi (x), and c(x) are known coefficients. 
We may assume
aij(x) = aji(x), 
i,j = 1, ■■■ ,n.
Otherwise, we may define
* _ aij + aji
Cl: — — ----------
ij 
2
then,
nn
i,j=1
2
aij uxi xj = i,j=1 aij uxi xj

18 CHAPTER 1 Basics of partial differential equations
hence, the operator L is the same as before. 
Introduce a quadratic form
i,j=1
aij^i^j.
Q&
n
The corresponding matrix of the quadratic form is
A — (aij)n xn.
Since A is symmetric, the corresponding characteristic equation
p(k):—|A - M|— 0
has n real eigenvalues and n linearly independent orthonormal eigenvectors v1, ■ ■■, vn. 
Let V be the matrix with the i th-column vector Vi ,i — 1,2, ■ ■■ ,n. From the theory 
of linear algebra, we can have the following cases:
Case 1: All eigenvalues are positive (or all negative).
From linear algebra, one can introduce new variables
n — VI,
to transform the quadratic form Q(£) into the following canonical form:
Q(£) — n 2 + n 2 +------+ n 2n-
Under the new variables, the corresponding PDE becomes
Unini +------+ unnnn + lower-order terms — f,
which is a typical elliptic equation.
Case 2: There exists one eigenvalue that has the opposite sign to the rest of the 
eigenvalues.
We assume there exists one eigenvalue that has the opposite sign to the rest of 
the eigenvalues. For this case, we use the same technique to obtain the following 
canonical form
Q(^) — n 2 - (n 2 +------+ n n).
Under the new variables with t — n 1, yk — nk, k — 2, • • • ,n, the corresponding PDE 
becomes
utt - (uy2y2 +------+ uynyn) + lower order terms — f,
which is a typical hyperbolic equation.
When there exists more than one eigenvalue with a different sign to the rest, we 
still call this type of equation a hyperbolic type.

1.4 Classification of second-order partial differential equations
19
Case 3: There exists at least one eigenvalue that is equal to 0.
In this case, just like the case with two variables we again can introduce new 
variables such that the PDE becomes
Ut - (Uy2y2 +------ + Uynyn) + lower order terms = f,
which is a typical parabolic equation.
Case 4: There exist more eigenvalues that are not included in the previous cases.
In this case, the PDE problem becomes much more difficult to deal with the basic 
well-posedness questions. These are the research topics in differential operator theory 
(see [13]).
1.4.3 A general nonlinear second-order PDE
The classification for the second-order linear PDE can be easily extended to a general 
nonlinear second-order PDE in n-space dimension.
Let U(x) be an unknown function in Rn . Introduce
DiU = dx~-,
du
DijU =
d 2 U 
dxiXj ’
i,j = 1, ■ ■■ ,n.
Let F(p, q, s, x) be a differentiable function for (p,q,s,x) e Rnn x Rn x R1 x Rn. 
The most general form of the second-order partial differential equation in Rn can be 
written as follows:
F (Dij U, DiU, U,x) = 0.
(1.4.6)
Eq. (1.4.6) is called a fully nonlinear equation. If F(p, q, s, x) is linear with respect 
to pij for all 1 < i, j < n, Eq. (1.4.6) is called quasilinear. If F(p,q, s, x) is linear 
with respect to pij,qi, then Eq. (1.4.6) is called semilinear.
Define an n x n matrix:
A=
dPij
dF(p,q,s,x)
V 
dPij 
nx x n
Eq. (1.4.6) is called the elliptic type if all eigenvalues of the matrix A are positive- 
(negative-) definite. If there exists one eigenvalue that is positive and the rest are 
negative, then Eq. (1.4.6) is called hyperbolic. If there exists one eigenvalue that is 
equal to 0 and the rest are all positive (negative), then Eq. (1.4.6) is called parabolic. 
All the rest of the cases are called mixed type or degenerate type.
There is no general method to deal with a fully nonlinear equation (1.4.6). How­
ever, there are many research papers in the literature dealing with each type of 
nonlinear PDEs. The study for this equation needs much deeper mathematical tools 
and techniques. The discussion about this equation is beyond the scope of this text­
book.

1.5 Some elementary formulas and inequalities
In this section we give some identities and inequlities. Their proofs can be found in 
calculus and analysis.
1.5.1 Young’s inequality
Let a,b > 0. Then, for any e > 0
(1.5.2)
b - sap 
e-pbq
- p 
q ,
(1.5.1)
where p, q > 1 and
1+1=1

A special case for p = q = 2 is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
< ea2 
b2
a - ~+2e ■
The proof can be found in a calculus book.
1.5.2 Gauss’s divergence theorem and Green’s identity
Gauss’s divergence theorem. Let be a domain in Rn with C1 -boundary dQ and 
F(x) be a vector field. Then,
I V- Fdx = f [F • v]ds, 
(1.5.3)
where v is the outward unit normal on d&.
An immediate consequence is the following integral by parts in n dimensions: Let 
u(x), v(x) be differentiable in ,
u(x)v(x)xi dx =- 
u(x)xi v(x)dx + 
[u(x)v(x)vi]ds,
where v, is the ith component of the normal vector v on dQ.
By using the above integration by parts, we have the following property.
Proposition 1.5.1. (Green’s identity)
Let u(x) and v(x) be differentiable in Q. Then,
I [u(kv') - (Au)v] dx = f [u(Vvv) - (Vvu)v] ds^ (1.5.4)
The proof is left as an exercise.

1.5 Some elementary formulas and inequalities 21
1.5.3 Spherical coordinates in Rn and the singular integral
Let x = (x 1, ■■■ ,xn) e Rn. Introduce spherical coordinates (p, 0 1, ■■■ ,0n-1 ,ty) in 
Rn:
x 1 = p cos 0 1 •• • cos 0n-1 sin ty,
x 2 = p cos 0 1 • • • sin 0n-1 sin ty,
• ♦ • ,
xn = p cos ty,
where 0 < p < rc>, 0 < 0 < 2n, 0 < ty < n.
A sphere centered at the origin with radius r, denoted by Br (0) ={x e Rn :|x| < 
r}, can be expressed in spherical coordinates by
p = r, 0 < 0i < 2 n, 0 < ty < n,i = 1, 2, • • • ,n - 1.
The volume of the sphere Br (0) is equal to
V = M(n)rn,
where m(n) represents the surface area of the unit ball in Rn.
Another interesting example is the following proposition about a singular integral.
Proposition 1.5.2. Let Br (0) be a ball centered at the origin with radius r>0. Then,
f 
7^dx < C(n,P)rn-p,
Br (0) |x |p
where C(n, p) depends only on p and n.
1.5.4 Gronwall’s inequality
Proposition 1.5.3. Let a(t) and {3(f) be integrable on [0, ^). Let y(t) > 0 satisfy
y'(t) < a(t)y(t) + 3(t), 
y(0) = y0. 
(1.5.5)
Then,
y(t) < exp{j a(T)dT} y0 + j exp{-J a(^)d^}fl(T)dr ,t>0.
Proof. Introduce an integrating factor
exp {- a(T)dT}.
0
We can rewrite the inequality (1.5.5) as follows:
< 3(t)exp{-y a(T)dT}.
ddly(,)exp{-]0
t
a(T)dT}
0

22 CHAPTER 1 Basics of partial differential equations
The desired inequality follows immediately by integrating the above inequality over 
[0 ,t ]. 
□
In applications, there is a different version of Gronwall’s inequality.
Proposition 1.5.4. Let m 1 (t) and m2(t) be nonnegative and integrable on [0, to). 
Let y(t) > 0 satisfy
y(t) < y m 1 (t — s)y(s)ds + m2(t), 
t > 0. 
(1.5.6)
Then, for any T>0,
y(t) < C(T), t G (0 ,T ],
where C depends on the L1 (0,T)-norm of m1(t) and m2(t).
Proof. Instead of dealing with the inequality (1.5.6) we first consider the following 
integral equality:
y(t) = y m 1 (t — s)y(s)ds + m2(t), 
t > 0. 
(1.5.7)
Set y0 (t) = 0. Define a successive sequence {yn(t)} as follows:
yn+1(t) = 
m1(t — s)yn(s)ds + m2(t), 
t > 0,n> 0.
The Volterra integral equation (1.5.7) has a unique solution y(t) in a small interval 
[0,T0]:
y(t) = lim yn(t), 
0 < t < T0.
n ^to
Since m1(s, t) > 0, m2(s) > 0, it follows that
y(t) < C(T0).
We can start with t = T0 as an initial value and continue to obtain the estimate on 
[T0 , 2T0]. This step can done due to the fact that there exists a priori bound for y(t) 
in [0, T] (see Chapter 2, Example 2.5.2). For any T>0, by repeating this process a 
finite number of times, we obtain the desired estimate
0<y(t)<C(T), tG(0,T],
where C(T) depends on known data and an upper bound of T.
Since m1, m2 > 0, we see the desired estimate holds if the equality (1.5.7) is 
replaced by inequality (1.5.6). 
□
An interesting example frequently used in applications is that
1
m 1 (t - s) = (t - <a, 
a g (0, 1).

1.5 Some elementary formulas and inequalities 23
1.5.5 Poincare’s inequality
In this book we do not deal with weak derivatives and the theory of Sobolev spaces 
(see [1,23]). However, we may need some inequalities in the proofs of some results. 
The reader may consider a classical C 1 -function for these inequalities as a first step. 
For the readers’ convenience, a brief introduction about the theory of Sobolev spaces 
is given in Appendix B.
Poincare’s inequality I. Let be a bounded domain in Rn with Lipschitz boundary 
dQ. Suppose u(x) e H01 (Q) = W01,2(Q). Then, there exists a constant c0 such that
I u2dx < coj |Vu|2dx, 
Vu e H01 (^), 
(1.5.8)
where c0 depends only on and n.
A different version of Poincare’s inequality is the following one.
Poincare’s inequality II. Let be a bounded domain in Rn with Lipschitz boundary 
dQ. Suppose u(x) e H1 (Q). Then, there exists a constant c 1 such that
I (u - u0)2dx < c 1j |Vu|2dx, 
Vu e H1 (^), 
(1.5.9)
where c 1 depends only on Q,n and
u0 := 
[ u(x)dx.
| |
In dealing with some boundary conditions in the investigation of a PDE problem, 
we may need the following trace inequality.
Trace inequality. Let be a bounded domain in Rn with Lipschitz boundary dQ. 
Suppose u(x) e H1 (Q). Then, there exists a constant C such that
u2ds < £ j |Vu |2dx + C(£)j u2dx, 
Vu e H1 (^), 
(1.5.10)
where £ > 0 is arbitrary and C(£) depends only on £, and n.
Poincare’s inequalities and trace inequality can be extended to functions in 
Sobolev space IT01 ,p(Q) with p > 1 (see Appendix B). There is a rich theory about 
Sobolev spaces. The interested reader may consult with the monographs on Sobolev 
spaces such as [1,23].

ferent from one line to the next. Their precise dependency will be specified at the 
final step.
1.6 Notes and remarks
In this chapter we introduced some basic concepts in partial differential equations. 
Some important examples arising from the applied fields are presented in this chap­
ter as motivations for students with different background and research interests. They 
include the model equation in population dynamics, the fundamental equations in 
fluid mechanics, electromagnetic fields, and in economics and finance (the Black- 
Scholes equation). Some of those equations will be derived and investigated in detail 
in later chapters. We also present some very different phenomena for linear and non­
linear PDE problems. These examples illustrate why the analysis for PDEs plays an 
important role in applied sciences. Some nonlinear problems such as the Yamabe 
problem needs advanced mathematical theory and delicate analysis.
We emphasize that most PDE problems studied in this book are derived from 
concrete physical models. It is a challenging step to establish a suitable mathemat­
ical model for a practical problem by using PDEs. This step shows the importance 
that we need to study the well-posedness for a PDE problem. The theoretical study 
for a PDE problem is also an interesting art of sciences, which is a large branch of 
the research field in mathematical sciences. The classification of second-order PDEs

gives students the reason why we mainly focus on three types of basic equations in 
this book.

2.1 Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces
This section serves as a brief introduction as well as a review for basic spaces in 
functional analysis.
2.1.1 Normed vector spaces and Banach spaces
A linear space V is called a normed space if there is a mapping from V to R1, denoted 
by ||v|| for v e V, such that the following axioms hold:
(a) 
|| v || > 0. The equality holds if and only if v = 0.
(b) 
||cv|| = |c|||v||, for any c e R1.
(c) 
||v 1 + v2|| < ||v 1|| + ||v2|| for any v 1 ,v2 e V.
For a normed space V, we can define the convergence for a sequence vn in V.We 
say a sequence vn in V is convergent to v0 e V if
|| vn — v01| —— 0, 
as n —— 
.
All common limit properties from calculus hold for sequences in a normed space.
Similar to calculus, we say a sequence vn in a normed space V is a Cauchy se­
quence if for any e > 0, there exists an integer N > 0 such that
||vm — vn|| < e,
whenever m, n > N .
Definition 2.1.1. (a) A normed space V is called a Banach space if every Cauchy 
sequence in V converges to an element in V.
(b) A Banach space is called separable if there exists a sequence {vn}n=1 c V 
such that the set of all limit points of the set {vn,n = 1, 2, • • • .} is equal to V. Namely, 
{vn,n = 1, 2, •• •} is a dense subset of V.
Example 2.1 .1. In Rn, we define a norm for every x = (x 1 ,x2, • •• ,xn) by
||x ||2 x2 +------ + xn.

30 CHAPTER 2 Function spaces and the Fredholm Alternative
One can easily verify that ||x ||2 is a norm. Moreover, it is a separable Banach 
space since each real number can be obtained as a limit of a sequence of rational 
numbers.
Example 2.1 .2. Let n > 2,
Mn = {all n x n square matrices with entries in R 1}.
For any A = (aij)n xn g Mn, define
||A|| = max |aij |. 
1< i,j < n
It can be shown that Mn is a Banach space and is separable.
Example 2.1 .3. Let
lTO = {all sequences l = (a 1 ,a2, ■■■ ,an, ■■■) with ai g [0, 1]}.
For any sequence l g lTO, define
||l|| = max |ai |.
1< i< TO
It can be shown that lTO is a Banach space and is not separable (see Exercise 2.19).
2.1.2 Hilbert spaces
A special class of Banach spaces V is called Hilbert spaces if there exists an inner 
production defined in V .
Definition 2.1.2. Let V be a vector space. Suppose there is a bilinear mapping from 
V x V to R 1, denoted by < •, • > that satisfies the following axioms:
(a) 
< v, v >> 0. The equality holds if and only if v = 0.
(b) 
< c1u1 + c2u2, v >= c1 <u1,v > +c1 <u2,v >,
for any c1, c2 g R1, u1,u2,v g V.
(c) 
< u, v >=<v,u >.
Then, V is called an inner product space.
We can define a norm for V from an inner product in V by
||v|| = V< v, v >, v g V.
One can verify from Cauchy-Schwarz’s inequality (see below) along with the linear­
ity property that the above-defined mapping from V to R1 is indeed a norm, which is 
called an induced norm. A completed inner product space is called a Hilbert space.

2.2 Function spaces 31
Example2.1.4. In Rn, for any x = (x 1, ■ ■■ xn) and y = (y 1, ■ ■■ ,yn), define
n
<x,y>:= 
xkyk.
k=1
One can verify that the above-defined mapping is an inner product. We leave this as 
an exercise (Exercise 2.4). Hence, Rn is a Hilbert space.
Cauchy-Schwarz’s inequality. Let V be an inner product space. Then,
| <u,v> |<|| u |||| v ||, 
V u,v e V. 
(2.1.1)
Proof. Let u,v e V. Define a function
f(t)=<u+tv, u +tv >, t e R1.
The linear property yields that
f (t) = t2||v||2 + 2t < u,v > +||u||2.
Since f(t) > 0 for all t e R 1, it follows that
| <u,v> | < ||u|| • ||v||.
Moreover, the equality holds if and only if one vector is a multiple of another vector.
□
There are many interesting results about Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces. They 
are included in the basic materials of Functional Analysis (see [6]). For this book, we 
are interested in function spaces.
2.2 Function spaces
In this section we introduce some function spaces that will be used in this book.
2.2.1 Continuous and Holder continuous spaces: C(2) and C"(9)
Let be a domain in Rn with Lipschitz boundary. Let
C(£2) = {all continuous functions defined in £2}.
The norm for C(£2) for a bounded domain is defined by
||f ||0 = max |f(x)|.
x e £2

32
CHAPTER 2 Function spaces and the Fredholm Alternative
Let a be any fixed number in (0, 1],
Ca(J2) = { f(x) e C(£2):[f ]a< M,
where
[f]a
I f(x) - f(y)I 
sup -----------------
x,y e £2 ,x = y 
|x 
y |
The norm for Ca(£2) is defined by
II f II C«&) = II f II0 + [ f ] a.
A function in Ca(Q) is called Holder continuous with exponent a. When a = 1, it is 
called Lipschitz continuous.
2.2.2 The function spaces Ck’a(Si), C0(2), and C0s(2)
Let k > 1 be an integer. Define
Ck(Q) = {all functions f with Dkf e C(&)},
Cka(&) = {f(x) e Ck(£l): Dkf e Ca(£l)}, 
where Dk represents all possible kth-order partial derivatives of f. The norm of 
Ck'a (£2) is defined by
IIfIICk.«&) = £ IIDmfIIo + ]pIDmfI]a,
where m is a multiindex m = (mi, • • • ,mn), ImI = nT1 n=1 mi, mi is a nonnegative 
integer, and
m i 
mn .
dx1 1 • ••dxnn
... . . _ _ —. _ .... . _ __ _ . . .
When k = rc>, it is denoted by C“ (Q). C“ (Q) is a subspace of C“ (Q) where every 
function has a compact support. Namely, the set
supp(f) = {x e Q : f (x) e C“(O), f(x) = 0}
is bounded in Rn and dist{supp(f), dQ} > 0.
When is bounded, it can be shown in functional analysis that C(^), Ca(Q), 
Ck,a(i2) are Banach spaces. Moreover, the dimension for each of these spaces is 
infinite. The reader can find these results in functional analysis such as in [5].

2.2 Function spaces 33
2.2.3 Lp-space
A more interesting function space is called an Lp-space. A rigorous definition for 
this space requires the Lebesgue measure theory and Lebesgue integrals. However, 
we can think of these functions as approximations of continuous functions under an 
Lp -norm.
Let p > 1 and be a domain in Rn.
Definition 2.2.1. A function f(x) defined on is said to be p-integrable on if
| f(x) | pdx < to.
The set of all p-integrable functions is denoted by Lp(Q). The norm is defined by
||f||p =
One can show from the functional analysis that Lp (Q) is a Banach space under 
the above norm.
When p = to, the space is denoted by LTO (Q) equipped with the norm
|| f ||<x> = ess. sup | f(x)|.
x e Q
When is unbounded, we use Lpoc(&) as a space in which every function is p- 
integrable over any bounded subset of . One can show from the functional analysis 
that Lpoc(&.) is a Banach space under the above norm (see [5]).
In the above definition, the integration is defined as a Lebesgue integral. If one 
does not have the knowledge of the measure theory, one may use the Riemann integral 
instead. It is clear that all piecewise-bounded continuous functions are in Lp(&). 
Note that every function in Lp(&) represents a class of functions as long as their 
norms are the same. In the measure theory, we say two functions are equal except for 
a set of points where the Lebesgue measure of the set is equal to 0.
Unless indicated in the context, in this book a function sequence fn(x) in a Ba­
nach space that is convergent to f(x) means
|| fn - f ||^ 0, 
as n ^ TO.
For example, in C(^), the convergence of a function sequence means a uniform 
convergence on £2.
There are some important inequalities that are used frequently in the analysis of 
PDEs.
Proposition 2.2.1. (Holder’s inequality and Minkowski’s inequality)
(a) Let p,q > 1 and f e Lp(&) and g e Lq(&.). Then,
|| fg ||1 <|| f || p || g || q,

34 CHAPTER 2 Function spaces and the Fredholm Alternative
where
1+1=1.
pq
Moreover, the equality holds if and only if one function is a multiple of another func­
tion.
(b) Let p 1, • • • ,pk > 1 and
— + ••• + — = 1.
p1 
pk
Then, for f e Lp (O), i = 1, ••• ,k,
|| f1 ••• fk 11l <|| fill p 1 •••Il fk || Pk.
(c) Let p > 1. For any f(x), g(x) e Lp(&),
||f+g||p<||f||p+||g||p.
The proof is left as an exercise.
When p = 2, we can define an inner product. Let f(x'), g(x) e L2(Q), define
<f,g>:= f (x)g(x)dx.
One can verify that the above inner product satisfies the axioms in Definition 2.1.1. 
Hence, L2 (Q) is a Hilbert space. The proof can be found in a standard textbook of 
functional analysis such as [6].
Definition 2.2.2. (a) Two functions f(x), g(x) e L2(Q) are said to be orthogonal, if
<f,g >= f (x)g(x)dx = 0.
(b) A subset M of L2 (Q) is said to be mutually orthogonal if
<f,g >= f (x)g(x)dx = 0
for any distinct functions f(x'), g(x') e M c L2(Q).
(c) A function sequence f1 (x), •• • ,fn(x), •••, in L2 (Q) is said to be orthonormal 
if the set
M ={f1 (x), f2 (x), ••• fn(x), •••}
is mutually orthogonal in L2 (Q) and || fn || = 1, n = 1,2, • ••.

2.2 Function spaces 35
Example 2.2 .1. Prove each of the following sets is mutually orthogonal.
M 1 = {1, cos (----- ), sin (----- ), n = 1, 2, ■ ■■ .} are orthogonal in L2 (—a, a).
aa
M2 = {sin((nnx), n = 1, 2,...} are orthogonal in L2(0,a). 
a
M3 = {cos(nLx), n = o, 1,2,...} are orthogonal in L2(0,a). 
a
Proof. We recall the following trigonometric identities:
sin a sin ft = ||cos (a — ft) — cos (a + ft) ]; 
sin a cos ft = 2 [sin (a — ft) + sin (a + ft) ];
cos a cos ft = 2 [cos (a — ft) + cos (a + ft) ].
By using these identities one can easily verify the desired results.
□
Remark 2.2.1. It will be seen in Section 2.4 that M1 forms an orthogonal basis for 
the Hilbert space L2(—a, a), while M2 or M3 forms an orthogonal basis for L2(0, a).
In some applications, one may need to extend the inner product space L2 (Q) 
with a weight function. Let w(x) > 0 be positive except for a small set E with zero- 
Lebesgue measure. For any f, g e L2 (Q), define the inner product
<f,g>w = f (x)g(x)w(x)dx.
One can verify that < •, • >w is indeed an inner product (see Exercise 2.5). This space 
is denoted by L2(Q, w).
The next example comes from special function theory. These special functions 
are used in Chapter 3.
Example 2.2 .2. Define a Bessel function sequence Jm(x) over [0, rc>) as the follow­
ing:
(—1)n
( —1 )n 
/ X X2n + m
mx 
n! r( 1 + m + n)\2/
n=0
where the r-function is defined by
r(m) = [ xme—Xdx. 
0
When m > 0, the series is convergent on [0, rc>). When m < 0, then the series is 
convergent on (0, <x>).

36 CHAPTER 2 Function spaces and the Fredholm Alternative
The Bessel function is derived from the series solution for the ordinary differential 
equation (see reference [16] for example):
x2y" + xy' + (x2 - m2)y = 0.
We will see in Chapter 5 that the result of Example 2.2.2 is used to find a solution of 
the wave equation in a disk.
The Bessel functions {Jm(x), m = 0, 1, 2, •• •} are mutually orthogonal on [0,a] 
with a weight function w(x) = x. A direct proof is quite complicated. It will be 
seen that these special function sequences are eigenfunctions of certain eigenvalue 
problems and the orthogonality for eigenfunctions is just one of the properties (see 
the Sturm-Liouville theorem in Chapter 3).
2.2.4 Approximation for functions
As indicated in the previous subsection a function in L1 (Q) may be approximated by 
a sequence of smooth functions. Define 
n(x) =
kexP {-i—xjT },
0,
if jx j < 1, 
if | x |> 1,
where the constant k is chosen such that
n(x)dx = 1.
Rn
The function n(x) is called a mollifier. Let s > 0. Define 
ne(x) = s - nn(x).
s
Then, 
ns(x)dx = 1, 
ns(x) = 0, 
if |x|> s.
Rn
For any function f(x) e L1 (Rn), we define the convolution
(ns * f)(x) = j ns(x - y)f(y)dy.
Clearly, (ns * f )(x) has a compact support if f (x) has a compact support in Rn.
Theorem 2.2.1. Let f (x) e Ll1oc(Rn). Then,
(i) (ne * f)(x) e C~ (Rn);
(ii) ns * f(x) e Lp(Q) 
if 
f(x) e Lp(Q),
11 ns * f (x) — f 11 p ^ 0 ass ^ 0;
(iii) ns * f(x) ^ f(x) uniformly in K for any compact K c ^, 
if f(x) is continuous in ^.

2.2 Function spaces 37
Proof. We give a proof for (iii). The rest of the proofs are left as exercises. Let K c 
be compact. Then,
I(n * f)(x) - f(x)| = [
R (ns(x - y)[f (y) - f(x)]dy
Rn
< sup | f(x) - f(y) |^ 0
I x - y I <e
uniformly as e ^ 0.

2.2.5 Sobolev spaces Wk,p(ti), Hk(tt), and Lq((0,T); X)
Sobolev space plays an essential role in the study of advanced partial differential 
equations. There are several books about the theory of this space (for examples, see 
monographs [1,23]). However, in this book we use it occasionally in dealing with 
the existence theory for a PDE problem. The reader may find more materials in Ap­
pendix B for the basic concept. The theory of Sobolev space is very interesting. This 
part may be skipped for beginners.
Let k > 1 be an integer and p > 1. Let be a bounded domain with a smooth 
boundary. Define
Wk,p(^) := {f(x) e Lp(O): || f ||Wk,p(Q) < M,
where
||f ||W 
:= £ ||Dmf ||Lp&).
Wk,p(^) can be considered as the closure of Ck(Q) under the Wk,m-norm.
Wkp(Q) = closure of C0(Q) under the Wk,p-norm.
When p = 2, then Wk,2 (Q) is a Hilbert space with the inner product
<f,g>:= L <Dmf,Dmg>.
In this case, we use
Hk(Q) := Wk2(^), 
H0k(Q) := Wk,2(Q).
In dealing with time-dependent evolution equations, one needs to define a func­
tion from [0, T] to a Banach space X. Here is an example. Let X be a Banach space 
and p > 1.
Lp(( 0 ,T); X) := {all functions from [0 ,T ] to X with || f || Lp(( 0 ,t) ; X) < ^},

38 CHAPTER 2 Function spaces and the Fredholm Alternative
where
||f ||LP((0,T);X) :={jT II f IIpxdt}1 •
When X = Lp(&), we simply use
Lp(QT) := Lp((0,T); Lp(O)),
where QT = x (0,T].
The following compactness result is often used in the book.
Theorem 2.2.2. (Aubin-Lions lemma) Let X0, X, and X 1 be three Banach spaces 
with X0 c X c X 1. Suppose that X0 is compactly embedded in X and that X is 
continuously embedded in X 1. For 1 < p,q < <x>. Let
W = {u e Lp([0,T]; X0) | u e Lq([0,T]; X1)}•
(i) If p < rc>, then the embedding of W into Lp([0,T]; X) is compact.
(ii) If p = rc> and q > 1 then the embedding of W into C([0,T]; X)) is compact.
The reader may find its proof in [28].
2.2.6 Linear independence and the Gram-Schmidt process
We extend the concept of linear independence in linear algebra into infinite­
dimensional function space.
Definition 2.2.3. We say a set of functions
M = { fk(x),x e Q : k = 1,2, ■■■}
is linearly independent on , if for any m > 1 and
k 1 f1 (x) + k2f2(x) +------+ kmfm(x) = 0, 
x e Q,
implies k 1 = k2 = •• • = km = 0.
Example 2.2.3. The function set M = {1 ,x,x2, ••• ,xm, •• •} is linearly independent 
at any interval (a, b).
Proof. Suppose there exist constants k 1, • •• ,km such that
k 1 + k2x + • • • + kmxm = 0, 
x e (a, b)^
From the fundamental theorem of algebra we know that an mth-order polynomial 
has m roots. However, we have an infinite number of x e (a, b) that satisfy the equa­
tion. This is a contradiction unless all coefficients are equal to 0. It follows that the 
functions in M are linearly independent.

2.2 Function spaces 39
This example shows that the dimension of a function space such as C“ (Q) is 
infinite. Similar to the property in linear algebra, one can show that an orthogonal set 
in a Hilbert space must be linearly independent.
Proposition 2.2.2. Let M\{0} be a set of functions that are mutually orthogonal in a 
Hilbert space H . Then, any sequence in M is linearly independent.
Proof. Let K = {fk(x), x e }“=1 be any mutually orthogonal subset of M. Suppose
k 1 f 1 (x) +----- + kmfm(x) = 0, 
X e ^.
If we take an inner product to the equation with fi for each i = 1, 2, ■ ■■ ,m, we obtain
ki <fi,fi >= 0.
It follows that ki = 0 ,i = 1,2, ■ ■■ ,m, which implies that K is linearly independent. 
Consequently, M is linearly independent. 
□
Example 2.2.4. Any subsequence in M1, M2 or M3 from Example 2.2.1 is linearly 
independent.
From linear algebra, we can construct a set of orthonormal vectors from a set of 
linearly independent vectors. This process is called the Gram-Schmidt process. For 
a Hilbert space, we can use the same process to construct an orthonormal set from a 
linearly independent set of functions.
Gram-Schmidt process. Let M = {f 1 (x), • • • ,fm(x), ■ ■■ .} be linearly independent 
in a Hilbert space H.
Step 1: Let f 1 (x) = f 1 (x).
Step 2: Set f 2(x) = f 2(x) — c 1 f 1 (x), where c 1 is chosen such that < f 2,f 1 > = 0.
It follows that
< f1 , f2 > 
c 1 =-------------------.
<f1,f1 >
Step 3: Set f3 = f3 — c1f1(x) — c2f2(x), where c1 and c2 are chosen such that 
<f1,f3 >=< f2,f3 >=0.
We can easily solve for c1 and c2:
<f1 ,f3 > 
<f2,f3 >
c 1 =--------------; c 2 =-------------- .
<f1,f1 > 
<f2,f2 >
Step 4: Continuing this process, we obtain a new set of mutually orthogonal sets
M* = {f 1 (x), ••• ,fm(x), •••}, 
where
k—1 
<fi,fk >
fk(x) = fk(x) — V cifi(x), 
ci =----- ]----- ,------,k = 1,2, ••• .
i=1 
<fi,fi >
Step 5: Dividing the norm of each function in M* yields an orthonormal set.

40 CHAPTER 2 Function spaces and the Fredholm Alternative
Example 2.2.5. Use the Gram-Schmidt process to construct an orthonormal function 
sequence from the polynomial set M := {1 ,x,x2 ,x3, ■■■ .} in [0, 1].
Solution. Let fi(x) = xl -1 for all i > 1.
Step 1: We choose
g 1 (x) = f1 (x) = 1, x e[0, 1].
Step 2: We set
g2(x) = f2(x) - c1g1,
where c1 is chosen such that <g1,g2 >= 0.
That is,
g1 (x)g2(x)dx = 0.
0
It follows that
1 
[x - c1]dx = 0.
0
Hence, c 1 = 2 and g2(x) = x — j.
Step 3: We set
g3(x) = f3(x) — c1g1(x) — c2g2(x), 
where c1 , c2 are chosen such that
<g1,g3 >= 0,<g2,g3 >= 0.
An elementary calculation gives
1 
c 1 = 3 ,c 2 = 1
and
g 3 (x) = x2 — (x — 1) — 1 = x2 — x + 1.
23 
6
We can continue this process to obtain an orthogonal set of functions {gm(x)}. An 
orthonormal sequence can be obtained immediately by dividing the norm of each 
gk(x).
2.3 Completeness and series representation
In linear algebra, an n-dimensional vector can be expressed as a linear combination 
ofanyn basis vectors. In this section we extend this concept into infinite-dimensional 
function spaces. A Banach space may not have accountable basis in general. How­
ever, a separable Banach space does have an accountable basis.

2.3 Completeness and series representation
41
2.3.1 Bessel’s inequality and Parseval’s equality
A Banach space is said to be separable if there exists an accountable set E c B 
such that the closure E = B. Most function spaces in applications such as Lp(&) are 
separable. However, lto is not separable.
Definition 2.3.1. We say M := {v 1, ••• ,vm, • • •} c V is a basis (also called com­
plete) of a Banach space V if M is linearly independent and every u e V can be 
approximated by a sequence un in subspace Vn = span{v1, v2, ••• , vn}:
lim ||u-un||=0, 
n ^to
where

un := 
ckvk,

ck e R 1 ,n = 1, 2, •• • .
If M c V is complete, then any u e V can be expressed as a series:
to
u
ckvk, 
k=1
ck e R1.
For a Hilbert space H,ifM c H is an orthonormal basis of H, then
ck =<u,vk >, 
k= 1, 2, ••• .
Let be a bounded domain in Rn.
Let M = {$ 1 (x), •• • ,<pn(x), • • •} be an orthonormal sequence in L2(Q). A natu­
ral question to ask is whether every function in L2 (Q) can be expressed as a linear 
combination of {$n(x), n = 1, 2, • • •}. A different way is to ask whether or not M 
forms a basis for the space L2 (Q).
To answer the question, we consider the following function with parameters 
d1 ,d2 , ••• ,dm :
D(d1,d2, •
m
• ,dm) := J [f(x) - 
difii(x)]2dx,
where di e R1, i = 1, 2, ••• ,m.
Using the orthogonality, we see that
D(d1,d2, •
f (x)2dx -
m „

2di J f(x)<fa(x)dx + 
d2.
It follows that

k = 1,2, • • • ,m.
Consequently, the function D(d 1, ■■■ ,dm) attains its minimum if and only if
dk = Ck, 
k = 1, ■ ■■ ,m.
Proposition 2.3.1. Let M = {fk}k=1 be an orthonormal sequence in L2 (Q). Then, 
for any f(x) e L2 (^), the following inequality holds:
to

Proof. Since D(d 1 ,d2, ■■■ ,m) is nonnegative, it follows that

Since the right-hand side of the above inequality is independent of m, let m ^ <x>, 
we see that

Theorem 2.3.1. Let {fk(x)} k=1 be a function sequence that is orthonormal in L2 (Q).

rem. Then,

2.3 Completeness and series representation
It follows that fn(x') converges to f (x) in the sense of an L2(&.)-norm if and only if
to
f (x)2dx =
ck2 
k=1
Proposition 2.3.2. There exists an orthonormal basis for L2 (Q).
The proof of the proposition is due to the fact that L2 (Q) is separable and every 
function in L2(Q) can be approximated by a polynomial in L2-sense (see [5]).
2.3.2 Series representation of functions
The motivation for a function representation comes from a superposition principle. 
To find a solution of a PDE problem, we first seek a series function just like a series 
solution in terms of power series for ODEs. For a partial differential equation it turns 
out that a power series is not a suitable series solution due to some boundary con­
ditions. A new series in terms of trigonometric functions or eigenfunctions is used 
instead of a power-series solution.
It is often difficult to prove that a set of orthogonal functions forms a basis for 
L2 (Q). However, we will prove a general theorem that implies all linearly indepen­
dent eigenfunctions for a self-adjoint elliptic operator form a basis for L2(Q). This 
result is very useful in the study of partial differential equations.
Suppose
M = {fa(x),x g Q}£1
forms an orthonormal basis in L2(Q). Then, for any function f(x) g L2(Q), we can 
express f(x) in terms of the basis functions in M. Let
TO
f(x) = ^2nnx)n(x), 
n=1
x g ^.
If we take an inner product by $k(x) in the representation, we see that
ck = 
f(x)^k(x)dx, 
k = 1,2, ••• .
We would like to emphasize that the above equality holds in L2-sense.
Remark 2.3.1. In the 1990s, the wavelet theory played a special role in modern 
telecommunication (digital revolution). The idea behind this revolution is due to the 
introduction of a special class of function basis (called wavelets). This class of basis 
functions can be used to approximate high-frequency signals much more accurately, 
which in turn makes television pictures and other graphics much clearer than analog 
signals (Fourier modes).

44 CHAPTER 2 Function spaces and the Fredholm Alternative
2.4 Fourier series
In this section we focus on a special class of functions that forms a basis of the 
function space L2 (Q). The set of basis functions consists of simple trigonometric 
functions. For this special class of basis, the representation of a function is called a 
Fourier series.
2.4.1 Fourier series
We begin with a simple case where the dimension is equal to one. For simplicity, we 
choose a = n in the function sets M 1, M2, and M3 in Example 2.2.1. Let
M1 = {1, cos(nx), sin(nx): n = 1,2, • • •}.
We already know from the previous section that M1 is mutually orthogonal in 
(—n, n). We will see in Chapter 3 that M 1 forms a basis for L2 (-n, n). It follows 
that any function in L2 (—n, n) can be expressed by the trigonometric functions in 
M1.
Let

f(x)=a0+
[an cos(nx) + bn sin(nx)].

an = 
f(x) cos(nx)dx,
n J—n
bn = 
f(x) sin (nx)dx, 
n = 1, 2, ■ ■■ .
- -n n
The coefficients {an, bn} are called the Fourier coefficients of function f (x). More­
over, from Parseval’s identity, we have the following property: for any f (x) e 
L 2 (—n,n),
lim f(x) sin(nx)dx = lim 
f (x) cos(nx)dx = 0.

Theorem 2.4 .1. Every function f(x) e L2 (—n,n ) can be expressed as a Fourier 
series (2.4.1). Moreover, the Fourier series fn(x) converges to f(x) in L2-sense.

fn(x) =

Dn(X,t) =

From (2.4.2), we see that

A central question in Fourier analysis is whether or not the Fourier series con­
verges to the original function in a stronger norm than the L2-norm. Let

Theorem 2.4 .2. Let f(x) e L2(—,, tt).

2.4.2 Fourier sine series and Fourier cosine series
In some applications we may need some special Fourier series.
Let f(x) be defined on [0,n]. If we take an even extension for f(x) to (—n, n) 
by
O . . 
...
f (x) = f(—x), 
x e (—n, 0).
Then, f (x) is defined on (—n, n). We can express f (x) as a Fourier series:
o
f (x) = ao + 3"2[an cos(nx) + bn sin(nx)].
n=1
Note that f (x) is an even function on (—n, n), we see that
bn = 0, 
n = 1, 2, • •• .
It follows that
o
f(x) = ao + 
an cos(nx), 
x e (0,n),
n=1
where
a o = — f f(x')dx,an = — f f(x) cos (nx)dx, 
n = 1, ■ ■■ .
n o 
n o
The above representation f(x) is called a Fourier cosine series.
Similarly, we take an odd extension of f (x) to (—n, 0) by
o . . 
...
f (x) = — f( — x), 
x e (—n, 0).
Then,
an = 0, 
n = 0, 1, 2, ••• .
It follows that

f(x) = bn sin(nx), x e [0,n],

2.4 Fourier series 47
where
bn = —[ f(x') sin (nx)dx, n = 1, • •• .

This representation of f(x) is called a Fourier sine series. One can easily extend 
the Fourier series into any interval (-L, L) by using a new variable
y = — x.

2.4.3 Fourier series in higher dimension
The Fourier series can be extended to higher dimension. We use two-dimensional 
sine series as an example.
Theorem 2.4.3. Let D = [0 ,L] x [0 ,H] e R2 be a rectangle. Then, the function set
M4 = {sin (n^x) sin (my), n,m = 1, 2, • • •}

forms an orthogonal basis for L2 (D).
Proof. We know that {sin(nLx), n = 1, 2, • • •} forms a basis for L2(0,L). It follows

By using the same idea, we can easily construct a Fourier basis for a rectangular

tion of a Fourier basis is much more complicated (see Chapter 3).
2.5 The contraction mapping principle and applications
In the study of partial differential equations, the solvability for a PDE problem is 
one of the central questions for the justification of a physical model. The contraction 
mapping principle is a powerful tool used in research. The method can be used to 
deal with some nonlinear problems.

2.5 The contraction mapping principle and applications 49
2.5.1 The contraction mapping principle
A mapping M from a Banach space V into V is called a contraction mapping if there 
exists a constant 0 e (0, 1) such that
|| M [ u ]-M [ v ]||< 01| u - v ||, 
V u,v e V.
Clearly, a contraction mapping must be continuous.
Theorem 2.5.1. There exists a unique fixed point for every contraction mapping in a 
Banach space.
Proof. Let u0 e V be any fixed point in V. We define a sequence {un} by
Un+1 = M [ Un ], 
n = 0, 1,2, ••• .
We claim {un} is a Cauchy sequence. Indeed, from the definition for any n > 1 we 
see that
|| un+1 — un || = || M [ un] — M [ un -1]|| < 0 || un — un -1 || < • • • < 0n ||u 1 — u 0 ||.
Next, for any n, m > 1 with n > m, we use the triangle inequality to obtain
n
||un - um|| < 
||uj - uj -1||
j =m+1
n
< 
0j-11|u 1 -u0||
j =m+1
< || u 1 - u 0|| 0m 
1 - 0
^ 0,
as m ^ rc>.
Since V is a Banach space, we see {un } must converge to an element, denoted by 
u e V. Since the mapping M is continuous, it follows that
u = lim un+1 = lim M[un] = M[u], 
n ^to 
n ^to
i.e., u is a fixed point of the mapping M. Uniqueness is obvious.
□
The method used in the proof of Theorem 2.5.1 is called the successive iteration 
method. One can use this method to find a numerical approximation for a nonlin­
ear PDE problem. The method also gives a way to estimate the error between the 
approximate solution un and the actual solution u:
0n
|| u - un || < 1-0 II u 1 - u 0||.
This is particularly useful when dealing with a nonlinear problem.

50 CHAPTER 2 Function spaces and the Fredholm Alternative
2.5.2 Some applications
To illustrate the application of the contraction mapping principle, we give two exam­
ples here. The first one deals with the solvability of a linear integral equation. The 
other is concerned with a system of nonlinear ODEs.
Example 2.5 .1. Solvability for a linear integral equation.
Let f(x') e L2(Q). Consider an integral equation: Find u(x) e L2(Q) such that
u(x) = f(x) + K(x, y)u(y)dy, 
(2.5.1)
where K(x, y) is given (called a kernel) in L2 (Q x Q) and X is a constant.
We choose V = L2 (Q). For any u e L2 (Q), define
M[u]:=f(x)+ X 
K(x, y)u(y)dy.
Then, M is a contraction mapping if
0 := y K(x,y)2dxdy < 1.
It follows that the integral equation (2.5.1) has a unique solution u(x) e L2(Q) if 
0<1. Moreover, one can construct a successive sequence un(x) as follows: Choose 
u0(x) = f(x) and
Un +1 (x) = M[Un] = f(x) + j K(x,y)un(y)dy, 
n = 0, 1, ••• .
We know that un(x) must converge to a function u(x) e L2(Q) that is the unique 
solution of the integral equation (2.5.1). Moreover, one can obtain the error estimate 
||Un - U||2 as long as 0 can be estimated.
Example 2.5 .2. Solvability for a nonlinear system of ODEs.
Let f(t, U) be defined on R+1 x R1 be continuous with respect to t and Lipschitz 
continuous with respect to U:
| f (t, u) — f(t, v)| < Mo|u — v|, 
Vu, v e R1 ,t e R +,
where M0 is a constant.
Consider the following initial-value problem:
y'(t) = f(t,y(t)), 
t> 0, 
(2.5.2)
y(0) = y0. 
(2.5.3)
It is clear that the solution y(t) satisfies the following integral equation:
y(t) = y0 + j f(T,y(t))dt. 
(2.5.4)

2.5 The contraction mapping principle and applications 51
We choose
V = L “ (0 ,K),
where K will be determined later.
Define a mapping M from V into V as follows:
M[y(t)] = y0 + j f(T,y(T))dT.
We choose T0 such that 0 := M0T0 < 1. Then, for all u(t), v(t) e V,
||M[u]- M[v]|| < M0T0||u(t) - v(t)||.
Now, we choose
1 
k = । y o| +1—0 ii y1 — yo|| •
Then, M [yn] e V for all n > 1. The contraction mapping principle implies that the 
nonlinear problem (2.5.2)-(2.5.3) has a unique solution y(t) on [0,T0]. Since y(t) e 
V and f (t, u) are continuous, from the integral equation ofy(t) we see that y(t) must 
be continuous on [0, T0]. If we go back to the integral equation (2.5.4) for y(t), we 
see that y(t) must be differentiable on [0, T0]. Hence, y(t) satisfies the differential 
equation (2.5.2). For T = 2M^,
|y|l^(o,t) < |yo| + TMo|y|l^(0,t) + F0T,
where F0 = maxte[0,T] |f (t, 0)|.
It follows that
F0
|y|l^(o,t) < 2(|yo| + M).
We can start with t = T0 as an initial time and solve the ODE (2.5.2)-(2.5.3) to 
obtain a solution [0, 2T0]. By using the Gronwall’s inequality, we see that y(t) is 
bounded in any bounded interval [0,T] for T>0. By repeating this process, we can 
obtain a global solution y(t) e C1 [0, ^).
Define a successive sequence yn(t) as follows:
yn+1 (t) = y0 + j f (t,yn(T))dT, 
n = 0, 1, ••• .
One can obtain an approximate solution yn(t) and an error estimate as long as 0 can 
be estimated. It is easy to see that the method can be extended to deal with a system 
of nonlinear ODEs (see Chapter 9).

52
CHAPTER 2 Function spaces and the Fredholm Alternative
2.6 The continuity method
In this section we introduce the method of continuity as another application of the 
contraction mapping principle. The basic idea of the method is that one can answer 
the solvability question for a linear PDE problem if the problem is connected contin­
uously to the other problem in which the solvability of the problem is known, as long 
as some a priori estimates can be proved for the PDE problem. The generalization of 
this method is Leray-Schauder’s fixed-point theorem, which is a powerful tool used 
in the study of solvability for nonlinear PDE problems.
Let (V11| • ||1) and (V2, || • ||2) be Banach spaces. A mapping M from V1 to V2 is 
said to be linear if
M [ k 1 u 1 + k 2 u 2 ] = k 1M [ u 1] + k 2 M [ u 2 ], 
V u 1 ,u 2 e V1 ,k 1 ,k2 e R1.
M is said to be bounded if there exists a constant K such that
||M[u]||2 < K||u||1, 
Vu e V1.
Similar to the definition in linear algebra, M is said to be one-to-one if M[u1] = 
M[u2] implies u1 = u2. M is said to be onto if for every v e V2 there exists an 
element u e V1 such that M[u]=v.IfM is one-to-one and onto (bijection), then 
the inverse mapping of M exists. All of the bounded linear mapping forms a normed 
space with a norm defined by
||M || = sup
ueV1,u=0
|| M [ u ]||2 
|| u ||1
One can easily verify that a bounded linear mapping must be continuous.
Let L0 and L1 be bounded linear operators from V1 to V2. Define a linear operator 
Lt as follows:
Lt = (1 - t)L0 + tL1, 
0 < t < 1.
Itis clear that Lt is a bounded linear operator from V1 to V2 for all t e[0, 1]. Suppose 
we know that for every f e V2 , a linear equation
L0[u] = f
has a solution u e V1, what conditions are needed such that
L1[u] = f
also has a solution? The following theorem answers this question.
Theorem 2.6.1. Let the linear operator Lt be defined as above. Suppose that there 
exists a constant C0 such that
||u||1 < C0||Lt[u]||2, 
Vte[0,1]. 
(2.6.1)
Then, the operator L1 maps V1 onto V2 if and only if L0 maps V1 onto V2.

2.6 The continuity method 53
Proof. First, the estimate (2.6.1) implies that the operator Lt is one-to-one for all 
t e [0, 1]. It follows that the inverse operator L- exists and is also a bounded linear 
one. Suppose that Ls is onto for some s e [0, 1]. Then, for any v e V2, the equation
Lt[u]=v
is equivalent to
Ls[u] = v + (Ls - Lt)[u] = v + (t - s)L0[u] - (t - s)L1 [u].
Since Ls-1 exists, we see that
u = Ls- [v]+(t - s)Ls- (L0 - L1 )[u].
Define a mapping M : V2 ^ V1 as follows:
M[u]:= Ls-1[v] + (t - s)Ls-1(L0 - L1)[u].
Then,
||M[u 1] - M[u2]||2 < |t - s|C01|u 1 - u21| 1, 
where
Co = ||L-1 (Lo - L1)|| < rc.
Now, if t is sufficiently close to s such that
9 := 11 - s |Co < 1,
then the mapping M is contractive from V2 into V1, which implies that M has a fixed 
point. Consequently, Lt is invertible as long as 11 - s | C0 < 1. Therefore for t e [0, | ], 
Lt is an onto mapping if L0 is an onto mapping. After a finite number of steps, we 
see that L1 is an onto mapping. 
□
To illustrate the application of the continuity method, we consider two Poisson 
equations:
L o[ u ] := - Au = f(x), x e ^, 
u(x) = 0, x e d&,
(2.6.2)
(2.6.3)
and
nn
L1[u]:= - 
aij (x)uxixj + 
bi (x)uxi + c(x)u = f (x),
i,j =1 
i=1
x e ^,
u(x) = 0,
x e dQ,
(2.6.4)
(2.6.5) 

54 CHAPTER 2 Function spaces and the Fredholm Alternative
where the coefficients of Eq. (2.6.4) are assumed to be in C“(Q).
Choose V1 = C2+“(Q) and V2 = C“(S3) for some a e (0, 1). It is clear that L0 
and L1 are linear and bounded operators in V1 . Define
Lt = (1 — t)Lo + tL 1, 
0 < t < 1.
Suppose we know that for every f(x)e V2, there exists a unique solution u e V1 for 
the problem (2.6.2)-(2.6.3). This implies that the operator L0 from V1 into V2 is an 
onto mapping.
For all t e[0, 1], ifwe have the following estimate
||u||V1 < C||Lt[u]||v2, 
(2.6.6)
where C is a constant that depends only on known data.
Then, the continuity method implies that the problem (2.6.4)-(2.6.5) has a unique 
solution u(x) e V1 for every f(x)e V2.
The crucial step in this example is to derive the estimate (2.6.6), which is called 
an a priori estimate. It is often difficult to derive such an a priori estimate. Many of 
these estimates need very delicate analysis. The interested reader may find such an 
estimate in Schauder’s theory (see the advanced PDE book [12]).
2.7 The Fredholm Alternative and applications
In this section we state an important theorem related to a compact operator. Some 
examples are given to illustrate the application of the theorem.
2.7.1 The Fredholm Alternative
First, we need to define a compact operator.
Definition 2.7.1. Let X and Y be Banach spaces. An operator
K : X ^ Y
is said to be compact if for every bounded sequence {un} c X, the set {Kun} is 
precompact in Y, i.e., the sequence {Kun} has a convergent subsequence in Y.
For a Hilbert space H, we can define an adjoint operator K* by
< Ku, v >=< u, K*v >, u, v, e H.
K is called self-adjoint if K = K*.
An interesting property is that K* is compact if and only if K is compact.
Proposition 2.7.1. Let K : H ^ H be a linear operator. Then, the operator K is 
compact if and only if the adjoint operator K* is compact.

2.7 The Fredholm Alternative and applications 55
The proof is directly from the definition. We leave it as an exercise.
Definition 2.7.2. (a) For an operator K : H ^ H, if there exists a number X and a 
nonzero vector u e H such that
Ku = Xu, 
(2.7.1)
then we say X is an eigenvalue of K and u is the corresponding eigenvector. Define
a(K) = {all eigenvalues of the operator K}.
NX(K) = span{all eigenvectors corresponding to an eigenvalue X}.
The set a(K) is called the spectrum of the operator K. NX(K) is called the eigenspace 
corresponding to the eigenvalue X. Clearly, NX(K) is a subspace of H.
Let I: H ^ H be an identity mapping. Eq. (2.7.1) can be rewritten as
(K - XI)u = 0. 
(2.7.2)
Define the null space for the operator XI - K:
Ker(XI - K) ={u e H : (XI - K)u = 0.} = NX(K).
The following theorem is a generalization from linear algebra.
Theorem 2.7.1. Let H be a Hilbert space and K : H ^ H be a bounded linear 
operator and compact. Then, for any X e R1, either (XI - K) is invertible and for 
every f e H the equation
(XI - K)u = f
has a unique solution u = (XI - K)-1 f or X e a(K) and the equation
(XI - K)u = f
has a solution if and only if f e NX(K)±. Moreover, when X e a(K), the following 
statements hold:
(a) Ker(I - XK) is finite dimensional;
(b) R(XI - K) is closed;
(c) R(XI - K) = N(XI - K)±;
(d) Ker(XI - K *) = 0 if and only if R(XI - K) = H ;
(e) dimN(XI - K) = dimN(XI - K*).
The proof can be found in Functional Analysis, such as in [6].
From Theorem 2.7.1, we immediately have the following consequence.
Corollary 2.7.1. (a) If K is compact, then a(K) is a compact subset of R1 and the 
only possible limit point in a(K) is 0. Moreover, a(K) c [-|| K ||, || K ||].
(b) dimNX(K) is finite.

56 CHAPTER 2 Function spaces and the Fredholm Alternative
For any number ^ e R \ a(K), the operator (K — ^I) is invertible in H .It follows 
that for every f e H, there exists a unique u e H such that
u = (K — pI)-1 f.
One can see the compactness of the operator K plays an essential role in solving an 
equation in an infinite-dimensional space. The existence for an ODE or PDE problem 
relies on the compactness property of the corresponding inverse operator.
2.7.2 Applications
In this subsection we give two examples to demonstrate how the Fredholm Alterna­
tive can be applied to solve linear equations.
Example 2.7.1. Let f(x) e L2(Q). Consider an integral equation: Find u(x) e 
L2 (Q) such that
u(x) = f(x) + K(x, y)u(y)dy, 
(2.7.3)
where K(x, y) = K(y, x) are given in L2(Q x Q) and X is a constant.
It is known from Section 2.5 that the integral equation (2.7.3) has a unique solu­
tion u(x) if XK0 < 1, where
K0 = 
K(x, y)2dxdy.
When this condition is violated, does the integral equation have a solution for any 
f(x) e L2(Q)?
To answer the question, we define an operator M0 as follows:
Mo : u(x) e L2(Q) ^ v(x) = Mo[u]= I K(x, y)u(y)dy.
to
It is easy to verify that M0 is self-adjoint since K(x, y) = K(y, x).
Suppose the operator M0 is compact, then by the Fredholm Alternative, the in­
tegral equation (2.7.3) has a solution u(x) for any f(x) e L2(Q) if X is not an 
eigenvalue of M0. On the other hand, if X is an eigenvalue of K, then the integral 
equation (2.7.3) has a solution for every f(x) e NS where
NX := {u(x) e L2(Q): Mo[u] = Xu}.
This gives a completed answer for the solvability of the integral equation (2.7.3) as 
long as K is compact.
There are several different sets of conditions that can ensure the compactness of 
the operator M0. For example, when K(x, y) = K(y,x) is continuous in fix £2, then 
the operator M0 is compact by using Arzela-Ascoli’s theorem (see [5]).

2.8 The Riesz representation and the Lax-Milgram theorem 57
Example 2.7.2. Consider the Laplace equation:
Lo[u] := — Au = ku + f(x), 
u(x) = 0, x e d&,
x e ^,
(2.7.4)
(2.7.5)
where k > 0 is a constant.
We denote by K the inverse operator ofL0 associated with the Dirichlet boundary 
condition (2.7.5). Note that, if k = 0,
L0[u] = ku
<>
1
K [ u ] = — u. 
k
Since the operator L0 is self-adjoint, its inverse operator K is also self-adjoint.
Suppose K is a compact operator from L2 (Q) to L2 (Q). Then, we consider two 
cases:
Case 1: ^ := 1 is not an eigenvalue of K.
For this case, the boundary value problem (2.7.4)-(2.7.5) has a solution for all 
f (x) e L2(Q) by using the Fredholm Alternative. Namely, if k is not an eigenvalue of 
L0 associated with a Dirichlet boundary condition, then the boundary value problem 
(2.7.4)-(2.7.5) is solvable for all f(x) e L2(Q).
Case 2: ^ := 1 is an eigenvalue of K (equivalently, k = 1 is an eigenvalue of L0).
Let
N, := {u(x) e L2(Q): K[u] = ^u}.
Then, for any f (x) e N^, the boundary value problem (2.7.4)-(2.7.5) has a solu­
tion u(x). Namely, if k is an eigenvalue of L0 associated with a Dirichlet boundary 
condition, then the boundary value problem (2.7.4)-(2.7.5) is solvable if and only if
f(x) e N^.
The compactness of the operator K relies on the regularity theory for the solution 
of the Laplace equation, which will be discussed in Chapter 6.
2.8 The Riesz representation and the Lax-Milgram theorem
In this section we state two important theorems that are used in the study of partial 
differential equations. Recall that a mapping from a Banach space to R1 is called a 
functional. Define a new space
B' := {all bounded linear functionals from B to Rx}.
Then, B' is called the dual space of B. B' is a Banach space equipped with the norm
||L|| = sup 
|L[u]|.
ueB,||u||=1

58 CHAPTER 2 Function spaces and the Fredholm Alternative
Theorem 2.8 .1. (Riesz representation) Let H be a Hilbert space. Then, for every 
continuous linear functional L e H', there exists a unique vector v e H such that
L[u] = (u, v), Vu e H.
Moreover,
||L|| = ||v||.
With the Riesz representation theorem, we can define a mapping
M : L e H' ^ v = M [ L ] e H.
Then, M is linear and bijection. Hence, the dual space H' is isometric to H. We 
simply treat H and H' as identical. In this case, H is called reflexive.
Let H be a Hilbert space. Define a functional
B[u,v]: H x H ^ R1.
B[u, v] is said to be bilinear if B[u, v] is linear with respect to u and v in H.
With the help of the Riesz representation theorem, we can state the following 
theorem that is essential in the existence theory for linear partial differential equations 
of elliptic type.
Theorem 2.8 .2. (Lax-Milgram theorem) Let H be a Hilbert space and B[u, v] be a 
bilinear functional from H x H to R1. If there exist two constants p > 0 and M > 0 
such that
(a) 
B[u,u]> p||u||2, 
Vu e H,
(b) 
|B[u,v]|< M||u||||v||, 
Vu,v e H,
then, for every bounded linear functional f e H' there exists a unique u such that
B [u, v ]=<f, v >, 
Vv e H.
The condition (a) is called the coercive condition, while the condition (b) is the 
boundedness condition. It will be seen in Chapter 6 that the existence of a solution 
for an elliptic equation is equivalent to the verification of the conditions in the Lax- 
Milgram theorem. We give a simple example to illustrate the basic idea.
Example 2.8.1. Let f (x) e L2(Q). Consider the Laplace equation with a lower- 
order term:
— Au + a(x)u = f(x), x e ^, 
u(x) = 0, x e dQ.

2.10 Exercises 59
For any function u(x) e H01 (Q), we define an inner production
<u,v>:= j [Vu •Vv + uv]dx.
Define
B[u, v] = (Vu, Vv) + (a(x)u, v), Vu, v e H01 (^).
Then, we see that B [u, v] is bilinear. If B [u, v] satisfies the Lax-Milgram condi­
tions, then we obtain a solution in H01 (Q). Suppose a(x) e L“(Q) and a(x) > a0 
on for some constant a0 > 0. Then, one can easily verify that B [u, v] satisfies 
the Lax-Milgram conditions, which implies the problem has a solution for every 
f(x) e L2(Q). We will see more detail in Chapter 6.
2.9 Notes and remarks
Most materials in this chapter serve as an introduction or a review for students with 
or without the basic knowledge in functional analysis. Many concepts for Banach and 
Hilbert spaces are generalizations from the theory for a finite-dimensional space in 
linear algebra. Fourier series and function representations are interesting topics that 
have other applications in addition to the application in partial differential equations.
The materials from Sections 2.5 to 2.8 are some tools used to establish the exis­
tence theory for partial differential equations. Some of the tools can be used to deal 
with nonlinear equations. This part of the material is provided for students interested 
in theoretical analysis. For the beginners in PDEs, one may skip these sections with­
out much difficulty for the rest of the book.

3.1 The method of separation of variables
To find a solution for a PDE problem, one intends to use known methods and tools 
from the theory of ODEs. Hence, the separation of variables is introduced with the 
expectation that a function of one variable will satisfy an ODE in which its exact 
solution can be found from the ODE theory.
We use the heat equation as an example to illustrate the idea of the method. This 
equation will be investigated in detail in Chapter 4. Consider the heat equation with 
one-space dimension over interval [0, L]:
ut = k uxx,
0 <x<L,t>0,
(3.1.1)
where k is a positive constant.
Suppose that u(x , t) can be expressed by the product of two functions with a 
single variable:
u(x, t) h h(t)^(x),
0 <x<L,t>0,
where h(t) and $(x) are unknown functions.
From the heat equation (3.1.1), we see that
h'(t)<p(x) h k2h(t)$"(x),
0 <x<L,t>0.
It follows that
h'(t) _ 0"(x) 
k2h(t) $(x) '
0 <x<L,t>0.
(3.1.2)
Note that the left-hand side of Eq. (3.1.2) is a function oft, while the right-hand side 
is a function of x . Hence, each side must be equal to a constant (unknown). Suppose 
the unknown constant is equal to -X:
h’(t) h ^"(x) h -X 
k2 h(t) $(x) 
’
0 <x<L,t>0,
where the negative sign ofX is used for convenience.

64 CHAPTER 3 Eigenvalue problems and eigenfunction expansions
Consequently, we find that
h(t) = Ce-Xk2t, 
t> 0,
where C is an arbitrary constant.
Also, p(x) satisfies the following second-order ODE:
-p"(x) = Xp, 
0 <x<L, 
(3.1.3)
where the unknown constant X and p(x) need to be determined at the same time.
Eq. (3.1.3) with appropriate boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = L forms an 
eigenvalue problem for the differential operator Lo := dx2. We will see that the 
second-order ODE (3.1.3) with a boundary condition may not always have a non­
trivial solution for every constant X. When it does, X is called an eigenvalue and the 
corresponding solution p(x) is called an eigenfunction corresponding to X.
An eigenvalue problem for a general ODE is the topic of the next section, which 
is called the Sturm-Liouville theory. When the space dimension is more than 1, it is 
the general eigenvalue problem for the Laplace (or an elliptic) operator.
3.2 The Sturm-Liouville theory
With the basic knowledge in the theory of ODEs, we can solve the eigenvalue prob­
lem completely when the space dimension is equal to one. This is often referred to as 
the Sturm-Liouville theory in the literature.
3.2.1 Eigenvalue problems in one-space dimension
Let p(x) and q(x) be continuous functions on [a, b] with p(x) > 0on(a, b). Let L 
be the following differential operator,
L [ p ] :=
d 
dx
dp 
p(x)~p~ 
dx
+ q(x)p.
(3.2.1)
One can prove (see Exercise 3.1) that a general second-order linear ODE operator 
can always be expressed by the above form if one introduces a suitable integrating 
factor. To include some important applications, we consider an eigenvalue problem 
with a weight function.
Let p(x') be abounded, positive, and piecewise-continuous function in [ a, b ].1 All 
functions that are square-integrable with weight p are denoted by L2(a, b; p). That
1 For advanced students, the positivity condition for the weight function p(x) can be relaxed as p(x)dx 
is a regular Lebesgue measure.

3.2 The Sturm-Liouville theory 65
is,
f b 
L2(a,b; p) = {f(x') : 
f(x')2p(x)dx < ^}.
a
The inner product with the weight p(x) is defined by
<f,g>p = 
f (x)g(x)p(x)dx.
a
In most applications in this book, p(x) = 1on[a, b]. It is easy to verify that 
L2(a, b; p) is a Hilbert space.
Consider the eigenvalue problem: Find a number X and a nontrivial function $ 
such that
L [ § ] = Xp(x)$, 
a<x<b, 
(3.2.2)
subject to the following boundary conditions:
a 1 0(a) + a 2 p(a)0' (a) = 0, 
(3.2.3)
b 1 0(a) + b 2 p(b)0(b) = 0, 
(3.2.4)
where a12 + a22 > 0, b12 + b22 > 0.
In applications, there is another type of boundary conditions where the boundary 
conditions (3.2.3)-(3.2.4) are replaced by the following periodic type:
0(a) = 0(b), 
p(a)0' (a) = p(b)0' (b). 
(3.2.5)
The eigenvalue problem (3.2.2)-(3.2.4) (or (3.2.2) with (3.2.5)) is called regular if 
[a, b] is a bounded interval and p(x) > p0 > 0 on [a, b] for some p0 > 0. Otherwise, 
it is called singular.
Similar to eigenvalue problems in linear algebra, we are interested in only non­
trivial solutions for an eigenvalue problem. We want to emphasize that a boundary 
value problem for an ODE may not have a solution.
Definition 3.2.1. We say X is an eigenvalue of the problem (3.2.2)-(3.2.4) (or (3.2.2), 
(3.2.5)) if the problem (3.2.2)-(3.2.4) (or (3.2.2), (3.2.5)) has a nontrivial solution 
0(x) corresponding to a real number X. The solution 0(x) is called an eigenfunction 
and the number X is called an eigenvalue.
Let
Nx = Span{0(x) e H 1 (a, b): L[0] = X0 associated with (3.2.3)-(3.2.4) or (3.2.5)}.
NX is called the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue X.
From the above definition, we see that any nonzero constant multiple of an eigen­
function is still an eigenfunction corresponding to the same eigenvalue. There are 

66 CHAPTER 3 Eigenvalue problems and eigenfunction expansions
many interesting questions for an eigenvalue problem. For example, how many eigen­
values does an eigenvalue problem have? For each eigenvalue, how many linearly 
independent eigenfunctions are there? Are these eigenfunctions mutually orthogo­
nal? We will answer these questions in the next section.
3.2.2 Some elementary examples
We first consider some simple examples. It will be seen that each function set in 
Example 2.2.1 in Chapter 2 are eigenfunctions for the differential operator dj with 
different types of boundary conditions.
Example 3.2.1. Find all eigenvalues X and the corresponding eigenfunctions $(x) 
for the following eigenvalue problem:
- (p" (x) = k<p, 
0 <x<L, 
(3.2.6)
<p( 0) = 0(L) = 0. 
(3.2.7)
Solution. Since X is unknown, we need to find X and the corresponding eigenfunction 
$(x). We also keep in mind that we are only interested in nontrivial solutions.
We divide X into three possible cases.
Case 1:LetX = 0.
In this case, Eq. (3.2.6) becomes
^"(x) = 0, 
0 < x < L.
The general solution of the ODE is equal to
&(x) = c i x + c 2,
where c1 and c2 are two arbitrary constants.
From the boundary condition (3.2.7), we see that
$( 0) = c 2 = 0, 
$(L) = c 1 L = 0.
Hence, c 1 = c2 = 0. Consequently, $(x) = 0 is the only trivial solution, which im­
plies that X = 0 is not an eigenvalue.
Case 2:LetX< 0.
For convenience we set X =-k2 for some k>0.
From the ODE (3.2.6):
<p" - k2 <p = 0.
The characteristic equation is
r2-k2=0,
which has two real roots r1 = k and r2 =-k.

3.2 The Sturm-Liouville theory 67
The general solution for the ODE of $ is equal to
$(x) = c 1 ekx + c2e-kx, 
0 <x<L,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
From the boundary condition (3.2.7), we see that
c1 + c2 = 0, c1 e + c2 e- = 0.
The linear system has only a trivial solution: c1 = c2 = 0.
It follows that $(x) = 0, 0 < x < L, is the only trivial solution, which is not an 
eigenfunction. This implies that the eigenvalue X cannot be negative.
Case 3: Let X> 0.
We set X = k2 for some k>0. From the ODE (3.2.6), we see that
$"(x) + k2$(x) = 0, 
0 <x<L.
The characteristic equation is
r2 + k2 = 0,
which has two complex roots:
r = ±ki.
The general real solution of the ODE (3.2.6) is equal to
$(x) = c 1 cos (kx) + c 2 sin (kx),
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
From the boundary condition $(0) = 0, we see that
$( 0) = c 1 = 0.
It follows that
$(x) = c 2 sin (kx).
From the boundary condition $(L) = 0, we see that
c2 sin(kL) = 0.
Since we want to find nontrivial solutions, we choose c2 = 0. This implies that
$(x) = sin (kL) = 0,
which yields
kL = nn,
n = 1,2, 3, •••

68 CHAPTER 3 Eigenvalue problems and eigenfunction expansions
Namely, for k = nn we find the nontrivial solution $(x) = sin(nLx). 
Hence, all eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions are
>•=(t) 2-
$n(x) = sin (—)- 
n = 1, 2 3 3 , ••• .
The set of all eigenfunctions for the problem (3.2.6)-(3.2.7) is the set M3 in Chap­
ter 2, which forms a basis for L2(0, L) (see Theorem 3.3.2 in Section 3.3). For any 
function f(x) e L2(0,L), it can be expressed by the Fourier series:
f(x) =
?c 
E 
n=1
cn sin(nL-)-
where
cn
<f-sin (nLx)>
< sin(nLx)- sin(nLx) >
f(x) sin( 
)dx,
V n > 1.
This is the Fourier sine series.
Example 3.2.2. Find all the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions for 
the following eigenvalue problem:
— <fr"(x) = X<fr- 
0 < x < L- 
(3.2.8)
$' (0) = 0 ^' (L) = 0.
(3.2.9)
Solution. By using the same steps, we easily obtain all the eigenvalues Xn and the 
corresponding eigenfunctions are
Xn = (nn- 
^n(x) = cos(nL-)- 
n = 0- 1 - 2- ••• .
We will show that all the eigenfunctions also form a basis for L2(0, L). Note that
X0 = 0 is an eigenvalue in this example, which is different from Example 3.2.1.
For any function f(x) e L2(0, L), we can expand f(x) as a series:
f(x) =
?c
nnx
2_^cn cos ^^r)- 
n=0
where
1 fL
c0 = 
f(x)dx- cn =
L0
< f-cos(nLx) >
< cos(nLx)- cos(nLLx) >
f(x) cos (nnx)dx-
L0 
L
Vn > 1.
This is the Fourier cosine series.

3.2 The Sturm-Liouville theory 69
Example 3.2.3. Find all the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the following eigen­
value problem:
— ^"(x) = X$, 
— L < x < L,
<K—L) = <p(L), $'(—L) = 0'(L).
Solution. We follow the same procedure as in Example 3.2.1 by dividing X into three 
cases.
Case 1:LetX = 0.
From the ODE (3.2.6), we know the general solution is
&(x) = c 1 x + c 2,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
From the boundary conditions, we see c1 = 0. It follows that
^(x) = c 2
is a solution for any constant c2. We simply choose $(x) = 1.
Case 2:LetX<0, say, X =—k2 with k>0.
By following exactly the same method as in Example 3.2.1, we find that $(x) = 0.
This implies that there is no negative eigenvalue.
Case 3:LetX>0, say, X = k2 for some k>0.
The general solution of the ODE is
$(x) = c 1 cos (kx) + c 2 sin (kx).
By using the periodic boundary conditions, we find the eigenvalues
Xn = (nn )2, 
n = 1,2, ••• ,
and the corresponding eigenfunctions are
^n(x) = cos (nLx),
sin(—), 
n = 1, 2, ■■■ .
Note that when n > 1, for each eigenvalue Xn, there are two linearly independent 
eigenfunctions. This is due to the periodic boundary condition.
The set of all eigenfunctions is the set M1 in Example 2.2.1 in Chapter 2. For any 
function f(x) e L2(—L, L),
f(x) = c0 +
?c£[an cos(nLx) + bn sin(nLx)],
n=1

In the next section we will show that the set of all linearly independent eigenfunc­
tions for a regular eigenvalue problem forms a basis for L2 (0, L). The representation 
by a Fourier series is a special case of eigenfunction expansion.
3.3 The main theorem in the Sturm-Liouville theory
In this section we prove the main theorem for the eigenvalue problem in one-space 
dimension.
3.3.1 Self-adjoint operators
Definition 3.3.1. A differential operator L defined by H 2(a, b) associated with the 
boundary conditions (3.2.3)-(3.2.4) (or (3.2.5)) is said to be self-adjoint if for any 
differentiable function f(x') and f(x),
< L[f],f >=< f, L[f] >,
for any f(x), f(x) e H2(a, b),
where f(x), f(x) satisfy the boundary conditions (3.2.3)-(3.2.4) or (3.2.5).
There are many interesting properties for a self-adjoint operator. The general the­
ory for this type of operator requires advanced functional analysis. However, for 
one-space dimension we have a completed theory.
Theorem 3.3.1. The differential operator (3.2.1) associated with boundary condi­
tions (3.2.3)-(3.2.4) (or (3.2.5)) is self-adjoint in any bounded interval [a, b].
Proof. We first assume u, v e C2 [a, b];

dx dx
We only consider the case where a2 = 0, b2 = 0, other cases can be proved similarly.
In this case,
a1 
a1
p(a)u (a) =-----u(a), p(a)v (a) =----- v(a);
a2

p(b)u'(b) =----1 u(b), p(b)v'(b) =----1 v(b).
b2

Thus
p(a) [u(a)v'(a) — v(a)u'(a)] = 0,
p(b) [u(b)v'(b) — v(b)u'(b)] = 0,
which implies
< L[u] ,v>=<u,L[v] >,
Vu,v e C2[a,b].
By applying the approximation theorem, we see that the above equality holds for all 
u(x), v(x) e H 2(a, b). From the definition of a self-adjoint operator, we see that the 
operator L defined by (3.2.1) associated with the boundary conditions (3.2.3)-(3.2.4) 
or (3.2.5) is self-adjoint. 
□
3.3.2 The main theorem
Now, we can state the main result in the Sturm-Liouville theory.
Theorem 3.3.2. For the eigenvalue problem (3.2.2) with boundary condition 
(3.2.3)-(3.2.4) or (3.2.5), the following statements hold:
(a) All eigenvalues are real.
(b) There exists an infinite number of eigenvalues that can be ordered by
X 1 < X2 < • • • < Xn • • • ,
and
lim kn = to.
n ^'X.
(c) For each eigenvalue kn with (3.2.3)-(3.2.4), there exists a unique eigenfunc­
tion fn(x) in the sense of linearly independent functions. For the periodic boundary 
condition (3.2.5), there exist at most two linearly independent eigenfunctions.
(d) Eigenfunctions corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal in 
L2(a, b; p) Moreover, all eigenfunctions {fn(x')}^=1 can be chosen such that the set 
of all linearly independent eigenfunctions forms an orthogonal basis of L2 (a, b; p).

72 CHAPTER 3 Eigenvalue problems and eigenfunction expansions
Namely, every function in L2 (a, b; p) can be expressed by an infinite series
TO
f(x)= y\nX)n(x),

where

Cn — -----T----------------, n — 1, 2, ••• ,

and the series converges to f(x ) in the sense ofa mean-square with weight p(x ).
(e) Every eigenvalue k and the corresponding eigenfunction $(x) satisfy thefol-
lowing identity (called the Rayleigh quotient):
- p0<f' (x)\ba + fb [ pcf'2 + q<f 2] pdx
k — -----------------------------------------------------------
(3.3.2)
fb<P2Pdx
Proof. The conclusion (a) is clear, since all coefficients of L and solution are real.
(b) The proof of this part requires a tedious discussion for all possible cases. We 
give a proof for a special case where p(x) — 1, q(x) — 0 with $(a) — $(b) — 0. Note 
that the eigenvalue problem (3.2.2)-(3.2.4) (or (3.2.5)) is equivalent to the following 
eigenvalue problem:
1 
K [ <fi ]— <fi, 
k
where K — L-1 along with the boundary condition (3.2.3)-(3.2.4) (or (3.2.5)). In the 
advanced PDE (see [5,8]) the operator K is compact from L2 (a, b) into L2 (a, b). 
Therefore we can apply the Fredholm Alternative for the operator K to obtain that 
all eigenvalues are distinct, bounded by ||K || and 0 is only the possible limit point of 
the eigenvalue set {1}. Next, we show that kn ^ to as n ^ to.
Let H01 (a, b) be the Sobolev space defined in Chapter 2. As we indicated before, 
one may use a function sequence in C1[a, b] with zero value near x — a and x — b to 
approximate a function in H01 (a, b). Define a functional J [u] as follows:
J(u) :— b pxx(Uu')2dx 
fb u 2 dx
V Ct
u e H01 (a, b).
Since J(u)is nonnegative, it has a minimum in H01 (a, b), denoted by k1,
k1 — min J (u). 
ueH01 (a,b)
Suppose ^ 1 (x) is the minimum of J(u) in H01 (a, b). 
Define
I(t):— J((f i + tu) > J((f i),
for all u e H01(a, b), t eR1.

3.3 The main theorem in the Sturm-Liouville theory 73
Then, I(t) attains its minimum at t = 0 and I'(0) = 0. It follows for any u e H01 (a, b) 
that
b b 
b b
P p(x)u' $'1 dx = k 11 $ 1 udx.
aa
After performing integration by parts, we find that
/ I— (dx [(p(x)$ 1] + k 1 $ 1 )u
dx = 0,
Vu e H1 (a, b).
Since u(x) is arbitrarily, we see that
L[$1] = k1$1(x), $1(a) = $1(b) = 0.
Let
N1 = span{$(x) e H01 (a, b) : L[$1] = k1$1}.
Recall the inner product in H01(a, b) is given by
<u,v> = [ [u'vz + uv]dx, 
u,v e H01 (a,b).
Since the dimension of N1 is equal to 1 (see (c)), we can decompose H01(a, b) 
into two subspaces
H01 (a,b) = N 1 © N-.
Set
k2 = min J (u). 
u e N—
Again, we use the same argument to obtain k2 and corresponding minimum $2(x). 
We can continue this process to obtain a sequence
{kn, 
n = 1,2, 3, •••}.
Moreover, since N- c H01 (a,b), we see k 1 < k2 < •••. Since the dimension of 
H01 (a, b) is infinite, we see that there exists an infinite number of eigenvalues kn . 
We will show kn ^ <x> as n ^ <x> below.
(c) Suppose there exist two linearly independent eigenfunctions $ and ^ in N 1. 
Then,
L [ $ ] = k$, 
L [ ^ ]= k^.
It follows that
d-[p(x)$x]^(x) - d-[p(x)^x]$(x) = 0.

74 CHAPTER 3 Eigenvalue problems and eigenfunction expansions
Consequently,
p(x) [ fixfi - fifi'x ]= constant, 
0 <x<L.
The boundary condition (3.2.3)-(3.2.4) implies that the constant must be equal to 0. 
Hence,
— (Hxl) = 0, 
0 <x<L.
dx fi(x)
That is, fi(x) and fi(x) are linearly dependent on [0,L].
For the periodic boundary condition (3.2.5), fi(x) and fi(x) may be linearly inde­
pendent. However, for each eigenvalue, there exist at most two linearly independent 
eigenfunctions since a second-order ODE has at most two linearly independent solu­
tion.
(d) 
Suppose n = m, fin(x) e Nn, fim(x) g Nm. We see that
L [ fin ] = ^nfin, 
L [fim ]= ^mfim.
Since L is a self-adjoint operator, we see that
< L[fin],fim >=< fin,L[fim] >,
i.e.,
< ^nfin,fim > = < fin,^mfim > •
It follows that
(^n ^m) < fin,fim > = 0.
Consequently, since kn = km,
< fin,fim >=0,
i.e., fin and fim are orthogonal in L2(a, b).
Let
M = { fin(x): n = 1, 2, •••}.
For every f(x)e L2(a, b), consider the boundary value problem:
L[u] = ^u + f(x), a < x < b,
u(a) = u(b) = 0.
If ^ is not an eigenvalue of the operator L, then the operator L — ^I is invertible. It 
follows that (L — ^I) -1 exists and is compact. By using the Fredholm Alternative, 
we see that M forms a mutual orthogonal basis for L2 (a, b). The same conclusion

3.3 The main theorem in the Sturm-Liouville theory 75
holds for other types of boundary conditions. Next, we prove that {kn} has no upper 
bound. Let f(x') e C2[a, b]. Then,

If we can construct fn(x) such that
L[fn]> nfn,
then we see that km has no upper bound. The construction of fn(x) is easy, since 
p(x) > 0on[a, b]. For example, for p(x) — 1, we can simply choose fn(x) — enx. 
For a general p(x), we set
fn(x) — ena p(s)ds

Corollary 3.3.1. Let M1, M2, M3 be the sets of functions defined in Example 2.2.1. 
Then,
(a) The orthogonal set M1 forms a basis in L2 (-L, L).
(b) Either M2 or M3 forms a basis for L2 (0, L).

Proof. (a) The set M1 consists of all eigenfunctions for eigenvalue problem (3.2.2) 
subject to periodic boundary conditions $(—L) = $(L), $'(—L) = $'(L).
(b) The set M2 consists of all eigenfunctions for the eigenvalue problem (3.2.2) 
subject to $(0) = $(L) = 0. The set M3 consists of all eigenfunctions for the eigen­
value problem (3.2.2) subject to the boundary conditions: $'(0) = $'(L) = 0.

3.4 Eigenvalues problems in several space dimensions
The Sturm-Liouville theory can be extended into higher-space dimension. We only 
state the main results. The reader may find the proof in an advanced PDE book, such 
as [5,8].
Let be a bounded domain in Rn with C2-boundary d&.. Let p(x') > p0 > 0 on 
- _
£2 and p(x),q(x) e L™(Q).
Define an operator
L[u]:= —V[p(x)Vu] + q(x)u,
x e ^.
We consider the eigenvalue problem:
L[u] = kp(x)u, 
x e Q,
(3.4.1)
a(x)p(x)Vvu + b(x)u(x) = 0,
x e d&, 
(3.4.2)
where the weight function p(x) e C(^) and 0 < p(x) < p0 in , v represents the 
outward unit normal on d&. a2 + b2 > 0 on d&.
The boundary condition (3.4.2) contains several interesting cases that will be seen 
in later chapters. When a(x) = 0, we may rewrite (3.4.2) as follows:
p(x)Vvu(x) + c(x)u = 0, 
x e d£2, 
(3.4.3)
where c(x) = bxx).
Proposition 3.4.1. The operator L associated with the boundary condition (3.4.2) is 
self-adjoint
< L[u] ,v >=< u, L[v] >, u,v e H2(Q).
Proof. The proof is based on the following Green’s identity in Proposition 1.5.1: for 
any u, v e H2(Q),
vV(p(x)Vu) — u(V(p(x)Vv) dx = 
p(x)(vVv u — uVvv)ds. 
(3.4.4)
Suppose u(x) and v(x) are solutions of Eqs. (3.4.1)-(3.4.2). For the Dirichlet bound­
ary condition or Neumann boundary condition, we see by Green’s identity (1.5.4) in

3.4 Eigenvalues problems in several space dimensions 77
Chapter 1 that:
< L[u],v > — < u, L[v] > = y p(x)(vVvu — uVvv)ds = 0.
For the Robin type of boundary condition with a(x) = 0, we have
b(x)
p(x) V vu =---— u(x),
a(x)
b(x) 
p(x)Vvv =--------v(x), x e d&.
a(x)
Again, Green’s identity in Proposition 1.5.1 yields
< L[u] ,v >=< u, L[v] >.
□
Similar to the Sturm-Liouville theory, we have the following theorem for the 
eigenvalue problem (3.4.1)-(3.4.2). For convenience, we only consider the first type 
or second type of the boundary condition (3.4.2). For the condition (3.4.3) we need to 
impose an additional sign condition for c(x) (see Chapter 6). Again, the eigenvalue 
problem (3.4.1)-(3.4.2) is equivalent to
1 
K [ f ]= f, 
A
where K := L—1 associated with the boundary condition (3.4.2). The operator K is 
compact from L2 (Q) into L2 (Q). Therefore the Fredholm Alternative for the operator 
K holds. The rigorous proof can be found in an advanced PDE book, such as [8].
Theorem 3.4.1. Let p(x), q(x) e Lto (Q) and p(x) > po > 0 for some po > 0 on £2. 
For the eigenvalue problem (3.4.1 )-(3.4.2), then the following statements hold:
(a) All eigenvalues are real.
(b) There exist an infinite number of eigenvalues that can be ordered
A1 < A 2 < • • • < An • • • ,
and
lim An = to.
n ^'X.
(c) For each eigenvalue An, there exists a set of mutually orthogonal eigenfunc­
tions in NAn and the dimension of the eigenspace NAn is finite.
(d) Eigenfunctions corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal in 
L2(Q; p) Moreover, all eigenfunctions {^n(x')}^=1 form an orthogonal basis of 
L2 (Q; p). Namely, every function in L2 (Q; p) can be expressed by an infinite series
to
f(x) = Z2 Cnfin(x), 
x e&,
n=1

When the space dimension is greater than 1, the dimension of an eigenfunc­
tion space Nk is usually greater than 1. Finding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for 
(3.4.1)-(3.4.2) in higher-space dimension is much more complicated than that in one- 
space dimension. Here we give two examples. The reader will see more examples in 
Chapter 6.
Example 3.4.1. Let R — [0,L] x [0,H]. Consider the eigenvalue problem:
- Am — ku,(x,y) e R, 
(3.4.6)
u(x,y) — 0, (x,y) e dR. 
(3.4.7)
Find all eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions.
Solution. We use the method of separation of variables. Let
u(x,y) — ^(xf\f(y), 
(x,y) e R.
Then, we see that
-[<f"(x)’f(y) + $(xW"(y)] — k^(xff(y), (x, y) e R.
The boundary conditions for ^(x) and ^(y) are
^(0) — ^(L) — 0; ^(0) — ,f(H) — 0.
It follows that
^ " (x) ^ " (y)_
 
 +  
 — — k. 
$(x)-----^(y)
Let
^ ” (x)
-------— — a, 0 < x < L.
^(x)
The boundary condition implies
^( 0) — <f(L) — 0.

3.4 Eigenvalues problems in several space dimensions 79
It follows that the eigenvalues are
Pn = (t) , n = 1,2, ••• .
The corresponding eigenfunctions are
$n(x) = sin (nLx),
n = 1,2,• •• .
On the other hand, from
^"(y) _ 
.
-7-—- = pn - k 
w(y)
subject to the boundary conditions,
^( 0) = ^(H) = 0.
We see the eigenvalues from Example 3.2.1 are
Pn
mnx ^2 J.
^nm
The corresponding eigenfunctions are
^m(y) = sin (my). 
H
Hence, all the eigenvalues are
a = {knm = (— V + (— V ; n,m = 1,2, •••}. 
nm L 
H , 
, ,
The corresponding eigenfunctions are
{^n(x)^m(y) = sinnx) sinmy); 
LH
n, m = 1, 2, •••}.
Example 3.4.2. Let Q = {(x,y,z) : 0 < x < L, 0 <y <H, 0 <z<K}. Find all 
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the following eigenvalue problem in :
— Am = ku, (x, y) e ^,
(3.4.8)
u(x,y,z) = 0,(x,y,z) e dQ. 
(3.4.9)
Solution. We follow the same idea as in Example 3.4.1. Set 
u(x, y, z) = ^(x)/(y)h(z).
Then,
^" (x) + ^" (y) + h" (z) 
^(x) 
^(y) h(z)

80 CHAPTER 3 Eigenvalue problems and eigenfunction expansions
Let
^ " (x)
-------= - a, 
^(x)
^" (y) =- P 
^(y) 
,
h " (z)
= - = Y, 
h(z)
^( 0) = ^(L) = 0;
^( 0) = ^(H) = 0;
h(0) = h(K) = 0.
Then, from Section 3.1, we know that the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigen­
functions for each eigenvalue problem are:
an = (~n')2,
Pm = (mn) 2, 
H
Yk = (kn)2, 
K
fin(x) = sin (nLx);
^m(y) = sin (mny);
H 
hk(z) = sin (k^z). 
K
Therefore the eigenvalues for the problem (3.4.7)-(3.4.8) are
nn ~ mn ~ kn ~
Kmk = (L) 2 + (h) 2 + (K 2,
The corresponding eigenfunctions are
Unmk(x,y,z) = sin(nnx) sin(m^) sin(k^), 
L HK
n,m,k = 1, 2, • • • .
n,m,k = 1, 2, • • • .
We will see more examples in Chapter 6 with different domains.
3.5 Boundary eigenvalue problems
When the space dimension is higher than one, there is a different type of eigenvalue 
problem in which the eigenvalue occurs on the boundary.
Let c Rn be a bounded domain with C2-boundary. Let the operator L be 
defined the same as in Section 3.4 with p(x) > p0 > 0, p(x), q(x) e L“(Q) and 
q(x) > 0 over . Consider the following eigenvalue problem: Find u(x) and p. such 
that
L[u] = 0, 
x e &, 
(3.5.1)
p(x)Vvu + c(x)u(x) = p.u, 
x e dQ, 
(3.5.2)
where c(x) e Lm (dQ) with c(x) > 0 over dQ.
It will be seen that the eigenvalue problem on the boundary is quite different from 
the one in a bounded domain.

3.5 Boundary eigenvalue problems 81
Example 3.5.1. Consider the boundary eigenvalue problem (3.5.1)-(3.5.2) where the 
dimension is equal to 1. Find ^ and ^(x) such that
■ft"(x) = 0, 
0 <x<L,
— ft' (0) = ^ft( 0), 
^' (L) = ^^(L).
(3.5.3)
(3.5.4)
Solution. The general solution of (3.5.3) is equal to
^(x) = c 1 x + c 2,
0 <x<L.
From the boundary condition (3.5.4), we have
c 1 = ^(c i L + c 2 ).
As ^ = 0, we find
*=L,,
^(x) = (x — L).
^ = L and the corresponding eigenfunction
Namely, there exists one eigenvalue 
'^(x) = x — -2.
Example 3.5.2. Let R = {(x, y) : 0 <x <L,0 <y<H} be a rectangle in R2. Find 
all eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions for the following boundary eigen­
value problem:
(x, y) e R,
(x, y) e dR.
(3.5.5)
(3.5.6)
Solution. Suppose
'^(x, y) = v(x)w(y),
(x, y) e R2.
- c 1 = ^c 2,
A^ = 0,
V vty = pty,
Then, Eq. (3.5.5) is equivalent to
v" (x) + w" (y) = 0 
v(x) w(y) .
The boundary condition (3.5.6) is equivalent to
— v'(0) = ^v(0), v'(L) = ^v(L),
— w'(0) = ^w(0), w'(H) = ^w(H).
Set
0 <x <L.
v " (x) _ 
,
v(x) ,
If X = 0, we obtain from Example 3.2.3 that there exists a unique ^ 1 with
2
^ i = L,
L 
v(x) = x — —

82
CHAPTER 3 Eigenvalue problems and eigenfunction expansions
Similarly, for w(y) we obtain
2
^2 = H,
w(y) = y - 2.■
Since ^ 1 = ^2 unless L = H, there is no nontrivial solution for the eigenvalue prob­
lem. On the other hand, when L = H, there exists a nontrivial solution with
*—L,
^(x, y) = (x - L)(y - L)■
We assume k > 0 (the case for k < 0 is the same if we solve the eigenvalue 
problem for w(y)). Then, the general solution for v(x) is equal to
v(x) = c 1 cos(s/kx) + c2 sin(s/kx), 
0 < x < L.
From the boundary condition (3.5.6), we find that
—c 2\[k = ^c 1,
(c 2s[k — ^c 1) cos (VkL) = (^c 2 + c 1VX sin (VkL).
Let y — - c2. Then, we have 
c1
^ — y Vk, 
tan (VkL) — —2—-
y2-1
It follows that for any fixed y>1 there exists a sequence of kn such that 
kn = nn + -J- tan-1 ( 2Y ) ,n = 1, 2 • • • ■
L 1 - y2
Consequently, we obtain
^n — Y ykn,
n = 1,2, ■■■
Once kn is found, we can solve for w(y):
w" (y) — knw(y), 
0 <y<H,
- w'(0) — ^nw(0), 
w'(H) — ^nw(H).
We find that
w(y) — c1 ekny + c2e-kny, 
0 <y<H,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
To satisfy the boundary condition (3.5.6), we need to choose c1 and c2 such that
- (c 1 - c2)'/kn — pkc 1 + c2),
(c 1 ^^nH - c2e-knH) jkkn — ^(c 1 ^^n + c2e-^H).

3.5 Boundary eigenvalue problems 83
If we choose y > 1 such that
(Y + 1) 2 = e 2j^H
Y2 - 1 
e ,
then there exists a nontrivial solution c1 and c2. This implies that we obtain a se­
quence of eigenvalues {fn} that are positive and fn ^ <x> as n ^ <x>.
Theorem 3.5.1. Let p(x),q(x) e Lto(Q) and p(x) > p0 > 0 for some p0 > 0, 
q(x) > 0 on S3. Moreover, c(x) e Lto(9^) with c(x) > 0. For the boundary eigen­
value problem (3.5.1 )-(3.5.2) with n > 2, then the following statements hold:
(a) All eigenvalues are real and nonnegative.
(b) There exists an infinite number of eigenvalues that can be ordered
0 < f 1 < f2 < • • • < fn ■■■ ,
and
lim fn = to. 
n ^to
(c) For each eigenvalue fn, there exists a set of mutually orthogonal eigenfunc­
tions in Nn and the dimension of the eigenspace Nn is finite.
(d) Eigenfunctions corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal in 
L2(9Q). Moreover, all eigenfunctions {fn(x)}n=1 form an orthogonal basis of 
L2 (9Q). Namely, every function in L2 (9^) can be expressed by an infinite series
to 
f(x) = m( Cnfn(x), 
n=1
x e ^,
where
n = 1, 2, ■■■
_ faS! f(x)fnP(x)ds 
f^2<2p P(x)ds ,
and the series converges to f(x) in the sense of a mean-square in L2 (9Q).
(e) Every eigenvalue f and the corresponding eigenfunction f(x) satisfy the fol­
lowing identity (the Rayleigh quotient):
_ k[[plv$I2 + q^2]p(x)dx + /aac(x)^2p(x)ds 
If —
(3.5.7)
Ya.Y> 2 p(x)ds
The proof is very much similar to the case for the eigenvalue problem in . We 
omit it here.

A simple approximation shows that the direct derivative for the sine series of f(x) 
holds if f'(x) e L2(0,L), where the convergence is under the L2(0,L)-norm. It turns 
out that the direct derivative of the eigenfunction series also holds as long as the 
eigenfunction series has certain required regularity. We state a theorem without giv­
ing a rigorous proof (see [23]), since it needs the measure theory and the theory of 
Sobolev spaces.

Theorem 3.6.1 justifies the method by using a series solution in terms of eigen­
functions for a PDE problem. We will see many examples in later chapters.
3.7 Notes and remarks
The classical Sturm-Liouville theory is well understood for students with a basic 
knowledge of the elementary theory of ODEs. This theory reveals many distinguish­
ing features for eigenvalue problems in infinite-dimensional space. It also shows that 
the classical Fourier series is a special case for representing a function in terms of 
eigenfunctions. Students may find that many results for eigenvalue problems in lin­
ear algebra are still valid for the eigenvalue problems associated with self-adjoint 
differential operators.

3.8 Exercises 85
For a general domain in Rn with n> 1 it is difficult to find explicit eigenval­
ues and the corresponding eigenfunctions even for the Laplace operator associated 
with the Dirichlet boundary condition. Nevertheless, one can see that most results in 
the Sturm-Liouville theory hold when the dimension is greater than one. In Chap­
ter 6 we will see the connection between the Fredholm Alternative and solvability 
for an elliptic boundary value problem. For a general elliptic operator that may not 
be self-adjoint, there is a similar theory about the eigenvalue problem. The interested 
reader may find these advanced materials about the general elliptic equations in, for 
example, [8,12,20].

CHAPTER
The heat equation

4.1 The mathematical model of heat conduction
The mathematical model for heat conduction is based on two fundamental laws in 
physics: the energy conservation principle and the experimental Fourier’s law. We 
will demonstrate step by step the process of how we use the basic laws to establish 
the mathematical model for heat conduction in media. The model can be used for 
describing a chemical reaction-diffusion process in which the physical laws are based 
on mass conservation and Fick’s law.
4.1.1 Derivation of the heat equation
We begin with a physical description. Consider an object occupying a domain in 
Rn . Suppose there is a heat generator (heat source) or a cooling system (heat sink) 
running on the inside of the object. Suppose we can make a measurement of the 
temperature at the surface d& and also know the temperature distribution in at an 
initial moment. How can we find the temperature distribution for the object in future 
time?
To answer the above question, we first introduce some physical variables. Let 
u(x, t) be the temperature at location x e and time t > 0. In physics, the heat­
energy density at (x, t) is defined by
E(x,t) := p0c0u(x,t),
where c0 is the specific heat and p0 is the density of the object.
Suppose D is an arbitrary subregion of 
and [11 ,t2] c [0, rc>).
The total heat energy in D at time t = E(x, t)dx.
We also assume that the density of the heat generator (or sink) is equal to f0 (x, t). 
Then, the total heat energy generated in D during a time period [t1, t2] is equal to
f0(x, t)dxdt.

The energy conservation states that

CHAPTER 4
The heat equation
the total energy change over D from t = t1 to t = t2
= -total energy flowing out across the boundary of D in a time period [t1, t2]
+ the total energy generated (or lost) in D over the time period [t1 , t2],
where the negative sign means that the energy is flowing out across dD.
Suppose the heat flux is denoted by <7 (x,t). Then, the total energy flows out across 
the boundary of D in the time period [t1, t2] is equal to
<• vds,
where v is the outward unit normal on dD.
Fourier’s law states that the heat flux is proportional to the gradient of the tempera­
ture:
q(x, t) = — k0Vu(x, t),
where k0 > 0 represents the heat conductivity and the negative sign means the tem­
perature flows from higher to lower values.
From Fourier’s law, we see that the total energy flowing out across the boundary 
dD is equal to

We replace 11 by t and set At = 12 — 11 ^ 0 to obtain

Since D c is arbitrary, we see that u(x, t) satisfies
c0p0ut = k0Au + f0(x,t), 
x e Q,t > 0,
where k0 is assumed to be a constant.

4.1.2 Initial and boundary conditions
From the physical model, we need to know the temperature at the beginning t = o 
(called initial condition) and the information on the boundary d& (called the bound­
ary condition).
Let u0(x) be the initial temperature distribution in :
u(x, 0) = u0(x), 
x e Q. 
(4.1.2)
Again from the physical model, we may have the following types of boundary 
condition.
Case 1: The first type
This condition simply means that the temperature at the surface of the object is 
known, denoted by g(x, t):
u(x,t) = g(x,t), x e dti,t> 0. 
(4.1.3)
This type of boundary condition is also called the Dirichlet type in the literature.
Case 2: The second type
If we know that the heat flows out or flows in across the boundary of , then the 
heat flux is known on the boundary of :
k0Vvu(x,t) = g(x,t), 
x e dti,t> 0, 
(4.1.4)
where v represents the outward unit normal on dQ.
For example, if we know that the surface of the object is insulated, i.e., no heat 
can flow in or out across the boundary, then the heat flux on the boundary is equal to 
zero.
This type of boundary condition is also called the Neumann type.
Case 3: The third type
In addition to the above two types of boundary conditions, some experiments 
show that there is a certain relation between the heat flux and the temperature on the 
boundary. A notable example is Newton’s cooling law that states that the heat flux 
across the boundary is proportional to the difference of the temperature between the 
surface temperature and the surrounding temperature. Hence, we obtain the following 
type of boundary condition:
k0Vvu + a(x, t)u(x, t) = g(x, t),
x e dQ, t > 0,
(4.1.5)

92 CHAPTER 4 The heat equation
where a(x, t) and g(x, t) are known functions.
This type of boundary condition is also called the Robin type. This condition can 
also be considered as the radiation effect for the heat flux (see Remark 4.1.1 below).
Case 4: The mixed type
This boundary condition is simply to give one type of boundary condition on 
one part of the boundary and another type of boundary condition on the rest of the 
boundary.
In the research literature, there are other types of boundary conditions. It is often 
deduced from a concrete physical model and experiments.
We summarize the above discussion to obtain a completed mathematical model 
as follows: Find u(x, t) such that
ut = k2Am + f(x,t), 
x e Q,t> 0, 
(4.1.6)
subject to an initial condition (4.1.2) and one of these boundary conditions, (4.1.3), 
(4.1.4) or (4.1.5). For brevity, sometimes we call the problem an initial-boundary 
value problem or IBVP.
Case 5: The Cauchy problem
When a domain is the whole space Rn , there is no boundary condition needed 
except that there is a certain restriction for the solution as |x | ^ to. We only need an 
initial value. This type of problem is called a Cauchy problem (or called IVP).
When a mathematical model is established, the next task is to justify if the model 
is suitable, which means we need to study the well-posedness of the model. Another 
task is to find the solution. In the next two sections, we will show how to obtain the 
series solution by using the method of separation of variables.
Remark 4.1.1. The classical Fourier’s law does not include the radiation of the heat 
in the conduction process. With the radiation effect, the heat flux is equal to
q(x, t) = — kqVu(x, t) + cu(x, t),
where c is the radiation coefficient.
4.2 Solution of the heat equation in one-space dimension
In this section we will use the results from the Sturm-Liouville theory in Chapter 3 
to find the explicit series solution for the heat equation in one-space dimension.
4.2.1 Homogeneous problems
Let f(x) e L2(0,L) and k >0. Consider the following initial-boundary value prob­
lem in one-space dimension. Let Q = (0,L) x (0, to);
ut=k2uxx, 
(x,t)e Q, 
(4.2.1)

4.2 Solution of the heat equation in one-space dimension 93
a1 ux (0,t) + a2u(0, t) = 0, 
t>0,
b1ux (L, t) + b2u(L, t) = 0, 
t>0,
u(x, 0) = f (x), 
0 <x <L,
(4.2.2)
(4.2.3)
(4.2.4)
where a12 + a22 > 0, b12 + b22 > 0.
The boundary conditions (4.2.2)-(4.2.3) include all cases discussed in Section 4.1 
with different choices of coefficients.
We use the method of separation of variables to find the solution. Suppose
u(x, t) = ^(x)v(t),
0 <x<L,t>0.
Then, Eq. (4.2.1) is equivalent to the following:
v'(t)'^(x) = k2v(t)'^'"(x), 
0 < x < L,t > 0,
which is the same as:
v'(t) ty " (x) 
k2v(t) '^'(x) ,
0 <x <L,t >0.
(4.2.5)
Since the left-hand side of Eq. (4.2.5) is a function of t while the right-hand side is 
a function of x, it must be equal to a constant, denoted by -X, which is unknown.
Here, the negative sign is for convenience.
Now, we have from Eq. (4.2.5) that
v'(t) = — Xk2v(t), 
^"(x) + X'^(x) = 0, 
0 <x<L,t> 0.
Thus,
v(t) = Ce-Xk2t,
where C is an arbitrary constant and X will be determined later.
From the boundary conditions (4.2.2)-(4.2.3), we see that ^(x) is the solution of 
the following problem:
■ft"(x) + Xft(x) = 0, 
0 <x<L, 
(4.2.6)
a i ft' (0) + a 2 ft( 0) = 0, 
(4.2.7)
b i ft' (L) + b 2 ft(L) = 0. 
(4.2.8)
By the Sturm-Liouville Theorem, we see that for the above eigenvalue problem 
there exist eigenvalues
X1 < X 2 < • • • < Xn < • • • , 
with Xn ^ to, and the corresponding eigenfunctions ft 1 (x), ft2(x), • • • ,ftn(x), • ••. 
Once Xn is determined, we have
vn(t) = e-Xnk2t
n = 1,2, 3, •••

94 CHAPTER 4 The heat equation
It is clear that for any n > 1
Un(x, t) = Vn(t)^n(x)
satisfies Eq. (4.2.1) and the boundary conditions (4.2.2)-(4.2.3). By the superposition 
principle, we see that for any constants c 1, ■ ■■ ,cm,
m
u(x,t) 
CnVn(t)^n(x)
n=1
also satisfies the heat equation (4.2.1) and boundary conditions (4.2.2)-(4.2.3).
Naturally, we expect that the above form of series solution holds for m ^ <x>. 
With the help of advanced functional analysis, this step can be proved rigorously (see 
[5]).
Finally, we need to choose coefficients {cn } such that the series solution satisfies 
the initial condition (4.2.4). Since {^n(x)} is an orthogonal basis for L2(0,L), we 
can express f(x) as a series
TO 
f(x) = Z2 an^n(x), 
n=1
0<x<L,
where an are the Fourier coefficients:
< f,^n> 
an =-------------- ,

n = 1, 2, ■■■
Hence, if we choose cn = an for Vn > 1, then
to
u(x, t) = 
anVn(t)^n(x)
n=1
is a solution of the problem (4.2.1)-(4.2.4).
Example 4.2.1. Solve the problem (4.1.1 )-(4.1.4) where the boundary conditions are 
of the Dirichlet type:
ut = k uxx, 
u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0, 
u(x, 0) = f (x),
0 <x <L,t>0, 
t>0, 
0<x<L,
(4.2.9)
(4.2.10)
(4.2.11)
where f(x) e L2 (0,L).
Solution. We follow the same procedure to have the following eigenvalue problem:
ty " (x) = kty,
0 <x <L,

4.2 Solution of the heat equation in one-space dimension

From the previous example in Chapter 3, the eigenvalues and corresponding eigen­
functions are:

Hence, the solution is equal to

There is an interesting phenomenon when one approximates the solution near t = 0 
and near x = 0 and x = L since the solution u(x, t) is discontinuous at the corner 
points (0, 0) and (0, L).
Example 4.2.2. Solve the problem (4.1.1 )-(4.1.4) where the boundary conditions are 
of the Neumann type:
ut = k2uxx, 
0 <x <L,t>0,
ux (0,t) = ux (L, t) = 0, 
t>0,
u(x, 0) = f(x), 
0 <x<L.

The eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions in this case are:

Note that X0 = 0 is an eigenvalue for the corresponding eigenvalue problem, the so­
lution does not decay as t ^ rc>.
The next example is different from the boundary conditions (4.2.2)-(4.2.3). We 
consider a periodic boundary condition. For convenience, we consider the heat equa­
tion in [-L, L].
Example 4.2.3. Solve the problem (4.2.1), (4.2.4) where the boundary conditions 
are of the periodic type:
ut = k2uxx, 
-L<x<L,t>0, 
(4.2.15)
u(-L, t) = u(L, t), ux(-L, t) = ux(L, t), t >0, 
(4.2.16)
u(x,0)=f(x), 
-L<x<L, 
(4.2.17)
where f (x) e L2(0,L).
The eigenvalues are:
Xn = (nn )2, 
n = 0, 1, 2, ••• .
The corresponding eigenfunctions are
^ 0 (x) = 1,
nnx nnx
^n(x) = cos(—), sin(—)
n = 1,2, ■ ■■ .
Note that there are two linearly independent eigenfunctions for each eigenvalue Xn 
when n > 1.
We assume that the initial function f(x) can be expressed as a Fourier series:
f(x) = a0 + 22[an cosnx) + bn sinnx],

where the Fourier coefficients are given by

It is interesting to see that the solution u(x, t) of the problem (4.2.15)-(4.2.17) may 
not decay as t ^ to.
4.2.2 Nonhomogeneous problems
In this subsection we consider the model problem in which there is a heat source in 
the model. Moreover, the boundary conditions may not be homogeneous.
We begin with the nonhomogeneous equation subject to homogeneous boundary 
conditions. Let f (x) e L2(0,L) and g(x, t) e L2(R1 x R +). Consider the following 
problem:
ut = k2uxx + g(x, t),
0 <x<L,t>0,
(4.2.18)
a1ux(0, t) + a2u(0, t) = 0,
t>0,
(4.2.19)
b1ux(L, t) + b2u(L, t) = 0,
t>0,
(4.2.20)
u(x, 0) = f(x),
0 <x <L,
(4.2.21)
where a12 + a22 > 0, b12 + b22 > 0.
The method is based on choosing the same eigenfunctions for the homogeneous 
problem as the basis and then using the superposition property.
Suppose the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions for the homogeneous 
problem are:
{ ^n } ~1, 
{ ^n(x) } ~1.
Since {$n(x)}n=1 forms a basis for L2(0,L), we can expand g(x, t) as a series:
to
g(x, t) = ^nWnW,
n=1
where the Fourier coefficients are
qn(t) = <g,4n>
<$n,$n >
n = 1,2, ■ ■■ .
Assume a solution of (4.2.18)-(4.2.21) is in the following form
to
u(x, t) = 0^an^t)x)n(x).

Since bn(x) is an eigenfunction corresponding to eigenvalue kn, we know that

It follows that Eq. (4.2.18) is equivalent to
TO
TO
5^[a'n (t) + knan(t) ] bn(x) =

n=1
Hence, an(t) must satisfy
a'n (t) + ^nan(t) = qn(t),
t> 0,n = 1, 2, ■ ■■ .
We solve the ODE to obtain
an(t) = an(0)e-Xnt + j qn(s)e-^n(t-s)ds,
t > 0, n = 1, 2, ••• ,
where an(0) is the initial value to be determined.
Finally, from the initial condition (4.2.21), we see that
TO
u(x, 0)
a^an{ 0 )bn(x) = f(x).
n=1
Consequently, if we choose an (0) to be the Fourier coefficient of f(x):
< f,(bn >
an(0) = 11 
, 
Vn > 1,
< bn, bn >
then u(x, t) is the solution of the problem (4.2.18)-(4.2.21).
We summarize the above derivation to obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 4.2.1. Let {kn} £=1 bethe eigenvalues and {bn(x)} TO=i be the corresponding
eigenfunctions for the eigenvalue problem (4.2.6)-(4.2.8). Let
TO
g(x,t) = 52 qn(t)bn(x), 
(x,t) G Q,
n=1
where
<g,bn >
qn(t) = —-— ---- , n = 1,2, ••• .

4.3 Solution of the heat equation in higher-space dimension 99
Then, the solution to the problem (4.2.18)-(4.2.21) is equal to
TO
u(x, t) = a^tn^n x),x

(x,t) e Q,
where

an(0) = ;

< tyn,tyn >
t > 0, n = 1, 2, ••• ,
Next, we consider a nonhomogeneous problem with nonhomogeneous boundary 
conditions. Namely, the boundary conditions (4.2.19)-(4.2.20) are given by the fol­
lowing nonhomogeneous conditions:
a1ux (0, t) + a2u(0, t) = h1(t), 
t > 0,
b1ux (L, t) + b2u(L, t) = h2(t), t > 0.
(4.2.22)
(4.2.23)
To deal with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions, we introduce a new function 
wx, t) such that
a1wx(0,t) + a2w(0, t) = h1(t), 
t > 0, (4.2.24)
b1wx (L, t) + b2w(L, t) = h2(t), t > 0.
(4.2.25)
The direct construction of such a function depends on the coefficients a1, a2 and 
b1 b2.
For example, when a1 = b1 = 0, a2 = b2 = 1, we can easily construct such a 
function:
w(x,t) = L — x h 1 (t) + Lh 2 (t).
After w(x, t) is constructed, we set v(x, t) = u(x, t) - w(x, t). Then, v(x, t) 
will satisfy a nonhomogeneous heat equation subject to homogeneous boundary 
conditions. Consequently, we can follow the same procedure as for the problem 
(4.2.18)-(4.2.21) to find a solution for the nonhomogeneous problem.
4.3 Solution of the heat equation in higher-space dimension
In this section we extend the method in the previous section to a domain in several 
space dimensions. We use the Dirichlet boundary condition as an example.

100 CHAPTER 4 The heat equation
4.3.1 Homogeneous problems and examples
Let £2 be a bounded domain in Rn. A point in Rn is still denoted by x = 
(x 1 ,x2, • • • xn). From the context, the reader should have no confusion when x repre­
sents a single variable or several variables.
Let f(x) e L2(Q). Consider the heat equation in Q = x (0, rc>):
ut = k2Au, 
x e Q,t> 0,
(4.3.1)
u(x,t) = 0, 
x e dti,t> 0, 
(4.3.2)
u(x, 0) = f(x), 
x e Q. 
(4.3.3)
Set
u(x, t) = fi(x)v(t).
Eq. (4.3.1) is equivalent to
v'(t) _ Afi 
k 2 v(t) 
fi
x e ^,
(4.3.4)
where X is an unknown constant. 
It follows that
v(t) = Ce-Xk2t.
For fi(x), we use the boundary condition (4.3.2) to obtain the following eigen­
value problem:
— Afi — Xfi, 
x e ^2,
(4.3.5)
fi(x) — 0, x e dQ.
(4.3.6)
Suppose X is an eigenvalue of the problem (4.3.5)-(4.3.6) and NX is the correspond­
ing eigenspace. Then, by the Fredholm Alternative, the dimension of NX is finite. 
Moreover, we can use the Gram-Schmidt process to find an orthogonal basis for NX. 
We always choose an orthogonal basis ofNX as the set of independent eigenfunctions 
corresponding to X.
Suppose we can find all eigenvalues {Xn}n—1 and also all corresponding eigen­
functions {fim (x)}“= 1, then we can follow the same steps as for one-space dimension 
to find a series solution for the problem (4.3.1)-(4.3.3). Here is just one example to 
illustrate the procedure.
Example 4.3.1. Let D —[0,L]x[0,H] be a rectangular domain in R2. Solve the 
problem (4.3.1)-(4.3.3).
Solution. In this example, we use (x, y) e D instead ofx — (x1, x2).
Note that the eigenvalue problem in D is:
— Afi — Xfi, (x,y) e D, 
(4.3.7)

4.3 Solution of the heat equation in higher-space dimension 101
$(x,y) = 0,

4.3.2 Nonhomogeneous problems
When there is a heat-source generator in the system, Eq. (4.3.1) becomes nonhomo- 
geneous. Also, the temperature on the boundary may not be equal to 0. However, we 
can follow the same idea as for one-space dimension to find the series solution as in 
the case for one-space dimension.
Consider the following nonhomogeneous problem:
Ut = k2&u + g(x,t), 
(x,t) e Q, 
(4.3.9)
u(x,t) = h(x,t), x e dQ,t> 0, 
(4.3.10)
u(x, 0) = f(x), x e Q, 
(4.3.11)
where 
e Rn.
To find the series solution, we first construct a smooth function w(x, t) such that
w(x,t) = h(x,t), x e dQ,t > 0.
There are many different ways to construct such a function. When dQ is smooth, we 
can use the distance function
d(x) = dist{x, dQ}, 
x e ^.
Set
w(x, t) = (1 - d(x))h(x, t).

102 CHAPTER 4 The heat equation
Introduce
v(x, t) = u(x, t) — w(x, t), 
(x, t) e X (0, to).
Then, v(x, t) satisfies a nonhomogeneous equation subject to a homogeneous bound­
ary condition. Next, we follow the same steps as the case for one-space dimension to 
construct a series solution. We skip the details here.
4.4 The well-posedness and energy estimates
In this section we study some theoretical questions for the heat equation. There are 
different ways to establish the well-posedness for the problem (4.3.1)-(4.3.3). Here, 
we introduce a method that can deal with a general parabolic equation (see [8,19,21]).
4.4.1 Definition of a weak solution
Let T > 0 be arbitrary and QT = £2 x (0 ,T ] and ST := d&. x (0 ,T ]. When T = to, 
we use Q = x (0, to).
Consider the general heat equation with a source:
ut+L[u]=g(x,t), 
(x,t)e QT, 
(4.4.1)
B[u](x,t) = 0, 
x e dQ x (0,T], 
(4.4.2)
u(x, 0) = f(x), 
x e Q, 
(4.4.3)
where the operators L and B are defined as before:
L[u] := —V[p(x, t)Vu] + q(x, t)u,
B[u]:= u, 
or 
B[u] := pVvu + 0(x,t)u, 
(x,t) e ST.
The following basic assumptions are assumed throughout this section.
H(4.1) Let p(x,t),q(x,t) e Lto(QT) and p(x, t) > p0 > 0 on Q for some constant 
p0 > 0.
H(4.2) Let g(x, t) e L2(QT) and f(x) e L2(Q). Let 0(x, t) e Lto(ST).
Since we only assume that p(x,t) e Lto(QT), we need to extend our solution in 
a broader class, which we call a weak solution. The regularity theory in advanced 
PDEs shows that the weak solution is also classical if p(x , t) and q(x ,t) are smooth 
(see [8,21]).
Define a space V2(QT) := C([0,T]; H,0 (^)) equipped with the following norm:
IIuIIv2(QT) := max ||u||L2(0) + ||Vu||L2(Q,).
2 T' 
o<t<t 
L (^) 
L (QT)
For the Dirichlet boundary condition we define a weak solution for (4.4.1)-(4.4.3) 
as follows.

4.4 The well-posedness and energy estimates 103
Definition 4.4.1. We call u(x, t) a weak solution of the problem (4.4.1)-(4.4.3) if 
u(x, t) e C([0,T]; H0 (^)) such that the following integral identity holds for all
v e L2([0,T],H01 (Q)) p| H1 (0,T; L2(Q)) with v(x, T) = 0 in Q :
[ y [—uvt + pVu •Vv + quv] dxdt = j f(x)v(x, 0)dx
+ g(x, t)v(x, t)dxdt. 
(4.4.4)
For the Neumann or Robin type of boundary condition, we modify Defini­
tion 4.4.1 as follows:
Definition 4.4.2. We call u(x, t) a weak solution of the problem (4.4.1)-(4.4.3) with
B [ u ] = p V vu + fi(x,t)u = 0
if u(x, t) e C( [0 ,T ]; H1 (^)) such that the following integral identity holds for all 
x e and
v e C([0,T],H1 (Q)) p| H1 (0,T; L2(^)) with v(x, T) = 0 :
[ y [—uvt + pVu •Vv + quv] dxdt + j j fluvdsdt
= f (x)v(x, 0)dx + 
gvdxdt. 
(4.4.5)
One can easily verify that a classical solution must be a weak solution.
4.4.2 The energy estimate and uniqueness
The uniqueness and continuous dependence can be proved by using an elementary 
argument called the energy method. We demonstrate the method in detail here.
Suppose there exist two solutions u1(x, t) and u2(x, t) corresponding to two sets 
of known data (g1(x, t), f1(x)) and (g2(x, t), f2(x)).
Set
g(x,t) = g1(x, t) — g2(x, t), f(x) = f1(x) — f2(x).
Then, u(x, t) = u1(x, t) — u2(x, t) is a solution in the weak sense for the following 
problem:
ut + L[u]= g(x, t), 
x e &,t > 0, 
(4.4.6)
B[u](x,t) = 0, 
x e dQ,t> 0, 
(4.4.7)
u(x, 0) = f(x), 
x e Q. 
(4.4.8)

104 CHAPTER 4 The heat equation
Define the energy function
E(t) = - U u2dx.
We assume that u(x, t) is suitably smooth in QT for simplicity (otherwise, we can 
use the Steklov approximation [21]). The following calculation can be carried out for 
the weak solution without this condition.
Then,
E'(t) = 
uutdx
J Q

-uL[u] + gu dx
JO.
= — j p(x,t)|Vu|2dx — j qu2dx + j ugdx + j up(x,t)(Vvu)ds 
:= I1 + I2 + I3 + I4.
We first consider the case with a Dirichlet or Neumann boundary condition and 
q(x, t) > 0 on Q. In this case, 12 < 0 and 14 = 0.
Next, we use Cauchy-Schwarz’s inequality with a parameter e > 0 to obtain
|I3|=| 
ugdx |
< e y u 2 dx +— g g2 dx
:= J1 + J2.
By using Poincare’s inequality, we obtain
| J11< coj |Vu |2dx, 
t > 0.
If we choose e = 2P°, then we obtain the following energy estimate:
E'(t) + aoE(t) < Ao||g||L2(Q),
where a0 > 0 and A0 are two constants.
We use an integrating factor ea0t to rewrite the above energy inequality in the 
following form:
^d-t (ea0 tE(t) ) < ea0 t || g ||L 2 (Q).
Consequently, we have
E(t) < E(0)e—a0t +A0 t 
e—a0(t—s)g(x,s)2dxds, 
t>0.
0 Q

4.4 The well-posedness and energy estimates 105
When the boundary condition (4.4.2) is Robin type and the sign condition on 
q(x,t) is dropped, then the proof is more complicated, since we have to deal with the 
term involving a boundary integral I4. One needs to use a trace type of estimate in 
order to derive a similar result.
Since q(x, t) e L“(Q), we see that
|12|< CE(t), 
t > 0,
where C is the upper bound of q(x, t) in Q.
For the Robin type of boundary condition (4.4.2), we have
|I4 |<C 
u2ds, 
t > 0,
where C depends only on known data.
Now, we use the trace estimate in Chapter 1 with a small parameter e > 0:
y u2ds < e 
|Vu|2dx + C(e) j u2dx,
where C(e) depends only on .
We choose e sufficiently small to obtain
E'(t) < C1j g2dx + C2E(t), 
t > 0•
We use Gronwall’s inequality to obtain
|| U || L 2 (Q) < C1 eC2 t [|| g IIL 2 (Qt) + 11 f II l 2 W ],
where C1 and C2 depend only on known data.
We summarize the above analysis to obtain the following result.
Theorem 4.4.1. Under the assumptions H(4.1)-H(4.2) the solution of the problem 
(4.4.1)-(4.4.3) is unique and continuously depends on the known data in L2-sense. 
Moreover,
|| U || L 2 (Qt) < C1 ^C2 t [|| g || L 2 (Qt) + || f || L 2 (D) ],
where C 1 and C2 depend only on known data. 
□
The reader will see a different method for the uniqueness proof by using the max­
imum principle for a smooth solution in the next section.
4.4.3 The existence and regularity
There are different ways to establish the global existence of a weak solution to Prob­
lem (4.4.1)-(4.4.3). Here, we use a finite-element method (Galerkin method). The 
idea of the method is based on the fact that an infinite-dimensional function space 
can be approximated by a finite-dimensional space.

106 CHAPTER 4 The heat equation
Theorem 4.4.2. Under the assumptions H(4.1)-(4.2), the problem (4.4.1)-(4.4.3) 
has a unique weak solution u(x , t) and the weak solution is smooth in Q if 
p(x,t),q(x,t) and g(x, t), f(x) are smooth in Q.
Proof. We use the Dirichlet boundary condition as an example to illustrate the basic 
idea of the proof. Choose a basis {fak(x)}k=1 for the space H01 (Q) and orthogonal 
in L2 (Q). For example, we choose all eigenfunctions for the following eigenvalue 
problem:
— Au = Ku, x £ ^2, 
u(x) = 0, 
x £ d&.
Then, we can construct an approximate solution uN (x , t) as follows:
N
uN (x, t) = Yd”(t)fa(x), N = 1, 2, ••• 
k=1
where dkN(t) is the solution of the ODE system:
ddtdN (t) + 
akj(t')dN (t) + dN (t)qk(t) = gN (t),
j=1
dN(0) = <f,fak>, 
k = 1, ••• ,N,
(4.4.9)
(4.4.10)
where
akj(t) = < PV fa, V fa >,
qk(t) = < q, fa >,
gk =<g, fak >.
From the ODE theory, we know that the system (4.4.9)-(4.4.10) has a unique 
solution {dkN (t)} for all N > 1.
From the construction of uN (x , t), we have 
1
d
------ < UN,UN > + < PVUN, VUN > + < qUN,UN > = < gN,UN >, 
2t
UN (x, 0) = fN (x), 
t > 0,
X £ ^,
where
NN
gN (x, t) = 
gk (t)fak(x), 
fN (x) = 
fk fak(x).
k=1 
k=1
Now, from the construction of UN (x, t) we find the following uniform estimate:
sup || UN || L2 (Q) + ||V UN || L2 (QT) < C 
0< t < T
where C depends only on the known constants and an upper bound of T .

4.5 A qualitative property: The maximum principle 107
Moreover, from the construction of uN (x , t), we see that
uN(x,t)t e L2((0,T]; H-1 (Q)).
It follows by Aubin-Lions’ compactness theorem ([28]) that we can extract a sub­
sequence from uN (x, t) that converges to a limit function u(x, t) in V2(QT ). The 
subsequence is still denoted by uN(x, t). Hence,
VuN(x,t) ^Vu(x,t) 
weakly in L2(QT);
uN(x,t) ^ u(x,t) 
strongly in L2(QT).
Finally, we assume that v(x,t) e L2 (0 ,T); H01 (Q)^^H 1 (0 ,T); L2 (^)) is ex­
pressed in the following form:
X 
v(x, t)=vk(t)^k(x), 
k=1
where vk (T) = 0.
From the equation of dkN (t) we have
[-uN vt + pVuN Vv + quN v] dxdt 
0 Q
= 
fNv(x, 0)dx + 
gN vdxdt.
After taking the limit as N ^ x, we see that u(x,t) satisfies the integral equa­
tion. From the integral equation (4.4.4), we see that ut e L2(0,T); H—1 (^)), which 
implies u(x, t) e C( [0 ,T ]; H01 (^)) (see [8,19,21]). Consequently, u(x, t) is a weak 
solution.
Moreover, the regularity theory ([19,21]) implies that the solution is actually in 
C2+a, 1+2 (qt) if the coefficients p(x, t) e C 1+a,a(QT), q(x,t) e Ca,a(QT) and 
the nonhomogeneous term g(x,t) e Ca,a (QT). The reader can find its rigorous proof 
in advanced PDE books, such as [8,19,21]. 
□
Remark 4.4.1. In advanced PDEs, the regularity of a weak solution to a PDE prob­
lem is one of the major research topics.
4.5 A qualitative property: The maximum principle
The maximum principle is the most important property for the heat equation and the 
Laplace equation. It is the fundamental difference between the wave equation and the 
other two types of equations. Physically, it shows that the propagation speed of heat 
is infinite, while the propagation speed of sound is finite. We will see more precise 

108 CHAPTER 4 The heat equation
explanations in later chapters. Throughout this section, a solution for a PDE problem 
always means in the classical sense.
4.5.1 The weak maximum principle
Let Qt = Q x (0,T] for T > 0 and dp Qt := dQ x (0,T] p|{(x, 0): x e Q}.
Theorem 4.5.1. (The weak maximum principle) Suppose u(x , t) satisfies the heat 
equation
ut = k2Au, 
(x,t) e Qt.
Then,
max u(x, t) = max u(x, t), 
min u(x , t) = min 
u(x , t).
(x,t) e Q T 
(x,t) e dpQT 
(x,t) e Q T 
(x,t) e 3pQt
Proof. The idea of the proof is based on a simple fact from calculus: when a function 
attains a maximum (or minimum) value in a region, then the Hessian matrix of the 
function must be nonpositive-definite. However, we must make a modification in 
order to give a rigorous proof.
Let e > 0 be a small constant. Set
v(x, t) = u(x, t) — et.
We see that v(x, t) satisfies
vt = k2Av — e, (x,t) e Qt.
Suppose v(x, t) attains the maximum value at an interior point (x0, t0) e QT. Then, 
we see that
vt |(x0,t0) > 0, 
Av|(x0,t0) < 0,
which is a contradiction with the equation of v(x, t). It follows that the maximum 
of v(x, t) must attain either at the initial time t = 0 or on the lateral boundary of the 
region QT. If we set e ^ 0, we see that u(x, t) has the same conclusion. 
□
Corollary 4.5.1. Suppose g(x,t),h(x,t) e C(QT) and f(x) e C(£2). Let u(x, t) be 
the solution of the following heat equation:
ut = k2Au + g(x,t), 
(x,t) e Qt, 
(4.5.1)
u(x,t) = h(x,t), x e dQ x (0,T], 
(4.5.2)
u(x, 0) = f(x), x e Q. 
(4.5.3)
Then,
||u||0 < C(T) [||g||0 + ||h||0 + ||f ||0], 
(4.5.4) 

4.5 A qualitative property: The maximum principle 109
where C(T) is a constant that depends only on an upper bound of T . In particular, 
the continuous dependence of u(x, t) holds under the maximum norm.
Proof. We only prove the case for the maximum value for u(x, t) in QT .Leta>0 
be a constant to be determined later. We define a new function
v(x,t) = e-atu(x,t), 
(x,t) G Qt.
It is clear that v(x, t) satisfies
vt — k2 Av + av = e - atg(x,t), 
(x,t).
If v(x,t) attains the maximum value M at an interior point (x0, t0) G QT, then at this 
point (x0 ,t0),
vt - k2Avl(x0,t0) ^ 0.
It follows that
aM < e-at0g(xo,to)■
Hence, we obtain the maximum estimate for v(x, t) on Q T. On the other hand, if 
v(x, t) attains its maximum on the lateral boundary of QT or at the initial moment, 
then we have the desired estimate (4.5.4). This concludes the desired estimate for v in 
QT, which immediately implies the maximum estimate for u(x, t) in QT. The case 
for the minimum value of u(x, t) is similar. We combine both cases to conclude the 
proof of the desired estimate (4.5.4). 
□
It is clear that the method in the proof of Corollary 4.5.1 fails if the boundary 
condition (4.5.2) is of the Neumann type. This leads to a different type of maximum 
principle that is often referred as the strong maximum principle. The proof of the 
strong maximum principle relies on the following lemma.
4.5.2 The strong maximum principle
Let be a bounded domain in Rn with dQ. g C2. Let ST = dQ x (0,T].
Lemma 4.5.1. (Hopf’s lemma) Suppose u(x, t) satisfies equation:
ut < k2Au, 
(x,t) g Qt. 
(4.5.5)
If u(x, t) attains its maximum M over QT at a boundary point (x0, t0) G ST and 
u(x, t) <M in a neighborhood of (x0, t0) inside QT. Then,
du ।
dv (x0,t0) > 0,
where v is the outward unit normal at (x0 ,t0).

110 CHAPTER 4
The heat equation
Proof. Since d&. e C2, we choose R and n such that a small paraboloid frustum
A := {(x,t): | x - x *|2 + n 2 (t0 -t) < R 2 ,t 0 - R2 <t <t 0} c Qt, 
n2
with (x 0 ,t0) e 9A 0 ST .Moreover, we choose R sufficiently small such that
u(x, t) < M, (x, t) e A.
Let
B = {(x,t) e A; |x — x*| > —}.
Define
r(x, t) = ^|x - x*|2 + n2(t0 - t), 
(x, t) e A.
Construct an auxiliary function
h(x,t) = e-ar(x,t)2 - e-aR2,
where a > 0 will be determined later.
It is clear that
h(x, t) > 0, V(x, t) e A, 
h(x0,t0) = 0.
Moreover, in B,
ht - k2 Ah
= e-ar2 [n2 - 4a2k2|x - x*|2 + 2ak2]
< e-ar2 [n2 - 2a2k2R2 + 2ak2] < 0,
provided that a is chosen to be sufficiently large.
Now, the parabolic boundary of B consists of S1 and S2, where
S1 = {(x, t): r(x, t) = R,t0 - R2 < t < 10}, 
n2
S2 = {(x, t): r(x, t) = R,t0 - R2 < t < 10}.
2 n2
On S1, h(x, t) > 0 and u(x, t) < u(x0,t0). On S2, since u(x, t) - u(x0,t0) < 0, 
we can choose £ > 0 sufficiently small such that
u(x, t) - u(x 0 ,t 0) + £h(x, t) < 0,
(x,t)e S2.

4.5 A qualitative property: The maximum principle 111
Define
w(x, t) := u(x, t) — u(x0,t0) + eh(x, t), (x, t) e B.
Then,
wt — k2Aw < 0, 
(x, t) e B.
It follows that w(x, t) attains its maximum at (x0, t0). Consequently, we have
V vw | (x 0 ,t0) — 0.
Note that the outward unit normal of BR(x*) at (x0,t0) is equal to
x 0 — x * 
v =-----------.
|x0 — x *|
It follows that
Vvh(x,t)|(x0,t0) <0, 
which implies that
Vvu(x,t)|(x0,t0)> 0. 
□
With the help of Hopf’s lemma, we can prove the following strong maximum 
principle.
Theorem 4.5.2. (The strong maximum principle) Let u(x, t) be a solution of the heat 
equation
ut — k2Au = 0, 
(x,t) e Qt.
If u(x, t) attains a maximum value at an interior point (x*, t*) e QT, then u(x, t) 
must be a constant.
Proof. Indeed, suppose u(x, t) attains the maximum at (x*, t*) e QT and u(x, t) is 
not a constant, then we can construct a small cone C such that
u(x, t) < u(x* , t*), 
(x, t) e C.
Hopf’s lemma in C implies
du— I (x * ,t *) > 0,
a contradiction since we know (x*, t*) e QT and Vu|(x*,t*) = 0.
□

112 CHAPTER 4 The heat equation
4.6 Long-time behaviors of solutions
A challenging question in the study of an evolution PDE or system is to find the 
long-time behavior or the pattern of the solution as time evolves. Many physical 
phenomena such as turbulence and shock waves can be observed from the long-time 
behaviors of the solution for a PDE problem. In this section, we use an elementary 
method to prove some interesting results for the heat equation.
4.6.1 Long-time behavior of a solution for the heat equation
Let Q = f2 x (0, rc>) and S = d£2 x (0, rc>). Consider the heat equation subject to the 
Dirichlet boundary condition:
ut = k2Au, 
(x, t) e Q,
(4.6.1)
u(x, t) = 0, 
(x,t)e S, 
(4.6.2)
u(x, 0) = f(x), x e &, 
(4.6.3)
where f (x) e L2(Q).
Since there is no heat generator or cold sink on the inside of the object, naturally, 
we expect that the temperature will approach the same temperature as that on the 
boundary after a long time. We can actually obtain a more precise result.
Theorem 4.6.1. Let u(x, t) be the solution of the problem (4.6.1 )-(4.6.3). Then,
u(x,t) = O(e A 1 k2t), 
as t ^^,
(4.6.4)
where A1 is the first eigenvalue of the Laplace operator on &..
Proof. Suppose {An}^=1 and {fn(x)}^=1 are the eigenvalues and the corresponding 
orthogonal eigenfunctions for the Laplace operator. We can further choose all fn(x) 
to be uniformly bounded in . Then, we know that the solution of (4.6.1)-(4.6.3) can 
be expressed as a series solution:
u(x, t)
?cE ane - Ank 2 tfn(x), 
n=1
where
~ 
< f,fn>
a — 
,
< fn,fn >
V n > 1.
Since
0 < A1 < A 2 < • • • ,
we see that
?c
u(x, t) = e-A1k2t
E
n=2
ane-(An -A1)k2t fn
a 1 f 1 (x) +

4.6 Long-time behaviors of solutions 113
Since $n (x) are uniformly bounded in and kn - X 1 > X 2 - X 1 for all n = 2, 3, ■ ■■, 
we see that the series is convergent to 0 when t > 10 > 0 for any 10 > 0. This concludes 
the desired estimate for u(x, t) when t h to. 
□
For example, in one-space dimension where = [0,L], we see that
X ■=(L t
It follows that u(x,t) h 0 exponentially with the precise decay rate e-k 1 k2t as 
t h to.
In two-space dimensions where = [0,L] x [0,H],
X 1 = (n)2 + (n")2 .
1 L + H
It follows that u(x,t) h 0 exponentially with the precise decay rate e-k 1 k2t as 
t h to.
We can extend the problem (4.6.1)-(4.6.3) to a more general problem with non- 
homogeneous equation:
ut = k2Au + h(x,t), x e ti,t> 0, 
(4.6.5)
u(x,t) = g(x,t), x e d£2,t> 0, 
(4.6.6)
u(x, 0) = f(x), x e Q. 
(4.6.7)
Let h(x, t) and g(x, t) be in C(Q). Moreover,
lim [||h(x,t) - H(x)||0 + ||g(x,t) - G(x)||0] = 0. 
t HTO
Let U(x) be a solution for the steady-state problem:
- k2AU = H(x), 
x e Q, 
(4.6.8)
U(x) = G(x), x e dQ. 
(4.6.9)
Theorem 4.6.2. Let h(x, t) and g(x, t) be in LTO (Q). Moreover,
tHm [||h(x, t) - H(x)||Lto{Q) + ||g(x, t) - G(x)||Lto{q)] = 0.
Then,
lim ||u(x,t) - U(x)||lto(Q) = 0, 
tHTO
where U(x) is a solution of the corresponding steady-state problem:
- k2AU = H(x), 
x e Q, 
(4.6.10)
U(x) = G(x), x e d&. 
(4.6.11)

114 CHAPTER 4 The heat equation
Proof. First, the maximum principle implies that there exists a constant M such that 
sup |u(x,t)|< M, 
sup |U(x)|< M.
Define
w(x,t) := u(x,t) — U(x), 
(x,t) G Q.
Then, w(x, t) satisfies
wt — k2Aw = h(x,t) — H(x), 
(x,t) G Q, 
(4.6.12)
w(x,t) = g(x,t) — G(x), x g dti,t> 0, 
(4.6.13)
w(x, 0) = f(x) — U(x), 
x g Q. 
(4.6.14)
For any e > 0, there exists T0 > 0 such that
||g(x, t) — G(x)||0 + ||h(x, t) — H(x)||0 <e, 
Vt > T0.
From the series representation of w(x, t) we see that
|w(x, t)| < Ce, 
Vt > T0,
where C is a constant that depends only on M and other known constants.
This concludes the desired limit. 
□
Now, we consider Eqs. (4.6.1) and (4.6.3) subject to a Neumann boundary condi­
tion:
Vvu(x,t) = 0, 
(x,t) g dti x (0, to). 
(4.6.15)
Clearly,
u0 := 
U u(x,t)dx = f f(x)dx.
| | 
| |
It follows that u(x,t) does not decay at t ^ to. However, the next theorem shows a 
more precise behavior as t ^ to.
Theorem 4.6.3. Let u(x, t) be a solution of Eq. (4.6.1) subject to the initial condition 
(4.6.3) and the Neumann boundary condition (4.6.15). Then, u(x , t) — u0 converges 
to 0 in the L2 (Qysense.
Proof. The proof relies on a different version of Poincare’s inequality. Let
v(x, t) = u(x, t) — u0, 
x g Q,t> 0.
Then, v(x, t) satisfies the same heat equation and homogeneous Neumann boundary 
condition (4.6.15). Moreover,
v(x, t)dx = 0,t> 0.

4.6 Long-time behaviors of solutions 115
Let
E(t) = -^ v(x,t)2dx.
Then,
E'(t) + k2 j |Vv |2dx = 0.
Poincare’s inequality (II) implies that there exists a constant c0 such that
y |v|2dx < coj |Vv|2dx.
It follows that
E'(t) + aE(t) < 0, 
t> 0,
where a = —.
c 0
This implies that E(t) converges to 0 exponentially as t ^ m. 
□
4.6.2 Turing instability
From Section 4.6.1 we see that the diffusion in heat conduction stabilizes the temper­
ature distribution. However, this may not be the case for a reaction-diffusion system. 
In this subsection we discuss how the diffusion may cause the instability.
Consider the following 2 x 2 ODE system:
y1 (t) = a 11 y 1 (t) + a 12y2(t), 
t> 0, 
(4.6.16)
y2 (t) = a 21 y 1 (t) + a 22 y 2 (t), 
(4.6.17)
subject to an initial value.
Suppose we add diffusion for each equation with a diffusion coefficient in a 
bounded domain 
e Rn.
u 11 — d 1 Au 1 = a 11 u 1 + a 12 u 2, 
x e Q,t> 0, 
(4.6.18)
u21 - d2Au2 = a21 u 1 + a22u2, 
x e Q,t> 0. 
(4.6.19)
We impose a Dirichlet boundary condition for u1 and u2:
u 1 (x,t) = u2(x, t) = 0, 
x e d&,t> 0.
Suppose we know that the solution of the ODE system is stable as t ^ m, we expect 
that (u1, u2) is also stable as t evolves. It turns out that this may not always be the 
case.

116 CHAPTER 4 The heat equation
We know from the theory of ODEs that the solution of the ODE system 
(4.6.16)-(4.6.17) is stable if the real part of each eigenvalue for the matrix A is neg­
ative, where
A= a11
a21
a12
a22
.
Suppose a 1 and a2 are eigenvalues of the matrix A. Then,
a 1 + a2 = a 11 + a 22 < 0, 
a 1 • a2 = a 11 a 22 - a 12 a 21 > 0.
Let X 1 be the principal eigenvalue for the Laplace operator associated with a 
Dirichlet boundary condition and ty(x) be the corresponding positive eigenfunction. 
Define
y*(t) = J u 1 (x,t)^(x)dx,
y* (t) = 
u2(x,t)'^(x)dx.
Then, we see that y1*(t) and y2*(t) satisfy the following ODE system:
y*(t)' = (a 11 - X1 d 1 )y 1 (t) + a 12y2(t), 
t> 0, 
(4.6.20)
y*(t)' = a21 y 1 (t) + (a22 - X1 a2)y2(t).
(4.6.21)
Let
A* = a11 - X1 d1
a21
a22
a12
- X1 d2
Suppose a1* and a2* are two eigenvalues of the matrix A* . Then,
a1* + a2* = (a11 - X1 d1 ) + (a22 - X2d2) < 0,
a* • a2 = (a 11 a22 — X1 d 1 a22 — X1 d2a 11 + d 1 d2X2) — a 12a21.
Clearly, if we choose d1 sufficiently large and d2 sufficiently small such that
* * n
a1 • a2 < 0,
then a* and a2* have opposite signs, which implies (y(()), y2(t)) is unstable as t ^ 
rc>. Namely, a diffusion added in a system can lead to an instability of the solution to 
a reaction-diffusion system. This is called a Turing phenomenon.
Remark 4.6.1. From the above examples, we see that the first eigenvalue for the 
Laplace operator plays an important role in the study of the long-time behavior of 
the solution for the heat equation and systems. The dynamics for nonlinear systems 
depends on the spectrum analysis for the linearized system (see [2]). In differential 
geometry, a class of important problems is to estimate the bounds of eigenvalues for 
various manifolds.

4.7 The comparison principle 117
4.7 The comparison principle
In this section we prove a comparison principle by using the maximum principle. 
This principle is very useful in deriving an a priori estimate, which is an essential 
step in the study of nonlinear heat equations. We will present an example at the end 
of the section. The interested reader may find many more applications in Monographs 
such as [3,12,24].
Let a(x, t) e C(Q). Moreover, there exists a constant a0 such that
a(x,t) < a0, 
V(x, t) e Q.
Consider the following problem:
ut = k2Au + a(x,t)u + f(x,t), 
(x,t) e Qt, 
(4.7.1)
B [ u ]= g(x,t), 
x e dQ x (0 ,T ], 
(4.7.2)
u(x, 0) = h(x), 
x e ti, 
(4.7.3)
where
B[u]:= u, 
or 
B[u] := Vvu.
Suppose the data set (f (x, t), g(x, t), h(x)) are continuous and the problem 
(4.7.1)-(4.7.3) has a unique classical solution u(x, t).
Theorem 4.7 .1. (The comparison principle) Let ui (x, t) be the solution of the 
problem (4.7.1)-(4.7.3) corresponding to the data set (fi(x,t), gi(x,t),hi(x')) for 
i = 1, 2.If
f1 (x,t) > f2(x,t),g 1 (x,t) > g2(x,t),h 1 (x) > h2(x), V(x,t) e Q,
then
u1 (x , t ) > u2 (x , t ), V(x , t ) e Q.
Proof. We prove the theorem by dividing different cases. Set
u(x, t) = u1(x, t) - u2(x, t), 
(x, t) e Q.
Case (a): The Dirichlet boundary condition B[u] = u(x, t) = g(x, t).
Then, u(x, t) satisfies
ut = k2Au + a(x,t)u + f(x,t), 
(x,t) e Qt, 
(4.7.4)
u(x,t) = g(x,t) > 0, x e dQ x (0,T], 
(4.7.5)
u(x, 0) = h(x) > 0, x e Q, 
(4.7.6)
where
f(x,t):= f1(x, t) - f2(x, t) > 0, 

118 CHAPTER 4 The heat equation
g(x, t) := g1(x,t) - g2(x,t), 
h(x) := h1(x) - h2(x).
The maximum principle implies that
u(x, t) > 0, 
(x, t) G Q.
Case (b): The Neumann boundary condition B[u] = Vvu(x, t) = g(x, t).
Then, u(x, t) satisfies
ut = k2Au + a(x,t)u + f(x,t), 
(x,t) G QT, 
(4.7.7)
Vvu(x,t) = g(x,t) > 0, x g dQ x (0,T], 
(4.7.8)
u(x, 0) = h(x) > 0, 
x g Q. 
(4.7.9)
By Hopf’s Lemma 4.5.1, u(x, t) cannot attain a minimum on the lateral boundary 
dQ x (0,T]. The strong maximum principle implies that u(x, t) cannot attain a neg­
ative minimum at an interior point of Q unless it is a constant. It follows that
u(x, t) > 0, 
(x, t) g Q. 
□
The comparison principle is also valid if the boundary condition is of the Robin 
type:
Vvu = b(x,t)u + g(x,t), 
(x,t) g ST. 
(4.7.10)
Theorem 4.7 .2. Suppose b(x,t) g C(ST). Let u(x,t) g C(Q^|C2,1 (QT) be the 
solution of Eq. (4.7.1), (4.7.2) associated with the Robin condition (4.7.10). If 
f (x, t), g(x, t), and h(x) are nonnegative in their domain, then
u(x, t) > 0, V(x, t) g Q.
Proof. Let e > 0 and set he(x) := h(x) + e. For brevity, we still use u(x, t) as the so­
lution of (4.7.1), (4.7.3), (4.7.10) with initial value he(x). By the continuity principle, 
we know that there exists a small T0 > 0 such that the solution of (4.7.1), (4.7.3), and 
(4.7.10) must be positive in QT0. Suppose the nonnegativity of u(x, t) in Q fails. Let 
T* be the first time in which u(x, t) attains 0, say at (x0,T*). By the strong maximum 
principle, (x 0 ,T *) cannot be an interior point of Q .On the other hand, Hopf’s lemma 
implies that the minimum point (x0, T *) cannot be located on the lateral boundary 
dQ x (0, rc>) since g(x, t) > 0 on dQ x (0, ^), a contradiction. Therefore we obtain
ue(x, t) > 0, 
(x,t)G Q.
After taking a limit as e ^ 0, we obtain the desired result. 
□
As an application, we investigate a semilinear heat equation. This type of equa­
tions is motivated by various models arising from biological sciences and chemi­
cal engineering. For example, in population dynamics, the population concentration 

4.7 The comparison principle 119
u(x , t) satisfies a logistic growth model with growth rate r and the maximum capac­
ity K. Then, u(x , t) satisfies
ut — dku = ru( 1----- ).
K
Example 4.7.1. Let f(s) e C1 [0, rc>) with f(0) = f(K) = 0. Consider the follow­
ing semilinear problem:
ut — dku = f(u),
Vvu(x, t) = 0, 
u(x, 0) = u0(x),
(x,t)eQ,
(x,t) e dQ x (0, <x>), 
x e ^,
where d>0 is the diffusion coefficient and the initial value u0 (x) satisfies
0 < u0(x) < K.
The goal is to prove that the above problem has a unique solution. The uniqueness 
question is obvious by applying the maximum principle. Moreover, any solution to 
the above problem must satisfy the following a priori estimate:
0 < u(x,t) < K, (x,t) e Q.
To prove the existence we construct two sequences called lower and upper solu­
tion sequences (see [24]). The limit of each sequence is the solution of the problem.
Set u0(x, t) = 0 on Q. We define a sequence un(x, t) as follows: for each n > 0 
we solve the following linear equation un +1
u(n+1 )t - dkun +1 = f(un), 
(x,t) e Q,
Vvun+1 (x,t) = 0, 
(x,t) e dti x (0, <x),
un+1 (x, 0) = uo(x), 
x e Q.
Let {un+1 (x, t )} be the solution sequence. Then, the comparison principle yields that
0 < u0 < u 1 <••• < un(x, t) < un+1 < ••• < K, (x,t) e Q.
Similarly, we set it0(x, t) = K and define un(x, t) to be the solution of the fol­
lowing linear problem:
u(n+1 )t — dMn +1 = f(hn), 
(x,t) e Q,
Vvun+1 (x,t) = 0, 
(x,t) e dQ x (0, ^),
un+1 (x, 0) = uo(x), 
x e ^.
Again, the comparison principle yields
0 < it n +1 < i< n <••• < ut o (x, t) < K,
(x,t) e Q.

120 CHAPTER 4 The heat equation
Moreover, the energy estimate implies that for any T>0,
OmaT II un IIL2 (Q) + ||V un H l 2 (QT) < C;
OmaxT II u n || L2 W + I|V u n || L2 (QT) < C;
where C depends only on known data, but not on n.
Since each of the above function sequences is monotone, there exists a limit, 
denoted by u(x, t ) and
max ||u||l2(q) + ||Vu||l2q < C. 
0<t<T 
L (^) 
L QT
Moreover, if u0(x) e Ca(Q), then the regularity theory yields u(x, t) e Ca,a (Q)T) Q 
C2+a, 1+2 (QT). Since the solution of the problem is unique, we see that
u(x,t) = lim un(x,t) = lim itn(x,t), 
n ^to n 
n ^to
which is a solution of the original semilinear problem.
4.8 Notes and remarks
In this chapter we studied the solution for the heat equation. The mathematical model 
of heat conduction is derived in detail as a first step. Our emphasis is on the physical 
meaning of each parameter in the heat-conduction model. This will give students 
the basic method of how to extend a simple model to more complicated problems. 
Section 4.2 and Section 4.3 are elementary. Students should not have any difficulty 
to learn this part of the materials. However, one must note that the series solution for 
the heat equation is formal. The smoothness of the series solution is very difficult to 
prove when the space dimension is higher than one. Section 4.4 is more theoretical 
and beginners may skip this section. The method can be used in dealing with a general 
parabolic equation. The asymptotic behavior of the solution is included in this chapter 
to show students why the sign of the eigenvalue is important. The Turing phenomenon 
shows that the system of reaction-diffusion equations has a much more complicated 
dynamics than that of the corresponding ODE system.
The maximum principle is the most important property for the heat equation. 
In addition to its own intrinsic interest, it is also a powerful tool in dealing with 
nonlinear problems. One will find many more applications in research fields (see 
[3,7,10,14,19,24]).

5.1 The mathematical model of a vibrating string
In this section we derive the mathematical model for the motion of a vibrating string. 
The model derivation is based on the classical Newton’s second law.
5.1.1 The mathematical model of a string vibration
Consider an elastic string with length L attached on two fixed pegs. Suppose a small 
force is acting on the string vertically, which causes the string to vibrate in the vertical 
direction, see Fig. 5.1 below. The task is to find the position of the string at any time 
if one knows the initial position and initial velocity of the string.
FIGURE 5. 
1
To derive the mathematical model, we suppose that the string lies between [0, L] 
on the x-axis. Let p be the mass density of the string and f be the external force per 
unit length acting on the string in the vertical direction.
Let u(x, t) be the displacement of the string from the x-axis at position x and time 
t > 0.
The physical foundation of the model is based on the classical Newton’s second 
law:
F = ma.

126 CHAPTER 5 The wave equation
Consider a small segment of the string, say [x, x + Ax] with Ax > 0. Then, the total 
mass for the string segment [x, x + Ax] ^ p(x)Ax.
First, we know the velocity and the acceleration of the string at x e [0,L] verti­
cally are, respectively, equal to
du(x,t) 
d 2 u(x,t)
v =--------- , a =------.— ■
dt , 
dt2
Now, we analyze the total force acting on the string. There are three types of force 
acting on the string segment [x,x + Ax]:
(1) External force density, denoted by f0 (x, t), in the vertical direction.
(2) Tensile force, denoted by T, at each end of the string segment [x, x + Ax].
(3) Resistance force (damping force), which is assumed to be proportional to the 
velocity.
Assume that a(x, t) is the angle between the x-axis and the tangent line of the 
string at x, see Fig. 5.2. Since the tensile force acting on the string is in the tangential 
direction of the string, in the vertical direction the tensile forces at x and x + Ax, 
respectively, are equal to
n
T(x, t) • j = |T(x, t)|cos(T(x, t), j) = |T(x, t)|cos(- + a(x, t))
= -|T(x, t)|sin(a(x, t));
T(x + Ax,t) • j = |T(x + Ax, t) |cos(T(x + Ax, t), j)
= |T(x + Ax, t)|cos^— — a(x + Ax, t))
= |T(x + Ax, t)|sin(a(x + Ax, t)),
where j represents the unit vector in the u-direction.
FIGURE 5.

5.1 The mathematical model of a vibrating string 127
Since the vibration of the string is small, we may approximate sin(a(x, t)) and 
sin(a(x + Ax, t)) by the tangent:
sin(a(x + Ax, t)) ^ tan(a(x + Ax, t)), 
sin(a(x, t)) ^ tan(a(x, t)).
On the other hand,
tan(a(x + Ax, t)) = ux(x + Ax, t), tan(a(x, t)) = ux(x, t).
Let T(x,t)=|T(x, t)| be the magnitude of the tensile force. Then, the total tensile 
force in the u-direction is approximately equal to
T(x + Ax, t)ux(x + Ax, t) — T(x, t)ux(x, t).
The total external and resistance forces acting on the string segment [x, x + Ax] is 
approximately equal to
— Y0 (x+&xutdx + f++Ax f0(x,t)dx, 
xx
where Y0 represents the coefficient of the resistance force.
We now apply Newton’s law on the string segment [x, x + Ax] to obtain
p0(x)utt(x, f)Ax ^ T(x + Ax, t)ux(x + Ax, t)) — T(x, t)ux(x, t)
— Y0ut(x, t)kx + (Ax)f0(x, t).
After dividing by Ax in the above equation and taking the limit as Ax ^ 0, we 
see that
d
P0(x)utt(x, t) + y0ut = — [T(x, t)ux(x, t)] + f0(x,t).
dx
In particular, when the mass density and the magnitude of the tensile force are 
assumed to be constants, denoted by p0 and T0, respectively, we obtain the following 
wave equation with one space dimension:
utt + Yut = c2uxx +f(x,t), 
0 <x<L,t>0, 
(5.1.1)
where
c = /T0 ,Y = Y0 ,f(x.,) = f0^.
p0 
p0 
p0
If there is no resistance or external force, then u(x, t) satisfies the following ho­
mogeneous wave equation in one-space dimension:
utt = c2uxx,
0 <x<L,t>0.
(5.1.2)

128 CHAPTER 5 The wave equation
5.1.2 Initial and boundary conditions
To determine the position of the string in future time, one must specify an initial 
position and initial velocity. Moreover, one needs to know how the string is tied at 
each end. These are necessary initial and boundary conditions for a complete model 
of the vibrating string.
At the initial moment t = 0, the initial position and initial velocity must be speci­
fied in order to determine the motion of the string in the future. We assume:
u(x, 0) = g 1 (x), 
0 < x < L, 
(5.1.3)
ut(x, 0) = g2(x), 
0 < x < L, 
(5.1.4)
where g1 (x) and g2 (x) are given functions.
It is also necessary to specify how the two ends of the string are set up. Namely, 
we need to specify the conditions at the two ends of the string. It turns out that we 
can classify the boundary conditions similarly to the cases for the heat equation with 
different physical meaning.
(a) The first type (Dirichlet type)
This type of boundary condition is to specify the displacement of the string at 
x = 0 and x = L at any time t > 0:
u(0,t) = h 1 (t), 
t > 0, 
(5.1.5)
u(L, t) = h2(t), 
t >0, 
(5.1.6)
where h1 (t ) and h2 (t) are given functions.
In particular, for fixed pegs at the two ends of the string, h1 (t) = h2 (t) = 0 for all 
t >0.
(b) The second type (Neumann type)
This type of boundary condition is to specify the tensile force at x = 0 and x = L 
at any time t > 0:
- T0ux(0,t) = h1(t), 
t>0, 
(5.1.7)
T0ux(L,t) = h2(t), 
t>0, 
(5.1.8)
where h1 (t ) and h2 (t) are given force functions.
For example, if the string is set to be free at one end x = L, then
T0ux(L, t) = h2(t) = 0,t> 0.
(c) The third type (Robin type)
This type of boundary condition is to specify relations between the tensile force 
and the displacement of the string at x = 0 and x = L at any time t > 0.
- T0ux(0,t) + au(0,t) = h1(t), t >0, 
(5.1.9)
T0ux(L, t) + bu(L, t) = h2(t), 
t>0, 
(5.1.10) 

5.2 Solutions of the wave equation in one-space dimension 129
where a, b are constants and h1 (t) and h2 (t) are given functions.
A typical example of the third type of boundary condition is when the string is tied 
with a spring, then Hooke’s law shows the force is proportional to the displacement 
of the string.
(d) Other types of boundary conditions
There are several other types of boundary conditions from different physical mod­
els. One of these in the research literature is called a dynamical boundary condition. 
We give one example here.
Consider a string is attached to a dynamical system such as a spring-mass system. 
The position of the string at time t, u(0,t) = y(t) is unknown but can be determined 
by Newton’s law and Hooke’s law:
m d 2 y(t) 
dt 2
= -k(y (t) - y0 ) + other forces,
where k is the spring constant and y0 is known to be the still position of the spring. 
The other forces could be a resistance force, say yut , or an external force, say g(t).
Then, the boundary condition at x = 0 becomes
mutt (0,t) = -k(u(0,t) - y0) + yut(0,t)+g(t), 
(5.1.11)
where y0 is the initial position of the string, and g(t) represents the known external 
force acting on the object in the vertical direction.
We summarize the above discussion to obtain a completed mathematical model 
consisting of Eq. (5.1.1) or Eq. (5.1.2) subject to initial conditions (5.1.3)-(5.1.4) 
and one type of boundary conditions such as (5.1.5)-(5.1.6). It will be seen that the 
constant c in Eq. (5.1.1) represents the speed of the string movement.
5.2 Solutions of the wave equation in one-space dimension
In this section we find a series solution for the wave equation in one space dimension. 
We use the first type of boundary condition as an example.
5.2.1 Series solution of the wave equation
Consider the wave equation subject to the first type of homogeneous boundary con­
ditions:
utt - c2uxx = f(x,t), 
0 <x<L,t>0, 
(5.2.1)
u( 0 ,t) = u(L,t) = 0, t > 0, 
(5.2.2)
u(x, 0) = gi(x),ut(x, 0) = g2(x), 
0 < x < L. 
(5.2.3)

130 CHAPTER 5 The wave equation
The basic strategy is similar to the case for the heat equation. We will solve the prob­
lem by using the method of separation of variables. As a first step, we first decompose 
the problem (5.2.1 )-(5.2.3) into two problems:
P(a) Homogeneous equation with nonhomogeneous initial conditions.
u1tt - c2u1xx =0, 
0 <x<L,t>0, 
(5.2.4)
u 1 (0,t) = u 1 (L,t) = 0, 
t > 0, 
(5.2.5)
u 1 (x, 0) = g 1 (x), 
u 1 t(x, 0) = g2(x), 
0 < x < L. (5.2.6)
P(b) Nonhomogeneous equation with homogeneous initial conditions.
2 
u2tt -c u2xx = f(x,t), 
u2(0,t) = u2(L, t) = 0, 
u2(x, 0) = u2t (x, 0) = 0,
0 <x <L,t >0, 
t>0,
0<x <L.
(5.2.7)
(5.2.8)
(5.2.9)
It is clear that the solution of (5.2.1)-(5.2.3) is u(x, t) = u 1 (x, t) + u2(x, t).
Theorem 5.2.1. Let g 1 (x),g2(x) e C2(0,L)f}L2(0,L). Then, the solution to the 
problem (5.2.4)-(5.2.6) is given by the following series:
u1 (x, t) = 
[accos^ + bksin^^Lc-^sin^Lx),
k=1
(5.2.10)
where ak and bk are derived from the Fourier coefficients ofg1 (x) and g2 (x).

bk =

Proof. To find the solution u1(x, t), we use the method of separation of variables. 
Let u 1 (x, t) = ^(x)h(t). From Eq. (5.2.4), we have
h"(t) _ ^"(x) 
c2h(t) $(x) '
which must be equal to a constant, say -X.
Moreover, from the boundary conditions (5.2.5) we see that
^( 0) = ^(L) = 0.
For the eigenvalue problem:
^ " = W,
0 <x <L,

All eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions are given by
Xn = (nn)2, 
^n(x) = sin(~Lx),n = 1, 2, •’’ •
For X = Xn, the general solution for
h"(t) + c2Xnh(t) = 0, 
t> 0,
is equal to
hn(t) = an cos(nL—) + bn sin(nL-), 
where an and bn are arbitrary constants.
Now, we use the superposition principle to set

Corollary 5.2.1. (Generalized D’Alambert formula) Suppose that g 1 (x) and g2(x) 
are in C2 (0, L) L2 (0, L). Moreover, g1 and g2 are odd extended into (-L, 0). 
Then, the solution of the problem P(a) can be explicitly expressed by the following 
formula:
u(x,t) = 1 [g1 (x + ct) + g1 (x - ct)] + 
g2(y)dy,

where g1 (x) and g2(x) are the odd extensions of g 1 (x) and g2(x) into (-L, 0) with 
2L-period in R1.

5.2 Solutions of the wave equation in one-space dimension 133
From the representation of the solution in Corollary 5.2.1, we see the structure of 
the solution in the strip [0,L] x [0, o), see Fig. 5.3 below.

while an(t) is chosen to satisfy the wave equation (5.2.7) and the initial conditions: 
an(t) + X2c2an(t) = an(t), 
t> 0,
an(0) = a'n(0) = 0, 
n = 1,2, • • • ,n.
Hence a series solution for Problem (b) can be obtained. Here we use a different 
approach. The new method will enable us to derive a compact form of the solution.
Lemma 5.2.1. Assume f(x,t) e C2(QT)QL2(QT) for any T > 0. Let w(x,t — t) 
be a solution of the following problem for any t e [0 ,t ]:
wtt — c2 wxx = 0, 
0 <x<L,t >t,

134 CHAPTER 5 The wave equation
w(0,t — t) = w(L, t — t) = 0, 
t > t,
w(x, 0) = 0, 
t > T,
Wt(x, 0) = f(x,T), 
0 < x < L,
where 0 < t < t. Then,
u(x, t) = w(x, t — t)dt 
(5.2.12)
0
is the solution of the problem (5.2.7)-(5.2.9).
Proof.
f t
ut(x, t) = 
wt(x, t — t)dt + w(x, t — t)|t=t
J0
= 
wt(x, t; t)dt,
0
where the first initial condition w(x, t — t)= 0att = t is used.
utt(x, t) = wt (x, 0) + 
wtt (x, t — t)dt
= f(x, t) + 
wtt (x, t — t)dt,
where the second initial condition wt(x, t — t)= f(x,t)at t = t is used.
It follows that
utt — c2uxx = f(x,t)+ 
[wtt — c2wxx]dt = f(x,t),0 <x <L,t >0,
u(0,t) = u(L, t) = 0,t> 0,
u(x, 0) = ut(x, 0) = 0, 
0 < x<L,
i .e., u(x, t) defined as Eq. (5.2.12) is a solution of the problem (5.2.7)-(5.2.9). □
Corollary 5.2.2. (Solution representation) Let g 1 (x), g2(x) e C2(0,L^| L2(0,L) 
and f(x, t) e C2(Q^| L2(QT) for any T > 0. Then, the solution of(5.2.1)-(5.2.3) 
can be expressed by:
u(x,t) = 1 [g1 (x + ct) + g1 (x — ct)] +

(5.2.13)
where g1 (x) and g;2(x) are defined the same as in Corollary 5.2.1. 
□

5.2 Solutions of the wave equation in one-space dimension 135
Remark 5.2.1. From the mathematical point of view, we can find the formal series 
solution for g 1 (x), g2(x) e L2(0,L) and f(x, t) e L2(QT). However, from the so­
lution representation (5.2.13) u(x, t) has the same smoothness as g1(x), g2(x) and 
f (x, t) for (x, t) e (0,L) x (0, rc>). This is very different from the solution of the 
heat equation.
Remark 5.2.2. For nonhomogeneous boundary conditions such as
u(0,t) = h 1 (t), u(L,t) = h2(t), 
t > 0,
set
w(x, t) = u(x, t) - [h 1 (t) + x(h2(t) - h 1 (t))].
Then, w(x, t) will satisfy the following nonhomogeneous wave equation:
wtt — c2 wxx = f(x,t) —[ h 1(t) + L(h 2(t) — h 1(t) ] 
subject to homogeneous boundary conditions and new initial conditions
w(x, 0) = g 1 (x) — [h 1 (0) + x(h2(0) — h 1 (0))], 
wt(x, 0) = g2(x) — [h 1 (0) + x(h2(0) — h 1 (0))].
Thus the solution can be found as before.
Remark 5.2.3. For the second or third type of boundary conditions
ux(0,t) — au(0,t) = h 1 (t), t > 0;
ux(L, t) + fiu(L, t) = h2(t), t > 0.
One can find a series solution by using the same argument as those problems in 
Chapter 4 for the heat equation.
5.2.2 Natural frequency and resonance phenomenon
From the series solution of Problem (a), we define
Nk =J ak + bk

ak = arctan(—).

(5.2.14)
The above series solution can be considered as a superposition of each harmonic 
wave
Wn(x, -) = Nnsin(cL- + an) sin(nLx).

It is clear that Nn is the maximum magnitude of oscillation for each wave and the 
period is equal to
2L
Pn = —

wn = — = — is called the natural frequency.

It is clear that w 1 = 2L is the smallest frequency, often called the fundamental fre­
quency. Also, the other higher frequencies are called overtones, which harmonize the 
sound.
Recall that

It follows that wn is increasing if the tensile force T0 is increasing or the mass density 
p0 is decreasing.
This phenomenon is well experienced in playing musical instrument such as the 
violin or cello.
Suppose that at an initial moment, a string is in a still position, which implies 
g1 (x) = g2(x) = 0on[0,L]. Suppose there is an external force

5.3 Wave propagation in several space dimensions 137
Then, an(t) must satisfy
an (t) + m2 (n)an(t) = bn(t), 
n = 1,2, ••• ,t > 0, 
(5.2.17)
an( 0) = a’n (0) = 0, 
(5.2.18)
where
nnc
m 0 (n) ^^, 
n = 1,2, ••• .
Note that the general solution of the homogeneous equation for an(t) is equal to
an(t) = c 1 cos(m0(n)t) + c2 sin(m0(n)t),
where c1 and c2 are constants.
If there exists a number n = n0 such that
bn0 (t) = A sin(m0(n0)t), or,B cos(m0(n0)t),
where A>0, B>0, then, from the ODE theory, the solution an(t) to the problem 
(5.2.17)-(5.2.18) will become unbounded:
I an0 (t) | —— ^c, as t —— ^o,
which implies
Iu2(x,t)I — rc>, 
as t — rc>.
This is called the resonance phenomenon. The physical interpretation is that the sys­
tem will break down if there is a periodic force with a period that is close to that of 
w0 (n) for any n > 1, even if the magnitude of the force is very small.
5.3 Wave propagation in several space dimensions
Like a vibrating string, there are many other physical phenomena that can be modeled 
by the wave equation. Here we briefly describe the mathematical models for a thin 
membrane vibration in two-space dimensions and a sound propagation in three-space 
dimensions.
5.3.1 The mathematical model of a vibrating membrane
Suppose a thin membrane occupies a domain c R2 and the edge of the membrane 
is attached to the boundary of . If there is a small external force density, denoted by 
f0 = f0(x, y, t), in the vertical direction acting on the membrane, then it will vibrate. 
The goal is to find the position of the membrane at anytimet>0 ifan initial position 
and an initial velocity are known.
Let z = u(x, y,t) be the displacement of the membrane in the z-direction.

138 CHAPTER 5 The wave equation
Consider a small piece S of the thin membrane and D represents the projection of 
S in the xy -plane. The tensile force on the edge of the small piece of the membrane 
in the tangential direction is
Ft = T(v x n),
where T is the magnitude of the tensile force, v is the tangential direction of the 
boundary curve of the small surface S and n is the unit normal of S on the boundary 
curve dS, see Fig. 5.4.
FIGURE 5.4
The component of the tensile force in the z-direction, which is the same as the 
motion of the membrane, equals
FT • k = T(v x n) • k,
where k is the unit vector of the z-axis.
Therefore the total tensile force acting on the surface S in the z-direction is
I T(v x n) • kds.
S
On the other hand, the total mass of S equals
p(x, y)dA,
D
where p(x, y) is the density of the membrane and D is the projection of S on the 
xy-plane.
Newton’s second law implies that
Pd pdA^ utt ^ y T(v x n) • kds + f f f0(x,y,t)dA

5.3 Wave propagation in several space dimensions 139
= j T(n x k) • vds + j f f0(x,y,t)dA,
where the vector identity 
(A x B) • C = (B x C) • A
is used for any vectors A, B, and C.
Recall Gauss’s theorem
11 V • FdA = j (F • v)ds.
It follows that
T T(n x k) • vds = I [ [V- T(n x k)] dA.
SD
Since S is arbitrary, it follows that
putt =V-[T(n x k)].
Now, it is clear that the unit normal for z = u(x, y, t) is equal to
ux 
uy 
1
n = {---- , 
=,---- , 
=, , 
}.
u2 +u2 + 1 
u2 + u2 + 1 u2 +u2 + 1
ux + uy + 
ux + uy + ux + uy +
Since the displacement of the membrane is very small, we approximate
U u2 + u y +1 ^ i.
It follows that
n x k = {-ux, -uy, 0}
and
[T(n x k)] = {0,(Tux), (Tuy)}.
Consequently,
V-[T(n x k)] = (Tux)x + (Tuy)y.
Assume the density of the membrane and tensile force to be constants: p = p0 and 
T = T0 over £2, respectively. Moreover, we neglect a resistance force, then the dis­
placement function u(x, y, t) satisfies
p0utt = T0(uxx + uyy) + f0(x,y,t),
which is the wave equation in two-space dimensions.

140 CHAPTER 5 The wave equation
Just like a string vibration, if there exists a resistance force (damping force), which 
is typically proportional to the velocity, denoted by y0ut, we see that u(x, y, t) satis­
fies
P0utt + Y0ut - T0(uxx + Uyy) = f0(x, y, t), 
(x, y) e ti,t > 0•
Similarly, in three-space dimensions the motion of an elastic solid under a small 
external force f0 can be described by the following wave equation:
P0Utt + Y0ut - T0(Uxx + Uyy + Uzz) = f0(x,y,z,t).
For brevity, we simply write
Utt + YUt — c Au = f, x e ^2, t > 0,
wherex = (x 1 ,x2, ••• ,xn) e Q c Rn, y = p0, c =/p and f = f.
With appropriate initial and boundary conditions, we obtain a mathematical 
model in several space dimensions:
utt = c2Au + f(x,t), 
(x,t) e x (0, rc>), 
(5.3.1)
B[u] = h(x,t), 
(x,t) e dQ x (0, w), 
(5.3.2)
u(x, 0) = g 1 (x),ut(x, 0) = g2(x), 
x e ^, 
(5.3.3)
where B is a boundary operator.
5.3.2 The mathematical model of a sound propagation
A sound propagation is an interesting phenomenon encountered in daily life. There 
are many applications in health and life sciences. We will derive the mathematical 
model based on different physical laws.
It is a well-known experiment that sound does not propagate in vacuum. Sound 
can propagate in air due to the motion of the molecules in the air. We may think of 
the air as a compressible fluid and sound propagates in a compressible fluid.
Now, we consider a fluid that occupies a region c R3. Let p(x, t) be the density 
of the fluid at location x = (x1, x2, x3) e R3 and time t. Let V(x, t) be the velocity 
field of the fluid. Suppose the trajectory of a particle in the fluid is denoted by x(t) =< 
x1(t), x2(t), x3(t) >. By definition, the velocity field V is equal to
x'(t) = V(x(t),t), 
t > 0•
The acceleration of the fluid molecule is equal to
x"(t) = -V + (V ^V)V• 
dt

5.3 Wave propagation in several space dimensions 141
For any subdomain D c , the total momentum of the fluid over the domain D is 
equal to 
p(dV + ( v 'V) v ) 
dt
dx.
Now, the change of total mass of the fluid in D must be equal to the total fluid 
flows out through the boundary of D in the normal direction:
p(x,t)dx = — 
[pV • v(x)]ds,
dt D 
dD
where v(x) is the outward unit normal at x e dD.
Gauss’s divergence theorem implies that
[pt+div(pv)]dx=0,t>0.
D
Since D is arbitrary in , we find that
pt + div(pV) = 0, 
x e &,t> 0.
(5.3.4)
Eq. (5.3.4) is called the continuity equation that holds for all kinds of fluids.
Next, we analyze the force acting on the fluid molecules. There are two types of 
forces acting on the fluid molecules. The first is the Kelvin force or potential force 
due to the pressure p(x, t). The other type of force is the external force, denoted by 
F, such as the gravitational force and resistance force. Therefore the total momentum 
produced by the Kelvin force and external force in D are equal to
— y" (pv)ds + y Fdx,
where v represents the outward unit normal on dD.
The divergence theorem implies that
(pv)ds = 
(Vp)dx.
dD 
D
Since D is arbitrarily in , we obtain
p [V t + (V •V) V] = —V p + F. 
(5.3.5)
Eq. (5.3.5) is called Euler’s equation. For a fluid such as air or gas, the pressure p is a 
nonlinear function of density p . For example, from the physics (see [25]) the relation 
for an ideal gas is given by
p = p1+YRT,
where R = 8.31 is the universal constant for an ideal gas, T is the temperature of the 
ideal gas and y > 0.

142 CHAPTER 5 The wave equation
Therefore we obtain the fundamental equations for the gas dynamics:
Pt + div(pV) = 0, 
x e &,t> 0, 
(5.3.6)
P[Vt + (V •V)V] = -Vp(p) + F. 
(5.3.7)
Now, we make the following physical assumptions:
(a) The fluid movement is small with small velocity and the density varies little with 
respect to t .
(b) The density is proportional to the pressure.
With these assumptions, the nonlinear term (V •V)V is negligible and p(P) = cP 
with some constant c > 0. From the system (5.3.6)-(5.3.7), we find that the pressure 
p(x, t) satisfies the following equation:
Ptt - c2 Ap = f (x), 
(5.3.8)
where
f(x, t) = cVF.
If we prescribe appropriate initial and boundary conditions, then a completed mathe­
matical model for a sound propagation is established.
5.4 Solution of the wave equation in higher space 
dimension
In this section we use the method of separation of variables to find the series solution 
for the wave equation in several space dimensions. Since the idea is the same as for 
the heat equation we give one example with a different domain.
5.4.1 The series solution of the wave equation in a bounded 
domain in Rn
Let be a bounded domain in Rn with C 1-boundary. Consider the following prob­
lem:
utt = c2Au + f (x, t), 
(x, t) e x (0, <x>),
u(x, t) = 0, 
(x, t) e dQ x (0, <x),
u(x, 0) = gi(x),ut(x, 0) = g2(x), 
x e ^,
(5.4.1)
(5.4.2)
(5.4.3)
where f(x, t) e C2(Q^| L2(Q) and g i (x), g2(x) e C2(Q^| L2(Q).
Similar to the one-space dimensional case, we decompose the problem (5.4.1)­
(5.4.3) into two problems:

5.4 Solution of the wave equation in higher space dimension 143
Problem (a) consists of the homogeneous equation, homogeneous boundary condi­
tion, but nonhomogeneous initial conditions. Problem (b) consists of the nonhomo- 
geneous equation, but homogeneous initial and boundary conditions. The solution to 
problem (b) can be obtained from the solution for Problem (a) by using Lemma 5.2.1.
Therefore we focus on the homogeneous equation (5.4.1) where f(x,t)= 0.
Consider the eigenvalue problem:
— A^ = kty, x e ^,
(5.4.4)
ty(x) = 0, x e d&.
(5.4.5)
Suppose we can find all eigenvalues and all corresponding eigenfunctions (all eigen­
functions are chosen to be mutually orthogonal in L2(Q)):
{kk } £=, 
{^(x)} £=.
Suppose g 1 (x), g2(x) e L2(Q). Then, using eigenfunction expansion, we have

where ak (t ) is the solution of the following ODE:
ak(t) + c2kkak = 0, 
t> 0,
ak(0) = Ak,ak(0) = Bk, 
Vk > 1.
We can easily solve the ODE for ak (t):

Then, u(x, t) is the explicit series solution of the problem (5.4.1)-(5.4.3) with f = 0. 
We summarize the above derivation to obtain the following theorem.

for g 1 (x) and g2(x), respectively. 
□
5.4.2 The series solution of the wave equation in a disk in R2
From Theorem 5.4.1, we see that a crucial step for finding the explicit series solution 
is to find all eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions. We use one example here 
to demonstrate the procedure.
Let a>0 and
D = {(x, y) e R2 : x2 + y2 < a2}.
Consider the following problem:
utt = c2Au + f(x,y, t), 
(x,y,t) e D x (0, ro), 
(5.4.7)
u(x,y, t) = 0, 
(x,y,t) e dD x (0, rc>), 
(5.4.8)
u(x, y, 0) = g1(x, y), ut(x, y,0) = g2(x, y), 
(x, y) e D. (5.4.9)
We begin with the case where f(x, y, t) = 0.
Since D is a disk, it is convenient to introduce polar coordinates:
x = r cos Q, y = r sin 0.
In polar coordinates, u = u(r,Q,t) satisfies
utt = c2(urr + 1 ur + -12uqq), 
(r,Q) e D,t> 0, 
(5.4.10)
r r2
where
D = {(r, Q): 0 < r < a, — n < Q < n}.
Suppose
u(r, Q, t) = h(t)^(r)^(Q).
From Eq. (5.4.10) we see that
h" (t) = ^" (r) + 1 ^' (r) 
^" (Q) = - ^
c2h(t) 
^(r) 
”1” r2^(Q) 
’
where k is an unknown constant.

5.4 Solution of the wave equation in higher space dimension 145
On the other hand, we separate ^(0) and $(r) as follows:
^ " (0) 
^(0)
= r 2[ x + ^1+^- ]:= ,.
$(r)
where ^ is an unknown constant.
Since u(r, 0 ) is smooth in D, we see that
ty(—n) = fi(n),
^' (—n) = ^' (n).
It follows that ^(0) satisfies the following eigenvalue problem with periodic 
boundary conditions:
^ " (0) + fa<^(0) = 0, 
— n<0<n, 
(5.4.11)
ty(—n) = n(n), 
ty' (—n) = ty' (n\ 
(5.4.12)
Hence, the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions from Chapter 3 are
» 0 = 0, 
^ o (0) = 1
and
fam = m2, 
^m(0) = cos(m0), sin(m0), m = 1, 2, ••• .
Once p,m is found, we can find $(r):
$"(r) + 1 $'(r) + (X — m2-)^(r) = 0, 
0 < r < a, 
(5.4.13)
r 
r2
$(a) = 0, |^(r)| < ^. 
(5.4.14)
This is the Bessel equation and its solution is
^m(r) = Jm(r ^X),
where X is chosen such that Jm(as/X) = 0.
For each m, the Bessel function has an infinite number of roots (see [26]), which 
are all positive.
Suppose xn(m) are the positive zeros of the Bessel function Jm(z). Then,
Xnm = x^- )2, 
n = 1, 2, ••• ,m = 0, 1,2, ••• .
a
From the equation for h(t), we see the general solution for h(t) is equal to
I t (m) \ 
/ t (m) \
hnm(t) = B1 nm cos ^-^ + B2nm sin c-x^ ,
aa
where B1nm and B2nm are determined by the initial conditions.

146 CHAPTER 5 The wave equation
Hence, the solution u(r, 0, t) can be expressed as the following series:
co co 
(m)
u(r,0,t) = ££ JmC-xn— ^A1 m cos(m0) + A2m sin(m0)]

where coefficients B1nm and B2nm can be determined uniquely from the initial values.
□
5.5 The well-posedness and energy estimates
In this section we investigate the well-posedness of the wave equation. The basic idea 
is similar to the heat equation.
Let c Rn be a bounded domain with C 1-boundary and QT = x (0,T) for 
any T>0. Throughout this section we assume that the following basic conditions 
hold:
H(5.1) Let p(x, t) > po > 0 and pt(x, t), q(x, t) e L"°(QT) and y > 0.
H(5.2) Let f(x,t) e L2(QT) and g(x) e H1 (Q), h(x) e L2(Q).
Consider the following problem:
utt + Yut + L[u] = f (x, t), x e £2,t > 0, 
(5.5.1)
B[u] = 0, 
(x,t) e dQ x (0, o), 
(5.5.2)
u(x, 0) = g(x),ut(x, 0) = h(x), 
x e ^, 
(5.5.3)
where the operators L and B are defined by
L[u] := —V[p(x, t)Vu] + q(x, t)u, 
B[u] := ap(x, t)Vvu + fiu,
where a2 + p2 > 0.
5.5.1 The weak solution and the energy estimate
For simplicity, we focus on the Dirichlet boundary condition:
B[u] = u(x,t) = 0, 
(x,t) e dQ X (0, o).
Other types of boundary condition can be dealt with similarly.
Definition 5.5.1. We call u(x, t) a weak solution of the problem (5.5.1)-(5.5.3) if 
u(x,t) e H1 ((0,T); L2(^))C|L2((0,T); H1^)) and the following integral iden­
tity holds for all v(x,t) e H1 (0,T); L2(^))P| L2(0,T); HJ(^)) with v(x, T) = 0 

5.5 The well-posedness and energy estimates 147
in :
y y [—utvt + Yutv + PVu •Vv + quv] dxdt = j h(x)v(x, 0)dx.
Moreover,
lim ||u(x,t) — g||l2(Q) = 0. 
t ^0+
Clearly, it is easy to verify that a classical solution to the problem (5.5.1)-(5.5.3) 
must be a weak solution. Conversely, the weak solution is also classical ifitis smooth. 
The following energy estimate is similar to the case for the heat equation.
Theorem 5.5.1. Under the assumptions H(5.1)-H(5.2) the weak solution of the prob­
lem (5.5.1)-(5.5.3) is unique and continuously depends on the known data in the 
L2-sense. Moreover, the solution satisfies the following energy estimate:
sup [ [u2 + |Vu |2]dx < C ( (g2 + |Vgi2 + h2)dx + C f f f2dxdt,
0<t <T Q 
Q 
0 Q
where C depends only on p0, a, fl, Q, T and the L“-norm of p, pt,q in their do­
mains.
Furthermore, if y > 0 and q(x, t) = f(x, t) = 0, then
|| ut || L2 (Q) + ||V u || L2 (Q) < Ce Yt,
where C depends only on known data.
Proof. Let us consider the case with a = 0,fl= 1. We define an energy function
E(t) := 1 / [|ut |2 + p(x,t) |Vu |2] dx.
Then,
E'(t) = j [ututt + p(x,t)Vu •Vut]dx + 2y (pt |Vu i2)dx 
= j [ ut(utt — V (p(x,t) V u) ] dx + (pt |V u |2 )dx 
= j [—Yuj + ut(—qu + f) ] dx + 1y (pt |V u |2 )dx 
:=I+J.
We use Cauchy-Schwarz’s inequality and Poincare’s inequality to see that
|I|<C1
(ut2 + u2)dx + C2 f2dx

148 CHAPTER 5 The wave equation
< C3j (U + |Vu|2)dx + C2^ f2dx.
For J , since pt is bounded,
|J|<C3 
(|vu|2)dx.
It follows that
E'(t) < C4E(t) + C2^ f 2dxdt,
where C2 ,C4 depend only on known data.
Gronwall’s inequality yields
E(t)<C(T)E(0)+C(T) 
T 
f 2dxdt.
When y > 0 and q(x, t) = f(x, t) = 0, we have
E'(t) + Y y u2dx < 0.
To obtain the decay estimate, we need a result from Chapter 7 that
lim 
ut2dx = lim 
|vu|2dx.
t^“ Q 
t^TO Q
It follows that
E(t) < Ce-Yt,
where C depends only on known data. 
□
5.5.2 The existence and regularity of a weak solution
Similar to the heat equation, we use the finite-element method to prove the existence 
of a weak solution to the problem (5.5.1)-(5.5.3). We use the Dirichlet boundary 
condition as an example and briefly sketch the basic steps.
Theorem 5.5.2. Under the assumptions ofH(5.1)-H(5.2), there exists a unique weak 
solution to the problem (5.5.1)-(5.5.3).
Proof. The proof of the existence can be obtained from the following steps.
Step 1. Construct an approximate solution.
We choose an orthonormal basis {^n(x')}n=1 for L2(Q) and ^k(x') e C“(Q) with 
^(x) = 0 on d&.. We employ the eigenfunction expansion to have
oo
f(x,t) ^2 fk(t)^k(x),
k=1

h(x) ^22hk^k(x),
where
fk(t) = < f, <k >, gk = < g, <k >, hk = < h, <k >, 
Vk > 1.
Let N > 1 and set
N
uN(x, t) ^2aN(t)<k(x), 
(x, t) e Q x (0, ro),
k=1
where ak (t) is the solution of the following system of ODE:

k = 1,2... ,t> 0, 
(5.5.4)

ak (0) = hk, 
(5.5.5)
while
B[UN,<k] := 
[p(vUN) • (v<k) + quN<k] dx.
a
Under the assumptions H(5.1)-H(5.2), the theory of ODEs ensures that the system 
(5.5.4)-(5.5.5) has a global solution {a^ (t)}.
Step 2. Derive the uniform estimate for the approximate solution.
This estimate is very much like the energy estimate in Theorem 5.5.1. By using 
the positivity of p and boundedness of pt ,q we have
sup [ll (uN)t || L2 (Q) + ||V UN || L2 (qJ < C, 
0< t < T
where C depends only on known data, but not on N .
Step 3. Prove that the limit of a convergent subsequence of uN (x, t) is a weak solu­
tion.
First, we use the weak compactness of L2(QT) and the compact embedding the­
orem in Sobolev space (see [5]) to extract a convergent subsequence (still denoted by 
uN (x , t )). Then, from the system of ODEs, we obtain an integral identity (5.5.4) for 
uN (x , t). Finally, we take the limit to conclude that u(x, t) is a weak solution to the 
problem (5.5.1)-(5.5.3).

150 CHAPTER 5 The wave equation
To prove the uniqueness, we only need to show that u(x, t) = 0 when f = g = 
h = 0. Choose the test function v(x, t) as follows: for any 5 e [0,T],
fS u(x,r)dr if 0 < t < s,
0 
if s < t < T.
v(x, t) =
Then, we can easily see that u(x, t) = 0 is the only weak solution (see [8]). 
□
The regularity of the weak solution is a difficult topic for the wave equation. For 
this book we just state that the weak solution is indeed classical if the coefficients 
and known data are smooth and the compatibility conditions hold on dQ x {t = 0}. 
A detailed proof for a general hyperbolic equation can be found in the book [8]. We 
omit it here.
5.6 A qualitative property: The finite propagation speed
A distinct feature for the solution of a wave equation is that the propagation speed of 
the wave is finite. Let (x0 ,t0) be a fixed point with t0 > 0. Define a cone with vertex 
(x0 ,t0):
t0
C(x 0 ,t0) = {(x, t) e Q : | x - x o| < t0 - ct, 0 <t < —}.
Let B(x0, t) be the ball centered at x0 with radius t. It is clear that B(x0, t0) is the 
bottom of the cone C(x0, t0), see Fig. 5.5.
FIGURE 5.5
Theorem 5.6.1. Let u(x, t) be a solution of the wave equation
utt — c2Au = 0, 
x e &,t > 0.

5.7 The Cauchy problem for the wave equation 151
Let (x0,t0) e £2 x (0, rc>) such that C(x0,t0) c x (0, rc>).
If
u(x, 0) = ut (x, 0) = 0,xe B(x0, t0), 
then
u(x, t) = 0, 
(x,t)e C(x0, t0).
Proof. Let B(x0, t0 - ct) be the intersection ball of the cone C(x0, t0) and the hyper­
plane T = t0 - ct . Define an energy function
E(t) =2^ 
[ u2 + c 2|V u 12] dx, 
0 <t < ”0.
Then,
E'(t) = y 
[ututt + c2Vu •Vut]dx — 
[u2 + c2|Vu|2]ds
= 
[ ut(utt — c 2Au) ] dx + — 2

—-^ 
[ u2 + c 2|V u |2] ds
= c 2 y 
ut V vuds -2^ 
[ u2 + c 2 |V u |2] ds.
Now, Cauchy-Schwarz’s inequality yields
c 2 y 
ut V vuds — 2^ 
[ u2 + c 2|V u |2] ds.
It follows that
E'(t) — 0, 
0 <t<t0.
Consequently,
0 — E(t) — E( 0) = 0, 
0 <t<t0. 
□
The physical meaning of Theorem 5.6.1 is interesting. The value of u(x, t) at 
(x0 ,t0) depends only on the value of the initial position and initial velocity in the 
disk B(x0, t0). This is due to the fact that the speed of the wave propagation is finite.
5.7 The Cauchy problem for the wave equation
In this section we derive the solution representation ofa Cauchy problem for the wave 
equation.

152 CHAPTER 5 The wave equation
5.7.1 Duhamel’s principle
Let f(x,t) e C1 (Q), g(x),h(x) e C2(Q). The following consistency condition 
holds:
-c2Ag(x) = f(x, 0), x e Rn.
Consider the following Cauchy problem for the wave equation:
utt — c2Au = f(x,t), 
(x,t) e Rn x R +, 
(5.7.1)
u(x, 0) = g(x), ut(x,0) = h(x), 
x e Rn. 
(5.7.2)
We first decompose the problem (5.7.1)-(5.7.2) into the following three problems in
which each problem has only one nonhomogeneous term:
Problem (I):
utt — c2 Au = 0, 
(x, t) e Rn x R +,
u(x, 0) = g(x), ut(x, 0) = 0,xe Rn.
(5.7.3)
(5.7.4)
Problem (II):
utt — c2Au = 0, 
(x, t) e R x R +,
u(x, 0) = 0,ut (x, 0) = h(x), 
x e Rn.
(5.7.5)
(5.7.6)
Problem (III):
utt — c2 Au = f (x, t), 
(x, t) e Rn x R +,
u(x,0)=0,ut(x,0)=0, 
xe Rn.
(5.7.7)
(5.7.8)
It is clear that the solution of problem (5.7.1)-(5.7.2) is the sum of the solutions for 
P(I), P(II), and P(III).
Theorem 5.7.1. (Duhamel’s principle) Let u1, u2, and u3 be the solutions of P(I), 
P(II), and P(III). Suppose u2(x, t) = Mg (x, t) is the solution of P(II) associated with 
an initial velocity g(x). Then,
(a) ui(x,t) = — Mg(x,t), 
(x,t) e R x R +,
dt 
T
(b) 
u3(x,t) = M Mf(T)(x,t — r)dr, (x,t) e R x R +.
0
Proof. We first prove (a). We assume that u1 (x, t) is smooth and satisfies the wave 
equation up to t = 0.
Clearly, u1 (x, t) = Mg (x, t) satisfies the wave equation (5.7.1). By definition,
ui(x, 0) = T-Mg^)1t=0 = g(x), x e Rn.
dt 
=

5.7 The Cauchy problem for the wave equation 153
We use the wave equation to see that
u 1 t(x, 0) = d-2Mg(x, t) = c2kMg(x, 0)|t=0 = 0, 
x e Rn.
It follows that u1(x, t) is a solution of the problem (I).
To probe (b), we note that, for any fixed t > 0,
w(x,t) := Mf(r)(x,t - t)
solves the following problem:
wtt — c2Aw = 0, 
(x, t) e Rn x (t, <x),
w(x,0)=0, 
xeRn,
wt (x, 0) = f(x,t), xe Rn.
Now,
u3(x, t) := 
Mf(t)(x, t - t)dt.

The proof of (b) is completed.

154 CHAPTER 5 The wave equation
5.7.2 Representation for n = 1: D’Alembert’s formula
Consider a special case where the space dimension is equal to 1:
utt - c2Uxx = f(x, t), 
(x, t) e R1 x (0, ro),
u(x, 0) = g(x), x e R1, 
ut(x, 0) = h(x), 
x e R1.
We begin with the homogeneous equation by setting f = 0. 
Introduce new variables:
^ = x + ct, n = x — ct.
Set
v(£, n) := u(x, t).
It is easy to see that Eq. (5.7.9) is equivalent to
v^, n) = 0.
It follows by a direct integration that
v(^,n) = p(^) + q(n),
where p(^) and q(n) are two arbitrarily differentiable functions. 
Namely,
u(x, t) = p(x + ct) + q(x - ct).
From the initial conditions (5.7.10)-(5.7.11), we have
p(x) + q(x) = g(x), x e R1, 
cp'(x) — cq'(x) = h(x), 
x e R1.
From Eq. (5.7.12), we see that
p'(x) + q'(x) = g'(x), 
x e R1.
It follows that
P' (x) = 1 g' (x) + 71 h(x).

Hence,
p(x) = p(0) + 1[ g'(y)dy + ~ h h(y)dy

On the other hand,
q(x) = g(x) - p(x) = 1 g(x) + 1 g(0) - 71 h h(y)dy - p(0).
2 
2 
2c 0

u(x, t) = p(x + ct) + g(x - ct)
= 1 [g(x - ct) + g(x + ct)] + 
h(y)dy.

2c x-ct
Finally, we use Duhamel’s principle to obtain the solution representation for the prob­
lem (5.7.9)-(5.7.11):

We sum up the above derivation to obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 5.7.2. (D’Alembert’s formula) Let g(x),h(x) e C2(R1) and f(x,t) e 
C(R1 x R +). The consistency condition holds:
-c2g"(x) = f(x, 0), 
x e R1.
Then, the solution of the problem (5.7.9)-(5.7.11) is equal to
u(x,t) = ^[g(x - ct) + g(x + ct)] + ^ h h(y)dy
2 2c x-ct

/• t f x + c(t - T)

From D’Alembert’s formula, we see that if the initial values g(x), h(x ) and 
f(x, t) have compact support at each level t, then u(x , t) must have a compact sup­
port for each t>0, see Fig. 5.6. This implies that the propagation speed of sound is 
finite. We will see this property again in higher-space dimensions.
5.7.3 Solution representation for space dimension n = 3
To derive the solution representation, we introduce a spherical mean function below 
that will reduce the Laplace operator to a one-dimensional differential operator. For 
convenience, we take c = 1.
Suppose u(x, t) satisfies
utt — Au — 0,
xe Rn,t>0.

Moreover, from the initial conditions we see that
U(x,r,0) = G(x, r), Ut (x, r, 0) = H(x, r),
where
G(x, r) =- g(y)ds(y), H(x, r) =- h(y)ds(y).
Consider the case where n = 3. Define
U (x,r,t) = rU(x,r,t), G (x,r) = rG(x,r), 
H (x,r) = rH(x,r).
It is easy to see U(x,r,t) is the solution of the following problem:
Utt - Urr = 0, 
(r,t) e R + x (0, <x), 
(5.7.16)
U(x,r, 0) = G(x,r), 
r > 0,

r > 0, 
(5.7.18)

U (x, 0 ,t) = 0, 
t> 0. 
(5.7.19)
If we use an odd extension for G and H to (-rc>, 0] (extended functions are denoted 
by the same notation), then we have from Theorem 5.7.2 the solution 
0 < r < t,

where we used the odd extension G (x, r -t) = G (x, t - r), since r < t.
Now, we are ready to state the following theorem.
Theorem 5.7.3. (Kirchhoff’s formula) Let g(x) e C1 (R1) and h(x) e C(R1). For 
n = 3, the solution of the problem (5.7.14)-(5.7.15) can be expressed as
u(x,t) = - 
[th(y) + g(y) + Vg(y) • (y - x)] ds(y), 
x e R3,t > 0.

5.7.4 Solution representation for space dimension n = 2: Method of 
descent
The method in derivation of Kirchhoff’s formula for n = 3 fails for n = 2. Here, we 
simply consider the problem (5.7.14)-(5.7.15) as a special case where the solution of 
the wave equation does not depend on the third variable.

5.7 The Cauchy problem for the wave equation 159
Theorem 5.7.4. (Poisson’s formula) Let g(x) e C1 (R2) and h(x) e C(R2). For n = 
2, the solution of the problem (5.7.11)-(5.7.12) can be expressed by

Proof. The basic idea is that we consider the problem (5.7.14)-(5.7.15) in R3 with 
special initial data that depend only on two variables. Let u(x1,x2,t) be a solution of 
the wave problem (5.7.14)-(5.7.15) in two-space dimensions. Set
x = (xi,x2), x = (x 1 ,x2, 0), u(x 1 ,x2,x3,t) := u(x,t).
Then, u satisfies the following problem in R3 x R +:
utt — ku 0, e R x R +,
u(x, 0) = g(x), ut(x, 0) = h(x), x e R3,
where
gj(x) = g(x1,x2), 
hj(x) = h(x1,x2), 
x e R3.
By Kirchhoff’s formula, we have
u(x, t ) = uj(xj , t )

where
Bjt(xj) = {(y1,y2,y3) : (y1 - x1)2 + (y2 - x2)2 +y32 < t2}.
To calculate the surface integral, we express the surface dBt(x) in explicit form:
y3 =± t2 -|y - x|2, 
ye Bt(x).
Then, on dBt(x), |y — x|2 = t2, we find that
ds(y) = J 1 + |V y3|2 dy =

5.7.5 Domain dependence, data disturbances, and Huygens 
principle
For the homogeneous problem where f(x,t) = 0, from the representation of u(x , t) 
in R2 and R3 , we find a very interesting phenomenon. When the space dimension 
n = 3, the value of u at (x0, t0) depends only on the value of known data along the 
surface of Bt0-ct (x0). On the other hand, when the space dimension n = 2, the value 
ofu at (x0, t0) depends on the known data in Bt0 (x0). The ball Bt0-ct (x0) is called the 
domain dependence. dBt0-ct (x0) is called the data disturbance. This phenomenon for 
n = 3 is often referred to as the Huygens principle.
For a more physical interpretation, the front water wave propagation in a lake 
depends on all the waves inside of the front wave disk. On the other hand, the sound 
propagation in R3 depends only on the surface of the ball Bt(x). The sound waves do 
not interfere with each other when t increases.
5.8 Notes and remarks
The materials in Section 5.1 to Section 5.3 are elementary. Great effort was made 
in these sections to establish several mathematical models for the wave-propagation 
phenomenon. These mathematical models will help students and researchers in ap­
plied fields to better understand wave propagation. The nonlinear Euler’s equation is 
still a very active research topic in compressible fluid mechanics. Sections 5.4 and 
5.5 are basic materials for theoretical study for the wave equation. The regularity of 
the weak solution for the wave equation is extremely challenging, since the regularity 
of the solution depends on the regularity of the initial and boundary values; even the 
coefficients in the equations are smooth. This is very different from the heat equation 
and the Laplace equation. It is known in advanced PDEs that the solution to the heat 
equation is smooth as long as the coefficients of the equation is smooth. However, the 
smoothness of the weak solution for the wave equation depends on the smoothness 
of the initial and boundary values as well as the coefficients of the equation.
The representation of the solution for the Cauchy problem is very elegant. The 
presentation in Section 5.7 closely follows Evans’ book ([8]). It reveals many inter­
esting phenomena for the solution of the wave equation.

6.1 Some mathematical models of the Laplace equation
In this section we derive some mathematical models governed by the Laplace equa­
tion and its generalization. All of these models arise from mathematical and physical 
sciences.
6.1.1 The steady-state equations of evolution equations in the 
physical sciences
The first example is that the Laplace equation may be considered as the steady-state 
equation of an evolution equation in the physical sciences. The long-time behavior of 
the solution to an evolution equation relies on the deep understanding of the solution 
of the steady-state equation. Here, we give a few examples as motivation.
Example 6.1.1. The steady-state equation for some evolution equations:
(a) The steady-state equation for the heat conduction with a heat source f (x):
—k2Au = f(x), 
x e ^.
(b) The steady-state equation for the wave propagation with an internal force 
f(x):
—c2Au = f(x), x e ^.
(c) The steady-state equation of the Schrodinger equation with potential v(x):
—Au + v(x)u = 0, 
x e ^.
(d) The steady-state equation of an electric field.
When an electric field E is static, physical experiments show that it can be ex­
pressed as the gradient of a potential function:
E := —Vu.
If p(x) is the charge density in , then the conservation of charge implies
V- E = p(x).

166 CHAPTER 6 The Laplace equation
It follows that
—Am = p(x).
The second motivation of the Laplace equation comes from the minimization 
problem, which is referred to as the calculus of variation.
6.1.2 The minimization of kinetic energy: Calculus of variation
Consider a bounded domain in R3. For a physical quantity v such as velocity in a
channel, the total kinetic energy in is given by
I |Vv|2dx. 
a
If there is an external force, denoted by f(x) e L2 (Q), it is natural to study an energy 
functional:
E(v) := - y |Vv|2dx — y f(x)vdx.
A natural question in physics is to find the minimum of such a kinetic-energy func­
tional. This leads to a mathematical question: Find m(x) in a function space A such 
that
E(m) = min E(v).
veA
The set A is typically a subset of C1 (Q). We have to impose a condition on d& in 
order to determine m(x) uniquely. For example, we may assume that
A ={v(x) e C1 (Q): v(x) = 0, x e dQ}.
One can impose different types of condition on the boundary. The set A is called an 
admissible set in optimization theory. With the mathematical formulation, how do we 
find such a minimum?
We first derive a necessary condition. Suppose E(v) attains its minimum at m e A. 
Let t be a parameter. For any v e A, consider
I(t) := E(m + tv) > E(m), t e R1.
It follows that I(t) attains its minimum at t = 0. Hence, I'(0) = 0.
Now,

. I(t) — I( 0)

If m e C1 (Q), we use Gauss’s divergence theorem to obtain
[(Am + f(x))v(x)]dx = 0, 
v e A.

6.1 Some mathematical models of the Laplace equation 167
Since v(x) e A is arbitrary and A is dense in C1 (Q), it follows that u(x) is a solution 
of the following equation:
—Au = f(x), 
x e ^,
u(x) = 0, 
x e dQ.
By a similar calculation, it is easy to see that
I ” (0) > 0,
which ensures that the functional E(v) attains a minimum at u e A. This procedure 
is called the Calculus of Variation.
6.1.3 The minimum-surface equation
We give another interesting example that is important in physics and mechanics as 
well as in differential geometry. Suppose a simple closed curve C in R3 is given by
C : z = z(x,y), (x,y) e dto,
where is a region in R2.
The surface with the boundary C is denoted by v(x, y). Then, the surface area is 
given by
J(v):
y y ^1 + v2 + vydxdy.
We are interested in finding a surface with the minimum surface area. Mathematically, 
this is equivalent to finding the minimum of J(v) among all possible differentiable 
functions with v = z(x, y) on the boundary of .
If we define the admissible set
A = {v(x, y) e C1 (Q): v(x, y) = z(x, y), 
(x, y) e d&}.
We can perform the same calculation as for the kinetic-energy functional J(v) in 
Section 6.1.2 to obtain that the minimum surface u(x, y) satisfies
r 
V u
V 
, 
„ = 0, 
(x,y) e ^,
V1 + |V u |2
u(x,y) = z(x,y), 
(x,y) e dQ.
When |Vu| is small, we can approximate the minimum surface by the Laplace 
equation:
Au = 0, 
(x, y) e ^,
u(x,y) = z(x,y), 
(x,y) e dQ.

168 CHAPTER 6 The Laplace equation
6.1.4 The Cauchy-Riemann equation in complex analysis
As a fourth example, we consider the fundamental equation in complex analysis.
Recall that a complex function f(z) is called analytic in a region £2, if the Cauchy- 
Riemann equation holds in ^2
=0,
where z = x + iy and z = x — iy.
A fundamental problem in complex analysis is to determine whether or not a 
complex f (z) is analytic in a domain c R2.
Now, we rewrite the complex function f(z) as real and imaginary parts:
f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y), (x,y) e Q.
Note that
fz- = dr — dr) [ u(x,y) + iv(x,y) ]. 
dz dx dy
It follows that
(ux + vy- + i( — uy + vx- = 0, 
(x,y) e ^.
Consequently,
ux + vy = 0, 
— uy + vx = 0, 
(x, y) e ^,
which is equivalent to
uxx + uyy = 0, vxx + vyy = 0, (x, y) e ^.
This shows that f (z) is analytic in if and only if Ref(z) and Imf(z) are harmonic 
functions. Many properties for analytic functions can be derived from the harmonic 
functions.
6.2 Series solution for the Laplace equation
In this section we first present a general result for the Laplace equation associated 
with appropriate boundary conditions. We then give several examples on how to find 
a series solution in terms of the eigenfunctions.
6.2.1 A general boundary value problem for the Laplace equation
When the dimension is equal to 1, the Laplace equation becomes an ODE, which is 
the Sturm-Liouville theory discussed in Chapter 3. We now focus on the problem in 
a domain in Rn with n > 2.

6.2 Series solution for the Laplace equation 169
Let £2 be a bounded domain in Rn with a smooth boundary d&. Suppose f(x) e 
L2(Q) and g(x) e L2(d&). Consider the following boundary value problem:
- Am = f (x),
B[u] = g(x),
x e ^, 
x e d&,
(6.2.1)
(6.2.2)
where B is a general boundary operator:
B [ m ] = a V vm + fiu,
a2 + fi2 > 0,
the vector v is the outward unit normal on dQ.
Obviously, by proper choice of the parameters a and fi the boundary operator B 
contains all three types of boundary conditions that are discussed in previous chap­
ters.
We are interested in the well-posedness for the problem and the solution repre­
sentation. The examples in Chapter 1 indicate that the problem (6.2.1)-(6.2.2) may 
not have a solution even with a classical boundary condition.
To find a solution to the problem (6.2.1)-(6.2.2), we may split the problem 
(6.2.1)-(6.2.2) into two problems:
Problem (I) (Nonhomogeneous equation with a homogeneous boundary condition):
— Am = f(x), 
x e ^,
B [m] = 0, x e d&.
(6.2.3)
(6.2.4)
Problem (II) (Homogeneous equation with nonhomogeneous boundary condition):
— Am — 0, x e ^2, 
B[m]— g(x), 
x e dQ.
(6.2.5)
(6.2.6)
It will be seen that the solvability for Problem (I) depends on the eigenvalue prob­
lem (6.2.7)-(6.2.8), while the solvability for Problem (II) depends on the boundary 
eigenvalue problem (6.2.9)-(6.2.10) below.
Now, we consider the following eigenvalue problem:
— A^ — Xfi,
B [ ^ ] — 0,
x e &., 
x e dQ.
(6.2.7)
(6.2.8)
If we know there exist an infinite number of eigenvalues {Xn}^=1 and all correspond­
ing eigenfunctions M — {^n(x')}n= 1 form a mutually orthogonal basis for L2(Q), 
then we can find a series solution for Problem (I).
We need to divide the eigenvalues for the operator in Problem (I) into two cases.
Case 1: 
X — 0 is not an eigenvalue for the eigenvalue problem (6.2.7)-(6.2.8).

then, u(x) is a series solution of the problem (6.2.1)-(6.2.2).

Without loss of generality, we assume that X0 = 0 is an eigenvalue. Let
N0 (B) = span {all mutually orthogonal eigenfunctions corresponding to X 0 = 0}.
We would like to see the structure of the subspace N0(B). From the Rayleigh 
quotient that a = 0. Hence, the boundary condition (6.2.4) becomes
Vvu = — — u := bu, 
a
x e d&,
where b = - -.
a
(a) If b = 0, the boundary condition (6.2.4) becomes
V vu = 0,
x e dQ.
From the Rayleigh quotient, the corresponding eigenfunction 00 must satisfy
I |V<p0|2dx = 0.

6.2 Series solution for the Laplace equation 171
Therefore the corresponding eigenfunction must be a constant. We choose the corre­
sponding eigenfunction $0(x) = 1. It follows that dim N0(B) = 1 and
No (B) = span {^ 0 (x) = 1}.
By applying the Fredholm Alternative, we see that the problem (I) has a solution for 
f(x) e L2(Q) if and only if
< f, 40 > = f f(x)dx = 0.
(b) If b = 0, then from the Rayleigh quotient, the corresponding eigenfunction 
$h(x) must satisfy
y |V$h |2dx — b $hds = 0.
It follows that only when
b>0,
an eigenfunction possibly exist. In this case, if an eigenfunction ^h(x') does exist, it 
must satisfy the following necessary condition:
$h(x)ds = 0.
a^
Next, we want to find value of b such that the space N0 (B) is not empty. This 
leads to a different eigenvalue problem on the boundary.
Consider the following boundary eigenvalue problem: Find b > 0 and ^(x) such 
that
A^ = 0, 
x e Q, 
(6.2.9)
Vv^ = W, x e dto. 
(6.2.10)
From Chapter 3 we know that there exist only one eigenvalue and one eigenfunction 
when the space dimension is equal to 1. If the space dimension is greater than 1, then 
there exists a set of eigenvalues on the boundary, denoted by,
Sb := {0 = b 0 < b 1 < b 2 < • •• <bn, •• •},
where
lim bn = to. 
n ^'X.
Similar to the eigenvalue problem (6.2.7)-(6.2.8) in a bounded domain, the first pos­
itive eigenvalue for the boundary eigenvalue problem (6.2.9)-(6.2.10) can be found 
as follows:
|Vu|2dx
b 1 = min 
.
u(x) e H1 (Q) J^ull2 ds

172 CHAPTER 6 The Laplace equation
One can follow the same procedure to find b 2 ,b 3, ■ ■■. Let Nm(B') be the subspace of 
the span of all eigenfunctions corresponding to the eigenvalue bm .
By applying the Fredholm Alternative, we see that the problem I has a solution 
for every f(x') l L 2 (Q) if b / X-b .On the other hand, if b l X-b, say, b = bm for some 
m > 0, then the problem I has a solution for f(x) l L2(Q) if and only if
<f,4m> = 0, 
V$m L Nm(B).
A special case is that for b0 = 0 and the boundary condition (6.2.4) is given by the 
homogeneous Neumann type:
Vvu(x) = 0, 
x L 9Q.
In this case, every eigenfunction in N0(B) must be a constant and dim N0(B) = 1. 
Let
c0 
U u(x)dx.
| |
Then, Poincare’s inequality yields:
j^<- - c0)2 < *oj |V0h i2dx,
where s0 is a positive constant (called the Sobolev constant). It follows that a neces­
sary condition for bn for n > 1 is
bn > —, 
n = 1, 2, ••• .
*0
Since the set of all eigenfunctions is mutually orthogonal in L2 (Q) and forms a
basis for L2 (Q), except for c0, we follow the same procedure to obtain
To find c0, we take an inner product u(x) with $0 l N0. Note that
?c
u(x) = c0 + 
cn^n(x),
n=1
where
cn = an, 
n = 1,2, ••• .
^n
<<h,$0 > = 0, 
n = 1, 2, ••• .
We see that
< u, $o > = co|Q|.

6.2 Series solution for the Laplace equation 173
It follows that
< u,n0 > 
1
c 0 =------------= u(x)dx.
0 I | 
| Q | a
As long as we can find c0, we can uniquely determine the solution.
Moreover, from the Fredholm Alternative, the problem (6.2.3)-(6.2.4) has a solu­
tion if and only if f(x) e N-
< f(x), $h > = 0, V nn e Nn(B), n = 0, 1, 2, ••• .
In particular, for the Neumann boundary condition, in order for the problem (I) to 
have a solution, a necessary and sufficient condition is
f (x)dx = 0.

We summarize the above analysis to obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 6.2 .1. Suppose all eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of 
(6.2.7)-(6.2.8) are given by
{In } ~1, 
{ ^n(x) } ~1.
Moreover, we choose {^n(x)} to be mutually orthogonal in L2 (Q) and form a basis 
of L2(Q). Let f(x) e L2(Q) and
TO
f(x) = y^tallX)n(x).

unique series solution:

(b) 
If k = 0 is an eigenvalue to (6.2.7)-(6.2.8), there are two cases:
Case 1: b /Eb with b := - a.
Then, the problem (I) has a solution for all f(x) e L2 (^).
Case 2: b e Eb. Suppose b = bm e Eb for some m > 0.
Then, the problem (I) has a solution for every f(x) e L2 (Q) if and only if
<f,^m> = 0, 
Vmm(x) e Nm(B),
where Nm(B) is the eigenspace corresponding the boundary eigenvalue bm.

174 CHAPTER 6 The Laplace equation
In particular, when fi = 0, the necessary and sufficient condition of the solvability 
for the problem (I) is
f (x)dx = 0.
The series solution is given by
u(x) = c0 +
TO an
n=1
where
c0 = 77=77 U u(x)dx. 
| |
The solution is unique in the sense that the difference between any two solutions to 
(6.2.3)-(6.2.4) must be a constant.
Proof. The regularity theory for elliptic equations ([12]) shows that all eigenfunc­
tions are smooth in . With the smooth result, one can easily verify that 
(x) =

solves the problem (6.2.3)-(6.2.4).
The proof for other cases is similar.
□
For Problem (II) with a nonhomogeneous Robin boundary condition, we have a 
similar result. Let g(x) e L2(9^) with n > 2. Consider the following problem:
Au = 0, 
x e Q,
(6.2.11)
Vvu = au + g(x), 
(x,y) e 9Q.
(6.2.12)
Theorem 6.2 .2. Suppose all eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of
(6.2.9)-( 6.2.10) are given by
Sb :={bn}~1,
{ fn(x') } ~1.
Moreover, we choose {fn(x)} to be mutually orthogonal in L2 (9^) and form a basis 
of L2(9^). Let g(x) e L2(9^) and
TO
g(x) = aptanx/n(x), 
n=1
x e 9Q.
Then,

6.2 Series solution for the Laplace equation 175
(a) if a / Yb, then the problem (6.2.11)-(6.2.12) has a unique solution for any 
g(x) l L2(d^).
(b) if a = bm for some m > 0, then the problem (6.2.11 )-(6.2.12) has a solution if 
and only if g(x) is orthogonal to fh (x) for all fh n Nm(B) under the inner product
< v1,v2 >:= 
v1(x)v2(x)ds(x),
where Nm(B) is the subspace of L2 (dQ.) that is the span of all eigenfunctions cor­
responding to the eigenvalue bm . In particular, when a = 0, the problem (II) has a 
solutionfor every g(x) l L2 (dQ.) if and only if

6.2.2 Series solution for the Laplace equation in some special 
domains
When a domain has a special structure, we can find the series solution for the problem 
(6.2.1)-(6.2.2) explicitly. The basic steps are as follows:
Step 1: Find all eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions for the eigenvalue 
problem (6.2.7)-(6.2.8) for Problem (I) (or the eigenvalue problem (6.2.9)-(6.2.10) 
for Problem (II)). Use the Gram-Schmidt process to choose all eigenfunctions corre­
sponding to each eigenvalue to be mutually orthogonal.
Step 2: Determine whether or not X = 0 is an eigenvalue for the corresponding eigen­
value problem. We use Theorem 6.2.1 or Theorem 6.2.2 to express u as a series of 
eigenfunctions and find these unknown coefficients.
Example 6.2.1. Let R = [0,L] x [0,H] and g(x) R L2(0,L). Find the series solution 
for the following problem:
- Am = 0, 
(x,y) R R, 
(6.2.13)
u(0,y) = u(L,y) = 0, 
0<y<H, 
(6.2.14)
my (x, 0) = 0, my (x, H) = g(x), 
0 <x<L. 
(6.2.15)
Solution. First, we need to determine whether or not X = 0 is an eigenvalue. Consider 
the eigenvalue problem:
— Am = Xu, x R R, 
(6.2.16)
m(0,y)=m(L,y)=0, 
0<y<H, 
(6.2.17)
mx(x,0)=0,mx(x,H)=0, 
0<x<L. 
(6.2.18)
By using the separation of variables, we know from Example 3.4.1 in Chapter 3 that 
the eigenvalues are
nn )2+(mn )2
LH
n = 1, 2, ... ,m = 0, 1, 2, ■ ■■
Xnm =

176 CHAPTER 6 The Laplace equation
The corresponding eigenfunctions are
<hm(x, y) = sin (nnx) cos (my), 
LH
n = 1,2, ■ ■■ , m = 0, 1,2, ■ ■■ .
It follows that X = 0 is not an eigenvalue for the eigenvalue problem (6.2.4)-(6.2.5) 
and the problem (6.2.13)-(6.2.15) has a unique solution for any g(x) e L2(0,L).
We may use the general method introduced above to transform the problem into 
the problem I with a homogeneous boundary condition. Here, we use a direct way to 
find the series solution.
Let
u(x,y) = <p(x)h(y), 
(x,y) e R.
The Laplace equation (6.2.1) becomes
$"(x)h(y) + $(x')h"(y) = 0, 
(x, y) e R.
Equivalently, we have
4"(x) 
h" (y) _
-------—---------- — — X, 
$(x) h(y)
where X is an unknown constant.
It follows that
<fr"(x) + X^(x) — 0, 
0 <x<L,
<K 0) — $(L) — 0.
Moreover,
h " (y) — Xh(y) — 0, 
h' (0) — 0.
0<y<H,
We already know that all eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions for $(x) are
Xn — (nn , 
^n(x) — sin (~Lxx),n — 1,2, •’’ •
On the other hand, once Xn is found, the general solution for h(y) is equal to
nny 
nny
hn(y) — Ae~ + Be—
where A and B are arbitrary constants.
The boundary condition h' (0) — 0 implies A — B .It follows that
hn(y) — A [ enL + e—nt ] — 2 A cosh (nYy).

6.2 Series solution for the Laplace equation 177
Consequently, for all n > 1,
Un (x,y) = sin (nL-) cosh (nLy)
satisfies the Laplace equation and all boundary conditions except on y = H . 
We set a series solution in the following form:
u(, y) =
to 
E 
n=1
An sin(nLLx) cosh(nLy).
where An will be chosen later. 
Then,
TO
uy(x, H) = ^-j-n sin (—) sinh (^—).
LL 
L
n=1
On the other hand, we can express g() over [0, L] as a sine series:
TO
g() = E 
n=1
gn sin(nL-),
where
gn = 
g(x) sin (nnx)dx, 
n = 1.2. ■■■ .
L0 
L
If we choose An such that
gn = nA sinh (nnLH), 
n=1,2....,
then,
uy (-, H) = g(-), 
0 <-<L.
Hence, the series solution to the problem (6.2.13)-(6.2.15) is equal to
u(, y) =
TOE
n=1
An sin(nLx) cosh(nLy).
where

One can easily extend the method to a rectangular domain in R3 (see Exercise 9 
in Exercises 6.8).

178 CHAPTER 6 The Laplace equation
The next example deals with the Laplace equation in a disk in R2.Leta>0 and
Ba(0) = {(x, y): x2 + y2 < a} = {(r, 0): 0 < r < a, — n <6 < n}.
For this case it is convenient to express the Laplace equation in polar coordinates. 
Note that
x = rcosS, y= r sinS,
_ d d 
dx, dy
=< cos 0----- r sin 0—, sin 0 —+ r cos 0 — > •
It follows that v(r, S) := u(x, y) satisfies
_ 1 d dv 1 d2v _ 
r dr^ dr r 2 d02
Since u(x, y) = v(r, S) is smooth in Ba (0), we see that
v(r, — n) = v(r,n),
ve(r, — n) = ve(r, n).
Moreover, v(r, S) must be bounded in Ba (0). This leads to the following problem.
Example 6.2.2. Let f (0) e L2(—n, n). Find the series solution for the following 
problem:
1 d[rlU] + -12122 = 0, 
(r,0) e Ba(0), 
(6.2.19)
r dr dr 
r2 d02
u(r, — n) = u(r,n), ug(r, — n) = ug(r,n), 
0 < r < a, (6.2.20)
u(a,0) = f(0), 
— n < 0 < n, 
(6.2.21)
|u(0,6)| < rc>.
Solution. We follow the same idea by using the method of separating variables. Let
u(r,0) = $(9)G(r), 
(r,0) e Ba(0).
The Laplace equation foru is equivalent to 
r d t dG. 
^" (0)
G(r)dr^r~dT’ = — ^(0) '
where X is an unknown constant.
Equivalently, ^(0) satisfies
(r,0) e Ba(0),
— ^"(0) = X^(0), 
— n <0 <n,
(6.2.22)

6.2 Series solution for the Laplace equation 179
$(—n) = <p(n), <p'(—n) = $'(n). 
(6.2.23)
Moreover, G(r) satisfies
y-( 
) ~~ G(r) = 0, 
0 <r<a,
dr dr 
r
|G(0) | < ^.
We already know the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions to (6.2.22)-
(6.2.23):
X 0 = 0 ,<p 0 (0) = 1
and
Xn = n2, $n(0) = cos (n0), sin (n0), n = 1,2, ■■■ .
Now, G(r) satisfies
r2G"(r) + rG'(r) — n2G = 0, 
0 < r < a.
To find the general solution for G(r), we set
G(r) = rp, 
0 <r <a.
Then, we have
[p(p—1)+(p—n2)]rp=0,
which implies that p = ±n, n = 1, 2, • 
Hence, the general solution is
G(r) = c 1 rn + c2r-n, 
n = 1, 2, ••• .
For n = 0, we obtain G(r) = 1 is one solution. To find another solution that is 
linearly independent of 1, we note that
d. (/.Gl) = 0,0 <r<a. 
dr dr
It follows that
dG(r)
r------- = c 1, 0 < r < a.
dr
Thus
G(r) = c1lnr + c2, 
0 <r<a,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. 
Note that
|u(0,0)| < rc>.

180 CHAPTER 6 The Laplace equation
It follows that all linearly independent solutions for G(r) with |G(0) | < to must have 
the following form:
Gn(r) = rn, 
n = 0, 1,2, ••• .
Namely,
un(r, d) = Anrn cos (nd) + Bnrn sin (nd),
n = 0, 1, 2, ••• .
We set the series solution in the following form:
TO
u(r, d ) = A0 +

To satisfy the boundary condition u(a, d) = f(d), we only need to choose

6.3 The well-posedness of the Laplace equation
In this section we study the well-posedness of a self-adjoint elliptic operator L de­
fined in Chapter 3. The basic tool is based on the Lax-Milgram theorem in Chapter 2. 
The result provides the theoretical foundation that justifies the results obtained in Sec­
tion 6.2.
6.3.1 The well-posedness
Let be a bounded domain in Rn with Lipschitz boundary dQ. We first focus on 
the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. The well-posedness for a nonho- 
mogeneous case and other boundary conditions are parallel to the heat equation in 
Section 4.3 in Chapter 4. The existence theory is based on the Lax-Milgram theo­
rem.
H(3.1) Let p(x), q(x) e LTO(Q) with p(x) > p0 > 0 and q(x) > 0 on .
For f (x) e L2(Q), we consider the following problem:
L[u] := —V[p(x)Vu] + q(x)u = f(x), 
u(x) = 0, x e dQ.
x e Q,
(6.3.1)
(6.3.2)

6.3 The well-posedness of the Laplace equation 181
Definition 6.3.1. We call u(x) a weak solution of the problem (6.3.1)-(6.3.2) if 
u(x) e H01 (Q) and
[ [p(x)Vu •Vv + q(x)uv]dx = j f(x)v(x)dx, 
(6.3.3)
for all v(x) e H01 (Q).
Clearly, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 6.3.1. A classical solution of (6.3.1)-(6.3.2) must be a weak solu­
tion. Conversely, if a weak solution is smooth, then it is a classical solution of 
(6.3.1)-(6.3.2).
Theorem 6.3.1. Under the condition H(3.1) for every f(x) e L2(Q) the problem 
(6.3.1)-(6.3.2) has a unique solution u(x) e Ho1 (AZ). Moreover the solution is smooth 
in if p(x) and q(x) are smooth in Q.
Proof. Define a bilinear form on H01 (Q) x H01 (Q):
B[u, v]:= 
[p(x)Vu •Vv + q(x)uv] dx.
Q
By H(3.1) and Cauchy-Schwarz’s inequality, we see that
|B[u, v]| < C||u||H 1fQJ|v||H 1fQv 
V(u, v) e H01 (Q) x H01 (^),
Ho (kJ) 
Ho (kJ) 
o 
o
where C depends only on the upper bounds of p(x) and q(x).
Moreover, since q(x) > 0 and the norm of Ho1 (Q) is equivalent to
||V u || L 2 (□),
we find that
B[u,u]> po||u||H1 (Q), 
Vu e H01 (Q).
The Lax-Milgram theorem yields that for every f (x) e L2(Q) there exists a unique 
u(x) e Ho1 (Q) such that
B[u, v] = < f, v >, 
Vv(x) e HJ(Q).
The uniqueness is obvious since for any two weak solutions u1 and u2, u = u1 - u2 
satisfies
B[u, v] = o, Vv e HJ(Q).
We choose v = u to see that u(x) = o on .
The regularity of the weak solution can be proved in an advanced PDE book, such 
as [12]. 
□

182 CHAPTER 6 The Laplace equation
Note that the nonnegativtity of q(x) is important when employing the Lax- 
Milgram theorem. Next, we investigate the solvability for the operator L subject to 
the general Robin condition.
Let g(x) e L2(9^). Consider the following problem:
L[u]:=-V[p(x)Vu]+ q(x)u = 0, 
x e Q, 
(6.3.4)
B[u] := p(x)Vvu + c(x)u(x) = g(x), x e 9Q. 
(6.3.5)
A weak solution to the problem (6.3.4)-(6.3.5) can be defined similarly.
Definition 6.3.2. We call u(x) to be a weak solution of the problem (6.3.4)-(6.3.5) 
if u(x) e H1 (Q) and
[ [p(x)Vu •Vv + q(x)uv] dx + j c(x)u(x)v(x)ds = j g(x)v(x)ds, (6.3.6)
for all v(x) e H1 (Q).
Theorem 6.3.2. Let the assumption H(3.1) be in force and c(x) > c 0 > 0 over 9Q 
for some c0 > 0. Then, for every g(x) e L2(9^) the problem (6.3.4)-(6.3.5) has a 
unique solution u(x) e H1 (^).
Proof. For the problem (6.3.4)-(6.3.5) we define the bilinear form:
Bi[u, v] = y [(Vu) • (Vv)] dx + y u(x)v(x)ds, Vu, v e H1 (^).
Note that the norm of H1 (Q) is equivalent to (see [23])
||V u IIL2 (Q) + IIu IIL2 (9Q).
Since c(x) > c0 > 0, one can easily verify that the bilinear form B1[u, v] satisfies 
the Lax-Milgram conditions. It follows that the problem (6.3.4)-(6.3.5) has a unique 
solution u(x) for every g(x) e L2(9^). 
□
Remark 6.3.1. For the existence result in Theorem 6.3.2, the positivity condition 
for c(x) can be dropped. However, one needs a condition for the sign of c(x) for the 
uniqueness.
By using the energy method, we can obtain the continuous dependence on f(x) 
in L2 (Q)-space.
Corollary 6.3.1. Let H(3.1) hold.
(a) If ui(x) is the solution of (6.3.1)-(6.3.2) corresponding to fi(x) for i = 1, 2, 
then,
IIV (u 1 - u 2 ) IIL 2 (□) < CII f1 - f2IIL 2 (□);

6.4 A qualitative property: The mean-value formula 183
(b) Let c(x) > c0 > 0. If ui(x) is a solution of (6.3.4)-(6.3.5) corresponding to 
gi (x) for i = 1, 2, then
||V (u 1 — u 2 ) || l 2 ($) < C ||g 1 — g 21| l 2 (d&),
where C depends only on the known data.
Proof. We give a proof for (a) with the Dirichlet boundary condition. Let u(x) := 
u1 (x) — u2(x). Then,
[p(x)|Vu|2 + q(x)u2]dx = 
(f1 — f2)udx.
Since p(x) > p0 > 0 and q(x) > 0, we have
poj |Vu|2dx < s^ u2dx + C(s) j (f1 — f2)2dx
< ssof |V u |2 dx + C(s) I (f1 — f2)2 dx.
If we choose s sufficiently small, then the desired estimate holds in L2 (Q). 
□
6.4 A qualitative property: The mean-value formula
There are many interesting properties for a harmonic function. We introduce one of 
them here.
Let be a domain in Rn and let u(x) satisfy
Au = 0, 
x e ^.
6.4.1 The mean-value formula and subharmonic functions
Theorem 6.4.1. Let u(x) be a harmonic function in Q. Then, for any ball Br(x) c ^,
u(x) =— u(y)ds (y) =— u(y)dy.
Proof. Let x e be fixed. Define
^(r) =- u(y)ds(y) =— u(x + rz)ds(z).
It follows that
f'(r) = — Vu(x + rz) • zds(z).
dB 1 (0)

184 CHAPTER 6 The Laplace equation
Note that the outward unit normal on dBr(0) is equal to x.
Hence,
$' (r)=—B{ )V u(y) • y-xdsy)
= — 
V vu(y)ds(y)
dBr(x)
= - — Audy = 0.
n Br (x)
Here at the final step, the divergence theorem is used.
Therefore $(r) must be a constant in .
On the other hand,
lim <p(r) = — 
u(y)ds(y) = u(x).
r ^° 
dBr(x)
It follows that
u(x) =- u(y)ds(y).
Note that
y U u(y)dy = y y u(y)ds(y)dt = u(x) j na(n)tn-1 dt = a(n)rnu(x).
This concludes the proof of Theorem 6.4.1.

The significance of Theorem 6.4.1 shows that the value of a harmonic function 
at the center of a ball in a region depends only on the value on the surface of the 
ball. Conversely, one can show that the function must be a harmonic function if this 
property holds in any ball in the region.
Definition 6.4.1. A function u(x) is called a subharmonic function on if
—Au < °, 
x e ^2.
From the proof of the mean-value formula, we obtain a direct consequence.
Corollary 6.4.1. If u(x) satisfies
Au > ° 
(or < °), 
x e ^,
then, for any Br(x) c ^,
u(x) <— u(y)ds(y) =— u(y)dy, x e ^. □

6.5 The maximum principle and applications 185
6.5 The maximum principle and applications
Similar to the heat equation, the maximum principle holds for the Laplace equation. 
This property is fundamentally different from the hyperbolic equation. It is a very 
powerful tool in the study of general elliptic equations.
6.5.1 The maximum principle
The idea of the maximum principle comes from the calculus. When a smooth func­
tion has a local maximum at an interior point x = x0, then the Hessian matrix of the 
function at x = x0 is seminegative-definite. This gives a way to estimate the maxi­
mum and minimum values of the function over the domain.
Theorem 6.5 .1. (The weak maximum principle) Let c(x) > 0 on Q. Suppose u(x) e 
C2 (&) n C(S2) satisfies
L[u] := — Au + c(x)u < 0, x e ^.
Then,
u(x) < max{0, maxu(x)}, 
x e Q.
da
Proof. We first assume that c(x) > c0 > 0 on . If u(x) attains a positive maximum 
at an interior point x0 e , then at this point,
—Au > 0,c(x0)u(x0) > 0.
Hence,
L[u]|x=x0 > 0,
a contradiction with the assumption. It follows that
u(x) < max{0, max u(x)}.
da
For a general case, we just use ce(x) := c(x) + e to replace c(x). Then, we obtain
ue(x) < max{0, maxu(x)}. 
da
By taking the limit as e ^ 0, we conclude the desired estimate. 
□
A direct consequence of Theorem 6.5.1 is the following a priori estimate.
Corollary 6.5.1. (The weak maximum principle) Let c(x) > 0 on Q. Suppose u(x) e 
C2 (Q^| C(S2) satisfies
L[u] := — Au + c(x)u = 0,
x e ^.

186 CHAPTER 6
The Laplace equation
Then,
min{0, minu(x)}< u(x) < max{0, maxu(x)}, x e ^. □
A strong version of the maximum principle is the following theorem.
Theorem 6.5 .2. (The strong maximum principle) Let £2 be a bounded and connected 
domain in Rn with C2-boundary. Suppose u(x) e C2(^^|C(S2) satisfies
— Au < 0 
(or > 0), 
x e ^2.
Then, u(x) cannot attain its maximum (or minimum) in the interior of £2 unless it is 
a constant in Q. Thus
maxu(x) = maxu(x), x e £2.
In particular, if u is a harmonic function in ^, then
min u(x) = min u(x), max u(x) = max u(x). 
a 
a^ 
q 
a^
Proof. Let M = maxu(x). Suppose u(x) attains its maximum at a point x0 e £2. 
Define
^M = {x e £2 : u(x) = M}.
Clearly, QM is closed and nonempty. On the other hand, for any x0 e 1ZM such that 
Br(x0) C £2, then, we have
0 = u(x0) — M < ^ ) n f (u — M)dx < 0,
which yields u(x) = M in Br(x0). Consequently, QM is open and also relatively
closed in £2. Hence, 1ZM = £2. 
□
In dealing with problems with a Neumann boundary condition, we may need a 
different type of maximum principle.
Theorem 6.5 .3. (Hopf’s lemma) Let £2 be a bounded domain with C2-boundary and 
let u(x) satisfy
—Au > 0, 
x e ^2.
If u(x) attains a maximum M at a boundary point x0 e a<2 and u(x) < M in a 
neighborhood N(x0) Q Q. Then,
au ।
av lx=x0 > ,
where v is the outward unit normal at x = x0.

6.5 The maximum principle and applications 187
Proof. First, we note that for any C2-function w(x), if w(x) attains a maximum at 
x0 e d&. in a neighborhood of x0, then
dw(x) 
“ | x = x 0 > 0,
dv
where v is the outward unit normal at x0.
Since d& e C2, there exists a small ball Br(y0) c 
and x0 e dBr(y0) such that
u(x) < M, x e Br (y0).
For simplicity, we assume y0 = 0. Define an auxiliary function 
v(x) = e-X1x 12 - e-Xr2,
where X will be chosen later. Then,
- Av = e - X1 x |2 [-4 X 2| x |2 + 2 nX ].
In R := Br (0) - Br/2 (0), if we choose X sufficiently large, then 
— Av < 0, 
x e R.
Note that
u(x0)>u(x), 
x e N(x0^''|^.
We can choose e sufficiently small to obtain
u(x0) > u(x) + ev(x), x e dBr/2(0).
Since v(x) = 0 on dBr(x0), we see that
u(x0) > u(x) + ev(x), x e dR.
Let w(x) := u(x) + ev(x) - u(x0). Then,
—Aw > 0, 
xeR
and w < 0 on dR. The maximum principle implies
u(x) + ev(x) - u(x0) < 0,xe R.
Note that
[ u(x) + ev(x) — u(x 0) ]| 
= 0.
x=x0
It follows that

6.5.2 Applications
The maximum principle can be used in many applications. We give an application in 
theoretical analysis as an example.
Theorem 6.5.4. Let be a bounded domain in Rn with C2-boundary and c(x) > 0 
and f(X), g(x) e C(^). Suppose that u(x) is a solution of the following equation:
L[u] := — Au + c(x)u = f(x), x e ^, 
(6.5.1)
u(x) = g(x), x e dQ. 
(6.5.2)
Then,
||u||o < C[|| f ||o + ||g|o],
where C is a constant that depends only on &..
Proof. Suppose lies in the slab 0 < || <d0. Define an auxiliary function
v(x) := max |g(x)| + (ed0 — ex1)|| f ||0, 
x e Q.
a^
Then,
— A(v — u) > 0, x e ^.
On dQ,
v(x) — u(x) > 0.
The maximum principle yields
maxu(x) < max v(x). 
□
The method used in the proof of Theorem 6.5.4 is quite powerful. As a direct 
consequence, we immediately obtain the uniqueness and continuous dependence for 
the solution of the problem (6.5.1)-(6.5.2). The crucial step is to construct a suit­
able comparison function. Another direct consequence is the following comparison 
principle. We will show more applications in dealing with nonlinear equations in 
Chapter 8.
Corollary 6.5.2. (Comparison principle) Let c(x) > 0 on Q. Let ui be the solution 
of(6.5.1)-(6.5.2) corresponding to fi(x) and gi(x), i = 1,2 .If
fi (x) < f2(x),
gi (x) < g2(x),

then,

Example 6.5.1. Let 
be a bounded domain in Rn with C2-boundary. Find all solu­
tions for the following nonlinear problem:
— Au = u( 1 — u), x e ^2,
Vvu = 0, 
x e da.
Proof. Obviously, u1(x) = 0 and u2(x) = 1 are two solutions. We claim that there 
is no other solution. Indeed, the maximum principle shows that any solution must 
satisfy
0 < u(x) < 1, x e ^.
On the other hand, from the equation we find that
u(1 — u)dx = 0.
It follows that there is no solution other than u(x) = 0 or u(x) = 1. 
□
6.6 An L™(Q)-estimate: Moser’s iteration method
In this section we present an iteration method to derive an L“ (Q)-estimate without 
using the maximum principle under a weaker assumption on f (x). The method can 
be used to derive the DiGorgi-Nash’s estimate for a general elliptic equation. We 
begin with an elementary iteration lemma.
Lemma 6.6.1. Let g(t) be a nonnegative and monotone decreasing function on 
[ko, rc>). Moreover, for some positive constants M > 0 and a > 0, P > 1, g(t) satis­
fies
g(h) < ((h Mkr) g(k)P, V h > k - k 0.

From the definition of kn, we find kn ^ k0 + d and g(k0 + d) ^ 0 as n ^ —.

Define
u+(x) = max{u(x), 0},
u- = min{u(x), 0}.
Theorem 6.6.1. Let q(x) > 0 in and f(x) e Lp(Q) with p >n. Then, a solution 
u(x) of (6.3.1) satisfies the following estimate:
||u||L-(□) < supU + + c|| f |l n^, 
dQ 
Ln+p(Q)
where C depends only on p0 and | |.
Proof. Let n > 2 (the case for n = 1,2 is trivial). Let k0 = supdQ u(x). For k > k0, 
define
A(k) = {x e Q : u(x) > k}, 
g(k) = |A(k)|.
Clearly, g(k) > 0 and g(k) is monotone decreasing on [k0, -). Set
f(x) := (u — k)+, 
x e ^.
We multiply Eq. (6.3.1) by f(x) and integrate over to obtain:

where
F0 =||f ||p*.
On the other hand, if h>kwe have
||4||2* < c0||V$||2.
We find that
||4||2* < CFog(k)1 — 1.
By using Lemma 6.6.1, we obtain

Remark 6.6.1. The crucial step in the proof of Theorem 6.6.1 is the Sobolev embed­

continuity for weak solution) for a general elliptic equation in divergence form.

192 CHAPTER 6 The Laplace equation
6.7 Notes and remarks
In applied fields, the Laplace equation and its generalization are used to understand 
the long-time behavior of the solution to an evolution equation. This is particularly 
used for reaction-diffusion systems. There are several ways to establish the well- 
posedness associated with the Laplace equation. We used a method that can be used 
to deal with a general elliptic equation in divergence form. In Chapter 8 we will use 
a different way based on the fundamental solution and Green’s function to obtain the 
solution representation. The maximum principle is a powerful tool in the study of 
nonlinear elliptic equations (see [12,20]).
The study for the solution of the Laplace equation (harmonic function) is a very 
active research topic in harmonic and complex analyses. Many problems in differ­
ent geometries are equivalent to the solvability for nonlinear elliptic equations. The 
materials in this chapter and Chapter 8 will provide a good starting point to conduct 
further research in this direction.
For the beginners, Sections 6.1 to 6.4 are sufficient. The rest of the sections are 
for graduate students interested in research. The method used in Section 6.5 and 
Section 6.6 is elegant.

CHAPTER
The Fourier transform 
and applications
7.1 Definition of the Fourier transform
We have seen in Chapter 2 that a function in a bounded interval [-L, L] can be 
expressed by a Fourier series. Now, we want to extend the idea for a function defined 
in (-rc>, rc>). In this case we have to introduce an integral transform instead of a 
series.
As the Fourier transform involves complex functions, in this section a function 
may be real or complex. For a complex number z = x + iy e Cn, the complex conju­
gate is denoted by z = x - iy for all x, y e Rn. The complex conjugate of a complex 
function f(z) is denoted by f (z).

This improper integral is called the Cauchy principal value of the integral. In this 
section, all improper integrals are understood in this definition.
This leads to the following definition of the Fourier transform.
Definition 7.1.1. Let f (x) e L1 (Rn). Define an operator F from L1 (Rn) to LTO(Rn) 
by

7.1 Definition of the Fourier transform 199
f (o) := F[f ] = (2n) 2 e ix' of(x)dx.
Rn
f (rn) is called the Fourier transform of f (x).
It is easy to see that the operator F is well defined, linear, and bounded. Moreover, 
we will see that F is one-to-one and the inverse Fourier transform F-1 has an explicit 
form (see Theorem 7.2.1 in the next section).
Definition 7.1.2. Let f (rn) e L1 (R2). The inverse Fourier transform F-1 is defined 
as
f(x) := F-1[f ] = (2n)-2 £* ex■ of(o)do.
Thus
(f)v(o) = f(x), 
if f (x), f (o) e L1 (R2).
Suppose f (o) e L1 (Rn), we see that
F[f](-x) = F-1[f](x).
Let R be the reflection operator from L1(R2) to L1(R2):
R[f](x) = f(-x).
Then, from the definition, we have the following proposition:
Proposition 7.1.1. The operators F andR satisfy the following identities:
F2 = R;
F3 = R ◦ F = F ◦ R;
F4 = I,
where I represents the identity operator and ◦ is the composition of the operators.
From Proposition 7.1.1, we see that F is one-to-one. Therefore the inverse Fourier 
transform exists.

7.2.1 Elementary properties of the Fourier transform
Proposition 7.2.1. For any a e Rn and any real number,

The next proposition involves partial derivatives with a multiindex. Recall that for 
a multiindex a = (a 1, • • • ,an) and x = (x 1, • • • ,xn), we use
xa :=x a 1... xan.
Proposition 7.2.3. Let a be a multiindex. If Da f e L 1 (Rn), then
F [ Daf ] = i |a | 0Rf (^).
Proof. We first assume that f (x) e C0° (Rn). Then, for any Dk := -^ with 1 < k < n 
we perform the integration by parts to see that
F[Dkf ] = (2n)-n/21 n e—ix• mDkf(x)dx
= (irnk)(2n) —n/2 j e—ix•m f(x)dx
= (i^k)f(^).
For any multiindex a = (a 1, • • • ,an), we use the same calculation repeatedly to find 
that
F [ D^f ] = i1 a 1 vaf(v).
For a general case where Daf (x) e L1(Rn), we use a smooth approximation fn(x) e 
C00 (Rn) with
||D^fn — Daf ||L 1 (Rn) ^ 0
as n ^ 0.

F [ Dafn ] = i |a | vf.
As the Fourier transform is one-to-one, we obtain the desired result. 
□
We recall the convolution for two functions f(x) and g(x):
(f * g)(x) := ^ f(x - y)g(y)dy.
Proposition 7.2.4. Let f(x), g(x) e L1 (Rn)ft L2(Rn). Then,
(a) F[f * g] = (2n)n/2 f (v)g(rn),
(b) F[fg] = (2n)-n/2 f (rn) * g(rn).
Proof. (a)

It follows that
F[fg] = (2n)-n/2 f(v) * g(v). 
□
7.2.2 The Fourier inversion theorem
With the above properties for the Fourier transform, we are ready to prove the fol­
lowing Fourier inversion theorem.
Theorem 7.2.1. (The Fourier inversion theorem) The inverse Fourier transform F-1 
exists for every f e L1(Rn) and it can be expressed by
f(x) := F-1[f ] = (2n)-2 
ex'vf (v)dv.
Thus
(f)v = f (x), 
if f(x), f(v) e L1 (Rn).
Proof. By the assumption, we know that f e L1 (Rn). By the dominated convergence 
theorem, we find that

7.3 Applications to the Laplace equation
In this section we will illustrate how to use the Fourier transform to find the solution 
representation for the Laplace equation.
7.3.1 Application to the Laplace equation with a lower-order term
Let f(x) e L1 (Rn^L2(Rn) and a>0. Consider the Laplace equation with a 
lower-order term:
— Am + a2u = f(x), x e Rn.
(7.3.1)
We want to find a smooth solution that is bounded as |x | — rc>.

B(x) := F-1[ 2 A i2]•

To find an explicit B(x), we use the fact that

Remark 7.3.1. When a = 0, the Fourier transform for r(«) = is singular at 
rn = 0, which is not in L1 (Rn). The calculation of its inverse Fourier transform is 
very complicated since one must introduce a generalized Fourier transform.
We give some other examples to illustrate the Fourier transform method to find 
the explicit solution.
Example 7.3 .1. Let g(x) e L1 (R1 ^|Lo (R1). Find a bounded solution in half­
space R+2 :
uxx + uyy = 0,xe R ,y > 0, 
u(x, 0) = g(x), x e R1 •
Solution. Normally, one needs two initial conditions u(x, 0) and uy (x, 0) at y = 0in 
order to have a unique solution. We give one initial condition and also impose that the 
solution must be bounded. The boundedness of the solution in R1 x R + is equivalent 
to a condition at r =Jx2 + y2 = rc>.
Set
ii(rn,y) =   e e-ixmu(x,y)dx.
2nn J—oo
Note that we only take the Fourier transform with respect to x .

7.3 Applications to the Laplace equation 207
Then, we take the Fourier transform of the equation to obtain:
- O.) U + U yy = 0.
The general solution for the above ODE of u is equal to
U (o, y) = C 1 (o)e-oy + C2(oi)e°y,
where C1 (M) and C2 (M) are arbitrarily functions ofM.
Since we require that the solution is bounded, it follows that Ui must be bounded 
for y e R +• Therefore we rewrite the solution in the following form:
Ui(o, y) = C(o)e-y|o|,
where C(o) is any bounded function of o.
Now, from the initial condition we obtain
Ui (o, 0) = gi(o).
It follows that
Ui(o, y) = gi(o)e-y|o|.
We already found from Example 7.1.2 that the Fourier transform for the function
F[e-o|y|] =
V2n M 2 + y 2 ■
It follows that
u(x, y) = F 1[g(o)e y|o|] = 1 f 
"'g'x'2 "'' 2do.
n -OT (x - m)2 + y2
Clearly, u(x, y) is bounded on (x, y) e R 1 x R 1.
Example 7.3 .2. Find a solution in half-space R 1 x R +:
Uxx + Uyy = 0,xe R , y > 0,
U(x, 0) = g(x), Uy (x, 0) = h(x), x e R1.
Solution. We take the Fourier transform with respect to the x-variable. Define
ii(o,y) =   [ e ixou(x,y)dx.
2nn -to
Then,
-M Ui + Uiyy = 0.

208 CHAPTER 7 The Fourier transform and applications
The general solution of the ODE for u is equal to
it(v, y) = c 1 (v)e-vy + c 1 (v)evy.
From the initial condition, we have
u(v, 0) = g(v), uy(v, 0) = hi(v).
It follows that
c 1 (v) + c 2 (v) = g (v),
- vc1(v) + vc2 (v) = h(v).
By solving for c1 and c2, we have
c1 (v) = vrg — h 
2 v
vgi + h 
c 2 (v) = 
-----
2v
Let
G(v, y) = c1 (v)e—vy + c2(v)evy.
Thus
u(x, y) = F—1[G(v, y)].
In general, it is difficult to find the explicit form for the inverse Fourier transform for 
G(v, y).
7.4 Applications to the heat equation
In this section we use the Fourier transform method to derive the solution represen­
tation for the Cauchy problem of the heat equation.
7.4.1 The solution representation for the Cauchy problem of the 
heat equation
The following assumption is assumed throughout this section:
H(7.4.1) Let f(x,t) e L1 (Rn x R + ^|L2(Rn x R +) and g(x) e L1 (R")pL2(Rn').
Consider the heat equation
ut — Am = f(x,t), 
(x,t) e Rn x (0, ^), 
(7.4.1)
u(x,0) = g(x), x e Rn. 
(7.4.2)

7.4 Applications to the heat equation 209
Theorem 7.4.1. Under the assumption H(7.4.1) the solution of the problem 
(7.4.1 )-(7.4.2) can be represented by

Proof. We take the Fourier transform with respect to space variables. Let
ii 
:= F[u].
Ifwe take the Fourier transform for Eq. (7.4.1), we find that
ut + |w|2u = f (w,t), t e (0, ro), 
u(w, 0) = g(w).
It follows that
ii(w,t) = e—t1 w 1 g(w) + y e—(t—T) 1 w 1 f(w,T)dT.
By the inverse Fourier transform, we have that

u(x-‘) = (2n)n/2[ g * F +

F(x, t) = F—1[e—t|w|2].

□
From Theorem 7.4.1, we have the following decay estimate.
Corollary 7.4.1. Let f(x,t) = 0 and g(x) satisfy H(7.4.1). Then, u(x, t ) decays at 
the rate -^.
Another direct consequence is that the speed of heat-wave propagation is infinite.
Let e > 0 and
ge(x) =

0, if lx l >e.

s > 0,
u(x,t) > 0, 
(x,t) g Rn x (0, to).
7.4.2 Solution representation to the Black-Scholes equation
As an application we derive the explicit formula for the Black-Scholes equation.
In modern finance, the stock and bond options play an essential role for stability in 
the financial market. Option-price modeling becomes an important foundation for the 
market. There are several types of option contracts. The most active traded options 
are the European option and American option. We focus only on the European option 
that has an explicit formula.
Let S(t) be a financial asset price such as a stock at time t. A fundamental as­
sumption in the financial engineering is that a financial asset follows the geometric 
Brownian motion:
dS(t)
~st)y = ^dt + adW (t),
where ^ is the expected return rate and a represents the volatility for the underlying 
asset s(t). Let P(s,t) be the option price for the stock s at time t and the value at 
the expiration date t = T is known if a striking price is given. The task is to find the 
option price P(s,0) at current time t = 0.
Let r be the riskless interest rate. Moreover, the dividend for the stock s is ne­
glected. Based on the no-arbitrage principle and Ito’s lemma (see [17]), the option 
price P(s,t) satisfies the following heat equation:
Pt + -a252Pss + srPs — rP = 0, 
s> 0,t > 0. 
(7.4.4)
The option price at expiration date T is fixed. Suppose the striking price of the stock 
is K. Then, the payoff value of the option at T is equal to
P(s, T) = s0,— K
ifs>K, 
if s < K.
Define

N(x) =
e — y~ dy.

Theorem 7.4.2. Suppose the volatility a and the riskless interest rate r > 0 are given. 
Then, the option price P(s, t) has the following representation:
P(s,t) = sN(d1) — Ke—r(T —t)N(d2), 

7.4 Applications to the heat equation 211
where T is the expiration date measured in year and K is the striking price, s = s(t) 
represents the stock price at time t, d1 and d2 are defined as follows:
ln k + (r + 1 22)(T - t) 
d 1 =------------- ---------------- ,
t — — t
d2 = d i — t —I' — t.
Proof. Introduce new variables
x = Ins, t = T — t.
Then, V(x, t) := P(s, t) satisfies
Vt - 12 2 Vxx - (r - 12 2 )Vx + rv = 0 ,x G ( to, to), 0 <t<T, 
(7.4.5)
V(x,0)=(ex-K)+. 
(7.4.6)
Set
V(x, t) = u(x, T)eaT+px,
where constant parameters a and p are chosen later.
The basic idea is that we choose a and p properly to eliminate lower-order terms 
in Eq. (7.4.5).
A direct calculation shows that u(x, t) satisfies
Ut - 222Uxx
= [p22 + r - ^22]ux - [r - p(r - ^22) - 222p2 + a]u.
It follows that
Ut — 2 22uxx = 0,
provided that we choose a and p as follows:
a = — r------((r---- t 2)2, 
p =-------- ..
2 t 2 ( 
2 
) , 
P 2 t 2
Moreover,
u(x, 0) = e—px(ex — K)+, 
—^ < x < ^.
We use the representation for the Cauchy problem of the heat equation to obtain
u(x,t) = [ $(x — y, z)e Py(ey — K)+dy,

After some simplification and substituting back the original variable we find that
V (s,t) = sN(d1) - Ke-r(T -t)N(d2),
where s = s(t) represents the stock price at time t .
The significance of the Black-Scholes formula is that the option price does not 
depend on the expectation of the stock return rate ^.
7.5 Application to the wave equation
In this section we will use the Fourier transform method to derive the solution rep­
resentation for the Cauchy problem of the wave equation. The method is also used 
to prove an interesting split-energy property for the wave equation. The following 
assumption is needed throughout this section.
7.5.1 Solution representation for the wave equation
Consider the following wave equation subject to initial conditions:
utt — c2Au = f(x,t), 
(x,t) G Rn x (0, rc>), 
(7.5.1)
u(x, 0) = g(x), ut(x, 0) = h(x), x g Rn. 
(7.5.2)
H(7.5.1) Let g(x), h(x) G L1(Rn) 
L2(Rn) and f(x,t) G L1(Rn x R+1 )
L2 (Rn x R+1 ).
Theorem 7.5.1. Under the assumption H(7.5.1) the solution to the problem
(7.5.1 )-(7.5.2) has the following representation
u(x,t) = g(x) * m 1 (x,t) + h(x) * m2(x,t) + j f(x,T) * m2(y,T)dT, (7.5.3) 
where
m 1 (x,t) = (cos (ct | y |)v ,m 2 (x,t) = ( sin (ct | y | 
, (x,t) g Rn x R +.
c|y| 
+
(7.5.4)
Proof. We can decompose the problem into two separate problems as in Chapter 5. 
We consider the homogeneous equation first where f(x, t) = 0. Let
ii := F[u].

7.5 Application to the wave equation 213
We take the Fourier transform to Eq. (7.5.1) with respect to x to obtain
utt + c2|y|2« = 0, t> 0, 
(7.5.5)
u(y, 0) = g(y), ut(y, 0) = hi(y), 
y g Rn. 
(7.5.6)
The general solution for Eq. (7.5.5) is equal to
ui (y, t) = c1(|y|) cos(ct|y|) + c2(|y|) sin(ct|y|),
where c1(|y|) and c2(|y|) are two arbitrary functions. 
We use the initial conditions to obtain:
c1(|y|) = gi(y),
c2(|y|)
hi (y) 
c I y I
It follows that
, 
( 
AV i sin(ct |y|) v
u(x,t) = gg cos (ct | y |)) + lh——— I
= g(x) * mi (x, t) + h(x) * m2(x, t),
where m1(x, t) and m2(x, t) are defined as the inverse Fourier transform of cos(ct|y|) 
sin(ct |y |)
and c।y। , respectively.
For the nonhomogeneous problem, we simply take g(x) = 0 and h(x) to be re­
placed by f(x, t) and use the Duhamel principle in Chapter 5 to obtain the solution 
representation. We combine two representations of solutions to obtain the desired 
result. 
□
7.5.2 Explicit representation for space dimensions n = 1 and n = 3
In this subsection we derive the explicit representation for the solution of the wave 
equation when the space dimension is equal to 1 and 3, which is equivalent to finding 
the inverse Fourier transform for m1(x, t) and m2(x, t). It turns out that there is an 
essential difference for even and odd dimensions.
For n = 1, we note that
e-ict|y| + eict |y |
cos (ct | y |) =--------^---------
and we use the property of the inverse Fourier transform to obtain 
(gcos(ctIyI))V= 1 [g(x - ct) + g(x + ct)].
For m2 (x, t), we note that

When the dimension n = 2, we can use the same argument discussed in Chapter 5 
to obtain the same representation as in Chapter 5.
From the solution representation we see that the value of u(x , t) only depends on 
the surface S ={x = (x1, x2, x3) :|x|=ct}. Hence, we have the following Huygen’s 
principle that holds only for n = 3(orn is odd).
Corollary 7.5.1. (Huygens’ principle) Let g(x) = h(x) = 0 on R3\BR (0). Then, 
u(x,t) = 0, 
V|x|2 < (ct — R)2.
Proof. This is directly from the representation.
7.5.3 Potential and kinetic energy
In this subsection we consider the homogeneous wave equation (7.5.1) in Rn. For 
simplicity we take c = 1.
H(7.5.2) Suppose
h(x),g(x), |Vg(x)|e L2(Rn).
Define the energy function as before:
E(t) = - [ ru2 + |Vu|2 dx.
2 Rn
We see that
E(t) = E(0) = - [ rh(x)2 + |Vg|21 dx.
2 Rn
A very interesting property for the wave equation is that the kinetic energy and 
potential energy are equal as t ^ to.
Theorem 7.5.2. Assume that the assumptionsH(7.5.1)-H(7.5.2) hold. Let u(x, t) be 
the solution of the homogeneous wave equation (7.5.1) with f = 0 in Rn. Then,

7.6 Generalized Fourier transform
The Fourier transform defined in Section 7.1 is only valid for functions in L1 (Rn). 
In some applications, one may extend the Fourier transform for a broader class of 
functions including the Dirac-delta function.
Recall the Dirac-delta function 8(x) is defined as follows:
J 0, 
if x = 0
3(x) = 
rc>, if x = 0,
I 8(x)dx = 1.
Rn
The Dirac-delta function 8(x) is not a function in the classical sense. It is called 
a generalized function. There is a rich theory about the generalized function space 
(see [5]). Here, we present an introduction that is needed for the generalized Fourier 
transform.
7.6.1 The fundamental function space and generalized functions 
Definition 7.6.1. A function $(x) e Cx(Rn) is said to be rapidly decreasing as 
|x | ^ +^ if
(1 + 1 x।)k~r(x) ^ 0, 
as |x 
■+x.,
dxa
for any multiindex a = (a 1, ■ ■■ ,an) with k = ^\ nn=11 aj | > 0.
Clearly, the function
f(x)=e-|x|, 
xe Rn
is a rapidly decreasing function. Also, every function in C“ (Rn ) is a rapidly decreas­
ing function.
Let
D(Rn) := {all rapidly decreasing functions}.
Then, it is easy to verify that D(Rn) is a vector space and
C“(Rn) a D(Rn).

218 CHAPTER 7 The Fourier transform and applications
We define a generalized function space
D(Rn) := {all linear continuous transforms from D(Rn) to R1}.
The generalized function space extends the definition of a classical function. For any 
continuous function f(x'), we define a functional Mf from C0°(Rn) as follows:
Mf [^]:=<f,t>:= f f(x)^(X)dx, V^(x) e C0(Rn).
Rn
It is clear that Mf e D(Rn). We can use f instead of Mf for brevity. It follows 
that
C(Rn) c D(Rn).
Recall the Dirac-delta function S(x), we know by the definition that for any 
^(x) e C0
Ms [ ^ ]:=<S,^> = ^( 0).
It is easy to see that Ms is a linear continuous mapping from C00(Rn) into R 1. It 
follows that
s(x) e D(Rn).
7.6.2 The Fourier transform for generalized functions
Now, we extend the Fourier transform for functions in D(Rn) as follows.
Definition 7.6.2. We say the Fourier transform of a generalized function f 
_
f:= F [ f ],
if
< f , ^ >=< f, F[^] >, 
V^(x) e C0(Rn).
Its inverse Fourier transform is defined similarly.
It is easy to prove that all properties of the Fourier transform in Section 7.2 hold 
for the generalized Fourier transform.
The next proposition shows that the definition is the same when f(x) is of class 
L1(Rn).
Proposition 7.6.1. If f(x)e L1(Rn), then
< F [ f ] ,^>=<f, F [ ^ ] >, 
V ^(x) e C 0 (Rn).
Proof. By the definition of the Fourier transform, we have
< f [ f ] ,^> = f J [ f ] ^(y)dy

Example 7.6 .1. Find the Fourier transform for f(x)= xx 28(x — 2), x e R1.
Solution. By definition, we see that
F[f (x)] = < f, F[^] > = x4^(2) = x4 < F[8(x — 2)],^>, 
V^ e C0°(R1).
It follows that
F[f] = x4 .
Example 7.6 .2. Let a > 0 be a constant. Find the Fourier transform for f (r) = 
8(r — a) with r = ^x1 + x2 + x2.
Solution. By the definition, similar to Example 7.6.1 we find that
F[ f] = a sin (a | y |) 
[ f

where | y | ^/y2 + y2 + y2.

220 CHAPTER 7 The Fourier transform and applications
7.6.3 Applications to some classical equations
In this section we give a few examples for some partial differential equations with a 
S-source. It will be seen in Chapter 8 that the solution for this type of PDE is called 
the fundamental solution.
Example 7.6 .3. Find the solution for the Laplace equation with a S-source.
Solution. Consider the Laplace equation with a delta source function in R2:
-A$(x) = S(x), 
x e R2. 
(7.6.1)
Ifwe use polar coordinates, Eq. (7.6.1) is equivalent to
$rr + 1 $r + 42$ee = S(r,0), 
(r,0) e (0, <x) x (0, 2n). 
(7.6.2)
r 
r2
It is clear that the Laplace operator and delta function are invariant under the or­
thonormal transformation of the coordinate. It follows that we may assume that the 
fundamental solution is just a function of r =|x| and integrable in L1 (Rn). Hence, 
Eq. (7.6.2) is equivalent to
$rr + -$r = S(r,0), 
(r,0) e (0, w) x (0, 2n). 
(7.6.3)
r
For any R(r, 0) e C“ (R2), define
R(r) := — f R(r,0)d0.

Then,

then we see that

We can use the same idea to derive the fundamental solution for n> 2. In Chap­
ter 8 we will use a direct approach to derive the general fundamental solution.
Example 7.6.4. Find the solution for the heat equation with the 5-function as an 
initial value.
Solution. Consider the heat equation with a delta-initial value:
ut — Au — 0, 
x e R ,t > 0,
u(x, 0) — 5(x), x e Rn.
(7.6.4)
(7.6.5)
We take the Fourier transform to obtain
u-1' + |y|2u1 — 0, u1 (0) — 1.
It follows that
ui (y,t) — e 1 y |2 t

5-velocity in R3:

u(x, 0) — 0,ut (x, 0) — 5(x).
(7.6.6)
(7.6.7)
Solution. We take the Fourier transform to obtain
{t" + c 2| y |2 it — 0,
ut (y, 0) — 0, ut'(y, 0) — 1.
The unique solution of the above ODE is equal to
u (y,t) — sin<^

r—|y|.

222 CHAPTER 7 The Fourier transform and applications
It follows that
u(x,t)=F-1[ u]=( sin^t))”.
The inverse Fourier transform for the above function depends on the dimension that 
we already obtained in Section 7.5.
7.7 Notes and remarks
The Fourier transform is a convenient tool in deriving the solution representation for 
partial differential equations. However, it is a challenge to prove that the solution has 
sufficient regularity. Most of the derivation is formal. One needs advanced analysis 
tools to justify the derivation. In Chapter 8, we will use different methods to derive 
various solution representations rigorously. The material in Section 7.6 is just a brief 
introduction for the generalized function. The beginners may skip this section without 
any difficulty for the other materials in the book.

8.1 Introduction to the fundamental solution
To see a physical motivation, we consider a point source such as a charged particle 
located at the origin 0 in a vacuum. Then, the density of the electric field is equal to
p(x) = cS(x), x e Rn,
where c is a physical constant.
The conservation of charge implies that the potential function u(x) for an electric 
field E(x) = —Vu satisfies
— Au = cS(x).
This leads us to study a partial differential equation with a point source. A funda­
mental solution for a partial differential equation is a smooth function with isolated 
singular point that satisfies the equation with a point source (Dirac-delta function). It 
serves as an explicit expression for the inverse differential operator.
8.1.1 The definition of the fundamental solution
We begin with a simple case with one variable. Let f(x)e L1 (R1) L2(R1).
Consider
L0[u]:=— u"(x) = f(x), 
x e R1. 
(8.1.1)
Formally, if the inverse of the differential operator L0 exists, then we have
u(x) = L0—1f (x), 
xe R1.
It will be interesting and convenient if we can find the explicit form of the inverse 
1 
operator L0— .
To find such an explicit inverse operator, we consider an auxiliary equation with 
a S-source function with mass at any point x e R 1:
— $"(x,y) = S(y — x), 
y = x,y e R1.

I $(x)dx = 1.
Rn
However, this condition is not necessary.
If we replace the point source by 8(x — y) for any y e Rn, then the functional so­
lution depends on y, denoted by $(x — y). Clearly, we see that $(x — y) is symmetric 
with respect to x and y:
$(x — y) = $(y — x), 
Vx, y e R,x = y.
Moreover, $(x, y) is singular at x = y.
Theorem 8.1.1. Let f(x)e L2(Rn). Suppose L isa self-adjoint differential operator 
of second order and $(x) is the fundamental solution of the operator L. Let u(x) e 
H 2 (Rn) be a continuous solution of the equation
L[u] = f (x), 
xe Rn.
Then,
u(x) = j $(x — y)f(y)dy, x e R.
Suppose that
<&(x,y), $'(x,y) ^ 0 
as |y| ^ rc>.
After taking integration by parts twice, we obtain
u(x) = f ®(x,y)f(y)dy.
R1
If we can find the explicit form for $(x), then we obtain an explicit expression for 
the solution u(x). The function $(x) is called a fundamental solution for the operator 
L0. This leads to the following definition.
Definition 8.1.1. A function $(x) is called a fundamental solution to a partial dif­
ferential equation
L [ u ] = 0, 
x e Rn,
if
L[$] = 8(x), 
x e R\{0}.
Clearly, the fundamental solution may not be unique. We often require that a 
fundamental solution satisfies

Since

Vf e C(R1),
it follows that
®(x) = e-axH(x), 
x e R1
is a fundamental solution to the ODE (8.1.2).
Example 8.1. 2. Find a fundamental solution for the second-order ODE:

where a is a constant. It also follows that
$(x) = a(^ 1 — H(x)) — xH(x), 
x e R1.

228 CHAPTER 8 The fundamental solution and Green’s representation
One may choose a = 0 if $(x) ^ 0 as |x | ^ rc>.
If we replace 8(x) by 8(x - y), then
$(x, y) = a( 1 — H(x — y)) — (x — y)H(x — y).
In the next few sections we will derive the fundamental solutions for some classi­
cal equations.
8.2 The fundamental solution of the Laplace equation
In this section we derive the explicit fundamental solution for the Laplace operator. 
Some properties will be derived from the expression.
8.2.1 The derivation of the fundamental solution
Definition 8.2.1. The solution of the Laplace equation
L0[$]:=— A$ = 8(x), 
x e Rn\{0}, 
(8.2.1)
is called a fundamental solution for the operator L0 with
I $(x)dx = 1.
Rn
Let f(x)e L1(Rn) L2(Rn). Consider the following Laplace equation:
L0[u] := — Au = f(x), x e Rn.
Then, by Theorem 8.1.1,
u(x) = L— 1 f(x) = f $(y — x)f(y)dy, 
x e Rn,
provided that u(x) e H2 (Rn).
To find the fundamental solution of Eq. (8.2.1), we assume that the fundamental 
solution of the Laplace operator is radially symmetric in Rn .Let
$(x) = <£(r),
where r = |x | = ^x2 +----- + xn. Then,

$x,(r) = $' (r)^,
*XiX() = " (rRxy)2 + ' (r)

8.2 The fundamental solution of the Laplace equation 229
Consequently,
A$ = $" (r) + n-1 $' (r) = 0.
r
We assume $' (r) = 0, the general solution is equal to
$(r) =
c1 ln r + c2, if n = 2, 
— + C2, 
if n > 3,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
We choose C2 = 0 and C1 such that
I $( | x | )dx = 1. 
Rn
By using polar coordinates, we find the constant C1 easily.
Theorem 8.2.1. The fundamental solution of the Laplace operator is equal to
$(x) :=
- 2nln |x |,
1_______ 1_
n(n-2)m(n) |x|n-2 ,
ifn=2, 
ifn>3,
where oi(n) is the area of the unit sphere in Rn.
Moreover, for any f(x) e L1 (Rn^| L2 (Rn) the solution of the Poisson equation
—&u = f(x), 
x e Rn,
(8.2.2)
is in H 2(Rn), which can be expressed by
u(x) = J $(x - y)f(y)dy, x e Rn.
Proof. We have seen the expression from Theorem 8.1.1. Here we present a direct 
proof. For any x = y, a direct calculation yields
= n^x - yi)Ix - yI-n,
®xixj = n^(n{|x - y|2&ij- n(xi- yi)(xj- yj)}|x - y|-n-2

Note that for any smooth function u(x), v(x) and any domain c Rn, we have the 
following Green’s identity (3.4.3) in Chapter 3 with p(x) = 1 in :

It follows that for v = $:
J ($(x — y)Au — uA$(x — y))dy = J ($Vvu — uVv&)ds(y).

small ball Bp(x) c and apply Green’s identity in \Bp(x).

8.2 The fundamental solution of the Laplace equation 231
we find
u(x)=Jr '1!i''v - y)f(y)dy.
For n = 2, we use the fact that u e H2(R2) to obtain the same conclusion. The above 
derivation is rigorous as long as the solution is in H2 iRn). This is indeed valid from 
the regularity theory below if f (x) e C(Rn) Q L2(Rn'). 
□
The next example shows that the fundamental solution may be found formally by 
using the Fourier-transform method if the inverse Fourier transform can be obtained 
explicitly.
Example 8.2.1. Let a>0 be a constant. Find the fundamental solution for the fol­
lowing equation
—Au + au = <3(x), 
x e R .
Solution. We use the Fourier transform to obtain
(a + | y |2 )0> (y) = 1.

When a = 0, if we assume that the fundamental solution is a function of |x | only,

v(x) = j ^(x,y)f(y)dy.

Hence, the conclusion follows if f(x) satisfies the condition in (a). To prove (b), we

Corollary 8.2.1. Let u(x) be the solution of the Laplace equation (8.2.2). Then,
(a) If f(x) e L2(Rn), then u(x) e H2(Rn) and
||u||H 2(Rn) < C||f ||L2(Rn).
(b) If f(x) e Ca(Rn)C\L2(Rn), then u(x) e C2+a(Rn) and
|| u || C2+ a (Rn) < C [|| f || C a(Rn) + || f || L2 (Rn)] ,
where C depends only on n.
Proof. For (a), we take a smooth approximation fn(x) e C0°(Rn) with
|| fn - f ||L2(Rn) ^ 0
as n ^ 0. From the solution representation, we see that
|| u || L2 (Rn) + H^ u || L2 (Rn) < C || f || L2 (Rn),
where C is a constant depending only on n.
On the other hand, from the equation we see that
|| ^u || L2 (Rn') = ||f || L2 (Rn').
Note that from the theory of Sobolev space the norm of H2 (Rn) is equivalent to
|| u || L2 (Rn) + || ^u || L2 (Rn).
It follows that the conclusion (a) holds.
The proof of (b) needs delicate estimates for the fundamental solution $(x, y). 
We skip the detail. The reader can find its proof in [12]. 
□
8.3 Green’s functions for the Laplace operator
In this section we extend the idea in the preceding section to find the solution repre­
sentation of the Laplace equation in a general domain in Rn .

234 CHAPTER 8 The fundamental solution and Green’s representation
8.3.1 The definition of Green’s functions
Let £2 be a domain in Rn. Consider the following boundary value problem:
- Am = f(x), x e Q, 
(8.3.1)
m(x) = g(x), x e da. 
(8.3.2)
Let x e . Suppose there exists a function G(x, y) that solves the following prob­
lem:
- AyG = 8(y - x), y e a,y = x, 
(8.3.3)
G(x,y) = 0, 
y e da. 
(8.3.4)
From Green’s identity (3.4.3) in Chapter 3, we have
u(x') = j G(x,y)f(y)dy -j [g(y)Gv(x,y)]ds(y), 
x e a, 
(8.3.5) 
where Gv(x, y) = VyG(x, y) • v(y) and v(y) is the outward unit normal on da.
Definition 8.3.1. For any x e , the solution of the following boundary value prob­
lem:
- AyG = 8(y - x), y e ^, y = x, 
(8.3.6)
G(x,y) = 0, y e da, 
(8.3.7)
is called a Green’s function for the Laplace operator.
We need to answer two basic questions. The first question is what conditions are 
needed for such that a Green’s function exists. The second is to find the Green’s 
function in . We will discuss the basic method to construct Green’s functions in the 
next section.
Theorem 8.3.1. Let a be a domain with a C1 -boundary. Then, there exists a Green’s 
function G(x, y) for the Laplace operator.
Proof. From the definition of Green’s function, we construct G(x, y) from the fun­
damental solution $(x, y). Since we know that the fundamental solution is harmonic 
in Rn except for x = y, x e a, we consider the following auxiliary problem:
- Ay^(x,y) = 0, 
y e a, 
(8.3.8)
^(x,y) = <b(x,y), 
y e da. 
(8.3.9)
Since $(x, y) is smooth on da, there exists a unique solution ^(x, y) (see Chap­
ter 6). It follows that
G(x,y) = ®(x,y) - ^(x,y), y e a,y = x
satisfies all conditions, which is a Green’s function in . 
□

8.3 Green’s functions for the Laplace operator 235
8.3.2 Properties of Green’s functions
Proposition 8.3.1. The Green’s function is symmetric:
G(x,y) = G(y,x), x,y e Q,x = y.
Proof. This is due to the symmetry of the delta function and the fundamental solu­
tion. Indeed, for any z 1 ,z2 e , set u(x) = G(x, z 1) and v(x) = G(x, z2). Then, from 
Green’s identity, we have
[ [G(x, z 1 )&G(x, z2) - G(x, z2)&G(x, z 1)]dx 
a
= 
[G(x, z 1 )Gv(x,z2) - G(x,z2)Gv(x,z 1 \|d5 = 0.
a^
Since
-AG(x,z 1) = 8(x - z 1), 
-AG(x,z2) = 8(x - z2), x e ^,
it follows that
G(z2,z 1) = G(z 1 ,z2), 
z 1 ,z2 e Q. 
□
Theorem 8.3.2. Let n > 3 and aQ e C2. Then,
C
0 <G(x,y) < $(x,y), 
|VxG(x,y)| < ।x - y।n-1, 
x,y e ti,x = y,
(8.3.10)
where C is a constant that depends only on n and a&.
Proof. From Theorem 8.2.2, we know that
G(x,y) = ^(x,y) -/(x,y), y e Q.
The maximum principle yields the first estimate. The second estimate comes directly 
from the fundamental solution. 
□
The reader can find many additional properties for a Green’s function in advanced 
PDE books.
8.3.3 Green’s functions in special domains
In this subsection we introduce a powerful method called the “mirror-reflection 
method” to construct a Green’s function when a domain has a special shape. The 
basic idea is that we use the fundamental solution to construct a Green’s function 
in which a harmonic function with a value along with the boundary is equal to the 
fundamental solution. We use several concrete examples to illustrate the method.

236 CHAPTER 8 The fundamental solution and Green’s representation
Example 8.3 .1. Construct the Green’s function for the Laplace operator L0 in
= R + := {x = (x 1 ,x 2, ■ ■■ ,xn) e Rn : Xn > 0}.
Solution. We start with the fundamental solution $(x, y). What we need is a har­
monic function with 0 value at xn = 0. By the reflection of $(x, y) along yn = 0, we 
see that
G(x, y) = $(x 1, • •• ,xn,y 1, • •• ,yn) - $(x 1, • •• ,xn,y 1, • •• , -yn), 
x,y e Rn.
It is clear that, for any x e Rn, G(x, y) satisfies
- AyG(x,y) = 0, in Rn, 
G(x, y)|yn=0 = 0.
It follows that G(x, y) is the Green’s function.
As an application, we consider the following boundary value problem:
— Au = f(x), 
x e Rn,
(8.3.11)
u(x) = g(x), 
on xn = 0. 
(8.3.12)
Now, the unit outward normal direction v = (0, ■■■ , 0, -1) for the boundary of R +. 
It follows that
Gv(x, y) = -Gyn(x, y) =----- [xn—ynn +
^a[^ |x - y |n
xn + yn 
I x - y | n
On yn = 0, we see that
Gv(x,y) = - Gyn(x,t) =-----n-
n—(n) [ | x - y |n ]
It follows that the solution of the Poisson equation (8.3.11)-(8.3.12) is given by
2xn 
g(y)
u(x) = n-n I. + Tx-Tin dy + JR
Example 8.3 .2. Construct the Green’s function for the Laplace operator L0 in
& = {(x 1 ,x2) e R2 : x 1 > 0,x2 > 0}.
Solution. We start with the fundamental solution $(x, y) = G(x 1 ,x2,y 1 ,y2) in R2.
If we reflect $(x 1 ,x2 ,y 1 ,y2) along the axis y2 = 0 and set
$ 1 (x 1 ,x2,y 1 ,y2) = $(x 1 ,x2,y 1 ,y2) - $(x 1 ,x2,y 1, -y2),
then, we see that
—Ay$ 1 — 0, e ^,
1 | y2 =0 — 0,
y1 e R1.

8.3 Green’s functions for the Laplace operator 237
From $ 1 (x 1 ,x2,y 1 ,y2), we reflect $ 1 along y 1 = 0 and set
$2(x 1 ,x2,y 1 ,y2) = $ 1 (x 1 ,x2,y 1 ,y2) - $ 1 (x 1 ,x2, -y 1 ,y2).
Then, we see $2 (x 1 ,x2 ,y 1 ,y2) satisfies
- Ay$ 2 = 0 ,y e ^, 
$ 2| y 1=0 = $ 2| y 2=0 = 0 , 
y 1 £ R.
It follows that $2(x 1 ,x2,y 1 ,y2) is the Green’s function for £2.
Example 8.3 .3. Construct the Green’s function for a ball in Rn associated with the 
Laplace operator,
= {x = (x 1 ,x2, ••• ,xn): |x| < 1}.
Solution. For any point x e B 1 (0), we define a refection of x e B 1 (0) about dB 1 (0), 
denoted by x, as follows:
x
x —, x e B 1 (0).
It is clear that x e Rn\B 1 (0) and x ^ 1 as x ^ dB 1 (0). For any x e B 1 (0), let
-^(x,y) be the solution of the following problem:
- Ay^(x,y) = 0, 
y e B 1 (0),
^(x,y) = <b(x,y), y e dB 1 (0).
Now, define
G(x, y) = $(x, y) - ^(x, y).
Then, it is clear that G(x, y) is harmonic in B 1 (0) and G(x, y) = 0 on dB 1 (0). We 
claim that
^(x,y) = $(|x|(y - x)), 
x,y e B 1 (0).
Indeed, for n > 3 and any fixed x e B 1 (0), fh(y - x) is harmonic in B 1 (0) since 
x e Rn\B 1 (0). From the expression of $(y - x), we see that
|x|2-n$(|x|(y - x))
is harmonic in B 1 (0). Moreover, for y e dB 1 (0),
(|x||y - £|)2 = |x|2(|y|2 - 2—x + -12)
|x |2 
|x |2
= |x i2 - 2y • x + 1 = |x - y |2.
Hence, on dB 1 (0),
(|x||y - x|)-(n-2) = |x - y|-(n-2)

238 CHAPTER 8
The fundamental solution and Green’s representation
Consequently,
f(x,y) = Q(x,y), 
on dBi(0).
Therefore
G(x, y) = $(x, y) - $(|x|(y - X)), 
x,y e Bi(0),x = y.
As an application, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 8.3.3. Let g(x} e C(dBr(0)). Let u(x) be the solution of the following 
Poisson problem:
- Au = f(x), x e Br(0),
u(x) = g(x), x e dBr(0).
Then,
r2 — |x|2 C g(y) 
C
u(x) = — n^(n)r

d^ + Jb (o) f^^ y^’

Proof We first calculate Gv(x, y) on dB 1 (0).

xi - yi + -1 yi |x|2 - xi
nrn(n) |x - y|n 
nrn(n) (|x - y|)n
Here at the final step, we have used the fact |x ||y - x| = |x - y | on dB 1 (0).
Note that on dB 1 (0), the outward normal v = y. Hence,

If we set u* (x) = u(rx), then we immediately obtain the formula. 
□
In the next subsection we will introduce a different method to find a Green’s 
function for the rectangular domain
= R = {(x,y): 0 < x < L, 0 < y < H}.

8.3 Green’s functions for the Laplace operator 239
8.3.4 Green’s functions via eigenfunctions
In this subsection we introduce a new method to construct a Green’s function based 
on eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.
Let p(x) e C1 (Q) and p(x) > p0 > 0 on 
for some p0 > 0. and q(x) e LTO(Q).
For any f(x) e L2(Q), consider the following problem:
L[u] :=—V[p(x)Vu]+ q(x)u = f(x), x e ^, 
(8.3.13)
B[u]:= 0, 
x e dti, 
(8.3.14) 
where the boundary operator
B [ u ] = u or B [ u ] = V vu.
We can define a fundamental solution as well as a Green’s function for the operator 
L in Rn associated with the operator B.
Let G(x, y) be the Green’s function associated with the operators L and B in . 
Then,
u(x) = J G(x,y)f(y)dy, x e Q.
Consider the eigenvalue problem:
L[$]= X$, 
x e ^, 
(8.3.15)
B[$] = 0, 
x e dti. 
(8.3.16)
Suppose M = {kn}^=1 are all eigenvalues and N = {^n(x)}n<=1 are all orthogonal 
eigenfunctions (which forms a basis for L2(^)).
If u(x) is a solution of the problem (8.3.13)-(8.3.14), then we can express u(x) 
as a series solution:
TO
u(x) 
Z2 anQn(x'),
n=1
x e ^.
It follows that
TOTO
L [ u ] = £ anL [ ^n ] = £ ankn^n.
On the other hand, f (x) can be expressed as a series of eigenfunctions:
TO
f (x) ^2 bn^n(x), 
n=1

where

(8.3.15)-(8.3.16) are given by
{kn}nTO=1,
{ tn } TO=1.

8.3 Green’s functions for the Laplace operator 241
8.3.5 Generalized Green’s function for the Laplace operator
We have seen in the previous subsection that there is no Green’s function if X = 0 
is one of the eigenvalues for the eigenvalue problem (8.3.15)-(8.3.16). However, we 
may modify the definition to define a generalized Green’s function when there exists 
an eigenvalue that is equal to 0.
Suppose there exists an eigenvalue Xm = 0 for some m. Let Nm := {$m (x)} be the 
corresponding subspace of eigenfunctions corresponding to Xm . Then, by the Fred­
holm Alternative, the problem (8.3.13)-(8.3.14) has a unique solution if and only if 
the nonhomogeneous term f(x) satisfies
<f,$m> = 0, 
V^m e Nm.
To illustrate the basic idea, we assume dimNm = 1.
Suppose G(x, y) is the Green’s function associated with operators L and B:
- LyG(x,y) = 8(x - y), 
x,y e Q,x = y,
vvG(x,y) = 0, 
y e dQ.
If Xm is an eigenvalue and $m e Nm is the corresponding eigenfunction for the opera­
tor L associated with the boundary operator B, then the Fredholm Alternative implies
0 = <8(x - y),^m(y)> =J 8(x - y)$m(y)dy = fim(x), 
Vx e Q, 
which is a contradiction.
To overcome the issue we introduce a forcing term c(x)$m (y) to replace 8(x - y), 
where c(x) will be chosen later. Then, the Fredholm Alternative implies
0 = <8(x - y) + c(x)<pm(y),<pm(y) > = <pm(x) + c(x) j Qmdy.
It follows that
c(x) =- fim(x) 
ki<mm dy'
This leads to the following definition.
Definition 8.3.2. Let Xm = 0 be an eigenvalue of the problem (8.3.15)-(8.3.16) and 
^m(x') be the corresponding eigenfunction. Then, the solution of the following prob­
lem
- LyG(x,y) = 8(x - y) - fim (x)^m(y) 
ki(mmddy ,
x, y e Q,x = y,
vvG(x,y) = 0, 
y e dQ, 
is called a generalized Green’s function for the operator L subject to the Neumann 
boundary operator B.

242 CHAPTER 8 The fundamental solution and Green’s representation
With the modified Green’s function, we can have a similar representation. Con­
sider the problem
- L[u] = f(x), 
x e Q,
(8.3.17)
Vvu(x) = 0, 
x e d&.
(8.3.18)
Theorem 8.3.5. Let Gm(x, y) be a generalized Green’s function associated with the 
operator L subject to the boundary condition VvG = 0. Then, the solution u(x) of 
problem (8.3.17)-(8.3.18) can be expressed in terms of a Green’s function:
u(x) = ( f(y)Gm(x,y)dy + ^mix) [ u(y)fm(y)dy, 
| |
where fm(x) is the eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue 7m = 0.

We consider the Laplace operator subject to the Neumann boundary condition:
— Au = f(x), x e ^,

— = g(x), x e d&.

(8.3.19)

We know 7 1 = 0 is an eigenvalue and we choose f 1 (x) = ^= as the correspond­

(b) The solution of the problem (8.3.19)-(8.3.20) is equal to

where

8.4 The fundamental solution of the heat equation
In this section we will derive the fundamental solution for the heat operator. Some 
elementary properties are also deduced. With the help of the fundamental solution we 
derive the explicit solution representation for the Cauchy problem associated with the 
heat operator.

244 CHAPTER 8 The fundamental solution and Green’s representation
8.4.1 The definition of the fundamental solution
Let f(x,t) e L1 (Rn x R + ^|L2(Rn x R +), g(x) e L2(Rn). Consider a Cauchy 
problem for the heat equation in Rn x R +:
I ^(x,t)dx < ^, 
Vt e R +.
Rn
Hence, $(x, t) needs a more complicated form.
Now, we use the method of separation of variables to seek a solution in the fol­
lowing form:
ut - Au = f(x,t), 
(x,t) e Rn x R +, 
(8.4.1)
u(x,0) = g(x), 
x e Rn. 
(8.4.2)
We are seeking an explicit solution representation.
Similar to the Laplace equation, naturally for any (y, t) we need to find a function 
that satisfies
$t - Ax$ = 8(x - y,t - t), 
(x,t) = (y,T),
where 8(x — y,t — t) is the Dirac-delta function with
f f 8(x — y,t — T)f(y,T)dydT = f(x,t), Vf(x,t) e C(Rn x R +).
0 Rn
Definition 8.4.1. The solution of the following heat equation
$t — Ax$ = 8(x — y,t — t), x,y e Rn,t>x, 
(8.4.3)
and
$(x — y, t — t) = 0, t < t, y $(x — y, t — t)dy = 1,
is called a fundamental solution for the heat equation.
Obviously, the fundamental solution $(x, t) is singular at (x, t) = (0, 0). To find 
the fundamental solution, we note that if u(x, t) is a solution of the heat equation, 
then for any real number X, u(kx, X21) is also a solution. This motivates us to find an 
explicit solution by choosing X = ~1=t to eliminate the variable t. Moreover, we seek 
the solution that is radially symmetric with respect to the space variables. This leads 
us to set
$(x,t) = v(y), 
(x,t) e Rn x R +,
where y = |x|-.
However, it will be seen that v(y) does not satisfy the following condition:
$(x, t) = w(t)v(y),
(x, t) e Rn x R+1 .

8.4 The fundamental solution of the heat equation 245
Then, the heat equation for $ is equivalent to
tw'v — 2nwv' — wy[4v" + v' | = 0, 
(x, t) e Rn x R +.
Consequently, we obtain
tw'(t) 
2 nv' (y) + y [4 v " (y) + v' (y) ] 
;
== k, 
w(t) 
v
where k is an unknown constant.
It follows that the general solution for w(t) is equal to
w(t) = ctk, 
t>0.
It is difficult to find v(y) for any constant k. However, if we choose k = — n, we have 
n
2 nv ' (y) + y [4 v (y) + v ' (y) ] = — 2 v(y).
We can rewrite the equation in the following form:
n , 1 
1 n ,
(y 2 v')' + 4 (y 2 v) ' = 0,
which implies
n . 
1
y2 [v (y) + 4 v(y)] = constant.
The above constant must be equal to 0 if we require that v(y), v'(y) ^ 0 as y ^ to.
It follows that
v(y) = e - 4.
Therefore the fundamental solution has the following form:
C _ Ix I2 
®(x,t) = -e- 4^.

We choose c such that
I $(x, t)dy = 1.

It follows that

For convenience, we often extend the fundamental solution to (—to, 0) by setting
$(x — y, t — t) = 0, 
Vt < t.

8.4.2 Some properties of the fundamental solution
From the expression of $(x, t), we know that $(x, t) is analytic with respect to x 
and smooth with respect to t if t>0.
Property 8.4.1. The fundamental solution $(x — y,t — t) is symmetric with respect 
to (x, t) and (y, t):
$(x — y,t — t) = $(y — x, t — t).
Proof. This is clear from the explicit expression.

where C depends only on n and ^.

To prove (b), we note that f (x, t) is Holder continuous in QT, then
| f (x, t) - f(y, t) | < C [| x - y |a + | t - t 12 ], Vx, y, e R",t,r e [0 ,T ].
It follows that

Since both functions on the right-hand side of the above inequalities (8.4.4)­
(8.4.5) are integrable in QT, we see the desired derivatives are justified. 
□
8.4.3 The Cauchy problem for the heat equation
In this subsection we will derive the solution representation for the Cauchy problem 
in terms of the fundamental solution. The main challenge is that the fundamental 
solution $(x - y, t - t) is singular at the point (y, t). However, the difficulty can be 
overcame by using some similar ideas to the case when we deal with the fundamental 
solution associated with the Laplace operator.
H(8.4.1)

(b) Let g(x) e Ll2oc(Rn) and
|g(x)| < Ceh|x|2,
where

Consider the following Cauchy problem in QT:
ut - ku = f(x, t),
(x, t) e QT,
(8.4.6)

248 CHAPTER 8 The fundamental solution and Green’s representation
u(x, 0) = g(x), 
x e Rn. 
(8.4.7)
Theorem 8.4.3. Under the assumption H(8.4.1), the Cauchy problem (8.4.6)-(8.4.7) 
has a unique solution
u(x, t) e L2((0,T); H2(Rn)) Q C([0,T]; L2(Rn)),
which can be expressed by
u(x,t) = j &(x,y,t, 0)g(y)dy + j j &(y - x,t - T)f(y,T)dydT.
Moreover, if f(x, t) e C^ (QT), then
u(x,t) e C2+a 1+2(Rn x (0, m)).
Proof. Let
u 1 (x,t) = 
$(x,y,t, 0 )g(y)dy

u2(x,t) = 
$(y - x,t - T)f(y,T)dydT

For t>0, u1(x, t) is differentiable with respect to x and t. Moreover,
u 11 - Au 1 = y [$t - A$(x,t,y, 0)]g(y)dy = 0.
Furthermore, since g(x) e L2 (Rn),
lim ||u 1 (x,t) - g(x)||L2(Rn = lim |U $(x,y,t, 0)(g(y) - g(x))dy||L2.Rn-.

By Theorem 8.4.2, we have

It follows that
[ y* [$t - Ax$] f(y,r)dx = j y* 8(x - y,t - r)f(y,r)dydr = f(x,t).
However, since $(x - y, t - t) is singular at (x, t), we need to take away a small 
parabolic cylinder from Rn x R 1. Let r > 0 be small and Qr(x, t) = Br(x) x (t - 
r2,t]. Moreover, we first assume that f (x, t) is smooth with a compact support in 
Rn x R 1. Then,
u21 - Au2 = y y $(y,r)[(d - Ax)f(x - y,t - r)dydr

Clearly, since $(y, s) is a fundamental solution, we see that
J1 = y ^(y,e)f(x - y,t - e)dy -J $(x - y,t)f(x - y, 0 )dy.
Also,
| J21<[|| ft ||0 +11 Af ||0] e ^ 0, 
as e ^ 0.
It follows that
u21 - Au2 = f (x, t),
(x,t) e Rn x R 1.

250 CHAPTER 8 The fundamental solution and Green’s representation
When f(x, t) e L0(Rn x R +) P|C“,2 (Q), we use a smooth approximation fn(x, t) 
e C0 (Rn x R +) to obtain
Un(x,t) = j $(x,y,t, 0)g(y)dy + j j $(y - x,t - T)fn(y,t)dydt.
Now, for any T>0,
II un || L 0 (Rn x R +) — II g IIL 0 (Rn) + T || f || L 0 (Rn x R+).
Similarly, we see un(x, t) is locally Holder continuous and
II un || c“’2 (Rn x (0 ,T ]) - C.
By the compactness theorem and the regularity theory ([8,21]), we see that u(x, t) 
satisfies
u(x,t) = j ®(x,y,t, 0)g(y)dy + j &(y - x,t - T)f(y,T)dydT.
From Theorem 8.4.2, we see that
u(x, t) e C2+a' 1+2 (Rn x (0, 0))
and it satisfies Eq. (8.4.6)-(8.4.7). The uniqueness follows from the maximum prin­
ciple that will be proved in the next theorem. 
□
8.4.4 The maximum principle for the Cauchy problem
In this subsection we prove a maximum principle for the Cauchy problem. Unlike 
the maximum principle for a bounded domain, we need a condition that controls 
the growth of the solution as |x | ^ 0. Roughly speaking, we should require that a 
solution u(x, t) grows at most like eCIxI2 for some constant C>0.
Theorem 8.4.4. (The maximum principle for the Cauchy problem) Let u(x, t) e 
C2,1(QT) C(Rn x [0,T)) satisfy
ut - Au > 0, 
(x,t) e Qt,
u(x, 0) > 0.
Moreover, there exists a constant z>0 such that
^lim infbr(0)x[0,T]u(x,t)eaR > 0. 
(8.4.8)
Then,
u(x, t) > 0,
(x,t)e QT.

8.4 The fundamental solution of the heat equation 251
Proof. We choose f > a and set T1 = -f. Introduce an auxiliary function
n f | x |2 
v(x,t) = (1 - 4 ft) - 2 e( !—4 f‘).
Then, a direct calculation shows that
vt - ^v = 0, 
(x,t) € QT1.
For any e > 0, set
w(x, t) = u(x, t) + ev(x, t).
Then,
wt — Aw > 0, 
w(x, 0) > 0,
Moreover, by the assumption,
lim infBR(0)w(x, t) > 0,

uniformly for t €[0, T].
For any fixed point (x0, t0) € QT1 and any small constant a>0, we can choose R 
sufficiently large such that
w(x, t) > — a, 
V| x | > R, t € [0 ,T1 ].
On Qr = Br(0) x (0,T1], V(x,t) := w(x,t) + a satisfies
Vt — AV > 0,
V(x,t)>0,
V(x,0)>0,
(x,t) € QR,
(x,t) € dBR(0) x (0,T1],

We use the maximum principle in a bounded domain to obtain
V(x,t)>0, 
(x,t)€QR.
Therefore
w(x0 , t0 ) > —a.
Since a can be arbitrarily small and (x0, t0) € QT1 is arbitrary, we conclude u(x, t) > 
0in QT1 . We can continue this process to obtain the nonnegativity of u(x , t) in the 
interval [T1 ,T1 + 8f ]. After a finite number of steps, we see that
u(x, t) > 0,
(x,t)€ Rn x[0,T].
□

252 CHAPTER 8 The fundamental solution and Green’s representation
A direct consequence of Theorem 8.2.1 is that the solution of the Cauchy problem 
(8.4.1)-(8.4.2) is unique for a small T > 0 if for any large R > 0,
|u(x,t)|< Cea 1 x|2, 
V|x|> R,
where C and a are independent of R but depend on T.
Another consequence of Theorem 8.4.4 is that the propagation speed of the heat 
conduction is infinite.
Corollary 8.4.1. Let g(x) e C(R1) and f(x, t) > 0 on Rn x R + be nonnegative and 
g(x) = 0 on R1. Then, the solution u(x, t) of the Cauchy problem must be positive:
u(x,t)> 0, V(x,t) e Q. □
Corollary 8.4.2. (The maximum norm estimate) Let g(x) e L™(Rn) and f(x, t) e 
L “ (Q). Then, the solution u(x, t) of the Cauchy problem (8.4.6)-(8.4.7) must have 
the following estimate:
supu(x,t) < C(T)[||g||l~(R^ + ||f ||l~(Q)], 
V(x,t) e Q. □
QT
Remark 8.4.1. The growth condition (8.4.8) is optimal for the uniqueness of the 
Cauchy problem (8.4.6)-(8.4.7). One can construct a counterexample that there exists 
an infinite number of solutions u(x, t) for the Cauchy problem if
n
|u(y, t)|e-K|y| + dydT < ^

for any > > 0.
8.5 Green’s function of the heat equation
In this section we define a Green’s function associated with the heat equation. The 
basic goal is to find the explicit solution representation for the heat equation in a gen­
eral domain. Many ideas are parallel to the case associated with the Laplace equation 
in a general domain.
8.5.1 The definition of a Green’s function
We have seen in Section 8.4 that a Green’s function for the Laplace operator in a 
bounded domain is constructed from the fundamental solution, except with zero value 
on the boundary. It is natural to define a Green’s function associated with the heat 
operator as follows.
Let be a domain in Rn and QT = x (0 ,T ]. For any t e (0 ,T ], Let Qt(t) = 
x (t, T].

8.5 Green’s function of the heat equation 253
Definition 8.5.1. We call G(x — y,t — t) a Green’s function for the heat operator 
associated with a Dirichlet boundary condition, if for any function f(x) e L2(Q),
Gt — &xG = 8(x — y,t — t), 
(x,t) e Qt(t), 
(8.5.1)
G(x — y,t — t) = 0, 
(x,t) e dQ x (t,T], 
(8.5.2)
tim+"/aG( — y,t— T)f (y)dy — f II l 2 (q) = 0 •
(8.5.3)
To construct a Green’s function, we only need to use the fundamental solution $ 
with a correction term, denoted by ^(x — y,t — t), which satisfies the heat equation 
with the boundary value $. For any fixed y e , t e [0,T), we consider
^t — 
= 0, x e Q,T<t<T, 
(8.5.4)
ty(x — y,t — t) = $(x — y, t — t), x e dQ, t < t < T, (8.5.5)
^(x — y, 0) = 0, x e Q x{t = t}. 
(8.5.6)
The existence of ^(x — y,t — t) is known, since $(x — y, t — t) is smooth on 
d& for t > t . Then, by definition,
G(x — y,t — t) = $(x — y, t — t) — ^(x — y, t — t)
is the Green’s function for the heat equation associated with the Dirichlet boundary 
condition.
8.5.2 Green’s representation
From the definition of the Green’s function, we have the following elementary prop­
erties.
Property 8.5.1. Let G(x — y, t — T) be the Green’s function for the heat operator 
associated with a Dirichlet boundary condition. Then,
(a) G(x — y, t — T) = G(y — x, t — T).
(b)
C 
I x—y |2
0 <G(x — y,t — t) < (t — T)n/2 e 4(t—T), 
Vx,y e QtJ>t.
Consider the following problem:
ut — Au = f(x,t), 
(x,t) e Qt, 
(8.5.7)
u(x,t) = 0, 
(x,t) e dQ x (0,T], 
(8.5.8)
u(x, 0) = g(x), x e Q. 
(8.5.9)
From the construction of the Green’s function, we have the following theorem.

254 CHAPTER 8 The fundamental solution and Green’s representation
Theorem 8.5.1. Let f(x, t) be L2(QT) andg(x) e L2(Q). Then, the solution u(x, t) 
of Eq. (8.5.7)-(8.5.9) can be expressed by
u(x,t) = j G(x - y,t)g(y)dy + j j G(x - y,t - r)f(y,T)dydr.
Moreover,
(a) if f(x, t) e Ca,a (QT) for some a e (0, 1), then u(x, t) e C2+a,1+ 2 (QT);
(b) if f(x,t) e ('a~ (QT) and g(x) e Ca(Q), then u(x,t) e C2+a, 1+ 2 (QT).
Proof. The argument is similar to the case for the Laplace operator. G(y - x,r -t) 
has a singular point (x, t). For the definition of the heat operator, we have
u(x,t) = 
u(y,r)8(y - x,T - t)dydT
0 Q
= u(y, t)[GT(y - x,T - t) - AyG(y - x,T - t)]dydT 
Jo Ja
= j G(y,t)g(y)dy + j j [u - AyU]G(y - x,T - t)dydr
= G(y - x, t)g(y)dy + f(y, t)G(y - x, t - t)dydt.
This formula is the same as what we derived in Chapter 7 by using the Fourier 
transform. The regularity results are based on the estimates for the fundamental solu­
tion $. We omit the proof. The reader may find the detailed proof in [9,19,21]. □
8.5.3 Green’s functions for some special domains
Similar to the Laplace equation, the method of a mirror-image reflection is an effec­
tive way to construct a Green’s function. We give a few examples here.
Example 8.5 .1. Find the Green’s function for the heat operator in the half-space:
= R + := {x = (x 1 ,x2, ■■■ ,xn) e Rn,xn > 0}.
Solution. For y = (y 1 ,y 2, ■ ■■ ,yn) e R+, we define
y = (y 1 ,y2, ■■■, -yn).
Then, by using the symmetry we see that the Green’s function in R + x (0,T] is 
equal to
G(x — y, t — t ) 
$(x — y, t — t) — $(x — y), t — t ).
In particular, in one-space dimension we have
G(x - y, t - t)=
1
V4 n(t — t)
( 
(x - y)2
e 
4(t- t)
(x+y)2
4 (t - t) .

8.6 Finite-time blowup and extinction 255
Example 8.5 .2. Find the Green’s function for the heat operator in the domain = 
{x e R1 : 0 <x<L}, where L>0.
Solution. To satisfy the boundary condition x = 0, we use the reflection method to 
have
G1 (x - y,t - t) :=
1
V4 n(t — t)
( (x -y)2 
e 4(t—t)
(x+y)2
4 (t—t) 
.
e
However, G1 does not satisfy the boundary condition at x = L, so we begin with G1 
and subtract a new function such that G1 = 0aty = L:
G2(x — y, t — t) := G1 (x + L — y, t — t) — G1 (x — y, t — t).
G2 satisfies the heat equation and the boundary value at y = L. However, G2 does not 
satisfy the boundary condition at y = 0. We begin with G2 and use the mirror-image 
reflection to obtain G3 (x — y, t — t). Then, we continue this process to obtain
TO 
TO
G(x — y,t — t) = ^2 $(x + mL - y, t - t) — 
$(x + mL + y, t — t).
m=—TO 
m=—TO
Justification of the convergence for the above series relies on the exponential decay 
property from the fundamental solution. One can extend the method into a rectangle 
in n-space dimension.
8.6 Finite-time blowup and extinction
In this section we study a semilinear heat equation to demonstrate some phenomena 
that are quite different from a linear problem. We will show that the solution may 
blow up in finite time when a nonlinear source f(s) grows fast enough as long as the 
initial datum satisfies certain conditions. On the other hand, we show that the solution 
may become zero in finite time if f(s) sinks fast enough.
8.6.1 Finite-time blowup in a bounded domain
Let be a bounded domain in Rn and Q = x (0, to ) .To ensure the existence of a 
solution in a short time, we assume the following conditions.
H(6.1) Let f(s) be a locally Lipschitz continuous function on [0, TO).
H(6.2) Let g(x) e LTO(Q).
Consider the following semilinear problem:
ut — Au = f(u), 
(x,t) e Q, 
(8.6.1)
u(x,t) = 0, 
(x,t) e dQ x (0, to), 
(8.6.2)
u(x, 0) = g(x), x e ^. 
(8.6.3)

256 CHAPTER 8 The fundamental solution and Green’s representation
Our goal is to find sufficient conditions on f(s) such that the problem (8.6.1)­
(8.6.3) has a solution in Q or the solution blows up (unbounded in Lp(&) for some 
p > 1) in finite time. We first prove a local existence result.
Lemma 8.6.1. Let the assumptions H(6.1)-H(6.2) hold. Then, there exists a maximal 
time T* e (0, —) such that the problem (8.6.1)-(8.6.3) has a unique solution in QT*.
Moreover, if T* < —, then
lim max ||u||l-(a) = —.
T ^ T *-0< t < T
Proof. We use the contraction mapping principle to prove the result. Choose V = 
L-(Qt) for some T > 0. Set K0 = 1 + ||g||l-(□) and
L(K0):=max{L:|f(s1)-f(s2)|<L|s1-s2|,0<s1,s2<K0}.
For any v(x, t) e V, we define a mapping M : V ^ V with M[v] = u(x, t), where 
u(x , t ) is the solution to the following linear problem:
ut - Au = f(v), 
(x,t) e Qt, 
(8.6.4)
u(x,t) = 0, 
(x,t) e dQ x (0,T], 
(8.6.5)
u(x, 0) = g(x), x e ^. 
(8.6.6)
Clearly, the mapping M is well defined, since the linear problem (8.6.4)-(8.6.6) has
a unique solution.
Since g(x) e L—(Q), we see from the Green’s representation that
||u||l-(Q) < ||g||l-(Q) + [|f(0)| + L(K0)|Q|]t < K0, 
t e [0,T5],
provided that T0 < । f( 0) |+L (K0) । a ।.
By using Green’s representation, we see that
|| M [ V1] - M [ V 2]|| L - (Q) < L(K 0 )t || V1 - V 2|| L - (Q), 
t e (0 ,T0 ].
Therefore if we choose T1 with T1 < 1 min{T0, LK0)}, then the mapping M is a 
contraction mapping from V into V. The contraction-mapping principle implies that 
the mapping M has a unique fixed point. This fixed point of the mapping M is the 
unique solution of the semilinear problem (8.6.1)-(8.6.3). Define
g 1 (x) = u(x, T1), 
x e ^.
We can consider the problem (8.6.1)-(8.6.3) in x [ Ti ,T ] with a new initial value 
g1(x) to obtain a local solution on [T1, T2]. As long as u(x, T2) is bounded, we can 
repeat the process to obtain a local solution for the problem (8.6.1)-(8.6.3) over x

Next, we show that the local solution u(x, t) will blow up in finite time if f(s) 
grows fast enough. From now on we assume that g(x) > 0 and f(0) > 0. The maxi­
mum principle implies that
u(x,t) > 0, 
V(x, t) e Q.
Theorem 8.6 .1. Let f(s) be monotone increasing and convex on [a, to) for some 
large a>0. Moreover, f(s) satisfies

Then, the solution u(x,t) of the problem (8.6.1)-(8.6.3) blows up infinite time as

is suitably large, where f(x ) is the principal eigenfunction corresponding to the first 
eigenvalue of the Laplace operator associated with a Dirichlet boundary condition.
Namely, there exists a constant T* > 0 such that

Proof. Let f(x') be the eigenfunction corresponding to the first eigenvalue X 1 for the 
Laplace equation associated with a Dirichlet boundary condition. We further choose 
f(x) > 0 such that
f(x)dx = 1.

Define
y(t) = j u(x,t)f(x)dx.
Since f(s) is convex, by Jensen’s inequality we have
f f(u)f(x)dx > f(y(t)), t > 0.
It follows from Eq. (8.6.1) that
y'(t) + X1 y(t) > f(y(t)), t > 0.

A classical example for Theorem 8.6.1 is that
f(u) = |u|p 1 u, 
p e (0, rc>).
The solution to the problem (8.6.1)-(8.6.3) blows up in finite time if p > 1 and the 
initial datum is suitably large, while the solution exists globally if p e[0, 1]. An 
interesting observation is that the size condition for the initial datum is necessary.
Corollary 8.6.1. Let f(s) = sp with p > 1. Then, the problem (8.6.1)-(8.6.3) has a 
global solution if g(x) is sufficiently small.
Proof. Let n > 2. Set
f(x,t) = S(t + 1 )$(x,t + 1), x e Rn,t > 0,
where S is a positive constant to be chosen later.

Let u(x, t) be the solution of problem (8.6.1)-(8.6.3) in QT *. Define 
w(x, t) = f(x, t) - u(x, t), 
V(x, t) e QT*.
Then, w(x, t) satisfies
wt - Aw = f'(0(x, t))w,
(x,t) e QT*,

8.6 Finite-time blowup and extinction 259
w(x,t) > 0, 
(x,t) e dpQT*,
where 0(x, t) is the mean value between $(x,t) and u(x,t). 
The maximum principle implies that
0 < u(x, t) < $(x, t),
V(x,t) e Qt*.
Note that $(x, t) is uniformly bounded for all t e [0, to). Therefore u(x, t) has a 
global upper bound, which implies T* = to. 
□
If the Dirichlet boundary condition (8.6.2) is replaced by a Neumann type, a very 
different situation occurs. From the physical point of view, it is expected that the 
solution will blow up in finite time for any initial datum since there is no heat loss 
across the boundary.
Theorem 8.6 .2. Let f(s) be monotone increasing and convex on [a, to) for some 
large a>0. Moreover, f(s) satisfies

Then, the solution u(x, t) of the problem (8.6.1), (8.6.3) along with the Neumann

Proof. The idea is the same as for Theorem 8.6.1. Define
y(t) = W\ fa u(x, t)dx > 0.
Then, integrating Eq. (8.6.1) over and using Jensen’s inequality, we obtain
y'(t) =

If
g(x) > 0, g(x)dx > 0, 
then the solution u(x, t) to the problem (8.6.8)-(8.6.10) must blow up infinite time.
We leave the proof as an exercise. A much more detailed analysis can be found in 
[18].
8.6.2 Finite-time blow up in Rn
There is a very interesting result for the heat equation (8.6.1) when is replaced by 
the whole space Rn. Let p e (1, rc>) and Q = Rn x R +. Consider
ut -&u = up, 
(x,t) e Q, 
(8.6.11)
u(x,0) = g(x) >0, xeRn. 
(8.6.12)
We always assume that g(x) e L1(Q) is nonnegative and
G0 := g(x)d x > 0.
Rn
Then, the problem (8.6.11)-(8.6.12) has a nonnegative solution in QT for some 
T>0. Moreover, we know that the solution will blow up in finite time if g(x) is 
suitably large.
Define
p 0 = 1 + -. 
n
p0 is called Fujita’s critical number (see [11]).
Theorem 8.6.4. Let G0 > 0. Then,
(a) There exists a solution to the problem (8.6.11 )-(8.6.12) globally if p > p0 and 
g(x) is sufficiently small.
(b) Every solution to the problem (8.6.11)-(8.6.12) will blow up infinite time if 
1 < p < p 0.
Proof. By the solution representation, we have
u(x,t) = j $(x - y,t - T)g(y)dy + j j $(x - y,t - T)up(y,T)dydT

8.6 Finite-time blowup and extinction 261
:= u1(x, t) + u2(x, t).
To prove (a), we construct an upper solution that is global in time. Let e > 0 be small. 
Define
ty(x,t) = etn^(x,t), t > 1.
A direct computation shows that
tyt — A^ — <pp = entn-1 $(x, t) — eptnp^(x, t)p2p

It follows that
u(x, t) < ty(x,t + 1),
V(x, t) e Q.
Now, if g(x) < ty(x, 1), we use the maximum principle to obtain
u(x, t) < ty(x,t + 1),
V(x, t) e Q.
Thus u(x, t) is uniformly bounded in Q. Hence, u(x, t) must exist globally.
To prove (b), we assume that the solution u(x, t) exists for all t > 0.
For any fixed 5>0, a direct calculation shows that the fundamental solution

8.6 Finite-time blowup and extinction 263
For the critical case p = p0 = 1 + 2, we show that u(x, t) will become sufficiently 
large if t is large. Indeed, first, since g(x) > 0,
I <b(x - y,t)g(y)dy> 0,
Rn
we may assume that there exists a small constant c0 > 0 such that
g(x) > c0, x G B1 (0).

If we choose t0 sufficiently large and use u(x, t0) as an initial value, then y(t0) 
will be sufficiently large. Consequently, since p> 1,
^y(t 0)1—p — 1 < 0,
which implies that y(t) blows up in finite time.
□
8.6.3 Finite-time extinction and dead core
In this subsection we investigate a different phenomenon in which a nonnegative 
solution of (8.6.1)-(8.6.3) becomes zero in the whole domain (called extinction) in 
finite time. Namely, when a cooling process in the domain is fast enough, then it

264 CHAPTER 8 The fundamental solution and Green’s representation
will become the extinction in finite time. Let Q = x (0, rc>) where c Rn with a
smooth boundary.
H(6.3) Let g(x) e L2(Q) be nonnegative. Let f(s) e C1 (0, rc>), f(0) = 0 and 
f (s) < 0 be monotone decreasing on [0, rc>) and
sup f^ < -a, 
s >0 sp
where p e (0, 1) and a>0.
A typical example is that
f(u)=-up, 
pe (0, 1).
With the assumption H(6.3), the comparison principle yields that
0 < u(x,t) <||g||L~(Q), 
(x,t) e Q.
It follows that the problem (8.6.1)-(8.6.3) has a global solution in Q.
Theorem 8.6.5. Let H(6.3) hold. Then, there exists a time T such that the solution 
(8.6.1 )-(8.6.3) will become zero in x (T, rc>).
Proof. By the assumption for f, we see that f(u) < -aup for u > 0. Define
y(t) := - y u(x,t)2dx, 
t > 0.
Then, we use Eq. (8.6.1) and the condition for f(s) to obtain
y'(t) + ay(t)fi < 0,
where fi = 1+2p.
It follows that
^-y[y(t) 1—fi — y(0) 1—fi] +1 < 0.
1-fi
Since fi < 1 and y(t) > 0, we see y(t) must be equal to 0 at a finite time T. 
□
A typical example for the extinction phenomenon is that
f(u)=—up, 
pe (0, 1).
Corollary 8.6.2. Let h(x,t) e L“(9Q x (0, ^)) be nonnegative. Suppose the 
boundary condition (8.6.2) is replaced by
u(x, t) = h(x, t),
(x,t) e dQ x (0, ^).
(8.6.13)

8.7 Notes and remarks 265
Then, there exists a subregion Q(t) c Q x (T, to) for some T > 0 such that 
u(x,t) = 0, 
(x,t) G Q(t).
Proof. Let
H0 := II h IIL to (9Q) x (0, to ) + II g IIL to (Q).
Let w(x, t) be the solution of the following auxiliary problem:
Wt - Aw = f(w), 
(x,t) G Q,
w(x,t) = H0, 
(x,t) g dti x (0, to),
w(x,t) = g(x), x G Q.
The comparison theorem implies that
0 < u(x, t) < w(x, t), 
(x, t) g Q.
Note that w(x, t) attains a maximum at every lateral point d& x (0, to), Hopf’s 
Lemma implies that
dw(x, t)
—> 0, 
(x, t) g d^ x (0, to).

The rest of the proof follows the same steps as in the proof of Theorem 8.6.5. 
□
Corollary 8.6.2 shows that the chemical concentration will become zero as long 
as there exists a strong absorption even if the concentration on the boundary is very 
large. The subregion Q(t) is called a dead core in the literature.
8.7 Notes and remarks
The fundamental solution for a differential operator plays an important role in ad­
vanced analysis. Many interesting results such as DiGiorgi-Nash’s estimate for ellip­
tic and parabolic equations are derived from these fundamental solutions. Schauder’s 
estimate for a general elliptic and parabolic equation can be established via various 
estimates for the fundamental solution ([9,12,19,21,32,34]). We focused only on the 
Laplace and the heat operators to illustrate the basic ideas. Green’s function is an 
interesting topic that can be used to deduce many properties of the solution for the 
Laplace and the heat equations. The boundary-element method in numerical analysis 
is based on Green’s functions, which is an important topic in advanced PDEs ([9,21]).
The materials in Sections 8.1-8.5 are fairly straightforward. Section 8.6 is an 
advanced topic that is usually not covered in the elementary PDEs. Blowup and ex­
tinction in finite time for the solution of a semilinear heat equation are established. 
The interested readers may find much more material for topics in [14] and [15].

9.1 Some first-order PDE models in physical sciences
In this section we describe some physical models governed by systems of first-order 
PDEs. These models are derived by using several physical laws that are different from 
previous chapters.
9.1.1 The mathematical model of traffic flow and Hamilton-Jacobi 
equations
We begin with a simple model that describes the traffic flow in highways. Let p(x, t) 
represent the number of cars per unit distance at time t and location x. p(x,t) is often 
referred as the traffic density. Let q(x, t) represent the traffic flow that measures the 
number of cars per unit time passing at place x and time t .
If we consider an arbitrary section of the highway between x = a and x = b, then 
the total number of cars between x = a and x = b is equal to
* p(x, t)dx.
a
From the conservation of cars moving into the roadway at x = a and moving out at 
x = b, we have
d [b 
[b
p(x, t)dx = q(a, t) — q(b, t) = — 
qx(x, t)dx.
dt a 
a
It follows that
[ Pt + qx ] dx = 0. 
a
Since the interval [a,b] c R1 is arbitrary, we see that
Pt + qx = 0, 
x e R1 ,t > 0,
which is essentially the same as the continuity equation.

270 CHAPTER 9 Systems of first-order partial differential equations
On the other hand, the traffic flow q must be proportional to the car velocity, 
denoted by u .It is clear that the velocity u must depend on the density p. Therefore 
it is reasonable to assume that the car velocity u typically is a function of the density 
p . It follows that
q = q(x, t, p).
If there exist branch roads that merge to the main highway, one may add an additional 
number of cars as a source term, denoted by b. This leads to the following first-order 
partial differential equation:
pt + a(x, t, p)px = b(x,t, p), 
(9.1.1)
where a(x, t, p) and b(x, t, p) are known functions.
It is expected that one should be able to find the traffic density p(x, t) at any time 
if an initial density is known.
A more general class of the first-order nonlinear equation in Rn is given by
ut + H(x,t,ux 1, ■■■ ,uxn) = 0,
which is often called the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
9.1.2 The fundamental equations in fluid mechanics
Fluid dynamics is an important field in modern sciences and engineering fields. The 
fundamental equations in fluid mechanics are based on two conservation laws. The 
first one is called the continuity equation that is based on the conservation of mass. 
The second equation is called Euler’s equation for a compressible fluid or the Navier- 
Stokes equation for an incompressible fluid, which is based on the conservation of 
momentum (or Newton’s second law).
Consider a fluid occupying a region c R3. Let p(x, t) be the density of the 
fluid at location x e R3 and time t. Let V(x,t) be the velocity field of the fluid. 
Suppose the trajectory of a particle at location x and time t in the fluid is denoted by 
X(t) = < x 1 (t), x2(t), x3 (t) > for t > 0.
Let D be any subdomain of . Then, the change of total mass of the fluid in D 
must be equal to the total fluid flowing out through the boundary of D in the normal 
direction:
d , p(x,t)dx = — 
[pV • v(x)]ds,
dt D 
dD
where v(x) is the outward unit normal at x e dD.
Gauss’s divergence theorem implies that
[pt+div(pV)]dx=0,t>0.
D
Since D is arbitrary in , we find that

9.1 Some first-order PDE models in physical sciences 271
Pt + div(pV) = 0, x e &,t> 0, 
(9.1.2)
Eq. (9.1.2) is called the continuity equation that holds for all kinds of fluids. For an 
incompressible fluid with constant density such as water or crude oil, we see that
divV = 0.
Next, we derive an equation based on the conservation of momentum (or Newton’s 
second law). By definition, the velocity V is equal to
X'(t) = V(X(t),t), 
t > 0.
The acceleration of the fluid particle is equal to
X" (t) = dV + (V •v) V. 
dt
For any subdomain D c , the total momentum of the fluid over the domain D is 
equal to
P
D
— + (V •V) V 
dt
dx.
There are two types of forces acting on the fluid. The first one is the Kelvin force 
or potential force due to the pressure p(x, t). The other type of force is the external 
force such as the gravitational force and resistance force, denoted by F. Suppose we 
neglect the force due to the internal friction of fluid (viscosity). Therefore the total 
momentum produced by the Kelvin force and external force in D are equal to
— j pvds + y Fdx,
where v represents the outward unit normal on dD.
The divergence theorem implies that
pvds = 
(Vp)dx.
dD 
D
Since D is arbitrarily in , we obtain
P[Vt + (V •V)V] = —Vp + F.
(9.1.3)
Eq. (9.1.3) is called Euler’s equation.
For a fluid such as a gas, the pressure p is a function of density P . Therefore we 
obtain the fundamental equation for the gas dynamics:
Pt + div(pV) = 0, 
x e Q,t> 0, 
(9.1.4)

272 CHAPTER 9 Systems of first-order partial differential equations
For a fluid with viscosity, there is an additional internal force due to the friction 
(viscosity), which can be expressed by (see [10]):
jkV,
where j is referred to as the kinematic viscosity.
Hence, Euler’s equation becomes
p[Vt + (V •V)V] = jAV -Vp + F. 
(9.1.6)
For an incompressible fluid with a constant density, Eq. (9.1.6) along with the conti­
nuity equation (9.1.2) is called the Navier-Stokes equation.
9.1.3 Maxwell’s equations in electric and magnetic fields
Suppose that charged particles occupy a medium c R3. From the physical ex­
periments, we know that charged particles produce an electric field and a magnetic 
field in . Let the electric and magnetic densities be denoted by E(x, t) and H(x, t), 
respectively.
By using the conservation laws for current (similar to the continuity equation) and 
charged particles (similar to the conservation of energy) as well as experimental laws 
(Ampere’s and Faraday’s laws) and constitutive assumptions, we obtain the following 
Maxwell’s system (see a more detailed derivation in [36]):
s E t + a E = Vx H + J0, 
x e Q,t > 0, 
(9.1.7)
j H t + Vx E = M0, x e Q,t > 0, 
(9.1.8)
where J0 and M0 represent known electric and magnetic currents, respectively, gen­
erated from the external system, s and j are called the electric permittivity and 
magnetic permeability, respectively. Moreover, a is the electric conductivity.
With appropriate initial and boundary conditions, we obtain the mathematical 
model for the motion of electric and magnetic fields in a medium .
We know that an nth-order ODE can be expressed as a system of first-order 
ODEs. In principle, by introducing suitable new variables, many high-order PDEs 
can be written as a system of first-order PDEs. However, it will be seen that the well- 
posedness for a system of first-order PDEs is much harder to deal with in comparison 
to those classical second-order PDEs. It is worthy noting that for a first-order PDE or 
system how to impose a boundary condition is a complicated task. It turns out that a 
boundary condition depends on the characteristic curves for the system.
9.2 The characteristic method
In this section we study an initial-value problem for a single first-order partial differ­
ential equation. We will introduce the characteristic method to solve the traffic-flow 

9.2 The characteristic method 273
equation globally. The method is then extended to the transport model in higher space 
dimension.
9.2.1 The characteristic method with a single space variable
We begin with a linear traffic-flow equation. Let a(x, t) be a continuous function 
for all (x, t) e R1 x R + and b(x, t) e L“(R1 x R +). Moreover, a(x, t) is Lipschitz 
continuous with respect to x .
Consider the traffic-flow equation with an initial condition:
ut + a(x, t)ux = b(x, t), 
(x,t) e R1 x R+1 , 
(9.2.1)
u(x,0)=f(x), 
xe R1, 
(9.2.2)
where f(x)e C(R1).
Let x0 e R1 be a fixed point. Define a characteristic curve L : x = x(t) as follows:
dx
— = a(x,t), 
dt
t e R+1 ,
x(0) = x0,
x0 e R1.
(9.2.3)
(9.2.4)
From the theory of ODEs, there exists a unique global solution x = x(t) to 
Eq. (9.2.3)-(9.2.4) for t > 0. Moreover, since the tangent at every point of the char­
acteristic curve L is not equal to 0, the characteristic curve L is monotone increasing 
for t>0.
Now, along the characteristic curve L we define a function
U(t) := u(x(t), t), t > 0.
We use Eqs. (9.2.1) and (9.2.3) to find
dU(t) 
dt
= ut (x(t), t) + ux (x(t), t) dx(t) 
dt
= ut (x(t), t) + a(x(t), t)ux (x(t), t) 
= b(x(t), t).
It follows that
U(t) = U(0) + y b(x(r), r)dr = u(x0, 0) + j b(x(T),T)dT
= f(x0) + j b(x(T),T)dT,
i.e., the solution u(x, t) can be found explicitly along the characteristic curve L. This 
method is called the characteristic method.
We summarize the above analysis as the following theorem.

274 CHAPTER 9 Systems of first-order partial differential equations
Theorem 9.2.1. Let a(x,t) e C(R1 x R +) be Lipschitz continuous w.r.t. x and 
b(x, t) e L“ (R1 x R+). Then, for any f(x) e C(R1), the solution of the problem 
(9.2.1)-(9.2.2) is equal to
u(x(t),t) = f(x0) +j b(x(T),T)dT,
where x(t) is the characteristic curve obtained by the solution of the ODE:
dx
— = a(x,t), 
dt
x(0) = x0,
(x, t ) e R 1 x R+1 , 
x0 e R1.
Moreover, u(x, t) continuously depends on the known data. 
□
Let us take a look at a special case where a(x, t) = a is a constant. In this case, 
the characteristic curve L is a line x = at + x0, t > 0. We can easily see the solution 
u(x, t) along the line L:
u(x,t) = f(x — at) + j b(x — ar,t)dr, (x,t) e R1 x R +.
From the characteristic method, unlike the second-order PDE we may not be able 
to prescribe a boundary condition for a first-order PDE. It depends on whether or 
not a boundary point can be determined along the characteristic curve. We use the 
following example to illustrate the idea.
Example 9.2.1. Consider the following initial-boundary value problem:
ut + aux = 0, 
(x,t) e (0, <x>) x (0, <x>), 
(9.2.5)
u(0,t) = g(t), 
t > 0, 
(9.2.6)
u(x, 0) = f (x), xe R+1 , 
(9.2.7)
where a is a constant, f(x) and g(t) are given functions.
A characteristic curve L starting with x = x0 e R+1 is defined by
dx(t) 
------ = a,
dt
x(0) = xo, 
xo e [0, <x>).
It follows that every characteristic curve L : x = at + x0, which is a line starting with 
x0 and slope 1 on the xt-plane.
When a<0, then every characteristic line will hit every point on the t -axis for 
t > 0. Namely, the value of u(0,t) is uniquely determined by the initial value f (x), 
see Fig. 9.1 (b). In this case, the boundary condition (9.2.6) is not needed. On the 
other hand, when a>0, every characteristic line does not intersect with the upper 
half of the t-axis, see Fig. 9.1 (a). Therefore we need a boundary condition at x = 0. 
Otherwise, the solution can not be determined uniquely in the region between x = 0 
and t = 1 x, t > 0.

9.2.2 The solution of the traffic-flow equation in higher space

It follows that
U(t) = f(x0) + ^" b(x(t),T)dT, (x,t) e Rn x R +.
We summarize the above discussion to obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 9.2.2. Let ai (x, t) e C(R1 x R+1 ) be locally Lipschitz continuous with re­
spect to x in Rn x R + for all 1 < i < m. Then, for every f(x) e C(Rn), the linear 
problem (9.2.8)-(9.2.9) has a unique solution as long as a solution of the ODE system 
(9.2.10)-(9.2.11) exists. Moreover, the solution continuously depends on the known 
data if f(x) and b(x, t) is locally Lipschitz continuous with respect to x. 
□
9.3 Well-posedness for a system of first-order PDEs
We begin with a system of a first-order linear PDE with two variables (x, t) e R 1 x 
R+1 . Let U(x, t) be an m-dimensional vector-valued function. Consider the following 
system of PDE with an initial condition:
Ut + B(x,t)Ux = A(x,t)U + F(x,t), 
(x,t) e R1 x (0, w), 
(9.3.1)
U(x, 0) = U0(x), x e R1, 
(9.3.2)
where A(x, t) = (aij (x, t))mxm and B(x, t) = (bij (x, t))mxm are m x m matrices 
with
aij(x,t) e L™(R1 x R +), 
bij(x,t) e L™(R1 x R +).
In general, we do not expect that the system (9.3.1)-(9.3.2) has a global solution 
in the classical sense since the characteristics may intersect each other at some time 
t0 > 0. However, we can prove the global existence of a solution if the eigenvalues of 
B(x, t) satisfy certain conditions.
9.3.1 Global solution for the diagonal system
We first consider a special case where the coefficient matrix B is in diagonal form 
B(x, t) = diag {b 1 (x, t), ■ ■■ ,bm(x, t)} with
b 1 (x, t) < b2(x, t) < ■ ■■ < bn(x, t), 
(x, t) e R1 x R +.
Moreover, bi (x, t) e C(R1 x R+1 ) and is Lipschitz continuous w.r.t. x.
For any x0 e R1, define the characteristic curve Li : x = xi(t), t > 0 by the fol­
lowing system of ODEs:
dxi (t)
——= bi(x,t), 
t> 0,
dt
(9.3.3)

9.3 Well-posedness for a system of first-order PDEs 277
xi( 0) = x 0, 
i = 1,2, ■■■ ,m. 
(9.3.4)
From the ODE theory, the system (9.3.3)-(9.3.4) has a unique solution xi (t) globally 
in [0, rc>). Moreover, due to the assumption for bi(x, t) these characteristic curves do 
not intersect each other for t>0.
Next, we follow the same method as for a single equation and define
vi (t) = ui (xi (t), t),
t > 0,i = 1 • • • ,m.
Then,
dvi
d^- = uit + uixxi(t)
= uit + bi (xi(t), t)uix
m
= ^2 aijVj(xj(t), t) + fi(xi(t),t), 
i = 1, ••• ,m.
We perform the integration to obtain
vi(t) = vi(0) +
t n
aijvj(xi(t),t)dt +
fi (xi (t), t)dt, 
0
i = 1, • • • ,m.
(9.3.5)
Since aij is uniformly bounded in R1 x R +, we know that the system (9.3.5) has a 
unique solution globally. We summarize the above analysis as the following theorem. 
Theorem 9.3.1. Let A = (aij)nxn and F = (fi) 1xn with aij(x, t), fi(x,t) e C(R1 x 
R+1 ). Let B(x, t) be a diagonal matrix with every diagonal entry bi satisfying
b 1 (x, t) < b2(x, t) < ■ ■ • <bm(x, t), 
(x, t) e R1 x R +.
Moreover, bi (x, t) e C(R1 x R+1 ) and is Lipschitz continuous w.r.t. x. Then, the 
system (9.3.1)-(9.3.2) has a unique global solution U(x,t) e C1,1 (R1 x R+). More­
over, the solution continuously depends on the known data if aij(x, t), bij(x, t), and 
fi (x, t) are Lipschitz continuous with respect to x. 
□
9.3.2 Global solution for the diagonizable system
For a general matrix B(x, t), the system (9.3.1)-(9.3.2) may not have a global solu­
tion. However, we can prove that the system has a global solution if the matrix B(x,t) 
is symmetric and has distinct eigenvalues. The idea is to introduce a linear transform 
to reduce the matrix B(x, t) into a diagonal form.
Suppose the matrix B(x, t ) is symmetric and has m distinct eigenvalues ki(x, t ) 
with
k 1 (x, t) < k2(x, t) < • • • <km(x, t), 
(x, t) e R1 x R +.

278 CHAPTER 9 Systems of first-order partial differential equations
Let Ki (x, t) be the eigenvector corresponding to ki (x, t),
BKi = kiKi, 
(x, t) e R1 x R +.
We choose a unitary matrix Q such that
QT = Q-1, 
QBQT = diag {k 1, ••• ,km }:= B (x, t).
Introduce a new vector function V:
V(x,t) := QU(x, t), 
(x,t) e R1 x R+1 .
Then, the system (9.3.1) can be written as follows:
Vt + BVx = AV + F(x,t), 
(x,t) e R1 x R +, 
(9.3.6)
V(x, 0) = V0(x), 
x e R1, 
(9.3.7)
where
A = QtQT + QAQT + B QxQT, 
F= Q F.
From Theorem 9.3.1, we know that the system (9.3.1)-(9.3.2) has a unique solution 
globally by Theorem 9.3.1.
Theorem 9.3.2. Let B be symmetric and C 2 -differentiable. Moreover, B has n dis­
tinct eigenvalues {ki (x, t),i = 1, 2, ■ ■■ ,m} that satisfy the following property:
k 1 (x,t) < • ■■ < km(x, t), 
(x, t) e R1 x R +.
Let A(x,t) e C1 (R1 x R+) and F(x,t) e C(R1 x R+). Then, the system (9.3.1)­
(9.3.2) has a unique global solution U(x, t) e C1, 1 (R1 x R +). 
□
9.4 The solution of Maxwell’s equations
In this section we study Maxwell’s equations. Due to the curl operator, the system 
has a distinguishing feature that is different from the systems of the first-order PDE 
considered in previous sections.
9.4.1 Formulation of Maxwell’s system
Let be a bounded domain in Rn. From Section 9.1, we know that the electric field 
E and magnetic field H satisfy the following system:
£Et + a(x,t)E = Vx H + J0(x,t), 
x e Q,t> 0, 
(9.4.1)
^ H t + Vx E = M0 (x,t), 
x e Q,t > 0. 
(9.4.2)

9.4 The solution of Maxwell’s equations 279
To complete the mathematical model, we must impose appropriate initial and 
boundary conditions. The initial conditions are standard:
E(x, 0) = E0(x), H(x, 0) = H0(x), 
x e Q. 
(9.4.3)
The boundary condition is very different from previous boundary conditions con­
sidered in previous chapters. From the physics, on the surface of the medium , one 
can impose that an electric field is given in the tangential direction or normal direc­
tion. Mathematically, we prescribe one of the following boundary conditions: either
v x E(x,t) = G(x,t), 
(x,t) e da x (0, &>), 
(9.4.4)
or
v • E(x,t) = g(x,t), 
(x,t) e da x (0, <x), 
(9.4.5)
where v represents the outward unit normal on da.
Note that the boundary condition (9.4.4) or (9.4.5) is very different from those 
boundary conditions studied in previous chapters. One can prescribe a similar condi­
tion for the magnetic field H instead ofE. We focus on the boundary condition (9.4.4) 
as an example.
9.4.2 The well-posedness of Maxwell’s system
The local existence for the system (9.4.1)-(9.4.4) follows from the general theorem in 
the previous section. We are interested in the global solution. We give the following 
conditions for the known data.
For simplicity, we set s = ^ = 1. We only consider the boundary condition (9.4.4) 
with G(x, t) = 0 and M0(x, t) = 0.
Introduce a new vector function
W(x,t) =( E(x,T)dT, 
(x,t) e Q.
0
Then, it is easy to see from Eq. (9.4.2) that
H (x,t) = H0 (x) -Vx W, 
(x,t) e Q.
It follows that Maxwell’s system is equivalent to the following system for 
W(x, t):
W tt +Vx (Vx W) + a W t = J0 + Vx H0, 
(x,t) e Q, (9.4.6)
v x W(x,t) = 0, 
(x,t) e da x (0, w), 
(9.4.7)
W(x, 0) = 0, Wt(x, 0) = E0(x), x e Q. 
(9.4.8)

280 CHAPTER 9 Systems of first-order partial differential equations
Similar to a wave equation, we can define a weak solution to the system 
(9.4.6)-(9.4.8). Define
H1 (curl, div0,Q) := {U(x) e L2(Q): curlU e L2(Q), divU(x) = 0 in Q, 
v x U = 0 on d&}.
Definition 9.4.1. W(x, t) is called a weak solution to the system (9.4.6)-(9.4.8) if
W(x, t) e L“((0,T]; L2(^)^| L2((0,T]; H01 (curl, div0, Q)), Wt e L2(Qt),
and W satisfies the following integral equation:
[ [ [-Wt • Vt + (v x W) • (V x V) + aWt • V] dxdt 
J JQt
= 11 Eo(x) • V(x, 0)dx + II [J0 • V + Ho • (V x V)]dxdt,
for every test function
V e H1 ((0 ,T ]; L2 (^)^| L2 ((0 ,T ]; H01 (curl, div 0, Q)), V (x, T) = 0, V x e Q.
The following basic conditions are assumed.
H(9.4.1) (a) Let a(x, t) > 0 be bounded in Q. Let J0(x, t) be in L2(Q).
(b)Let E0(x) e L2(Q), H0(x) e H1 (Q) and the following consistency con­
dition holds:
V- H0(x) = 0, 
x e Q.
Theorem 9.4.1. Under the hypothesis H(9.4.1), the problem (9.4.6)-(9.4.8) has a 
unique global weak solution W (x,t) e L2 ((0 ,T ]; H01 (curl,div 0 ,^)) with W t e 
L2(QT). Thus there exists a unique weak solution (E, H) to the system (9.4.1)-(9.4.4) 
with
E(x, t), H(x, t) e L~((0, &>); L2(^))
with the following energy estimate:
sup [||E||l2w + ||H||l2(□)] < C(T) [llEolll2(□) + IIHolll2(□) + IIJ0IIl2(Qt)].
0<t <T
Moreover, if a(x, t) > a0 > 0 and J0 (x, t) decays to 0 as t ^ rc>, then ||E||L2 (^) 
decays to 0. Moreover, ifJ0 = 0, then,
I|E||L2(□) + IIHIIl2(□) < Ce—a0t, 
t > 0.
Proof. We define an inner production for vector-valued functions U, V as follows:
< U, V > = y (U • W)dx.

9.4 The solution of Maxwell’s equations 281
Let
M := H01 (curl, div0,Q).
Then, M = H01 (curl, div0,Q) is a Hilbert space (see [5,36]). Moreover, the norm of 
M is equivalent to
||U||M = ||Vx U||L2(□).
Define a bilinear form:
B [W, U]^ [ (Vx W) • (Vx U) + W • U] dx.
Then, one can easily verify that B [W, U] satisfies the Lax-Milgram conditions. Now, 
we can use the same argument as for a wave equation in Chapter 5 to obtain a global 
weak solution for W(x, t).
To show the energy estimate, we note the following identity: if v x E = 0 on dQ, 
then
( (Vx E) • H dx = j E • (Vx H )dx.
We take the inner production for Eq. (9.4.1) with E and Eq. (9.4.2) with H to obtain
ddt 11 [|E|2 + |H|2] dx + £ o |E|2 dx
<1 [J0 • E] dx
< e£[|E|2]dx + -1-£ [|Jo|2]dx.
Gronwall’s inequality yields the desired estimate.
Next, we show that the solution decays if o(x, t) > o0 > 0. By a similar estimate 
as above, we have for any e > 0
ddt 1 £[|E|2 + |H|2]dx + (o0 - e)j |E|2dx
< C(e) 
|J0|2dx.
It follows that ||E||L2(Q) decays to 0 if ||J0||L2(q) decays to 0. Moreover, if J0 = 0, 
then
[ [|E|2 +|H|2 dx < Ce - o0 t.

CHAPTER 9 Systems of first-order partial differential equations
9.5 The conservation law and shock waves
In this section we present an introduction to the conservation law with the following 
form
ut + f(x,t,u)x =0.
The characteristic method introduced in the previous section can be used to find a 
solution of the conservation law.
9.5.1 A simple example: Solution of Burgers’ equation
We begin with Burgers’ equation in which f(x, t, u) = 2u2 to illustrate the charac­
teristic method for a nonlinear equation.
Example 9.5 .1. Consider an initial-value problem:
ut + uux = 0, 
x e R1 ,t > 0, 
(9.5.1)
u(x, 0) = g(x), 
x e R1, 
(9.5.2)
where g(x) is a continuous function.
To find the solution to (9.5.1)-(9.5.2) we define a characteristic curve L : x = 
x(t), t > 0 as follows:
dx (t)
—— = u(x(t),t), 
t > 0, 
(9.5.3)
dt
x(0) = x0, 
(9.5.4)
where x0 e R1 is arbitrary.
Then, along the characteristic curve L,
du(x(t),t)
, 
= Ut + uxx (t) = Ut + uux = 0,
dt
which implies that u(x (t), t) must be a constant for t > 0.
It follows that every characteristic curve L must be a straight line with a slope 
u(x(t) t). As long as we know g(x), we can find the solution u(x, t) in the classical 
sense for small t>0. On the other hand, if there exist two points x1 <x2 such that
g(x1) > g(x2),
then the slope for the characteristic line L1 starting with x1 is less than the charac­
teristic line L2 starting with x2. This implies that the solution u(x, t) will not exist in 
the classical sense even if g(x) e C“ (R1). See Fig. 9.2.
Example 9.5 .2. Let
0 ifx<0,
g(x) = 
1 ifx>0. 
(9.5.5)

9.5 The conservation law and shock waves 283
FIGURE 9.2
Find the solution of (9.5.1)-(9.5.2).
Solution. Define regions A, B, and C as follows:
A := {(x, t): —^ < x < 0,t > 0}.
B :== {(x , t ) : 0 <x <t, t > 0}.
C := {(x, t): t < x < <x,t > 0}.
Based on the characteristic method, we easily see that u(x, t) = 0 if (x, t) e A and 
u(x, t) = 1 if (x, t) e C. u(x, t) cannot be determined in the region B.
Suppose we set
u1(x, t) =
0, if (x,t) e B,0 <x< 2;
1, if (x, t) e B, 2 < x < t.
Then, we can easily see that u1(x, t) satisfies Eq. (9.5.1) except on the curve L : x = 
2, t > 0 (see Fig. 9.3). We will see that the curve L can be derived from the structure 
of the solution.
On the other hand, we define
u2(x, t) = —, 
(x,t) e B.
Then, u2 is also a solution of (9.5.1)-(9.5.2). See Fig. 9.4.
From this example, we see that the solution of (9.5.1)-(9.5.2) is not unique in 
general. The curve L : x = 2, t > 0 is called a shock wave. However, since u(x, t) is 
bounded, this shock wave is nonphysical. The solution u2(x, t) is called a rarefaction 
wave.

1, if x > 1.
(9.5.6)
Solution. Note that the characteristic curve L is a straight line with slope 1 for x>0, 
while the characteristic line is vertical for x<0. Now, we define three regions A, B, 
and C as follows:
A := {(x, t): —^ < x < 0,t > 0}.

C := {(x, t): 1 < x < rc>,t > 0}.

9.5 The conservation law and shock waves 285
Clearly, u(x, t) = 0 in A and u(x, t) = 1 in C. For any point (x, t) e B, the slope of 
the characteristic line L passing any point x0 e (0, 1) at t = 0 is equal to
t

 = -----------  = —. 
x - x0--- u(x (t), t)---- x0
Since u(x, t) is a constant along the line L, it follows that
x
u(x,t) = x 0 = ——
1+t
Hence,
u(x, t) =
0, if x<0,
1+t, if0 <x < 1, t > 0,
1, if x > 1, t> 0.
Note that u(x, t) is continuous in R + x R1. The trajectory of the solution u(x, t) is 
the rarefaction wave, see Fig. 9.5.

0, if x > 0.
(9.5.7)
Solution. Note that the characteristic curve L is a straight line with slope 1 for x< 
-1, while the characteristic line is vertical for x>0. It follows that two lines have 
an intersection point at x = 0, t = 1. Now, we define three regions A, B, and C as 
follows:
A := {(x, t): —^ < x <t, 0 <t < 1}.

286 CHAPTER 9 Systems of first-order partial differential equations
B := {(x, t) : t<x<0, 0 <t<1}.
C := {(x, t): 0 < x < rc>, 0 <t < 1}.
It is easy to see that u(x, t) = 1 in A and u(x, t) = 0 in C. For any point (x, t) e B, 
the slope of the characteristic line L passing any point x0 at t = 0 is equal to
t

=------------=---------. 
x - x0--- u(x(t), t) 1 - x0

0, if x > 1,0 < t < 1.
For t > 1, if we define a curve L : s(t) = 1+, we find that
1, ifx<s(t),t>1, 
u(x, t) =
0. if x > s(t)1, t>1,
satisfies Eq. (9.5.2) except on the curve L : x = 1+, t > 1.
The solution u(x, t) is called the shock-wave solution. The curve L : x = 
t > 1 is called a shock wave. See Fig. 9.6.

9.5.2 The solution for a general conservation law
Now, we can extend the above idea to a general nonlinear equation (9.5.1). Consider 
the following initial-value problem:
Ut + f(u)x = 0, 
(x,t) e R1 X R +, 
(9.5.8)
u(x, 0) = g(x), 
x e R1. 
(9.5.9)
Theorem 9.5.1. Let f(u) e C2(R1) and f"(u) > 0. Let g(x) be in C1 (R1).
(a) If g(x') is monotone increasing in R1, then the problem (9.5.8)-(9.5.9) has at 
least a classical solution globally in time.
(b) If there exist two points x1 <x2 with g(x1) > g(x2), then the problem 
(9.5.8)-(9.5.9) has no global solution in the classical sense.
Proof. As in Example 9.5.1, for any x0 e R1 we can define the characteristic curve 
as follows:
dx(t)
—— = f (u(x(t),t), 
dt
x(0) = x0 .
These characteristic curves are straight lines with slope fu^t,) (see Fig. 9.7). 
Moreover, all these lines do not intersect each other if g(x) is monotone increasing 
in R1. This implies that a solution as rarefaction waves exists globally. On the other 
hand, when g(x) does not satisfy the monotone condition in (a), at least two lines will 
intersect at some t = 10 > 0. Therefore the solution has a singularity when t ^ 10, 
which implies that u(x, t) does not exist in the classical sense when t > 10. 
□
From Example 9.5.2, we know that a classical solution for Eq. (9.5.8)-(9.5.9) may 
not exist, so it is natural to seek a solution in a weak sense.

Definition 9.5.1. A function u(x, t) e L1(R x R+1 ) is called an integral solution to 
(9.5.8)-(9.5.9) if the integral equation (9.5.10) holds.
We have seen from Example 9.5.2 that the integral solution may not be unique. 
The problem (9.5.8)-(9.5.9) may have an infinite number of nontrivial solutions for 
some g(x). The interested reader may consult [29]. To find a solution that can fit 
the physical model, we need to specify additional conditions, called the entropy con­
ditions. We shall not investigate this general issue in this book. However, we will 
discuss a special case in the following subsection.
9.5.3 Rankine-Hugoniot condition
In this subsection we assume that u(x, t) takes only two values ul and ur in R1 x R+1 
except a curve L : x = s(t), t > 0. Moreover, we assume that s(t) is differentiable in 
(0, 0). Define
[[u]] = ur - ul := jump of u(x, t) across the curve L,
[[f]] := f(ur) - f(ul) := jump of f (u) across the curve L, 
a := s'(t) := speed the curve C moves as t increases.
Since the curve L is differentiable in (0, 0), we see the unit normal to the curve 
L is equal to
v =

s'(t)
—. 
.----- .
1+ + s'(t)2

t>0.
Ifwe use Green’s theorem, from the integral identity (9.5.10) we see that
{ {[[[f ]]v 1 + [[u]]v2]v(x,t)}ds = 0,
It follows that
Vv(x,t) e C0(R1 x R +)■
s'(t) Jf*,
( ) 
[[u ]] ,
t>0. 
(9.5.11)
Eq. (9.5.11) is called the Rankine-Hugoniot condition and the curve C : x = s(t), 
t > 0 is called a shock wave.
For Example 9.5.2, we have
f(u) = u2, [[f(u)]] = 2, [[u]] = 1 ■

9.6 A class of semilinear wave equations 289
The Rankine-Hugoniot condition implies
5'(t ) = - , 
t > 0.
Hence,
s(t) = 2-, 
t> 0.
Similarly, we can deduce the curve x = 5(t) in other examples.
9.6 A class of semilinear wave equations
In this section we study the global solvability for a class of semilinear wave equations. 
It will be seen that the problem has very different features in comparison with the 
problems for semilinear heat equations. The regularity of the weak solution for a 
wave equation may develop a singularity even if the solution is uniformly bounded. 
It is still a very active research topic in the study of nonlinear hyperbolic partial 
differential equations (see [30]). We introduce different methods to prove the solution 
of a semilinear wave equation blows up in finite time.
9.6.1 The global existence
Let be a bounded domain in Rn with C 1-boundary and T > 0,
Qt = V x (0 ,T ], 
Q := Q x (0, w).
Suppose f(5)is locally Lipschitz in R1.
Consider the following problem:
utt - Au = f(u), 
(x,t) e Q, 
(9.6.1)
u(x,t) = 0, 
(x,t) e dQ x (0, w), 
(9.6.2)
u(x, 0) = g1(x), ut (x, 0) = g2(x), 
x e Rn, 
(9.6.3)
where g 1 (x) e H1 (Q), g2 (x) e L2 (Q).
Define
u
F(u) = 
f(5)d5, u e R1.

Let
E(t) := - y [ut + |Vu|2]dx — y F(u)dx.
It is clear that
E(t) = E(0),
Vt e [0, ^).

290 CHAPTER 9 Systems of first-order partial differential equations
If
F F(u)dx < 0, 
Vt e [0, <x>),

then
[ [|ut|2 + |Vu|2]dx < ( [|g2|2 + |Vgi|2]dx,
provided that the initial data g 1 (x) e H1 (Q) and g2(x) e L2(Q).
Theorem 9.6.1. Let the following sign condition hold:
uf (u) <0, 
Vu e R1.
Suppose g 1 (x) e H 1 (Q), g2(x) e L2(Q) and F(g 1) e L 1 (Q). Then, the problem 
(9.6.1 )-(9.6.3) has a global weak solution u(x, t) with
ut(x, t), Vu e L™((0, w); L2(^)).
Moreover,
supE(t) < E(0).
t >0
Proof. First, we note that the sign condition implies that
u
f(s)ds< 0,u e R1.
0
We use a similar argument for the linear wave equation to establish the global ex­
istence. As a first step we construct an approximation solution by using the finite- 
element method. Choose all orthogonal eigenfunctions for the Laplace operator asso­
ciated with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, denoted by {^k(x)}k=1. 
Define
N
uN(x, t)
dN dN (t)'^k(x), 
k=1
where dkN (t ) is the solution of the nonlinear ODE:
dN(t)" + \kdN(t) = < f(uN), ^k>,k = 1, 2, ••• ,N, 
(9.6.4) 
dk (0) = < gN,^k >, dN(t)' = < gN,^k >,
(9.6.5)
where gN = 
k=1 < g 1 ,^k> ^k, gN = EN=1 < g2,'^k > ^k. Since f (s) is lo­
cally Lipschitz continuous, the above ODE system (9.6.4)-(9.6.5) has a local solution

9.6 A class of semilinear wave equations 291
{dkN(t), k = 1, 2 ••• ,N,} on [0 ,T0] for To > 0. To prove the global existence, we note 
that

where C depends only on known data.
Consequently, the local solution {d^ (t)} can be extended into [0, ^). Next, from 
the construction of the approximation solution uN (x, t), we have
dE-EN)< < 0. 
dt
It follows that
sup [|| (uN)t || L 2 (Q) + ||V uN || L 2 (qJ < C, 
t>0
where C is a constant independent of N.
If we use the weak compactness of L2(QT) and the compact embedding from 
H1(QT) into L2(QT), we can extract a subsequence from uN(x, t) (still denoted by 
uN) such that uN(x, t) converges to a limit function u(x, t) strongly in L2(QT) as 
well as a.e. in QT. Moreover, (uN)t, VuN(x,t) converge, respectively, to ut(x,t), 
V u(x, t) weakly in L 2 (QT). Since f(s) is continuous in R1, we see that u(x, t) is a 
weak solution for the problem (9.6.1)-(9.6.3). 
□
If a bounded domain is replaced by Rn, we can obtain the same result in The­
orem 9.6.1 for Eqs. (9.6.1) and (9.6.3) in Rn.

292 CHAPTER 9 Systems of first-order partial differential equations
From Theorem 9.6.1, we see that for any p>1 and
f(u) = -|u|p-1u,
there exists a global weak solution. Particularly, when p> 1 is an odd integer, then
f(u)=-up
satisfies the sign condition. Hence, a global weak solution exists. However, the reg­
ularity of the weak solution is extremely challenging, since there is no general regu­
larity results for nonlinear wave equations. Even if we know that u(x, t) is uniformly 
bounded, u(x, t) may not be smooth. However, if the dimension n < 3, then one can 
show that a bounded weak solution is indeed smooth if 1 < p < 5 (see Chapter 12 in 
[8]).
9.6.2 The finite-time blowup
Next, we give some sufficient conditions to prove that a solution of a semilinear wave 
equation will blow up in finite time.
Theorem 9.6.2. Assume that there exists a constant k > 2 such that
zf(z) > kF(z), 
Vz e R1.
Then, the solution u(x, t) of the problem (9.6.1 )-(9.6.3) will blow up infinite time if
E(0) := 2 L[lVg 1l2 + ।g2l2]dx ~ L F(g 1 )dx < 0'
Proof. We use the convexity argument. Assume the problem (9.6.1)-(9.6.3) has a 
global solution for all t > 0. Recall the conservation of energy, we have
E(t) = |y [|ut|2 + |Vu|2]dx - I F(u)dx = E(0).
Define
I(t) = - U u2dx.
A direct calculation shows that
I"(t) = j [u2 - |Vu|2 + uf(u)]dx.
Let a > 0 be a parameter. By using the energy identity and choosing a = k-2 we find 
that

9.6 A class of semilinear wave equations 293
I" (t) + (2 + 4 a)E( 0)
= (2 + 2a) y u2dx + 2a j |Vu |2dx — (2 + 4a) j F(u)dx + j uf(u)dx
>[(2 + 2a) j u2dx.
It follows that
I''(t) > (2 + 2a) I u2dx — (2 + 4a)E(0) > 0.
On the other hand,
I'(t)2

Define
J(t)=I(t)—a,

J»(t) = a( 1 + a)I'(t)2 — aI(t) - (1+a) I" (t)
<aXI(t)—(1+a)E(0)<0, 
t>0.
It follows that J(t) is a concave function on [0, rc>). Suppose J'(t) > 0 for all t > 0. 
Then, I(t) is monotone increasing on [0, rc>). It follows that
J'(t) < J'(0) + aE(0) jT I(t)-(1+a)dt < J'(0) + aE(0)I(0)-(1+a)t < 0,
if t is sufficiently large. This is a contradiction. On the other hand, if there exists a 
point 10 > 0 with J'(t0) < 0, then, by Taylor’s expansion, we have
J(t) < J(t0) + (t — 10)J'(t0),
which will be negative if t is sufficiently large, a contradiction.
Consequently, I(t ) must blow up in finite time. 
□
For any p>0, consider the following semilinear problem:
utt — &u = Xu + |u |1+p, 
(x,t) e Q, 
(9.6.6)
u(x,t) = 0, 
(x,t) e dQ x (0, ^),

Define
X * :=
u(x, 0) = g(x),ut(x, 0) = g2(x), 
x e ^. 
(9.6.8)
Let X 1 be the principle eigenvalue of the Laplace operator associated with a Dirichlet 
boundary condition on £2 and $ 1 (x) be the corresponding positive eigenfunction with
(p 1 (x)dx = 1.
Let
a := / $ 1 (x)g 1 (x)dx, 
ft := 
$ 1 (x)g2(x)dx.

Lemma 9.6.1. Let b > 0 and y(t) satisfy the following differential inequality:
y"(t) > by(t) + | y(t) |1+p, 
t > 0
with initial conditions:
y(0) = a> 0, 
y'(0) = ft > 0.
Then, y(t) must blow up in finite time.
Proof. Suppose y(t) exists on [0, T] for any T>0. We claim
y(t) > 0,y'(t) > 0, t e (0,T].
If y(t) attains a positive local maximum at t0 e (0, T], then at t = t0, 
y"(t0) > by(t0) + |y(t0)|1+p > 0.
This is a contradiction. It follows that y'(t) > 0 on [0,T]. Suppose there exists a point 
10 e (0,T] such that y'(t0) = 0. As
y" (t0) > | y(t0) |1+p > 0,
we see for a sufficiently small £ > 0,
y'(t0 - £)< y'(t0) = 0,
i.e., a contradiction.
Suppose y(t) exists on [0, ^) and
lim y(t) = c < ^.
t ^TO

9.6 A class of semilinear wave equations 295
Then, there exists a sequence tn ^ to such that y'(tn) ^ 0. As b > 0 and y(t) > 0, 
hence,
TO
I 
y(s) 1+pds < —ft< TO,

which implies, c = 0, a contradiction since y(t) is monotone increasing on [0, TO) 
and y(0) = a > 0. Consequently, y(t) must blow up in finite time. 
□
Theorem 9.6.3. Suppose k > k* and a > 0. Then, the solution of the problem 
(9.6.6)-(9.6.8) blows up infinite time.
Proof. The method is similar to the case for a parabolic equation. Suppose the prob­
lem (9.6.6)-(9.6.8) has a global solution. Define
y(t) := j u(x,t)$ 1 (x)dx, 
y(0) = a > 0, y' (0) = ft > 0.
Define
T* := sup{T : y(t) > 0, Vt e [0,T]}.
We claim T* =TO. Indeed, if T* < TO,
y" (t) = (k — k 1 )y + j | u |1+p0 1 (x)dx > (k — k 1 )y + y(t) 1+p, 0 <t <T *.
By Lemma 9.6.1, y(t) is monotone increasing on [0, T *), a contradiction, since 
y(0) = a>0. Thus T* =TO. Now, we see that y(t) satisfies all conditions in 
Lemma 9.6.1 in [0, to). It follows that y(t) must blow up in finite time. 
□
By using the same argument, we can obtain the blowup result for the Neumann 
boundary condition.
Corollary 9.6.1. Let u(x, t) be a solution for the problem (9.6.6),(9.6.8) with the 
following Neumann boundary condition:
Vvu(x,t) = 0, 
(x,t) e dQ. 
(9.6.9)
If k > 0 and
a := 
g 1 (x)dx > 0, ft := 
g2(x)dx > 0,
then, u(x, t) must blow up in finite time.
Proof. With the Neumann boundary condition (9.5.7), we define
y(t) = u(x, t)dx.

296 CHAPTER 9 Systems of first-order partial differential equations
Then, y(t) satisfies
y"(t) > ^y(t) + j |u(x,t)|p+1 dx, 
y(0) = a> 0, y' (0) = $ > 0.
Now,
|y(t) |1+p < j |u |1+pdx|a|p+1, 
t > 0.
It follows that
y"(t) > ^y(t) + k0|y(t)|1+p,
where k0 > 0.
Again by Lemma 9.6.1, y(t) blows up in a finite time. 
□
9.7 Remarks and notes
In this section we studied a general linear system of first-order equations. The char­
acteristic method is introduced to solve the system. One section is devoted to the 
investigation of Maxwell’s system and its global solvability is established. We also 
studied a class of the conservation law and illustrate how the solution may develop 
shock waves when the initial condition satisfies certain conditions. These materials 
are very standard and students with basic ODE knowledge can easily understand 
them. To show the difference from the linear equations and systems, we studied a 
class of semilinear wave equations. Some global existence and finite-time blowups 
are proved by using elementary analysis from ODEs. This part of the material is 
intended for students as motivation for further research in PDEs.

APPENDIX
Some essential results in 
ordinary differential 
equations
A
In this appendix we state some basic results in ordinary differential equations for the 
readers’ convenience. The interested readers may consult standard textbooks such as 
[27] to find more detailed proofs.
A.1 The solution of a first-order differential equation and 
stability
A.1.1 Existence and uniqueness for first-order differential equations 
Let a(t), f(t) be known functions defined on [0, rc>). For a linear first-order differ­
ential equation,
y' + a(t)y = f(t),y( 0) = y 0.
One can find the explicit solution
y(t) = y0e- fta(T)dT + f f(s)efsa(T)dTds, 
0
provided that a(t) and f (t) are integrable over [0,T] for any T>0.
For a nonlinear ODE, we need much stronger conditions in order to have a unique 
solution. The following theorem is typically proved in standard textbooks.
Theorem A.1.1. Let f(t, y) be continuous with respect to t in [0, rc>) and locally 
Lipschitz continuous with respect to y in R1. Then, for any (t0,y0) e R + x R1 the 
first-order differential equation:
dy
= = f(t,y), 
dt
y(t0) = y0
t > 10,
has a unique solution y = y(t) in [t0, t0 + h] for some h>0. Moreover, the solution 
can be extended to the maximal interval [ t, T *) as long as y(t) is bounded in [0 ,T ]

with any T <T * and
lim y(t) = to.
t ^ t *
The solution y(t) obtained in Theorem A.1.1 is also continuously dependent upon 
the initial value. However, the solution may show a huge difference when the Lips­
chitz constant is suitably large.
A.1.2 The stability analysis for an autonomous equation
Recall a solution y = y(t) of an ODE is said to be asymptotically stable if y(t) has a 
finite limit, say y0, as t ^ to.
For an autonomous equation
y' = f(y),
we call y = y0 an equilibrium solution if f (y0) = 0.
Theorem A.1.2. Suppose that y0 is an equilibrium solution for the differential equa­
tion
y' = f(y),
where f(y)is a differentiable function. Then, one of the following cases holds:
(a) if f' (y0) < 0, the y = y0 is asymptotically stable;
(b) if f' (y0) > 0, then y = y0 is unstable;
(c) if f' (x0) = 0, no conclusion can be drawn.
For the case (c), one needs to analyze the solution behavior as t evolves.
A.2 Basic results for second-order differential equations
For a second-order differential equation
y" = f(t,y,y'),
with initial conditions:
y(t0) = y 0 ,y'(t0) = y 1,
the sufficient conditions for the general existence and uniqueness are similar to the 
general system of the first-order ODEs:
Y' = F (t, Y).
A special linear case of the second-order ODE is the following theorem.

APPENDIX A Some essential results in ordinary differential equations 301
Theorem A.2.1. Let p(t) and q(t) be continuous in [0,T]. Then, the second-order 
linear equation
y" + p(t)y' + q(t)y = g(t), t > 0,
subject to initial values:
y( 0) = y 0 ,y' (0) = y 1,
has a unique solution y(t) in [0, T]. Moreover, the general solution can be expressed 
by
y(t) = c1y1(t) + c2y2(t) + yc(t),
where y1(t) and y2(t) are linearly independent solutions for the homogeneous equa­
tion, while yc (t) is a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation.
In particular, for an second-order ODE with constant coefficients
ay" + by' + cy = g(t),
one can find the explicit solution representation. The general solution of the above 
equation depends on the characteristic equation
ar2 + br + c = 0.
Case 1: b2 - 4ac > 0.
Let r1 and r2 be two real roots of the characteristic equation. Then, the general 
solution of the homogeneous equation is equal to
y(t) = c1er1t + c2er2t.
Case 2: b2 - 4ac < 0.
Let r1 = d1 + id2 and r2 = d1 - id2 be the complex roots of the characteristic 
equation. Then, the general solution of the homogeneous equation is equal to
y(t) = ed1t [c1 cos(d2t) + c2 sin(d2t)] .
Case 3: b2 - 4ac = 0.
Let r = r 1 = r2 = - b be the roots of the characteristic equation. Then, the gen­
eral solution of the homogeneous equation is equal to
y(t) = c1ert + c2tert.
A.3 Dynamics of the solution of a linear system of ODEs
Let
A = a11 a12 
a21 a22 .

302 APPENDIX A Some essential results in ordinary differential equations
Consider an 2 x 2 linear system of ODE:
Y = A Y.
The asymptotic stability of the steady-state solution depends on the eigenvalues of 
the matrix A.
Theorem A.3.1. The steady-state solution Y = 0 must satisfy one of the following 
cases:
(a) a saddle point if A has two distinct eigenvalues with one positive and one nega­
tive;
(b) a nodal sink if A has two real and negative eigenvalues;
(c) a nodal source if A has two real and positive eigenvalues;
(d) a spiral sink if A has two complex conjugate eigenvalues with a negative real 
part;
(e) a spiral source if A has two complex conjugate eigenvalues with a positive real 
part;
(f) a center if A has two pure complex conjugate eigenvalues.
From Theorem A.3.1, we see that the steady-state solution Y = 0 is asymptoti­
cally stable for cases (b) and (d) and unstable for the cases (a), (c), (e), and (f). The 
same idea can be extended into an n x n system of ODEs.
Theorem A.3.2. The steady-state solution Y = 0 to the linear system
Y' = A Y
must have one of the following cases:
(a) asymptotically stable if the real part of all eigenvalues of A is negative;
(b) unstable ifat least one of the eigenvalues of A is positive;
(c) undetermined if some of the eigenvalues are equal to 0.
In applications, the above results are often used in dealing with the stability anal­
ysis for a nonlinear autonomous system:
Y' = F(Y) = (f1 (yi,... ,yn), ••• ,fn{y 1, ... ,yn))T.
Suppose F is a differentiable vector field. Define the Jacobian matrix ofF:
A ■=( f}
dyj n x n
Theorem A.3.3. Let Y0 be an equilibrium solution for the nonlinear system
Y' = F (Y).

APPENDIX A Some essential results in ordinary differential equations 303
Then, the stability of Y = Y0 is the same as the equilibrium solution for the linear 
system
Y = A Y,
where A is the Jacobian matrix of F at Y = Y0 .
In nonlinear dynamics analysis, one of the complications comes from the fact that 
some eigenvalues of the matrix A are equal to 0. One needs to find more information 
about the Hessian matrix of F in order to determine the stability of the equilibrium 
solution.

B.1 
Weak derivatives and Sobolev spaces
Let £2 c Rn be a region with a smooth boundary dQ. Let a = (a 1, ■ ■■ ,an) be a 
multiindex with | a | = n= 
nk=1 ak.
B.1.1 Weak derivatives
Definition B.1.1. Let u(x), v(x) e L]1oc(^). We say that v(x) = Dau(x) in the weak 
sense if
y u(x)Da$(x)dx = (—1)1 a 1 j v(x)$(x)dx
for every test function $(x) e C“ (Q)
Clearly, if u(x) is |a|-th differentiable in the classical sense, then the above inte­
gral identity holds. Conversely, it may not be true. All elementary properties such as 
the product rule and quotient rule for the classical derivative also hold for the weak 
derivative as long as all the resulting functions belong to L]oc(Q.).
As we will see below, a function that has a weak derivative has some regular­
ity. The weak derivative is stronger than the generalized derivative in the sense of 
distribution. For example, we know that 
&(x) = dH(x) 
dx
in the sense of distribution. However, H(x) is not differentiable in the weak sense.
B.1.2 Sobolev spaces
Let k > 1 be an integer and p > 1.
Definition B.1.2. (Sobolev spaces) Let k =|a | and define the set
Wk,p(^) = {all functions with |a |th-derivative exist and ||u ||Wk,p(^) < ^}, 
where
||u||wk,?(Q) = ^3 ||Dau||Lp(^). 
| a |< k
305

306 APPENDIX B Sobolev spaces
It can be shown that Wk,p(Q) with the above norm is a Banach space. In particu­
lar, when p = 2 it is a Hilbert space. We use the notation
Hk(Q) = Wk 2 (Q).
The inner product of Hk(&) is defined by
(u, v) = ^2 < Dau, Dav > .
I a |< k
When p = to, the norm for Wk, “ (Q) is defined by
IIuIIW2,~(Q) 
ess.sup®|Da(O)|.
I a |< k
Definition B.1.3.
Wk,p(Q) := the closure of C%(&) under the norm Wk,p(Q).
In particular, when p = 2,
Hk(O) = Wk,2 (O).
A nice result ([23]) is that the norm of W1 ,p(^) for any p > 1 is equivalent to
IIV U II Lp(&) + IIU II LP(d&).
In particular, for W01,2(Q), its norm is equivalent to IIVuIIL2(Q). A more general 
result for a bounded domain with a Lipschitz boundary is that the norm of W1 ,p(^) 
is equivalent to
IIV u II LP(a) + p(u),
where p(u) is a continuous seminorm for W1 ,p(^) (see [31]).
In applications, one may need a Sobolev space H-1 (Q) := W01,2(Q)', the dual 
space of W01,2(Q). It can be characterized by the following representation. For every 
f e H-1 (Q), there exists a set of functions {fi(x)}"=0 in L2(Q) such that
< f, v >=

APPENDIX B Sobolev spaces 307
B.2 Smooth approximation and Sobolev embedding
The next result shows that every function in a Sobolev space can be approximated by 
a smooth function sequence.
B.2.1 Smooth approximation
Theorem B.2.1. Let be a bounded domain with C1 -boundary. Suppose u(x) e 
Wkp(Q). Then, there exists a sequence um(x) e C“(Q) such that
II um — u || Wk,P(Q) ^ 0, 
as m ^^.
With the above smooth approximation, we can define the value on a hypersurface 
S c for a function in a Sobolev space, which is called the trace of the function on 
S, denoted by T r(u)(x).
For example,
Wk,p(Q) = {u e Wkp(Q): Tr(u)(x) = 0 on 9^}.
B.2.2 Sobolev embedding
A function u(x) in a Sobolev space Wk,p(^) has some regularity. The following 
embedding theorem gives a precise regularity.
Theorem B.2.2. Let be a region in Rn with C1 -boundary. Suppose u(x) e 
Wk,p(Q).
(a) If kp < n, then u(x) e Lq(Q) and
|| u || Lq(&) < C || u || Wkp(Q),
where
pn 
q n — kp
(b) If kp > n, then u(x) e Ck-[p]-1 ,Y(£!) with
Y =
[n] + 1 - n, 
if p is not an integer
any number in (0,1), if p is an integer.
The above embedding theorem shows that a function will be continuous or differ­
entiable if the order of the weak derivative is suitably higher. A more subtle result is 
the following compactness embedding.
Theorem B.2.3. Let U be a bounded domain subset in Rn with C1 -boundary dQ. 
Then, the embedding operator Ie from Wk,p(Q) into Lq(&.) is compact for any q e

B.3 Sobolev spaces with t -variable
B.3.1 The space Lp((0,t); X) and V2(QT)
In dealing with time-dependent PDEs, the time derivative needs a special attention.
Let X be a Banach space. Define
Lp( 0 ,T ]; X) = {u(x, t): [0 ,T ]^ X, || u || x g Lp( 0 ,T)}.
The norm for Lp ((0, T]; X) is denoted by
||u||Lp(0,T);X) =
||u||Xdx
0
1 
p
One can easily extend Lp(0, T); X) to other Sobolev spaces such as H1 ((0, T); X), 
etc.
For parabolic equations, the weak solution has a better regularity with respect to 
the t-variable. One needs to introduce a Sobolev space V2(QT) as follows:
V2 (Qt) := {u(x, t) G C( [0 ,T ]; W1,2 (Q))}.
The norm for V2 (QT ) is given by
||uIIV2(Qt) :— max ||u||L2(q) + ||Vu||L2(qt).

L (QT)
B.3.2 A compact embedding result
Theorem B.3.1. (Aubin-Lions lemma) Let X0, X and X 1 be three Banach spaces 
with X0 c X c X 1. Suppose that X0 is compactly embedded in X and that X is 
continuously embedded in X 1. For 1 < p, q < rc>. Let
W — {u g Lp( [0 ,T ]; X 0) | ii g Lq( [0 ,T ]; X 1)}.
(i) If p < rc>, then the embedding of W into Lp([0,T]; X) is compact.
(ii) If p — rc> and q > 1 then the embedding of W into C([0,T]; X) is compact.
