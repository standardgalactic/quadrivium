Introduction
T
here’s a reason why Photoshop is the world’s industry standard in
image-editing software. The depth and breadth of the program is unher-
alded. Photoshop immediately sucks you in with its easy-to-use interface
and powerful tools and commands. It is so feature rich that you soon begin
to lose track of time and start blowing off your commitments just to try one
more thing. And just when you think you’ve finally explored every nook and
cranny and mastered the program, you suddenly read a tip in a book or
magazine that enlightens you about something you didn’t know. Or even
more likely, you stumble upon some great effect while working on a late-
night project. That’s the beauty of Photoshop. It’s the program that just
keeps giving.
The depth and breadth of Photoshop has downsides, too, of course. You
must make a major time commitment and invest much effort to master it —
hence the large number of books written on the program. Walk into your
neighborhood bookstore or type Photoshop in the Search field at any online
bookseller’s site, and you see a barrage of choices. Some books are general
reference books, some are targeted toward the novice user, and others
focus on a specific mission, such as color management or restoration and
retouching.
About This Book
This book is written for the person who has a good grasp of using a com-
puter and navigating the operating system and at least a cursory knowledge
of Photoshop. It is intended to be a comprehensive reference book that you
can read cover to cover or reach for when you’re looking for specific infor-
mation about a particular task.
Wherever I can, I sneak in a useful tip or an interesting technique to help
you put Photoshop to work for your project needs.
Sometimes, knowing how to use a tool doesn’t necessarily mean that you
know what to do with it. That’s why this book contains several Putting It
Together exercises that help you make a connection between the multiple
Photoshop tools at your disposal and the very specific task you need to
accomplish. Want to get the red out of a subject’s eyes or create a collage?
Just check out the Putting-It-Together sections in Books III through IX. These

What’s in This Book
2
sections present info in easy-to-follow numbered steps, in a hands-on style,
building on what’s presented in the chapter so that you can go to the next
level, put concepts to work, and move on to the next task.
You can find images that appear within the Putting It Together sections on
this book’s companion Web site (www.dummies.com/go/photoshopcs3), so
you can follow along precisely with the steps. 
What’s in This Book
This book is broken into minibooks, each covering a general topic. Each
minibook contains several chapters, each covering a more specific topic
under the general one. Each chapter is then divided into sections, and some
of those sections have subsections. I’m sure you get the picture.
You can read the book from front to back, or you can dive right into the
minibook or chapter of your choice. Either way works just fine. Anytime a
concept is mentioned that isn’t covered in depth in that chapter, you find a
cross-reference to another book and chapter where you find all the details.
If you’re looking for something specific, check out either the Table of
Contents or the Index.
The Cheat Sheet at the beginning of the book helps you remember all the
shortcuts you’ll use most often. Tear it out, tape it to your monitor, and
glance over it when you need to.
And finally, I have pictures. Lots of them. And this time they’re in full, living
color. Many of these pictures have callouts that point to specific steps or
identify important concepts, buttons, tools, or options. With a program like
Photoshop, an image often speaks louder than words. 
This book contains nine minibooks. The following sections offer a quick
synopsis of what each book contains.
Photoshop has such an abundance of tools — and so many ways to use
those tools — I can’t possibly cover them all in this book. But if you’re look-
ing for details on the less commonly used features or perhaps more infor-
mation about using tools you’re already familiar with, you’ll find them on
this book’s companion Web site (www.dummies.com/go/photoshopcs3). 
Book I: Photoshop Fundamentals
Ready to get your feet wet with the basics of Photoshop? Head to Book I.
Here’s where you get familiar with the Photoshop environment — the desk-
top, menus, and palettes. I also briefly introduce the key tools and explain
what each one does.

What’s in This Book
3
In this book, I cover how to get started on Photoshop and how to view and
navigate your image window. Here’s also where I give you all the important
details about the o’mighty Adobe Bridge and how to customize your work-
space and preference settings. 
Finally, I go into the bare basics of printing, and then how to save files and
close Photoshop.
Book II: Image Essentials
This book covers all those nitpicky — but critical — details about images,
such as size, resolution, pixel dimension, image mode, and file format. Turn
to this book to find out how to safely resize your image without causing
undue damage. 
You can also find out how to crop images and increase their canvas size. In
addition, I breeze through basic color theory and get you started using and
managing color.
But wait, there’s more. I give you the lowdown on the History palette and
brushing and erasing to history. And, if that’s not enough, I throw in a chap-
ter on using and creating actions for enhanced productivity.
Book III: Selections
This important book gives you all the juicy details and techniques on creat-
ing and modifying selections and paths. You find out about each of the selec-
tion tools and also the powerful — albeit sometimes unruly — Pen tool and
its accompanying Paths palette.
Book IV: Painting, Drawing, and Typing
If you want to know about the drawing and painting tools, this book is for
you. Here I cover the Brush and Pencil tools, along with the multi-faceted
Brushes palette. I also show you how to create vector shapes by using the
shape tools, and how to fill and stroke selections. 
Head to this book to find out how to create both gradients and patterns and,
last but not least, become familiar with the type tools and how to use them
to create and edit standard type, type on and in a path, and type with spe-
cial effects.
Book V: Working with Layers
Layers are an integral component in a Photoshop image, and Book V is
where I explain them. In this book, you discover how to create and edit
layers and how to use multiple images to create a multilayered composite

What’s in This Book

image. You find out various ways to manage layers for maximum efficiency,
including using the Layer Comps palette. I also show you how to enhance
layers by applying different blend modes, opacity settings, layer styles, and
styles. I round out the chapter by covering Smart Objects. And finally, I
introduce you to working with the new Auto Align and Auto Blend features.
Book VI: Channels and Masks
This book gives you all the how-tos you need to work with channels and
masks. I show you how to save and edit selections as alpha channels so that
you can reload them later. And I show you how to work with the various
kinds of masks — quick masks, layer masks, and channel masks — and how
you can use each to select difficult elements. I also cover other masking
techniques, such as erasing and using the Color Range command.
Book VII: Filters and Distortions
I filled this book with tons of handy tips and techniques on using filters 
to correct your images to make them sharper, blurrier, cleaner, and
smoother — whatever fits your fancy. I’ll give you the scoop on the new
Smart Filters feature where you can apply filters non-destructively. You also
find out how to use filters to give your image a certain special effect, such
as a deckled edge or water droplets. Finally, I introduce the Liquify com-
mand so that you can see the wonder of its distortion tools — and how 
they can turn your image into digital taffy. 
Book VIII: Retouching and Restoration
You find everything you need to know about color correction or color
enhancement in Book VIII — getting rid of colorcasts, improving contrast
and saturation, remapping, and replacing colors.
In addition, I include a chapter on using the focus and toning tools to manu-
ally lighten, darken, smooth, soften, and sharpen areas of your image. You
get to see how you can use the Clone Stamp tool, the Healing tools and the
Red Eye tool to fix flaws and imperfections in your images, making them
good as new. I also show you the Color Replacement tool and how to
replace your image’s original color with the foreground color. Finally, you
get some tidbits on how to work with the fascinating Vanishing Point fea-
ture, which can make editing and compositing images a whole lot easier.
Book IX: Photoshop and Print
This book gives you the lowdown on preparing your images for print. 
You find details on how to get the right resolution, image mode, and file
format. You also discover how to set up both process and sport color

separations for those offset print jobs. For good measure, I also throw in a
chapter on creating contact sheets and picture packages from your digital
masterpieces. 
About the Web Site
For those Web graphics, you find lots of great material on this book’s com-
panion Web site (www.dummies.com/go/photoshopcs3). Find out how to
optimize your images for maximum quality and quick download times. You
also find information on slicing and animating your images and creating a
photo gallery that you can easily post on the Web. 
Conventions Used in This Book
You’ll find that this book is cross-platform. Windows commands are given
first, followed by Mac commands in parentheses, like this:
Press Enter (or Return on the Mac) to begin a new line.
And occasionally, text is specific to one platform or another. You’ll find that
figures are divided into both platforms as well.
Often the commands given involve using the keyboard along with the mouse.
For example, “Press Shift while dragging with the Rectangular Marquee tool to
create a square,” or “Alt+click (Option+click) on the eyeball to redisplay all
layers.”
When you see a command arrow (➪) in the text, it indicates to select a com-
mand from the menu bar. For example, “choose Edit➪Define Custom Shape”
means to click the Edit menu and then choose the Define Custom Shape
command.
This book has been written using Photoshop CS3 and, more specifically, the
Regular, Standard or Non-Extended version (not certain what Adobe is label-
ing it as of yet). Despite that fact, you can still glean valuable info if you’re
using Version CS2 or CS. It may take a little more time to understand how a
palette or options have changed, and of course, the topics covering new 
features won’t be applicable. Speaking of new features, when writing this
book, it wasn’t exactly crystal clear what new CS3 features Adobe would be
including in the regular versus extended versions of Photoshop. So if I’ve
included (or not) a particular tool or command that you don’t have, my
apologies in advance.

Icons Used in This Book
While perusing this book, you’ll notice some icons beckoning you for your
attention. Don’t ignore them; embrace them! These icons point out fun,
useful, and memorable tidbits about Photoshop, plus facts you’d be unwise
to ignore.
Seasoned users will appreciate this icon, which kindly points out new fea-
tures introduced in Photoshop CS3.
This icon indicates information that makes your Photoshop experience
easier. It also gives you an icebreaker at your next cocktail party. Whipping
out, “Did you know that pressing the bracket keys enlarges or shrinks your
brush tip?” is bound to make you the center of conversation.
This icon is a reminder of things that I already mentioned and want to
gently re-emphasize. Or I might be pointing out things that I want you to
take note of in your future Photoshop excursions.
The little bomb icon is a red flag. Heed these warnings, or else Photoshop
may show its ugly side.
This icon marks eggheady graphics or Photoshop info that goes beyond the
basics.
This icon points to related content you’ll find on this book’s companion
Web site, which you can find at www.dummies.com/go/photoshopcs3.

Photoshop
Fundamentals

D
on’t know where to start? Well, unless you
have a burning question on something very
speciﬁc, this is a great place to dive in. And I
promise you won’t ﬂounder. There’s nothing like
a general overview to get you feeling conﬁdent
enough to tackle more sophisticated features.
In this book, I introduce you to the Photoshop
environment with all its components, from the
desktop to the many palettes. I show you each of
the 59 tools and brieﬂy explain what each tool
does. From there, I show you how to open existing
ﬁles or create new ones and then how to save and
print those ﬁles, as well as how to view and navi-
gate around your image window. In that same
chapter, I give you details on using Adobe Bridge,
a powerful browser and ﬁle management tool.
Finally, I explain how to customize your workspace
and preferences so you can tailor Photoshop to
better suit your personal image-editing needs and
interests. I guarantee you won’t ﬁnd a more
accommodating image editor around.

A
s environments go, the Photoshop working environment is pretty cool:
as inviting as a landscaped backyard and not nearly as likely to work
you into a sweat. Each of the many tools in Photoshop is custom-
designed for a specific chore — and chock-full of more options
than a Swiss Army knife. When you’re familiar with your
surroundings, you’ll be eager to make like Monet in his
garden, surrounded by palettes, brushes, buckets of
paint, and swatches of color, ready to tackle the
canvas in front of you.
Launching Photoshop and 
Customizing the Desktop
You start Photoshop just as you launch any other
program with Windows or the Mac OS. As with other
programs, you can choose the method you find the easi-
est and most convenient. In Windows, you can launch pro-
grams from the Start menu or an icon on the taskbar. In Mac OS
X, you may have a Photoshop icon on the Dock. In either Windows or Mac
OS X, you can double-click a Photoshop shortcut or alias icon if you have
one on your desktop. Finally, you can double-click an image associated with
Photoshop, which then launches Photoshop along with the file.

Launching Photoshop and Customizing the Desktop
10
When you launch Photoshop, the desktop workspace, shown in Figure 1-1,
appears. Like the real-world desktop where your keyboard and monitor
reside, the Photoshop desktop is a place for you to put all the images you’re
working with.
Figure 1-1: The Photoshop desktop consists of many components, 
including an image document window, palettes, and bars.
Within the main Photoshop window, you see a variety of other windows and
boxes, such as the image document window that enables you to view and
edit images. The main window contains the stuff you’re probably used to
seeing in other programs — a title bar at the top of the window, a status bar
at the bottom (unless you have it turned off) if you’re a Windows user, and
menus to help you execute commands and get important information about
your image files. But the arrangement of controls may be a little unfamiliar
to you. Photoshop arranges controls into groups called palettes.
Your virtual desktop can become as cluttered as the real thing, but Adobe
has built in some special features (located on the Options bar, which I dis-
cuss later in this chapter) that let you keep stuff close at hand but tuck
things away so they’re not constantly underfoot (or undermouse, so to
speak). After you arrange your Photoshop desktop just as you like it for a
specific project, you can even save the desktop and reuse it whenever you
work on that project (see Book I, Chapter 5 for details).

Every document you ever work on appears within the confines of the image
document window and can’t leave its borders. You can move around some
other components, such as the various palettes and the Options bar, both
inside and outside the Photoshop
application window.
Windows users can close, minimize,
and restore the main Photoshop
window, just as you can with most win-
dows in other programs. Mac users can
choose Photoshop➪Hide Photoshop.
To display Photoshop again, simply
click the icon on the Mac OS Dock.
The Photoshop window hides one cool
secret for Windows users: If you double-
click anywhere in the gray empty area,
the Open dialog box pops up — so you
can navigate to a file you want to work
on without wandering up to the File
menu, using the Ctrl+O keyboard short-
cut, or using Adobe Bridge.
The following sections show you how
to customize the main working area so
you can get to work.
Setting display settings
with the Window menu
The Window menu, shown in Figure
1-2, controls the display of palettes
and some other elements of the
Photoshop working area. (Find out
more about maneuvering palettes later
in this chapter.)
The top two entries on the Window
menu enable you to control the display
arrangement of your open documents
and manage your workspaces. On the
Window➪Arrange submenu, you can
tell Photoshop to cascade (stack) or
tile (butt them edge to edge) all open
documents. Table 1-1 gives you the
lowdown about the other options on
the Window➪Arrange submenu.

On the Window➪Workspace submenu, you can save your current desktop
arrangement, load or delete a stored arrangement, or reset your palette
locations. 
You can also load preset workspace setups designed for specific workflows.
(For step-by-step instructions, see Book I, Chapter 5.) 
The remaining bulk of the Window menu contains a list of palettes in alpha-
betical order.

What It Does
Match Zoom
Takes all your open documents and matches the magnification per-
centage of your currently active document. 
Match Location
Takes all your open documents and matches the location of your
currently active document. For example, if you’re viewing the lower-
left corner of your active document and choose Match Location, all
your open documents are also displayed from the lower-left corner. 
Match Zoom 
Employs both commands simultaneously.
and Location
New Window
Opens another view of the same image, allowing you to work on a
close-up of part of the image while viewing results on the entire
image. 
Arrange Icons 
Takes minimized files and arranges the title bar icons in a neat row 
(Windows only)
directly above the status bar.
Minimize 
Hides the image while placing the image’s thumbnail on the Dock. 
(Mac only)
Click the thumbnail to restore the image in Photoshop. 
Bring All to 
If you have multiple applications launched and document windows 
Front (Mac only) 
open, this command brings all Photoshop documents to the front,
ahead of any open document windows from other applications.
Setting up the status bar
Each Photoshop document window comes equipped with a status bar. Many
people tend to associate status with wealth, so I think there’s a good reason
to accept the free wealth of information that the status bar offers:
 At the far left is a box that displays an active image’s current zoom level
(such as 33.33%). Incidentally, the title bar of the document itself also
shows the zoom level.

Launching Photoshop and Customizing the Desktop

If you installed Photoshop to a networked computer and you activate
the workgroup features, which enable file sharing and other perks, you
see the icon for the Workgroup Services pop-up menu just to the right of
the zoom-info box.
 Next is the display area for file and image information — which, by
default, shows the document size. (You can customize this area to dis-
play other information.) Click the size value to display a preview of how
your image fits on your selected paper size.
Because Photoshop files can get pretty hefty in size, your status bar shows
the file size of the active image by default. To display other types of informa-
tion, click the right-pointing arrow in the status bar, slide down to Show, and
select one of the following options from the menu that pops up (as shown in
Figure 1-3).
 Versions: If you are a Version Cue user, you can select this option, which
allows you to select other versions of your file. For example, you may
want to select a version with comments or one with a specific version
date. Versions provide a good way of storing work that was executed in
different stages. At each progress point, you can save a version of that
file, thereby creating a snapshot of the file at that point in time.
 Reveal in Bridge: This command transports you to the Adobe Bridge —
where it then physically locates your active image, wherever it resides
on your system.
 Version Cue: If you have Version Cue enabled, Photoshop displays
Version Cue information, such as if another user is using the file. What’s
Version Cue? It is a program (which works across all CS3 applications)
designed to increase productivity in a collaborative environment.
Version Cue identifies and organizes files into projects. You can have
various versions and alternates of the same project file. It also provides
file security, file status, and allows for commenting by multiple users.
 Document Sizes: When you select this option, Photoshop displays two
numbers to approximate the size of the image. The first number shows
you the size of the file if you were to flatten (combine) all the layers into
one and save it to your hard drive. The number on the right shows the
size of the file, including layers, channels, and other components, and
how much data Photoshop has to juggle while you’re working on the
file. You want this option active when you need to keep track of how
large your image is.

Figure 1-3: The status bar provides a wealth of vital information about your image.
 Document Profile: When you select this option, the status bar displays
the name of the color profile that the image uses. You probably won’t
use this option unless you need to know the profiles of all the open doc-
uments while making complex color corrections. (You can find more
information about profiles in Book II, Chapter 3.)
 Document Dimensions: When you select this option, the status bar
shows you the size of the image by using the default measurement
increment you’ve set in Photoshop’s Preferences (pixels, inches, picas,
and so on). You might need this for instant reference to the physical
dimensions of your open files. For information on setting preferences in
Photoshop, see Book I, Chapter 5.

 Scratch Sizes: Scratch space is the virtual memory set aside on your
hard drive to simulate RAM and make editing large files easier. Enabling
this option shows two measurements for an active image. On the left,
you see the amount of real memory and virtual memory that all open
images are using. On the right, you see the total amount of RAM avail-
able for working with images. Photoshop needs a lot more memory and
disk space to work on an image while it’s open, and that’s what’s shown
by the Scratch Sizes display, as opposed to the Document Size display
that shows only the file size of the document itself.
 Efficiency: This indicator helps you gauge whether you really have
enough RAM to perform a task. It shows the percentage of time Photo-
shop spends actually working on an operation, compared to the time it
must spend reading or writing image information to or from your hard
disk. If the value dips below 100 percent most of the time, you need to
allocate more memory to Photoshop (if you’re using a PC). For more
information on parceling out RAM, see Book I, Chapter 5.
 Timing: This number shows you how long it took you to complete your
most recent incredible feat.
 Current Tool: This option shows you the name of the tool currently 
in use.
 32-bit Exposure: This option is for adjusting the preview image for view-
ing 32-bit High Dynamic Range (HDR) images. The slider control is only
available if you have an HDR image open.
Playing with Palettes
Many image-oriented programs use palettes of a sort, and Photoshop itself
has had palettes since version 1.0 (released in January 1990). However,
since Photoshop 3.0, the program has used a novel way of working with
palettes. Instead of standalone windows, Photoshop uses grouped, tabbed
palettes, which overlap each other in groups of two or three (or more, if you
rearrange them yourself). To access a palette that falls behind the one dis-
played on top, click the palette’s tab. By default, some palettes, such as
Layer Comps and Tool Presets appear alone.
Palettes may contain sliders, buttons, drop-down lists, pop-up menus (as
shown in Figure 1-4), and other controls. You also find icons at the bottom of
many palettes. For example, at the base of the Layers palette are command
icons that let you create a new layer, add a layer style, or trash a layer that
you no longer want. Many palettes — such as the Brushes, Styles, Actions,
and Colors palettes — include options for defining sets of parameters
(called presets) that you can store for reuse at any time.

Figure 1-4: Palettes contain various types of icons for commands for editing and 
managing your image.
Adobe revamped the look and feel of palettes across all of their Creative
Suite applications, where they now refer to them as icon panels. That is,
except in Photoshop. While they exist in Photoshop, they’re still referred to
as palettes within the application. Whatever name you call them, they still
hold the same information. They’re just more streamlined and can be easily
tucked away and expanded as needed. By default, the palettes are anchored
in the top right by a multi-tiered Dock.

Here’s how to open, close, and otherwise manipulate a palette group from
the Window menu:
 To bring a palette to the front of its group: When the palette group is
open, the palette that’s visible is the palette that has a check mark next
to it on the Window menu. In this mode, you can select only one palette
in any group because only one tab in a group can be on top at one time.
When you select a palette from the Window menu, you have no way of
knowing which palettes are grouped together because Adobe lists
palettes alphabetically instead of by groups.
 To move a palette out of its group: Grab the palette’s tab and drag to its
new location, such as another group, into the Dock, or the Photoshop
desktop. If you move the palettes out of their groups or drag them onto
the desktop so they stand alone, any of them can be check-marked.
 To close a palette: Select a check-marked palette under the Window
menu or click the Close button at the top of the palette. Note that the
whole palette group closes.
 To access a palette from the desktop: Find its group and click the
palette’s tab to bring it to the front.
Here are some more palette-manipulation tips:
 Expand or collapse the Dock. To do so, click on the double triangles at
the top of the Dock.
 Palettes are now represented by icons when collapsed. To expand a
palette, simply click on its icon.
 Reduce a palette to its icon. Drag the palette by its tab and position it
under the existing column of icons. Release your mouse and the palette
should collapse down to its corresponding icon.
 Save space by keeping palettes in groups. You can drag all the palettes
in a group by dragging the group’s bar. Access an individual palette by
clicking its tab to bring it to the front. As a result, several palettes
occupy only the screen space required by one.
 Use the Window menu if you can’t find a palette. On the Window
menu, select the palette’s name to make it visible or to bring it to the
top of its group.
 Rearrange groups by dragging. If you’d like to move a palette to another
group or to display it as a standalone palette, drag and drop its tab.
 Customize, customize, customize. After you use Photoshop for a while,
creating your own custom palette groups based on the palettes you
most often use can be a real timesaver. For example, if you don’t use the
Book I

Paths palette very often but can’t live without the Actions palette, you
can drag the Paths palette to another group or the Palette Well and put
the Actions palette in the same group as the mission-critical Layers and
Channels palettes.
 Minimize palettes to save even more space. You can click a palette’s
bar (or tab if you’re using the Mac OS) to shrink the palette or palette
group down to its bar and tabs alone. You can also click the Minimize
button at the top of palette.
 Restore default palette locations when desired. If you decide you don’t
like the way you’ve arranged your palettes, you can choose Window➪
Workspace➪Reset Palette Locations to return them to the default config-
uration (the way they were when Photoshop was installed).
Many palettes (for example, the Swatches and Character palettes) allow you
to reset the settings back to their defaults. To do so, select Reset from the
palette’s pop-up menu located in the top-right corner.
Working with Your First Photoshop File
So many menus, so little time! The second you begin working with Photo-
shop, you may be convinced that Adobe’s flagship image editor has some-
where on the order of 8,192 different menu selections for you to choose from.
In truth, Photoshop has only about 500-plus separate menu items, including
some that are duplicated. That figure doesn’t count the 100 or so entries for
filter plug-ins (which can expand alarmingly as you add third-party goodies).
However, even 500-plus menu items are considerably more than you find in
the most ambitious restaurants. Basically, if you want to do something in
Photoshop, you need to use the menu bar (or its equivalent command snug-
gled within a palette menu). If you’re using the Mac OS, the Photoshop menu
bar may share space with Finder components (such as the Apple menu).
The following sections offer a summary of what you can find and where you
can find it.
Photoshop also helps you by providing efficient context menus, which
change their listings depending on what you’re doing. You don’t see options
you don’t need, and do see options appropriate to what you’re working on.
Right-click (Ctrl+click on the Mac) to bring up the menu.
Opening, printing, and saving files
The File menu offers a cornucopia of file options, from opening new images
and opening saved files to browsing existing files, closing files, and saving
files. You find the page setup, preview, and printing commands, too. To open

Working with Your First Photoshop File

a file, choose File➪Open and navigate to the folder containing the file you
want to open. Select the file and click Open. For detailed instructions on all
the many different ways you can open files, see Book I, Chapter 3.
Making selections
Selections let you work with only part of an image. You can choose an entire
layer or only portions of a layer that you select with one of the selection
tools, such as the Marquee or Magic Wand tools. The Select menu offers sev-
eral commands to modify your selection — from capturing more pixels to
softening the edges of the selection. The Select menu (shown in Figure 1-5)
is short and sweet, but the capability and control that the menu unleashes
is nothing short of an image-editing miracle.
Understanding selections is such an important cornerstone to your Photo-
shop knowledge that I devote an entire book (Book III) to showing you how
to use them.
Figure 1-5: The Select menu offers commands for making, modifying, saving, and loading your
selections.
Book I
Chapter 1
Examining the

Environment

Working with Your First Photoshop File

Making simple image edits
The Edit menu contains tools that enable you to cut, copy, or paste image
selections in several different ways. You can fill selections or stroke their
outlines (create a line along their edges), which I explain in more detail in
Book IV, Chapter 2. And you can use this menu to rotate, resize, distort, or
perform other transformations (changes in size or shape) on your selec-
tions (see Book III, Chapter 3). You can undo the change you made in
Photoshop, fade a filter, check your spelling, or find and replace text.
Adjusting size, color, and contrast
You’d think the Image menu (shown in Figure 1-6) might have something to
do with making changes to an image document as a whole, wouldn’t you? In
practice, some of the entries you find here do apply to the whole document,
but others can apply just to particular layers or selections.
For example, the Mode menu item allows you to change an entire image
from color to grayscale. The Image Size, Canvas Size, Rotate Canvas, Crop,
and Trim selections all change the whole document in some way. On the
other hand, you can only apply the changes wrought from the Adjustments
submenu to an entire image if the document consists of only a background
and has no layers. If the document has more than one layer, then adjust-
ments such as Color Balance, Hue/Saturation, or Levels work only with a
single layer or a selection on that layer.
The Variables and Apply Data Set commands are reserved for working with
data-driven graphics. Briefly, data-driven graphics make it possible to
quickly produce multiple versions of an image for print and Web projects.
Multiple versions allow for target audience customization for projects such
as direct mail pieces. For example, you can base hundreds of versions of a
brochure or Web banner on a single template. The Variables define which
elements in a template change. A Data Set is a collection of variables and
associated data. 
You’ll find yourself turning to the Image menu more often than many of the
other menus, partially because it’s so useful, and partially because, for
some reason, many of the options don’t have keyboard shortcuts that let
you bypass the menu.
Creating layers
Layers give you a way of stacking portions of an image — like sheets of
acetate — on top of one another so that you can work on individual pieces
separately. Then, when you’re satisfied with your changes, you can either
combine the changes into a final image or leave them in layers for maximum
editing flexibility.

Working with Your First Photoshop File
21
Figure 1-6: The important Image menu is where you find commands for adjusting the size,
color, and contrast of your image.
The Photoshop Layers feature, which gets an entire book of its own (Book V),
lets you create new and duplicate layers, delete one or several layers, change
layer properties (such as a layer’s name), or add special features, such as
drop shadows or beveled edges, to objects in a layer. You can also create
special kinds of layers to make adjustments or mask out portions of an
image. The menu has selections for changing the order of the layers (moving
a specific layer to the front or top of the stack, and so on) and grouping
layers. Figure 1-7 shows an image that has three layers: The first layer is the
symphony image, the second layer is the instrument, and the third layer
contains the type.

PhotoSpin
Figure 1-7: Layers enable you to easily edit elements individually in your document.
You also can merge layers down, combine them with all other visible layers,
or flatten them into one single-layer image (or background). Although con-
solidating your layers makes the file smaller, flattening is irreversible after
you close the file. Storing an unflattened version of a file is always a good
idea in case you want to make more changes later on.
Applying filters
A filter is an effect that changes an entire layer, channel, or selection. Some
common filters include the Blur and Sharpen filters as well as the Distort fil-
ters, such as Spherize. The Filter menu, shown in Figure 1-8, consists almost
entirely of cascading categories of image-transmogrifying plug-ins. You can
wade through this menu to find the perfect effect to apply to an image or
selection. Book VII has everything you need to know about filters.

Working with Your First Photoshop File
23
Figure 1-8: The Filter menu is bursting at the seams with plug-ins to improve, enhance, or
completely transform your image.
After you apply a filter, Photoshop copies the filter command to the top of
the Filter menu for easy accessibility in case you want to reapply the filter
with the exact same settings.
The Filter Gallery command allows you to apply several filters simultane-
ously in one neat editing window. 
Extract, Liquify, Pattern Maker, and Vanishing Point are more like mini-pro-
grams than filters. The rest of the Filter menu consists of 14 different filter
categories, each containing from two to a dozen or more options:
 Single-step filters are pretty basic to use but can make a huge impact on
an image. These include simple filters such as the Blur, Facet, and Clouds
filters. Just select each filter to apply it; it has no options to choose.
Book I
Chapter 1
Examining the

Environment

24
 Dialog box-based filters let you choose options galore. These filters
come complete with preview windows, buttons, slider controls, and
menus. You can distort, pixelate, sharpen, stylize, apply textures, and
perform other functions with these filters.
 CS3 introduces us to Smart Filters. If you convert your layer to a Smart
Object, you can then apply a Smart Filter. A Smart Filter is smarter
because it doesn’t alter your image pixels, but merely “hovers” above it,
thereby allowing you to re-edit, or even remove, the filter if need be. For
the scoop on this cool (and very useful) new feature, see Book VII,
Chapter 1.
If you install additional filters from third parties, Photoshop lists them at the
very bottom of the Filter menu. You can find third-party filters at Web sites
such as www.alienskin.com, www.andromeda.com, and www.autofx.com.
Simplifying your edits with the Options bar
The Options bar, shown in Figure 1-9, is a great feature because it eliminates
the need to access a separate options palette for each tool. The bar remains
available at all times, docked beneath the menu bar (unless you decide to
hide it for some bizarre reason), and the options change as you switch
tools. If under the menu isn’t a good place for it, feel free to move it any-
where you please.
Because the Options bar changes its appearance with each active tool, I
can’t explain all the components you might find there, but all Options bars
do have some characteristics in common:
 Gripper bar: Grab this little bar, on the far left, and drag to undock or
dock the Options bar at the top or bottom of the Photoshop window.
You can also let the Options bar float anywhere in the working space.
 Tool options: This box displays the icon of the currently active tool and
may include some options for that tool.
 Options pop-up menu: The Options bar may have a pop-up menu that
includes a selection of brush tips (for painting and erasing tools), a
flyout-type options menu that lets you select presets (saved settings) for
various tools, and additional options to set, such as the size of the icons
used to represent brush tips. You may also reset a particular tool — or
all tools — to the Photoshop default values.
 Bar options: Additional options, such as mode, opacity, feather, type
styles, and fonts are arrayed on the rest of the Options bar.
 Adobe Bridge button: The Adobe Bridge button (a folder with a magni-
fying glass and the letters Br) allows you to access the cross application
Bridge with a mere click. See Book I, Chapter 4 for lots of details.

Figure 1-9: The ubiquitous Options bar is dynamic and reflects various options for the tool in
use and operation being performed.
 Workspace: Click the down-pointing arrow to find a trimmed down ver-
sion of the Window Workspace submenu. (For the lowdown on work-
spaces, see Book I, Chapter 5.)
Viewing and navigating the image
A hodgepodge of functions is sprinkled throughout the View menu. Some of
them, such as Proof Setup, Proof Colors, and Gamut Warning, won’t trouble
you until you’ve become a fairly advanced Photoshop user. For new Photo-
shop users, the various commands to zoom into and out of the image are
likely the most familiar. You can also choose your screen mode, which lets
you view your image full-screen with the menu bar and palettes, or full-
screen with just palettes.

You’re better off accessing some functions, especially the zoom features,
through keyboard shortcuts. See Book I, Chapter 5 for details.
From the View menu, you can select
which extras Photoshop displays. You
can choose to see (or hide) the follow-
ing, as shown in Figure 1-10:
 Layer Edges: Displays a blue
stroked box that surrounds the
boundaries of the content of the
selected layer.
 Selection Edges: Moving lines that
define the boundary of a selection
and are very useful for obvious
reasons.
 Target Path: Lines and curves that
define a shape or are used to
select part of an image. You defi-
nitely want to see them if they
need editing.
 Grids and Guides: Lines that dis-
play on-screen and are great when
you’re aligning selections, objects,
or other components, and potentially distracting when you’re not.
 Count: Bulleted numbers indicating your counted elements will display.
As of the writing of this book, Adobe was considering the Count feature
to be in the Extended version only.
 Smart Guides: Smart Guides enable you to precisely position and align
layer content and only appear when needed.
 Slices: Rectangular pieces of an image to which you can optimize or
apply Web features. If you slice the image, you probably want to view
the results.
 Annotations: On-screen notes and audio annotations that you can
create and view (or play). Annotations can sometimes be confusing,
unless you’re already confused; then annotations can help you sort out
what’s what.
The View menu holds the controls for turning on and off the snap feature in
Photoshop. (The snap feature makes objects magnetically attracted to grids,
guides or other objects.) You can also create new guides, lock and clear slices
(see Bonus Chapter 2 for slice-and-dice information), and turn rulers on or off.
Figure 1-10: Viewing and navigating your
image are the main tasks on the View
menu.

A
fter you have a good grasp of the overall Photoshop environment
(described in Book I, Chapter 1), you’re ready to dive into the cache of
gadgets that — along with the menus, palettes, and dialog boxes — make it
all happen. Just as you can use a saw, hammer, and nails to transform a pile
of 2 x 4s into a garden gazebo, you can use the Lasso tool, Healing Brush,
and Smudge tool to convert a mediocre photo into a masterpiece
that’s fit to be framed. But remember, behind every garden
gazebo is a carpenter who knew how to use the tools
required to build it.
Turning On the Tools Palette
You can access the Tools palette by choosing
Window➪Tools. Here are a few tips for using the
Tools palette:
 To quickly hide and show the Tools palette
(along with the other palettes), press Tab.
 To move the Tools palette anywhere within the
Photoshop window, drag the title bar above the Ps icon.
By default, the Tools palette is now a single column. Miss the
two column version? No worries, just click the double triangle at the top of
the palette to display the two column configuration. 
Selecting tools
To select a tool, simply click it in the Tools palette. A small black triangle in
the bottom-right corner of a tool slot indicates that more tools are hidden
behind that tool on a flyout menu, shown in Figure 2-1. You can also access

Turning On the Tools Palette
28
tools by using keyboard shortcuts (which are listed in the Cheat Sheet at
the front of the book).
Figure 2-1: The Photoshop Tools palette offers 59 tools for your editing pleasure.

Turning On the Tools Palette
29
For the most part, you can access a hidden tool by pressing the Shift key
along with the keyboard letter of the visible tool. For example, to select
the Pencil tool, which shares the flyout menu with the Brush tool, press
Shift+B.
If you don’t like having to press the Shift key to access a hidden tool, choose
Edit➪Preferences➪General (Photoshop➪Preferences➪General on the Mac)
and deselect the Use Shift Key for Tool Switch option. You can then rotate
through the tools by pressing the same letter repeatedly.
When you hover your mouse pointer over a tool, color control, or icon, you
see a tool tip. The tool tip tells you the name of the tool or icon and its key-
board shortcut, if any. Although helpful at first, it can get annoying after a
while. Turn it off by deselecting the Show Tool Tips option in the Interface
section of the Preferences dialog box.
Getting to know your tools
The Tools palette is divided into three basic sections:
tools, color swatches, and icons for quick mask
mode and viewing options. The next several sections
introduce you to the tools. The following list details
the other residents of the Tools palette, shown in
Figure 2-2:
 Foreground Color and Background Color: Color
swatches represent the current foreground and
background colors. When using some of the tools
(such as the Brush or Pencil), you may apply either
of these colors. The small black-and-white swatches represent the
default colors. 
• Click the Default Colors icon to reset the colors to the default. 
• Click the curved arrow icon to switch the foreground and back-
ground colors. 
For everything you need to know about color, see Book II, Chapter 3.
 Edit in Quick Mask Mode: The default editing mode 
is Standard Mode. To edit in Quick Mask mode, click the icon. I cover
Quick Masks, which offer a way to view, make, and edit a selection, in
detail in Book VI, Chapter 2.
 Screen Modes: Now, tucked away in a flyout menu, these icons repre-
sent the various viewing modes in Photoshop. The default Standard
Screen Mode enables you to see your entire Photoshop desktop. The
new Maximized Screen mode maximizes your image window within the
Tools palette (on the left) and the palettes Dock (on the right). You can
also select Full Screen Mode with Menu Bar, which hides your desktop

background and other open images. Or click Full Screen Mode, to the
far right, to hide your desktop background, any open images, and the
menu bar. Note that you can also just click on the icon to cycle through
the various modes.
Introducing the Photoshop Tools
I’m just giving you a very brief description of what each tool does. You
become more thoroughly initiated with the use of each of the tools as you
go through the book. Don’t want to go page by page through the book?
Okay. Well, you’re in luck; I also give you the exact spot where you can find
more on each of the tools. For what it’s worth, I have organized the tools
into logical groupings — although some can cross over into other groups
and some are so unique that they don’t fit well in any group. 
Using selection tools
The selection tools are the workhorses of Photoshop. They allow you to
capture and isolate pixels so that you can edit or manipulate just a portion
of an image. Marquee tools capture rectangular, elliptical, or single rows 
or columns of pixels. Figure 2-3 shows an example of an elliptical selection.
Whereas the lasso tools make freeform selections, the Magic Wand tool 
creates selections by picking up pixels of similar colors. The new Quick
Selection tool enables you to “paint” your desired selection. And the 
Move and Crop tools do just what their names describe — move and crop
images. See Book III, Chapter 1 for details on all the selection tools but the
Move tool and Crop tool. You can find Move tool details in Book III, Chap-
ter 3, and Book V, Chapters 1 and 5. Crop-tool details reside in Book II,
Chapter 1.
Creating and modifying paths
The path tools create and modify paths, which are elements comprised of
straight and curved segments and anchor points. You can then use these
paths as a basis for a selection or to define a shape.
Because of their precision, using path tools to ultimately create a difficult
selection usually yields better results than you can achieve with the selec-
tion tools. 
The Path Selection and Direct Selection tools select your paths and path
components after you draw the path. Figure 2-4 shows examples of using
the Pen tool and Direct Selection tool, respectively. (For more on the Pen
tools, see Book III, Chapter 2.)

the Move tool (right) enables you to move a selection within your image.

Figure 2-4: The Pen tool creates a path made up of anchor points and segments; use 
the Direct Selection tool to select and manipulate those points and segments.
Using painting tools
The painting tools, in general, allow you to apply color or erase pixels. In the
case of the Gradient tool, you can apply multiple colors simultaneously. And
with the Art History Brush tool, you paint on a stylized effect rather than color.
The Color Replacement tool lets you replace the color of your image with the

foreground color. Figure 2-5 shows an
example of a heart drawn with the
Custom Shape tool, painted with a Spe-
cial Effects brush (left), and later (right)
partially erased with the Eraser tool. 
All the painting tools rely on the
Brushes palette for the size, shape,
texture, and angle for the tip of the
tool. See Book IV (Chapters 1 and 2)
for details on most of the painting
tools. You find an explanation of the
Eraser’s Erase to History option in Book II, Chapter 4.
Using tools for cloning and healing
The cloning and retouching tools are the powerhouse tools to break out
when you need to do some image repairs. These tools allow you to dupli-
cate portions of your image, paint with a pattern, or seamlessly fix
scratches, wrinkles, and other blemishes. The unique History Brush tool
lets you actually paint a previous version of your image back into your cur-
rent image — perfect for undoing mistakes.
The Spot Healing Brush quickly removes small blemishes and hickeys of all
kinds. The Red Eye tool removes the nasty red reflections in the eyes of
your loved ones, as shown in Figure 2-6. Be sure and check out Book VIII,
Chapter 3 for info on cloning and healing. You can find History Brush details
in Book II, Chapter 4. And for all you need to know about pattern stamping,
see Book VI, Chapter 2.

Creating effects with typographical tools
The type tools pretty much do what their moniker suggests — create type of
varying sorts. The Horizontal Type tool and Vertical Type tool create regular
old type, plus type on a path; the Mask
Type tools create selections in the
shape of letters — which you can then
fill with images, patterns, colors and 
so on. Figure 2-7 shows text created
using both the Horizontal Type and
Horizontal Type Mask tools. (For type
details, see Book IV, Chapter 3.)
Using focus and toning tools
The focus and toning tools allow you to enhance your image by altering the
pixels in various ways. You can lighten, darken, blur, smudge, sharpen, satu-
rate, or desaturate color in selected portions of your image.
These tools work best for touching up smaller areas rather than the entire
image. For example, in Figure 2-8, I used the Smudge tool to spike the groom’s
hair. (Hopefully he doesn’t take it personally.) To saturate the orange on the
right, I used the Sponge tool. See Book VIII, Chapter 2 for all you want to
know about focus and toning tools.

Creating shapes
The shape tools allow you to create vector-based elements in your image.
You can fill these elements with the foreground color or leave them as an
empty path.
Although vector-based elements are the heart and soul of the shape tools,
you can also create shapes filled with pixels of the foreground color. For
shape details, see Book IV, Chapter 1. For more on resolution, see Book II,
Chapter 1. Figure 2-9 shows the Custom Shape (left) and Rectangle and
Ellipse tools (right) in action.

Viewing, navigating, sampling, 
and annotating tools
Photoshop has an abundance of tools
to help you view and navigate your
image window. These tools allow you
to zoom in (as shown in Figure 2-10)
and out, move your image within the
window, and measure distances and
angles. The Eyedropper and Color
Sampler tools let you pick up and
sample color respectively — handy for
grabbing or evaluating color in an
image. The Notes tool and Audio
Annotation tool create written and
audio notes that you can leave in an
Figure 2-10: The Zoom tool enables you
to zoom in and out of your image.

image window — useful for collaboration purposes or simply for reminders
to yourself. (See Book II, Chapter 3 for more on the Eyedropper and Color
Sampler tools. For the lowdown on the Measure, Zoom, and Hand tools, see
Book I, Chapter 5.)
Bonus Chapter 3 covers the Notes and Annotation tools. See the
Introduction for details about this book’s companion Web site.
Using tools for the Web
Photoshop doesn’t have a whole lot of tools dedicated to the preparation of
Web images. That’s mainly because Adobe’s other programs Macromedia
Fireworks, Dreamweaver, and Flash take up the slack in that department.
In the Tools palette, you find the Slice tool and Slice Select tool, which
allow you to create and select slices. Slices are rectangular sections from
an image that you can optimize and turn into Web features. For example,
you might slice an image — and apply rollovers and image maps, in 
Dreamweaver, to those slices separately — for the best viewing experience
on your Web page. 
See Bonus Chapter 2 for all you need to know on slicing. The Introduction
has all the details about this book’s Web site.
Saving Time with Tool Presets
Tool presets enable you to create tool settings that you can save and use
again. Creating tool presets is a real timesaver if you use specific tool set-
tings on a frequent basis. For example, I make numerous 2×2-inch and 2×3-
inch rectangular selections on images I use in a newsletter. Because I saved
the settings as presets, I don’t have to redefine them each time I want to
select an image for my project.
Creating custom tool presets
Here are the short and simple steps for creating your own custom tool preset:
1. Choose the tool you want to create a preset for.
If a tool doesn’t allow for presets, such as the Ruler tool for example,
the New Tool Preset command will be grayed out.
2. Select the option you want for the tool on the Options bar.
For example, if you chose the Rectangular Marquee in Step 1, you may
want to choose Fixed Size from the Style pop-up menu, and then enter
your desired Width and Height values.

lthough you can create some interesting images from scratch in
Photoshop, most of the time you’ll be working with digital pictures
that already exist. These may be images captured by your scanner or
photos you’ve grabbed with your digital camera.
Photoshop offers you lots of different options for opening
existing images, creating new images, and saving original
files or copies to your hard drive. After you open, edit,
and save your files, you may want to transfer those
images from screen to paper. This chapter takes
you through the steps you need to know to get
your photos in and out of Photoshop.
Browsing for Files
If you don’t know the exact filename or location of
an image, you can use Adobe Bridge to search for and
open files. (Check out Book I, Chapter 4 for a complete
description of Bridge.) Finding a file is about as easy as
you might expect: Choose File➪Browse, or press Alt+Ctrl+O
(Option+Ô+O on the Mac). The Bridge window opens, as shown in
Figure 3-1.
You can also just click the Go to Bridge button, which looks like a folder and
magnifying glass, and is on the right side of the Options bar.

Opening an Image
40
Figure 3-1: Adobe Bridge allows you to efficiently search for your images.
To navigate to a folder you want to search, use the folder tree in the upper-
left corner of the window or click the Folder tab and locate your desired
folder from the list. Click an image in the lightbox area to see it in the Preview
window (which shows up on the right side of the Bridge). Photoshop 
graciously provides information about the file in the Metadata palette located
underneath the Preview.
When you find a file you’re sure you want to open, double-click it, or choose
File➪Open, or File➪Open With (and then choose your desired application)
on the Bridge menu.
Opening an Image
If you know where an image file is stored, you can open the file in a similar
way to opening a word processing, spreadsheet, or other file. Follow these
steps to open a file: 
1. Choose File➪Open, or press Ctrl+O (Ô+O on the Mac).
The standard Open dialog box for Windows or the Mac OS appears. The
layout of the dialog box differs slightly between the two. Figure 3-2
shows the Windows version, and Figure 3-3 the Mac version.

Opening an Image
41
Figure 3-2: Opening a file in Photoshop on a Windows PC.
When opening images you have the option of choosing between the stan-
dard OS (Operating System) or the Adobe dialog box. The Adobe dialog
box, shown in Figure 3-4, is like a pared-down mini Bridge, offering various
views and the ability to delete items and create folders. Project Tools 
(the Toolbox icon) enables you to select an item and see its location in
Explorer (Windows), the Finder (Mac OS), or in Bridge. You also have
access to certain metadata, such as filename, size, and creation dates.
Version Cue aficionados also have several tools to use.
2. Navigate to the folder that contains your file.
From the Files of Type list (Windows) or Enable list (Mac OS), you can
choose which types of files you want to display.
To view all image files, choose All Formats (Windows) or All Readable
Documents (Mac OS).
3. Click the name of the image file you want to open.
To select multiple files, click the first file and then Ctrl+click (Ô+click in
Mac OS X) each additional file.
You may see a preview of the image in the Open dialog box’s Preview
window.

4. After you select the file you want, click the Open button.
The file opens in Photoshop.
If you choose File➪Open Recent, a submenu lists the last files you
worked on. Click a filename to open it or simply type the number next to
the filename. You can define the number of files that appear on this menu
in the File Handling section of the Preferences dialog box. (For the low-
down on how to specify this value, jump ahead to Book I, Chapter 5.)
Opening special files
Photoshop needs to know the image format of a file (that is, whether it’s a
TIFF, PCX, PSD, or JPEG file, for example) before it can open the file. Photo-
shop uses different methods in Windows and Mac OS to determine the
format of an image file:
 In Windows, Photoshop looks at the file extension (.tif, .pcx, .psd,
and so forth), and if it finds a standard image-format extension, it
assumes that the file was saved using that format. 
Note that file extensions are hidden by default in Windows XP and Vista.
You, like many other users, may have changed the default to display file
extensions.
 The Mac OS X uses a similar system based on filename extensions. File
extensions may or may not be hidden in the Mac OS. Showing or hiding
file extensions can be accomplished via any file’s Info dialog box. Select
the file in the Mac OS X Finder, press Ô+I, and the Info dialog box pops
up. Here you can show or hide the extension for that file, and change
what application is associated with that file (and all files with the same
extension). 

Opening an Image
43
Figure 3-4: The Adobe dialog box acts like a mini Bridge.
For compatibility reasons, Macintosh applications such as Photoshop usually
use the Windows file extension. However, when you move files from one plat-
form to the other, they can easily be misidentified. With Photoshop’s Open As
feature, you can specify the format that you think (or know) a given file uses.
This facility works slightly differently in Windows than in the Mac OS.
Opening special files using the Windows OS
In Windows, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Open As and navigate to the file you want to open.
2. From the Open As drop-down list, choose the file format you want 
to use.
3. Double-click the file’s icon.
If you’ve chosen the right format, the file opens in Photoshop. If the file
doesn’t open, you may have chosen the wrong format. Choose another
and try again.

Opening as a Smart Object
44
Opening special files using the Mac OS
The standard Open dialog box includes an Enable option at the top. Choose
All Documents from the pop-up menu at the top. Then you can choose the
file format you’d like to try directly from the Format list. 
Opening as a Smart Object
Photoshop now enables you to open a file as a Smart Object. Choose File➪
Open as Smart Object to create a special layer that can contain both raster
and vector data. Smart Objects are beneficial in that they allow you to trans-
form and manipulate your image data non-destructively. (For details on
Smart Objects, see Book V, Chapter 5.)
Placing Files
In Photoshop, use File➪Place to put PDF (Portable Document Format), Adobe
Illustrator (AI), EPS (Encapsulated PostScript), PSD, JPEG, TIFF, BMP, GIF, PNG
(and several other lesser used formats) files into separate layers of their own.
These files are often created by programs other than Photoshop — such as
Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Illustrator, or acquired from your digital camera.
Although Photoshop can open these files independently, you can use the
Place feature if you want to combine them with an existing image.
Follow these steps to place a PDF, Adobe Illustrator, or EPS file:
1. Open an existing document into which you want to place a file.
2. Choose File➪Place.
The Place dialog box opens.
3. Navigate to the file you want to
insert and then double-click the
file.
If you are placing an Illustrator file,
make sure it was saved with PDF
Compatibility checked in the
Illustrator Options dialog box.
Otherwise it may not be placed.
For some types of files, such as
multipage PDF files, you may see a
dialog box like the one shown in
Figure 3-5, which lets you specify
Figure 3-5: Use the Place command
when importing a page from a multipaged
PDF into an existing file.

Creating a New Image
45
which page you want to place. You can also choose between the entire
Page or just a particular Image on the page. Finally, choose how much of
your image you want to place from the Crop to pop-up menu. The default
Bounding Box crops to the smallest area that includes text and graphics.
Photoshop automatically places PDFs, JPEGs, TIFFs, or PNGs as Smart
Objects. For more on Smart Objects, see Book V, Chapter 5.
Your image appears in a bounding box in the center of your Photoshop
image.
4. You can reposition the artwork by positioning your cursor inside the
bounding box and dragging. You can also transform (size, rotate, 
and so on) your placed artwork if you want — by dragging or rotating
the handles on the bounding box or by entering values on the
Options bar.
You don’t have to be concerned if your placed image is a Smart Object,
but be careful about sizing EPS images. If you enlarge your placed EPS
too much, you may degrade the quality of your image. For more infor-
mation on transforming images, see Book III, Chapter 3. Avoid this by
creating a smart object, which I explain in Book V, Chapter 5.
Note that when you place a file, you cannot edit the text or vector 
artwork in it. Why? Because Photoshop rasterizes the file, using the
resolution of the file into which you placed it. Note too that when art
is larger than the Photoshop image, Photoshop downsizes the art so
that it fits the image. See Book II, Chapter I for more on rasterizing and
resolution.
5. Choose Anti-Alias on the Options bar if you want to soften the edges
of the artwork during the transformation.
Not choosing the option produces a hard edge.
6. Double-click inside the bounding box to commit the placed image to a
new layer. You can also press Enter (Return on the Mac) or click the
Commit button (the check icon) on the Options bar.
Creating a New Image
At some point, you’ll want to create a new image from scratch. You may
want an empty canvas to paint on or need a blank image as scratch space.
Or you may want to paste a copied selection into a new document.
Follow these steps to use the New feature to create a new image:

1. Choose File➪New or press Ctrl+N
(Ô+N on the Mac).
The New dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 3-6.
2. Type a name for the new file.
If you specify no name, Photoshop
creates one for you, such as
Untitled-1, Untitled-2, and so forth.
3. If you want to create content for
mobile devices, such as a cell
phone, PDA or mini portable PC,
click the new Device Central button.
What follows is a quick, three-step process:
a. Specify your desired preferences by choosing Device Central➪
Preferences to specify your default Phone ID, language and fonts.
You may also specify your levels of Undo. 
b. Choose your desired device profile from the Device Sets list, as
shown in Figure 3-7.Click the tiny phone icon at the bottom of the
list to view the device sets via another sorting criteria. Click the
magnifying glass icon to search for a particular device. To load a
new device profile, choose Edit➪Install Device Profile Package.
Import entire new device sets, or check for updates under the
Devices menu. To see exactly what specs your profile contains, click
the Device Profile tab.
c. Choose the type of content you want to create, such as a full-screen
graphic or wallpaper. To create a custom size, check the Custom
Size option at the bottom and enter your desired dimensions. Click
Create and your new document, sized and ready for art, opens in
Photoshop.
If you want to preview how your content will look, preview it by choos-
ing File➪Save for Web & Devices. See Bonus Chapter 1 for details.
Note that you can also access the Device Central dialog box by choos-
ing File➪Device Central. And you’ll find the same command in both
Adobe Illustrator and Macromedia Flash.
4. Choose a preset image category from the Preset pop-up menu.
Choose from common categories such as U.S. Paper, Photo, Web,
Mobile and Devices, and Film and Video.
The Clipboard provides the size that corresponds with an image that
you have copied. 
• You can also choose to match the size of any open file. Open files
are listed at the bottom of the Preset list. 
Figure 3-6: Specify all your desired
options in the New dialog box.

• If you choose Custom, Photoshop also allows you to create a user-
defined custom preset based on your defined settings: Click the 
Save Preset button in the New Document Preset dialog box. Name
your preset. Choose any or all the options you want to include 
in your preset. When you choose not to include an option, Photoshop
displays the last used value for that option. Click OK. Your custom
preset now appears at the top of the Preset list.
Figure 3-7: Create content for mobile devices with the new Device Central.
5. If you chose an image category from the Preset menu in Step 3,
choose your desired preset size for that category.
6. If you chose Custom in Step 3, enter the width and height of your image
manually. Type the width and height of your choice in the text boxes. 
Note that any Preset sizes automatically revert to Custom, and that when
you change the units for either the width or height, the other also changes.
You press the Shift key to change both width and height independently.
As with other Photoshop dialog boxes, you may change from the default
unit of measurement of pixels to another, such as inches.
7. Enter the resolution for the new document.

Note that when you choose a Preset image category and size, the rec-
ommended resolution is entered for you. You can change this resolution
if desired but remember, choosing the right resolution at this point in
the creation process is important because if you need to change the
resolution later, you degrade image quality. (For more information on
selecting an appropriate resolution, see Book II, Chapter 1.)
Note that Photoshop gives you the size of your image file in the lower-
right of the dialog box based on your settings. This information is good
to know if you’re targeting a specific file size for your image.
8. From the Color Mode drop-down list, select a color mode.
Your choices include Bitmap, Grayscale, RGB Color, CMYK Color, and
Lab Color. 
9. Choose your desired color depth for your document.
Only one-bit color depth is available for bitmap images (each pixel is
either black or white). The 8-bit and 16-bit color depths are available for
the other color modes. And now you may also create a new 32-bit image
in RGB or Grayscale modes. For details on modes and color depths, see
Book II, Chapter 2.
10. In the Background Contents drop-down list, select an option for how
you want the background layer to be filled.
Your choices are white, the current background color, or transparent.
11. Click the Advanced button to display a couple of additional options. 
• Color Profile assigns a color profile (a definition of the way color
looks in a document) to your new document. The default, Adobe
RGB (1998), is fine when creating a new document unless you have
good reason not to otherwise. This setting provides a nice, large
gamut (range) of RGB colors.
• Pixel Aspect Ratio selects an aspect ratio (the relationship of width
to height). The default setting of Square is fine for print or Web
images. Images for digital video content may require a non-square
aspect ratio such as D1/DV NTSC or others.
12. Click OK when you finish entering your options.
Photoshop creates the new image.
Saving a File
Before you exit Photoshop, you’ll want to save your file on your hard drive
or other media. Don’t worry if you forget to do this; Photoshop won’t let
you exit without first asking you if you’d like to save any files that you’ve
changed or newly created. 

Saving a File
49
Saving files from time to time as you work on them is a good idea so you
always have a recent copy safely stored on your drive.
Follow these steps to save a file:
1. Choose File➪Save to store the current file with its present name.
Choose File➪Save As to store a file already saved with a different
name, or even a file with the same name but in a different location.
The dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-8.
Figure 3-8: Saving a file frequently is one of the smartest things 
you can do in Photoshop.
2. Navigate to the folder where you’d like to store the file.
3. Type a name in the File Name (Save As on the Mac) text box.
4. Choose a format from the Format drop-down list.
Some file formats have special capabilities and requirements. For details
on file formats, see Book II, Chapter 2.

5. In the Save and Color options areas, select or deselect (if available)
the following check boxes as desired:
• As a Copy: Save the file as a copy.
• Annotations: Include or delete annotations in the saved copy. (See
Bonus Chapter 3 for more on annotations. The Introduction has
details about this book’s bonus material on the Web.)
• Alpha Channels: Include or ignore alpha channels (stored selec-
tions). (See Book VI, Chapter 1 for a discussion of channels.)
• Spot Colors: Enable spot colors in the saved file. (For more informa-
tion on spot colors, see Book IX, Chapter 1.)
• Layers: Include layers or simply flatten the image to one layer. (See
Book V, Chapter 1 for the lowdown on layers.)
• Use Proof Setup: Enable proof setup, which includes an on-screen
preview of how the image will look when printed or viewed on a spe-
cific device. (See Book II, Chapter 3 for more information.)
• ICC Profile (Windows)/Embed Color Profile (Mac): Embed a color
profile in the file based on the settings established in your Color
Settings dialog box. Leave this value at the default setting, but check
out Book II, Chapter 3 for information on the specialized situations
when you might want to change it.
• Thumbnail (Windows only): Embed a thumbnail image in the file if
you’ve defined thumbnails as optional in Photoshop’s Preferences.
(You can find more on preferences in Book I, Chapter 5.)
• Use Lower Case Extension (Windows only): Use lowercase exten-
sions (that is, .tif instead of .TIF) regardless of how you type the
filename.
6. Depending on which file format you choose, you may get an addi-
tional dialog box of options.
For specifics on these file format options, see Book II, Chapter 2.
7. Click Save to store the image.
Closing and Quitting
When your session is finished, you’ll want to close up shop and quit
Photoshop. PC users, in addition to using the traditional File➪Exit option,
can close Photoshop in any of the following ways:
 Choose Close from the Windows Control menu in the upper-left corner
of the Photoshop title bar.

51
 Click the Close (X) button in the upper-right corner of the Photoshop
title bar under Windows.
 Press Ctrl+Q.
Mac users can choose Photoshop➪Quit Photoshop or press Ô+Q.
With any of these methods, Photoshop asks you, in turn, whether you want to
save any open file that has not been saved (or has not been saved since it was
modified in this session). Click the Yes button to close and save the files.
You can also close any open files without exiting Photoshop by pressing
Shift+Ctrl+W (Shift+Ô+W on the Mac).
You want to have a backup copy of an image safe on your hard drive prior to
an editing session. If you change your mind about the modifications you’ve
made to an image, you can always return to the backup copy. Choose
File➪Save As and enter a new name for the file. You can also select the As a
Copy check box and append the word “copy” to the current filename.

Hard-copy prints have become a hugely popular output option, thanks largely
to the swarm of sub-$200 photo-quality inkjet printers that are vying for your
discretionary dollars. Today, anyone can afford a printer capable of producing
sparkling prints from digital images. The chief problem is restraining the urge
to print everything in sight before your ink tank (and wallet) runs dry.
Actually, making the prints is only a minor puzzle, and one addressed in 
this section. You can print most images with just a few clicks. Most of the
advanced options I discuss in this chapter are needed only for special situa-
tions or specialized applications and are not discussed in detail; this section
covers only the basics. If you need more detailed information on printing,
see Book IX, Chapter 1.
Many photofinishers or service bureaus can make prints from your
Photoshop-edited images if you burn them to a CD, save them to a USB
Jump Drive, or upload them to an FTP site over the Internet. Vendors such
as Shutterfly (www.shutterfly.com) and MyPublisher (www.mypublisher.
com) offer prints of all sizes, calendars, and professionally printed and
bound photo books.
Taking a look at printers
You can print Photoshop images on any kind of printer — but aside from the
occasional 200-copy print run of black-and-white “Have You Seen This Kitty?”

posters, monochrome laser printers are not high on the list of favored
Photoshop output hardware.
More often, you’re choosing a full-color printer, probably an inkjet model,
but possibly other models (such as dye-sublimation, thermal-wax, solid-ink
or even color laser) as your printer. Although all these printers produce
roughly similar results, they do have some differences, as detailed in the 
following list:
 Inkjet printers: These printers paint the page by spraying a jet of ink
one dot at a time, under precision computer control. They produce
better results when used with photo paper designed especially for
inkjets. Inkjet printers generally provide excellent full-color output, but
the cost of consumables (ink and paper) can add up fast. 
 Dye-sublimation printers: These printers potentially offer better-look-
ing prints, but the printers and materials are more expensive than inkjet
printers. They use a continuous ribbon of color panels in a roll that is
the same width as the print, with each panel used only once. The print
head’s tiny heating elements can melt dots of dye over a range of 256
values to generate up to 16.8 million colors. 
 Thermal-wax printers and solid-ink printers: These printers use
blocks of wax or resin that are melted and sprayed directly onto a page.
These devices are commonly used in printing barcodes and labels for
clothing, autos and aircraft.
Printing an image
The process of printing an image in
Photoshop is slightly different in the
Windows and Mac OS operating sys-
tems. The chief differences are in the
Page Setup step, in which you select a
printer and choose orientation, paper
size, and other parameters. The next
few sections take a closer look at the
Page Setup dialog box in the two oper-
ating systems.
Page setup in Microsoft Windows
With Windows applications such as
Photoshop, you open the Page Setup
dialog box by choosing File➪Page
Setup or by pressing Shift+Ctrl+P. In
this dialog box (shown in Figure 3-9),
Figure 3-9: Set your desired paper size
and orientation in the Windows Page Setup
dialog box.

Getting It on Paper

you can select the paper size, orientation (portrait or landscape), and other
things — such as which paper tray to use.
Page setup in the Mac OS
Choose File➪Page Setup, or press
Shift+Ô+P. You can set the page size
and orientation, scaling, and additional
parameters, depending on your
printer, as shown in Figure 3-10.
In Mac OS X, you can also choose a
printer directly from the Print dialog
box just as you can in Windows. Also
in Mac OS X, if you’re connected
directly to a printer via the USB port,
the system automatically detects the
printer. If you’re on a network, select a
printer from the Printer list in the Print
dialog box.
Setting printing options
Photoshop has a couple printing modes to choose from, depending on how
much control you need and how much of a hurry you’re in. Here are your
options:
 Print One Copy is a quick way to print a hard copy using the default
settings.
 Print (Ctrl+P, or Ô+P on the Mac) opens a generous Print dialog box
that includes a Preview window and many options to choose from.
Adobe must have gotten wind that no one used the standard Print
dialog box, but instead gravitated toward the Print with Preview com-
mand. So in CS3 the old Print with Preview dialog box is now the default
Print dialog box. This dialog box is almost identical in Windows and
Mac operating systems as shown in Figure 3-11.
To set your print options, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Print.
The Print dialog box opens.
2. Choose your desired printer from the Printer drop-down list.
3. Specify the number of copies you would like.
4. Click the Page Setup button if you need to revisit that dialog box.

Note that in Windows Vista, this dialog box may look different than the

customized for your printer such as print quality, special effects and so
on. These vary from printer to printer, so be sure and consult your
printer’s instruction manual.
Note that you can now change your page orientation in the Print dialog
box. Click the Portrait or Landscape button under the Preview.
5. Use the Top and Left boxes in the Position area to indicate where you
want the image to appear on the page. To center the image, select the
Center Image check box.
6. If you aren’t centering your image, choose your desired unit of 
measurement.
7. If you want to scale the image up or down, choose the scale percent-
age and/or enter height and width values in the Scaled Print Size area.
This choice doesn’t change the physical dimensions of the image, just
the print size. But keep in mind that scaling up may give you a less-than-
optimum printout. Additional options include these:
• Scale to Fit Media: Sizes your image to fit on a particular paper size.
• Match Print Colors: Gives you a soft-proof in your Preview. For more
on soft proofs, see Book II, Chapter 3.
• Show Bounding Box: Places the handles around the image area and
allows for visual sizing.
• Print Selected Area: Allows you to print only part of a large image.
Note that your document’s resolution is now displayed as well.
8. Choose Output from the drop-down list located in the top right.
The other option on the drop-down list, Color Management, controls
advanced proofing and color-profile tasks. (Check out Book IX, Chapter 1
for information on printing using color management, as well as Book II,
Chapter 3 for more detail on general color-management topics.)
9. Choose the Output printing options you want to apply:
• Background: The area surrounding the printed image is called the
background, not to be confused with the background color on the
Colors palette or the background layer of an image. You can change
this color from the default (white) to any other color.
• Border: The dialog box that pops up lets you add a black border
around an image in any width from 0 to 10 points, 0 to 3.5 millime-
ters, or 0 to 1.5 inches.
• Bleed: A bleed is an image that extends right up to the edge of the
paper size on one or more edges. In effect, you’re cropping inside
Book I
Chapter 3
Starting, Finishing,
and Getting 
It on Paper

Getting It on Paper
56
the image area. In practice, most printers don’t actually print right
to the edge, so to bleed, say, a 5-x-7-inch image, you need to print it
on a larger sheet of paper, such as 8 x 10. Clicking the Bleed button
opens a dialog box in which you enter a width in inches, millimeters,
or points inside the edge of the image.
• Screen: When you click the Screen button, you see the Halftone
Screens dialog box that lets you create halftones for color separation.
See Book IX, Chapter 1 for more information on color separations.
• Transfer: This is an advanced function used for prepress operations
to compensate for the change in dot sizes when halftone images are
printed on a press. Leave this at the default setting unless your serv-
ice bureau or offset print representative tells you otherwise.
• Interpolation: This option is only available with some printers, par-
ticularly PostScript Level 2 (or higher models), to even out the
jagged appearance of diagonal lines. Just be aware that interpolation
can only help so much and in some cases, it can be damaging. For
more on interpolation, see Book II, Chapter 1. 
10. Select options for marking the area outside the print area. These
include several items that appear only when the print area is smaller
than the paper size:
• Calibration Bars: This option adds an 11-step grayscale bar outside
the image area when printing to a paper size that is larger than the
image area. You can use cali-
bration bars to gauge how
accurately the gray tones of an
image are being reproduced.
• Registration Marks:
Registration marks are handy
when you’re printing with 
multiple plates for color 
separations, such as those
used in four-color or duotone
processes. These marks help
keep the plates aligned so the
image is printed properly.
• Corner Crop Marks: Clicking
this box prints crop marks 
at the corners of the image,
which indicate where trimming
should take place. You can see
these and other marks in
Figure 3-12.

Figure 3-12: Crop marks are handy to
print.

57
• Center Crop Marks: These crop marks show where the page will be
trimmed at the top, bottom, and each side.
• Description: To include a description on a printout, choose File➪File
Info and enter the text you want to appear. Then check the Descrip-
tion box in this dialog box.
• Labels: Selecting this check box prints the document name and
channel name on the image.
11. Set the options that apply when you’re printing to film for color sepa-
rations, if that’s the case.
Be sure to talk to your service bureau or offset printer representative
for their recommendations. (For more tips on prepress and printing, see
Book IX, Chapter 1.)
Here are your choices:
• Emulsion Down: The side of a film or photographic print paper that is
light-sensitive is called the emulsion side. You must specify whether
you want the emulsion side up or side down for film output. Emulsion
Down is the most common film output choice, although some publica-
tions may request Emulsion Up. The default is Emulsion Up (the check
box is not selected). This option is not available with all printers.
• Negative: When you print an image on paper, you usually want a
positive image, in which case you should not select the Negative
check box. If you’re printing the image on film (as is the case if
you’re printing color separations), your printer will probably
request a negative.
12. Click Print.

P
hotoshop offers a variety of ways to view your image doc-
uments as you work with them. You can pull back to
look at the big picture or zoom in to work on a tiny por-
tion of the image in minute detail. A useful Navigator
palette is also at hand to show you exactly where
you are in an image and help you move to a spe-
cific spot with a click of the mouse button. Should
you want to align objects precisely on the screen,
Photoshop offers grids and guides with some
“magnetic” properties. And, if you’re having trou-
ble finding the image you want, an uber-browser,
called Bridge, helps you search visually.
This chapter introduces you to all these viewing and
navigating aids, each designed to help you spend less
time cruising around the images and more time working
with them.
Looking at the Image Window
Each Photoshop image document resides in its own window. A great feature
of this window is that you can open multiple image windows for the same
image. This feature comes in handy because sometimes you want to look at

an image from two perspectives. For example, you may want to get up close
and personal with an image to edit pixels, but you still want to view the full
image in a fairly large size, as shown in Figure 4-1. In either case, all you
need to do is create a new image window for the same image. You can size
each window separately, and you can center the window on any portion of
the image you like.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 4-1: Creating a new image window enables you to view the overall image while
editing an area in close-up view.
Here’s a quick list of what you can do with multiple windows:
 Keep different parts of an image straight by creating multiple win-
dows. Select the document window you want and then choose
Window➪Arrange➪New Window for (filename) from the menu bar. You
can size and position the new window and zoom in or out without
affecting the view of the original window. 
 Keep windows organized by cascading them. If you find that you’ve 
created so many windows that you can’t view them all easily, Photoshop
can automatically arrange them for you in its working space. Choose
Window➪Arrange➪Cascade to create an overlapping stack of windows
arranged from the upper-left to the lower-right side of your display.

Looking at the Image Window
61
 Keep from losing important windows by tiling them. Choose Window➪
Arrange➪Tile Horizontally or Vertically to arrange the windows side by
side in a horizontal or vertical fashion without overlapping. Photoshop
changes the size of the document windows so they all fit on-screen, but
doesn’t change the zoom amount. The reduced-size windows have scroll
bars to let you view the hidden portion of the window.
 Tidy up by closing windows you don’t need anymore. To close a spe-
cific window, click its Close button in the upper-right corner of its title
bar in Windows (at the top left in the Mac OS).
 Close all windows in one fell swoop. To close all windows, choose
File➪Close All. You can also close all opened document windows by
pressing the Shift key and clicking any open document’s Close button.
On the Mac, do the same thing by pressing the Option key and clicking
the Close button.
 Minimize a document. In Windows, click the Minimize button (a square
with the horizontal line) to minimize a document window. Click the
Maximize button (a square with a square) to enlarge the image. On the
Mac, minimize an active document and place the thumbnail in the Dock,
by choosing Window➪Arrange➪Minimize or clicking the Minimize
button (circle with the horizontal line). To maximize the image, simply
click the image thumbnail in the Dock.
 Bring all Photoshop documents to the front (in Mac OS). The Mac OS
allows you to work in multiple applications and multiple files simultane-
ously. Sometimes when you switch back into working in Photoshop, your
documents may be buried behind non-Photoshop files that are open

One image, two monitors
For many image-editing enthusiasts and pro-
fessionals, one monitor simply isn’t enough. If
you have a recent version of Windows, such as
XP or Vista, installed or any recent Mac OS, you
can set up your computer so that you can use
two monitors to edit an image. The extra space
offers advantages for viewing and navigating
your images:
In Windows, you can drag the image window
anywhere in the Photoshop working space. If
you want to drag it to a second display screen
(and your video card supports spanning two
displays) you have to stretch the Photoshop
working space (or application window) across
both displays. This works great if both monitors
are the same size. But if the monitors are sig-
nificantly different sizes, it doesn’t work so well.
Either way, make sure your monitors are set to
the same resolution. Remember that you can,
however, move palettes and dialog boxes onto
a second monitor. 
Although explaining how to set up multiple mon-
itors on various operating systems is beyond the
scope of this book, you can likely find details on
how to set up an additional monitor in your
operating system’s Help feature.

 Get your images in a row (in Windows). Align minimized image windows
along the bottom of the screen by choosing Window➪Arrange➪Arrange
Icons. 
Zooming In and Out of Image Windows
Photoshop offers several ways to zoom in or out of an image, but you’ll
probably find yourself using one method, such as the keyboard shortcuts,
almost instinctively. Each method has advantages of its own. The following
sections offer a quick discussion of the main zoom features as well as some
of the lesser-known zooming tricks.
Zooming with keyboard shortcuts
The keyboard shortcuts are the quickest and easiest way to zoom, after you
use them enough to remember what they are. Table 4-1 offers a rundown of
the handiest keyboard shortcuts, which work no matter what tool you’re
using. When you press a keyboard shortcut, Photoshop zooms in or out by
one of its preset increments (such as 100 percent, 200 percent, 50 percent, 33
percent, 25 percent, and so forth). The maximum magnification Photoshop
now allows is 3,200 percent (up from a previous of 1,600%); the minimum
magnification is less than one percent, way more than you would ever need.

Click the Zoom tool in the Tools palette or press Z to activate it. Click any-

tioned in the preceding section. Press the Alt key (or the Option key on the
Mac) and click with the Zoom tool to zoom out. In either case, the zoom
centers on the point you click. 

Zooming In and Out of Image Windows

The Zoom tool’s big advantage is its zoom selection facility. With the Zoom
tool, drag in your image to create a temporary selection. When you release
the button, Photoshop zooms in to fill the image window at the highest mag-
nification that includes the selected area.
When the Zoom tool is active, you also have additional zoom tools on the
Options bar, as shown in Figure 4-2. Choosing a plus (+) or minus (-) sets the
default magnification of the Zoom tool to either enlarge or reduce the image.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 4-2: Zoom options include handy buttons for fitting your image on-screen and 
displaying the image’s print size.
As you zoom in and out, Photoshop does not alter the size of the document
window, so your image may become too large for its window (in which case
scroll bars appear so you can view the rest of the image) or too small (in
which case a gray border appears around the image). 
Select the Resize Windows to Fit option on the Options bar, and Photoshop
automatically changes the size of the document window to show the full
document in view, up to the size of the Photoshop working area.

Choose the Zoom All Windows option to have Photoshop size all open doc-
uments simultaneously. For the other options on the Options bar, see the
next section, “Other ways to zoom.”
Other ways to zoom
Although you’ll likely use the zoom methods mentioned in the preceding
section most often, Photoshop offers some other ways to zoom that come
in handy from time to time as well:
 Zooming from the View menu: Choose View➪Zoom In or View➪Zoom
Out to enlarge or reduce the image from the menu bar. You can also
choose from these options on the View menu:
• Actual Pixels (which shows your image on-screen at a 1:1 pixel ratio)
• Fit on Screen (which enlarges the image to the maximum size that
fits on-screen)
• Print Size (which shows the image at the size it will print)
To resize windows to fit on-screen when you’re not using the Zoom 
tool, choose Edit➪Preferences➪General (or Photoshop➪Preferences➪
General in Mac OS X) and select the Zoom Resizes Windows option.
 Typing ratios in the Magnification box: The Magnification box in the
status bar at the bottom of the Photoshop working area (in Windows)
or the bottom of each document (in Mac OS) shows the current magnifi-
cation ratio. Type an exact magnification ratio in this box to produce a
custom zoom level. This box is handy if you need a specific amount of
enlargement or reduction.
Another Magnification box appears in the Navigator palette, along with
some other options for zooming. I describe them later in this chapter.
 The following commands live on the Window➪Arrange menu.
• Match Zoom: Choose Match Zoom to have all your open documents
match the magnification percentage of your active document. 
• Match Location: Choose this command to match the locations of all
your open documents with the location of your active document.
For example, if you are viewing the center portion of an image,
choosing this command then adjusts the views of all your open doc-
uments to the center as well.
• Match Zoom and Location: And finally, Match Zoom and Location
does both commands simultaneously.
 Magnifing by dragging: With the Zoom tool, drag over the portion of
the image you want to zoom into. A selection marquee appears, and
when you release the mouse button, that portion of the image fills your

65
document window. To freeze and then move the selection marquee
around the image, begin your drag and then press the spacebar while
dragging the marquee to a new location.
Handling the Hand tool
The Hand tool helps you to quickly move around in an image document and
works similarly to a scroll bar. 
The Hand tool is more of a function than an actual tool because you rarely
need to click the Hand tool to use it. Simply press the spacebar while using
any other tool (except the Type tool), and the cursor changes into the Hand
icon, enabling you to move the image around in its window by dragging.
Here are some tips for using this tool:
 Press H to activate the tool: To activate the Hand tool without clicking
its icon in the Tools palette, just press the H key.
 Use the Options bar to change the size of a window: When the Hand
tool is active, the Actual Pixels, Fit on Screen, and Print Size buttons
appear on the Options bar. Click these buttons to enlarge or reduce the
image window so the whole image fits in the window; make the docu-
ment as large as it can be in your working space; or make the document
appear in the size it will be when printed.
 Use the Hand tool while zooming: When the Hand tool is active, you can
press the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and click the image to zoom
out, or press the Ctrl key (Ô key on the Mac) and click to zoom in — 
without needing to press the spacebar as you would with the normal 
keyboard shortcut.
 Scroll All Windows: This option enables you to move around all open
documents simultaneously.
Double-clicking the Hand tool resizes the document image so its longest
dimension expands to fill the screen in that direction. A tall, portrait-ori-
ented image balloons up until the document is as tall as possible in the
Photoshop working area. A wide, landscape-oriented image expands its
width to fit within the left and right borders of the screen.
 Press the Page Up or Page Down buttons to change the view: These but-
tons move the view up or down by a window.
Now that you have become friendly with the Zoom and Hand tools, here is
one last tip. If you press the Shift key while scrolling with the Hand tool or
zooming with the Zoom tool, all open image windows scroll or zoom together.
This trick can come in especially handy, for example, when you create
another view of the same document (Window➪Arrange➪New Window).

Cruising with the Navigator Palette
66
Cruising with the Navigator Palette
Some Photoshop users don’t use the Navigator palette, which is a roadmap
to your image document, nearly as often as they could, and there’s a simple
reason for that: In its default size, the Navigator palette is just too darned
small to be of use. 
Most new Photoshop users see the tiny Navigator window and decide that
working with such a small thumbnail image isn’t worth the bother. There’s a
quick fix, and after you’ve seen exactly what the Navigator palette can do
for you, it may become one of your favorite tools.
Here are the keys to using the Navigator palette:
 Resize the Navigator palette: Before you begin working with the Naviga-
tor palette, grab the size box at the lower-right corner of the Navigator
palette and drag it down and to the right to create a jumbo version with 
a much larger, more viewable thumbnail, as shown in Figure 4-3.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 4-3: The Navigator palette is more productive and user-friendly when enlarged.

Choosing a Screen Mode
67
Resizing works really well if you are using a second monitor. Placing the
jumbo-sized Navigator palette on the second monitor works great. For
more on working with two monitors, see the related sidebar elsewhere
in this chapter.
The Navigator palette is one palette that you probably don’t want to rel-
egate to the Palette Well. It’s most useful when it is visible at all times.
Position the Navigator palette to one side of your image so it’s ready for
instant use.
 View the thumbnail: The entire Navigator window shows the full docu-
ment image, with an outline called a View box showing the amount of
image visible in the document window at the current zoom level.
 Change the view: Click anywhere in the thumbnail outside the View box
to center the box at that position. The comparable view in your main
document window changes to match.
 Move the view: Click anywhere in the thumbnail inside the View box
and then drag to move the box to a new position. The main document
window changes to match the new view.
 Zoom in or out: Click the Zoom In button (which has an icon of two
large pyramids) or Zoom Out button (which has an icon of two smaller
pyramids) to zoom in or out. Or drag the Zoom slider that resides
between the two icons. The View box changes sizes as you zoom in or
out, and Photoshop magnifies or reduces the view in the original docu-
ment window to match, as well.
 Specify an exact magnification: The lower-left corner of the Navigator
palette has a Magnification box just like the one in the status bar. It
shows the current magnification, and you can type a new value to zoom
to the exact magnification level you need.
If the View box color is too similar to a dominant color in your image, you
can choose a new color for its outline by selecting Palette Options from the
Navigator palette pop-up menu.
Choosing a Screen Mode
Photoshop’s working area can become horribly cluttered. And here’s a
secret: The more adept you become, the more cluttered the desktop
becomes. Just when you begin to appreciate a neatly docked Options bar
and the convenience of displaying palettes, you realize that you’ve gobbled
up all your free working space.

Choosing a Screen Mode
68
Photoshop now has four different screen modes (or maybe six, depending
on what you consider to be a screen mode). Each mode shows or hides
some of the elements on the screen at the press of a key or click of the
mouse button. Four screen modes are at the bottom of the Tools palette
(press the screen icon and select the mode from the submenu); two more
are hidden but easily accessible. Table 4-2 shows you how to unclutter your
screen quickly.

Getting Precise Layout Results
Photoshop includes numerous useful features that help you lay out your
images precisely. There are dozens of reasons to make a selection in a par-
ticular place, position an object at an exact location, or align several objects
along the same imaginary line. Here are a few examples:
 You want to draw parallel lines exactly 50 pixels apart to create a
“window blind” effect.
 You’re creating a set of thumbnails that need to be aligned in neat rows
and columns.
 You want to create an object that is the exact same size (in one or more
dimensions) as another object already in your image.
You have several tools to help you do this, and more.
Creating guides
Guides are nonprintable horizontal and vertical lines that you can position
anywhere you like within a document window. Normally, they are displayed
as solid blue lines, but you can change guides to another color and/or to a
dashed line. 
Book I

Getting Precise Layout Results
70
To use guides, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Guides, Grid, Slices & Count (or
Photoshop➪Preferences➪Guides, Grid, Slices & Count in Mac OS X), as I
discuss in Book I, Chapter 5. Guides would be useful even if they were only,
well, guides. However, they have another cool feature: Objects and tools
dragged to within 8 screen pixels of a guide are magnetically attracted to
the guide and snap to it. That makes it ridiculously easy to align objects 
precisely. Because the objects snap to the guides, you can be confident that
you have placed the objects exactly on the guide and not just near it. You
can turn off the Snap to Guides feature if you want a little more control in
your arrangements. 
To place guides, follow these steps:
1. Make sure that rulers are visible in your image. Choose View➪Rulers
to display them, if necessary.
Anytime you create a guide by dragging from the ruler, the Show Guides
option automatically switches on. At other times, you can show or hide
guides by choosing View➪Show➪Guides, or by pressing Ctrl+semicolon
(Ô+semicolon on the Mac).
2. Click in the horizontal ruler and drag down to create a new horizon-
tal guide. Release the mouse button when the guide is in the location
you want.
3. Click in the vertical ruler and drag to the right to create a new verti-
cal guide. 
When you release the mouse button, your new guide stops.
You can also create a horizontal guide by Alt+clicking in the vertical
ruler (Option+clicking on the Mac), or a vertical guide by Alt+clicking in
the horizontal ruler (Option+clicking on the Mac). Use whichever
method is faster for you.
4. Use the Move tool (press V to activate it) to reposition your guides.
Look for the guides in Figure 4-5.
Using guides
After the guides are in place, here are a few of the things you can do with
them:
 Turn the Snap to Guides feature on or off: Choose View➪Snap To➪
Guides.
 Lock all guides so you don’t accidentally move them: Choose View➪
Lock Guides. You can also select Alt+Ctrl+semicolon (Option+Ô+
semicolon on the Mac).

any application where you want to align objects in a pleasing, geometrically
precise arrangement.
Grids share some features in common with guides but boast a few differ-
ences, too:
 Like guides, grids don’t print with your image. They are transparent arti-
facts used only as reference lines in your image, as shown in Figure 4-6.
 Objects and tools can optionally snap to the lines on a grid, depending
on whether you have View➪Snap To➪Grid turned on or off.
 You can show or hide grids by choosing View➪Show (Hide) ➪Grid.
 You can change the color of the grid and choose solid lines, dashed
lines, or dots for the grid by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Guides, Grid,
Slices & Count (Photoshop➪Preferences in Mac OS).
 You can specify the distance between grid lines and the number of subdi-
visions between grid lines in the Preferences dialog box. For more infor-
mation on setting grid and guide preferences, see Book I, Chapter 5.

Figure 4-6: Grids enable you to arrange elements in geometric order.
Measuring On-Screen
You can measure distances and objects within Photoshop many different
ways. The rulers, used in combination with guides, are a good way to mark
distances precisely so that you can create objects of a particular size. You

Measuring On-Screen
73
can change the increments used for these measurements in Photoshop’s
Preferences, as I detail in Book I, Chapter 5.
However, Photoshop also has a handy Ruler tool (formerly called the Measure
tool) you can use to lay measurement outlines in any direction. These lines
tell you a great deal more than just the size of the object you’re measuring.
You can also measure angles and determine the exact coordinates of an
object.
When you use the Ruler tool, the Options bar offers a read-out of informa-
tion that includes the following values:
 X, Y — the X and Y coordinates of the start of the line: For example, if
you start at the 1-inch position on the horizontal ruler and the 3-inch
position on the vertical ruler, the X and Y values on the Options bar are
1.0 and 3.0, respectively. (You select the increments for the X and Y
values on the ruler in Photoshop’s Preferences.)
 W, H — the horizontal (W) and vertical (H) distances traveled from
the X and Y points: A 1-inch long, perfectly horizontal line drawn from
the X,1 and Y,3 position shows a W value of 1.0 and an H value of 0.0.
 A: The angle of the first line.
 L1: The total length of the line.
 L2: The total length of the second line.
 Clear: Press the Clear button to delete your current measurement.
Measuring an object
To measure an object, follow these steps:
1. Select the Ruler tool.
It’s tucked away in the Tools palette with the
Eyedropper. Press I to cycle among the Eye-
dropper, Color Eyedropper, and Ruler tool
until it appears.
2. Click at a starting location for the measur-
ing line and then drag to the end location.
Press the Shift key to constrain the line to
multiples of 45 degrees.
3. Release the mouse button to create 
the measurement line, as shown in 
Figure 4-7.

Measuring an angle
You can measure an angle by drawing two lines and reading the angle
between them from the Options bar. Just follow these steps:
1. Select the Ruler tool.
2. Click at a starting location for the first line and drag to the end 
location.
You can press the Shift key to constrain the line to multiples of 45
degrees.
3. Release the mouse button to create the first line.
4. Press the Alt key (or the Option key on the Mac) and click the end-
point of the first line where you want to measure the angle.
5. Drag the second line and release the mouse button when it is finished.
6. On the Options bar, read the angle between the two lines (A).
You can also see the length of each line as L1 and L2, as shown in 
Figure 4-8.

Using the Info Palette
75
Using the Info Palette
The Info palette, shown in Figure 4-9,
displays a variety of information,
depending on what tool you’re using.
To specify which status info options
you want displayed, or whether you
want Tool Hints shown, choose Palette
Options from the Info palette pop-up
menu. For example, if you’re using the
Ruler tool, the information in the Info
palette duplicates the measurements
shown on the Options bar. Choosing
other tools modifies the Info palette’s
display to reflect the functions of that
tool. Here is some of the information
you can find out by keeping the Info
palette visible on your desktop:
 When using most tools, the Info
palette displays the X and Y coordinates of the cursor, as well as the
color values of the pixel directly beneath the cursor.
 When making a selection with the marquee tools, the Info palette shows
both the X and Y coordinates of the cursor, as well as the width and
height of the selection.
 When dragging with the Crop or Zoom tools, the Info palette shows the
width and height of the marquee used to define the cropping or zoom
borders. The Crop tool’s current angle of rotation is also displayed.
 With the Line, Pen, and Gradient tools, the Info palette shows the X and
Y coordinates of the starting position for the line, path, or gradient you
are defining, as well as the distance (L) of the line you’ve dragged, the
change in X and Y directions (Delta X and Delta Y), and the angle (A).
 When you use a transformation command, the Info palette displays the
percentage change in the Width, Height, and Angle, Angle of Horizontal
Skew (H), and Angle of Vertical Skew (V). For more on transformations,
see Book III, Chapter 3.
 When you use a color adjustment, such as Levels, the Info palette dis-
plays before and after color values beneath the mouse cursor. See Book
VIII, Chapter 1 for more on color adjustments.
 After you’ve made a selection with the Lasso or Magic Wand tools, the
Info palette also shows the Width and Height of the selection. Choose
Palette Options from the Info palette’s pop-up menu (click the triangle in
the upper right to open the pop-up menu). Here you can define a second
color readout in addition to the default readout, using a different color

model if you want, as shown in
Figure 4-10. In addition to the regu-
lar color modes, the default Actual
Color option displays values in the
current mode of the document.
Proof Color displays values based
on the setting chosen in
View➪Proof Setup. The Total Ink
option displays the percentage
CMYK ink under the cursor based
on the settings in the CMYK Setup
dialog box in the Color Settings
(Advanced). You can also define a
measurement increment for the
mouse cursor (in inches, pixels,
millimeters, and so forth) inde-
pendently of the increment you’ve
selected in Preferences. 
Working with Extras
Extras are the optional items displayed on your screen, such as grids,
guides and smart guides, selection and layer edges, annotations, slices, and
the target path (a line drawn with the Pen tool). Although you can turn on
and off the display of each of these options independently, the Extras func-
tion helps you to create a set of extras that you want to see or hide. You can
then turn them all on or off at once.
The following list explains how to show or hide these extras:
 To turn one extra on or off, choose
View➪Show and then choose the
extra you want to show.
 To show or hide extras in a group,
choose View➪Show➪Show Extras
Options. Select each extra that 
you want to show in the dialog 
box that appears, as shown in
Figure 4-11.
 To show or hide all the extras you’ve selected in Extras Options, choose
View➪Extras or press Ctrl+H (Ô+H on the Mac).

Managing Images with Adobe Bridge
Adobe Bridge, shown in Figure 4-12, is command and control central for, 
not just Photoshop, but the entire Adobe Creative Suite. Version CS3
enhances Bridge even more. So if you haven’t embraced Bridge yet, it won’t
be long before you appreciate the omnipresent power of this application.
Adobe Bridge enables you to visually browse your network, hard drives, 
and external media to find the exact image you need and has a multitude of
viewing, sorting, cataloging, and organizing features to manage all of your
assets — photographic, illustrative, video, written, and so on. The Bridge is
so multifaceted, that although you can access it from any Adobe application,
it is also a stand-alone program.
Here’s a brief description of what the Bridge offers:
 File Browsing: View, search, organize and process your files. You can
open, move, delete, rotate, and even perform automated tasks such as
Contact Sheet and PDF Presentation.
 Version Cue: If you have the Creative Suite installed, you can use the
Bridge to organize and manage your Version Cue projects.
 Bridge Home: Again, if you have the Creative Suite, you have access to
the Bridge Home, where you can get up to date information, such as
tips, tricks and news, on your Creative Suite applications. Click the
house icon at the top of the Favorites panel to get the Bridge Home.
 Camera Raw: You can now open and actually edit Camera Raw files
directly from the Bridge and save them in a format that is compatible
with Photoshop. 
 Stock Photos: This service from Adobe enables you to search and 
purchase royalty-free stock photography at reasonable prices. Low-
resolution images may be tried out for free prior to purchase.
 Color Management: Finally, you can use the Bridge to synchronize the
color settings across all your Creative Suite applications to ensure color
accuracy and consistency.
You can access the Bridge in several ways:
 Choose File➪Browse from Photoshop.
 Click the Bridge icon at the far left of the Options bar,
 To launch Bridge directly, choose Start➪Adobe Bridge in Windows
(double click the Bridge icon in the Dock or in the Applications/Adobe/
Bridge folder on the Mac).

 Menu bar: Commands found on the menu bar allow you to open or
delete images, get photos from your camera, create stacks, add file info,
and search for images. You can also label files and append their meta-
data (information about your file). The menu bar also offers options for
sorting and viewing files. Finally, on the Tools➪Photoshop menu you
have access to basically the same Automate menu that you find in
Photoshop itself.
 Look In menu: Across the top left edge of the Bridge is a bar that lists
the current location (such as a folder on your hard drive) on display.
Click the down pointing arrow to view the particular folder’s hierarchy
as well as Favorites and Recent Folders.
 Shortcut buttons: Create a new folder and rotate or delete files with a
click of the button. You can also switch to Compact mode (which I
explain how to do in the upcoming section “Configuring the Bridge
window”).
 Favorites panel: Located in the upper left, this panel provides easy
access to folders as well as Version Cue, Adobe Stock Photos and, if
you’re a Creative Suite user, the Bridge Center. Drag whatever hard
drives or folders you want to include in your Favorites panel.
 Folders panel: Also located in the upper left is a panel showing the
folder hierarchy on your computer. If an image file is available to your
computer, the File Bridge lets you use this palette to find it.
 Filter panel: Enables you to see your assets sorted by various criteria.
For example, you can view your images by date created, keywords, file
type, and even the ISO setting of your camera. Select your criteria in 
the filter panel and view the results in the Content window, as shown in
Figure 4-13. Click the icon of the folder with the “No” symbol at the top
of the Filter panel to get what Adobe refers to as the flattened view.
Basically you will be able to view all content in all subfolders, regardless
of file hierarchy.
 Preview panel: Beneath the Folder and Favorites panels is a preview of
the currently selected file. You can reduce or enlarge the preview.
 Content window: The largest area is reserved for displaying the con-
tent. This window shows thumbnail images of all the files, along with
information, in the currently selected folder. In addition, any subfolders
are shown with a folder icon.
 Keywords panel: This feature lets you tag your images with keywords,
such as the names of people or places, to enable easier locating and
sorting of images.

Figure 4-13: The new filter panel sorts and displays your assets.
 Metadata panel: The Metadata panel shows information about your
images. The File Properties section shows items such as filename, date
of creation, date last modified, image format, size, and so on. Any file
information for images added via File➪File Info displays in the IPTC 
section of the Metadata palette. Likewise, you can also enter or edit 
file information directly in the IPTC section in the Bridge. Finally, the
Camera Data section displays information associated with your digital
photos, such as the make and model of your camera, exposure, and ISO
speed. You can also display other types of metadata, such as Camera
Raw information, by choosing them in the Preferences dialog box
accessed via the Metadata palette pop-up menu. 
In Bonus Chapter 3 on this book’s companion Web site, you can find out
about the Notes and Annotations feature (an alternative to keywords)
and advanced features of the Metadata panel. See the Introduction for
details about this book’s Web site.
 Viewing and Workspace controls: At the bottom of the Bridge window
is a slider that reduces or enlarges the content thumbnails. Note that
you can now enlarge thumbnails up to 640 pixels. The remaining three
buttons enable you to change your workspace (see details in the next
section).

Configuring the Bridge window
The Bridge, being as enormous and full-featured as it is, is surprisingly flexi-
ble when it comes to how you configure its various panels. Here’s a run-
down of how to customize your Bridge window:
 To size the entire Bridge window, diagonally drag any corner or edge of
the window. On the Mac, drag the lower-right corner.
 To resize panes, drag the bar that divides them. Position your cursor
over the bar (it changes to a double-headed arrow) and click and drag
the bar to size the pane.
 To view just the Content window containing the thumbnails, click the
Show/Hide Panels button (double-headed arrow) located in the bottom-
left corner of the Bridge window.
 You can drag and regroup the tabbed panels in the Bridge just as you
can with Photoshop palettes. To collapse a panel, double-click its tab.
 After you configure your Bridge, you can save it as a workspace preset
that you can then call up at anytime. For example, you may want one
workspace for working with photos and yet another when working with
layout or word processing files. Simply choose Window➪Workspace➪
Save Workspace. Provide a name, a keyboard shortcut, and click Save.
To access the workspace, choose Workspace and then select the name
of your saved preset. You may also choose from a few preset work-
spaces designed for specific tasks. For example, if viewing files is your
most important task, then choose the Light Table preset, shown in
Figure 4-14. Not happy with a workspace? Choose delete or simply reset
your Workspace back to the default.
Note that you can also choose workspaces by clicking on the three buttons,
numbered one to three, at the bottom of the Bridge window. Change the
workspace from the Default (1) to Horizontal Filmstrip (2) to Metadata
Focus (3). Note that you can assign any of the presets, or custom, work-
spaces to the numbered workspace buttons by pressing the button and
choosing your desired workspace from the submenu.
You can also go the conventional route and choose the panel you want to
show or hide on the View menu.
Using the menu bar and buttons
The menu bar is a visual testimony to the numerous capabilities of the
Bridge. The next several sections provide a rundown of what you find on
each menu.

 Test in Device Central: Select a file and then this command where you
will launch the new Adobe Device Central mini-application. Here, you
can see how your image will look for a variety of mobile devices. See
Book I Chapter 3 for details on Device Central.
 Close Window: When you have enough of the Bridge, choose this 
command.
 Move to Trash: If you want to eliminate a file, select it and choose this
command. Kiss it goodbye by emptying the trash. You can also click the
trash icon in the top right of the Bridge window. Remember that when
trashing things via the Bridge, you are actually deleting them from the
desktop as well. 
 Eject: Select your media and then this command to eject it from your
computer.
 Return to (program): Choose this command to leave the Bridge and
return to your program of choice.
 Reveal in Explorer (Finder on the Mac): This command brings up your
operating system’s window and reveals the location of the selected file.
 Reveal in Bridge: This command visually escorts you to where your
selected file resides.
 Get Photos from Camera: Select your desired device and import your
images into your chosen folder and subfolder. Click Get Photos to start
the download. Click Advanced Dialog if you would like to apply meta-
data to the imported images.
 Move to: Select a file and move it to another location on your computer
or network.
 Copy to: Select a file and copy it to another location on your computer
or network.
 Place: Select a file, choose Place and then choose one of the CS3 appli-
cations, such as InDesign. That program then imports your selected file.
 Add to Favorites: You can choose to add or remove a folder from your
Favorites. If you’re not familiar with Favorites, it is a special folder that
lists your favorite files, folders, programs, and drives for quick and
handy access. You can easily find the Favorites panel in the Folders
panel and the Look In menu. And depending on your operating system,
you’ll come across numerous ways to access your Favorites.
 File Info: This feature lets you add some of your own metadata, such 
as title, author, copyrights, dates, credits, and so on. This information
can come in handy for photographers and reporters. You can also 
edit (replace, append, save, and delete) advanced data such as EXIF
(Extended File Information) properties and TIFF properties. But feel free
to leave this data as it is.

Many commands, such as Open, Copy, Delete, and Label are available via a
context menu. Simply select an image or folder and right-click
(Control+click on the Mac) to access the menu.
Edit menu
On the Bridge’s Edit menu, here are your options:
 Preferences: Mac users can find the Preferences window on the Bridge
menu, rather than Edit. Briefly, General preferences control the way the
Bridge looks and feels. For example, you can control how light or dark
to make the Content window for your files. Metadata preferences con-
trol which type of data is displayed in the Metadata panel. Read on to
find out more on metadata. You can assign names and keyboard short-
cuts to your colored Labels. Specify which application to use to open
files of certain types. The File Type Associations is specific to the
Bridge only. Advanced settings have to do with miscellaneous items,
such as the number of recently visited folders to display and more
advanced options such cache settings. I suggest leaving those settings
at their default unless you are certain you want to change them. 
 Undo/Cut/Copy/Paste/Duplicate: I lumped these commands together
because they are all self-explanatory. Undo undoes your last executed
command. Select a file and cut, copy, duplicate, or paste it from or into
your folder. 
 Select All/Deselect All: These two commands quickly select or deselect
all the files in your selected folder.
 Invert Selection: Selects everything that is currently not selected.
 Find: This command enables you to find files in selected folders for a
subfolder, based on a variety of criteria such as filename, dates, labels,
or keywords. Click Find and the files matching your criteria appear in
the Bridge Content window.
 Search Adobe Stock Photos: This command transports you (provided
you have an Internet connection up and running) to Adobe’s Stock
Photo portion of the Bridge where you can search for and purchase roy-
alty-free stock photos.
 Develop Settings: If you have Camera Raw images, you can open them
directly in the Bridge and apply the default Camera Raw settings or set-
tings from a previous conversion. You can also copy, paste and clear
settings via this submenu.
 Rotate: The rotate commands rotate your images in varying degrees
and direction. Note that when you rotate your images, the rotation is
shown in the Bridge only when you open the image. When you open the
image, Photoshop then applies the rotation. You can also click the
rotate buttons.

Managing Images with Adobe Bridge
85
 Generate High Quality Thumbnail or Generate Quick Thumbnail:
Choose whether to have Photoshop render a high quality or quick thumb-
nail. Note that your preview display is the same with either setting.
 Creative Suite Color Settings: See if the color settings of all of your
Creative Suite application are synchronized. If they aren’t, and you want
them to be, choose your desired setting from the list and click Apply.
 Camera Raw Preferences: Choose this command to establish your
Camera Raw image, cache and DNG File Handling settings. Mac users
can find the Camera Raw Preferences window on the Bridge menu,
rather than Edit. For more on Camera Raw see Book II Chapter 2. 
Stacks menu
You can now select a group of images and create a stack. This makes them
easier to manage and cuts down on clutter in your Content window. The 
top image thumbnail in the stack is visible in the Content window and the
number of the image in the stack is visible on the top-left corner of that
thumbnail, as shown in Figure 4-15. Normally (but not mandatory), you
would want to create stacks from similar images such as multiple exposures
of the same subject, multiple poses of a portrait, and so on. Here are the
options found under the Stack menu:
 Group as Stack: Select your desired photos and choose this command
to create a stack.
 Ungroup from Stack: Select a photo and choose this command to
remove it from the stack.
 Open/Close Stack: Select Open to display each image in the stack (sur-
rounded by an outline). Choose Close to collapse the stack back to a
single thumbnail representation.
 Promote to Top of Stack: First, open the stack and choose your desired
image. Apply this command to have that image appear on top of the
stack. 
 Expand/Collapse All Stacks: Opens and displays, or closes, all images
in all stacks.
View Menu
Here’s what the View menu has to offer:
 Compact Mode: Select this option to get a pared-down Bridge with just
a Content window — no panels.
 Slideshow: This neat option leaves the Bridge interface and displays
just the images, full screen, from your selected folder.

 Slideshow Options: Choose settings for your slideshow, including the
duration of your slide display, type and duration of your transitions and
whether or not to display a caption among others. 
 As Thumbnails/Details: Display your content in the default view of
thumbnails. Or view it with Details, where you get a large thumbnail
along with metadata, ratings and labels, as shown in Figure 4-16.
 Show Thumbnail Only: This option shows just the thumbnail of the
image without the accompanying data such as filename, date, and so on.
 Show Reject Files: Display files that you have labeled with the new
harsh moniker of Reject.
 Show Hidden Files: Select this option to see files that Photoshop doesn’t
recognize.

 Sort: From this menu, select the criteria by which you want to sort your
files. The default is by the name of your file, but a ton of other options,
such as label, rating, or date are up for grabs. After you select the crite-
ria, the Bridge displays your files accordingly.
 Refresh: If you’ve renamed a file, the order of your files isn’t updated in
the Bridge’s window. Choose Refresh or press F5, to get your files in
order. Note that you can also choose Refresh from the Folders panel
pop-up menu.
Tools menu
Here are the offerings on the Tools menu:
 Batch Rename: Choose this command to rename multiple image files
within a folder in one execution. You can choose to rename the files and
keep them in the same folder or move them to a new folder. Click the
Choose button to select that folder. Next, designate how your files are
named. Choose an option from the pop-up menu or type your own.
Next, choose the starting number for renamed images and check
whether you want to enable the naming convention to be compatible
with another platform.

 Device Central: This command will launch Adobe’s new Device Central,
a mini-application that lets you create graphics for mobile devices, such
as cell phones. See Book I Chapter 3 for more details.
 Version Cue: This menu command is for Creative Suite users working
with Version Cue, Adobe’s collaborative workflow feature. The menu
offers all the Version Cue commands, such as creating a new project or
marking that a file is in use and can be found on the submenu.
 Create Metadata Template and Edit Metadata Template: Choose which
metadata you want to include in the template. Name the template and
save it. Choose Edit Metadata Template if you need to later modify the
template.
 Append Metadata and Replace Metadata: Allow you to add or substi-
tute existing metadata based on a template. To create a template, choose
File➪File Info. In the File Info dialog box, enter all your desired data.
Then choose Save Metadata Template from the dialog box pop-up
menu. Name the template and click Save.
 Cache: Cache is memory that stores frequently used data, such as thumb-
nails and file info, to allow for quicker loading when you display a previ-
ously viewed image or folder. Building cache for a subfolder enables you
to store the information for a selected folder. If you purge the cache, you
delete ranking and thumbnail information, thereby creating more disk
space. Exporting cache lets you export to the folder selected in the Look
In bar. Cache allows you to burn a CD without generating thumbnails.
 Photoshop: All the features are the same as those on the Photoshop
File➪Automate menu. See Book IX, Chapter 2 for more on contact
sheets, picture packages, Photomerge, Merge to HDR, Batch Processor,
and PDF Presentation. For more on Web Photo Gallery, see Bonus
Chapter 2. For more info on batch processing, see Book II, Chapter 5.
 Photoshop Services: You can access Adobe’s partners and service
providers online to order products, such as prints and photo books.
Label menu
The Label menu offers commands for rating and labeling your files:
 Rating: Rank your files using the one to five star system. You can now
also apply a Reject rating, for those images that aren’t up to par. Use the
View➪Sort menu or the Filter panel to choose your desired ranking.
Those ranked files then display in the Content window.
 Labels: Label your files for quick identification and organization. Again,
use the View➪Sort menu or the Filter menu to choose and view the
labeled files.

89
Note that you can now assign labels and ratings to folders.
Window Menu
If you’ve configured the Bridge just to your liking and want to save it as a
workspace for future retrieval, choose Workspace➪Save Workspace. You
can also choose from preset workspaces that are configured for specific
tasks, such as optimum viewing of thumbnails or pinpointing metadata. 
You can also choose to display or hide your various panels under the
Window menu. Finally you can open a new Bridge window.
You should be aware that Photoshop has bestowed the Content window
with light table powers. You can drag images around to reorder, group, or
rank them. What the heck? You can just drag them around to give them a
little exercise if you want. Sitting in the Bridge window all day can make a
file a little stiff.
Using keywords
Keywords are descriptive labels that you attach to files. They help to catego-
rize your images, enabling you to more efficiently and quickly locate your
desired files. Here is the lowdown on creating and using keywords.
 To create a new keyword set (a categorical folder which contains key-
words), click the folder icon at the bottom of the Keywords panel or
choose New Keyword Set from the Keywords panel pop-up menu. Name
your set and press Enter (Return on the Mac).
 To create a new keyword, select your desired keyword set, click the 
dog-eared page icon at the bottom, or choose New Keyword from the
Keywords panel pop-up menu. Type the keyword you want to add, as
shown in Figure 4-17, and press Enter (Return on the Mac).
 To rename an existing keyword set or keyword, select it and choose
Rename from the Keywords panel pop-up menu. Provide a new name
and press Enter (Return on the Mac).
Note that renaming a keyword in the panel doesn’t also rename it if
you’ve applied it to a file.
 To delete a keyword set or keyword from the panel, select it and click
the trash can icon or choose Delete from the Keywords panel pop-up
menu. Again, deleting the keyword doesn’t delete it from any files that
you’ve previously applied it to.
 To apply a keyword, select the file or files and check the box to the left
of the keyword in the panel.

 To remove a keyword from a file, select the file(s) and deselect the key-
word in the panel.
 To apply all the keywords in a set, select the files and select the check
box to the left of the keyword set.
 To search for images labeled with certain keywords, choose Find from
the Keywords panel pop-up menu. Choose your desired folder or disk
from the Look In menu or click the Browse button to navigate to your
desired location. Select your criteria from the pop-up menu, choose
either Contains or Does Not Contain, and enter your text. To add addi-
tional criteria fields, click the plus sign. When finished, click the Search
button. All images containing your entered keyword appear in the
Content window of the Bridge. You can now click the Save As Collection
button to store and arrange your images in a digital photo album
referred to as a collection. 
Right-click (Control+click on the Mac) on a keyword in the panel and select

 Managing settings with the Preset Manager
N
ow, more than ever, Photoshop lets you have it your way without
having to make a trip down to the local burger shack. You can easily
customize the look of your workspace, specifying everything from the loca-
tion of palettes to the arrangement of dialog boxes when you begin a ses-
sion. You can even store these physical layouts and recall them
anytime you like. And now in addition to customizing your
keyboard shortcuts, you can also customize your menus
to highlight certain workflow commands.
Photoshop also makes it easy to choose how cer-
tain tools and features operate. You can choose
how the cursors for tools such as brushes look,
tell Photoshop your preferred way of storing files,
and specify just how much memory you’d like to
set aside for image editing. You can set all these
preferences once and then forget them, or you can
change them from time to time as your needs
change. This chapter shows you how to customize
your workspace and preferences so that Photoshop
works your way.
Creating Workspace Presets
Photoshop is a complicated program; the more you learn, the more compli-
cated (and routine) your activities become. For one project, you may find
yourself using the Styles palette repeatedly to add special effects to layers.

Creating Workspace Presets
92
For your next project, you may never use the Styles palette but require fre-
quent access to the Paths palette to create curves that you use to make
selections. And so it goes. 
Use custom workspaces to save time and effort, or to instantly clean up a
messy desktop.
Custom workspaces come in handy if you share a computer with students,
family members, or coworkers. Those who prepare images for both Web
and print have different needs that may call for special workspaces, too. 
You can start with one of the many preset workspaces. Photoshop CS3 offers
preset workspaces for various workflows, such as retouching, Web design,
working with type, and many others. These presets modify menu and/or 
keyboard shortcuts. Palettes, however, remain untouched. You can select a
preset, then establish your palette preferences, and then save the modified
workspace as your own custom workspace. Read on to find out how.
You can tailor your workspace in these ways:
 Combine palettes to group together the ones you use most often. Drag
a palette’s tab into another palette group to add it to that group. If the
Layers, Channels, and History palettes are the ones you use most often,
you might want to group them together. You can collapse palettes that
you rarely use down to space saving icons, minimize them to just their
title bars, or close them altogether.
Before saving your workspace preset, show or minimize, collapse, or
close the palettes as you prefer them and move them to the locations
you want on your screen.
 Position dialog boxes. Photoshop’s menu bar dialog boxes pop up in
the same location they appeared the last time you used them. You may
want to drag them to a specific place on your screen and store that
location when you save your workspace preset. When I’m working with
a large image, I sometimes position dialog boxes on the screen of my
second monitor to maximize the area for the image on my main display.
 Customize the Options bar. You can grab the gripper bar at the left
edge of the Options bar and drag it to another location. For example,
you can dock the bar at the lower edge of your screen or have it float in
a specific place on your Photoshop desktop. Photoshop stores these
settings with your workspace preset.
 Set Photoshop’s font size. You can now even change the size of the font
for text that is displayed on the Options bar, palettes, and tool tips.

Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts
93
Choose Edit➪Preferences➪General (Photoshop➪Preferences➪General
on the Mac). Choose Small, Medium, or Large from the UI Font Size pop-
up menu. The change takes place the next time you start Photoshop.
Saving and Deleting Workspace Presets
After you set up your custom workspace, you can save it by choosing
Window➪Workspace➪Save Workspace. In the Save Workspace dialog box
that appears, type a name for your saved workspace. 
You have the additional options of
selecting which components — palette
locations, keyboard shortcuts, and
menus — you want to capture in your
custom workspace, as shown in Figure
5-1. After you check your desired set-
tings, click the Save button.
Your saved workspace now appears as
a listing on the Workspace submenu.
Want to return to the way Adobe sees the world of Photoshop? Choose
Window➪Workspace➪Default Workspace. If you decide to revert any of your
workspace components to the default settings, choose Window➪Workspace➪
Reset Palette Locations or Reset Keyboard Shortcuts or Reset Menus. 
To delete a saved workspace, choose Window➪Workspace➪Delete
Workspace. In the Delete Workspace dialog box that appears, choose the
name of the workspace you want to remove from the drop-down list. Click
the Delete button, and your preset is gone, gone, gone.
You can now save a new workspace, as well as delete it or choose a preset,
by clicking the handy new Workspace button on the right side of the Options
bar. Simply click the down pointing arrow and make your selection from the
submenu.
Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts
For those of you who are like me — I avoid using a mouse and prefer the
ease and speed of keyboard shortcuts — Photoshop offers customizable
keyboard shortcuts. You can assign shortcuts to menu commands, palette
commands, and tools. You can edit, delete, or add to the Photoshop default

set or create your own custom set. Here are the steps to work with key-
board shortcuts:
1. Choose Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts. 
You can also choose Window➪Workspace➪Keyboard Shortcuts &
Menus. The Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box appears, shown in Figure 5-2.
Then click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab.
2. Choose between the Photoshop Defaults set or the Working with Type
or Video and Film set. You can also create a new set by clicking the
New Set button (the disk with a down arrow icon).
Clicking New Set makes a copy of the selected set for you to then edit
and customize. If you choose a new set, name the set (leaving it with a
.kys extension), and keep it stored in the Keyboard Shortcuts folder.
3. Choose Application Menus, Palette Menus, or Tools from the Short-
cuts For drop-down list. Click the triangle to expand the particular
menu headings.
Figure 5-2: Customize keyboard shortcuts for enhanced productivity.

Customizing Menus
95
4. Select your desired command from the list. Type the shortcut keys
you want to assign to that command in the shortcut field. If a shortcut
has already been assigned to that command, you can simply type
over it.
If the keyboard shortcut you type is already being used, Photoshop
warns you that if you accept the shortcut, it will be removed from the
original command.
5. Click Accept or the Add Shortcut button.
If you later change your mind and want to use the original keyboard
shortcut (if there was one), click Use Default. If you decide you don’t
want the shortcut at all, click Delete Shortcut. And if you make a mis-
take, just click Undo.
Application and Palette menu commands must include a Ctrl (Ô on the
Mac) and/or an F key in the keyboard shortcut.
6. When you finish, click the Save Set button (the disk icon). 
If you want to delete the set, click the Delete Set button (the trash icon).
7. Click the Summarize button to save the keyboard shortcut set as an
.htm file, which loads in your Internet browser. You can then print
the file and keep it as a handy reference of your shortcuts.
8. Click OK to exit the dialog box.
Customizing Menus
Adobe takes the customization club to yet another level by adding the abil-
ity to customize menus. You have the choice of colorizing chosen menu
items or hiding the menu items altogether, as shown in Figure 5-3. 
The following steps explain how to make the Photoshop menus your own:
1. Choose Edit➪Menus.
You can also choose Window➪Workspace➪Keyboard Shortcuts &
Menus. The Keyboard Shortcuts and Menus dialog box appears (refer to
Figure 5-3). Then click the Menus tab.
2. In the Set drop-down list at the top, choose the Photoshop Defaults set
or one of the many presets. Or to create a new menu, click the New
Set button (the disk with a down arrow icon).
Clicking New Set makes a copy of the selected set for you to then edit
and customize. If you choose a new set, name the set (leaving it with a
.mnu extension), and keep it stored in the Menu Customization folder.

lowing options.
• To hide or show a menu item, click the Visibility button. Be careful
not to hide the really critical commands, such as Open or Save and
especially not Edit➪Menus.
• To add color to a menu item, click the Color Swatch (or the word
None) and choose a color from the drop-down list.
5. When you finish making changes, click the Save Set button (the disk
icon). 
To delete a menu set, click the Delete Set button (trash icon).
Or to create a new set based on the current menu, click the Save Set As
button.

97
6. In the Save dialog box, enter a name for the set and click Save.
7. Click OK to exit the dialog box.
If you’ve hidden some menu items and decide you want to temporarily show
them while working in Photoshop, choose Show All Menu Items from the
menu with the hidden items.
To turn menu colors off (they’re on by default) choose Edit➪Preferences➪
Interface(Photoshop➪Preferences➪Interface on the Mac) and deselect
Show Menu Colors.
Setting Your Preferences
Photoshop stores settings for many different options in various Preferences
files on your hard drive. The first time you run Photoshop after a new instal-
lation, you probably want to customize Preferences to suit your own needs.
You can access the Preferences dialog box by choosing Edit➪Preferences
(Photoshop➪Preferences on the Mac). The first category of settings that
appear in the submenu are the General Preferences (shown in Figure 5-4).
You can choose any of the other Preferences categories from the submenu.
Figure 5-4: The General Preferences dialog box specifies a lot of the “look and feel” of your
Photoshop interface.

Version CS3 revamped the Preferences dialog box by adding a list of all of
the Preferences categories on the left of the dialog box. In addition to the
new look of the dialog box, Photoshop added a couple new categories and
moved certain settings around.
Once you’re in any Preferences dialog box, you can also move between the
dialog boxes by clicking the Prev or Next buttons that appear in each of the
Preferences dialog boxes. If you like keyboard shortcuts, you can switch to
the other Preferences dialog boxes by pressing Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2 (Ô+1, Ô+2 on
the Mac), and so forth. The next several sections give you a rundown of
what you can do with the settings in the different Preferences dialog boxes.
Setting general preferences
The General Preferences dialog box is where you select some options that
are, well, general in nature. You can select some choices from drop-down
lists, and others are check boxes you can select or deselect to activate or
disable that option. Here’s a rundown of options in the upper part of the
dialog box:
 Color Picker: Choose the familiar Adobe Color Picker to select precise
colors or work with the Windows or Macintosh system color pickers, as
desired. You might want to use the Windows or Apple color picker, for
example, if you’ve previously defined some custom colors outside Photo-
shop and now want to make them available for a Photoshop project.
 Image Interpolation: When Photoshop resizes an image, it must either
create new pixels (when making the image larger) or combine existing
pixels (to make the image smaller). To do this, the program examines
neighboring pixels and uses the information to derive the new or
replacement pixels. You can select the type of mathematical algorithm
Photoshop uses to do this, though you likely want to stick with the
default option, Bicubic (best for smooth gradients). You can find out
more on interpolation and the other algorithms in Book II, Chapter 1.
 UI Font Size: Specify the size of the text displayed in dialog boxes,
palettes, and so on. Choose from Small, Medium, or Large.
In the Options section of the General Preferences dialog box, you find nearly
a dozen check boxes that you can select or deselect, as described in the fol-
lowing list:
 Automatically Launch Bridge: Check this option to have Adobe Bridge
(technically a stand-alone program) automatically launch when Photo-
shop is launched. See Book I, Chapter 4 for details about the Bridge.

Setting Your Preferences
99
 Auto-Update Open Documents: When you’re working on an image and
move to another application to work on the same image, you’ll probably
want the changes made in the other application to reflect in the docu-
ment still open in Photoshop. Select this check box so that Photoshop
monitors the document and updates its version whenever the document
is changed in the other application.
 Beep When Done: I remember the bad old days when computers were
slow and Photoshop would take a minute or two to apply the Gaussian
Blur filter or perform calculations when merging even moderate-sized
image layers. The Beep When Done signal was my cue to stop watching
television and resume working with Photoshop. Although most opera-
tions are a lot faster today, if you’re working with very large images or
simply like to be notified when a step is finished, the beep option can be
useful (or incredibly annoying to your coworkers).
 Dynamic Color Sliders: The sliders in the Color palette change colors
to match the settings you make. If your computer is on the slow side,
you can turn off this feature to improve performance.
 Export Clipboard: When this feature is active, Photoshop transfers its
private clipboard (used only within Photoshop) to the general Windows
or Macintosh Clipboard so that you can paste information into other
applications. If you activate this option, switching from Photoshop to
other applications takes a little longer, and Photoshop’s clipboard con-
tents replace whatever was in your system Clipboard when you switched.
The clipboard is generally a poor vehicle for moving image data between
applications because the transferred information may not be of the best
quality. Instead, save your file and open it in the other application. If you
do this, you can turn off the Export Clipboard option, saving you some
time when switching between applications.
 Use Shift Key for Tool Switch: When this feature is active, you can
change from one tool in the Tools palette to another in the same flyout
menu (say, to change from the Gradient tool to the Paint Bucket tool) by
pressing the Shift key and the keyboard shortcut for that tool.
 Resize Image During Paste/Place: By default, when you place or paste
files that are larger than the document they are being pasted or placed
into, the files are resized to fit. Uncheck this option to have the file
import with its exact dimensions, as shown in Figure 5-5.
 Zoom Resizes Windows: Select this check box if you want your docu-
ment windows to grow and shrink to fit your document as you zoom in
and out. Deselect this check box if you want the document’s window to
always remain the same size; you might want to deselect the check box
if you frequently work with several documents side by side and don’t
want them to change relative size as you zoom in and out.

 Zoom with Scroll Wheel: This handy option enables your mouse scroll
wheel to become a zooming tool, regardless of which tool you are using.
Figure 5-5: Check the Resize Image During Paste/Place to have your image 
automatically resized upon import.
In the History Log section, you can have Photoshop record all your editing
commands. The History Log feature is handy if you want to present a fin-
ished, fully edited image to a client or manager, but need to be able to show
the steps of how you got there. Or maybe you want a record of the steps, so
you can repeat them on other images and don’t want to rely on your memory. 
You have a few formats in which you can save your history log:
 Metadata: Saving the log to metadata (information embedded in your
image file) allows you to view the log in the Bridge window. For more on
the Bridge, see Book I, Chapter 4.
 Text File: You can save the log to a text file. Click the Choose button to
provide a name and location for the file.
Resized

Setting Your Preferences
101
 Both: This option saves the log as both metadata and a text file.
 Edit Log Items: You choose Sessions Only, Concise, or Detailed. The
Sessions Only option records your editing until you close the file or quit
Photoshop. The Concise option keeps a comprehensive log (multiple
sessions), but in short and sweet steps. The Detailed option provides a
comprehensive, detailed log. For example, a concise log entry may be
just Crop, whereas a detailed log entry may be Crop to rectangle
and then also provide the original and cropped dimensions, the angle
and the resolution values.
The last option in the General Preferences dialog box is the Reset All
Warning Dialogs button. If you’ve turned off the display of certain warnings
by selecting the Don’t Show Me This Dialog Box Again check box, you can
reactivate all the warnings by clicking this button.
Interface
Version CS3 moved a few items related to the “look” of Photoshop out of the
General and Display & Cursors categories into a new category called
Interface, shown in Figure 5-6. Makes sense to me. Here’s the scoop:
 Use Grayscale Toolbar icon: Check this setting to convert the Ps icon at
the tip of the toolbar to grayscale rather than color.
 Show Channels in Color: When selected, this option tells Photoshop to
show each of the color channels (for example, Red, Green, and Blue, or
Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) in their respective colors in the
Channels palette. In most cases, you won’t want to use this feature. You
need to be able to see the channels in their grayscale form to perform
image-editing tasks such as converting from color to grayscale, channel
masking, or for selective sharpening on certain channels. Book VI,
Chapter 1 introduces channels.
 Show Menu Colors: Check this option to have the ability to view cus-
tomized menus in color.
 Show Tool Tips: Photoshop can display little pop-up reminders about
tools and other objects on your screen. If you find these reminders dis-
tracting, deselect this check box to turn off tool tips.
 Auto-Collapse Icon Palettes: If checked, palettes will automatically col-
lapse down to just their icons when you click somewhere else within the
Photoshop application.
 Remember Palette Locations: Select this check box if you want Photo-
shop to restore your most recent palette locations the next time you
start up. Deselect this check box if you always want your palettes in the
same location each time you begin working.

Deciding how you want files handled
The options in the File Handling Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 5-7,
control how Photoshop handles files as they are opened and closed. Here’s
the lowdown on these options:
 Image Previews: Storing a preview thumbnail with an image can speed
up browsing for the image you want. You can tell Photoshop to save a
preview by default or to ask you first (in case you want to create images
that are a little smaller in size, especially for the Web). Or you can also
choose not to ever save a preview. Mac users need to select the kinds of
image previews they need. Select the Icon option to enable an image icon
to appear on the desktop. Select the Macintosh Thumbnail option to see
a preview in the Open dialog box. Select the Windows Thumbnail option
to see a preview in a Windows OS dialog box. Finally, select the Full Size
option to save a low-resolution version of the file to use in applications
that can open only low-resolution (72 ppi) Photoshop images.
 Append File Extension: You can select whether the file extensions
appended to filenames (such as .psd, .tif, and so forth) are consis-
tently uppercase or lowercase, as you prefer. On Macs, you can choose
whether to add extensions by selecting from the Always, Never, or Ask
When Saving options. If you want cross-platform compatibility with PCs
or prep Web graphics, select the Always option. Mac users, select the
Use Lower Case option to save extensions as lowercase characters.

Setting Your Preferences
103
Figure 5-7: The File Handling Preferences dialog box offers settings for opening and saving
files.
 Prefer Adobe Camera Raw for JPEG Files: Version CS3 now enables
you to open and edit JPEGs in Adobe Camera Raw (ACR). Select this
option to have ACR open JPEGs by default when choosing File Open 
or when double-clicking on a JPEG, as shown in Figure 5-8.
 Prefer Adobe Camera Raw for Supported Raw Files: Check this 
setting to have ACR open any and all raw file formats supported by
Photoshop.
 Ignore EXIF Profile Tag: When this option is selected, Photoshop
ignores the sRGB tag that many digital cameras add to their EXIF
(camera) data. The sRGB tag is widely used, but not well respected
among many high-end digital photography professionals.
 Ask Before Saving Layered TIFF Files: Photoshop can save an
advanced type of TIFF file that includes layers, exactly as with its own
native PSD files. However, many applications cannot read these files. If
you always open TIFF files in Photoshop, or you are using recent ver-
sions of other Creative Suite applications which can accept layered
TIFFs and don’t mind creating larger TIFF files in the process, you can
disable this option. Otherwise, Photoshop asks you for confirmation
each time you want to save a TIFF file that contains layers.

Setting Your Preferences
104
Figure 5-8: Direct Photoshop to open JPEGs in Adobe Camera Raw by default.
 Maximize PSD File and PSB File Compatibility: Photoshop lets you
choose an option for file compatibility. 
Not all applications can handle the more sophisticated features that
may be stored in a PSD file (such as fancy layer effects). If you fre-
quently open PSD files in applications other than later versions of
Photoshop, you may want to set this option to Always. Keep in mind
that you may lose some features when you choose this option. Choose
Ask to have Photoshop prompt you when you save a file as to whether
you want the option. Or select Never to ignore the option completely.
When you maximize compatibility, Photoshop saves a composite 
(flattened) version along with the layered file to ensure that older 
applications (such as Version 2) can read the files. However, this option
can make your file size balloon significantly. In addition, when you save
in this mode, you get an annoying warning that your file may not be
read by future versions of Photoshop. This silly warning appears every
time you save a layered PSD file.

Setting Your Preferences
105
The PSB (large file) format is like the PSD format in that it supports most
Photoshop features. Currently, only Photoshop CS, CS2 and CS3 can open
PSB files. Again, keeping this option checked ensures maximum compati-
bility with any future programs that may accept this format.
If you plan to use your PSD files in InDesign or Illustrator, you should
have the maximize compatibility feature selected because the perform-
ance of these programs is faster when a composite is along with the
layers, especially with large files with lots of layers.
 Enable Version Cue: Select this option if your computer is located on a
network and you need to share your files with others in your workgroup
by using a server. 
 Recent File List Contains: Type a value from 0 to 30 to specify the
number of recently used files you want displayed in the Recent File list
on the File menu.
Performance
Although the preference settings themselves aren’t new, the category is.
Everything you need to specify Photoshop’s performance can be found in
this new dialog box. Here are the options, as shown in Figure 5-9:
 Memory Usage: The perennial question: How much memory does Photo-
shop require? The perennial answer: As much as you can cram into your
computer! Memory is so inexpensive right now you have no excuse for
not having at least a gigabyte of RAM, and more is even better if you’re
using an operating system that can handle extra memory efficiently, such
as Windows XP or Vista and Mac OS X. Version CS3 runs at its best with
two gigabytes of RAM.
When you cram your RAM, you want to make sure Photoshop can use
as much as you can spare. You can use the Memory Usage slider, shown
in Figure 5-9, to allocate your memory. Use a value of 50 to 80 percent,
depending on how much memory you have to waste. Allocating more to
Photoshop reduces the RAM for other applications, so if you have other
programs that need lots of memory, choose a prudent value.
 History States: Photoshop remembers how your document looks at var-
ious stages of editing, storing all the image information on your hard
drive and listing the individual states in the History palette. (For more
information on using the History palette, see Book II, Chapter 4.)
Keeping track of every change you make requires lots of memory and
hard drive space, so you can specify how many resources to use by
typing a value into this box. The default is 20 (the max is 1000). If you
have resources to burn and frequently find yourself stepping way back
in time to modify or delete a step, you can type a larger number. If your
resources are skimpy and you don’t anticipate making many changes to
earlier steps (or are willing to take frequent snapshots or save interim
images), you can enter a smaller number.

Figure 5-9: Use the Memory Usage setting to allocate the maximum amount of RAM
Photoshop gobbles up.
 Cache levels: You can set aside the amount of memory for storing screen
images in the Cache levels setting, to speed up redraws of a reduced-view
image on your screen as you make changes. You can specify the number
of copies of your image stored in memory, from the default value of 6 up
to 8 levels.
 Scratch disks: Scratch disks are areas on your hard drive that
Photoshop uses to substitute for physical RAM when you don’t have
enough RAM to work with the images you have opened. Scratch disks
are no replacement for physical memory, but Photoshop will need
scratch disks many times, even if you have huge amounts of memory.
Photoshop uses your startup drive (the drive used to boot your operat-
ing system) as its first scratch disk by default. That may not be the 
best choice because your startup drive is usually pretty busy handling
requests of your operating system and, if you’re running Windows,
requests for Windows’s own virtual memory scheme (your so-called
swap file or paging file). Ideally, your scratch disk(s) should be a differ-
ent hard drive and, preferably, the fastest one you have available.
If you have more than one hard drive, choose one other than your
startup drive as your first scratch disk. Select your fastest drive; for
example, select a FireWire 800 or USB 2.0 drive over one using the 

Setting Your Preferences
107
original, slow, USB 1.1 connection. If you have an Ultra-DMA EIDE drive
or, better yet, a SCSI drive, use that. Although Ultra-DMA drives have
transfer rates that rival even the speediest SCSI models, SCSI can be
better because the SCSI bus is designed for multitasking. You often get
better performance than with an EIDE drive that shares one of the two
EIDE channels with other devices.
If you don’t have a second hard drive, you can improve scratch disk 
performance by creating a partition on an existing drive for use as a
scratch disk. Remember to keep the scratch disk defragmented (that is,
with the files all organized together on your hard drive) by using your
favorite defragmentation utility. 
 GPU Settings: Photoshop attempts to auto detects your video card and
lists the make and model. Check Enable 3D Acceleration to enhance the
performance of your graphics display and speed up your screen redraw.
If some of your tool cursors aren’t displaying while editing an image, try
unchecking this option to see if it fixes the problem.
Adjusting your cursors
The Cursors Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 5-10, enables you to set
several options that control how cursors display on-screen. The following
list describes these options:

 Painting and Other Cursors (shown in Figure 5-11):
Choose the Standard option to show a tool’s cursor
as an icon representing the tool itself (although I
don’t know why you’d want to do this). 
• Use Precise to switch to a cursor that has
crosshairs, which is useful for positioning the
center of a tool’s operational area in a particular
place. 
• The Normal Brush Tip displays a 50% point for
the brush tip, which means that the diameter of
the brush tip reflects feathering of 50% or more.
The wispier feathered areas of 50% or less are
outside the diameter area shown. 
• Full Size Brush Tip displays the full size of the
diameter of the brush tip. 
• Show Cross Hair in Brush Tip is a great hybrid. It
shows a cross hair in the center of either of the
brush tips — great for precision retouching. 
Most users prefer to set the painting cursors to
Brush Size and the other cursors to Precise. Some
folks do complain that precise cursors are hard to
see against some backgrounds, but you can always
press the Caps Lock key to toggle precise cursors on
or off.
Adjusting transparency and gamut
Photoshop uses colors and patterns to represent infor-
mation about an image that is normally invisible, such as
areas that are transparent, or parts of an image that contain colors that
cannot be represented by your current display or printing system. The
Transparency & Gamut Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 5-12,
enables you to tailor these displays to your own preferences.
For example, transparency is typically shown on-screen by using a gray-and-
white checkerboard pattern. You can change the pattern and colors if you
prefer another type of display.
Here is a rundown of the options you find in this dialog box:
 Grid Size: You can choose small, medium, large, or no grid at all. You
may want to switch from the default medium-sized grid to a large grid if
you’re using a very high-resolution setting (such as the 1920 x 1440

pixel setting I use on my monitor) so the grid is a little easier to see. (I
don’t bother with this, myself.) Or you can switch to a smaller grid if
you’re working at a 640 x 480 or an 800 x 600 resolution.
 Grid Colors: The default light grid is the least obtrusive, but you can
switch to a medium or dark grid if you want. Also, you are not limited 
to gray-and-white checkerboard squares. To choose custom colors,
double-click the white and gray squares below the Grid Colors list.
 Gamut Warning: You can adjust the color used to represent out-of-
gamut colors and to specify the transparency for the warning color.
Double-click the Color box to set the hue and choose the transparency
with the Opacity slider. The gamut warning is generally used before con-
verting RGB images to CMYK to see which colors will be lost. For more
information on color gamuts, see Book II, Chapter 2.
Figure 5-12: Specify how transparency and out-of-gamut (or range) colors are displayed in 
the Transparency & Gamut Preferences dialog box.
A gamut is the range of colors that can be displayed or printed. In Photo-
shop talk, out-of-gamut colors generally are those that can’t be represented
by cyan, magenta, yellow, and black and, therefore, can’t be printed. To turn
gamut warnings on or off, choose View➪Gamut Warning. I recommend leav-
ing the gamut warning on. That way you know what is happening with your
image’s colors.

Setting measurement preferences
In the Units & Rulers Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 5-13, you can
set the units used to measure things on-screen (inches, pixels, millimeters,
and so forth) and to define a default column size when typing text in multi-
ple columns. In addition, you can define the resolution of the image when
you choose File➪New and select a preset from the Preset Sizes list. (See
Book I, Chapter 3 for more on preset sizes.)
Figure 5-13: Specify your units of measurement and default Photoshop resolution settings
from the Units & Rulers Preferences dialog box.
In the Units area of the dialog box, you find these options:
 Rulers: Select the measurement units Photoshop uses for rulers. Your
choices are pixels, inches, centimeters, millimeters, points, picas, or
percent. The most popular sizes are inches and millimeters, but if
you’re working with publications and specifying in picas, you might
prefer that increment instead. If you’re prepping Web graphics, you may
prefer to have your rulers incremented in pixels.
 Type: Choose the measurement used to represent the dimensions of
type. Point size is almost universally used, but pixels and millimeters
are also available. You may want to use pixels if you’re trying to fit type
into a specific-sized area of an image.

Setting Your Preferences
111
In the Column Size area, you can specify the following:
 Width: The width of the column in inches, centimeters, millimeters,
points, or picas.
 Gutter: The width of the area separating columns, also in inches, cen-
timeters, millimeters, points, or picas.
In the New Document Preset Resolutions area, you can set the following:
 Print Resolution: The default is 300 pixels per inch, a good overall print
setting to keep. You can change to another value and use pixels per cen-
timeter as a measurement if you want. Note that this resolution setting
will affect the Photo, International Paper and U.S. Paper presets. Found
in the New dialog box.
 Screen Resolution: Generally, 72 pixels per inch works with most
images that are prepped for screen viewing. You can select another 
resolution and use pixels per centimeter if you like. This resolution set-
ting will affect the Web and Film and Video presets found in the New
dialog box.
Changing the resolution of an image after you created it can impact the
sharpness of your image and degrade quality. Choosing the final resolution
you want when you create a document is best, whether you specify the reso-
lution manually or use these presets.
In the Point/Pica Size area, you can choose whether you want to use a meas-
urement of 72 points per inch (which first became relevant in the Macintosh
realm and spread as desktop publishing became widespread) or the tradi-
tional 72.27 points per inch definition used in the precomputer era. Unless
you have a special reason to choose otherwise, use the Postscript (72 points
per inch) option.
Setting up guides, grids, and slices
Guides are nonprinting lines you can create on your screen to make it easier
to align objects. Grids are vertical and horizontal lines in the background
that make lining up objects even easier. Slices are sections of an image you
can create for Web page graphics so that each slice can be loaded and
treated separately (usually in a table or similar arrangement). The new
Count tool enables you to click on elements on your document and leave 
a non-printing bulleted number on-screen. For more information on using
grids and guides, see Book I, Chapter 4. Figure 5-14 shows the Guides, 
Grid & Slices & Count Preferences dialog box.

sample swatch to choose your own color. You may want to change the
default color if that color is too similar to a dominant color in your

 Style (for guides only): Select from lines or dashed lines. If you work
with images that contain many horizontal and vertical lines that extend
across most of an image, dashed lines may be more visible.

Adding Plug-Ins
Plug-ins are mini software programs that add features to Photoshop.
The Plug-Ins folder is where Photoshop stores all your filters and other plug-
in add-ons. A default folder is created when you install Photoshop.
Photoshop allows you to specify an additional folder to search other than
its own Plug-Ins folder. This additional folder may come in handy if you want
to keep your third-party add-ons separate from Photoshop’s native plug-ins.
An auxiliary plug-ins directory (not nested within Photoshop’s own Plug-Ins
folder) can simplify managing those extra filters, and you can turn off their
use (potentially speeding up Photoshop’s load time) by deselecting the
Additional Plug-Ins Folder check box in this dialog box, as shown in Figure
5-15. You can also use this option when you have some plug-ins installed for
another application and want to share them with Photoshop without having
to make extra copies in your Photoshop Plug-Ins directory.
To activate a new plug-ins directory, select the Additional Plug-Ins Folder
check box and then click the Choose button. In the dialog box that appears,
navigate to the folder you want to use and select it. Click OK. You then need
to exit Photoshop and restart the program to activate the new directory.
If you have a plug-in or folder you’d like to deactivate, use a tilde (~) as the
first character of the plug-in or folder name. Photoshop ignores the plug-
in(s) or folder(s) specified. Just remove the tilde from the name to activate
the plug-in or folder. This can come in handy if you’re having a program
glitch and want to deactivate your plug-ins to troubleshoot whether they are
causing the problem.
Adobe changed the format for serial numbers with Photoshop 7, and if you
have old plug-ins that require a valid Photoshop serial number, you can
enter the serial number from an older version into the space provided in
this dialog box.

 Show Asian Text Options: If unchecked (the default), Photoshop will
hide Asian text options in the Character and Paragraph palettes.
 Enable Missing Glyph Protection: If certain glyphs (characters) are
missing, Photoshop will make a substitution if this option is checked.
 Show Font Names in English: Photoshop will display Asian font names

Using the Preset Manager
Many of the palettes and tools Photoshop works with can use settings that
you store on your hard drive as presets. For example, you can create
custom colors and brush tips, build your own gradients, create a library of
shapes, or compile a set of styles to apply to layers.
You’ll want to become familiar with the
Preset Manager, which provides a cen-
tral management tool for all the
options that are individually available
from the palettes and tools them-
selves. Just as with the tools, you can
select, edit, and delete presets. The
only thing you can’t do with the Preset
Manager is actually create a preset.
You must do this with the Tool Preset
picker or Tool Presets palette. For
more details, see Book I, Chapter 2.

Essentials

T
o me, when people say that a bit of informa-
tion is essential, they mean, “Hey, you really
gotta know this stuff or else!” Well, technically,
you could skip this book and Photoshop wouldn’t
be any wiser, but I don’t recommend it. In this
book, I cover the nitty-gritty of topics like resolu-
tion, image modes, and ﬁle formats. Fun? Nope.
Dry? Most likely, unless you’re the type who gets
excited about pixel dimensions. But having a good
handle on the information in this book is critical
to ensuring good-looking images.
I show you how to safely size your images without
causing them to turn to mush. You can also ﬁnd
information on cropping images and increasing
canvas sizes, as well as an important chapter on
both applying color and color managing your ﬁles.
If you want to know more about how to undo your
mistakes, you’ll want to check out the chapter on
the History palette. And ﬁnally, if all this information
makes your head spin and you need a breather,
look at the chapter on Actions. Actions can auto-
mate a lot of your frequently executed Photoshop
techniques, giving you more time to stop and
smell those roses you just photographed.

S
ize and resolution are slippery subjects. A digital image’s size may refer
to its file size, how big you want it to be on a printed page (such as 3×5
or 8×10 inches), the size you want it be on-screen (full screen or just part of
the screen), or how densely packed the pixels are (its resolution). To use
Photoshop’s tools so that an image looks good in print or on-
screen, you need to know not only what type of size you’re
working with, but also what the image’s resolution is —
and how both of these factors might affect the image’s
appearance.
Given all the factors in size and resolution, it’s not
surprising that Photoshop has evolved into a
Swiss Army knife. It offers multiple tools for speci-
fying, viewing, or changing an image’s size. In this
chapter, I give you a bit of background in both size
and resolution so that you know what tools to use
and how to use them. In Book IX, you can find out
how to use the basics I cover here in order to tailor
size and resolution specifically for print.
I also explain how to change image size without harming your
image. Yes, you can harm your image. Not intentionally, of course.
But it can happen quicker than you can close a dialog box. However, with a
firm understanding of how pixels live and breathe, you can ensure that your
images are safe from any undue damage.

Putting Images under the Microscope
Digital images fall into two camps, vector images, which are created by
mathematical formulas, and raster images, which are made up of pixels
arranged in a grid. Photoshop allows you to produce both types of images
and even to combine both types within a single file. 
Table 1-1 gives you the skinny on vector and raster images. For the details,
keep reading.

Even though Photoshop can produce vector graphics, its primary mission is
to create awe-inspiring raster images. And because the issue of resolution is
so critical to raster images, this chapter primarily discusses methods for
sizing and resizing raster images. I cover producing vector art in more detail
in Book IV, Chapter I.
Vector images
One cool thing about vector images —
also called object-oriented images — is
that when you zoom in on them, they
don’t look blocky. That’s because
vector images are made of segments —
whether curved or straight — and
anchor points — elements that indicate
the endpoints of the segments — all of
which are defined by mathematical
objects called vectors. Vectors use a
unique mathematical formula to define
the specific location of an object as
well as its geometric shape. Vector
images, one of which is shown in
Figure 1-1, are usually the product of
drawing programs such as Adobe
Illustrator, but Photoshop is also capa-
ble of producing a vector or two.
Figure 1-1: Graphics that need clean lines,
such as logos, typographic illustrations,
and line art — such as my logo — work
great in vector format.

Putting Images under the Microscope
121
Here are a few more handy things to know about vector graphics:
 A curve is still a curve, even at 20,000 feet. Because they are mathe-
matically defined, vector graphics can be sized and otherwise trans-
formed without an inkling of quality loss. Take that little 2-inch spot
illustration and size it up to mural size, and it appears identical. 
 You can get pretty pictures in small packages. Vector-image files can
be small because file size depends on the complexity of the vector
objects, not on the size of the illustration.
 Vector images are independent — resolution-independent, that is.
Not only can they be transformed and printed without degrading their
quality, but they also have no built-in resolution — they take on the res-
olution of the output device. For example, print my logo in Figure 1-1 to
an imagesetter (a high-end printing device used for color separations) at
2400 dots per inch (dpi), and the image comes out at 2400 dpi. Print it to
a 300 dpi laser printer and what do you get? A 300 dpi image. 
Because your monitor can only display images on a grid, vector images dis-
play on-screen as pixels. This accounts for the jagged appearance you some-
times see when you zoom into a curved vector object. But don’t worry; it
prints just fine.
Raster images
Raster images are usually the result of the digitizing of continuous-tone
images, such as photographs or original painted or drawn artwork. Raster
images are made up of a grid of squares called pixels. (Pixel is short for 
picture element; it’s the smallest component of a digital image.) If you’ve
ever looked at a bathroom wall made up of those small square tiles reminis-
cent of the ‘40s, you’re familiar with what a grid of pixels looks like up close:
Each pixel lives in a specific location on that grid, and each contains a single
color. When you edit a raster image, you are editing one or more pixels
rather than an object-oriented shape.
But how do you fit a round peg in a square hole? By faking it. Unlike the
true mathematical curve that’s possible when you’re drawing vector
shapes, raster images must try to approximate a curve by mimicking the
overall shape with square pixels. That means the elliptical shapes of my
beanie (shown in Figure 1-2), have to fit within this system of squares.
Fortunately, the pixels’ mimicry is unnoticeable in high-resolution images
viewed at a reasonable distance. But when you zoom in, you can see that a
curve in an image (like the curve of my beanie) is indeed made up of
square pixels.

and Resolution

Viewing Raster Images On-Screen
122
Raster graphics work great for photorealistic or painterly images where
subtle gradations of color are necessary. On the downside, because they
contain a fixed number of pixels, raster graphics can suffer a degradation of
quality when they’re enlarged or otherwise transformed. They are also large
in file size.
Figure 1-2: Raster images are composed of a grid of square pixels.
Bitmap, another name for raster, images are resolution-dependent. Because
they contain a fixed number of pixels, the resolution of the device they are
being printed to is only one of two factors that influence the quality of the
image. The quality of the output also depends heavily on the resolution of
the image. For example, an image with 72 dots per inch (dpi) doesn’t look
any better printed on a 600-dpi printer than it does on a 1200-dpi printer.
Likewise, a 300-dpi image doesn’t look as good printed on an old 72-dpi dot-
matrix printer as it does on a 1200-dpi printer.
Viewing Raster Images On-Screen
When you view images on-screen, pixel dimensions come into play — 
especially if you’re putting images on the Web — because the display of
images is based on 1 image pixel per 1 screen pixel. The most important
issue, then, is making sure that your image fits inside your (or your audi-
ence’s) monitor when viewed at 100%.
When you view an image on-screen, the display size is determined by the
pixel dimension, plus the size and setting of the monitor. You therefore need
to determine what monitor resolution your audience is likely using and size
your graphics accordingly. Table 1-2 illustrates how an 800×600-pixel image
might display differently, depending on monitor resolution.

Using the Image Size Command

800×600
The image fills the screen, with each pixel appearing larger.
15-inch monitor
800×600
The image fills the screen. 
Larger images can’t be viewed in their entirety. 
You may also hear monitor resolution being referred to in graphic display
standards, such as VGA (640×480 pixels), XGA (1024×768 pixels), UXGA
(1600×1200), and so on.
Resolution is measured in pixels per inch, or ppi. You may also run across
the term samples per inch (spi), often used when talking about scanners.
Another term you see often is dots per inch (dpi), always used in reference to
printers, imagesetters, and other paper-outputting devices. You may hear
people refer to dpi as printer resolution.
When displaying images on-screen, the recommended resolution setting is
somewhere between 72 ppi and 96 ppi, even though resolution isn’t really a
factor in preparing screen images. That’s just because monitors display
somewhere in the 72- to 96-ppi range. 
So if you change the physical dimensions of an image, then it is always at a
one to one ratio with the monitor. If you view an image whose resolution is
higher than that of the monitor, the image appears larger on-screen than in
print. For example, try opening (or dragging and dropping) a 300 pixel-per-
inch (ppi) JPEG file into a browser window. It explodes on your screen.
Because the monitor can display only 72 to 96 ppi, it needs a ton of space
to show all the pixels.
Using the Image Size Command
A time will come when you need to mess with the resolution or dimensions
of an image. You may want to 
 Change the file size.
 Make sure the resolution is appropriate for print.
 Adjust the dimensions so they’re just right for viewing on-screen. 
 Change the width, height, and/or resolution of your image for printing
or some other kind of output.

Specifying Size 
and Resolution

Using the Image Size Command
124
Photoshop — powerhouse that it is — allows you to size an image in all
these ways with the Image Size command on the Image menu. Follow these
steps to resize your image:
1. Open the image and then choose
Image➪Image Size.
The Image Size dialog box opens,
as shown in Figure 1-3. This is
where the magic happens.
2. Note the current state of your
image, and decide whether any
of the following values need to
change in order to get a nice-
looking image for the desired
output (print or the Web):
• The current pixel dimensions
and the resulting file size:
Mine shows 1536 pixels in
width and 1024 pixels in height
for a file size of 4.5 MB (megabytes).
• The current document size: This is the size of your image when it
prints on media, such as paper.
• The resolution: Mine is 72 ppi, which is good for displaying on-
screen or on the Web but inadequate for printing. I will see some 
pixelation (visible little squares) on my printout. Therefore, to print,
I need to reduce the size of the image so my total pixels are packed
into a smaller area, to give the image cleaner lines.
3. Make sure the Constrain Proportions check box is selected.
The chain-and-bracket icon in the Document Size area indicate that the
Constrain Proportions check box is selected. Nine times out of ten, you
want your image to stay proportional. With the option selected, chang-
ing one value in the Document Size area makes the other values change
automatically so that the proportions stay intact.
You can also select the Scale Styles check box, which allows you to
scale or not scale any effects or styles that you have applied to your
layer(s). Note that this option is available only if you have checked
Constrain Proportions. (For more on styles, see Book V, Chapter 4.)
4. Make sure that the Resample Image check box is deselected. 
When you resample, you add or delete pixels in the image. Although
sometimes you need to resample, doing so isn’t good for your image
(I explain why in the next section). 
Figure 1-3: The Image Size dialog box is
one of the most important in Photoshop.

Resampling Images
125
5. Enter any new values in the
dialog box.
For example, because I want to
print my image, I enter a new value
of 300 pixels per inch for my reso-
lution in the Document Size area.
Note how the other values auto-
matically change, as shown in
Figure 1-4. 
6. Click OK.
You won’t notice any difference in
the way your image appears on-
screen because you haven’t added
or deleted any pixels; you’ve
merely compacted them into a
smaller space.
Congratulations! You have just safely resized your image. You can
proudly say, “No pixels were harmed in the making of this image.” 
Resampling Images
Resampling means you are changing the pixel dimensions of an image.
When you downsample (or resample down), you are eliminating pixels and
therefore deleting information and detail from your image. When you resam-
ple up (or upsampling), you are adding pixels. Photoshop adds these pixels
by using interpolation. Interpolation means Photoshop analyzes the colors of
the original pixels and “manufactures” new ones, which are then added to
the existing ones.
You can specify the interpolation method in the Image Size dialog box.
The default that appears in the dialog box is based on the interpolation
method you specified in your General Preferences dialog box. Here are your
five choices:
 Nearest Neighbor: This method is fast and provides for the smallest
file size, but it is less precise and therefore of the lowest quality.
This method works by copying the color of the nearest pixel. It can
result in jagged edges, so use it only for images with non-anti-aliased
edges (hard edges).
 Bilinear: Considered a medium-quality method, it works by averaging the
color of the pixel above, below, and to the right and left of each pixel.
 Bicubic: This method is the slowest but most precise. It averages the
color of the pixel above and below and the two on the right and left of
Book II

and Resolution

option prevents your image from becoming
distorted when sized.

each pixel. It provides a smoother transition between pixels but also
increases the contrast between pixels to reduce blurriness.
 Bicubic Smoother: Like Bicubic, but provides an even smoother transi-
tion between pixels and therefore increases the amount of blurriness.
A good method to use when you must upsample images. Can slightly
affect the sharpness of the image.
 Bicubic Sharper: Also similar to Bicubic, but applies less anti-aliasing
and therefore less blurriness as well. This method applies just a little
softening to pixel edges. This is a good method when downsampling
an image.
If you really must resample, especially when upsampling, I recommend leav-
ing the method set to Bicubic Smoother. Notice I said if you really must.
Here are some reasons why you might choose to add or delete pixels:
 You no longer have access to the original artwork, which you could
rescan at the proper resolution and size.
 You no longer have access to the original high-resolution version of
the file.
 You absolutely cannot replace the low-resolution image with another of
higher resolution.

Sharpen➪Smart Sharpen or Unsharp Mask.
These filters heighten the contrast between
pixels to give the illusion of sharpening or
forcing the image more in focus.
 Don’t change your settings — just print. If
you want to leave the size and resolution
settings untouched, but need to print your
image at a different size, use the Scaled
Print size option in the Print dialog box. (For
details, see Book I, Chapter 3.)
 Start out with the proper dimensions.It goes
without saying, but I’ll say it anyway. You
want to try to enter the proper dimensions
and resolution when creating a new docu-
ment. You don’t want to find yourself in the
unfortunate situation of creating your file at
72 ppi, spending hours getting it just per-
fect, and then remembering you were sup-
posed to prep it for print and really needed
it to be 300 ppi. Be sure you scan images at
a high enough resolution too.
 Don’t use a higher resolution than you
need. All you do is create an unnecessar-
ily huge file with a slower print time. In
some cases, it may actually make your
printout look darker and muddier.
 Look no further than this book. Use the
handy, dandy table of recommended reso-
lution settings for a variety of output devices
in Book IX, Chapter 1.

Resampling Images
127
Resampling isn’t a recommended activity, especially when it pertains to
upsampling. I mean as smart as Photoshop is, having to manufacture pixels
is not an exact science. Your image tends to lose detail and sharpness and
get blurry and mushy. Notice the overall blurriness and goopy edges that
are an unfortunate side effect of interpolation, as shown in Figure 1-5. The
bottom line is your resampled image never looks as good as the original.
Downsampling isn’t as scary. You are deleting pixels, and therefore detail,
but the degradation is virtually undetectable to the eye.
Figure 1-5: Fuzzy, blurry images are a result of resampling images.
Adding pixels to an image
To add pixels to an image, follow these
steps:
1. With your desired image open,
first choose Image➪Duplicate to
make a copy of your original.
With the duplicate active, choose
Image➪Image Size.
The Image Size dialog box appears;
see Figure 1-6.
This is where the havoc happens.
Be careful!

Figure 1-6: Checking Resample Image 
enables Photoshop to add pixels to your image.

2. Make sure that the Resample Image option is selected.
The Width and Height in the Pixel Dimensions area are now text boxes
into which you can enter values as well. They are no longer fixed
values, as they are when Resample Image is deselected.
3. Enter a higher value for the reso-
lution, and if desired, enter a
higher value for the width or
height.
I entered a resolution of 300 ppi. 
Note how the pixel dimensions
increased dramatically as did the
file size (from a mere 148.5 KB to
2.52 MB), as shown in Figure 1-7.
If you get all discombobulated
when working in the dialog box,
press Alt (Option on the Mac).
The Cancel button changes to a
Reset button. Click it, and you’re
back to where you started. This is
a good shortcut to remember, as it
holds true for many of Photoshop’s dialog boxes.
4. Leave your Interpolation method set to Bicubic Smoother, which is a
good option when upsampling.
5. Click OK.
Photoshop now goes through its interpolation ritual and churns out a
newly resampled image. Do a side-by-side comparison to the original,
looking at both at 100% view. Your original should look a whole lot
better than the resampled image. And for a real shocker, try printing
out the two images and seeing what kind of degradation takes place.
Taking pixels out of an image
When you downsample you eliminate pixels and therefore delete information
and detail from your image. Although I have emphasized the pitfalls of resam-
pling up, you can sometimes damage your image by downsampling, as well.
Granted, downsampling is sometimes necessary when converting high-
resolution print graphics into Web graphics. For example, you may be
forced to take images used for a corporate brochure and repurpose them
into content for the company’s Web site. You probably won’t notice much
degradation in image quality because the images are just being viewed on-
screen. In addition, downsampling can occasionally camouflage the moiré
patterns caused by scanning halftones (for more on halftones, check out
Book VII, Chapter 1). However, you can downsample to the extreme at
which the images look horrid even on-screen, as shown in Figure 1-8. 
Figure 1-7: Increasing the pixel dimensions
in an image causes your image to degrade
in quality.

Changing the Canvas Size
129
Figure 1-8: You may need to downsample your images to 72 ppi for display on the Web.
You should never need to make an image smaller than 72 ppi.
To remove pixels from an image, follow the steps in the preceding section
and change the image settings accordingly.
If you have to downsample your image significantly, for example to 25% of its
original size, you get better results if you do several successive 50% down-
samples, applying an Unsharp Mask filter on the image in between each
image sizing. (For more on the Unsharp Mask filter, see Book VII, Chapter 1.)
Changing the Canvas Size
I’ve probably harped on you to the point that you’re slightly paranoid, or at
least ultraconscious, of using the Image Size command. Well, you can relax
now because the Canvas Size command is as safe as can be. Unlike the
Image Size command, which enlarges or reduces the dimensions or resolu-
tion of your image, the Canvas Size command merely changes the size of the
canvas, or page, on which the image sits. 
When you increase the size of the canvas, Photoshop fills the expanded area
outside the image with your chosen color. Increasing your canvas size can
come in handy if you are trying to add a frame or border around your image.
If you make the canvas smaller, Photoshop crops (cuts away) the image.
Here are the quick-and-easy steps to changing your canvas size:

1. Choose Image➪Canvas Size.
The Canvas Size dialog box, shown in Figure 1-9, appears. The current
size of your canvas appears at the top of the dialog box.
Figure 1-9: Increasing your canvas size adds to the area around your image.
2. Enter new values in the Width and Height text boxes.
You can also change the unit of measurement by using the pop-up
menus. Select the Relative check box to specify an amount of space for
Photoshop to add or remove around your image. This feature is handy
when you’re adding or removing equal amounts of canvas around
images with fractional measurements.
3. Specify your desired anchor
placement.
The anchor shows how the image
sits inside the canvas. By default,
Photoshop centers the image and
adds or removes the canvas
around it. Click any of the other
eight squares to have Photoshop
add or remove the canvas asym-
metrically around the image, as
shown in Figure 1-10.
If you reduce either the Width or
Height value and click OK, an alert
box appears asking if you really
want to proceed because you will
be clipping the image. This is actually another way of cropping an
image, albeit not one you will use everyday.

the size of your canvas symmetrically or
asymmetrically around your image.

4. Choose your canvas color from the Canvas Extension Color pop-up
menu and click OK.
Choose from Foreground, Background, White, Black, Gray, or Other. If
you select Other, Photoshop transports you to the Color Picker where
you can choose any color you desire. Note that the small swatch to the
right of the pop-up menu displays the current background color. You can
also click this swatch to access the Color Picker (which I explain how to
use in Book II, Chapter 3).
Cropping an Image
Even a novice photographer knows
that cropping an image can make a
composition stronger. Cropping entails
cutting away background clutter or
endless expanses of empty space in
order to focus in on your desired 
subject.
This simple process can transform a
ho-hum photograph into a visually
exciting one. Take a look at my exam-
ple in Figure 1-11. I mean, it doesn’t
take an Ansel Adams to figure out
which image is stronger. (It would be
even better if the fence weren’t in the background, but hey, that’s nothing
that a little Photoshop retouching can’t take care of. Check out Book VIII; it’s
all about retouching and restoration techniques.)
Using the Crop tool
The most popular way to crop an image is by using the Crop tool. This simple
tool is as easy and effective to use as a T square and X-ACTO knife, and with-
out the possibility of bodily injury. Select the Crop tool in the Tools palette
or press C on the keyboard. Then follow these steps:
1. With the Crop tool, drag around the part of the image you want to
keep and then release your mouse button.
As you drag, a marquee (a dotted outline) appears displaying the crop-
ping boundaries. Don’t worry if your cropping marquee isn’t exactly 
correct. You can adjust it in the next step.
Notice how the area outside the cropping marquee appears darker
than the inside in order to better frame your image. Adobe calls this a
shield. You control the color and opacity (the amount of transparency)
of the shield by adjusting the settings on the Options bar. If, for some

ways to improve the composition of your

strange reason, you don’t want
the shield, deselect the check
box. Figure 1-12 shows a great
example of way too much back-
ground clutter. I dragged around
the only thing I want to retain —
the birthday girl.
2. Adjust the cropping marquee by
dragging the handles.
The small squares on the sides
and corners of the cropping mar-
quee are called handles. When you
hover your mouse over any handle
or the marquee itself, your cursor
changes to a double-headed arrow,
indicating that you can drag. 
To move the entire marquee, posi-
tion your mouse inside the marquee until you see a black arrowhead
cursor and then drag. Adjust the marquee until you’re satisfied.
You can also drag the origin point (the circle icon in the center) to
change the axis of rotation.
If you move your mouse outside the mar-
quee, the cursor changes to a curved,
double-headed arrow. Dragging with this
cursor rotates the marquee. This feature
can be extremely useful when you need to
rotate and crop a crooked image. By using
the Crop tool, you can perform both com-
mands in one step and often more quickly
and accurately. Just be aware that rotation,
unless it’s in 90-degree increments, resam-
ples your image, which, if done repeatedly,
can damage your image (see the earlier sec-
tion, “Resampling Images,” for more on
resampling). Getting the rotation right the
first time around is for the best.
3. Double-click inside the cropping marquee. 
You can also just press Enter (Return on the
Mac) or click the Commit (check mark icon)
button on the Options bar. Photoshop dis-
cards the area outside the marquee, as
shown in Figure 1-13. If you want to cancel
the crop, just press Esc or click Cancel (the
slashed circle icon) on the Options bar.

background clutter allows you
to hone in on your subject.

Cropping with the Marquee tool
If you get bored using the Crop tool, you can also crop a selected area by
choosing Image➪Crop. Simply make a selection with any of the tools and
then choose this command. Although using the Rectangular Marquee tool
for your selection makes the most sense, you don’t have to. 
You can use Image➪Crop with any selection — circular, polygonal, kidney
bean, even feathered. Photoshop can’t crop to those odd shapes, but it gets
as close to the outline as it can. (For all you need to know on selections, see
Book III, Chapter 1.)
Using the Trim command
The fabulous Trim trims away transparent or solid-colored areas around
your image. Choose Image➪Trim, and a dialog box appears. Select
Transparent Pixels (for layered images), Top Left Pixel Color, or Bottom

Sure-fire cropping tips
Even though cropping is about as simple an
image-editing maneuver as you can get, you
need to know about a few other options:
 If you need a nonrectangular cropping mar-
quee, select the Perspective check box on
the Options bar (your crop marquee must be
active). This feature allows the corner han-
dles to move independently. 
 The Front Image option enables you to crop
one image so that it’s the exact same size as
another image. Open two images and crop
the first one. Click Front Image. Photoshop
enters the width, height, and resolution
values from the first image on the Options bar.
Drag the Crop tool on your second image and
adjust the marquee as desired. Double-click
inside the marquee. Photoshop automatically
crops your second image to match your first.
 If your image doesn’t contain any layers —
that is, it consists only of a background —
any cropped areas are permanently deleted
from your file. However, if your image 
consists of one or more layers (see Book V
for the lowdown on layers), you have the
choice of deleting or hiding your cropped
area. Delete eliminates the cropped areas,
whereas Hide just hides the cropped area.
You can see the cropped area if you move
the layer with the Move tool. Another way
to see the hidden area is to choose
Image➪Reveal All. Photoshop expands the
canvas to show all areas in all layers. These
options are available only while the crop
marquee is active.
 If you want to crop an image to an exact
measurement, enter a value in the Width,
Height, and Resolution text boxes on the
Options bar. Note that these options are
available only when the Crop tool is active
and you haven’t yet dragged a cropping
marquee. But again, be careful about the
value you use for the Resolution setting.
Remember, resampling is not a good thing.
To remove the entered settings, click the
Clear button on the Options bar.

Right Pixel Color as a basis for the trim. Next, instruct Photoshop to trim
away the Top, Bottom, Left, or Right side(s) from the image. 
This command works great for quickly eliminating black-and-white borders
around images, as shown in Figure 1-14.
Using the Crop and Straighten Photo Command
Choose File➪Automate➪Crop and Straighten Photos. Photoshop then 
looks for rectangular areas in your document, extracts each one into its 
own document, and then straightens those individual images, as shown in
Figure 1-15. 
The Crop and Straighten Photos command is fabulous if you want to save
time by scanning multiple images initially into one document (and the com-
mand works on single images as well). This command is a real manual-labor
timesaver, and I wholeheartedly endorse it.

Chapter 2: Choosing Color 
Modes and File Formats
In This Chapter
 Understanding the theory of color
 Taking a look at color modes
 Focusing on file formats
I
n addition to choosing a size and resolution (discussed in the previous
chapter), you need to decide on a color mode and file format for your
image. This decision is usually based on the final use for the image. Are you
importing it into a page-layout program for offset printing? Posting it on a
Web page? Using it for a newspaper article?
When you know an image’s final destination, you can make
intelligent choices of which color mode and file format are
best. This chapter gives you some background informa-
tion to help you make those choices so you don’t end
up having to do extra work, spend extra time, or
waste extra money.
Selecting a Color Mode
Every file has a color mode, also called an image
mode or just plain mode. To determine the color
mode of an image, look in the title bar of the image
window or choose Image➪Mode. Color modes define
the color values used to display the image. Photoshop
offers eight different modes, and enables you to convert
images from one mode to another. The color mode you choose
for a particular image depends on a couple of factors:
 The file format you plan to save it in. Some modes call for specific file
formats. You may find that a certain format is unavailable because your
file isn’t in the appropriate color mode.
 The end use for the image. Do you plan to post the image on the Web?
Or are you putting it in a brochure that will be offset printed? For more
on prepping images for print, see Book IX, Chapter 1.

Selecting a Color Mode
138
The next few sections provide a brief description and example of each mode
and any file-format or usage connections.
Color modes affect the number of colors that are displayed, as well as the
size of the file and the number of channels. One or more channels — in
which the color data is stored — represent each mode. Grayscale images
have one color channel — Black. CMYK images have four color channels —
Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. (For the lowdown on channels, see Book VI,
Chapter 1.)
RGB Color
Uses: RGB is the gold standard for most scanners, all monitors, digital 
cameras, and some desktop inkjet printers. And it’s the primary color
mode (with Indexed Color being secondary) to use with any images to
be viewed on-screen (whether on the Web or in any kind of multimedia 
presentation).
File formats: Just about every file format, except GIF, can handle an image
in RGB mode.
Basic RGB and CMYK color theory
When you view an RGB image, you are looking
at an image made up of three colors — red,
green, and blue. These colors are
 The primary colors of light
 The colors that correspond to the three
types of cones inside your eyes
 The colors that comprise white light from
the sun
 The colors your monitor uses when dis-
playing images
The CMYK color scheme is based on the light-
absorbing quality of ink on paper. In theory, a
white light hits these inks. Some visible wave-
lengths are absorbed, or subtracted, while
others are reflected back to your eyes. CMYK
images comprise various percentages of only
four colors of ink — cyan, magenta, yellow, and
black. These colors correspond to the inks used
in the offset printing process.

Selecting a Color Mode
139
RGB is a very good overall work mode. Images in RGB mode have full access
to all Photoshop commands, including filters and image adjustments. RGB
images contain values of 0–255 for each of three colors — red, green, and
blue. With 8 bits of color information for each of the three colors, these 
24-bit images can reproduce up to 16.7 million colors on-screen. And 48-bit
images (16 bits per color) can display even more. Most scanners also scan
images in RGB, all monitors display in RGB, and some desktop inkjet print-
ers prefer to print RGB (rather than CMYK) images. 
The RGB mode in Photoshop varies according to the RGB Working Space
setting you have selected in the Color Settings dialog box. For details on
color settings, see Book II, Chapter 3.
Note that in CS3, RGB also supports High Dynamic Range, or HDR, (32-bit
per color) images.
CMYK Color
Uses: CMYK is the standard for images
that are color-separated for offset
printing.
File formats: CMYK can handle just
about every format except GIF.
CMYK images, shown in Figure 2-1,
contain a percentage of one or more
four-process color inks — cyan,
magenta, yellow, and black. Darker
colors have higher percentages,
whereas lighter colors have lower 
percentages. Pure white is created
when all four colors have a value of
0%. Many other composite printing
devices also require images to be in
CMYK mode. Again, like RGB mode,
remember that the CMYK mode in
Photoshop can vary according to
the CMYK Working Space setting you
have selected in the Color Settings
dialog box.

Selecting a Color Mode

Make sure that you do all your image editing in RGB mode, where you have
access to the full range of filters. When you complete your editing, convert
the image from RGB to CMYK. (For details, see “Converting from RGB to
CMYK,” later in this chapter.)
Grayscale
Uses: Grayscale mode, shown in
Figure 2-2, is for black-and-white
(and all shades of gray in between)
images.
File formats: All the most com-
monly used file formats accept
Grayscale mode.
Grayscale images contain up to
256 levels of gray. Each pixel has a
brightness value ranging from 0
(black) to 255 (white). You can scan
an image in Grayscale mode, or you
can convert color images to grayscale.
If you convert a color image to
grayscale, Photoshop discards all the
color information, and the remaining
gray levels represent the luminosity of
the pixels. (Check out the “Converting
to grayscale” section, later in this
chapter.) You can also convert a grayscale image to a color image, which,
while it doesn’t convert your grayscale image to color, it enables you to
apply color on top of the grayscale image.
Note that in CS3, HDR images can also support Grayscale mode.
Monotone, Duotone, Tritone, and Quadtone
Uses: Because printing presses can print only about 50 gray levels per ink
color, duotones and multitones — which use two to four inks — are used to
increase the range of tones of grayscale images. Duotones and multitones
are often created by using black and spot colors (premixed inks), although
you can also use process colors. (For more on spot colors, see Book IX,
Chapter 1.)
File formats: The only file formats that can save duotones, tritones, and
quadtones are native Photoshop, Photoshop 2.0, EPS, PDF, Large Document
Format, or Photoshop Raw.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 2-2: Images in grayscale mode
contain 256 levels of gray.

Selecting a Color Mode
141
These modes create one-color, (mono-
tone), two-color (duotone), three-color
(tritone), shown in Figure 2-3, and four-
color (quadtone) images. Note that
Photoshop lumps all the various “tone”
modes under duotone. You can find a
pop-up menu in the Duotone options
dialog box where you can select the
various options. Unlike RGB and CMYK
images where the components of the
image display with different colors, the
monotones, duotones, tritones, and
quadtones have the colors mixed
throughout the image. The colored
inks are used to reproduce tinted
grays, not the different colors you find
in RGB and CMYK images.
To access the Duotone mode, you
must first convert the color image to
grayscale by choosing Image➪
Mode➪Grayscale. Then choose Image➪Mode➪Duotone. In the dialog box
that appears, choose Monotone, Duotone, Tritone, or Quadtone from the
pop-up menu. Next, select ink colors — either spot or process — by clicking
the appropriate swatches. Finally, you can adjust the curves settings and
tell Photoshop how to distribute the ink(s) among the various tones. Note
that you do not have access to the individual color channels in Duotone
mode. The only manipulation you can do in that mode is to specify the
curve settings.
If you are new to these modes, you need to know that Photoshop offers
numerous preset duotones, tritones, and quadtones. To access these pre-
sets, click the Load button and go to the Duotones folder (which is located
in the Presets folder in the Photoshop folder). Sometimes printing these
types of images can be challenging so starting with these presets is a good
idea if you’re inexperienced. 
Indexed Color
Uses: Indexed Color mode is primarily for Web graphics and multimedia 
displays.
File formats: Indexed Color mode supports a variety of formats, with GIF
being the most popular. Other formats supported include Photoshop,
Photoshop 2.0, Photoshop Raw, BMP, EPS, ElectricImage, Large Document
Format, PCX, PDF, PICT, PICT Resource, PNG, Targa, and TIFF.

Figure 2-3: Tritone images use three inks
that are mixed throughout the image.

Selecting a Color Mode
142
Indexed Color mode, shown in
Figure 2-4, uses 256 colors or less; what
graphics aficionados call 8-bit color.
When you convert an image to indexed
color, Photoshop builds a Color Lookup
Table (CLUT), which stores and indexes
the color. (Note the Color Table option
in the Mode menu.) If a color in the
original image isn’t in the table,
Photoshop chooses the closest match
or makes a new one from the available
colors. Using fewer colors reduces the
file size, which is why the GIF file
format — a very popular Web-graphics
format — uses this mode. (See the
“GIF” section, later in this chapter.)
The Indexed Color mode does not sup-
port layers, and editing capabilities
are limited. For more on indexed color,
see Bonus Chapter 1. The book’s
Introduction has details about the companion Web site.
Lab Color
Uses: Lab Color mode provides a consistent color display, which is ideal for
high-end retouching of images.
File formats: You can save an image in Lab Color mode in native Photoshop,
Photoshop Raw, EPS, TIFF, PDF, JPEG
2000, Large Document Format, or
Photoshop DCS 1.0 and 2.0 formats. You
can save images containing 48 bits (16
bits per channel) in Photoshop,
Photoshop Raw, Large Document
Format, and TIFF formats.
Lab Color mode is usually thought of as
the internal color mode Photoshop uses
when converting from one color mode
to another — for example, when going
from RGB to CMYK. It is also the mode
preferred by color-retouching experts
because it is considered to be device-
independent (it appears consistent on
various devices).

256 colors or less.
Figure 2-5: Lab Color mode is the
preferred editing mode for color experts
because it’s device-independent.

Selecting a Color Mode
143
Lab Color mode consists of a lightness channel and two additional channels,
a and b, shown in Figure 2-5, which contain the range of color from green to
red (a) and blue to yellow (b).
HDR images containing 32-bit per color, have been given more support in
CS3. You can save them in Photoshop, Large Document Format, Portable
Bitmap and TIFF file formats. See more on HDR images in Book XI, Chapter 2.
Bitmap
Uses: This mode is best for scanned line art (that is, art composed entirely
of lines, such as a line drawing of a camera you might see in a manual) and
signatures (your John Hancock). 
When scanning line art be sure and crank up your scanning resolution to
1200 dpi or so to ensure a good-quality bitmap image.
File formats: Photoshop, Photoshop
2.0, EPS, TIFF, PDF, BMP, PNG, GIF, PNG
Large Document Format, PCX, PICT,
PICT Resource, Portable Bitmap, and
Wireless Bitmap.
Bitmap images contain pixels that are
either black or white, exclusively. You
must convert color images to
grayscale before you can access
Bitmap mode. Upon choosing
Image➪Mode➪Bitmap, a dialog box
appears, offering options for resolution
and method. The various methods
give different appearances, one of
which is shown in Figure 2-6, so try
each one to see which you prefer.
When you choose Custom Pattern,
you can then choose a pattern from
the drop-down menu.
If you save a file in Bitmap mode as an
EPS (see “EPS,” later in this chapter), you can convert the white areas in
the image to transparent areas. Transparency enables you to overlay the
file over a background containing color or an image, and only the dark
pixels show.

Converting to a Different Color Mode

Multichannel
Uses: Multichannel mode is for special
printing needs or as an intermediate
mode when converting between differ-
ent color modes.
File formats: The only file formats
available for multichannel images are
native Photoshop, Photoshop 2.0,
Photoshop DCS 2.0, Large Document
Format, or Photoshop Raw formats.
The Multichannel mode, shown in
Figure 2-7, comprises multiple grayscale
channels, each containing 256 levels
of gray. Whenever you delete or mix
channels, you end up with a multi-
channel image. You can also convert
any image with more than one channel
to this mode. In a multichannel image,
each channel becomes a spot channel,
with 256 levels of gray.
For more on channels, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
Converting to a Different Color Mode
Sometimes your image starts out in one color mode and then you find you
need to convert the image to another mode. Maybe you have to strip the
color out of an image you’re submitting to the local newspaper. Or maybe
you have to convert your RGB image to CMYK to get it ready for an offset
print job.
When you convert modes, you are permanently changing the color values in
your image, so save a backup image just in case.
The next few sections offer pointers for the most common conversions
you’ll make. If you want to convert an image into an indexed color for the
Web, your best bet is to use the Save for Web option, which I cover in Bonus
Chapter 1.

Converting from RGB to CMYK
As I mention several times in this book, CMYK is the image mode necessary
for high-end composite printing and offset printing. You first want to perform
all your necessary image-editing tasks in RGB mode for the following reasons:
 The image size is smaller because RGB mode has only three channels.
 The RGB color space provides more device independence because it
isn’t reliant on inks.
 You have full accessibility to filters and image adjustments.
 RGB mode provides a large color gamut, so Photoshop preserves more
colors after it makes image adjustments.
When you finish editing the image in RGB mode, you can convert the image
from RGB to CMYK (you can perform any fine-tuning in CMYK mode if neces-
sary). If you’re new to this procedure, you may be surprised at what can
result. Because the color gamut (range of colors) of the RGB model (16.7 mil-
lion) is much larger than that of CMYK (approximately 55,000), you may see
a color shift, which may range from slight to major.
The extent of the shift depends on the colors in the RGB image and how
many of them are out of gamut. Photoshop replaces RGB colors that are out
of gamut with the closest match available within the CMYK gamut, often
replacing the electric blues, fiery reds, and sunny yellows with duller, mud-
dier CMYK equivalents. Unfortunately, you can’t do anything to prevent this.
It is just the way of the world of color. However, if you can select colors
(rather than acquiring them from a scan), be sure that you don’t select any
colors that are out of gamut to begin with. You can also soft proof colors
(preview the effects of your CMYK conversion without actually converting)
by choosing View➪Proof Setup➪Working CMYK. Check out Book II, Chapter 3
for details about selecting colors and soft proofing. 
Converting to grayscale
You can convert a color image to grayscale a multitude of ways, as shown in
Figure 2-8. The next few sections cover a few that you may want to try out.
Quick-and-dirty method
Choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. Photoshop then asks you whether you
want to discard color information. Click Discard. If your image contains mul-
tiple layers, Photoshop first asks whether you want to merge your layers.
If you want to keep your layers, click the Don’t Merge button.

Figure 2-8: Photoshop gives you many ways to convert a color image to grayscale.
Although this method does the job in stripping color from your image, you
may be left with an image that is flat and lacking contrast. You can apply a
Levels adjustment (choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels) to boost the con-
trast, or you can try one of the other conversion methods. 
Be aware that you can no longer apply color to your image after you con-
vert it. If you choose a color in the Color palette, the color appears gray in
the foreground and background color icons. If you want to apply color to
your grayscale image, convert it back to RGB or CMYK mode.
Lab Color mode method
This method most likely provides a better grayscale image than the quick-
and-dirty method. Make sure that you finish all your edits requiring layers
before you follow these steps:
1. Choose Image➪Mode➪Lab Color. 
As I mention earlier, converting to Lab Color mode converts the chan-
nels into a lightness channel and a and b channels containing ranges of
color. Note that if you have layers, you will be prompted if you want to
merge or not merge your layers. You can choose either option, since in
Step 2, you’ll have to flatten the image if you want to proceed with the
operation. For details on working with layers, see Book V.

2. Delete the a channel. 
Again, if you have layers, click OK to flatten your layers. If you choose
Cancel, you will abort the operation.
If you delete the A channel, the b channel then changes its name to
Alpha 2. 
3. Delete the Alpha 2 channel. 
That leaves you with the lightness channel, which is now named Alpha 1. 
4. Choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. 
Your color image is now a grayscale one. 
Best channel method
If you look at the individual channels in the image, one often stands out as
being a very good grayscale image by itself. (If channels are a mystery to
you, check out Book VI, Chapter 1 for details.) You may find that the Red
channel provides a good grayscale image when the subject is people,
because humans have a lot of red in their skin. Or you may find the Green
channel looks good in a scenic shot. The Blue channel rarely yields a nice
image, though. Most of the crud picked up in a digital image finds its way
into the Blue channel.
In the Channels palette, select each channel and view its contents. Find the
channel that looks the best and then choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. If you
have layers, Photoshop asks if you want to flatten your layers. Click OK.
Photoshop then asks whether you want to discard all the other channels.
Click OK. 
You can also use the Channel Mixer to create custom grayscale images.
For more on the Channel Mixer, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
Finally, Photoshop has given us yet one more way to convert to grayscale,
via the new Black & White feature under the Image➪Adjustments submenu.
For details, see Book VIII, Chapter 1.
Using the Conditional Mode Change command
Photoshop enables you to specify instances where one mode changes into
another so that you can utilize the conversion command in an action. Briefly,
an action is a collection of recorded and saved commands that you can
replay again and again. (For details on actions, see Book II, Chapter 5.)
Sometimes when you incorporate a mode conversion as part of an action,
you get an error message because the file you’re opening may not have the

same mode you specified as the source mode in the action. For example,
you may have specified CMYK as your source mode in the action. But if the
action opens a file in Grayscale mode, you get an error message, because
the Grayscale mode of the file doesn’t match the CMYK source mode. The
Conditional Mode Change command takes care of this problem. Here’s what
you do to add this command to your action:
1. Start creating and recording your
action. 
2. Choose File➪Automate➪
Conditional Mode Change. 
The Conditional Mode Change
dialog box, shown in Figure 2-9,
appears.
3. Select the mode(s) you want as
valid for the source mode. 
Other options include the All or
None buttons to select (respec-
tively) all modes or no modes. 
4. Select your desired target mode
from the Mode pop-up menu. 
5. Click OK. 
If all goes well, Photoshop incorporates the Conditional Mode Change
command as a step in your action.
Choosing the Right File Format
A critical component in saving a file is choosing the file format. The file
format is the way the file’s data is represented and saved. Photoshop gener-
ously offers numerous file formats to choose from. Some you’ll use frequently,
and others you’ll probably never set eyes on. I provide quite a bit of detail
on the formats you’ll use most frequently. 
Note that if a file format doesn’t appear in the Open, Save, or another dialog
box, you may need to install the optional plug-in for that particular format.
TIFF
TIFF, Tagged Image File Format, is by far one of the best and most useful for-
mats. One of the great qualities of TIFFs is that they are and have always
been totally cross-platform. In addition, almost every program on the
planet can import TIFFs. Okay, so that’s a slight exaggeration. Almost every
Figure 2-9: Include the Conditional Mode
Change command in your action to ensure
all images are processed regardless of the
image’s mode.

Choosing the Right File Format
149
word-processing, presentation, page-layout, drawing, painting, and image-
editing program can import TIFFs. This file format works especially well for
printed or color-separated images.
Photoshop enables you to save layers
and transparency (explained in detail
in Book V) and also use various meth-
ods of compression. You have the
option of having Photoshop warn you
that including layers increases your file
size. To enable this option, select the
Ask Before Saving Layered TIFF Files
check box in the File Handling section
of the Preferences dialog box.
Photoshop saves the layers along
with a flattened version of the image.
Be aware that some applications may
display only the flattened version
(in which case transparency isn’t 
preserved).
It should come as no surprise that the
most commonly used format offers a
variety of options — all of which are
available in the TIFF Options dialog
box (shown in Figure 2-10). The follow-
ing sections give you everything you
need to know about your various options so you can make an informed deci-
sion, based on your intended uses for the image.
Image Compression
Compression makes your file sizes smaller, but at a cost. If your files are
unusually large, compressing them makes them save and open more slowly.
Note that TIFF files can be up to 4 GB in size. Be careful, however, because
older versions of Photoshop and other applications don’t support file sizes
larger than 2 GB.
Photoshop offers three methods of compression, besides the option of
None, which of course leaves your image uncompressed:
 LZW: This method has been around for eons and is a lossless compres-
sion scheme, which means that data is not deleted to make your file
smaller. LZW is especially good for compressing images with large areas
of a single color. Most programs that support TIFF also support LZW
compression, so you can use this method without much hesitation.
Book II
Chapter 2
Choosing Color
Modes and File
Formats
Figure 2-10: The TIFF dialog box offers a
multitude of options for saving TIFFs.

Choosing the Right File Format
150
 Zip: Zip compression is also a lossless method and is popular in the
Windows arena. Like LZW, it works well with images that have large
areas of a single color.
 JPEG: This method, while popular and very effective, is a lossy com-
pression process. When compressing, JPEG deletes data to reduce the
file size. (That’s where the loss in lossy comes from.) JPEG compression
is a cumulative compression scheme which means that it recompresses
every time it saves. Over time this can degrade image quality.
I recommend that you stick with LZW compression if possible. If you
need to create a JPEG however, minimize the degradation of lossy com-
pression by leaving your image in either TIFF or native Photoshop file
formats while editing. Then, when you’re completely done editing and
you need to compress the image, save the file as a JPEG at a high-to-
maximum-quality setting.
Pixel Order
Specify how Photoshop arranges the data in the color channels of the TIFF
file. Interleaved stores the samples from individual channels interleaved
with each other (for example RGBRGBRGB). Planar stores them consecu-
tively (for example RRRGGGBBB). Previously Photoshop wrote all TIFFs as
interleaved. But planar offers better compression and speed, and Adobe
swears that all applications support the format.
Byte Order
Byte order is the way bits of data are arranged and stored. Specify whether
you want to save the TIFF for a Mac or a PC. If you want to be able to use
the image on both platforms, select IBM PC. Macs are much more forgiving
when exchanging files.
Save Image Pyramid
This option enables you to save multiple resolutions of an image. The top of
the pyramid is the lowest resolution, and the bottom of the pyramid is the
highest resolution. If the program supports them, you can choose to open
any of the resolutions. Photoshop can open only the image at the highest
resolution within the file. I recommend leaving this option deselected.
Save Transparency
Select this option to preserve transparent areas when the TIFF is opened in
other applications. Of course, those applications must also support trans-
parency. If you open a TIFF with transparency in Photoshop, the transparent
areas are always preserved whether or not you select the option. Note that
this option is disabled if your image has no transparent areas.

Choosing the Right File Format
151
Layer Compression
If your file has layers and you choose to save them, you have the choice of
RLE (Run Length Encoding) or Zip compression. Because RLE compression
is also lossless, you have the choice of faster saves (RLE) or smaller files
(Zip). The last choice is for Photoshop to discard the layers, thereby flatten-
ing the image and then saving it as a copy. Your original layered file also
remains intact. This option is disabled if your image has no layers.
JPEG
JPEG, the acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group, is a file format that
uses lossy compression (explained in the “Image Compression” section).
The JPEG file format offers 13 compression settings — the higher the qual-
ity, the less the compression, and vice versa.
JPEG compression is very effective. It can squeeze your file size to practi-
cally nothing. But because the compression is lossy, I don’t recommend this
format for high-end printing. JPEG supports RGB, CMYK, and Grayscale
image modes.
If you want to post your image on the Web, you have to save it as a JPEG,
GIF, or PNG. JPEG works great with photographic images that have a wide
range of colors. You’re better off using the Save for Web feature when saving
as a JPEG. You think 13 levels of compression is a lot? With Save for Web,
you get around 100 levels of compression along with some other options.
Check out Bonus Chapter 1 for the lowdown on all the JPEG options and set-
tings. The Introduction offers details about the book’s companion Web site.
JPEG 2000
JPEG 2000 is a cousin to standard JPEG; it provides a few more bells and
whistles, including better compression rates and more quality settings.
In addition to the standard lossy compression algorithms, JPEG 2000 also
offers lossless compression, shown in Figure 2-11, and can support 16-bit
images, alpha and spot channels, and transparency (8 bit-images only).
You can save this format using the following image modes: RGB, CMYK,
Grayscale, and Lab Color. If you want to utilize this file format, be sure to
install this optional plug-in; it’s on the Photoshop CS3 Install CD.
One of the coolest features of this format is its support of a Region of Interest
(ROI). This feature enables you to selectively choose a region of an image
that you can then optimize to ensure the best quality. You save an alpha
channel (explained in Book VI) to define that vital portion of the image
where detail retention is critical. You can then compress the rest of the
image more heavily and with lesser quality, resulting in a smaller file size.
For more details on JPEG 2000, see Bonus Chapter 1.

Figure 2-11: The JPEG 2000 format is a souped-up version of an old favorite.
Although praising the qualities of JPEG 2000 is all well and good, be warned
that you currently need a plug-in to view these files on the Web and support
is still spotty. In the future, this format may become a standard for the Web
and digital cameras.
GIF
GIF is another file format used for Web graphics. GIFs support transparency —
but on the down side, you must save GIFs in the Indexed Color mode, which
offers only 256 colors (or even fewer). Although this format is great for
making tiny files, it’s not so great for continuous-tone images where the
number of colors displayed is critical. Therefore, the GIF format is usually
reserved for illustrations (spot illustrations, buttons, logos, and so on) and
type with large areas of flat colors and sharp details. For the whole story on
GIFs, see Bonus Chapter 1.
EPS
EPS is short for Encapsulated PostScript. PostScript is a page-description lan-
guage developed by Adobe and used by many printers. The EPS format can
contain both vector and raster graphics. (For details on vector and raster

Choosing the Right File Format

graphics, see Book II, Chapter 1.) EPSs tend to create larger file sizes and
do not have a built-in compression scheme like JPEGs or TIFFs. EPS is a 
recommended file format for creating color separations for high-end, four-
color print jobs. This is also the file format to use for images with clipping
paths (explained in Book III) and one of the few formats that supports
Duotone mode. In addition to duotones, EPS supports Lab Color, CMYK,
RGB, Indexed Color, Grayscale, DCS, and Bitmap modes. It does not support
alpha channels. Finally, EPS is the format of choice for importing to and from
drawing programs such as Illustrator, FreeHand, and CorelDraw.
Here are the options when saving in the
EPS format, as shown in Figure 2-12:
 Preview: If you import your EPS
into another application, this
option provides a low-resolution
image for you to view. I recom-
mend choosing 8-bit TIFF, which
works on both PC and Mac.
 Encoding: This option specifies
the way an image is sent to the
PostScript printer. Choose Binary
if you can; it produces smaller
files and keeps all original data. If
you’re having printing problems, choose ASCII. JPEG compresses the
file, but discards data and may cause color-separation problems. Avoid
it if possible.
 Include Halftone Screen and Include Transfer Function: Use these
options for offset print jobs. Let your friendly service bureau or com-
mercial printing expert specify these options.
 Transparent Whites: If your image is in Bitmap color mode, this option
enables white areas to appear transparent.
 PostScript Color Management: This option converts the file’s color data
to the printer’s color space. I do not recommend selecting this option if
you are importing your image into a document that is color managed.
(For more on color management, see Book II, Chapter 3.)
 Include Vector Data: When selected, this option preserves any vector
graphics, such as type and shapes. However, it is preserved only when
you import the file into another program. If you reopen the EPS in
Photoshop, however, your vector data is rasterized.
 Image Interpolation: This option anti-aliases low-resolution images —
softens their edges when they’re printed.

PDF: The universal donor
PDF is the acronym for Portable Document Format, which is the native
format of Adobe Acrobat. This format, developed by Adobe, can contain
editable text, vector, and raster data. PDF files are often used for electronic
documentation that will be downloaded from the Web. You’ve probably
noticed that every Adobe Help document is in PDF format, and if you’re a
Web user, you’ve probably downloaded more than a few PDFs. Even the gov-
ernment, notoriously slow to catch on to new technology, has embraced
PDF. The military uses PDFs for technical documentation. And all your tax
forms are available as downloadable PDFs.
You might be thinking, “So what? I’m into images, not documents.” Well,
hold on a second. PDFs can be extremely useful in the imaging world as
well. Anyone with a computer running Windows, Mac OS, or Unix can 
read a PDF. All you need to view a PDF file is Adobe Acrobat Reader,
which is available as a free download from the Adobe Web site. If you
save your image as a PDF and e-mail it (or post it on the Web as a down-
loadable file) to a colleague, manager, client, or friend, that person can see
your image — colors, fonts, and all — exactly the way you see it. The other
nice thing about PDFs is that they have an automatic compression process
that makes the files small and manageable for mail transfer or loading on
the Web.
When you save a file as a Photoshop PDF, you have all the same save options
of the native Photoshop format. PDF supports layers, alpha channels, and
annotations, so select these options if you have any. It also supports the
same image modes as the native Photoshop format. In addition, you can
now also save 16-bit images as PDF. After choosing your initial options, you
then get an alert dialog box that informs you that the settings you just
chose may be overridden by the settings you choose next.
The Save Adobe PDF dialog box offers a multitude of options than ever
before. The options you find in this dialog box are similar to the ones in
other Adobe applications, such as Illustrator and InDesign. 
At the top of the dialog box are settings for presets, standards, and compati-
bility as shown in Figure 2-13:
 Adobe PDF Preset: Choose a preset setting from the pop-up menu.
Photoshop then kindly gives you a description of that setting and what
versions of Acrobat can open that PDF. The default setting of High
Quality Print creates PDF files suitable for good-quality printing on
desktop printers. Unless you want to specifically create a PDF to view
on-screen or e-mail for approval purposes, in which case you choose
Smallest File Size, stick with the default as an overall setting.

PDFX is an ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standard
for graphic content exchange designed for the prepress purpose workflow.
This subset of PDF enables what Adobe calls a blind exchange of files,
meaning that all content and criteria that makes up the PDF is enclosed
in one file. The advantage of this format is that it eliminates much of the
font and color issues that could potentially lead to printing problems.
Ask your service provider or offset print house if it prefers one of the PDFX
formats, instead of the generic PDF, for final file output. For specifics on
the criteria of each of the PDFX formats, check the Acrobat Help file.
 Standard: Accept the default associated with your chosen preset or
choose a flavor of PDFX from the pop-up menu. Remember you only need
to consider this option if you are preparing a PDF for high-resolution
printing and handing the file to a service bureau or offset printer. Again,
for more details about the criteria of each PDFX, see Acrobat Help.
 Compatibility: Specify the version of Acrobat you want your file to
be compatible with. If you are not sure if your recipient has the latest
version of Acrobat, then play it safe and choose a lower version. Note,
however, that Acrobat 4 and 5 do not support layers. When you change
either the Standard or Compatibility options, (Modified) is added to
your preset name.

In addition to the options along the top described in the preceding list, this
massive, multi-tiered dialog box offers the following categories where you
can refine your choices if you want:
 General: The General category of settings contains the PDF presets,
editing options, Acrobat version compatibility choices, and viewing
options. Here’s the rundown:
• Preserve Photoshop Editing Capabilities: This option enables you
to reopen and edit the PDF in Photoshop. All Photoshop data is
saved within the PDF file. This flexibility comes with a price.
Checking this option makes your file size larger.
• Embed Page Thumbnails: Creates a thumbnail of the image that is
then displayed in the Photoshop Open and Place dialog boxes.
• Optimize for Fast Web Preview: Optimizes the file for faster viewing
in your browser.
• View PDF After Saving: After saving, the PDF opens in Acrobat or
Acrobat Reader.
 Compression: The PDF format, by nature, includes excellent compres-
sion, but you can compress and downsample your image even further
to reduce (or maybe to simply adjust) the size of the PDF file. You can
find details about downsampling in Book II, Chapter 1. 
If optimum print quality is a concern, you’re better off not downsam-
pling your image at all.
 Output: The Output area covers how to handle the color data in your file
when you export to PDF. I recommend keeping the default settings of
your presets, unless you are really sure of what you’re doing. An under-
standing of color management, explained in Book II, Chapter 3, helps
you interpret the options in this area.
 Security: If want to apply some restrictions on who can open your
PDF and what they can then do with it, you’ve come to the right spot.
You can assign a password for opening the file in either Acrobat or
Photoshop, but if you forget the password, there is no way to extract it
from your file. Make sure you write it down somewhere! You can also
choose whether you want your user to be able to print or change the
document. 
 Summary: This option gives you a total rundown of all your specified
options and alerts you to anything it finds not-so-kosher.
Note that Acrobat 4 users cannot open PDFs with 128-bit RC4 encryption
(Acrobat 5, 6, 7 and 8).

You can also combine multiple images into a single, multipaged PDF docu-
ment or slide show. This is a great way to e-mail images to co-workers,
family, and friends. Choose File➪Automate➪PDF Presentation. For more
details, see Book IX, Chapter 2.
Photoshop
Of course, I can’t forget the native Photoshop format (.psd). This format
offers a lot of benefits. First of all, along with TIFF and PDF, Photoshop
enables you to save layers in your image. The other formats flatten the
layers into a single background. This format works well if you are going to
spend a considerable length of time working on your image. The Photoshop
format also supports all image modes, is the fastest format for opening and
saving, and offers all the various save options.
Like TIFF, the Photoshop format uses a lossless compression process,
although it’s invisible to you. If you need to open a file in an older version
of Photoshop, be sure to save it as a native Photoshop file. Finally, almost
all drawing and layout programs now support the importing of Photoshop
files.
Note that if you have QuickTime installed on your Macintosh (and to a lesser
extent your PC), it provides a PSD translator that allows you to open PSD
files in any application, such as Microsoft Word, that has the QuickTime
translators enabled.
Photoshop Raw
This format is designed to transfer images among applications and plat-
forms. The Photoshop Raw format can be useful if you want to transfer an
image to or from a mainframe computer or other type of device that doesn’t
support the standard graphic formats. Don’t confuse it with the Camera Raw
format I describe later in this chapter. The Photoshop Raw format supports
CMYK, RGB, and Grayscale images with alpha channels. It also supports
multichannel and Lab Color images without alpha channels. The format
allows for any pixel or file size, but it doesn’t support layers. 
You may never have to save a file in the Photoshop Raw format. And you
may not want to after you read the options involved in saving in this format.
The Photoshop Raw format imports and exports files in an uncompressed,
binary format. The format does not specify image size, color mode, or bit
depth — it’s simply made up of bytes that represent the color information in
the image. Each pixel is represented by a brightness value, with 0 being
black and 255 being white. The format then includes the total number of
Book II
Chapter 2
Choosing Color
Modes and File
Formats

Choosing the Right File Format
158
color channels in the image, plus any other channels, such as alpha chan-
nels. In order to save a file in the Photoshop Raw format you must specify
certain settings in the Photoshop Raw Options dialog box:
 File Type (Mac OS only): This four-character ID identifies the file type.
PRAW is the default ID for the Photoshop Raw format. Leave this default
setting. 
 File Creator (Mac OS only): Another four-character ID that tells the
operating system which application created the file. Leave the default
setting of 8BIM (Photoshop’s code), unless you know the special file
creator ID for the application you plan on using the file with. Many Mac
applications have file creator IDs registered with the Apple Computer
Developer Services group.
 Header: This parameter specifies how many bytes of information
appear in the file before the image data starts. The default setting of 0
means there is no header. If, for example, you enter 2, two zeros are
entered at the beginning of the file as placeholders. When you open the
Photoshop Raw format, you can then replace those placeholders with a
header. I recommend leaving the value at 0.
 Save Channels In: Choose between Interleaved Order and Non-
interleaved Order. The default setting of Interleaved Order stores the
color data sequentially by pixels. In other words, in an RGB image,
the first byte is red for the first pixel, the second byte is green for the
second pixel, the third byte is blue for the third pixel. Non-interleaved
Order stores the color data by channel. In this case, the first byte is
red for the first pixel; the second byte is also red for the second pixel.
When the Red channel is complete, next saved is the Green channel, 
followed by the Blue channel.
Your choice depends on the requirements of the application that opens
the file. 
Camera Raw
The Camera Raw file format is the format used by many digital cameras to
capture and save image data and also the image’s metadata. In fact, this
format captures everything about an image. Each camera has its own 
proprietary raw image format. Fortunately, Photoshop can support
most camera models, especially higher-end cameras. If, by chance, your
new camera isn’t yet supported, check www.adobe.com periodically for
updates.

Choosing the Right File Format
159
Camera Raw files utilize a lossless scheme to capture and save image data,
similar to TIFFs. This is advantageous, because no data is lost through 
compression as it is with the JPEG format. Camera Raw files also have the
advantage of being smaller than uncompressed TIFFs. Of all the digital
camera file formats, only Camera Raw images contain the actual, unadulter-
ated data captured by the digital camera’s sensor without any camera
adjustments, filters, and other processing. Many hard-core photographers
consider this file format to be the pure digital “negative,” so to speak.
They prefer to analyze, manipulate, and adjust the image data themselves
rather than leaving those decisions to the mercy of the camera. This file
format also prevents the loss of any image data that can sometimes occur
when a file is converted from its native format to a more commonly used
format such as TIFF or PSD. But note that Camera Raw is able to save your
files as DNG (Digital Negative), TIFF, PSD, or JPEG formats if you desire.
In this version of Photoshop, Adobe has added further enhancements to
Camera Raw with the introduction of Camera Raw 4.0, shown in Figure 2-14.

Here is just a brief sampling of some of the capabilities of Camera Raw:
 Select multiple Camera Raw files, as well as now also JPEGs and TIFFs,
in the Bridge and edit the settings in one fell swoop. 
 Make Camera Raw adjustments in white balance, exposure, shadows,
contrast, saturation, sharpness, and so on. Your settings are applied to
all selected files.
 Save your Camera Raw files in Bridge or import them into Photoshop
for further enhancements.
 Rate your files inside Camera Raw.
 Crop your Camera Raw images.
 The new Fill Light feature is similar to the Shadow function in Photoshop’s
Shadow/Highlight feature. Move the slider (0 to 100) to lighten dark
areas while leaving light areas undisturbed.
 Camera Raw files are processed in their own thread, which means
you can do double duty — editing some files while saving others 
simultaneously.
Adobe has added additional camera support in version CS3, but if, by chance,
the Camera Raw feature still doesn’t support your particular camera model,
contact Adobe to see if it will be supporting your model in the near future.
If your camera doesn’t capture images in the Camera Raw format at all,
don’t worry. You’re fine with TIFF or JPEG, especially now that you can
even edit these two formats in the Camera Raw dialog box. However, if
your camera is capable of saving images in Camera Raw format, you want to
check out its capabilities. Visit www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/
cameraraw.html for a downloadable User Guide, a Q&A file, and great
tutorials showing all you need to know about working with Camera Raw.
PICT
PICT, for Macintosh Picture, is a format developed by Apple as its main
format for Mac graphics. It is based on the QuickDraw screen language.
And although many Mac programs support PICT, I don’t recommend using it
for any images that you plan to print. PICTs are notorious for being absurdly
slow in the printing department. Today, PICT images are used primarily for
graphics that are incorporated into slides, screen presentations (such as
PowerPoint), multimedia projects, and digital video. PICT supports RGB
(with a single alpha channel), Indexed Color, Grayscale, and Bitmap 
(without alpha channels) image modes.

Choosing the Right File Format
161
Make sure that QuickTime is running if you want to save a file as a PICT.
In the PICT File Options dialog box, you have options for resolution and
compression. Resolution uses the default option; otherwise, you delete
colors from your image and can’t access the compression settings. The com-
pression settings for PICT are more limited than those for the regular JPEG
format — and they cause even more image degradation than those used
with JPEGs. To minimize the damage, always select the maximum quality
setting.
BMP
BMP is a standard Windows file format commonly used for saving images
that you want to make part of your computer’s resources, such as the wall-
paper that you see on your Windows desktop. BMP is also a format used by
computer programmers. BMP supports RGB, Indexed Color, Grayscale, and
Bitmap image modes.
Here are your options when saving a BMP file:
 File Format: Choose between Windows and OS/2.
 Depth: Although you can select a bit depth, I recommend leaving the
default setting Photoshop has selected for you.
 Compress (RLE): The compression scheme used is lossless, which is
great, but don’t select this option if you are creating wallpaper. Windows
won’t recognize it.
 Flip Row Order: This option enables Windows to recognize the file by
reading the first row of pixels first and the last row last. It is for pro-
grammers who are coding for Windows applications. Leave it deselected
unless you’re one of them.
Don’t worry about the Advanced Modes option. It is even more eggheady
than the other options and strictly programming territory.
Large Document Format (PSB)
Work with humongous files? Then you’ll be pleased to know that the Large
Document Format supports files of any size. Besides the Photoshop Raw
and TIFF file formats, the Large Document Format is the only other format
that can save files larger than 2 GB. What’s even better is that the coveted
features, such as layers, layer effects, and filters, are all supported by this
format. If you want to work with large files, just make sure you have the
Maximize PSD and PSB File Compatibility option set to Always in the File
Handling panel of your Preferences.

You knew it was too good to be true, right? Just remember that Large
Document Format files can be opened in Photoshop CS or later, only.
So make sure any recipients of your files have the latest and greatest ver-
sion of Photoshop. This limitation isn’t confined to older versions of
Photoshop either. Be forewarned that many other applications, and even
some operating systems, fall to their knees when presented with a file size
larger than 2 GB.

olor in Photoshop takes on two personalities. On one hand, choosing
colors and applying them is easy, fun, and stress free. On the other
hand, managing color — that is, making what you see on-screen match
what comes out on paper (or in your browser) — can be diffi-
cult and frustrating.
Unfortunately, you have to be well-versed in both 
picking great colors and managing colors for print.
(What’s the use of creating the next Mona Lisa
in Photoshop only to find it looks like a fifth-
generation, color, Xerox copy?) In this chapter,
I start by showing you how to define and apply
color; then I ease you into the world of color 
management.
If you haven’t already read the section on color theory
in Book II, Chapter 2, you might want to give it a gander
before you dive into this chapter. Knowing a little color
theory may make this chapter a little more, er, palette-able.
Dealing with Foreground and Background Colors
Photoshop has two categories of color — a foreground color and a background
color. You apply the foreground color when you use the type tools, the paint-
ing tools, or the shape tools. The foreground color is also the beginning
color of a default gradient applied by the Gradient tool. The background
color is the color you apply with the Eraser tool (assuming you don’t have
layers) and is the ending color of the default gradient. When you increase
the size of your canvas, you fill the additional canvas with the background

Defining Color
164
color (also assuming you don’t have layers). You find the swatches that rep-
resent the two color categories in the lower part of the Tools palette, as
shown in Figure 3-1.
The default color for the foreground is black; the background is white. Click
the small icon labeled in Figure 3-1 to return the colors to the defaults or
simply press the D key. That’s easy to remember. To switch the foreground and
background colors, click the curved arrow in the Toolbox or press the X key.
Here are a few tips to help you get a handle on using tools with foreground
and background colors:
 Blend the foreground and background
with the Gradient tool. When you drag
with the Gradient tool across the canvas
and the gradient is set to the default, you
get a blending of the foreground and back-
ground colors.
 Fill selected areas with the foreground
color. Just click your canvas with the Paint
Bucket tool to select areas based on a
Tolerance setting and fill those areas with
the foreground color.
 Apply the background color by erasing.
If you are working on a background rather
than a layer, you can use the Eraser tool to
apply the background color. Some people
prefer to say you are erasing to the back-
ground or canvas color.
If you use the Eraser tool on a layer, you
erase to transparency. See Book V for the scoop on layers.
 Add more background to your canvas and fill it with the background
color. When you enlarge your canvas size, Photoshop, by default, auto-
matically fills the added canvas with the background color. 
If you enlarge a layer, the extra canvas is transparent. See Book II,
Chapter 1 if the word canvas seems foreign to you.
Defining Color
As with nearly everything else in Photoshop, you can choose color in 
several ways. I explain each of the following color-definition options in
upcoming sections:

 Click a color in the Color Picker.
 Move the sliders in the Color palette.
 Sample color from your image (or elsewhere) with the Eyedropper tool.
 Grab a color from the Swatches palette.
Poking around Color Picker
When you click either the Foreground or Background color swatch in the
Tools palette, you’re transported magically to the Color Picker. This huge
dialog box, shown in Figure 3-2, allows you to select a color from the color
spectrum (called a color slider) or to define your color numerically.
Figure 3-2: Using the Color Picker is one of the many ways 
to specify color in Photoshop.
Choosing a color visually is fine for Web or multimedia work, but not recom-
mended for print work. Among other reasons, your monitor uses an RGB
(red, green, blue) color model, whereas printers use a CMYK (cyan, magenta,
yellow, and black) model. For more on this and other color-management
issues, see “Color Management Essentials,” later in this chapter. For the
basics of color theory, see Book II, Chapter 2.

1. Click either the Foreground or Background color swatch in the Tools
palette.
The Color Picker dialog box appears (refer to Figure 3-2).
2. Drag the color slider to get in the ballpark for the color you want.
3. To fine-tune your choice, click in the large square on the left.
This square area is called a color field. The circular icon targets your
selected shade. The dialog box displays your new chosen color as well
as the current, or original, foreground or background color.
The numeric values also change accordingly to represent the exact
shade you’ve chosen.
Alternatively, if you know the numeric values of the color you want to
use, you can plug in the values in the text boxes on the right side of the
Color Picker. For example, RGB values are based on brightness levels,
from 0 to 255, with 0 being black and 255 being the pure color or white.
CMYK values are based on percentages (0–100) of the four process
colors — cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. You can enter the hexadeci-
mal formula for Web Safe colors.
4. When you’re satisfied with the color, you can now add your new
color to your Swatches palette. Click the Add to Swatches button.
Name your new swatch and click OK.
5. Click OK to exit the Color Picker.
You can do pretty much the same thing in the Color palette that you can
do with the Color Picker. I prefer the Color palette, so I go into more detail
about that approach in the next section.
Mixing with the Color palette
To open the Color palette, shown in
Figure 3-3, choose Window➪Color.
A couple of swatches in this palette may
look vaguely familiar. That’s because
they represent the foreground and
background colors — just like the
swatches in the Tools palette. And
(also like the Tools palette swatches)
the infamous Color Picker appears if
you click the swatches in the Color
palette. But forget the Color Picker; you
don’t need to go there. Everything you
need is right here in this tiny palette.
Before you use the Color palette to define your colors, you should know
which color model you want to use. Here is a short description of each:
Figure 3-3: The Color palette is a compact,
but efficient way to choose colors.

Defining Color
167
 Grayscale is the color model for working strictly in black and white and
shades of gray. You’ll get one slider, K, which represents black. Move the
slider to get shades of gray, including complete white and black.
 RGB (Red-Green-Blue) is the model for anything that’s viewed 
on-screen — from multimedia and slide presentations to content for
the Web. Occasionally, you can use it for printing with desktop inkjet
printers.
 CMYK (Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black) is the color model used in printing.
 Web Color is the model used strictly for the Web. If you choose this
model, make sure that you also choose Make Ramp Web Safe from the
Color palette options menu.
 HSB (Hue-Saturation-Brightness), which I don’t cover in Book II,
Chapter 2, is based on percentages of saturation and brightness and
an angle (0 to 360 degrees), which corresponds to a location on the
color wheel.
 Lab (Lightness, a, b) is a color model that contains three channels: one
for lightness, one (a) that contains colors from green to red, and one (b)
that contains colors from blue to red. Lab is more complex to understand
and work with than the other models — and it’s the color model of
choice for high-end color experts. (By the way, Lab is also Photoshop’s
“native” color mode.)
When defining a color according to a color model, I think the Color palette is
the way to go. Here are the quick and easy steps to define a color by using
the Color palette:
1. Open the Color palette by choosing Window➪Color. 
2. Make sure the color swatch you want to define, Foreground or
Background, is selected on the left side of the Color palette. 
An outline appears around the selected swatch.
3. Select your desired color model from the Color palette pop-up menu
by clicking the arrow in the upper-right corner.
You’ll probably be using RGB, CMYK, or Web Color the majority of
the time. 
If you want to use the RGB color model but also want to ensure that any
color you choose is printable, select CMYK Spectrum from the Color
palette options menu. By default, all the colors in the ramp are print-
able. Just be sure to choose your colors by clicking in the ramp.
4. In the Color palette, move the sliders for each component of the color
model or enter a numeric value.
You can also select a color by clicking inside the color ramp at the
bottom of the Color palette. Click the small swatches at the far right end
of the color ramp to change your color to black or white.

5. To make sure your desired color works with the color mode you’ve
selected, keep an eye open for an alert icon.
• If you’re working in RGB or CMYK, this alert icon is known as the
gamut alarm and looks like the triangular warning shown in Figure 3-3.
Its appearance is Photoshop’s way of saying, “Hey, you! That color
you mixed won’t print the way you think it will because it’s out of
gamut.” Remember gamut is the range of colors a device can either
display or print.
• Because the RGB color model has a much wider gamut than the CMYK
color model, some of the colors can only be viewed on-screen and
not reproduced on paper.
• If a color is out of gamut, Photoshop offers you a substitution. Inside a
little square to the right of the gamut alarm icon, the closest printable
color to the one you chose appears.
• If you’re working in Web Colors, be on the lookout for a small cube
icon. Click either the icon or the square to use the closest Web-safe
color. The cube indicates that the color you mixed is not a Web-safe
color. Clicking the cube tells Photoshop that you want to use its Web-
safe alternative instead. A Web-safe color ensures that the color
will not dither (mixing available colors to simulate a missing color)
when displayed in the browser. 
6. Click either the icon or the square if you want to use the closest print-
able color rather than your original choice.
Grabbing color from the Swatches palette
Another way to define a foreground or
background color is by clicking a color
in the Swatches palette, shown in
Figure 3-4. Choose Window➪Swatches
to bring up the palette.
You can have any tool active when you
use the Swatches palette to define a
color because as soon as you move the
tool over the Swatches palette, it tem-
porarily changes to an Eyedropper icon
that samples the color. 
Besides being a way to select your fore-
ground and background colors, the
Swatches palette acts like a traditional
artist’s paint palette in digital form by
letting you store as many colors as you want in the palette for later use.
Figure 3-4: The Swatches palette allows
you to grab and store colors.

Defining Color
169
To change the background color, either select the background swatch icon
in the Color palette or simply Ctrl+click a swatch in the Swatches palette.
(Ô+click on the Mac).
Here are some of the things you can do with the Swatches palette:
 Customize the Swatches palette’s display. You can choose how to 
display the Swatches palette by choosing Small or Large Thumbnail
(swatch thumbnails) or Small or Large List (swatch thumbnails along
with a name) from the Swatches palette pop-up menu (click the right-
pointing triangle in the upper right to open the menu).
 Use preset colors. To load a particular preset swatch library, choose
it from the list on the Swatches palette pop-up menu. Click Append to
add the library to the existing swatches or OK to replace the existing
swatches. You find libraries specific for Web graphics and for imple-
menting spot colors such as those created by Pantone, Toyo, and
Focoltone. You can also select Load Swatches from the Swatches palette
pop-up menu. In the Load dialog box, navigate to the Color Swatches
folder by following this path: Adobe Photoshop➪Presets➪Color
Swatches; and select your desired library.
You can also work with swatches by using the Preset Manager.
(For more on the Preset Manager, see Book I, Chapter 5.)
 Customize your own Swatches palette. To add a color to the Swatches
palette, do one of the following:
• Click the New Swatch icon at the bottom of the Swatches palette.
• Choose New Swatch from the Swatches palette pop-up menu.
Name your swatch and click OK.
• Click an empty spot in the Swatches palette (your cursor changes to
a paint bucket icon). Name your swatch and click OK. Or Alt+click
(Option+click on the Mac) on an empty spot to add the color and
bypass the Name dialog box.
 Delete swatches that you don’t want anymore. To delete a swatch,
drag it to the trash can icon at the bottom of the Swatches palette.
 Create your own library of swatches. To save a set of swatches as a
library, choose Save Swatches from the Swatches palette pop-up menu.
Navigate to the folder where you want to save the library.
 Save swatches to share with other Adobe Creative Suite applications.
Choose Save Swatches for Exchange from the Swatches palette pop-up
menu, and your color palette is saved in a format (with an .ase exten-
sion) that you can then load into sister applications such as Illustrator
and InDesign.

I recommend saving libraries in a subfolder of the Presets folder. Follow
this path: Adobe Photoshop➪Presets➪Color Swatches; then create
your own folder, name the file, and click Save.
 Restore your default swatch libraries. To return to the default library
of swatches, choose Reset Swatches from the Swatches palette pop-up
menu. You can choose to either replace or append to the current library.
Lifting and sampling color 
Photoshop lets you change foreground or background colors by lifting them
from the image with the Eyedropper tool. Using the Eyedropper tool comes
in handy when you want to sample an existing color in an image for use in
another element. For example, if I want my text to be the same color as the
flower in my image, I click a petal with my Eyedropper tool, which then lifts
(samples) the color and makes it my new foreground color. I then create my
type, which uses that foreground color. Voilà — color coordination at its finest.
Here are some handy tips for using the Eyedropper tool to suck up color
from one place and use it elsewhere in your image:
 Choose any color you want from any image that’s open. If you have
multiple images open, you can also click inside an image that you’re not
working on. In fact, if that doesn’t knock your socks off, you can lift any
color you see on-screen, even from a file in another application, such as
Illustrator, or from your desktop. Just drag your Eyedropper from the
image window onto the color you want to sample.
 Choose your sampling area. You have only one option (found on the
Options bar) to worry about when using the Eyedropper tool. You have
the option of selecting the color of just the single pixel you click (Point
Sample). Or Photoshop averages the colors of the pixels in a 3×3, 5×5,
11×11, 31×31, 51×51 and 101×101-pixel radius.
 Make colors Web ready with a right-click of your mouse button.
For you Webbies out there, if you right-click (Control+click on the Mac)
your image to bring up the context menu, you have one more option —
Copy Color as HTML. This option converts the sampled color to a 
hexadecimal color code and copies the code to the Clipboard so that
you can paste the code into an HTML file.
 Toggle between the Eyedropper and other tools. For your productive
painting pleasure, when you’re using the Brush, Pencil, Color
Replacement, Gradient, Paint Bucket, or Shape tool, pressing Alt
(Option on the Mac) allows you to temporarily access the Eyedropper
tool. Release the key and return to your original tool.

Defining Color
171
 Toggle between the background and the foreground. If the foreground
color swatch is active, press Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) with
the Eyedropper tool to lift a new background color. If the background
color swatch is active, pressing Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) lifts
a new foreground color.
To use the Eyedropper tool, you first need to decide whether you want to
change the foreground or background color. Then follow these steps:
1. Select the foreground (or the background) in the Tools palette or the
Color palette.
2. Select the Eyedropper tool in the Tools palette (or press the I key).
Fortunately, the Eyedropper looks exactly like a real eyedropper.
3. Click the color in your image that you want to use.
That color becomes your new foreground (or background) color.
Using the Color Sampler tool to measure color
The Eyedropper’s cousin, the Color Sampler tool, looks like an eyedrop-
per with a small target next to the icon. It also shares the Eyedropper’s
flyout menu.
The “Sampler” moniker is kind of misleading because this tool only measures
the colors you click. Aside from merely obtaining the numeric value of a
color, another use of the Color Sampler tool is to monitor changes to your
image after you apply color-correction techniques and filters.
Follow these steps to use the Color Sampler tool:
1. Select the Color Sampler tool in the Tools palette and then click the
color you want to measure.
Note the target icon that appears on your image. It is labeled as #1.
Photoshop opens the Info palette automatically, and shows you the
numeric values for that color (as shown in Figure 3-5).
2. Repeat Step 1 up to three more times for a total of four targeted colors.
Target icons appear for your second, third, and fourth samples.
3. With the Color Sampler tool, drag the targets to sample new areas
of your image if you want. Delete a target by Alt+clicking (Option+
clicking) it.

Grab some Tylenol. You’re about to delve into the rather confusing and some-
times cantankerous world (or as some users would call it — underworld) of
color management. It is, by far, the biggest headache of every graphics pro-
fessional’s day-to-day experience. And I’m sure quite a few home users also
scratch their heads wondering why their digital photo looked so great on-
screen and turned into a muddy mess on paper.
Reproducing color is not an exact science. In fact, sometimes you would
think it takes an act of voodoo magic to get the output you want. Don’t throw
up your hands and live with whatever output comes out the other end; if
you can’t change the color, you can at least change your attitude toward
color. Getting a handle on color management requires four things — some
knowledge, some patience, a significant amount of time to experiment and

test, and  — most importantly — acceptance. Acceptance of the unfortunate
fact that we don’t live in a WYSIWYG world: What you get in one medium is
sometimes merely an approximation of what you see in another.
Why? Well, I start with the basic gripe of many users as they look dis-
approvingly at their printout — “But it didn’t look like that on the screen!”
As detailed in Book II, Chapter 2, there are two major color models — RGB
(Red-Green-Blue) and CMYK (Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black). The RGB color
model (16.7 million colors), which all monitors use, has a significantly wider
range of color (called a gamut in computer lingo) than the CMYK color model
(approximately 55,000 colors) that is used by printers. The result is that
many of the colors you see on-screen fall outside the CMYK gamut — and
therefore cannot be reproduced on paper. And in some cases, some CMYK
colors fall outside the RGB gamut. Programs such as Photoshop try to do
their best by providing colors that are the closest match. But those bright
and vibrant colors that are out of gamut are matched with duller, darker 
versions at best.
And if that difference alone isn’t enough to complicate matters, hardware
devices that share the same color model can possess different gamuts
within the same color model. For example, the RGB color space of a monitor
can differ from the RGB color space of a scanner. Not only that, but you can
also have different color spaces within the same type of device. A 15-inch
generic monitor won’t display color equal to a 21-inch Sony Trinitron monitor.
Likewise, an Epson printer may not share the same color space as a Hewlett-
Packard or Canon printer. So when you take into account the differences
that can occur between platforms, monitors, printers, browsers, scanners,
applications, paper and other substrates, or any of the almost infinite
number of possible permutations, it makes you want to return to the days of
quill and parchment. Techies often call this mind-numbingly large number of
possible inconsistencies device-dependent color. In other words, the color is
dependent upon the hardware device. And device-dependent color varies.
That’s just the cold, harsh reality, and nothing’s changing that.
But Adobe, being the kind and benevolent software megagiant that it is, has
developed (first introduced in Version 5.0) a color-management system
designed to be device-independent. The five-cent explanation of this system
is that you first identify your working color spaces. Photoshop then tags
your files with that color space by embedding a color profile (also known as
an ICC profile) with your files. The program then analyzes any color space in
which you either view or output a file and makes adjustments on the fly so
that the color is viewed and printed reasonably accurately and consistently,
in theory, independent of the device. Photoshop also reads the embedded
color profile (or lack thereof) of any file you open and addresses how you
wish to deal with that profile if it doesn’t match your working color space.

In the upcoming sections, I give you the 25-cent explanation — which I hope
is enough to get you started in managing color. If color management is an
extremely critical workflow issue to you, I recommend buying a book or two
strictly devoted to nothing but managing color. It is well worth the money.
Setting up your work environment
One aspect of color management that people often overlook is setting up a
good working environment for digital image editing. You may wave your
hand impatiently and say, “Yeah, yeah, I just want to get to the important
stuff.” This is the important stuff.
Don’t worry. Setting up a good work environment won’t cost you much.
Just do these things:
 Keep your computer desktop a neutral gray. Colors and patterns
behind your images influence the way that you perceive those images.
Creating a neutral, gray desktop is the closest you can get to mounting
your work on gray, black, or white matte board (and not neon green or
paisley) the way professional graphic designers and photographers do.
 Keep your lighting as consistent as possible. For example, avoid work-
ing on images in full, bright afternoon sun and then again under a single
desk lamp late at night. Likewise, view on-screen images and your
printed output under the same lighting.
 Keep the walls of your work environment as neutral as your monitor
desktop. You don’t have to paint your office gray, but try to avoid lots
of colorful posters and artwork around and behind your monitor.
 Speaking of monitors, if you are using an LCD (flat screen) monitor, be
sure you are sitting directly in front of it. Color shifts quite a bit on LCDs
if you are viewing it at even a slight angle. So no slumping in your chair! 
 Keep a swatch book (or two) handy, such as those from Pantone or
Trumatch, to choose your colors. Don’t make a decision based on what
you see on-screen. These books give you a true representation of how on-
screen color looks when printed on paper. Just make sure and keep them
out the light and update them periodically when the colors start to fade.
Be prepared for a healthy monetary investment when you buy a swatch
book. These little buggers can cost anywhere from $75 to $200. You can
purchase swatch books from some larger art supply stores or order
them online. You can purchase Pantone books from
www.pantone.com. Do a search for others such as Trumatch,
Focoltone, and Toyo.
 Take some time to test your workflow (production methods) and
your computer system. Scan images using multiple settings, print
images using multiple settings, and view your images using different
browsers on different monitors and different platforms.

Get to know the strengths and limitations and quirks of every piece of your
equipment. Experiment with Photoshop. I know, I know, you have a life. But
trust me — it’s an investment with great returns.
Calibrating your monitor
Calibrating your monitor and creating an ICC profile of your monitor ensures
that your monitor doesn’t display any red, green, or blue colorcasts (a trace
of color) and that it provides as neutral a gray screen as possible. Calibration
is incredibly important if you want to standardize your image display —
knowing that how you view your image today will be how you view your
image tomorrow or next week.
If you really want to do a great calibration job, consider investing in a combina-
tion hardware/software calibration package. These products used to be really
pricey, but you can get a starter package for as little as $79. You can choose
from several manufacturers, including ColorVision (www.colorvision.com)
and gretagmacbeth (www.gretagmacbeth.com).
If more software isn’t within your budget, you can use the rudimentary cali-
bration tool that comes with Photoshop (Windows) or your system software
(Mac). Turn on your monitor and let it warm up at least an hour. Then, open
the utility to begin calibrating your monitor.
If you’re a Windows user, you can use Photoshop’s Adobe Gamma utility...if
Adobe decides to ship it with Photoshop CS3. At press time of this book,
Adobe was waffling on whether to dump Adobe Gamma for good, due to
incompatibilities with Windows Vista. And unless Adobe further tweaks the
utility to work with LCD monitor, its usefulness is somewhat limited anyhow.
If it is included, and you want to use it, look for it in the Control Panel on the
Windows Start/Settings menu. If for some reason you don’t locate it in the
Control Panels, you can find it by going to Program Files\Common Files\
Adobe\Calibration and then double-clicking the Gamma file. You can
either use the Gamma utility’s wizard (shown in Figure 3-6) — which walks
you through the calibration process by asking you a series of questions —
or manually calibrate your monitor by using sliders in the Adobe Gamma
control panel.
If you’re a Mac OS X user, you can use the Display Calibrator Assistant.

Both utilities, Adobe Gamma and the Display Calibrator Assistant, attempt
to remove any colorcasts and get as neutral a gray background as you can.
They also create a profile of your monitor for Photoshop, Illustrator, and
other programs so those applications know how your monitor displays color.

Figure 3-6: The Adobe Gamma utility helps Windows users 
quickly calibrate their monitors.
When you calibrate your monitor, display an image for which you already
know the color values. For example, use an image that you’ve worked with
and for which you have a good print and then use that image each and
every time you calibrate. Your goal is to match the digital image on your
screen to the printed image. You should calibrate every so often because
monitors can drift and degrade. Some experts say weekly is best; others are
more liberal and say monthly is fine.

Not only is letting your monitor warm up a prerequisite before you calibrate,
it is also a good idea before you sit down to tackle any image adjustment work.
Establishing Your Settings
After you have calibrated your monitor (see the preceding section) and ade-
quately arranged your work environment, you need to nail down the color
settings and make sure they’re the right match for your intended output. 
You establish these settings in the Color Settings dialog box, the rather
intimidating dialog box shown in Figure 3-8. To open it, choose Edit➪Color
Settings. In the Color Settings dialog box, you can choose from predefined
settings established for specific types of output, or you can customize your
own settings to fit your individual needs. The following sections offer more
details about the settings you can choose in the Color Settings dialog box.
As you’re perusing the dialog box, hover your cursor over any item, and a
great description of that item appears at the bottom of the dialog box.

Handling Photoshop’s predefined settings
In the Color Settings dialog box, Photoshop allows you to take the easy
route and choose from a long list of predefined color settings based on your
desired output. After you set up the predefined settings, Photoshop provides
all the appropriate working color spaces and color-management policies
you need to get good color results. 
Being the smart program that it is, Photoshop won’t steer you down the
wrong path with its predefined settings. The only way you can mess up the
predefined settings is if your output doesn’t match the setting. For example,
the Web Graphics Defaults setting isn’t appropriate for your high-end, four-
color print job, because these two mediums use color in completely different
ways (see Book II, Chapter 2 for details if you’re curious why this is so). 
Be sure and click the More Options button in the Color Settings dialog box
to access the full set of predefined color settings. Here is a brief description
of each setting in the Settings drop-down list at the top:
 Custom: Allows you to manually assign your own settings. When you
define a custom configuration, save your settings so that you can reload
them later if necessary.
 Monitor Color: Emulates the color of most video applications. Reserve
it for screen images only. Avoid it for producing print images.
 North America General Purpose 2: Provides all-purpose general color set-
tings for screen and print images in North America. Uses the same CMYK,
Grayscale, and Spot working spaces as the North America Prepress 2,
but uses the Web standard of the sRGB for the RGB working space.
 North America Prepress 2: Provides color settings for print images in
North America. Preserves the CMYK working space and brings any pro-
file warnings to your attention.
 North America Web/Internet: Gives color settings for Web images in
North America. Uses sRGB for the RGB working space.
 Color Management Off: Deactivates Photoshop’s color-management
system. I recommend this setting for video output only, but not for any-
thing else, unless you’re a color guru and know what you’re doing.
 ColorSync Workflow (Mac only): Uses ColorSync 3.0 Color
Management System and ColorSync profiles. It’s not recognized by the
Windows platform.
 Emulate Acrobat 4: Emulates Acrobat 4 and earlier versions.
 Emulate Photoshop 4: Turns off color management and emulates the
Photoshop 4 display. Photoshop 4 didn’t employ color management.

 Photoshop 5 Default Spaces: Uses the default color settings found in
Photoshop 5, the first version to use color management.
 U.S. Prepress Defaults: Provides the settings for printing in the United
States. This is a good overall selection if you use Photoshop mainly for
print work.
 Web Graphics Defaults: Provides the settings for Web graphics. If you
use Photoshop primarily for Web content, this setting is a good option
because it reflects the average PC monitor.
Note that you can always use a predefined setting as a starting point and
adjust whatever individual settings you need to. Note that if you do, your
predefined setting name automatically changes to Custom.
Indicating your working spaces
If you choose one of the predefined color settings from the Settings drop-
down list, Photoshop plugs in all the necessary remaining options in the
dialog box. (If you select the Custom option, Photoshop leaves whatever
settings were there previously because it knows you are going to choose
your own settings anyway.)
When you chose one of the predefined color settings, the first group of set-
tings that Photoshop plugged in contained your working spaces. Working
spaces are the color profiles associated with the RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, and
Spot color modes. If you choose the Custom color setting, you need to
choose your own working spaces.
Each of the four working spaces is equally important, so I advise you to
read all the following sections — and read them in order — if you’re serious
about color management.

After you set RGB working spaces, don’t forget that you also have to 
configure the other three working spaces, as described in the following 
sections.
CMYK working spaces
CMYK working spaces are a little more involved than RGB options, listed in
the preceding section. They serve a threefold purpose:
Book II
Chapter 3
Using and
Managing Color

Establishing Your Settings
182
 CMYK is the color space to which Photoshop converts your RGB file
when you choose Image➪Mode➪CMYK.
 CMYK is the color space you view your RGB image in when you choose
View➪Proof Setup➪Working CMYK (see the upcoming section on soft
proofing colors).
 The CMYK color space determines how a CMYK file is displayed on an
RGB monitor.
Europe, Japan, and the United States have specific color profiles for printing.
Those CMYK options are divided between those for coated and uncoated
paper, and sheet-fed or Web printing presses. The latter two have different
percentages of ink coverage and paper stock. There is also a ColorSync
Generic CMYK profile for Macs only. I would leave the setting at U.S. Web
Coated (SWOP)v2 unless your commercial printer tells you otherwise.
Grayscale working spaces
Grayscale working spaces have to do with two parameters — viewing and
dot gain of grayscale images (Image➪Mode➪Grayscale). You can choose
Gray Gamma 1.8 for a Macintosh monitor or Gray Gamma 2.2 for a PC moni-
tor. You can also view an image according to how it will print, based on typical
dot gain.
Dot gain is how much ink the paper absorbs, thereby increasing the size of
every halftone dot. When continuous-tone images are digitized, they are
converted into a series of dots known as a halftone.
If you’re preparing graphics for the Web, you may want to set your working
space to Gray Gamma 2.2 — whether or not you’re using a Mac — because
most of the Web surfers worldwide are PC users.
For print work, leave the setting at Dot Gain 20% unless your commercial
printer tells you otherwise. You can enter any desired percentage in the
Custom Dot Gain option.
Don’t forget — you still have to adjust another working space.
Spot working spaces
Spot working spaces have to do with spot colors. Spot colors are premixed
inks that are printed in addition to, or in lieu of, the four process colors —
cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. Unless your commercial printer tells you
otherwise, stick with a setting of Dot Gain 20%.

Establishing Your Settings
183
Working with your newly defined settings
After you define your color profiles in the Color Settings dialog box, it’s 
helpful to get a handle on how these newly established settings affect how
Photoshop works. Although the settings typically affect how Photoshop
works in the background, you nevertheless might want to be aware of the
following key changes:
 By default, any new images you create use the color profile you
selected in the Color Settings dialog box. Every file you create on your
computer now uses the colors within the gamut of your color profiles
(either RGB or CMYK, depending on your document color mode).
Overall, this default setting should make managing color in Photoshop
easier. For example, if you mostly work with multimedia or Web images
and have specified your color settings accordingly, you don’t need to
think about each color displaying accurately, because you’ve set the
defaults to reflect that color mode. But if you want to prep an image for
print, those defaults won’t work, and you need to change your individ-
ual working spaces to those that are print oriented or to a preset, such
as North American Prepress.
 The color settings you choose are applied to any untagged images
(images that don’t have an embedded color). An example of an untagged
image is a Photoshop file created before Version 5 — that is, before
Photoshop supported embedded color profiles.
 Your settings also define how Photoshop converts your images from one
working space to another. For example, say you chose North America
Prepress 2 from the Settings drop-down list in the Color Settings dialog
box. In this case, the default for CMYK is U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2,
which is a specific CMYK setting for a Web printing press and coated
paper, among other things. (You see this setting in the Working Spaces
area of the Color Settings dialog box.) When you convert an RGB image
to CMYK (Image➪Mode➪CMYK) prior to sending it off to the printer,
Photoshop automatically tags the image with the U.S. Web Coated
(SWOP) v2 color profile. 
 When you save a file, make sure that you select the ICC Profile (Embed
Color Profile on the Mac) option in the Save dialog box, if it’s available
(see Figure 3-9). (Some file formats don’t support color profiles.) This
ensures that Photoshop tags the file with the specified color profile and
that its origins are always known.

Managing Color

Figure 3-9: Select the ICC (or Color) Profile check box when you 
save an image.
Setting color-management policies
After you establish working color spaces, the next step is to establish the
default color-management policy for each color mode. In other words, you
need to tell Photoshop how to interpret and manage the color profiles of
files it opens.
Photoshop looks at the color profile of that file, compares it to your working
spaces, and then employs the default policies you have established. If the file
has the same color profile as yours, there isn’t an issue. You’re good to go. 
But sometimes this isn’t the case — as in these situations: 
 The file you open has no profile. These can be older files, files that
were created with color management turned off, or files created in
other applications that do not employ color management.
 The file you open has a color profile that doesn’t match your working
space. Say that you have a Web designer friend, and his settings are
based on the North America Web/Internet option. He gives you a file,
and you open it in Photoshop on your computer. You do mostly print

185
work, so your settings are the
North America Prepress 2 option.
Photoshop then displays an alert
that says the file has an embedded
color profile that doesn’t match
your current RGB working space —
his working space is sRGB and
yours is Adobe RGB (1998). The
alert then goes on to describe the
default policy that is invoked on
the file, as shown in Figure 3-10.
Again, if you have selected a predefined setting, the policies have already
been established for you, and those should work fine. I do recommend, how-
ever, that if you change the policies of any of the predefined settings you
don’t choose Off as your option, unless you have a good reason not to.
(Remember: Color management is a good thing.)
To set your color-management policies, follow these steps:
1. Open the Color Settings dialog box by choosing Edit➪Color Settings.
2. In the Color Management Polices area, choose from the following
three options for each color mode:
• Off: This option turns color management off for any new files you
create, import, or open. However, if the opened or imported file’s
color profile matches your current working space, the profile is 
preserved.
• Preserve Embedded Profiles: This option displays the files in their
original embedded color space. No color conversion occurs. Untagged
files remain untagged but use the current working space for display.
• Convert to Working RGB (or CMYK or Grayscale, depending on
your image mode): This option converts any files with missing or
mismatched embedded profiles to your working RGB space. Untagged
files remain untagged but use the current working space for display.
3. Decide whether you want to check the Ask When Opening check box
for Profile Mismatches.
If you do not select the Ask When Opening option for Profile Mismatches,
Photoshop displays the Embedded Profile Mismatch alert message (see
Figure 3-11), describing which default policy will occur. You can then
select the Don’t Show Again check box, and from that point forward,
Photoshop executes the policy without displaying an alert. For files with
missing profiles, Photoshop simply invokes the default policy without
an alert.
Book II
Chapter 3
Using and
Managing Color
Figure 3-10: Photoshop alerts you when
you open a file whose color profile doesn’t
match yours.

Establishing Your Settings
186
If you select the Ask When Opening
option for Profile Mismatches,
Photoshop not only displays an
Embedded Profile Mismatch alert,
but also provides you with options
for handling the color of that file,
thereby overriding the default
policy, as shown in Figure 3-11.
The options in the alert are similar
to the default policies of the Color
Settings dialog box. Here’s a brief
explanation of each option in the
alert:
• Use the Embedded Profile
(Instead of the Working Space): Photoshop displays the file in its
original embedded color space and does not perform any color 
conversions.
• Convert Document’s Colors to the Working Space: Photoshop 
converts the file from its embedded color space to your working
color space.
• Discard the Embedded Profile (Don’t Color Manage): Photoshop
doesn’t utilize any color management when opening files but dis-
plays the file in your working space.
Be cautious about making any CMYK conversions. If you encounter a
Profile Mismatch with a CMYK image, you probably want to preserve
the image’s embedded profile unless you’re absolutely sure it should be
converted to another CMYK working space. But, if the image doesn’t
have a profile, then by all means convert it to your CMYK working
space.
4. Decide whether you want to check the Ask When Pasting box for
Profile Mismatches.
If you select the Ask When Pasting option for Profile Mismatches,
Photoshop prompts you when you drag and drop layers or selections
that have the same color mode (see Book II, Chapter 2 for more on
modes), but different color profiles. In the Paste Profile Mismatch alert
dialog box, you have two options:
• Convert (Preserve Color Appearance): Photoshop converts and
matches the appearance of the color rather than the RGB numerical
values. For example, the RGB color of R 152, G 122, B 250 may be a
different shade of purple in one RGB working space versus another.
If you preserve the numerical values, the shades won’t match. If you
preserve the appearance, Photoshop attempts to maintain the two
shades.
Figure 3-11: Checking the Ask When
Opening option allows you to override your
default color-management policy setting.

Establishing Your Settings
187
• Don’t Convert (Preserve Color Number): Photoshop does not con-
vert the appearance of the color but instead matches the RGB
numerical values.
If you don’t select the Ask When Pasting check box, Photoshop pastes
the color appearance between RGB images and pastes the numerical
values between CMYK images.
5. Decide whether you want to
select the Ask When Opening
check box for Missing Profiles.
If you do select the check box,
Photoshop displays a Missing
Profile alert and also provides you
with the following options, as
shown in Figure 3-12:
• Leave As Is (Don’t Color
Manage): This leaves the
image untagged and without a
color profile, but displays the image in your working space.
• Assign Working RGB (or CMYK or Grayscale, depending on your
image mode): your working space: Photoshop tags the image with
your working space and displays it in that working space. If you
change your working space, the image retains the old working space.
• Assign Profile: This option allows you to assign any color profile
contained within the pop-up menu. You can use this option if you
know where the untagged image originated. For example, if you
scanned your image and your scanner doesn’t embed profiles, you
can assign the scanner profile.
Unless you have a specific reason not to, I recommend that you assign
your working RGB space to those orphan files.
6. If you’re done working in the Color Settings dialog box, click OK to exit.
I recommend selecting the Ask When Opening and Ask When Pasting check
boxes. That way you know when a profile mismatch occurs — and you have
the choice of picking your course of action, which includes overriding the
defaults you set in the policy settings. This allows you to evaluate whether
you want to preserve or convert on a file-by-file basis. For example, if you’re
a print designer, and a Web designer gives you a file, you get a profile mis-
match alerting you that the file has the sRGB color space and that it doesn’t
match your working space of Adobe RGB (1998). If you’re going to use the
image as-is for Web content, you tell Photoshop to preserve the embedded
profile and not to make any conversion. But if you want to repurpose the
image (for, say, a logo), you have to instruct Photoshop to convert the file to
your working RGB space. (Of course, ultimately, you have to also convert
the image mode to CMYK for printing purposes.)

Getting Consistent Color among Adobe Applications
188
To find out the color profile of an image, choose Document Profile from the
pop-up menu at the bottom of the image window (which I describe in detail
in Book I, Chapter 1). Also if an image has a color profile that differs from
your working space, an asterisk appears in the title bar. An untagged image
displays a pound sign.
By the way, when you select the More Options, you have a few additional
options regarding color conversion engines and rendering intents, which
are methods of color translation. I recommend putting your trust in
Photoshop and leaving these options at their defaults, unless you’re a bona
fide color expert.
Getting Consistent Color among Adobe Applications
If you have a complete Adobe workflow (I do), you’ll want to use the same
Color Settings for all your Adobe applications. Illustrator, InDesign, GoLive,
and Acrobat share a similar Color Settings dialog box. They have a few
minor differences, but nothing major. If an element doesn’t exist in one
application’s Color Settings dialog box, Adobe merely plugs in the default
setting. You can choose the same predefined color setting from the Settings
pop-up menu in each application or you can now use a shortcut. Read on.
With the advent of Adobe Bridge, getting consistent color across all your
Creative Suite applications is merely a button click away. Simply launch
Bridge and choose Edit➪Creative Suite Color Settings. In the Suite Color
Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 3-13, you can immediately tell whether
the color settings across all your CS3 applications are “synchronized.”
(Synchronized is Adobe’s cool name for the same.) If they aren’t and you
want the settings to be the same, first click the Show Expanded List of
Color Settings Files to ensure you have the full list of possibilities. Then just
choose your desired predefined color setting from the list and click the
Apply button. Bridge then ensures that each CS3 application uses that color
setting. You can also choose a previously saved custom setting. Just make sure
you save it to the right place. If you want to see where your saved color 
settings files reside, just click the Show Saved Color Settings Files button.
Note that it isn’t mandatory that you synchronize your color settings. You
may want to have different settings in InDesign, a page-layout program, than
you have in Dreamweaver, a Web-page-creation application. Note that in the
Color Settings dialog box in each CS3 application, a message is displayed at
the top to let you know whether your suite color settings are synchronized.
You can save your custom Color Settings in Photoshop by clicking the Save
button in the Color Settings dialog box. To ensure that all your Adobe appli-
cations can access the settings file, save it to a default location:

Proofing Colors in the Final Output (Soft Proofing)
189
 For Microsoft Windows, the default location is the Program
Files/Common Files/Adobe/Color/Settings folder.
 For Mac OS X users, the default folder is User/CurrentUser/
Library/ApplicationSupport/Adobe/Color/Settings.
Figure 3-13: Getting consistent color among your Adobe Creative 
Suite applications is a matter of a few clicks in Adobe Bridge.
Note that you can also place saved custom Color Settings files that you have
received from other people (for example, reps from your offset print house)
in this location as well. 
Proofing Colors in the Final Output (Soft Proofing)
Photoshop allows you to preview on-screen how your image will look on a
variety of output devices. First, choose View➪Proof Setup and select your
desired setup. The Working options are based on the working spaces you
specified in the Color Settings dialog box.
 Macintosh RGB and Windows RGB display your image as it will appear
on a standard Macintosh or Windows monitor. This setting can come in
handy when you want to get a general idea of how your Web graphic will
look on another platform.

190
 Monitor RGB allows you to view the image by using your current moni-
tor’s color space. This setting essentially turns off your RGB working
space and lets you see the image without any color management.
 Custom allows you to choose a specific device. For example, choosing
U.S. Web Coated (SWOP)v2 lets you to see how your RGB images will
look when they’re converted to CMYK for printing.
After you have chosen your setup, choose View➪Proof Colors to view the
image in your chosen working space. For the most reliable results, use a good
quality monitor and set up a good viewing environment as well. Also keep
in mind that although soft proofing is a good thing, it’s no substitute for a
good-quality hard-copy proof. Some things — such as the type and quality
of paper, certain inks, and so on — cannot be accurately simulated on-
screen. 

Chapter 4: Time Travel — 
Undoing in Photoshop
In This Chapter
 Undoing and redoing
 Exploring the History palette
 Erasing with the Erase to History option
 Brushing back in time with the History Brush tool
W
hen Thomas Wolfe said, “You can’t go home again,” he wasn’t talking
about Photoshop. If you change your mind about something you’ve
done and want to return to your starting place (or any point in between),
Photoshop is very forgiving. My favorite image editor offers many different
ways to reverse actions, undo what you did, reapply effects you’ve
cancelled, and generally change your mind as often as a new
apartment owner deciding where to put the couch.
This chapter helps you master Photoshop’s powerful
time-traveling features, including the Undo command,
the History palette, and tools such as the Art
History Brush and Eraser.
Undoing What’s Done with 
the Undo Command
Your first stop in your journey through time is the
Undo/Redo command. This command simply reverses the
last action you took or reapplies it if you just undid some-
thing. For example, if you apply a brush stroke you don’t like, use
Undo to remove that stroke. Then if you immediately change your mind, you
can redo it.
To undo your last action, choose Edit➪Undo or simply press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on
the Mac).

Reverting to What’s Saved
192
Use Undo/Redo to toggle an effect on and off to compare the before and
after effects quickly by pressing the Undo/Redo shortcut keys rapidly. When
you decide which way to go, stop. This procedure works best if you choose
to press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to apply both Undo and Redo.
Remember that Undo/Redo works only for a single command. If you do any-
thing else after applying a command and then change your mind, you have
to resort to one of the other time-travel techniques described later in this
chapter.
If an action can’t be undone or redone, Undo/Redo is grayed out and unavail-
able. However, you can often use the History palette to remove the action.
See “Working with the Almighty History Palette,” later in this chapter.
If you want to free the memory used by the Undo command, choose Edit➪
Purge➪Undo. If the item is grayed out, the buffer is already empty. Note that
this action cannot be undone, so do it only if Photoshop is acting sluggish.
Reverting to What’s Saved
Revert replaces your current file with the last saved file, effectively wiping out
everything you’ve done since the file was last saved. You can revert to the last
version of the file by choosing File➪Revert (or by pressing F12). Although you
lose all the changes in your current file when the last saved version replaces
it on-screen, the Revert command is stored on the History palette. You find
out how to remove a command from the History palette in the next section.
Working with the Almighty History Palette
Undoing and redoing commands are kid’s stuff next to the power of the
almighty History palette. Think of this tool as a recipe listing all the steps
(depending how many you specified in your preferences) you took to cook
up your image in its present state. Using the History palette, you can
browse through the recipe and return to any step in the list to begin work
anew from that point.
Understanding states and snapshots
You can’t go too far in your use of the History palette without understand-
ing two important concepts, as well as how the concepts are different:
 States: States is just another way of saying steps. At any given point in
your image-editing activities, Photoshop saves your edits into states. 
By default, Photoshop remembers 20 states for an image. You can
increase the number to as many as 1,000 in the Performance Preferences

Working with the Almighty History Palette

dialog box. Choose Edit➪Preferences➪Performance (or Photoshop➪
Preferences➪Performance in Mac OS X) and enter a new value (or move
the slider) in the History States box. 
Keep in mind that boosting this number can eat up your available
memory quite quickly. A better choice may be to leave the states set to
20 and instead save snapshots of your image, as I describe in the follow-
ing sections. Remember that when you reach the limit of 20 steps, the
oldest step (at the top of the list) drops off to make room for the latest
one at the bottom.
 Snapshots: You can save temporary copies of an image, each containing
all its various states. For example, say you make six edits to an image
before you take a snapshot. The snapshot shows the image, but it also
contains a complete history of the six states. Make a few more changes,
and take another snapshot: The new snapshot contains the six states
you made previously, as well as any new ones. See “Taking Snapshots,”
later in this chapter, to find out how to use snapshots.
When you have these concepts down, you can get to the business of under-
standing how the individual tools in the History palette use states and snap-
shots to help you go back in time (and back to the future again) to undo,
redo, and modify each miniscule edit you make to your images.
Introducing History palette options and tools
The History palette has several components you should know about, as
shown in Figure 4-1:
 Snapshot thumbnail: This is a miniature image of the most recently
saved snapshot image, which is a copy of your document with all the
current states included. (For more on snapshots, see “Taking
Snapshots,” later in this chapter.)
 Source state column: Click in this column next to a particular snapshot
or state, and when you begin painting with the History Brush tool or
when erasing with the Erase to History option, Photoshop uses the
snapshot or state you select as the source.
 History state: This is a particular step or edit in your document’s list
of steps. An icon appears in this column showing what kind of action
occurred in that state.
 Active state marker: This slider points to the currently active state.
You can drag it up or down to change the current state.
 Create new document from current state: Click this icon to create a
duplicate copy of your image at the currently selected state. Your new
document starts out with a clean slate and an empty history list.
 Create new snapshot: Click this icon to store an image of your docu-
ment, preserving all the states listed.

Viewing an Image’s Various States
You can move back to any state listed in the History palette, remove a state
to cancel a step, or perform other time-travel stunts with the History palette.
The following sections outline some basic time-shifting techniques you
should know.
Going back to a particular state
To go back in time and resume editing at a particular point, just click the
state you want to return to. All subsequent states appear grayed out, or what
Adobe calls undone. Then begin editing your image as usual. As soon as you
perform a new step, all the states that follow your re-entry point vanish.
It’s like applying the Undo command to a group of steps with one click.
If you intentionally (or accidentally) begin editing while a previous state is
highlighted, and you change your mind, immediately undo your first action —
press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac). The subsequent steps that were removed
reappear.

Looking at the History Options Dialog Box
195
Reviewing your image at different states
To review how your image looked at various previous states, just click the
state you want to take a look at. (You can also drag the active state marker
up and down the list.) The document image immediately changes to reflect
that earlier state. You can move back and forth between any two points in
the history list if you like. As long as you don’t make any editing changes
during your time-traveling jaunt, your current history list is preserved.
Removing and Clearing all states
To remove a state and all the steps that follow it, select the state and then
press the Delete key or click the trash-can icon.
You can clear all the states from the palette by choosing Clear History from
the palette pop-up menu. To delete all the states except the last one in the
history list, as well as keep the snapshots you’ve saved, choose Edit➪Purge➪
Histories. You can clear or purge your history list when you have no further
need of the states it includes — to save memory or to return to the original
state of your document. Just be sure you’re really, seriously, not interested
in going back again later to make changes because this command cannot be
undone, with one exception. You can undo your clearing or purging only if
you choose Edit➪Undo immediately after you execute the command.
Navigating the history list
You can move up and down the history list even if the list isn’t visible on
your screen. The Edit➪Step Forward and Edit➪Step Backward commands
move forward and back in the history list. The best way to access these
commands is to use the keyboard shortcuts:
 Press Alt+Ctrl+Z (Option+Ô+Z on the Mac) to move backward in time
(upward in the history list).
 Press Shift+Ctrl+Z (Shift+Ô+Z on the Mac) to move forward in time
(down the history list).
Looking at the History Options Dialog Box
The History palette has five options
that change its behavior. To access
these options, choose History Options
from the History palette pop-up menu
to open the History Options dialog
box, shown in Figure 4-2. For a run-
down of the various settings, see
Table 4-1.

Taking Snapshots
Snapshots are duplicates of your image at a particular point in time, similar
to saving a document under an alternate name. (Photoshop automatically
names the snapshots generically Snapshot 1, Snapshot 2, and so on.)
However, snapshots are temporary copies, available only during your cur-
rent work session.

Taking Snapshots
197
Snapshots are a handy way to alternate between versions of an image when
you’re making major changes. For example, if you plan to apply several fil-
ters and adjustments that will drastically modify your image, you may want
to save a snapshot before you use the filters and apply the adjustments and
save another one after you’ve applied them. You can then click either snap-
shot to switch from one version to the other quickly, as shown in Figure 4-3.
The second you close a file, the snapshots you’ve taken disappear forever. If
you want a more permanent way of saving versions of your file, see the sec-
tion on using the Layer Comps palette in Book V, Chapter 2.
PhotoDisc
Figure 4-3: Use snapshots to compare before and after images when you apply a filter or

To take a snapshot, follow these steps:
1. Select the state at which you want to take a snapshot.
The state can be the most recent one with all your latest editing
changes, or an earlier state. Just make sure you take the snapshot
before your desired state is eliminated.
2. Choose New Snapshot from the palette pop-up menu.

The New Snapshot dialog box opens. Photoshop names your first snap-
shot Snapshot 1.
3. In the Name box, enter a name for the snapshot, preferably one that
helps you remember the contents of that particular snapshot.
You can add or change the name of the snapshot later by double-clicking
the snapshot name in the history list.
4. If you like, choose a snapshot subtype in the From menu.
Full Document, which is the default, creates a snapshot of all the layers
in the image at the currently selected state. It’ll probably suit your
needs. You can also take a snapshot of merged layers or just the current
layer. Book V explains working with layers.
5. Click OK to create the snapshot.
If you no longer need a snapshot, select the snapshot and click the trash-
can icon, drag the snapshot to the trash-can icon, or choose Delete from the
palette options menu.
Restoring Part of an Image
Although the concept may seem like
quantum physics, you can erase and
brush on an image by using previously
saved states or snapshots.
What? Okay, let me try this again.
You can erase portions of an image to
a history state, as well as paint on an
image from a history state. This means
that traveling through time doesn’t
have to be an all-or-nothing thing; you
can erase or paint portions of a differ-
ent state onto your currently active
state.
For example, suppose you applied a
blur filter to a face and decide later
you want to make the eyes sharp
again. You can use the Eraser tool with
the Erase to History option, or the
History Brush tool, to paint over the
eyes with information from an earlier
state before you blurred them, as
shown in Figure 4-4.

Using the Eraser with the Erase to History option
You’d want to use the Eraser with the Erase to History option when a por-
tion of an earlier state or snapshot contains information that you want to
include in an image that has otherwise been extensively edited. To erase
and restore to a portion of an earlier state or snapshot, just follow these
steps:
1. In the History palette, click in the far-left column of the state or snap-
shot you want to use as the source for the Eraser tool with the Erase
to History option.
A Brush icon appears in the History palette, indicating that Photoshop
will use this state as the source for the Eraser tool with the Erase to
History option.
2. Select the Eraser tool.
3. Choose the Erase to History option on the Options bar.
4. Choose any other Eraser tool options you want to use, such as Brush
size and type, Mode, Opacity and Flow percentages, or Airbrush.
Under Mode, you have the choice of using Brush, Pencil, or Block tip for
your brush.
5. Select the layer in the Layers palette and the state you want to erase
in the History palette.
6. Begin to erase.
Photoshop removes the image in the layer and replaces it with the
image in the state you specified as the source in Step 1. 
You can convert the Eraser tool temporarily to use the Erase to History option
by pressing the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) when you erase or paint. 
Using the History Brush tool
You can also use the History Brush tool to apply an image area from a differ-
ent state or snapshot to your current state. You’d want to use this tool to
restore a portion of an image to an earlier state, while leaving the rest of the
heavily modified image alone. The History Brush has an advantage over
the Eraser tool, in that you have access to the many different blend modes.
Just follow these steps:
1. In the History palette, click in the far-left column of the state or snap-
shot you want to use as the source for the History Brush tool (refer to
Figure 4-1).
A Brush icon appears, indicating that Photoshop will use this state as
the source for the History Brush tool.

In my example, I chose my original image just after cropping it.

You can also press Y or Shift+Y to select the tool.
3. On the Options bar, choose any other brush
options you want to use — such as Brush

centages, and Airbrush.
For details on the brush options, see Book IV,

4. Select the layer in the Layers palette and
select the state that you want to paint on in
the History palette.
5. Begin to paint.
Photoshop paints over the image in the layer
with the image from the state you specified as
the source in Step 1. In Figure 4-5, I painted
my original faces using a 10–15% opacity set-
ting over my Water Paper-filtered image. 
Using the Fill to History feature
If you can easily select the area you want to replace with a specific state,
you can use the Fill to History feature. Suppose you didn’t like the sky in a
particular image. You selected the sky area and then added clouds by using
the Clouds filter. Now you want to put the original sky back, but don’t want
to reverse any of the other edits you performed in the meantime. Just follow
these steps to replace an area by using the Fill to History feature:
1. Select a state as the source for the Fill to History function in the
History palette.
For example, select the state that has the original sky.
2. Choose the current state and use your favorite selection tools to
select the area you want to replace.
For example, if you remembered to save your original sky selection
when you originally added clouds, you can choose Select➪Load
Selection and retrieve that selection. Book III covers selection tools
in detail.
3. Choose Edit➪Fill and then select History from the Use pop-up menu.
4. Click OK to fill your selection with the image area from the selected
state.

Using the Art History Brush tool
The Art History Brush tool is an interesting variation on the plain old
History Brush tool. Both paint over an image by using information from a
previous state. The Art History Brush tool, however, includes several
choices on the Options bar that let you apply brush-stroke effects to your
image as you paint:
 Style: The Style menu contains various-shaped brush stroke styles, such
as Tight Short, Loose Medium, Dab, or Loose Curl.
 Area: This option controls the area covered by the paint stroke inde-
pendently of the brush size you select. The larger the size, the more
area covered.
 Tolerance: This option adjusts the amount of the change applied to
your image. A low tolerance value lets you apply strokes anywhere in
the image, regardless of color values. A high tolerance limits Art History
strokes to areas that are very different from the source state or snapshot,
making your image not quite as dramatically different from the original.
The result of using these options is an interesting hand-painted effect that
you can control quite easily after you have some practice.
The Art History Brush tool often works best when you use a state that is
quite different from the state you’re painting over. For example, you can
apply a heavy filter that makes the image almost unrecognizable and then
use that filtered image to paint with the Art History Brush tool. You can
even completely fill an image with color or texture and work with that.

When Photoshop won’t let you go back
Sometimes you may see a No symbol when
trying to use the Eraser with the Erase to History
option, the History Brush tool, or the Fill with
History command. You must be sure that your
current image is the same file size (same
number of pixels) as the state you are trying to
go back to. Actions such as cropping, trimming,
using the Image Size or Canvas Size commands,
or rotating any amount other than 180 degrees
can prevent you from going back to a previous
state. However, if you happen to have a square
image, you can rotate in 90-degree increments
and still use the Eraser with the Erase to History
option.

To paint with the Art History Brush tool, follow these steps:
1. Apply any effects you want to use to a chosen state.
I started by applying a Cutout filter to my sunflower.
2. Click in the far-left column in the History palette to select the state
you want to use as the source for the Art History Brush tool, as
shown in Figure 4-6.
3. Select the Art History Brush tool from the Tools palette.
You can also press Y or Shift+Y to select it.
4. Select from the choices on the Options bar.
Several of the options, such as Brush, Mode, or Opacity, are similar to
the options available with the ordinary Brush tool. The new options are
Style, Area, and Tolerance.
5. Paint with the brush to get the effect you want.
Don’t forget that you can use the History palette to reverse Art History
strokes that you change your mind about!

P
ractice makes perfect — but when repeating the same steps in
Photoshop over and over, the result is often tedium and
impatience. You wouldn’t want to have to reinvent the wheel
each time you wanted to go for a spin around the block,
so why repeat the labor needed to carry out specific
tasks if you don’t have to? 
Photoshop lets you record steps by using a fast and
fun feature called Actions. Photoshop actions are
similar to the macro recording features found in
your word processing or spreadsheet program, but
they’re usually easier to create and have capabilities
custom-tailored for image editing and customizing.
In addition, Photoshop has presets for popular
actions such as creating a wood frame, simulating
water reflections, or providing a molten-lead look. This
chapter shows you how to take advantage of Photoshop’s
presets, as well as its macro-recording and editing capabilities.
Using the Actions Palette
Not surprisingly, a palette is dedicated to the automation of various chores.
To view the Actions palette, choose Window➪Actions (or press F9, Opt+F9
on the Mac), or click the Actions icon in the dock. You can view the Actions
palette in two different modes, Button and List, each of which is useful in
its own way. You can access the mode you’re not currently using via the
Actions palette pop-up menu. 

Using the Actions Palette
204
Button mode is a convenient, compact mode that hides all the inner work-
ings of the actions, presenting only a button face that you can click to trig-
ger a particular macro. Button mode is fast and easy; just click and go.
List mode, shown in Figure 5-1, is the
default display in which each action is
shown as a folder-like heading. You
can open the heading to reveal all the
steps within the action or collapse the
heading to hide them. You need to be
in List mode when you record an
action and when you edit individual
steps. List mode also lets you perform
only some of the steps in an action.
When you’re working in List mode,
the Actions palette has these three
columns:
 The leftmost column contains
check boxes that you can select 
or deselect to include or exclude
actions (or steps within an action).
 The second column toggles on or
off the display of dialog boxes in
actions. Some actions include
options you can select while run-
ning the macro. For example, the
Vignette (Selection) action, which
creates a faded frame around a
selection, includes a dialog box
that lets you specify the width of
the fading. This dialog box is shown only when you select the dialog
box column; if you deselect the column, the action uses a default value.
Adobe refers to this as Modal control.
 The third and widest column shows the name of the set of actions
(folder icon) or the individual action. Click the right-pointing arrow to
the left of the action’s name to reveal the individual steps of the action.
If you have assigned any keyboard shortcuts to your action, they also
appear in this column.
At the bottom of the Actions palette in List mode, you find six icons, not all
of which are available at all times. The following list describes the icons
from left to right:

you create and store actions — a set of

tasks.

 Stop Playing/Recording: This icon is active when you’re recording an
action. Click it to stop recording (or to stop playing back an action).
 Begin Recording: Click this icon to begin recording an action (as
described in more detail later in this chapter).
 Play Selection: Click this icon to begin playing a selected action. Playback
begins at the step selected; you can choose the action’s name to start
the action at the beginning, or expand the action and select any step to
begin playback at that point.
 Create New Set: Click this icon to create a new action set (as I describe
later in this chapter).
 Create New Action: Click this icon to begin a new action.
 Delete: Click this icon to remove a selected action or step.
You can also find all these commands on the Actions palette pop-up menu.
Introducing Preset Actions
Preset actions are actions that have been created by the kind folks at Adobe
and come with Photoshop. You can also get other preset actions from Adobe’s
Web site as well as third-party vendors. You may need to load an action into
the palette so it’s ready to use. After an action is loaded, you can apply all
the steps in one fell swoop by playing the action. The following sections
explain how to work with preset actions in more detail.
Loading preset actions
Photoshop’s preset actions are located in a series of files in the Actions
folder. The default actions are loaded by, um, default, when you first open
Photoshop. However, other preset actions are available for you to open and
use. They include actions, such as Frames (for putting frames around your
images), Text Effects (for enhancing your text), and Image Effects, where
you can give your image the appearance of being aged or neon, for example.
Follow these steps to load preset actions:
1. In the Actions palette, click the palette pop-up menu arrow and
choose Load Actions.
Photoshop opens the Actions folder in the Presets folder in the Load
dialog box. This folder contains several sets of actions presets.
2. Select one of the actions sets.
Book II
Chapter 5
Creating Actions for
Productivity and Fun

Introducing Preset Actions
206
3. Click the Load button.
Even easier, Photoshop’s additional actions presets also appear at the
bottom of the Actions palette pop-up menu. You can add any of them to
your current list of actions by choosing the set’s name.
The new actions presets appear in the Actions palette, appended after
the default actions that are already there. You can show or hide the
actions in the Default Actions or Image Effects sets by clicking the
expand/collapse arrow in the third column.
You can also make actions available — or unavailable — for an entire set by
clicking the first column in the Actions palette next to the action set’s folder
icon.
Here are some other tidbits about loading and working with preset actions:
 Any action sets that you create yourself (as I describe later in this 
chapter) appear in the pop-up menu if you save them in the Photoshop
Actions folder. If you saved them somewhere other than the Actions
folder, you can navigate to that folder by using the usual file navigation
commands.
 To remove the existing actions and replace them with the set you are
loading, choose Replace Actions from the palette pop-up menu.
 To reset the Actions palette to the Default Actions set (removing all other
sets you may have loaded), choose Reset Actions from the palette pop-
up menu.
 To clear all actions from the Actions palette, choose Clear All Actions
from the palette pop-up menu. (You might want to do this when creat-
ing your own set of actions from scratch.)
 To rename an action set, select it and choose Set Options from the
palette pop-up menu.
Try a Google search for Photoshop Actions and you’re presented with a 
barrage of user-created actions, ranging from functional to funky. You can
then save these actions to your computer so you can then load them into
Photoshop. Remember: Check any file you download from the Internet for
viruses and other malware, using an antivirus or similar utility.
Playing a preset action
You perform an action on an image by playing it. To play a preset action, just
open the file you want to apply the action to and then do one of the following:
 In Button mode, click the action you want to play. There are no other
options.

Creating a New Action
207
 In List mode, select the action you
want to play, and then click the
Play Selection button at the
bottom of the Actions palette. You
can also choose Play from the
palette pop-up menu.
If you want to play back just one step
of an action, say, for testing purposes,
select the step you want to play in List
mode and then Ctrl+click (Ô+click
on the Mac) the Play button in the
Actions palette. You can also simply
double-click the step in the list while
holding down the Ctrl key (the Ô key
on the Mac).
If all goes well, you see your original
image transformed with a mere click of
the mouse, as shown in Figure 5-2.
Creating a New Action
When you create an action, you auto-
mate a series of steps. The hardest
part about creating a new action is fig-
uring out what functions you want to
automate. Think about steps that you
carry out over and over, and whether
you could be more productive if you
had an action that could do them for you. For example, you might want to
create your own action to reduce images to a constant width of 500 pixels
for display in an eBay auction. However, performing color-correction tasks
for your eBay images is more difficult to automate, because your images
may vary in their original color and contrast.
After you decide what you want to automate, examine the actual steps so
that you can record them. After that, creating a new action involves little
more than starting Photoshop’s macro recorder and carrying out the steps
you want to include in the action. 
While you’re working out the kinks in your action, I highly recommend that
you do so on a copy of your original file. That way, if things go awry, your
original file is safe from harm.

Here are the steps to follow to create a new action:
1. Open an image.
2. Display the Actions palette in List mode by unchecking Button Mode
from the palette pop-up menu.
3. Click the Create New Action
button at the bottom of the
Actions palette.
You can also choose New Action
from the palette pop-up menu.
The New Action dialog box opens,
as shown in Figure 5-3.
4. In the Name text box, enter a name for the action.
5. From the Set pop-up menu, choose the actions set. If you have more
than one actions set open, choose the actions set in which you want
to place the new action.
An action set is merely a folder that contains individual actions for orga-
nizational purposes. Feel free to use an existing set or create your own.
6. (Optional) To associate the action with a function-key shortcut, choose
the name of the function key from the Function Key drop-down list.
This step associates the action with a button on the keyboard. Function
keys like F2, F3, and so on are very useful for actions you perform all
the time.
Select the Shift or Ctrl (Shift or Ô on the Mac) check box to use either
of these keys along with the function key.
Any keyboard shortcut you assign to an action overrides the default
function already assigned to the keyboard shortcut. Keep in mind there
are a few exceptions where the operating system wins in the case of
a conflict. You can revert to the original shortcut by choosing Edit➪
Keyboard Shortcuts. See Book I, Chapter 5 for details. 
7. From the Color drop-down list, select a color to mark your action in
Button mode.
This option enables you to group related actions by color.
8. Click the Record button in the New Action dialog box to begin 
recording.
9. Carry out all the steps you want to record.
10. Click the Stop Playing/Recording button at the bottom of the Actions
palette to finish the action.
Your new action appears in the Actions palette, in both List and Button
modes.

Editing and Managing Actions
The first thing you need to do after you create a new action is to try it out
by opening an image and clicking the Play button in the Actions palette.
If the action doesn’t perform as you expect, you may need to edit your
action to fine-tune it. You also may need to edit an action to add features or
change the action’s behavior in some way. (For example, you might decide
that you want your resizing action to change the size to 45 percent rather
than 50 percent.) Photoshop enables you to edit your actions fairly easily.
Also keep in mind that certain actions won’t run on certain files. For exam-
ple, if your action involves adjusting the opacity of a layer and you run it on
an image without layers, it won’t work. You would have to include a step to
include the creation of a layer first.
You have a lot of editing options; you can change the action’s name, key-
board shortcut, or color-coding of an action. That’s easy enough: Just
double-click the action name in the Actions palette to enter a new name,
or select the action, choose Action Options from the palette pop-up menu,
and change the information as desired. You can also hold down the Alt key
(Option key on the Mac) and click the action’s name in the Actions palette
to open the Actions Options dialog box.
Re-recording an action
As easy as editing an action is, often your best option is to simply re-record
the action from scratch. If the action is not long or complex, you can often
re-record it in less time then you’d spend editing the existing action. You can
re-record an action two ways:
 Create a new action from scratch: Perform all the steps again to
replace the old action with a new one, saving the action with the same
(or a different) filename.
 Use the clever Record Again feature: Photoshop runs through the steps
you already recorded, opening the appropriate dialog boxes used the
first time around so you can enter new values. 
This Record Again method is very handy if you just want to change some
of the parameters but keep the steps the same and in the same order.
You don’t even have to remember what steps you used. Photoshop runs
through them for you as you record the steps, or macro, again.
To re-record a macro with the Record Again option, select the name of
the macro you want to re-record and choose Record Again from the
palette pop-up menu. As the different dialog boxes appear, enter the
values you want and click OK until the macro is finished.

Editing an action
You can also edit individual steps of an action. Here are some of the editing
changes you can make:
 Move a step: To move a step from one place in the action to another,
click the action you want to relocate and drag it to its new place in the
action list.
 Add a step in the middle: To add a new step in the middle of an exist-
ing action, select the step that you want to precede the new step. Click
the Record button and perform the steps you want to add. Click the
Stop Recording button when you finish.
 Add a step to the end: To add a new step at the end of an existing action,
select the name of the action, click the Record button, and perform the
steps you want to add. Click the
Stop Recording button when you
finish.
 Remove a step: Click the step you
want to delete and either drag the
step to the trash can icon, or click
the trash can icon and click OK
in the dialog box that pops up.
(Press the Alt key [Option key on
the Mac] to bypass the dialog box
and delete the step without confir-
mation.) You can also select a step
and choose Delete from the palette
pop-up menu.
 Duplicate a step: Press the Alt key
(Option key on the Mac) and drag
the step you want to duplicate to
another location in the Actions
palette. Photoshop then creates a
copy of the step, leaving the origi-
nal step where it was, as shown in
Figure 5-4. 
Creating Sets and Saving Actions
If you create your own sets of actions, you may want to include them
in custom sets that you can load or remove as needed. Just follow these
steps:
Figure 5-4: Duplicate a step in an action.

Batch Processing Actions
211
1. Display the Actions palette in List mode.
2. Click the Create New Set button in the Actions palette or choose New
Set from the palette pop-up menu.
The New Set dialog box appears.
3. Enter a name for your actions set.
4. Drag any existing actions you want to include from their locations in
the Actions palette to a new location within your new set folder.
5. Create any new actions you want to include within the new set.
6. Select the name of the set and choose Save Actions from the palette
pop-up menu.
7. Save the set in the Photoshop Actions folder or another folder of your
choice.
Batch Processing Actions
Photoshop’s Batch feature lets you apply an action to a group of files.
Suppose you want to make changes to a series of files. You could open each
file in Photoshop, play the desired macro, and then save the file. But that
might take a few minutes, or much longer if you have a lot of files to process.
If you want to keep your original file, too, you have to remember to save
each file in a new folder. Batch processing can automate tedious chores like
this for you.
To check out this useful tool, copy
some files (at least five or six) to a new
folder and follow these steps:
1. Make sure that all the files are in
a single folder of their own. Note
that any subfolders will be
included.
Photoshop by default works on all
the files in a folder. You have to
use Bridge if you want to choose
only some of them using the Batch
feature. You can find out more
about the Bridge in Book I,
Chapter 4.
2. Choose File➪Automate➪Batch.
The Batch dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 5-5.

3. From the Set pop-up menu, choose the set that contains the action
you want to apply.
If you have only one set of actions loaded, it appears by default.
4. Choose the action you want to apply from the Action pop-up menu.
5. From the Source pop-up menu, choose Folder.
You can also select Opened Files to process files you already opened in
Photoshop; Import to process a series of files captured with your scan-
ner or transferred from your digital camera; or Bridge to process files
you selected in the Bridge. File Browser is a good method for process-
ing files that do not appear in the same folder.
6. Click the Choose button, navigate to the folder you want to use, and
click OK (in Windows) or Choose (in Mac OS).
7. Select other options in the Source area, as desired. Here’s a descrip-
tion of your choices:
• Override Action “Open” Commands: Normally, Photoshop opens
each of the files in the selected folder automatically and processes
them — so your action doesn’t have to contain an Open command.
However, if the macro does contain an Open command, you want to
select this option. With this option active, Photoshop overrides
Open commands in the actions that use specific files (rather than
the batched files). 
• Include All Subfolders: Select this option to process files in subfold-
ers within the folder specified.
• Suppress File Open Options Dialogs: Select this option to have
Photoshop disregard any options that could be possibly selected
upon opening a file.
• Suppress Color Profile Warnings: When Photoshop opens a file
that contains its own color profile, it asks whether you want to
use that profile or Photoshop’s default profile. Selecting this check
box suppresses that choice; Photoshop always uses its own default
color profile. I explain color profiles in Book II, Chapter 2.
8. In the Destination area, tell Photoshop what to do with each file after
it is processed with the macro. Choose one of the following options
from the drop-down list:
• None: Leaves the file open on your Photoshop desktop without
saving it (unless the action itself contains a Save command).
• Save and Close: Closes the files in the same folder where Photoshop
found them. Your original file is overwritten, so use this option only
when you don’t want to save the original or have another copy.
• Folder: Saves the document in a folder.

Batch Processing Actions
213
9. If you chose Folder in Step 8, click the Choose button and navigate to
a destination folder for your files.
10. Select the Override Action “Save As” Commands check box to ignore
any Save As parameters in the action and use the filenames of the
files (as specified in the File Naming section described in Step 11).
11. In the File Naming section, specify how you want Photoshop to create
the filenames for the new, processed files by choosing from the pop-
up menus.
You can choose options from six pop-up menus, depending on how long
and complicated you want the filenames to be. Here are a few suggestions:
• You usually want to choose Document Name from the first pop-up
menu. If you do that, Photoshop retains the document name of
the original file. If your documents are named Sunset.tif,
Sunrise.tif, and Winter.tif, for example, the processed ver-
sions are given exactly the same names.
You can apply other choices in the pop-up menus, such as consecu-
tive serial numbers or mm/dd/yy choices, if you want. The serial
numbers choices create consecutive numbers (whether 1-, 2-, 3-, or
4-digit numbers), as well as serial letters (such as a, b, c or A, B, C)
for each file created.
• You’ll usually stick with the file’s extension in the second pop-up
menu. Choose extension to apply a lowercase version of the file’s
original extension, or EXTENSION to apply an uppercase version.
• Use the four additional pop-up menus if you want to create longer
and more complicated filenames.
For example, if you choose Document Name in the first pop-up
menu, 4 Digit Serial Number in the second pop-up menu, ddmmyy in
the third pop-up menu, and extension in the fourth pop-up menu, the
Sunset.tif, Sunrise.tif, and Winter.tif files are renamed
Sunset0001030307.tif, Sunrise0002030307.tif, and
Winter0003030307.tif if they’re saved on March 3, 2007.
When processing large numbers of files, these naming tools can help
you keep track of when and how the files were created.
12. Select the Windows, Mac OS, or Unix check box to specify what operat-
ing system you want the saved filenames to be most compatible with.
13. From the Errors pop-up menu, choose whether you want Photoshop
to stop processing a batch when it encounters an error or whether
you want it to simply continue and list the errors in a file. If you
choose the latter option, click the Save As button to specify a log file
and location for the log.

Creating Droplets
214
If you want to apply several different actions to a single set of files, or to
apply the same action to multiple folders of files, just create an action
that includes multiple batch-processing directives. To process multiple
folders, you can also deposit shortcuts (in Windows) or aliases (in Mac
OS) to each of the additional folders in the main source folder, and then
select the Include All Subfolders check box in the Source area.
14. When you’re done selecting options in the dialog box, click OK to
start the batch processing.
Creating Droplets
Droplets are drag-and-drop mini-applications — essentially applets — in
macro form that can exist outside of Photoshop on your desktop, on your
taskbar, or within a folder. They’re always available, so you can apply them
to any image files you want. Think of them as batches waiting to happen.
All you need to do is drag the file or files you want to process onto the
droplet. Photoshop doesn’t even have to be open at the time. When you
drop the file or files, the droplet opens Photoshop and carries out the steps
in the action embedded in the droplet’s instructions. You must use an exist-
ing action as the core of the droplet.
To create a droplet, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Automate➪Create
Droplet.
The Create Droplet dialog box
opens, as shown in Figure 5-6.
2. In the Save Droplet In area, click
the Choose button and enter a
name and location on your hard
drive for the droplet application.
The location isn’t of overriding
importance because after you
create the droplet, you can drag it
to your desktop, a toolbar, or
wherever you like.
The rest of the Create Droplet
dialog box is the same as the
Batch Processing dialog box
(described in the steps in the pre-
ceding section), except that you don’t have to specify a source.
Droplets use the files dropped on them as their source files.
Figure 5-6: Drag and drop files onto
droplets, mini-applications that reside
outside Photoshop.

3. In the Play area, choose the actions set, action, and options.
4. Select a destination from the Destination pop-up menu.
5. Specify any file-naming options you want.
6. Specify how Photoshop should process errors.
7. When you finish, click OK to create the droplet.
To use the droplet, just select the file, files, or folders you want to
process and drag them to the droplet applet.

Selections

I
f there’s one technique that separates the really
good Photoshop users from the wannabes, it’s
the ability to make a top-notch selection. Pick up
any tabloid and you’ll agree with me that a lot of
those wannabes seem to be gainfully employed!
This book, along with Book VI, gives you a com-
plete arsenal of selection commands, methods,
and techniques. In this book, I give you informa-
tion on how to create and modify selections and
paths by using various Photoshop tools, such as
the Marquee, Lasso, Magic Wand, Quick Selection
tool, and Pen tools. After you go through this
book, you can put those wannabes to shame.

Chapter 1: Making Selections
In This Chapter
 Capturing selections with the Marquee tools
 Roping selections with the lasso tools
 Picking up pixels with the Magic Wand tool
N
o matter how much you learn about Photoshop, if you can’t make a
good selection, your work will look like it belongs with the creatively,
(but poorly) composed images in those weekly tabloid rags. You know what
I’m talking about — those pictures that go alongside headlines like “Bat Boy
Wins Bake-Off” and “Woman with 16 Fingers Wins Typing Contest.”
Making accurate selections is the key to creating and editing images effec-
tively so that the end result looks flawless. Fortunately, Photoshop offers a
bevy of tools and techniques for creating selections, from the
simple to the complex. Photoshop offers three basic meth-
ods of creating a selection: using a selection tool or
method, using the Pen tool, or creating a mask.
In this chapter, I give you the foundation you need
to use the selection and pen tools. In fact, the rest
of Book III covers these tools in detail. I cover the
more complex method of masking in Book VI.
Defining Selections
The tools I discuss in this chapter require you to take
a little piece of a larger image so you can dig in and
make some serious edits. Defining a selection means that
you specify which part of the image you want to work with.
Everything within a selection is fair game for manipulation and is con-
sidered selected. Everything outside the selection is protected, or
unselected. Simple enough, right? Well, you can also have partially selected
pixels. Confused yet? A partially selected pixel has usually been anti-aliased,
feathered, or masked. (I cover anti-aliasing and feathering later in this chap-
ter. You can find out about masking in Book VI.)
When you use a selection tool to define a selection, a moving dotted outline
called a selection marquee appears.

Marqueeing When You Can
220
Marqueeing When You Can
Photoshop geeks call the selection marquee by a variety of names. Sometimes
it’s referred to as a marquee, other times as a selection, and you might even
hear people call it a selection outline, an outline, selection edges, or just
plain old edges. A favorite name for these dotted lines is marching ants.
Throughout the book, I usually call them selection marquees. Boring? Maybe.
Accurate? Yup. Whatever you want to call the selection marquee, how you
create one depends on the particular marquee tool or command you use.
The Marquee tools are the easiest selection tools to use — so I suggest that
you use them when you can.
In the Photoshop repertoire of tools, you find four types of Marquee tools:
Rectangular Marquee, Elliptical Marquee, Single Row Marquee, and Single
Column Marquee.
Using the Rectangular Marquee tool
The Rectangular Marquee tool creates rectangular or square selections.
It’s a good tool to use when you want to zero in on an image, plucking it
out of a larger background to provide a better focal point.
Here’s how to make a selection with the Rectangular Marquee tool:
1. Select the Rectangular Marquee tool from the Tools palette.
You can also use the keyboard shortcut — press the M key.
2. Drag from one corner of the area you want to select to the opposite
corner.
As you drag, the selection marquee appears. The marquee follows
the movement of your mouse cursor (a crosshair, or plus sign, icon).
For example, in Figure 1-1, I dragged from the lower-left corner to the
upper-right corner.
3. Release your mouse button.
You now have a full-fledged rectangular selection.
If you want to create a perfect square, press the Shift key after you begin
dragging. When you have your desired selection, release the mouse button
and then the Shift key. 
If you want to drag your selection from the center outward instead of from
corner to corner, press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) after you begin
dragging. When you have your desired selection, release your mouse button
and then release the Alt (Option on the Mac) key.

Marqueeing When You Can
221
Figure 1-1: The Rectangular Marquee selects part of your image.
Using the Elliptical Marquee tool
The Elliptical Marquee tool is designed for elliptical or circular selections.
You can easily select objects such as clocks, balls, and full moons with
this tool.
When you select with the Elliptical Marquee tool, you don’t drag from
corner to corner; you drag from a given point on the ellipse, which makes
the process a little tougher. Here are the steps:
1. Select the Elliptical Marquee tool from the Marquee flyout menu in
the Tools palette.
You can also use the keyboard shortcut. If the Elliptical Marquee tool is
visible, press the M key. If the Rectangular Marquee is visible, you must
press Shift+M.
2. Position the crosshair near the area you want to select and then drag
around your desired element.
As you drag, the selection marquee appears.

You may find it easier to create an elliptical selection by pressing the
Alt (Option on the Mac) key and dragging from the center outward. First
click the mouse button, and then before you move the mouse, press Alt
(Option on the Mac) and drag. Release your mouse and then the key
when you have your desired selection. If you want to draw from the
center out and you want a perfect circle, press the Shift key as well.
When you have your desired selection, release your mouse button and
then the Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) keys. This technique works
for creating squares also.
3. When you’re satisfied with your
selection, release your mouse
button.
Your elliptical selection is alive
and well, as shown in Figure 1-2. 
• If you need to move the selec-
tion marquee to better center
your selection, click and drag
inside the marquee.
• You can move a selection with
any of the Marquee tools by
pressing the spacebar while
you’re drawing.
• If the selection isn’t quite the
right shape and size, jump to
Book III, Chapter 2 to find out
how to make perfect selections.
Using the Single Column and 
Single Row Marquee tools
The Single Row and Single Column Marquee tools select a single row or
single column of pixels. If you don’t go blind using them, these tools can
occasionally come in handy for selecting and repairing a thin scratch or fold
line on an image or for getting rid of an artifact such as a colored line that
has somehow appeared on a scanned image. (You can find out more about
making repairs in Book VIII.)
To use either of these tools, simply choose a row or column of pixels on
your image and click it. You don’t have to do any dragging, but it does help
to zoom into your image so that you can better position the tool on the
offending row or column.

For more on zooming, see Book I, Chapter 4. Check out Figure 1-3 to get
familiar with a single row selection.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 1-3: The Single Row Marquee tool selects just one row of pixels.
The Single Row and Single Column Marquee tools don’t have keyboard
shortcuts, so you’re stuck with having to click the tools to select them.
Using the Marquee options
If drawing from the center outward or creating a perfect circle or square
doesn’t give you enough control, you may want to take a look at the mar-
quee settings provided by the Options bar. These options allow you to make
even more precise selections by specifying exact measurements.
You must select the options on the Options bar before you make your selec-
tion with the Marquee tools.
For now, you can ignore the first five icons on the left side of the Options
bar, as shown in Figure 1-4. The first icon has to do with tool presets, which
I cover in Book I, Chapter 2. The next four icons are the selection-state icons
(which I discuss in Book III, Chapter 3).

Here’s the lowdown on each of the remaining options:
 Feather: Feathering softens or feathers the edges of a selection.
The amount of softening depends on the radius — the higher the
radius, the softer the edge as shown in Figure 1-5. The radius measures
how far in all directions the feather effect extends.
You can use feathering to create a subtle and natural transition between
selections or to create a special effect where an image slowly fades out to
the background or to transparency. To feather as you are selecting, select
the Feather option on the Options bar before using the Marquee tools.
You can feather a selection after the fact by using the Select➪Modify
submenu. Check out Book III, Chapter 2 for more feathering details.
 Anti-alias: Whereas feathering completely blurs edges, anti-aliasing just
slightly softens the edge of an elliptical selection so that very hard, jagged
edges aren’t quite so prominent, as shown in Figure 1-6. You don’t have
an option for entering a pixel value for anti-aliasing. An anti-aliased edge
is always 1 pixel wide.
For the most part, I recommend keeping the Anti-alias option selected,
especially if you plan to create composite images. Anti-aliasing helps in
creating natural-looking blends between multiple selections. However, if
you want a crisp, linear edge, uncheck this option.

 Style: The Style drop-down list contains three settings:
• The Normal setting enables you to freely drag a selection to any
desired dimension.
• The Fixed Aspect Ratio option allows you to specify a ratio of width
to height in a selection. For example, if you enter 2 for width and 1
for height, you always get a marquee selection that’s twice as wide
as it is high, no matter what the size.
• You select Fixed Size to specify exact values for the Width and Height.
This option comes in handy when several images need to be the
same exact size, as in a row of headshots in a corporate brochure.
 Width and Height: When you select a Fixed Size from the Style drop-
down list, the Width and Height text boxes are available for you to enter
values. To swap between the Width and Height values, click the double-
headed arrow button.

Even though the default unit of measurement in the Width and Height
text boxes is pixels (px for short), you can enter any unit of measurement
that Photoshop recognizes — pixels, inches, centimeters, millimeters,
points, picas, or percents. After the number, simply type the word or
abbreviation of your desired unit of measurement. Photoshop even
lets you enter mixed units of measurements, so if you want a selection
100 pixels by 1.25 inches, you can specify that.
 Refine Edges: While you probably
won’t need to fine tune a simple
marquee selection, that’s what this
new option does. Refine Edges can
be applied to any selection and
appears in the Options bar of the
Marquee, Lasso, Magic Wand and
Quick Selection (where it will
come in handy) tools. You can
also apply this command to any
existing selection by choosing
Select➪Refine Edge. Here’s the
lowdown on the settings under
this option, shown in Figure 1-7:
• Radius: Improves the edge of
the selection where there are
soft transitions or a lot of
detail. Be sure and check
Preview to see the effect.
• Contrast: Removes artifacts
while tightening soft edges by
increasing the contrast. 
• Smooth: Smooths out jigs and
jags along the selection edge.
• Feather: Move the slider to increasingly create a softer, more
blurred edge.
• Contract/Expand: Decreases or increases your selection area. 
• Background icons: Allows you to preview your selection in various
modes. Choose from standard, Quick Mask, black background, white
background and mask (for more on masks of all sorts, see Book VI).
To cycle through all of the modes, simply press the F key.

Lassoing When You Can’t
Unfortunately, not much in life is perfectly rectangular or elliptical in shape.
Most of the time, you have to deal with irregular shapes with extrusions and
protrusions (otherwise known as bumps or bulges) of some sort. That’s where
the Lasso tools come in handy. This group of tools allows you to make
freeform selections.
Photoshop offers three Lasso tools: the Lasso tool itself (which I call the reg-
ular Lasso to distinguish it from the others), the Polygonal Lasso tool, and
the Magnetic Lasso tool. Each of the Lasso tools has its own special purpose
in the realm of freeform selections. But in the category of simplicity, they’re
all almost as easy to use as the Marquee tools. All you have to do is drag
around the part of the image you want to select. Just don’t indulge in too
much caffeine. A steady lasso hand is a good lasso hand.
The selection you make is only as good as how accurately you can trace
around your desired element. If you don’t make an exact selection the first
time around, you can always go back and make corrections (which I cover in
Book III, Chapter 3).
If, when making a selection, you find yourself fighting with your mouse
(and losing), you may want to invest in a digital drawing tablet, such as a
Wacom tablet. Using the stylus and the tablet can make mastering tools
such as the Lasso a whole lot easier.
The Lasso and the Polygonal Lasso tools both have only three choices on
the Options bar to worry about — Feather, Anti-aliased and Refine Edges.
These options work exactly like they do with the Marquee tools. To find out
more, check out the earlier section, “Using the Marquee options.”
Book III

Making Selections

Lassoing When You Can’t

To make a selection by using the Lasso tool, here’s what you do:
1. Select the Lasso tool from the Tools palette. 
It’s the tool that looks like (well, yeah) a rope. You can also use the key-
board shortcut; press the L key.
2. Position the cursor somewhere
on the edge of the element that
you want to select.
The hot spot (the lead point) of the
Lasso cursor is the end of the
rope. If you need a little visual
assistance, press your Caps lock
key, which will switch your cursor
to a crosshair.
Zoom in on the image a bit if the
element and the background don’t
have a lot of contrast. 
In my example, I started at the
top of the butte, as shown in
Figure 1-8.
3. Trace around the element, trying
to capture only what you want to
retain in your selection.
As you trace, a line forms that 
follows the movement of your
mouse.
Don’t release your mouse button
until you complete the selection by
closing the loop or returning to the
starting point. When you release
your mouse button, Photoshop
thinks you’re done and closes the
selection, as shown in Figure 1-9.
4. Continue tracing until you return
to your starting point; release the
mouse button.
Recognizing that you’re now done,
Photoshop presents you with a
selection marquee that matches
your lasso line (see Figure 1-10).

Selecting straight sides with 
the Polygonal Lasso tool
Whereas the regular Lasso tool is great for selecting undulating, curvy ele-
ments, the Polygonal Lasso tool shines when it comes to the more regimented,
straight-sided subjects such as city skylines, buildings, and stairways.
Unlike the regular Lasso tool, the Polygonal Lasso tool has rubber-band-like
qualities, and instead of dragging, you click and release the mouse button at
the corners of the object you’re selecting. It’s like a digital connect-the-dots.
(Bonus: less manual dexterity required.)
The following steps show you how to select with the Polygon Lasso tool:
1. Select the Polygonal Lasso tool from the Tools palette.
You can also use the keyboard shortcut. Press the L key and then press
Shift+L until you get the Polygonal Lasso tool. It looks like the regular
Lasso tool, but it has straight sides.

3. Move the mouse and click at the next corner of the object. Then con-
tinue clicking at the various corners of your object.
The line stretches out from each corner you click like a rubber band.
4. To close your selection, return to the first point you clicked and click
one last time.
When you place your cursor over the starting point, a small circle appears
next to your cursor, a sure sign that you’re at the right place for closing the
selection. A selection marquee that matches your Polygonal Lasso line
appears, as shown in Figure 1-11.
Figure 1-11: The Polygon Lasso tool is perfect for selecting 
straight-sided objects.
Which tool do you use if you have an object with both curves and straight
sides? You can have two, two, two tools in one! Press the Alt (Option on the
Mac) key to have the Polygonal Lasso tool temporarily transform into the
regular Lasso tool. Then drag to select the curves. Release the Alt (Option)
key to return to the Polygonal Lasso tool. This trick works with the other
Lasso tools as well.
Attracting with the Magnetic Lasso tool
The last member of the lasso tool trio is the Magnetic Lasso, which I admit
can be kind of tricky to use and sometimes even downright obstinate. The
Magnetic Lasso tool works by analyzing the colors of the pixels between the
elements in the foreground and the elements in the background. Then it
snaps to the edge between the elements, as if the edge had a magnetic pull.

Lassoing When You Can’t
231
The Magnetic Lasso tool performs best when your image has a lot of con-
trast between the foreground and background elements — for example, a
dark mountain range against a light sky or a shadow against a stucco wall.
The Magnetic Lasso tool also has some unique settings — which you can
adjust on the Options bar — to tame its behavior. I cover those settings in
the next section, “Adjusting the Magnetic Lasso options.” For now, follow
these steps to use the tool:
1. Select the Magnetic Lasso tool from the Tools palette.
You can also use the keyboard shortcut: Press the L key and then press
Shift+L until you get the Magnetic Lasso tool. The tool looks like a
straight-sided lasso with a little magnet on it.
2. Click the edge of the object you want to select.
You can start anywhere; just be sure to click the edge between the ele-
ment you want and the background you don’t want.
3. Move your cursor around the object, without clicking.
The Magnetic Lasso tool creates a selection line similar to the other
lasso tools. It also adds little squares called points along that selection
line, as shown in Figure 1-12. These points pin down the selection line
the way you might section off an area of your yard with ropes and
stakes.
• If the Magnetic Lasso tool starts veering off the edge of your object,
back up your mouse and click to force a point down on the line.
• If the Magnetic Lasso tool adds a point where you don’t want one,
simply press your Backspace (Delete on a Mac) key to delete it.
4. Continue moving your mouse around the object; return to your start-
ing point and release the mouse button to close the selection.
As with the Polygon Lasso tool, you see a small circle next to your
cursor indicating that you’re at the correct place to close the selection.
The selection marquee appears when the selection is closed.
Adjusting the Magnetic Lasso options
The Magnetic Lasso tool comes equipped with a few settings on the Options
bar that control the sensitivity of the tool.
I recommend starting out by messing around with the Magnetic Lasso tool
using its default settings. If the tool isn’t cooperating, then play with the
options.

Figure 1-12: The Magnetic Lasso tool detects the edge of your object.
The first icon has to do with tool presets, and the next four icons are the
selection state icons (check out Book III, Chapter 2). The Feather, Anti-alias
and Refine Edge options work like they do with the Marquee tools (see the
earlier section, “Using the Marquee options”). The following list explains the
remaining options:
 Width: This option, measured in pixels from 1 to 256, determines how
close to the edge you have to move your mouse before the Magnetic
Lasso tool recognizes the object you’re selecting. Decrease the value
if the object’s edge has a lot of indentations and protrusions or if the
image is of lower contrast. Increase the value if the image is of higher
contrast or has smoother edges.
When using the Magnetic Lasso tool, you can change the Width value
from the keyboard by pressing the left bracket ( [ ) key to lower the
value and the right bracket ( ] ) key to increase the value.
 Edge Contrast: Measured in percentages from 1 to 100, this option spec-
ifies the required contrast between the object you’re selecting and its
background before the Magnetic Lasso tool hugs the edge between
them. If your image has good contrast between the foreground and
background, use a higher percentage.
 Frequency: This setting, measured in percentages from 0 to 100, specifies
how many points to place on the selection line. The higher the percent-
age, the greater number of points. If the object you want to select has a
Magnetic Lasso point

fairly smooth edge, keep the percentage low. If the edge is jagged or has
a lot of detail, a higher percentage may be more effective in getting an
accurate selection line.
 Tablet Pressure (Pen icon): If you own a pressure-sensitive drawing
tablet, select this option to make an increase in stylus pressure cause
the edge width to decrease.
Performing Wand Wizardry
The Magic Wand. The name is intriguing, isn’t it? Any tool that has the
audacity to call itself the Magic Wand must be so powerful that it can grant
your every selection wish with a mere swoosh. Unfortunately, it’s not quite
so awe-inspiring. A better name for this tool would be the Click-’n-Select tool.
You click your image, and the Magic Wand tool makes a selection, which
contains areas of similar color, based on the color of the pixel you clicked.
Simple enough. What’s not quite so simple is how to determine how similar
the color has to be to get the Magic Wand tool to select it. That’s where the
important Tolerance setting comes in. Before you tackle tolerance (and find
out how it affects the Magic Wand tool’s
performance), you first need to get the
hang of using the Magic Wand tool.
Selecting with the 
Magic Wand tool
As with the Magnetic Lasso tool, the
Magic Wand tool works best when you
have high-contrast images or images
with a limited number of colors. As
shown in Figure 1-13, a black-and-white
checkered flag is a perfect example of
something that the Magic Wand tool
effectively selects. I click once on the
top of a black square, and the Magic
Wand tool picks up all the other sur-
rounding black pixels. I can now easily
change the color of my black squares
to red or yellow in one fell swoop.
As you can see, Figure 1-14 is a poor
candidate. This image contains a ton
of colors — and no really definitive
contrast between the scale and the
background. Although it takes only
one click to select the black squares
on the flag, other high-contrast

candidates may take a few clicks. And some images may need a tweak or
two of the Tolerance setting, described in the next section.
Setting your tolerance
Sometimes an image may contain a few shades of a similar color. Consider a
cloudless sky for example. A few shades of blue make up the bright blue
yonder. With the Magic Wand tool, if you click a darker shade of blue in the
sky, Photoshop selects all similar shades of blue, but the lighter shades
remain unselected. This is usually a sure sign that you need to increase
your Tolerance level. The Tolerance setting determines the range of color
that the Magic Wand tool selects.
Tolerance is based on brightness levels that range from 0 to 255:
 Setting the Tolerance to 0 selects one color only.
 Setting the Tolerance to 255 selects all colors — the entire image.
To use the Magic Wand tool and adjust Tolerance settings, follow these steps:
1. Select the Magic Wand tool from the Tools palette.
It now shares the same flyout menu with the new Quick Selection tool.
Press the W key and then the Shift W key until you get a tool that looks
like the weapon of choice for many Disney characters.
2. Click the portion of the image that you want to select; use the default
Tolerance setting of 32.
The pixel that you click determines the base color. The default value of
16 means that the Magic Wand tool selects all colors that are 32 levels
lighter and 16 levels darker than the base color.
If you selected everything you wanted the first time you used the Magic
Wand tool, stretch your arm and give yourself a pat on the back. If you
didn’t (which is probably the case), go to Step 3.
3. Enter a new Tolerance setting on the Options bar.
If the Magic Wand tool selected more than you wanted it to, lower the
Tolerance setting. If it didn’t select enough, raise the setting.
4. Click again the portion of the image that you want to select.
Changing the Tolerance level doesn’t adjust your current selection.
The Magic Wand tool deselects the current selection and makes a new
selection — based on your new Tolerance setting, as shown in Figure 1-15.
If it still isn’t right, you can adjust the Tolerance setting again. I regret
that I can’t give you a magic formula that you can use to determine the
right value. It’s all about trial and error.

Figure 1-15: Finding the right Tolerance is the key to selecting with the Magic Wand.
Using the Magic Wand Options bar
If you get a selection close to what you want, stop there and then use the
selection-refining techniques I discuss in Book III, Chapter 2. But before you
do that, you need to know about the other Magic Wand settings on the
Options bar. Besides Anti-alias and Refine Edge, which I discuss in the ear-
lier section, “Using the Marquee options,” the three remaining options are
as follows:
 Contiguous: When you turn on this option, the Magic Wand tool selects
only pixels that are adjacent to each other. If you turn off the option, the
Magic Wand tool selects all pixels within the range of tolerance, whether
or not they’re adjacent to each other.
 Sample All Layers: This option is valid only when you have multiple
layers in your image. (For more on layers, see Book V.) If you have multi-
ple layers and this option is on, the Magic Wand tool selects color from
all visible layers. If you turn off this option, the Magic Wand selects
colors from the active layer only.

 Sample Size: Although this option affects the Magic Wand tool, it appears

and, in the Sample Size pop-up menu that appears, choose from the 
following:
• Point Sample: Samples just the color of the pixel you clicked

We all never have enough time. Luckily, Adobe heard our cries and gave
us a great new tool. Think of it as a combo Brush, Magic Wand, Lasso tool.
Easy to use — with surprisingly good results —  it is sure to become part of
your selection arsenal.
Here’s how to make short work of selecting with this tool:
1. Select the Quick Selection tool from the Tools palette.
The tool looks like a wand with a marquee around the end. It shares the
same flyout menu with the Magic Wand tool. You can also press the W key. 
2. If you are making a new selection, be sure that the default selection
option, New selection, in the Options bar, is selected.
3. Choose your desired brush settings from the Brush picker in the
Options bar.

4. If your image has layers and you wish to make a selection from all of
the layers, select the Sample All Layers options. If left unselected, you
will only select from the current layer.
5. Check the Auto-Enhance option to have Photoshop assist you with
automatically refining your selection by implementing an algorithm.
6. Drag, or paint, your desired areas of your image. Your selection will
grow as you drag, as shown in Figure 1-16. 
If you stop dragging and click in another portion of your image, your
selection will include that clicked area.

7. Change your selection as needed.
You have three options here:
• To add to your selection, press the Shift key while dragging across
your desired image areas. 
• To delete from your selection, press the Alt (Option on the Mac) key
while dragging across your unwanted image areas. 
• You can also select the Add to selection and Subtract from selection
options in the Options bar.
8. If you need to further fine tune your selection, click the Refine Edges
option in the Options bar.

A
lthough the Marquee, Lasso, and Magic Wand tools are fun, friendly,
and pretty easy to wield, sometimes they don’t quite have the horse-
power to make that really precise selection. So either you spend a lot of 
time cleaning up what you’ve selected (see Book III, Chapter 3 for more on
that topic), or you live with a ho-hum selection. That’s where the
Pen tool and its related cronies come to the rescue. The Pen
tool creates paths — which you can then convert into
selections.
Because the Pen tool (along with the related path-
editing tools) offers control and precision, it can
nail that accurate selection. The only problem is
that the Pen tool is a far cry from fun, friendly, and
easy. Many new users try the Pen a few times, but
end up muttering in disgust and returning grate-
fully to the Lasso tool. However, I guarantee that if
you dedicate a good chunk of time to mastering the
Pen tool, you’ll soon turn your elite little nose up at
the simple Lasso tool.
Introducing Paths
Unlike the other selection tools, the Pen tool doesn’t initially produce a
selection marquee. When you select the Pen tool and start clicking and
dragging around your image, you create a path. Paths have three types of
components — anchor points, straight segments, and curved segments.

Introducing Paths
240
Curved paths are called Bézier paths
(after Pierre Bézier — who, in the
1970s, invented the equation used for
CAD/CAM programs). They are based
on a mathematical cubic equation
where the path is controlled by direc-
tion lines that end in direction points
(often referred to as handles), as
shown in Figure 2-1. The length and
angle of direction lines control the
pitch and angle of the Bézier curve.
Figure 2-1 and the following list intro-
duce the different kinds of anchor
points that Photoshop puts at your
disposal and show you exactly what
they do. You can use some or all of
these anchor points in a single path:
 A true corner point has no direc-
tion lines. Use corner points when
selecting objects with straight
sides, such as stairs or barns.
 A smooth point has two direction
lines pointing in opposite direc-
tions but dependent on one
another. Use smooth points when
selecting objects that have alter-
nating curves, such as a sea of rolling waves.
 A cusp point has two direction lines that are independent of one
another. Use cusp points when selecting an object with curves going
the same direction, such as the petals on a daisy.
 A point between a straight segment and a curve is a corner point with
only one direction line.
After you create a Bézier path, you can then edit the path by moving,
adding, deleting, or converting anchor points and by manipulating the
direction lines. You can also transform paths by choosing Edit➪Transform
Paths. With transforming, you can scale, rotate, skew, distort, or change the
perspective of the path (see Book III, Chapter 3 for details).
The path hovers over the image in its own space. You control it via the
Paths palette, where you can save it, duplicate it, stroke it with color (apply

color to the edge only), fill it with color or a pattern, and most importantly,
load it as a selection. I say “most importantly” because nine times out of ten,
you painstakingly create a path as a means to an accurate selection mar-
quee. You may use the path as a clipping path one other time: to hide a part
of a layer or part of an entire image.
Creating a Path with the Pen Tool
The best way to get the hang of the Pen tool is to dive right in and work with
it. You’ll want to start with straight lines, which are very easy, and then
move on to the more difficult curves. The more you practice with the Pen,
the more comfortable and proficient you’ll become. It definitely is an exam-
ple of the old adage “you get out what you put into it.”
Knowing your Pen tool options
Although every path consists of three basic components — segments,
points, and direction lines — the Pen tool enables you to use these compo-
nents to create a few different types of paths. See Book IV, Chapter 2 for
more information on the following options, accessible from the Pen tool’s
Options bar. You must choose one of the following:
 Shape Layers: This option creates a shape on a new layer that’s called,
not surprisingly, a shape layer. After you create the path that defines
the shape, Photoshop fills the shape with the foreground color and
stores the path as a vector mask in the Paths palette. A shape layer is a
unique entity.
 Fill Pixels: This option is available only when you’re using the shape
tools. It allows you to create a shape and fill it with the foreground
color, but it does not create a shape layer nor does it retain the path.
 Paths: This option enables you to create a traditional path that hovers
over the image. The path you create is a work path — which is tempo-
rary, appears in the Paths palette, and is unsaved. If you’re creating a
path that you’ll eventually load as a selection, this is your option.
Creating your first work path
Making a work path is the easiest of the three options, and you’ll use it fre-
quently after you get the hang of using the Pen tool. The following steps
show you how to create a simple, straight path:
Book III

Rarely (if ever) will you create a work path that’s a single, straight line.
Please keep reading the other sections in this chapter.
1. Open an image you want to practice on.
I suggest choosing an image that has an element with both straight
edges and curves, if you want to also practice creating curved paths
later.
2. Select the Pen tool from the Tools palette.
Or you can just press the P key.
3. On the Options bar, click the Paths button.
You can see this button in Figure 2-2.

4. To create a straight line, click and release your mouse button at the
points where you want the line to begin and to end, leaving anchor
points at those positions.
You don’t need to do any dragging to create straight segments. As you
click and add your anchor points, Photoshop creates straight segments
that connect the anchor points, as shown in Figure 2-3.
Figure 2-3: Drawing straight lines with the Pen requires nothing more 
than clicks with the tool.
5. To draw a constrained line — horizontal, vertical, or 45° angle —
press the Shift key as you click.
6. To end the path, click the Pen tool in the Tools palette to deselect it.
Or use this very handy shortcut:

Continue on to the following sections if you want to add other kinds of
segments to the path. Otherwise, skip to “Closing a path,” later in this
chapter.
Drawing curves
You’re probably never going to create a simple work path that doesn’t have
curves as well as straight lines. I mean, not much in life is perfectly linear.
Most things have undulations here and there. Picking up from the preceding
section, here’s how to create curved paths:
1. If you’re adding on to a previously created open path, be sure to posi-
tion your cursor on the last anchor point you created on that open
path before you continue.
You see a slash mark or a small square appear next to your cursor. If you
are starting a new path, position the cursor where you want the curve
to begin. 
2. Whichever appears — the slash mark or the square — drag toward
the direction you want the bump of the curve to go. Release the
mouse button when you’re done.
Here are some quick pointers for this stage of the procedure:
• If you are creating a new path, an anchor point and two direction
lines, which have direction points at their ends, appear. If you are
adding a curve to your straight segment, an anchor point and one
direction line with one direction point appear. The direction lines
and direction points control the angle and pitch of the curve.
• How do you know how far you should drag? You can do what I do
and use the rule of thirds. Imagine that your curve is a piece of
string that you have stretched and laid out in a straight line. Divide
that line into thirds. The distance you drag your mouse cursor is
approximately one-third the length of that line.
• How do you establish the angle? Drag straight from the anchor point
for a steeper curve and at an angle from the anchor point for a flat-
ter curve. The element in my example is a flatter curve; therefore I
dragged up and to the right at an angle of about 4.5 degrees, as
shown in Figure 2-4.

Creating a Path with the Pen Tool
245
Figure 2-4: Dragging at an angle of about 4.5 degrees begins the path 
of the flat curve.
3. Move the cursor to the end of the curve and drag in the opposite
direction, away from the bump.
You now see another anchor point and a set of two direction lines and
points. Photoshop creates the curve segment between the anchor
points, as shown in Figure 2-5.
• If you drag both direction lines in the same direction, you create a
curve shaped like an S.
• On the Options bar, click the down-pointing arrow at the end of the
row of tools and choose the Rubber Band option. With this option
selected, Photoshop draws a segment between the last anchor point
you create and wherever your cursor is located, giving you a kind of
animated preview of how the path will appear. I personally find the
option distracting, but some users love it.
4. To draw more alternating curves, just repeat these steps, dragging in
an opposite direction each time.

Figure 2-5: Finish the curve by dragging in the opposite direction.
Connecting a straight segment to a curve segment
If you need to create a straight segment after creating a curve (or vice versa),
you need to convert the point where the path changes from curved to straight.
To convert a point, follow these steps:
1. Position your cursor over the second anchor point in the existing
curve and press the Alt key (Option on the Mac).
You see a caret (which looks like an upside down V) next to the Pen
cursor.
2. Click and release your mouse button over the anchor point.
The bottom direction line disappears. You have converted a smooth
point into a corner point with one direction line. This action now allows
you to create a straight segment.
It’s no coincidence that the tool icon for the Convert Point tool is also a
caret. Whenever you see a caret symbol in Photoshop, it’s an indication
that you are converting an anchor point, from smooth to corner or vice
versa.
Curve segment
Direction line

3. Move your mouse to the end of the straight edge you want to select
and click and release.
You can press the Shift key if you want the line to be constrained hori-
zontally, vertically, or at an angle with a multiple of 45 degrees.
Photoshop connects the two anchor points with a straight segment, as
shown in Figure 2-6.
Figure 2-6: To connect a straight segment to a curve segment, you 
must first convert the point.
Connecting curve segments with cusp points
If you want to create a curve that goes in the same direction as a curve that
is adjacent to it, you have to take a couple additional steps:
1. Convert the point — this time from smooth to cusp — by positioning
your cursor over the second anchor point in the existing curve and
pressing the Alt key (Option on the Mac).
2. Drag toward the bump of the curve. Release the mouse button and
then release the Alt (Option on the Mac) key.

Essentially, your actions are pulling the direction line out from the anchor
point. Both direction lines move to the same side of the anchor point,
yet are independent of each other, creating the cusp point, as shown in
Figure 2-7.
Figure 2-7: You can connect two curves that go in the same direction 
with a cusp point.
3. Move your cursor to where you want the curve to end and drag away
from the bump to create your second curve.
Try to keep anchor points on either side of the curve, not along the top.
It is also good to try to use the fewest number of anchor points possible
to create your path. That way, the path results in a much smoother
curve. It also can reduce the possibility of printing problems. 
To draw a curve after a straight segment, first position your cursor
directly on the last anchor point of the straight segment. Drag toward
the bump of the curve you need to draw. A direction line appears.
Position your cursor where you want the curve to end and drag away
from the bump.
Closing a path
To close the path, return to your first anchor point and click. You see a
small circle next to your Pen cursor, indicating that you’re closing the path
when you click.

Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a work path (see Figure 2-8).
Don’t worry if the path isn’t perfect; you find out how to edit paths in an
upcoming section. If your path is perfect and you want to save it now, skip
ahead to the section, “Working with the Paths Palette.”
Figure 2-8: To close your work path, return to your first anchor point and click.
If your path is incomplete and you want to continue drawing it, either click
or drag on the endpoint with the Pen tool. You see the appearance of a slash
mark or small square next to the Pen cursor.
Creating subpaths
You can also create a series of lines or curves. For example, you may want
to create a border consisting of some decorative curve shapes, which you
could later stroke with color. You can then save these subpaths under a
single path name. To create a series of subpaths, simply end one path
before starting another. Make sure that the paths are not hidden when you
do so; otherwise, Photoshop eliminates the previous path when you start
another.

Working with the Paths Palette
Working hand in hand with the Pen tool is the Paths palette. You can think
of it as a kind of Command and Control Center for your paths. Although it
isn’t mandatory, opening up your Paths palette (shown in Figure 2-9) is a
good idea before you create a path so
you can stay apprised of what’s hap-
pening with your image. To open the
palette, choose Window➪Paths.

Figure 2-9, are
 Fill Path

The following sections highlight some
of the stuff you can do with the Paths
palette.
Creating a path
When you create a path, it automatically appears in the Paths palette as a
work path.
Remember that a work path is temporary and unsaved, and you can have
only one work path in the Paths palette at a time.
If the work path is selected when you begin another path, your actions are
added to the current work path. But if the existing work path is hidden and
you begin drawing another path, that new work path replaces the existing one.
Creating a new path
You can save yourself a lot of grief if you make sure that your path is saved
before you start. If you select New Path from the Paths palette pop-up menu
before you create the path, Photoshop automatically saves the work path,

to save, delete, stroke, fill, and make

and it becomes a saved path (also called a named path). You can also just
click the Create New Path icon at the bottom of the Paths palette.

angle in the upper right to open the menu). Then provide a name in the Save
Path dialog box and click OK.
After you save your path, you can reload it at any time. Unlike layers, paths
take up very little storage space, so don’t hesitate to save them. Plus, you
don’t want to go through all that work again if you don’t have to. Unlike
work paths, you can have as many saved paths as your heart desires.
Deleting, duplicating, and renaming a path
To delete a path, drag the path to the trash can icon at the bottom of the
palette. Or choose Delete Path from the Paths palette pop-up menu.
You can duplicate a saved path by choosing the path in the Paths palette
and selecting Duplicate Path from the Paths palette pop-up menu. You can
also drag the saved path on top of the Create New Path icon at the bottom
of the palette.
To rename a path, double-click the path name in the Paths palette. Then
enter the new name directly within the palette.
Stroking a path
You can use the Stroke Path command to paint a stroke along the path. You
can choose which painting or editing tool to use to stroke the path. Follow
these steps:
1. Select the path in the Paths palette. Then choose Stroke Path from the
Paths palette pop-up menu.
Or press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and click the Stroke path with
the brush icon (an outlined circle) at the bottom of the palette. 
You can also click the Stroke Path icon without the Alt (Option on the
Mac) key. Note that this option bypasses the dialog box in Step 2 and
just strokes your path with whatever setting you used previously.
2. In the dialog box that opens, choose one of the 16 painting or editing
tools you want to use to apply color to the stroke. Click OK.
Book III
Chapter 2
Creating and
Working with Paths

Working with the Paths Palette
252
Make sure that you verify your
chosen tool’s settings on the
Options bar because Photoshop
uses those settings to stroke your
path. Photoshop also applies your
current foreground color to the
stroke.
If you’re using a pressure-sensitive
drawing tablet, you can select the
Simulate Pressure check box to
create strokes with varying
widths. If everything has gone
well, you end up with a stroked
path like the one shown in Figure 2-10.
If you select one or more paths with the Direct Selection tool, the Stroke
Path command changes to Stroke Subpath(s), enabling you to stroke only
the selected paths.
Although paths themselves live in their own space, independent of layers,
and don’t print, once you stroke or fill them they do become part of your
image layer and they will print. Make sure the layer that is currently active
is the one you want your stroked or filled path to appear on before you per-
form the operation.
Filling a path
You can fill the interior of a path with color by choosing the Fill Path com-
mand. Follow these steps:
1. Select the path in the Paths palette and choose Fill Path from the
Paths palette pop-up menu.
A dialog box gives options for Contents, Opacity, Blending, and
Rendering. Briefly, for your Contents, choose between colors, pattern,
or history. (For more on the Contents and Opacity options, see Book IV,
Chapter 2.)
Or you can press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and click the Fill Path
with Foreground Color icon (a solid circle) at the bottom of the palette.
You can also click the Fill icon without the Alt (Option on the Mac) key.
This option bypasses the dialog box and just fills your path with what-
ever setting you used previously.
2. In the dialog box, leave the Blending Mode option set to Normal.
Using the Layers palette to apply your blend modes is better because
you have more flexibility (see Book V for more on layers). Here is the
scoop on the remaining options:
Figure 2-10: Photoshop allows you to
easily apply a stroke of color to your paths.

Loading Paths as Selections
253
• The feathering option gradually blurs the edges of the fill into the
background. Enter the Feather Radius in pixels. The more pixels, the
greater the blur or feather.
• The anti-alias option just slightly
softens the very edge of the fill
so it doesn’t appear as ragged.
If you select one or more paths
with the Direct Selection tool, the
Fill Path command changes to Fill
Subpath(s), enabling you to fill
only the selected paths.
3. After you set your options,
click OK.
Your path now is filled — similar to
mine, which is shown in Figure 2-11.
Loading Paths as Selections
Creating a path is usually the means to an end — an accurate selection.
Therefore, you’ll frequently use the Paths palette to load your path as a
selection.
Follow these steps to get the lowdown on how to do just that. Open an
image, make a selection by using the Pen tool, and get started.
1. Choose Make Selection from the Paths palette pop-up menu.
Alternatively, you can also press Alt (Option on the Mac) and click the
Load Path as Selection icon in the Paths palette. 
To bypass the Make Selection dialog box, simply click the Load path as
Selection icon at the bottom of the Paths palette.
2. Feather or anti-alias your selection in the Make Selection dialog box.
You have these options:
• Feather your selection by entering a pixel value in the Feather
Radius box. (For more on feathering, see Book III, Chapter 3.)
• Leave the feather radius at 0 for a hard-edged selection.
• Select the Anti-aliased option. This option slightly softens the edge
of the selection so that it doesn’t appear so jagged. (It’s my personal
recommendation.)
If you happen to have another selection active when you load your cur-
rent path as a selection, you can choose to add, subtract, or intersect
with that other selection.
Book III
Chapter 2
Creating and
Working with Paths
Figure 2-11: If stroking your path with
color isn’t enough, you can fill it instead.

Turning a Selection into a Path
254
After the path is made into a selec-
tion (as shown in Figure 2-12), it
acts like any other selection.
If you need a selection refresher,
see Book III, Chapter 1. If you want
to save your selection (saving a
selection creates an alpha chan-
nel), jump ahead to Book VI,
Chapter 1 where I explain details
on working with channels.
Here’s one of my favorite shortcuts: To
quickly load the path as a selection,
select the path and then press Ctrl+Enter (Ô+Return on the Mac). You can
also Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) on your path name in the Paths palette
to do the same. Just be aware that you bypass the dialog box and its
options when you use the shortcuts.
Turning a Selection into a Path
Although you probably won’t use this option nearly as often as you use the
option to turn a path into a selection, the option is, indeed, available: You
can create paths from existing selections.
Creating a path from a selection can come in handy if you need to save a
path as a clipping path (that’s because areas of the image outside the path
are hidden).
1. If you’ve been reading from the beginning of this chapter, you proba-
bly have a selection on-screen ready and raring to go. If you’re just
now jumping in, select the desired element in your image.
2. With the selection marquee active, select Make Work Path from the
Paths palette pop-up menu.
3. In the dialog box that appears, enter a Tolerance value.
You can also create a path from a selection by pressing Alt (Option on
the Mac) and clicking the Make Work Path from Selection icon in the
Paths palette. If you just click the icon, you also make a path, but you
bypass the dialog box.
The Tolerance value controls how sensitive Photoshop is to the nooks
and crannies in the selection when it creates the path:
Figure 2-12: The main reason to create a
path is to achieve an accurate selection.

Using the Kinder Freeform Pen
255
• The lower the value, the more sensitive it is, and the more closely
the selection follows your path.
• Too low a value, such as 0.5, may create too many anchor points.
• Too high a value, such as 10 (the max), rounds out your path too
much. Start with the default setting of 2.0.
You can always tweak the path later (check out “Editing Paths” later in
this chapter).
4. If the path is still showing, simply click in the gray area below the
path names in the Paths palette.
This action deselects the path.
5. Select the work path in the Paths palette and choose Save Path from
the Paths palette pop-up menu. Name the path and click OK.
Using the Kinder Freeform Pen
Confession: There is a more amicable incarnation of the Pen tool — the
Freeform Pen tool. This tool is kind of a hybrid Lasso/Pen tool. Just drag
around the element you want to select, and the tool creates an outline that
follows your cursor, exactly like the Lasso.
After you release your mouse button, Photoshop provides the anchor points,
lines, and curves for that path. In this case, the Freeform Pen works exactly
like the Pen.
In my humble opinion, the Freeform Pen rates just an okay. The downside is
that you are back to needing a really steady hand in order to get an accurate
selection. The tool is probably one notch better than the Lasso tool because
you do get a path that you can refine before you load it as a selection. But I’d
rather pay my dues and get skilled with the regular Pen.
Here are some Freeform Pen tips:
 To create straight segments with the Freeform Pen, press Alt (Option on
the Mac) while pressing the mouse button and then click to create the
anchor point.
 Pressing Alt (Option on the Mac) temporarily turns the Freeform Pen
into the regular Pen. When you want to return to drawing curves,
release Alt (Option on the Mac), keeping the mouse button pressed.
Book III
Chapter 2
Creating and
Working with Paths

Using the Kinder Freeform Pen
256
Be careful: If you release Alt (Option
on the Mac) after releasing the mouse
button, Photoshop ends your path,
and you can do nothing about it.
The following sections give you the
scoop on the options, which you can
find by clicking the down-pointing
arrow on the Options bar, that go hand
in hand with the Freeform Pen tool
(see Figure 2-13).
Curve Fit
The Curve Fit option lets you adjust the amount of error Photoshop allows
when trying to fit your cursor movement to a path. You can enter a value
from 0.5 to 10 pixels; the default setting is 2 pixels.
At the default setting, Photoshop doesn’t register any movement of your
cursor that is 2 pixels or less. Setting the value to 0.5 pixels makes the
Freeform Pen very sensitive to your movement and forces the tool to very
closely follow the edge.
The disadvantage of this option is that using it also causes a lot of unneces-
sary anchor points. Although a value of 10 pixels corrects this problem by
making the option less sensitive, your path may not be as accurate if you
back off on the sensitivity.
I recommend trying the Freeform Pen at each of these settings and then get-
ting a feel for the kind of path it makes.
Magnetic
When selected, the Magnetic option makes the Freeform Pen act much like
the Magnetic Lasso tool. Click anywhere on the edge of the element you
want to select. Release your mouse button and then move the cursor
around the edge. The tool snaps to the edge of your element, creating
anchor points and segments. You can
 Manually control the magnetism: If the Freeform Pen tool starts to veer
off course, you can force an anchor point down manually by clicking.
 Create straight segments: To create straight segments, again press
Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) to temporarily get the regular Pen.
Alt+drag (Option+drag on the Mac) to temporarily access the regular
Freeform Pen. To return to the magnetic Freeform Pen tool, release Alt
(Option on the Mac), click again, and continue moving the cursor.
Figure 2-13: The Freeform Pen is a cross
between the Lasso and the Pen tools and
requires a steady hand to create paths.

Creating Paths without the Pen
257
To close a path with the magnetic Freeform Pen, double-click or return to
your starting anchor point.
Width, Contrast, Frequency, and Pen Pressure
The Width, Contrast, and Frequency settings are specifically for the
Magnetic option and work just like the Magnetic Lasso options. Width speci-
fies how close to the edge (1–256) the tool must be before it detects an edge.
Contrast (1–100) specifies how much contrast must be between pixels for
the tool to see the edge. And Frequency (0–100) specifies the rate at which
the tool lays down anchor points. For more details, see Book III, Chapter 1.
The Pen Pressure option is available only if you’re using a pressure-sensitive
drawing tablet. It allows you to adjust how sensitive the tool is based on
how hard you press down with the stylus.
Creating Paths without the Pen
I want to let you in on a fun way to create paths. Yes, I said fun. (You have to
assume that by fun I mean no Pen tool is involved in the method.)
You can grab any of the shape tools and create a work path. Before you do,
however, be sure to click the Paths icon on the Options bar. It’s the icon that
looks like a Pen cursor with a square path around it. Drag the shape tool of
choice on your canvas and presto, an instant path. These shapes can come
in handy for creating small spot illustrations, logos, and Web buttons.
Follow these steps:
1. Open an existing image and select a shape tool.
In the example shown in Figure 2-14, I used the Custom Shape tool.
2. Choose a shape from the shape preset library on the Options bar and
open an image.
I chose a fish shape.
3. Using the Shape tool, drag a path in your image window.
You can then use the Paths palette to load the path as a selection. (See
“Loading Paths as Selections,” earlier in this chapter.)
4. Choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy.
You’ve just put the selection on its own layer. You can hide your original
background image by clicking the eyeball icon in the Layers palette.
For more on layers, see Book V.

Figure 2-14: Using the Custom Shape tool is a fun and painless way to create paths.
5. If you want, add some type with the Type tool.
Then you can jazz it up — like this, for example:
• If you want to give your type some motion, click the Create Warped
Text button on the Options bar. You can also apply drop shadows,
bevels, and other effects by choosing Layer➪Layer Style.
• I chose the Flag style warp in the Warp Text dialog box.
• I also applied a Bevel and Emboss and Drop Shadow Layer Style to
both the selection and the type. (For more on type, see Book IV,
Chapter 3.)

When I was done, the image in Figure 2-15 was what I ended up with —
fun and very easy.
Figure 2-15: After adding some type and a few effects, you have a fun composite image.
Editing Paths
Often, it is easier and less time consuming to try to get a reasonably decent,
but not perfect path with the Pen tool. Then after you have that, go back
and edit your path for more accuracy. And while following the Eyeball-It-
Then-Fix-It strategy is valuable at any time in your Photoshop career, it’s
especially true when you’re first learning to use the Pen tool.
Photoshop offers you a bevy of editing tools that can make your path
repair a snap. These tools even share the same flyout menu as the Pen tool.
In addition, the arrow tools, which Adobe calls the Path Selection and Direct
Selection tools, are also extremely helpful when it comes to fine-tuning your
path. In fact, you may find (as I do) that the Direct Selection tool is one of
your favorite tools — so simple to use, yet so functional. Figure 2-16 shows
both sets of tools.
Book III
Chapter 2
Creating and
Working with Paths

Editing Paths
260
Figure 2-16: The compadres of the Pen tool help to refine your paths to perfection.
To edit a path, follow these steps:
1. If you can’t see the path you want to edit, select the path in the Paths
palette.
This activates the path.
2. To see the individual anchor points so that you can edit them, select
the Direct Selection tool (remember, it’s the white arrow). Click any-
where along the path.
You now see the individual anchor points and segments that comprise
the path. Most of the anchor points, if not all, are hollow because they
are unselected, as shown in Figure 2-17.
3. If you need to move an anchor point, click it with the Direct
Selection tool. When selected, the point becomes solid, also shown in

Editing Paths
261
Figure 2-17. Drag to move the
anchor point. If you need to, you
can move a curved or straight
segment in the same fashion.
4. If you’re in need of some major
repair and need to move an
entire path, use the Path
Selection tool (the black arrow).
You can also select multiple paths
by pressing the Shift key while
clicking the paths.
If you move any part of the path
beyond the boundary of the image
canvas, it is still available — just
not visible. Use the Zoom tool to
zoom out until you see the hidden
portion of the path.
5. Manipulate the direction lines to
change the shape of the curve. First, click the anchor point of the
curve to select it. Then click and drag the direction point going the
same direction as the bump.
By lengthening or shortening the
direction line, you can control how
steep or flat the curve is. By rotat-
ing the direction line, you change
the slope of the curve, as shown in
Figure 2-18.
• To add an anchor point in your
path, use the Add Anchor Point
tool. Click in the path where
you need an anchor point.
This tool always adds a smooth
point, no matter where you
click.
• To delete an anchor point,
select the Delete Anchor Point
tool, position the cursor over
the anchor point and click it.
The anchor point disappears while keeping your path intact.
• To convert an anchor point from smooth to corner or vice versa,
select the Convert Point tool. Position your cursor on your desired
anchor point. If the anchor point is a corner point, drag away from
the anchor point to create the direction lines that create a smooth
point. If the point is a smooth point, simply click and release on the

anchor point to convert it into a corner point. To convert a smooth
point to a cusp point, make sure the direction lines are showing and
then drag a direction line to break it into independent direction
lines. And finally, to convert a cusp point back to a smooth point,
just drag out from the anchor point.
• To copy a path, first select it with the Path Selection tool. Then press
Alt (Option on the Mac) and drag away from the path. As you drag,
you carry a copied path with you.
• To delete a path, select the path with the Path Selection tool and
press the Backspace key (Delete key on the Mac). You can also
select a point on the path with the Direct Selection tool and press
Backspace (Delete on the Mac) twice.
Using the Options Bar
Quite a few options appear on the Options bar when the Pen tool or Path
Selection/Direct Selection tools are active. Here is the scoop on those options:
 The Auto Add/Delete option enables you to add or delete an anchor
point with the regular Pen tool.
 Show Bounding Box places a box around the path, allowing you to
transform the path. The bounding box isn’t a path or part of your
image. It is merely a visual guide to assist you in transformations. You
can scale it by dragging the handles or rotate it by dragging just outside
the box. Press Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) and drag a handle or side to distort
or skew the path. For more on transformations, see Book III, Chapter 3.
 The path state buttons (Add, Subtract, Intersect, and Exclude) combine
all visible paths by adding, subtracting, intersecting, or excluding paths.
Click your desired button to direct Photoshop on how to control the
overlapping portions of the path(s) when you convert it to a selection.
For example, clicking the Add button selects all areas whether or not
they overlap. Clicking Intersect selects only the overlapping areas.
 The Combine button allows you to group paths together as a single unit.
Select your desired paths and click the Combine button. When you select
any one of the paths, all the paths within the group are selected as well.
 The Align and Distribute buttons align two or more paths and distrib-
ute three or more paths. The icons give you a good visual cue as to how
the alignment or distribution will appear.

f you’re like me, you may find it tough to get the perfect selec-
tion the first time around. I mean, all you need is one too
many cups of coffee, and that Lasso tool seems to take on
a mind of its own. That’s okay. Photoshop is way too
benevolent to leave you hanging with a mediocre
selection. A multitude of techniques are available to
modify and transform your selections. You can add
or remove pixels from your selection, scale your
selection outline, smooth out jagged edges, or
switch what is selected for what isn’t. Knowing
how to clean up and modify your selections helps
you to nail your desired element with precision.
If you haven’t already thumbed through the first two
chapters of Book III and gotten a good grasp of how to
create selections by using the mighty Photoshop Tools
palette, go ahead and browse those chapters now.
Achieving Selection Perfection
Although the selection tools, such as the Lasso, Quick Selection tool and
Magic Wand, usually do a pretty fair job at capturing the bulk of your selection,
making a really accurate selection often requires another sort of tool — 
concentration. Give your selections a little extra attention, and you’ll be

Achieving Selection Perfection
264
amazed by the results. By adding and subtracting from the outline here and
there, you can refine a selection and ensure that you capture only what you
really want — and nothing that you don’t.
The following few sections show you how to use keyboard shortcuts, along
with your mouse, to make perfect selections. If you’re not one for keyboard
shortcuts, you can use the four selection option buttons on the Options bar
to create a new selection, add to a selection, subtract from a selection, or
intersect one selection with another. All you need to do is grab the selection
tool of your choice, click the selection option button you want, and drag (or
click if you’re using the Magic Wand or Polygon Lasso tool).
When adding to a selection, a small plus sign (+) appears next to your
cursor. When subtracting from a selection, a small minus sign (–) appears.
When intersecting two selections, a small multiplication sign (×) appears.
Adding to a selection
If your selection doesn’t quite contain all the elements you want to capture,
you need to add those portions to your current selection.
For you keyboarders, to add to a current selection, simply press the Shift
key and drag around the pixels you want to include with the regular Lasso
or the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool. You can also press the Shift
key and click the area you want with the Magic Wand tool, or drag the area
you want with the Quick Selection tool. 
To include an area with straight sides in your selection, you can press the
Shift key and click around the area with the Polygon Lasso tool. And
although you may not have much need to do it, you can also press the Shift
key and click with the Single Column or Single Row Marquee tool. I wouldn’t
use the Magnetic Lasso tool to add to a selection; it’s way too cumbersome.
You don’t have to use the same tool to add to your selection that you used
to create the original selection. Feel free to use whatever selection tool you
think can get the job done. (See Book III, Chapters 1 and 2 for details on
selection tools and methods.)
Here are the steps to use for adding to a circular selection:
1. Make your initial elliptical selection. Select the larger circle with the
Elliptical Marquee tool. 
Be sure you press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) to draw from the
center out.
See the left image in Figure 3-1.

Achieving Selection Perfection
265
Figure 3-1: The original selection appears on the left, and the selection after adding is on 
the right.
2. To add the smaller circular area, first press the Shift key to add to the
selection, and then press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) to draw
from the center out.
3. Drag around the smaller selection with the Elliptical Marquee tool.
The resulting selection is shown in the example on the right in Figure 3-1.
Subtracting from a selection
Just as you can add to a selection marquee, you can also subtract, or take a
chunk out of a selection. To subtract from a current selection, press the Alt
key (Option on the Mac) and drag around the pixels you want to subtract
with the regular Lasso or the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool. 
Press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and click the area you want to remove
with the Magic Wand tool. 
To subtract a straight-sided area, press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and
click around the area with the Polygon Lasso tool.
You can press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and click with the Single
Column or Single Row Marquee tool. The Single Column and Row Marquee
tools come in handy when you want to get rid of just the very edge of a
selection.

266
In the left example of Figure 3-2, I first selected the frame with the Polygon
Lasso tool. I didn’t use the obvious tool of choice — the Rectangular Marquee
tool — because the frame was not completely straight. To deselect the inside
of the frame from the selection, I pressed the Alt key (Option on the Mac)
and clicked at each corner of the inside of the frame with the Polygon Lasso
tool, resulting in the selection shown in the right example of Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-2: Press the Alt (Option on the Mac) to delete from your existing selection.
Intersecting two selections
What happens when you press the Shift and Alt (Option on the Mac) keys
together? Not a collision, but an intersection. Pressing both keys while drag-
ging with the Lasso or Marquee tool or clicking with the Magic Wand tool
creates the intersection of the original selection with the second selection. 
To retain only the part of an image where two selections overlap, press Shift
and Alt (or Shift and Option on the Mac) and then drag.
You can select a portion of an image with a tool such as the Polygon Lasso
tool. Then press the Shift and Alt (Shift and Option on the Mac) keys at the
same time and drag with the Rectangular Marquee tool. The resulting inter-
section of the two selections appears.
Getting the Keys to Behave
Photoshop has a little glitch in its way of doing things. Well, not so much of a
glitch as a conflict. With so many ways of doing things with Photoshop, some-
where along the line you may have to jigger with Photoshop to get it to do
what you want. For example, how does Photoshop know whether you want to
create a perfect square or add to a selection when you press the Shift key?

Getting the Keys to Behave
267
Let me lay this out for you:
 When you make an initial selection with the Rectangular or Elliptical
Marquee tool, pressing the Shift key constrains the proportions of the
selection, thereby allowing you to create a perfect square or a perfect
circle. 
 If you press Alt (Option on the Mac) with either of these tools, you can
draw from the center out. 
 If you press Alt (Option on the Mac) with the Lasso tool, the Lasso tem-
porarily becomes the Polygon Lasso tool.
Unfortunately, despite numerous requests, the ability to read users’ minds
wasn’t a Version CS3 upgrade feature. The following sections show you what
you have to do to get Photoshop to recognize your wishes.
Adding a perfectly square or circular selection
To add a perfectly square or round selection to an existing selection, follow
these steps:
1. Press Shift and drag with the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool.
Your selection is unconstrained. 
2. As you drag, keeping your mouse button pressed, release the Shift
key for just a moment, and then press it again.
Your unconstrained selection suddenly snaps into a constrained square
or circle. 
3. Release the mouse button before you release the Shift key. 
If you don’t release the mouse button before you release the Shift key, the
selection shape reverts back to its unconstrained form.
Deleting from an existing selection 
while drawing from the center out
To delete part of a selection while drawing from the center out, follow these
steps:
1. Press Alt (Option on the Mac) and drag with the Rectangular or
Elliptical Marquee tool. 
2. As you drag, keeping your mouse button pressed, release the Alt
(Option on the Mac) key for just a moment, and then press it again. 
You are now drawing from the center outward.

Using the Select Menu
268
3. Release the mouse button before
you release the Alt (Option on
the Mac) key.
See Figure 3-3.
Use this technique when you’re select-
ing a doughnut, tire, inflatable swim
ring, and other circular items with
holes in the middle.
Using the Select Menu
Although you can add, subtract, and
intersect selections with the Shift
and Alt (Option on the Mac) keys and
the selection option buttons on the
Options bar, you can do much more
with the commands on the Select menu,
shown in Figure 3-4. Here you find ways
to expand, contract, smooth, fuzz, and
turn your selection inside out. You can
also use this menu to automatically select similar
colors and create selection borders. And I show
you how to do this in the next few sections. With
this kind of knowledge, imperfect selections will
soon be a thing of the past.
Selecting all or nothing
The Select All and Deselect commands are pretty
self-explanatory. To select everything in your
image, choose Select➪All. To deselect everything,
choose Select➪Deselect. The key commands
Ctrl+A (Ô+A on the Mac) and Ctrl+D (Ô+D on the
Mac), respectively, come in very handy and are easy
to remember. 
In most cases, you don’t have to select everything in your image. If you
don’t have an active selection marquee, Photoshop naturally assumes to
apply whatever command you execute to the entire image.
Reselecting a selection
If you have taken 20 minutes to carefully lasso a spiny sea anemone from 
its ocean home, the last thing you want is to lose your coveted selection

selection and drawing from the center out

canvas when you have an active selection tool in hand. The selection mar-
quee disappears.
Sure, you can choose Edit➪Undo if you catch your mistake right away. And
technically, you can access the History palette to recover your selection
(see Book II, Chapter 4 for more on history). A much easier solution is to
choose Select➪Reselect. This command retrieves your last selection. 
Besides immediately bringing back a selection you accidentally deselected,
the Reselect command can come in handy if you decide to select an element
again for a second time. For example, if you do such a great job retouching
your spiny anemone that you decide to add, by cloning, another anemone
to your image, go ahead. It’s all up to you. By using the Reselect command,
you can easily load the selection again rather than start the selection from
scratch.
The Reselect command only works for the last selection you made, so don’t
plan to reselect a selection you made last week — or even ten minutes ago —
if you’ve selected something else in the meantime.
Swapping a selection
Sometimes selecting what you don’t
want is easier than selecting what you
do want. For example, if you’re trying
to select your pet dog, photographed
against a neutral background, why
spend valuable time meticulously
selecting him with the Pen or Lasso
tool, when you can just click the back-
ground with the Magic Wand tool?
(Don’t forget to use the Shift key to
select bits of background you might
have missed the first time.) 
After you select the background, just
choose Select➪Inverse. Presto, you
now have Fido the Retriever selected
and obediently awaiting your next
command, as shown in Figure 3-5.
Feathering a selection
In Book III, Chapter 1, I described how
to feather (blur the edges) a selection
when using the Lasso and Marquee tools by entering a value in the Feather
box on the Options bar. This method of feathering requires that you set your
Feather radius before you create your selection.

Figure 3-5: Sometimes you want to select
what you don’t want and then inverse your
selection.

Unfortunately, using this method, a problem arises if you want to modify the
initial selection. When you make a selection with a feather, the marquee out-
line of the selection adjusts to take into account the amount of the feather.
That means that the resulting marquee outline doesn’t resemble your pre-
cise mouse movement. As a result, modifying, adding, or subtracting from
your original selection is pretty tough. 
A much better way to feather a selection is to make your initial selection
without a feather, as shown in the top image of Figure 3-6. Clean up your
selection as you need to, and then apply your feather by choosing Select➪
Modify➪Feather. (Yes, Photoshop CS3 moved the Feather command under
the Modify submenu.) Enter a Feather Radius value and click OK. The result-
ing selection appears in the bottom image of Figure 3-6.

feather.

The radius is how far out in all directions the feather extends. A radius of 8
means the feather extends 8 pixels to the right, left, up, and down from the
selection outline. A large feather radius makes the image appear to fade out.
Using the other Modify commands
In addition to the Feather command, the Select Modify menu contains a
group of other modification commands that are lumped categorically. With
the exception of the Contract command, you probably won’t use these
options every day. But when you do use them, you’ll find they prove pretty
handy. Here is the lowdown on each command:
 Border: This command selects the
area around the edge of the selec-
tion marquee. You specify the
width of the area, from 1 to 200
pixels, and you get a border mar-
quee, like the top image in Figure
3-7. Choose a foreground color,
choose Edit➪Fill, pick Foreground
Color from the Use drop-down list,
and then click OK to fill your
border with color, as shown in the
bottom image in Figure 3-7. By the
way, you can also achieve a similar
look by choosing Edit➪Stroke.
As you can see in Figure 3-7, the
Border command creates an anti-
aliased (or soft-edged) selection. 
 Smooth: If your selection marquee
seems a bit ragged around the
edges, try selecting the Smooth command to round off the nooks and

Deleting a straight-sided selection
If you have an existing selection, pressing Alt
(Option on the Mac) with the Lasso tool sub-
tracts from the selection. If you want to subtract
a straight-sided selection from an existing
selection, you can press Alt (Option on the Mac)
and begin to drag. Then quickly release Alt
(Option on the Mac) and then select the Polygon
Lasso tool. But this can be tricky and is really
unnecessary. I recommend just grabbing the
Polygon Lasso tool itself to delete your straight-
sided selection. Ditto for adding and getting
intersections with straight-sided selections.

a marquee from .2 to 250 pixels wide,
which you can then fill with color.

crannies. Enter a sample radius value from 1 to 100 pixels. Photoshop
examines each selected pixel and then includes or de-selects pixels in
your selection based on the range specified by the radius amount. If
most of the pixels are selected, Photoshop includes the strays; if most
of the pixels are unselected, Photoshop removes the pixels. Start with 
2 pixels — and if that doesn’t seem like enough, increase it by a few
more pixels or so.
Use this command with great caution. It’s just too easy to get mushy, ill-
defined selections.
 Expand: This command allows you to increase the size of your selec-
tion by a specified number of pixels, from 1 to 100. This command can
come in handy if you just missed the edge of a circular selection and
want to enlarge it, as shown in Figure 3-8.
 Contract: To shrink your selection by 1 to 100 pixels, choose Contract. I
use this command a lot, in conjunction with the Feather command,
when compositing multiple images.
 Feather: This command, now lumped with its brethren under the
Modify submenu, is described in detail in the previous section.
Figure 3-8: The Expand command increases your selection, enabling you to pick up missed
pixels around the edges.
After you make a selection, contract it and then feather it before you drag it
onto the canvas. This technique helps to create a nice, natural-looking tran-
sition between the various images in your composite. The amount you
decide to contract and feather varies according to the resolution of your
images. For example, if you’re using low-resolution (72 dpi) images, you may
want to use 1 pixel for the Contract amount and 0.5 pixels for the Feather

Moving and Cloning Selections
273
amount; higher resolution images may warrant 2 to 3 pixels for the Contract
amount and 1 to 2 pixels for the Feather amount. (For more on compositing
images, see Book V on layers.)
Applying the Grow and Similar commands
The Grow and Similar commands are close cousins to the Magic Wand tool.
(For more on the Wand and Tolerance, check out Book III, Chapter 1.) If
you’re familiar with the modus operandi of the Magic Wand tool, you know
that you rarely get the perfect selection on the first click. That’s because
you are making an intelligent guess as to what Tolerance setting picks up
the pixels you want.
The Grow command compensates a little for the Magic Wand tool’s inaccu-
racy. For example, if you need to include more in your selection, you can
increase the Tolerance setting and try again — press Shift and click the area
you need to include. Or you can choose Select➪Grow. The Grow command
increases the size of the selection by including adjacent pixels that fall
within the range of Tolerance. 
The Similar command is like Grow, only the pixels don’t have to be adjacent
to be selected. The command searches throughout the image and picks up
pixels within the Tolerance range, wherever they may fall.
Both commands use the Tolerance value that is displayed on the Options
bar when you have the Magic Wand tool selected. Adjust the Tolerance set-
ting to include more or fewer colors by increasing or decreasing the setting,
respectively.
The new Refine Edge command helps to fine tune your selection. Find out
details in Book III, Chapter 1 under the “Marquee Options” section.
Moving and Cloning Selections
When you have your selection refined to ultimate perfection, you may then
want to move it or clone it. To move a selection, simply grab the Move tool
(the four-headed arrow) at the top right of the Tools palette, and then drag
the selection. 
Sounds easy enough, right? When you move the selection, however, be
warned that the area where the selection used to reside is now filled with
the background color, as shown in Figure 3-9. This is provided, of course,
that you are moving both the selection outline and the image pixels. You can
move just the selection outline (without the pixels), as I explain in an
upcoming section. Also note that if you are moving a selection on a layer,
Book III
Chapter 3
Modifying and
Transforming
Selections and Paths

Moving and Cloning Selections
274
you are left with transparent pixels.
When you use the Move tool, your
cursor icon changes to a pair of scis-
sors, letting you know that you are cut-
ting out the selection.
The Move tool has a couple of notable
options residing in the Options bar:
 Auto-Select Layer: Select the top-
most layer directly under the
Move tool cursor, not necessarily
the selected area.
 Auto-Select Group: Select the entire layer group that the selected layer
belongs to.
 Show Transform Controls: Shows handles on the bounding box of your
selected area.
Cloning
If the idea of leaving a big hole in your
image doesn’t appeal to you, you can
copy and move the selection, leaving
the original image intact, as shown in
Figure 3-10. Just press Alt (Option on
the Mac) and drag with the Move tool.
This action is often referred to as
cloning because you’re essentially
making a duplicate of a selected area
and then moving that duplicate else-
where. 
When cloning, your cursor icon
changes to a double-headed arrow,
notifying you that you are duplicating
the selection. If you want to move your selection in small increments (1 pixel
at a time), press your arrow keys while you have the Move tool selected.
Press Shift along with an arrow key to move 10 pixels. And of course, adding
the Alt (Option on the Mac) key to the key commands allows you to clone a
selection while you move it.
You can temporarily access the Move tool by pressing the Ctrl (Ô on the
Mac) key when you have any tool selected, except for the Hand tool, pen
tools, slice tools, Path Selection tool, Direct Selection tool, and shape tools.
Likewise, press Alt (Option) along with Ctrl (Ô) with any of these tools to
clone and move a selection.
Figure 3-9: When moving a selection with
the Move tool, you leave a hole that reveals
the background color.
Figure 3-10: Press the Alt (Option on the
Mac) to clone your selection and not leave
a nasty hole.

Transforming Pixels
275
Moving the selection outline, but not the pixels
If all you want to do is move the selection marquee without moving the pixels
underneath, you want to avoid using the Move tool. Instead, grab any selec-
tion tool — the marquee tools, the lasso tools, or the Magic Wand tool — and
then click inside the marquee and just drag. That way you move only the out-
line of the element, not the element itself. You can also use the arrow keys to
nudge a selection marquee.
You can move and clone selections within a single image or among multiple
images. To move a selection from one image to another, choose Edit➪Cut,
activate the second image, and choose Edit➪Paste. To clone a selection,
simply drag the selection with the Move tool from one image window and
drop it onto another image window. 
Transforming Pixels
After you perfectly select your element, you may find you need to resize or
reorient that element. Transforming involves the scaling, rotating, skewing,
distorting, warping, flipping, or adjusting of the perspective of your pixels.
Although you may consider the distortions on the Transform menu some-
what mundane when compared to the fun and flashy Liquify command
(which I describe in Book VII, Chapter 3), I’m sure you’ll find them a lot more
practical and useful in your daily digital-imaging chores.
Here’s how to transform a selection:
1. Create your selection.
I’ll leave this task up to you; just use your now well-honed selection
expertise.
You can also apply transformations to a layer or to multiple layers (for
more on this topic, see Book V).
2. Choose Edit➪Transform.
If all you want is a single transformation, this command is adequate.
However, if you want multiple transformations, you’re wise to stick with
the Free Transform command, which I cover later in this section.
3. Choose a transformation type from the submenu, as shown in 
Figure 3-11:
• Scale: Increases or decreases the size of your selection
• Rotate: Freely rotates your selection in either direction
• Skew: Distorts your selection on a given axis
• Distort: Distorts your selection with no restrictions on an axis
Book III

Transforming Pixels
276
• Perspective: Applies a one-
point perspective to your
selection
• Warp: This option is like a
mini-Liquify command where
you can distort your selection
by manipulating a mesh grid
that overlays on your image
• Rotate 180°, 90° CW
(Clockwise), or 90° CCW
(Counterclockwise): Rotates
the selection by specified
amounts
• Flip Horizontal or Vertical:
Flips your selection along the
vertical and horizontal axes,
respectively
As soon as you select your desired
distortion and release the mouse
button, a box called the bounding
box, or transform box, surrounds
your selection, complete with han-
dles on the sides and corners.
Note that you don’t get a bounding
box with the Flip transformation
(which just gets applied to your
image).
4. Depending on which transformation type you chose in Step 3, drag a
handle.
• Scale: Corner handles work best for this transformation. Press Shift
to scale proportionately. Press Alt (Option on the Mac) to scale from
the center.
• Rotate: Move your cursor outside the bounding box. When the
cursor becomes a curved arrow, drag CW or CCW. Press Shift to
rotate in 15-degree increments.
• Skew: Drag a side handle.
• Distort: Drag a corner handle.
• Perspective: Drag a corner handle.
• Warp: Drag any control point or line on the default custom mesh
grid to distort your selection. In fact, you can pretty much drag 
Figure 3-11: The Transform submenu
offers a variety of transformation options.

Transforming Pixels
277
anywhere on the image, even in between mesh lines, to apply the
warp. You cannot, however, add or delete control points. 
With the Warp transformation you have some additional options. On the
Options bar, you find a drop-down menu with various warping styles such
as arch, wave, and twist. In fact, these are the same styles you find on the
Warp Text menu (see Book IV, Chapter 3). When you choose one 
of the styles, Photoshop then applies the mesh grid for that style. Here is
the lowdown on the remaining options:
• Change the warp orientation: Change the direction of some styles,
such as wave, flag, and fish.
• Bend: Increase the value to increase the distortion.
• H% and V%: Increase the percentages to increase the Horizontal (H)
and Vertical (V) distortions.
• High Quality: Keep this option checked to enable Photoshop to use
a more detailed and complex algorithm when interpolating image
data.
• Switch between free transform and warp mode: Click this button
to switch between the Free Transform box and the Warp mesh grid.
Choosing Rotate 180°, 90° CW, or 90° CCW or Flip Horizontal or Vertical
just executes the command. Handle-dragging isn’t necessary.
Photoshop executes all the transformations, except warp, around a
point called the reference point. The reference point appears in the
center of the transform box by default.
You can move the center point anywhere you want, even outside the
bounding box. In addition, you can set your own reference point for 
the transformation by clicking a square on the reference point locator
on the Options bar. Each square corresponds with a point on the bound-
ing box.
5. You can choose a second transformation type from the Edit➪Transform
submenu, if desired.
If you’re an ultraprecise type of person, you can also numerically trans-
form the selection by entering values on the Options bar. 
In Figure 3-12, I executed all the transformations at the same time.
Be sure to execute all your transformations in one fell swoop if possible.
In other words, don’t scale a selection now and then five minutes later
rotate it and then five minutes later distort it, because every time you
apply a transformation to an image, you are putting it through an inter-
polation process. You want to limit how many times you interpolate an

image because it has a degrading effect — your image starts to appear
soft and mushy. Only flipping or rotating in 90-degree increments is
interpolation free. For more on interpolation, see Book II, Chapter 1.
Figure 3-12: Apply all transformations at once to minimize interpolation.
6. After you transform your selection to your liking, do one of the fol-
lowing: Double-click inside the bounding box; click the Commit
button on the Options bar; or press Enter (Return on the Mac).
To cancel the transformation, press Esc or click the Cancel button on
the Options bar.
Your image is now magically transformed. Note that if your image isn’t
on a layer, you can leave a hole filled with the background color after
your image is transformed. Check out Book V to avoid this calamity.
To repeat a transformation, choose Edit➪Transform➪Again.
Transforming Selection Marquees
To transform just the selection marquee — without affecting the under-
lying pixels — make your desired selection and then choose Select➪
Transform Selection. Photoshop doesn’t have a submenu with individual
transformations to choose from. Instead, you must apply the transformations
like you do with the Free Transform command: by using the keyboard

shortcuts. You can also enter values on
the Options bar to transform numeri-
cally, or you can access the context
menu. To move the selection marquee
and the bounding box, simply drag
inside the marquee or nudge it by using
the keyboard arrow keys. Transforming
selections is particularly handy when
you’re trying to select elliptical objects.
Getting a precise selection the first time
around is often hard, so applying a
transformation is often necessary. For
example, in Figure 3-13, I scaled,
rotated, and distorted the marquee
around my clock to get a more accurate
selection.
Transforming Paths
After the bounding box is around the path, the transformation technique for
paths is the same as it is for selections and selection marquees, except that
you can apply the distort, perspective, and warp commands only to whole
paths. The major difference between transforming paths and selections is in
how you first select the path.
Book III
Chapter 3
Modifying and
Transforming
Selections and Paths
Figure 3-13: You can easily transform a
selection marquee without affecting
underlying pixels.
Distorting selected pixels with Free Transform
The Transform menu isn’t the only way to distort
selected pixels. A much more efficient way is to
use the Free Transform command, also on the
Edit menu. Like the Transform command, the Free
Transform command surrounds your selection
with a bounding box. Within the bounding box,
you can scale, rotate, skew, distort, or apply per-
spective without having to choose the individual
distortions. You just have to use the right key-
board shortcuts. To scale and rotate, use the
same method as the Transform commands.
Here’s the scoop on the rest:
 Skew: Ctrl+Shift+drag (Ô+Shift+drag on
the Mac) on a side handle.
 Distort: Ctrl+drag (Ô+drag on the Mac) on
any handle.
 Perspective: Ctrl+Shift+Alt+drag (Ô+Shift+
Option+drag on the Mac) on a corner handle.
Unfortunately, if you want to rotate by degree
while free-transforming, you need to enter the
numeric values of your desired rotation on the
Options bar.

Putting It Together
Removing a Person (Without Getting in Trouble with the Law)
Sometimes you may want to take an element out of a picture so that you can maintain the
viewer’s focus on something else. Or maybe you just don’t want the element in the image.
But remember, if you simply delete an unwanted element without cloning, you leave a
huge space (colored with the background color) where the element was. Not smooth.
In the following steps, I show you how to seamlessly remove an unwanted element (in
this case, a person) from an image.
When you first attempt this technique, start with an image that has an element that isn’t
physically attached to something that you want to keep in the image.
1. Open an image that contains something that you want to remove.
2. Use the selection tool of your choice to select the element that you want to
remove.
In this step, you’re creating a selection marquee that you use to clone another area
of the image.
You don’t have to be super-precise, so feel free to grab the Lasso tool. If you need a
Lasso refresher, see Book III, Chapter 1. When you make your selection, be careful
not to cut off any portion of your element. Otherwise you leave some stray pixels —
a dead giveaway that something was once there. Using the Lasso tool, I made a
rough outline around the little boy, as shown in the following figure.

3. Position your cursor inside the selection marquee, press the mouse button and
then the Shift key, and drag your selection to move it horizontally (or vertically if
the image warrants it) to an area of the photo that you want to clone.
Notice how the selection marquee, shown in the following figure, is the only thing
that I moved.
4. With the Move tool selected, position your cursor inside the selection marquee,
press Alt+Shift (Option+Shift on the Mac), and then drag to move the cloned area on
top of the element that you’re removing. Carefully match up the edges, release your
mouse button, and then release the Alt and Shift keys (Option and Shift on the Mac).
5. Choose Select➪Deselect.
The cloned area now covers the element that you want to remove, as shown in the
following figure. In the example, the beach/ocean selection now covers the little boy.
Depending on your image, you may want to choose Select➪Modify➪Feather and
enter 1 or 2 pixels before you move the cloned area. Doing this softens the edges
and smoothes out the transition between the cloned area and the background. (See
the section, “Feathering a selection,” in this chapter for more on feathering.) I didn’t
feather my selection because it didn’t really need it. Try it both ways to see which
looks better. Use the History palette to undo your steps, if necessary (see Book II,
Chapter 4 for more on the History palette).
The final step is to clean up any telltale signs that the element was there.
6. Choose the Clone Stamp tool and select a medium-size feathered brush from the
Brush Preset picker on the Options bar or the Brushes palette, press Alt (Option on
the Mac), and click a good area next to a flaw; release Alt (Option) and then click
the flaw.
Area to be cloned

If the Clone Stamp is a mystery to you, be sure to check out Book VIII, Chapter 3.
Repeat this step until you fix all the flaws and the clone blends in seamlessly with
the background. Don’t get carried away with the Clone Stamp tool, or you end up
with a smudgy mess. Being light-handed is a good thing, as I was in the now
retouched image. Nobody can tell that only one man stands where two people 
once stood.

L
ike a Swiss Army knife, Photoshop does it all.
This book describes all you need to know
about Photoshop’s drawing and painting tools.
I ﬁrst give you the lowdown on the ubiquitous
brush. The brush — which is found not only in the
Brush tool itself, but within several other painting
and editing tools — has more variations than you
can shake a stick at. I also cover how to create
vector shapes with the Shape tools and how to ﬁll
and stroke your selections with color. If one color
is not enough, keep reading until you get to the
section on gradients and patterns. I give you the
steps for using the many Photoshop presets and
also for creating your own gradients and patterns.
And because man doesn’t communicate by images
alone, you can ﬁnd lots of useful information about
creating type. Not just regular old run-of-the-mill
type, mind you (which is covered of course), but
type on a path, type with shadows and bevels, type
ﬁlled with images, type warped into shapes — you
get the . . . um . . . picture.

Chapter 1: Painting and 
Drawing with Photoshop
In This Chapter
 Making pencil sketches and brush strokes
 Using Brush presets
 Managing brushes with the Brushes palette
 Understanding vectors
 Creating basic and custom shapes
 Setting geometry options
You’re definitely going to want to brush up on your painting and drawing
techniques now that you don’t have to worry about messing
up your clothes. Painting is one of the basic skills you need to
work in Photoshop. After you master the art of painting
strokes and working with brushes, you’re well on your
way to mastering more advanced techniques, such as
masking and retouching, which benefit from strong
painting skills. (I introduce the full range of Brush
tools in Book I, Chapter 2.)
Going hand in hand with painting, of course, is
drawing. Photoshop’s shape tools add an important
dimension to your drawing capabilities. This chapter
introduces you to a plethora of tools and techniques.
I start with painting and then move on to drawing.
Embrace both and they can serve you well.
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
The Pencil and Brush tools are like peanut butter and chocolate. Not only do
they work well together, but they also share many important traits. Just as
important, however, are their differences. You can access these tools in the
Tools palette. Press B, and the Brush tool appears by default. To access the
Pencil, press Shift+B. You can toggle between the tools by pressing Shift+B
again. Find out more about using these tools in the following sections.

Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
288
Finding out what the Pencil tool does
The Pencil and Brush tools are very much alike, except that the Pencil tool
has hard edges by default (as shown in Figure 1-1) and the Brush tool can
have soft, feathered edges. The Pencil tool can also erase what it creates!
Figure 1-1: The Pencil tool draws hard-edged strokes and is 
perfect for digital sketches.
You can do all the following with the Pencil tool:
 Drag the mouse to draw freehand lines.
 Click at one point, release the mouse button, and then Shift+click at a
second point to draw a straight line between the points. As long as you
keep the Shift key depressed, you can keep clicking to draw straight
lines between each of the points.
 Press the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) and click in any area of
your drawing to switch the foreground color to that hue.
The Pencil tool also offers the Auto Erase option, which you activate from
the Options bar at the top. Auto Erase is a handy feature that lets you
remove portions of your pencil strokes without switching to the Eraser tool.
When you have Auto Erase turned on, the operation of the Pencil tool is
slightly different from the default. The effect of either of the following
actions is that Photoshop erases lines you’ve drawn:

Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
289
 When you click in any area of the drawing other than an area that is
foreground colored (for example, the pencil lines you’ve already drawn),
the Pencil tool begins drawing a line in the foreground color (this is the
default mode).
 When you click in any area of the drawing that is foreground colored
(such as the pencil lines you’ve drawn), the Pencil tool draws by using
the background color.
Because the Pencil tool doesn’t use
soft-edged lines to draw, anything other
than straight vertical or horizontal lines
has rough, jagged edges, as shown in
the close-up image in Figure 1-2. Jaggies
aren’t objectionable in some cases,
especially in higher-resolution images,
but if you zoom in on an area containing
pencil lines, the jaggies are readily
apparent. I show you how to modify the
characteristics of the lines drawn with
the Pencil tool later in this chapter in
“Working with the Brushes palette.”
Using the Pencil tool
If you’re ready to start using the Pencil tool, keep in mind that lines that
aren’t vertical or horizontal look jagged up close. But this doesn’t necessar-
ily pose a problem in all cases, especially when working with Web graphics.
Those same hard edges can lend themselves to producing crisp-edged
images for display in a browser window. To try out the Pencil tool, work
your way through these steps:
1. Activate the Pencil tool by choosing it from the Tools palette. (It
shares a flyout menu with the Brush tool.)
You can press Shift+B to make it appear if it’s hidden underneath the

The Pencil tool’s current brush tip (usually the 1-pixel brush unless you
select something else) is shown in the Brush Preset picker on the
Options bar.
Click the arrow in the Brush box to summon the Brush Preset picker
palette if you want to choose a different-size pencil tip.
2. If you want to draw using anything other than Normal mode, choose a
mode from the Mode options menu.
Modes other than Normal cause colors to interact and blend in different
ways. (You can find more about modes in Book V, Chapter 3.)

If you want whatever is in the background to show partially through
your strokes, choose an opacity of less than 100 percent by using the
slider or by typing an opacity percentage directly into the text box.
4. Click and drag with the mouse to create your pencil lines.
Painting with the Brush tool
The Brush tool is a basic tool used throughout Photoshop in various incar-
nations, so you’ll want to master its use as quickly as possible.
The most important difference between the Brush and the Pencil tools is
that, by default, the Brush tool produces soft-edged lines that Photoshop
renders smoother by a process known as anti-aliasing. This technique sub-
stitutes partially filled pixels along the edges of lines to produce the illusion
of gradual fading. Our eyes merge the transparent pixels together, so the
line looks smooth rather than hard-edged.
Although jaggy edges are most appar-
ent in diagonal lines, Photoshop
applies anti-aliasing to brush stroke
edges even in horizontal and vertical
lines. The fuzzier the brush, the more
semi-filled pixels used to produce the
effect, as you can see in Figure 1-3.
The Brush tool shares most of the
basic features found in the Pencil tool,
except the Auto Erase feature is not
available:
 Activate the Brush tool from the
Tools palette or by pressing B (or
Shift+B if you used the Pencil tool
last).
 Choose a brush tip from the Brush
Preset picker on the Options bar.
 Select a mode and opacity from the options on the Options bar.
 Drag to paint, click and Shift+click to paint straight lines, and press the
Shift key while dragging to constrain the Brush tool to horizontal or ver-
tical lines.
 Press the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) and click in any area of
color to switch the foreground color to that color.

The Brush tool has several other options to select from:
 Flow: Flow determines how quickly the Brush
tool applies the paint. You can set a flow rate
from 1 to 100 percent by using the Flow slider
or by typing a percentage directly into the
text box. You might think of it as controlling
how wet or liquid the paint is. At low flow
rates, Photoshop applies the paint slowly so
the color is not as intense; at higher flow
rates, the paint quickly reaches its full
strength as you drag.
 Airbrush: Click the Airbrush button on the
Options bar to switch the Brush tool (as well
as many of the other tools that use brush
tips) to Airbrush mode. This mode produces
the spray effect you get with a traditional air-
brush. The longer you hold down the mouse
button, the more paint that pumps out of the
tool, and the wider the airbrush effect
spreads, as shown in Figure 1-4.
 Toggle the Brushes Palette: At the far right of the Options bar is a
button (a palette icon) that shows or hides the Brushes palette. It’s a
quick way to access this valuable palette, and is also available with the
Pencil tool and other tools that use brush tips. I show you how to use
the Brushes palette in the next section.
Working with the Brushes palette
You’ll find the Brushes palette extremely useful for changing the characteris-
tics of preset brush tips and for creating your own. You can also access and
select brush presets, as I discuss later in this chapter.
You can view the Brushes palette in several ways:
 Choose Window➪Brushes from the menu bar.
 Click the Brushes palette icon in the Dock.
 Toggle the Brushes palette button on the right side of the Options bar.
 Press F5 to toggle the Brushes palette open or closed.
 Grab the Brushes palette’s icon and drag it out of the Dock and onto
your Photoshop desktop. This mode keeps the Brushes palette visible
until you put it away by dragging it back to the Dock, clicking its Close
box, or rendering it hidden with Window➪Brushes.

The Brushes palette displays a list of brush properties on the left and
includes a brush-stroke preview at the bottom of the palette.
The largest pane in the dialog box is the upper-right area that shows vari-
ous types of information, such as the size and type of brush tip, or the dif-
ferent controls offered for any of the twelve different properties you can set.
Click the Brush Presets label in the upper-left. The various preset previews
appear in the right panel.
Choosing a brush-tip shape
When you have Brush Tip Shape
selected in the left column of the
Brushes palette, a scrolling box shows
the available brush tips, as shown in
Figure 1-5. You can use the palette pop-
up menu to choose various views,
including text only, small and large
thumbnails, small and large lists, and
stroke thumbnail. (To access the pop-
up menu, click the triangle in the
upper-right of the palette.)
The twelve brush parameters you can
choose to apply and edit are arrayed
in the left column. You can select any
of these options to apply them to the
currently selected brush. Select an
option to edit its characteristics. Note
that you must select the parameter
name to access the options. Toggling
the parameter on by checking the
check box doesn’t work. Here are the
characteristics for Brush Tip Shape:
 Shape Dynamics: These controls include the amount of jitter (random-
ness or variation) produced when you draw a stroke, amount of fade,
the size, the jitter angle, the roundness, and other options. The higher
the value, the greater the amount of variance for each option. Some of
these apply only when you are using a pressure-sensitive digital tablet.
Check your digital tablet’s instruction manual for more information on
how to customize brushes for your tablet. The Flip X and Flip Y jitter
option flips the brush shape across the horizontal axis (X) or the verti-
cal axis (Y). For example, if your brush shape is an L shape and you
Figure 1-5: The Brushes palette offers a
multitude of different brush tips.

Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
293
select Flip X, your brush shape is a backwards L. Check Flip Y and your
brush shape is an upside down L shape. Check both and it’s an upside-
down, backwards L shape. 
 Scattering: This parameter controls the number and position of brush
marks in a stroke. The higher the value, the higher the number of brush
marks and the farther apart they are. When you have Both Axes selected,
Photoshop distributes the brush marks radially, as if on a curve. The
Count controls the number of brush marks at each spacing point. The
higher the value, the greater the number of marks.
 Texture: This control allows you to impart a texture pattern (using the
foreground color) to a brush stroke, either one of Photoshop’s preset tex-
tures or one of your design. Select Invert to reverse the light and dark
pixels in the pattern. Scale sizes the pattern in each stroke. Texture Each
Tip renders each tip as it is stroked, giving a more saturated effect. Depth
controls how prominent the pattern appears against the brush stroke.
Minimum Depth specifies the minimum depth that the paint of each
stroke shows through the pattern. Mode lets you choose one of Photo-
shop’s blending modes, as I describe in Book V, Chapter 3. You can find
more about creating and working with patterns in Book III, Chapter 3.
 Dual Brush: You can use two tips to draw with a single brush. This
option lets you select the characteristics of the second tip by using the
same type of attributes — such as diameter, spacing, and scatter —
applied to the first tip. You can also specify a blending mode between
the two tips.
 Color Dynamics: This control uses your foreground and background
colors to adjust how the color varies during a stroke, allowing you to
create a multicolored brush. Slight variations give the stroke a more nat-
ural, organic look. You can introduce slight (or major) jitter to the hue,
saturation, brightness, and purity of the colors, as well as some random-
ness between the foreground and background colors as you draw a
stroke. Without color dynamics, the stroke color remains constant.
 Other Dynamics: These introduce randomness into the opacity and
flow factors of a brush, again making the brush stroke look more natural
and less machine-generated. You’ll want to experiment with all the
dynamics to see exactly how they can affect your image. Note that the
Flow and Opacity settings in the Brushes palette do not override those
settings on the Options bar.
Here’s a list of brush-tip characteristics, which you also find on the left side
of the Brushes palette:
 Noise: Adds random pixels to brush tips, giving them texture and an
organic quality. This option is more apparent in feathered brushes.
 Wet Edges: The brush tip leaves a stroke that looks more like water-
color, with paint building up along the edges.
Book IV
Chapter 1

294
 Airbrush: Gives the brush tip a soft, airbrushed look.
 Smoothing: Smoothes out the curves when drawing arcs with the
brush. Again, this option is more noticeable when you use a pressure-
sensitive drawing tablet.
 Protect Texture: Ensures that all brush tips that use a texture use the
same texture. This allows you to switch back and forth between brush
tips while painting and still achieve a consistent texture.
Figure 1-6 shows the range of possibilities these options offer.
Figure 1-6: The brushes you can create are as varied as your imagination.

You can lock any of the brush characteristics by clicking the small lock icon
to the right of the characteristic. This ensures that the settings don’t change
after you have your brush just so. This works especially well if you want the
size of your brush to be correlated with the amount of pressure you apply to
a stylus when using a drawing tablet. By locking settings, you override any
specifications set by preset brushes. You can choose the Reset All Locked
Settings option from the Brushes palette pop-up menu to bring back the
default settings of the brush. And finally, to clear all brush options, select
Clear Brush Controls from the Brushes palette pop-up menu.
If you really like a brush you’ve created, feel free to save it as a preset that
you can access again and again. Simply choose New Brush Preset from the
pop-up menu on the Brushes palette or from the Brushes drop-down palette
on the Options bar.
Using the preset brushes
Photoshop has two brush palettes, in a sense. In addition to the Brushes
palette, there is the Brush Preset picker, shown in Figure 1-7. It is tucked
away on the Options bar and appears when you click the down-pointing tri-
angle next to the box that displays the currently active brush tip.
Figure 1-7: The Brush Preset picker offers a mini Brushes palette for quick and 
simplified access to brush tips.
Book IV
Chapter 1

Photoshop has a large number of predesigned brush presets that you can
use. The default set includes six round, hard-edged brushes (which still
have softer edges than the Pencil tool) and a group of twelve round soft-
edged brushes. There are also airbrush, spatter, and natural media brush
tip presets, as well as a group of brush tip shapes such as stars, leaves, and
other shapes. Photoshop CS3 has even more brush libraries, and you can
download brushes galore from the Web, so go crazy.
A preset brush’s pixel diameters are shown as text below a thumbnail image
of the brush shape when the palette’s display is in default mode. To use one
of these brush tips, just click the Brush Preset picker arrow on the Options
bar and choose the tip you want from the scrolling preset list. You can aug-
ment your choices with any of the following options:
 Move the Master Diameter slider to change the diameter of the selected
brush. This is a quick way of getting a slightly larger or smaller brush
when none of the presets meet your needs exactly. For example, the
largest hard-edged brush preset is 19 pixels in diameter. You can click
this brush tip and move the slider to the right to get a hard-edged brush
in any size up to 2500 pixels.
To change the brush size from the keyboard when a tool is active, press
the ] key (the right bracket) to increase the size and the [ key (the left
bracket) to decrease the size. The amount of change varies according to
the initial size of the brush. To adjust the size more dramatically, con-
tinue to press the bracket key.
 Choose the Use Sample Size option (available with certain brushes) to
get brush strokes of equal size. Depending on the size settings in your
Shape Dynamics characteristics, when you use a scatter brush, such as
a fish or flower, you get random variations in sizes. Select the Use Sample
Size option before you use the brush to get a consistent-size stroke
every time (based on a preset sample size). Note that you must select
the option each time you use the brush and you must also click, not
drag, the brush for each individual stroke to be equally sized. 
 Choose any of the libraries of additional brush-tip presets provided
with Photoshop. Click the Brush Preset picker’s pop-up menu and
choose one of the other brush libraries shown at the bottom. They
have names like Special Effect Brushes and Faux Finish Brushes. Select
one to append the brushes to your current set or to replace the current
set with the library you select (a dialog box appears that offers a choice
of either action).
You can also manage brush-tip libraries by using the Preset Manager.
(See Book I, Chapter 5 for information on using the Preset Manager.)

Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
297
 Select your own custom library of brush tips that you’ve created. Click
Load Brushes to append new brushes to your current collection or to
replace them with the new library.
 If the Hardness option is available, adjust the slider to make the brush
more (higher) or less (lower) fuzzy.
In addition to the presets Photoshop offers, you can create your own pre-
sets to use when you need them. Book I, Chapter 2 explains how to create
your own presets.
Viewing preset brushes
You can change the way brushes are shown in the Brushes Preset picker
and Brushes palette by choosing a viewing mode from the picker’s or
palette’s pop-up menus:
 Text Only: This displays the names of the brush tips in several columns
(depending on how wide you’ve made the pop-up palette).
 Small Thumbnail: This is the default view, with a thumbnail image of
the brush tip and its diameter in pixels.
 Large Thumbnail: This view provides a closer look at the brush tip.
 Small List: This view shows a single-column list of the brush tips with
their text names.
 Large List: The larger list adds thumbnails so you can see the brush
shape.
 Stroke Thumbnail: This view shows a typical stroke by using the
selected brush so you can see how it looks when applied.

Putting It Together
Colorizing Black-and-White Images
Just as there are valid artistic reasons for shooting a photo in black and white, there are
equally reasonable rationales for changing a grayscale image into a color one. Perhaps
the picture is an old one, taken before color film was widely used, and you’d like to col-
orize it. Or you may come across a monochrome image that would look even better in
color. Photoshop lets you restore black-and-white pictures to their original colors or
create whole new color schemes. If you can imagine an image in color, use Photoshop to
add the hues you want to see.

In my example, which you can find on this book’s Web site (see the Introduction for
details), I chose a black-and-white photo of an adorable boy. Instead of a full-color treat-
ment that attempts to duplicate a color photograph, I want to apply a technique that
mimics the hand-colored look of the venerable Marshall’s Photo Coloring System of pig-
ments, photo oils, spot colors, retouch pencils, and other products so popular in the ’50s
and ’60s (and enjoying a rebirth today). Although I’ve worked with a Marshall’s kit myself,
Photoshop is a lot faster, easier, and way less messy.
1. Open a grayscale image in Photoshop.
2. Choose Image➪Mode➪RGB Color to convert the grayscale image to a full-color
image (even though it presently still lacks any color).
3. Choose Layer➪New ➪Layer.
This creates a new transparent layer to paint on. Although you can paint directly on
an image layer (or a copy of an image layer), using an empty layer is safer — and
gives you more flexibility in backtracking when you make a mistake. (For more infor-
mation on working with layers, consult Book V.)

4. In the New Layer dialog box that appears, name the layer and then click OK.
You can paint all your colors on a single layer, but you may find that using a separate
layer for each part of the face lets you fade that color in and out as required to
blend smoothly with your other hues.
5. Select the Color mode from the Blend
Mode drop-down list in the Layers
palette, shown in the figure.
Photoshop uses this mode to combine
the painting layer with the image layer,
enabling you to apply color while
retaining the details of the underlying
image.
6. Select a color you want to apply from
the Swatches palette. Use the Color
palette to mix your own. 
You find information on color in Book
II, Chapter 3.
7. Select the Brush tool in the Tools palette.
8. Click the down arrow next to the Brush Preset picker on the Options bar and
choose a brush from the list.
Hard-edged brushes appear first and the soft-edged brushes follow. I would start
with a soft-edged brush.
The Airbrush option on the Options bar creates a very subtle and soft effect. Just be
sure you pick the kind of brush that works best for the area of the picture you’re col-
orizing. (Use a small, fuzzy brush for smaller areas, and use a bigger, sharper brush
for more defined lines and wider areas.)
9. Paint all the parts of the image where you want to
apply color.
If you make a mistake, you can erase the bad
strokes without affecting the underlying grayscale
image because you’re painting on a separate layer.
In my example, I chose a nice, light blue color to
change the color of the boy’s eyes, as shown in the
figure. A small fuzzy brush is perfect for a small area such as the eyes.
continued

Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools

Change brushes as necessary by clicking the Brush Preset picker on the Options
bar and choosing a larger or smaller brush.
10. When you finish with that area of the image, create a new layer for each of the
main components of the photograph and repeat Steps 4 through 9 with an addi-
tional color.
I painted the eyes, lips, cheeks, hair, and hair highlights separately because creat-
ing natural, subtle effects with people’s skin, hair, and eyes takes a special touch:
 Eyes: When painting the eyes, paint only the irises and leave the pupils their
original black color. Don’t paint over the catchlights in the eyes, either.
(Catchlights are reflections of light sources, such as windows or the flash.)
 Lips: Color the inner surface of the lips a darker, rosier pink than the outer sur-
face. Lips look best when portrayed in at least two shades. Don’t forget to color
the gums with an even lighter pink.
 Hair: Hair looks best when the highlights and darker portions are slightly differ-
ent colors.
 Cheeks: To put a little blush in the cheeks, choose the Airbrush option on the
Options bar and work with a relatively large brush size. Apply a good dash of
color to each cheek, and a lighter bit of color to the forehead and chin. (I used a
300-pixel brush for this high-resolution image.)
I left the clothes and background uncolored to emphasize the focal point is the
boy’s face.
11. For the overall skin tone, I chose a different technique using the Hue/Saturation com-
mand. This technique works especially well with those who have naturally dark
complexions. You can choose to paint the skin with a brush or use this technique:
 Duplicate the grayscale image layer and then choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Hue/Saturation.
 Choose the Colorize option and move the Hue slider to the left to produce a
sepia tone. I set my Hue to 36. Set Saturation to 25 percent and click OK to col-
orize this layer.
 Use the Eraser tool to remove everything in the colorized layer that isn’t skin. In
my example, I removed the hair, background, eyes, lips, teeth, and dress. This
result is a nice sepia tone to the face.
Be sure to pick a color that’s as close to real life as possible. If the subject has
darker skin, you may need to move away from rosier blush tones.
12. When you finish coloring your layers, you can experiment with different opacity
levels for each colorized layer to see if more transparent hues might look better.

Drawing with Vector Shapes
While I am a big fan of photos and all the pixels that make up those photos,
sometimes you have to call on a vector or two. Maybe you need to create a
simple line art graphic for a Web page. Or perhaps you want to add a logo
onto a poster. In these instances, drawing a vector shape with the Pen or
Shape tools is the way to go. 
Before you begin creating vector shapes in Photoshop, having a firm grasp
on the basics of pixels versus vectors is a big help. Vectors describe a shape
mathematically; pixel images, on the other hand, describe the same shape in
terms of a map of pixels. The key difference is that, as you increase the size
of a pixel-based image, it begins to look blocky. Because vector images are
based on mathematical formulas, they look good at any size. Figure 1-8
shows both types of images. I explain the difference between vector and
pixel-based images in more detail in Book II, Chapter 1.

Figure 1-8: Photoshop images fall into one of two camps — vector or pixel.
When you create vector objects in a program like Photoshop, they are com-
prised of paths, which are in turn made up of anchor points and straight
and curved segments, or lines. You can create these points and lines by
working with the preset shapes or by creating your own shape. The presets
are easier to work with, but the custom shapes enable you to be more cre-
ative. In the following sections, I walk you through the steps for creating
vector shapes as well as the various options.
Drawing a preset shape
Follow these steps to draw a preset shape in your document:
1. Choose a Shape tool from the Tools palette.
You can also press U and choose the shape tool from the Options bar.
You can choose from the following shape tools (shown in Figure 1-9):
• Rectangle/Ellipse: The rectangle and ellipse have no special param-
eters on the Options bar; however, they both behave much like their
counterparts among the selection tools. For example, you can press
the Shift key while dragging a shape to produce a perfect square or
circle; press the Shift key plus the Alt key (Option key on the Mac)
to draw the shape outward from the center. You have other geome-
try options that let you determine how you draw the shapes (uncon-
strained, fixed size, from center, and so forth). 
• Rounded Rectangle: This shape has the same options as the rectan-
gle shape, with the addition of a box in which you can type the
radius of the circle used to round off the corners of the rectangle.
• Polygon: This shape includes a box in which you can enter the
number of sides you’d like for the polygon, in the range of 3 to 100,
as well as geometry options.

Figure 1-9: The shape tools and Options bar give you everything you need to make 
shapes from simple squares to ornate fleur de lys.
• Line: You can give the line shape a width from 1 to 1000 pixels and
assign a layer style and/or fill color. You can also enter parameters
for an arrowhead at either or both ends. 
• Custom: You find numerous preset custom shapes to choose from.
As with any shape, you press Shift to constrain proportions or Alt
(Option on the Mac) to draw from the center out. 
2. Choose the mode of shape you want to draw from the three icons on
the Options bar.
Here’s a list of ways in which you can create a shape (all options are on
the Options bar):
• Shape Layers: Click this icon to create the shape in a new layer of its
own. When you choose this mode, icons appear on the Options bar
that let you choose a layer style and/or fill color.

Shape Layers is a good choice if you want to keep your shapes in
separate layers so you can manipulate them further. (Some options
include making the shapes appear to have been added together, sub-
tracted from, and so on.) Photoshop links shapes in a shape layer 
to a vector mask, which can show or hide portions of an image. You
find out more about shape layers and vector masks later in this
chapter. The shapes remain scalable until you change them into
pixels by choosing Layer➪Rasterize➪Shape.
• Paths: Click this icon to create the shape on an existing layer. The
shape appears as a path that you can edit by using the pen tools
and the Paths palette. (For everything you need to know about
paths, check out Book III, Chapter 2.)
• Fill Pixels: Click this icon to create a shaped area filled with the
foreground color. This option doesn’t produce a vector shape, but
instead fills the shape with pixels. The process is similar to filling a
selection created with the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tools or
painting on your canvas with a painting tool. When you choose this
mode, the Options bar includes choices that let you specify a blend-
ing mode, the transparency of the filled area, and whether you want
the area anti-aliased. You cannot edit a shape created with this
option, except to modify the pixels.
3. Select your options — both on the Options bar (if any) and in the
geometry options drop-down palette, which also resides on the
Options bar.
The Options bar changes to reflect each type of shape; each type has its
own options, which are listed in Step 1. For detailed explanations on the
various geometry options, see “Setting geometry options” later in this
chapter.
If you chose the Custom Shape tool in Step 1, click the down-pointing
arrow to access the drop-down Shapes palette. Choose the shape that
works for you. You can access more preset shape libraries via the pop-
up menu at the top of the palette (refer to Figure 1-9).
4. Drag in the document to draw the shape you’ve defined.
The shape appears in the image window. If you chose the Shape Layer
mode in Step 2, the shape also appears in the Layers palette in its own
layer. A rectangle filled with the foreground color appears in the image
column, and the shape itself is shown in the mask column as a vector
mask, as you can see in Figure 1-10. The green layer of color peeks
through my vector mask, which is in the shape of a leaf.

Drawing with Vector Shapes
305
Figure 1-10: When you create a shape layer you are creating a layer of color that shows
through a vector mask (path) in the form of your shape.
Drawing multiple shapes in a shapes layer
After you create a shape layer, you can draw additional shapes in the layer,
adding to the vector mask associated with that layer. You can add, subtract,
overlap, and intersect shapes in exactly the same way you do with selec-
tions, as described in Book III, Chapter 3. Here’s how it works:
1. After you create the first shape, as I explain in the preceding section,
select your desired state button on the Options bar:
• Add to Shape Area: Combines and joins two or more shapes
• Subtract from Shape Area: Subtracts one shape from another 
shape 
Book IV
Chapter 1
Painting and

Drawing with Vector Shapes
306
• Intersect Shape Areas: Creates a shape only from the areas that
overlap
• Exclude Overlapping Shape Areas: Creates a shape only from the
areas that do not overlap
2. Grab your desired shape tool and draw the next shape.
Press the Shift key to temporarily switch to Add to Shape Area while
drawing a new shape. Press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) to tem-
porarily switch to Subtract from Shape Area. This works just like adding
or subtracting selections.
Setting geometry options
Geometry options for your shapes (rectangle/rounded rectangle, ellipse,
polygon, line, and custom) help define how the shapes look. Click the down-
pointing arrow on the Options bar to access the geometry options. The fol-
lowing sections show you what you can do with these options.
Rectangular-shape Geometry options
Here are the Geometry options for the rectangle and rounded rectangle
shapes, as shown in Figure 1-11:
 Unconstrained: When you have this option (the default) selected, Photo-
shop defines the size and proportions of the rectangle as you drag.
 Square: Select this button to constrain the shape to a perfect square.
(You can also press the Shift key to do the same thing on the fly.)
 Fixed Size: This option lets you draw rectangles only in fixed sizes.
Specify the exact size by entering a width and height.
 Proportional: This option lets you define an aspect ratio, or propor-
tion, for the rectangle. Type 3 into the W box, and 4 into the H box, and
you’re constrained to drawing any size rectangle with fixed proportions
in a 3:4 ratio.
Figure 1-11: Geometry options define how your particular shape appears.

Drawing with Vector Shapes
307
 From Center: Select this option to expand the shape from the center
point you click.
 Snap to Pixels: This option aligns the shape to the pixels on your
screen.
Elliptical-shape Geometry options
The ellipse shape has the same options that are available for rectangles
(also shown in Figure 1-12). Of course, instead of being able to create a per-
fect square, you can restrain the shape to be a perfect circle. Also, the Snap
to Pixels option (available for rectangles) doesn’t exist for ellipses.
Polygonal-shape Geometry options
These are the Geometry options for the
polygon shape, as shown in Figure 1-12:
 Radius: You can enter the radius
of a circle used to round off the
corners of a polygon when you
have the Smooth Corners option
selected.
 Smooth Corners: Choose this
option to round off the corners.
 Star: Select this option to create a
star shape — that is, a polygon
where the sides indent inward
rather than extend outward from
the corner points.
 Indent Sides By: The value entered here determines the amount the
sides indent inward.
 Smooth Indents: This option rounds off the inner corners created by
indenting the sides.
 Sides: Indicate the number of sides for your polygon or the number of
points for your star.
Line Geometry options
The line’s Geometry settings include whether to put arrowheads at the start
or end of the line, or both, as shown in Figure 1-13. Figure 1-13 also shows
how changing the width, length, and concavity settings affect the arrowhead
shapes.

Custom-shape Geometry options
The custom shape options are similar
to those you find for the other
Geometry shapes — with a couple of
additions, shown in Figure 1-14: 
 Defined Proportions: When you
use this option, Photoshop limits
any shapes created using this new
custom shape to the proportions
you use when you create it now.
That is, you can change the size of
a new shape but only in propor-
tion with the original custom shape you create.
 Defined Size: When you use this option, Photoshop limits any shapes
generated based on this new custom shape to the size you set now.
Creating your own custom shape
You can create your own custom shape by defining the shape using a vector
mask, work path, or saved path. You can find out more about creating work
paths and saved paths in Book III, Chapter 2. To create a shape and add it to
your shape library, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Pen tool from the Tools palette, or press Shift+P until the
Pen tool is selected.
2. Select the Shape Layers icon on the Options bar and use the Pen to
draw the shape you want to create.
Book III, Chapter 2 describes the techniques for adding, removing, and
adjusting the shapes of curves with the Pen tool.

Photoshop automatically places the shape you create in its own shape
layer as a vector mask. Find out more about what you can do with a
vector mask in the following section, “Using vector masks.”
3. In the Paths palette, select the path or vector mask you want to con-
vert into a custom shape.
4. Choose Edit➪Define Custom Shape from the menu bar.
The Shape Name dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-15.
Figure 1-15: Create your own shapes when you tire of the presets.
5. Enter a descriptive name for your new shape in the dialog box and
then click OK.
The new shape appears in the custom shapes pop-up palette on the
Options bar.
6. Choose Save Shapes from the palette’s pop-up menu to store your new
library on your hard drive.
Although you can’t create a shape with the Preset Manager, you can use it to
manage the shapes in your shape library.
Using vector masks
When you create a shape in Shape layer mode, Photoshop automatically
saves the shape as a vector mask. Essentially, a shape layer has two compo-
nents. First, Photoshop entirely fills the layer with color. Then, Photoshop
places the shape, which (again) is comprised of a path, on top. The thumb-
nails in the Layers palette visually display this concept. The color peeks
through the outline of the shape, and Photoshop hides (or masks) the rest
of the layer. So in other words, vector masks clip away the color of a shape
layer. If you delete a vector mask, you are left with just a layer of solid color. 
Like all vector objects, vector paths print at the full resolution of the printer
and are resolution-independent.

You can edit a shape that Photoshop has saved as a vector mask at any
time. Simply click the vector mask thumbnail to select it. Then use the
Shape and Pen tools to edit the shape.
Here are some additional things you can do with a vector mask:
 To remove a vector mask, drag its thumbnail in the Layers palette to
the trash can icon at the bottom of the palette. You can also select the
layer and choose Layer➪Vector Mask➪Delete.
 To enable or disable a vector mask, Shift+click its thumbnail in the
Layers palette, or select the layer and choose Layer➪Vector Mask➪
Disable (or Enable) . Photoshop marks the thumbnails of disabled
vector masks with an X.
 You can convert a vector mask to a layer mask by selecting the layer
and choosing Layer➪Rasterize➪Vector Mask.
Manipulating shapes
You can manipulate shapes you create by using a variety of tools. Here’s a
quick list of the things you can do:
 Move: Choose the Move tool (press V) to move shapes in their layer.
 Delete: Select a shape and press Delete to remove it.
 Adjust anchor points: Use the Direct Selection tool to manipulate
anchor points, directional handles, lines, and curves.
 Transform shapes: Use Edit➪Transform Path or select the Show
Bounding Box option on the Options bar to transform shapes. For more
information, see Book III, Chapter 3.
 Align and distribute shapes: Use active buttons on the Options bar
when you have the Move tool selected to change alignment and distri-
bution along an imaginary line (shown on the button).
 Clone a shape: Press Alt (Option on the Mac) and move the shape with
the Path Selection tool.
You find more information on manipulating shapes in Book III, Chapter 2.
Remember that if you select the Fill Pixels option on the Options bar, you’re
stuck without editing capabilities.

Chapter 2: Filling and Stroking
In This Chapter
 Filling and stroking selections
 Filling or stroking paths
 Building and applying gradients
 Creating and applying patterns
P
hotoshop offers several ways to create elements, such as geometric
shapes, out of pixels and filling and stroking them are two of the most
venerable commands at your disposal. You can also paint geometric ele-
ments on your canvas by hand, or convert vector shapes to pixels (see
Book IV, Chapter 1 for more on that topic). But if you need pixels arranged
into regular circles, ellipses, and polygons, the Fill and Stroke facilities of
Photoshop are worthy of your consideration.
Here’s how they work:
 The Fill command adds color or a pattern to a
selection of any shape or form you have created. 
 The Stroke command applies color around the
selection outline only. 
This chapter shows you how to create these objects
by filling and stroking selections and paths, how to
add smooth gradient blends, and the best ways to
apply patterns. After reading this chapter, you will
have your fill of different strokes.
Another way of filling is through the use of a fill layer,
which you can use to fill a shape. Because fill layers work a
little differently from the types of fills discussed in this chapter,
I cover them in Book V, Chapter 1.
Filling a Selection with a Solid Color
When you just want to add a solid color, you use either the foreground or
background color. (These colors appear at the bottom of the Tools palette,
as I explain in Book I, Chapter 2.) The following steps show you the basics of

Filling Options and Tips
312
filling a selection with either the foreground or background color (you have
plenty of other filling options, which I discuss later in the chapter):
1. Create your selection on a layer.
See Book III for all you need to know about selections and Book V for
the scoop on layers.
2. Choose a fill color as the foreground or background color.
Choose Window➪Color. Use the color sliders to mix your desired color.
For more on choosing color, see Book II, Chapter 3.
3. Choose Edit➪Fill.
The Fill dialog box, shown in
Figure 2-1, appears. Here, you
can select whether to fill with the
foreground or background color.
You also can choose color (which
will launch the Color Picker),
black, 50 percent gray, white, 
history, or pattern. 
4. Click OK.
The foreground (or background)
color fills the selection.
You can also choose a blend mode, the opacity of the fill, and whether to fill
the entire selection or only portions of the selection that contain pixels (the
nontransparent areas). I recommend not adjusting your blend mode and
opacity in the Fill dialog box, but instead creating a new layer for your fill and
adjusting those settings in the Layers palette, where you have more flexibility.
Filling Options and Tips
After you make a selection, you’re ready to use one of the filling options.
You can use the Fill dialog box (as described in the preceding section) to
fill the selection with the foreground or background color; you can also
choose to fill the selection with color, black, white, or gray. Photoshop is full
of shortcuts and options. Here are just a few:
 With the selection active, press Alt+Delete (Option+Delete on the Mac)
to fill it with the foreground color. All areas within the selection, includ-
ing transparent areas, fill with the color.
 Fill only the pixels in a selection with the foreground color, leaving any
transparent pixels transparent, by pressing Alt+Shift+Backspace (or
Option+Shift+Delete on the Mac). For more on transparency, see Book V,
Chapter 1.
Figure 2-1: You can fill your selection
with color, history, or a pattern.

Filling Options and Tips
313
Lock the transparent pixels in a layer (and its selections) by clicking the
Transparency icon in the Lock area of the Layers palette.
 If you’re working on the Background layer, you can also fill the selection
with the background color by pressing the Delete key. (Pressing Delete
on other layers creates a transparent area that shows the image in the
layer underneath the selection.)
 By choosing the Color option in the Fill dialog box, you access the Color
Picker where you can select any color of the rainbow to fill your selec-
tion with. For more on using the Color Picker, see Book II, Chapter 3.
 Choose the Pattern option in the Fill dialog box to fill the selection with
a pattern. Click the arrow next to the pattern swatch and select a pat-
tern from the pop-up palette. Click the pattern palette pop-up menu to
choose more pattern libraries. 
 Select the History option in the Fill dialog box to restore the selection to
a state or snapshot of the image. For more on working with the History
palette, see Book II, Chapter 4.
 Paint part or all the interior of the selection by using any of the brush
tools, as shown in Figure 2-2. This option lets you partially fill a selection
by using a bit of flexibility and creativity. When you paint a selection
with brush tools, Photoshop confines the paint inside the boundaries of
your selection. For more on painting, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
 Pour color from the Paint Bucket tool into the selection.

Pouring with the Paint Bucket Tool
314
Pouring with the Paint Bucket Tool
The Paint Bucket tool, available from the Tools palette where it shares a
flyout menu with the Gradient tool, operates much like a combination of the
Brush tool and the Magic Wand tool, as you’ll see from looking over its
options. To use it, select the tool (press Shift+G until it’s active) and click
inside the selection you want to fill. Here are your options, all of which are
on the Options bar:
 Fill: You can choose whether to fill with the foreground color or a pattern.
 Pattern: When you’ve chosen Pattern from the Options bar, you can
select a preset pattern, load patterns from your pattern libraries, or
create a pattern of your own. You find more information on patterns
later in this chapter.
 Mode: You can select a fill mode, too. You find more information on
these modes in Book V, Chapter 3.
 Opacity: Adjust this value to make your fill semitransparent.
 Tolerance: Like the Magic Wand tool, you can choose a tolerance level
that specifies how similar in brightness a pixel must be before it is
selected for painting. You can find more information on tolerance levels
in Book III, Chapter 1.
 Anti-alias: Choose this option to blend the paint in smoothly with the
areas not filled.
 Contiguous: When selected, the paint fills only pixels that are touching
within your selection. When deselected, paint fills all pixels within the
brightness tolerance you specify within your selection.
 All Layers: This option applies paint to pixels in all layers that are
within the selection and brightness/tolerance levels you specify.
As with other tools that fill, you can prevent the Paint Bucket tool from fill-
ing the transparent pixels. Just select the Transparency icon in the Lock
area of the Layers palette.
Stroking a Selection
Stroking enables you to create outlines of selections, layers, or paths.
Stroking a selection creates a border around the selection. It’s up to you to
decide whether to put the border inside, outside, or centered on the selec-
tion. (Photoshop doesn’t care either way.)
To stroke a selection, follow these steps:
1. Choose a foreground color and make a selection.

Stroking a Selection
315
(Stroke can’t automatically use the background color, although you can
select that color in the dialog box.)
2. Choose Edit➪Stroke.
3. In the Stroke dialog box, adjust the settings and the options, as shown
in Figure 2-3.
• Width: You can select 1 to 250 pixels. You can also type a value by
using another measurement, such as inches, but Photoshop con-
verts it to pixel values before applying.
• Color: Click in the Color box to select the hue you want from the
Color Picker.
• Location: Select where Photoshop should apply the stroke.
• Mode: This determines how the stroke merges with other colors.
• Opacity: The default value is 100 percent. If you want the stroke to
be semitransparent, type another value. 
• Preserve Transparency: Choose this option to apply the stroke only
to nontransparent pixels.
4. Click OK to apply the stroke.
Figure 2-3: Apply strokes to your selection up to 250 pixels wide.

I recommend leaving the blend mode and opacity setting options in the
Stroke dialog box alone. Instead of adjusting these settings, create a new
layer for your stroke and then choose a different blend mode and opacity
setting in the Layers palette. This maximizes your ability to make edits.
Working with Gradients
A gradient is a wonderful blend of colors that you can apply to a layer or
selection, gradually fading from one hue to another. Gradients can involve
more than two colors, producing a veritable rainbow of variations. You can
apply gradients by using preset selections of colors, or you can create your
own gradient.
You can create the following gradient effects:
 Foreground to background: The gradient is a transition from the cur-
rent foreground color to the background color.
 Foreground to transparent: The gradient is a transition from the cur-
rent foreground color to transparent, allowing whatever is under the
transparent portion to show through.
 Black to white: The gradient is a transition from black to white.
 An array of colorful selections: This includes rainbows, coppery
sheens, and other effects.
You can load other libraries of gradients from the Gradient palette menu’s
libraries. They have names such as Color Harmonies, Metals, and Special
Effects. For more information on managing preset libraries, see Book I,
Chapter 5.
In addition to being able to control the appearance and application of a gra-
dient, you also have the opportunity to adjust the Gradient tool’s options,
all of which are on the Options bar:
 Mode: Select any of Photoshop’s blending modes.
 Opacity: Choose how transparent the gradient is.
 Reverse: Reverse the order in which the colors are applied.
 Dither: Add noise, or random information, to produce a smoother gradi-
ent that prints with less banding (color stripes caused by the limitations
of the printing process to reproduce a full range of colors).
 Transparency: This option determines whether Photoshop ignores the
gradient’s transparency settings when you apply a gradient. If you dese-
lect this option, all portions of the gradient are fully opaque. I show you
how to add transparency to a gradient later in this chapter.

Working with Gradients
317
Applying a preset gradient to a selection
Here’s how to apply a preset gradient:
1. Choose the layer from the Layers palette and/or make the selection
you want to apply the gradient to.
2. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools palette, or press G or Shift+G
until the Gradient tool becomes active.
3. Choose one of the preset gradients from the Gradient Picker drop-
down menu on the Options bar.
4. Choose the gradient type by clicking one of
the icons on the Options bar. Figure 2-4 illus-
trates each gradient type.
Linear: Blends the colors of the gradient
from start color to end color in a straight
line.
Radial: Blends the colors from start to
end in a circular arrangement.
Angle: Creates a counterclockwise sweep
around the starting point, resembling a
radar screen.
Reflected: Blends the colors by using sym-
metrical linear gradients on either side of
the starting point.
Diamond: Blends the colors outward in a
diamond pattern.
5. Choose any other options you want from
the Options bar.
I explain these options in “Working with Gradients,” earlier in this chapter.
6. Place the cursor at the position in the layer or selection where you
want to place the starting color of the gradient.
7. Drag in any direction to the point you want to place the end color.
Longer drags result in a subtle transition between colors, whereas
shorter drags result in a more abrupt transition. Press the Shift key to
restrain the direction of the gradient to an even 45-degree angle.
8. Release the mouse button to apply the gradient.
The gradient I created is shown in Figure 2-5.

Customizing and editing gradients
Although Photoshop includes dozens of different gradient presets, you
may want to create your own. Perhaps you’d like to create a gradient with
your company colors or build one to match the predominant colors in an
image. Or you might want to create a gradient that includes more than
two colors. The Gradient Editor lets you create your own gradient preset,
using two or as many colors as you want, which you can save and reuse at
any time.
The Gradient Editor has lots of options, but it’s easy to use when you know
what all the controls and options do. Follow these steps to create a simple
smooth gradient:
1. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools palette.
2. Click in the gradient sample window itself (not the arrow) on the
Options bar.
The Gradient Editor dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-6.
3. Pick an existing gradient preset from the Presets windows to use as
your basis for your new gradient. 

Working with Gradients
319
Figure 2-6: The Gradient Editor enables you to create 
custom gradients.
4. Choose Solid or Noise from the Gradient Type pop-up menu.
As soon as you start to edit the existing gradient, the name of the gradi-
ent changes to Custom. A Noise gradient is one containing random
colors. Because the colors are random, each time you create a noise
gradient the result is different. You can choose which color mode to use
and how rough the gradient is and select a range of acceptable colors.
As soon as you start to edit the existing gradient, the name of the gradi-
ent changes to Custom. A Noise gradient is one containing random

and how rough the gradient is and select a range of acceptable colors.
5. Adjust the Smoothness slider. Drag the slider (click the right-pointing
arrow) or enter a value to determine how smoothly to blend your
colors into one another. 
If you chose Noise in the previous step, the slider changes to Roughness.
This option affects how smooth or abruptly one color transitions into
another.

6. You can set the following options only if you chose Noise in Step 4.
• Color Model: Select your desired color model or limit the range
of colors by adjusting the sliders. See Book II, Chapter 2 for more on
color models.
• Restrict Colors: Limits the colors to printable CMYK colors only.
Again, see Book II, Chapter 2 for details.
• Add Transparency: Lets you include transparency in your gradient,
if desired.
• Randomize: Changes the colors in your gradient. Each time you
click Randomize, you get a new set of colors.
7. To begin defining the color of the starting point for your gradient,
first click the left color stop button under the gradient bar.
The triangle on top of the stop turns black to indicate you are working
with the starting point of the gradient. Remember because Noise gradi-
ents are random, you cannot define the colors.
8. Choose the starting color by using one of these methods:
• Double-click the left color stop and select a color from the Color
dialog box that appears.
• Double-click the Color box in the Stops area of the dialog box and
choose a color from the dialog box.
• Choose Foreground, Background, or User Color from the Color pop-
up menu in the Stops area of the dialog box.
Keep in mind that if you select color with the Foreground or
Background option when you change the foreground or background
color, the color in the gradient changes automatically. The change
doesn’t affect any gradients you’ve already created, but it does
affect any future gradients. However, when you open the Gradient
Editor again, you can revert to your original foreground or back-
ground color by selecting the User Color option.
• Position the cursor (it appears as an eyedropper icon) anywhere in
the gradient bar to select a start color from the bar, or position the
cursor anywhere within an image on your screen, and then click to
select the color under the cursor.
9. Click the end point color stop at the right side of the gradient bar and
use any of the methods described in Step 8 to choose the end color of
the gradient.
10. Change the percentage of one color to the other by moving the starting
or ending point’s color stops to the left or right. Drag the midpoint
slider (a diamond icon) to adjust where the colors mix equally, 50-50.
You can also change the position of the midpoint by typing a value into
the Location box.

Working with Gradients
321
Because the center point of the gradient is halfway between the start
and end points, the gradient proceeds smoothly from one color to the
other, meeting to blend evenly in the middle. Moving the color stops
and the midpoint changes the proportions.
11. Want to add another color? Just click below the gradient bar at the
position you want to add the next color. Define a color for the new
color.
12. Repeat Step 11 for additional colors.
Heck, you can keep going like this for hours.
13. Move all your color stops to the left or right to assign percentages for
the additional colors. Then adjust the midpoint sliders between the
colors.
14. If you change your mind, you can redefine the color or click the
Delete button.
You can also remove a color stop by dragging it down or up from its
position on the gradient bar.
15. Once your edits are complete, give your gradient a name if you prefer
and click the New button.
Your gradient is added to the Presets menu. Figure 2-7 shows an exam-
ple of a unique gradient I created in the Gradient Editor.

Adding transparency to a gradient
By default, a gradient has 100-percent opacity in the start color and pro-
gresses to 100-percent opacity in the end color. If you like, you can have
the gradient fade out to transparency so that the portion of the image
under the gradient shows through. To add transparency to a gradient,
follow these steps.
1. Create a gradient, as described in the two previous sections.
2. Select the left opacity stop.
This stop is located just above the gradient bar, as shown in Figure 2-8.
Figure 2-8: Lighten your gradients by adjusting the 
opacity of your colors.
3. Use the Opacity slider to specify the amount of transparency for the
gradient at its start point.
You can also type a value into the Opacity box.
4. Select the right opacity stop and slide the Opacity slider or enter a
percentage in the text box to specify transparency for the gradient
at its end point. 
The lower the percentage, the less opaque the color.
5. Move the opacity stops to the right or left to adjust the position where
Photoshop applies each stop’s opacity setting.

Managing and Saving Gradients
323
6. Click above the gradient bar to add more opacity stops if you want to
vary the transparency of the gradient at different points.
For example, you could fade transparency from 100 percent to 50 percent
back to 100 percent to produce a particular effect. Figure 2-9 shows a
gradient with varying levels of transparency.
Figure 2-9: Transparency gives a gradient a different look.
Gradients ordinarily proceed smoothly from one color to another. If you’d
like a less homogeneous appearance, adjust the Smoothness slider to a value
of less than 100 percent (click the right-pointing arrow to access the slider).
Managing and Saving Gradients
If you’re smart, you’ll want to store the gradients you create so that you can
use or edit them again later. Here are some tips for managing your gradients:
 To save a gradient, click the Save button in the Gradient Editor dialog
box. You save the current presets, including your new gradient, under
the current library’s name or another one that you choose.
 To load gradient presets into the Gradient Editor, click the Load button
and select the name of the gradient library you want to add to the
Presets list.
 To add an additional set of presets to the current presets, choose the
name of the presets from the Gradient Editor’s pop-up menu.

For more information about managing gradient presets with the Preset
Manager, see Book I, Chapter 5.
Working with Patterns
Patterns are textures or repeating configurations of pixels that you can use
to fill selections or layers, apply with painting tools, smear around your
image with the Pattern Stamp, or use as a basis for the Healing Brush and
Patch tools. Photoshop offers a large selection of patterns, you can down-
load an even larger selection and you can even create your own in two 
different ways.
You select patterns from palettes that appear on the Options bar for many
of the tools just mentioned, much like brush tips and gradients, and you
manage them in much the same way, using the Preset Manager (see Book I,
Chapter 5). The following sections show you how to apply a preset pattern
and create your own.
Applying a preset pattern
Although you can apply patterns by using many different tools, this chapter
sticks with applying patterns as fills. To fill a layer or selection with a preset
pattern, follow these steps.
1. Choose the layer or selection you want to fill with a pattern.
2. Choose Edit➪Fill and select Pattern from the Use pop-up menu.
3. In the Custom Pattern palette, select the pattern you want to fill with.
• Choose a pattern from the drop-down palette, as shown in
Figure 2-10.
• Replace the current patterns with new patterns by choosing Replace
Patterns from the palette pop-up menu (click the right-pointing arrow
at the right side of the dialog box). Then choose the new pattern
library from the dialog box that appears.
• Append new patterns to the current set by choosing Load Patterns
from the palette pop-up menu.
• Append one of the preset libraries furnished with Photoshop by
choosing the pattern from the list at the bottom of the palette menu.
4. Choose any other fill options you want to apply, such as Mode,
Opacity, or Preserve Transparency.
The Preserve Transparency option prevents Photoshop from filling the
transparent areas on your layer with a pattern.

Working with Patterns
325
Figure 2-10: Fill your selection with purple daisies or one of the many 
other Photoshop preset patterns.
I recommend adjusting the Mode and Opacity settings in the Layers
palette rather than the Fill dialog box. This allows you the maximum
flexibility if you want to make edits later.
5. Click OK to fill the layer or selection with the chosen pattern.
Creating a new pattern
You can create your own pattern, basing it on an existing image or on one
you create yourself. Select a small portion of an image to build an abstract
pattern, or use a recognizable object to define that object as a pattern
stamp. You can use anything from a logo to your signature as a pattern.
To create your own pattern, follow these steps:
1. Open the image that contains the area you want to use as a pattern,
or create an image from scratch.
2. Make any modifications to the image to produce the exact pattern
that you want.
Book IV
Chapter 2
Filling and Stroking

Working with Patterns
326
3. Use the Rectangular Marquee tool to select the area you want to con-
vert into a pattern.
If you don’t make a selection, Photoshop uses your entire image as a
basis for the pattern.
Note that if you are using a selection to define your pattern you must
use a rectangular selection. Note that you cannot use a feathered selec-
tion of any kind.
4. Choose Edit➪Define Pattern.
5. Enter a name for your pattern in the Define Pattern dialog box.
Your new pattern appears in the Pattern palette for use.
Using the Pattern Maker filter
The Pattern Maker filter is an advanced tool that provides even more ways
to customize your patterns. This easy-to-use dialog box, shown in Figure 2-11,
helps you build a pattern that fills an entire layer of your choice. The cool
part is that you can create a whole series of different patterns and review
them to find the one you like best.
Figure 2-11: The Pattern Maker enables you to create patterns that 
tile seamlessly.
As with creating a pattern from a selection, you must use a rectangular shape
to build your new pattern. If your selection is irregular or feathered when
you enter the Pattern Maker dialog box, Photoshop forces a rectangular
selection around your irregular or feathered selection.

Working with Patterns
327
The most valuable feature of the Pattern Maker is that it creates patterns
that tile smoothly. That is, you can repeat the pattern as many times as you
need to fill an area, and the boundaries between sections blend together
smoothly. The Pattern Maker command is on the Filter menu.
To create a pattern using this filter, just follow these steps:
1. To apply a pattern to an existing image, first make a copy of the layer
that contains the image area you want to convert to a pattern.
To apply the pattern to a new image, select the area you want to use
with the Rectangular Marquee tool and choose Edit➪Copy. Then choose
File➪New, choose Custom from the New File dialog box, click OK to create
the new file, and paste (Edit➪Paste) the selection into the new image.
2. Choose Filter➪Pattern Maker.
3. Select the area to be used as the basis for the pattern.
4. If you’re creating the pattern in the current layer, choose the
Rectangular Marquee tool from the dialog box’s Tools palette, and
select the portion of the image you want to convert to a pattern.
You can drag the selection marquee around the image, use the zoom fea-
tures to change the magnification, or drag the image around by using
the Hand tool.
5. If you want to completely fill the layer with tiled versions of the pat-
tern, specify the size of the tile by typing values in the Width and
Height boxes in the Tile Generation area. You can also enter the
offset (None, Horizontal, or Vertical) to use and the amount of that
offset. If you’d rather have only a single, non-tiled image, click the
Use Image Size button.
6. Set other options:
• Smoothness: Set a value to determine how smooth the edges of the
patterns are blended with the surrounding tiles.
• Sample Detail: This parameter controls the maximum size of details
in the pattern.
• Preview: Choose whether to display the original image or the gener-
ated patterns in the Preview window.
• Tile Boundaries: If you want, you can insert a line between tiled
images to show their boundaries. Select the Tile Boundaries option
and, if you like, choose a color for the boundary that will show up
well against your sampled image.
7. Click the Generate button to create a pattern from your selection. You
can click the button multiple times to create multiple pattern variations.
Photoshop displays all the different patterns you generate in the Tile
History panel in the lower-right corner of the dialog box.

bottom-left edge of the Tile History panel.
9. You can get rid of patterns that
you don’t like by selecting them
and then clicking the trash can
icon at the lower-right edge.
Tile History can save up to 20 gen-
erated patterns.
10. Click OK if you want to apply the

and Editing Type
In This Chapter
 Discovering different kinds of type
 Exploring the type tools
 Entering and editing text
P
hotoshop has morphed into a surprisingly good tool for creating type
used in images. Features have been added that let you create para-
graphs of text or simple lines of text used as headlines or labels. You can
change the spacing between characters, warp your type, check your
spelling, or create selections in the shape of text. Drop shadows, beveled
type, and other special effects are yours quickly and easily. And you
can even place text on or inside a path.
You may still want to use Adobe Illustrator or InDesign
to create professional layouts where you can keep
text and image files separate, or where you have to
place buckets full of text at small point sizes. But if
what you’re looking for is a great-looking image that
includes great-looking snippets of text, Photoshop
can do the job. This chapter introduces you to
Photoshop’s basic type tools as well as its more
advanced type capabilities.
Selecting a Type Mode
The text you create in Photoshop can be categorized in sev-
eral different ways, but ultimately, you’re either adding just a
little text (such as a word or single line of text) or a lot (maybe a paragraph
or so). Accordingly, Photoshop separates type into two modes:
 Point type: Use this mode to create a headline or label. You can create
point type by clicking in your image and typing; the line appears as you
type and grows to whatever length you need (even if that length is
wider or taller than your image). Point type never wraps around to a
new line. To wrap to the next line, you must insert a hard return.

Understanding Different Kinds of Type
330
 Paragraph type: Use this mode to enter longer blocks of text on an
image. It’s (unsurprisingly) similar to the kind of type you’re accus-
tomed to working with in word processing programs. In Paragraph
mode, all the text goes into a resizable bounding box, and if a line is too
long, Photoshop automatically wraps it around to the next line. 
The Point type and Paragraph type modes each operate a bit differently,
although they share many features and options. I explain each of them sepa-
rately later in this chapter.
Understanding Different Kinds of Type
Whether you’re using Point type mode or Paragraph type mode, you can
choose several type options, each designed to help you work with, display,
print, and edit text. These options determine how Photoshop expresses text
in a file:
 Vector type: All text in Photoshop is initially created as vector type.
Vector type provides scalable outlines that you can resize without pro-
ducing jaggy edges in the diagonal strokes. You can also edit type in
this mode, adding or subtracting characters or adjusting attributes,
such as kerning and tracking. Vector type is always of optimum quality
and appears crisp and clean. (See Book II, Chapter 2 for more details on
vector and rasterized images.)
 Rasterized type: When Photoshop converts vector type into pixels, it’s
rasterized. When text is rasterized, it is no longer editable, but is, rather,
a frozen graphic of what the text looks like. When you’ve finished edit-
ing vector type and want to merge the text with the other pixels in an
image (or to perform some manipulations that can be done only with
rasterized text), you can transform the vector type into pixels by raster-
izing it. You can’t resize rasterized type without losing some quality or
risking a bad case of the jaggies. 
 Pixel fonts: Pixel fonts are tiny fonts designed for display at small sizes
on computer screens, especially Web sites. Pixel fonts are designed so
every pixel corresponds to a pixel on your screen. These fonts, with
names like MINI 7, MiniSerif, and Tenacity, are created in fixed sizes
(say, 7 pixels high for MINI 7 or 10 pixels high for Tenacity and

Exploring the Type Tools
331
PixelDust). Diagonal lines are avoided as much as possible, with the
font designs favoring horizontal and
vertical strokes. As a result, pixel
fonts look crisp and clear at small
sizes without anti-aliasing (smooth-
ing around the edges). Indeed, you
shouldn’t use anti-aliasing with pixel
fonts, nor should you attempt to
resize or rescale them. You can buy
or download pixel fonts, install
them on your computer, and use
them just as you use other fonts.
You can see some examples of
pixel fonts in Figure 3-1.
Exploring the Type Tools
Strictly speaking, Photoshop has four type tools (found in the Tools palette),
but two of them are simply vertically oriented versions of the main two text
implements. You can use either Paragraph or Point type mode with any of
the type tools:
 Horizontal Type: Use this tool to enter point or paragraph type ori-
ented horizontally on your screen. If you want text that is oriented 
at an angle other than vertical, you can rotate it by choosing
Edit➪Transform➪Rotate after you enter the text. This tool creates the
type on its own type layer, except when used in Bitmap, Multichannel,
or Indexed Color modes, which don’t support layers. (Book II, Chapter 2
covers these modes.)
 Vertical Type: The Vertical Type and Vertical Type Mask tools
(described next) are handy for entering Asian characters. However, you
can also use this tool to enter Roman character point type oriented 
in a vertical column. You can also use the Vertical Type tool to create
columns of paragraph text, but the results look a little strange. After you
enter your text columns, you can rotate the text to an orientation other
than vertical by choosing Edit➪Rotate. Like the Horizontal Type tool,
this tool creates type in its own type layer, except with file modes that
don’t support layers.

332
 Horizontal Type Mask /Vertical Type Mask: These tools operate identi-
cally to their siblings described in the two preceding bullets, with two
exceptions. Instead of adding filled type, both the Horizontal and Vertical
Type Mask tools create a selection border in the shape of the type you
enter. Both tools add a selection marquee to the current active layer.
You can do anything with a type selection that you can do with any other
selection, including saving it (Select➪Save Selection) for reuse later.
You find a longer discussion of the type mask tools later in this chapter.
The Horizontal and Vertical Type tools have some interesting options,
which I explain in the next section. You can also set controls in the
Paragraph and Character palettes, which I discuss later in this chapter.
Entering Text in Point Type Mode
If you’re image oriented (and why wouldn’t you be if you’re using Photoshop?),
you’re probably not planning to include a novella with your graphics. 
Point type is great for headlines, labels, and similar small amounts of text.
You can also use it to create logos and headings for Web pages. The Web is
one place that text that isn’t tack-sharp can still do the job. 
Although a Photoshop image is generally not the place you want to insert a
whole lot of text, you can add larger blocks of text that are professional and
effective — read “Entering Text in Paragraph Type Mode,” later in this chap-
ter. You can modify how point type and paragraph type are displayed by
using the Paragraph and Character palettes.
To enter point type, just follow these steps:
1. Open a saved image or create a new Photoshop document.
2. Select either the Horizontal or Vertical Type tool from the Tools
palette, or press T to select the type tool if the one you want is active.
Press the Shift key and then T to cycle through the four available type
tools until the one that you want is active.
Your cursor looks like an I-beam, similar to one you see in a word pro-
cessing program.
3. Click the area of the image where you want to insert the text. 
This is called the insertion point.
A small horizontal line about one-third of the way up the I-beam shows
where the baseline (on which the line of text rests) is for horizontal type.
If you select the Vertical Type tool, the cursor is rotated 90 degrees.
The baseline is centered in the I-beam and represents the center axis
of the vertical column of text you type.

Entering Text in Paragraph Type Mode
333
4. Choose any of the type options from the Options bar, Character palette,
or Paragraph palette. To access the palettes, click the Character and
Paragraph toggle button on the Options bar or choose either palette
on the Window menu.
I describe these options later in the chapter. 
5. Type your text. Press Enter (or Return on the Mac) to begin a new line.
Lines of point type don’t wrap around. When you press Enter or Return,
you’re inserting a hard carriage return that doesn’t move. You have to
remove hard returns if you want to change the length of the lines you type.
6. When you finish entering the text, click the Commit (the check icon)
button on the Options bar.
A new type layer with your text is created. Note the layer that appears
in your Layers palette, as indicated by the T icon.
Entering Text in Paragraph Type Mode
Paragraphs are best allocated to captions or text descriptions that accom-
pany an image. Large amounts of text in an image don’t look their best
because when you rasterize the type, even the most carefully entered text
may have a fuzzy look.
Paragraph type is similar to the text you’re accustomed to entering within a
word processing program, except that it’s contained inside a border, called a
text box or a bounding box. As you type into a text box, the lines of text wrap
around to fit the dimensions of the box. If you resize the box, Photoshop
adjusts the wrapped ends to account for the new size.
You can type multiple paragraphs, use typographical controls, and rotate or
scale the type. You can easily resize paragraph type (and point type, too) by
entering a new point size value in the Character dialog box without having
to reselect all the text. Just make sure the text layer is selected in the Layers
palette and the Text tool is active. This works for all the other text charac-
teristics as well.
To enter paragraph type, follow these steps:
1. Open a saved image or create a new Photoshop document.
2. Select either the Horizontal or Vertical Type tool from the Tools
palette, or press T to select the type tool if the one you want is active.
Press the Shift key and then T to cycle through the four available type
tools until the one you want is active.
Your cursor looks like an I-beam, similar to one you see in a word pro-
cessing program.

3. Insert and size the text box by using one of the following methods:
• Drag to create a text box of an arbitrary size. After you release the
mouse button, you can drag any of the handles at the corners and
sides of the box to customize the size.
• Press the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and drag a box of any
size. The Paragraph Text Size dialog box appears. You can enter the
exact dimensions of the box you want to create. When you click OK,
a bounding box of the size you specified appears, complete with
handles for resizing the box later, if you choose.
4. Choose the type options you want from the Options bar, or Character
or Paragraph palettes.
5. Enter your text. To start a new paragraph, press Enter (or Return on
the Mac).
Each line wraps around to fit inside the bounding box, as you can see in
Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-2: Paragraph text automatically wraps to conform to your bounding box.

Creating Type on or in a Path
335
If you type more text than fits in the text box, an overflow icon appears.
You can resize the text box by gripping any of the eight handles and
dragging.
6. Click the Commit button on the Options bar (the button looks like a
check mark).
Photoshop creates a new type layer.
Creating Type on or in a Path
Photoshop also offers the same capability to place type in and on a path.
The way you create path type in Photoshop is very similar to the way you
create path type in InDesign and Illustrator. Here’s how.
1. Grab the Pen or Shape tool. Choose the Paths option from the Options
bar and create your path.
Note that you can also copy and paste an existing path or import a path
from Illustrator or other compatible drawing program. 
2. With the regular Type tool (either Horizontal or Vertical), click on or
inside the path.
Your type cursor changes to indicate the path type. Note that if you are
filling a path with type, you see a bounding box appear.
3. Type your desired text and marvel at how the type glides along or
inside the path, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Commit the type by clicking the Commit button on the Options bar.
After you commit the type, the path itself doesn’t display unless you
stroke or fill it with color, as I did with my smaller heart.
4. To adjust the starting, or ending, point for the text, click either point
with the Path Selection tool and drag the type to a new position.
5. Edit the text (changing characters, colors, alignment, and so on) just
as you would with regular type.
6. Adjust the path by using any of the path tools — the Direct Selection
tool, the Convert Point tool, and so on.
The type magically reflows along the newly adjusted path.
To create regular point or paragraph type when clicking near a path, press
the Shift key when clicking, telling Photoshop you don’t want path type.

in the path of your choice.
Using the Options Bar
The Options bar contains a group of options, shown in Figure 3-4. Some
(but not all) of these options are duplicated in the Character palette. Those
options that appear in both places are the most frequently used options.
Talk about convenience.
Figure 3-4: The text options on the Options bar.
Your options, from left to right, include
 Change the Text Orientation: Use this handy button to toggle between
vertical and horizontal text orientations. Just select the type layer you
want to transform and click. This option works with point type and
paragraph type, although the results you get from switching the para-
graph type to vertical orientation may look odd.

Using the Options Bar
337
 Font Family: Select the font/typeface you want from the drop-down list. 
Photoshop provides us with a WYSIWYG font menu. You’ll notice that
after the font name, the word “sample” is rendered in the actual font.
You also find one of these abbreviations before the font name: a, Adobe
Type 1 (PostScript) fonts; TT (TrueType); O (OpenType). Those with no
abbreviations are Bit Mapped fonts.
 Font Style: Some fonts can have additional styles, such as light or demi-
bold, other styles are assigned as separate typefaces. Only the styles
available for a particular font appear in the list. You’ll notice that the
font style also now supports a WYSIWYG menu (that is, what you see is
what you get).
If a font you want to use doesn’t offer bold or italic styles, you can simu-
late either or both by choosing a faux style in the Character palette.
 Font Size: Choose the size of the text from this list, or type a size in the
text box. Generally, text sizes are shown in points, with 72 points equal-
ing approximately 1 inch. (A 36-point font is 1⁄2-inch in size at 72 ppi.)
If you don’t like points, you can switch to millimeters or pixels in the
Units and Rulers Preferences dialog box. (You can find instructions for
doing this in Book I, Chapter 5.) 
 Anti-aliasing: This list includes four different types of smoothing to use
on your text, plus none (which leaves your text unsmoothed). For small
type, try Sharp to avoid your type from being too fuzzy around the
edges. But the exact results depend on the typeface, so be sure and take
a gander at your type. Bonus Chapter 1 explains anti-aliasing in detail.
See the Introduction for details about the Web site.
 Text Alignment: Three buttons specify whether Photoshop aligns your
Horizontal Type tool text left, center, or right. When you use the Vertical
Type tool, the buttons transform into Top, Center (vertically), and
Bottom choices.
 Text Color: Click in this box to select a color from the Color Picker.
 Create Warped Text: This option lets you warp and bend text by using
15 different types of distortion.
 Toggle Character and Paragraph Palettes: Click this button any time
a type tool is active to show or hide the Character and Paragraph
palettes.
 Cancel: Click this button (or press the Esc key) to cancel the text entry
you’re making. 
 Commit: Click this button to apply the text to a type layer.

Working with the Character Palette
338
Working with the Character Palette
The Character palette, shown in
Figure 3-5, usually paired with the
Paragraph palette, which lets you
format the appearance of individual
type characters. Choose Window➪
Character, or click the Character
palette icon (capital letter A) in
the dock. Five of the options in the
Character palette are exactly the same
as those on the Options bar. The dupli-
cated features include font family, font
style, font size, anti-aliasing, text color.
The other menus, buttons, and text
boxes provide additional functions. I
discuss these options in the following
sections.
Leading
Leading is the amount of space between the baselines of consecutive lines
of type, usually measured in points. (The baseline is the imaginary line on
which a line of type rests.) You can choose a specific amount of leading or
allow Photoshop to determine the amount automatically by choosing Auto
from the Leading menu. 
Wider line spacing can make text easier to read (as long as you don’t go
overboard!) or can be used for artistic effect. Tighter line spacing makes
for more compact text but can decrease readability if your tightening goes
too far.
When you select Auto Leading, Photoshop multiplies the type size by a
value of 120 percent to calculate the leading size. So Photoshop spaces the
baselines of 10-point type 12 points apart. You can change this automatic
value by clicking the Paragraph palette and choosing Justify from the
palette’s menu. A dialog box appears with several values. Type the amount
you want in the Auto Leading box. If all this seems confusing, I recommend
experimenting with leading to get a true idea of how various values affect
the space between lines of text.
Tracking
Tracking is the amount of space between letters in a word or line or para-
graph. You can specify negative tracking to squeeze all the letters together
more closely, or positive tracking to let them spread out a bit.
Figure 3-5: The Character palette offers
type specification options galore.

Working with the Character Palette
339
Don’t confuse tracking with kerning, which deals with the space between
two individual letters. Tracking sets a value to evenly space all the letters
you select, and kerning helps you close or widen the gap between two indi-
vidual letters, officially called a letter pair.
One use for tracking is to help lines of text fit a specified horizontal space,
and you can make this technique work if you use it judiciously. Beginners
typically overdo tracking, squeezing letters together so tightly they touch,
or spreading them apart so that wide gaps appear. You can see examples of
tracking in Figure 3-6.
Figure 3-6: Tracking adjusts the spaces between your selected letters.
To track a set of characters or a line, select the text you want to squeeze or
expand, and either choose a value from 0 to –100, or 0 to 200, from the Track
menu, or type a specific value (from -1000 to 10000) in the Track text box.
Each unit is equal to 1⁄1,000 of an em (the width of an em dash in a particular
typeface), so a setting of –100 reduces the space between characters by 1⁄10
the width of an em dash (quite a lot!).
Kerning
Kerning is a technique for adding or
removing space between pairs of letters
to make them fit together more closely
and aesthetically. For example, the let-
ters A and V are a natural fit and often
look better when kerned slightly closer.
If you choose Metrics in your Kerning
option, Photoshop automatically tries
to kern the characters to provide an
attractive look, like that shown in
Figure 3-7. Note that the kerning tables
are built into the individual font. Be
warned that cheap fonts sometimes
have poorly created kerning tables or
no tables at all — another good reason
to stick with quality fonts.

Figure 3-7: Kerning a pair of letters can

Working with the Character Palette

To manually kern letters, click the point between the two characters and
either choose a percentage from 0 to –100, or 0 to 200, from the Kern menu,
or type a specific value (from -1000 to 10000) in the Kern text box. As with
the Track menu, the values represent 1⁄1,000 of an em.
Vertical and Horizontal Scale
The Vertical and Horizontal Scale options represent the relationship between
the height and width of the text. By default, this relationship is 100 percent.
To make the width of the type proportionately 50 percent more than the
height, you enter 150 percent into the Horizontal Scale box. You can see
examples of scaling in Figure 3-8.
Be careful about using the scale
options. Type designers create fonts
with very specific proportions. When
you deviate from those proportions,
you can destroy what was once a beau-
tifully designed typeface. 
Baseline shift and text attributes
The Baseline option adjusts the height above or below a typeface’s normal
baseline. You usually employ this option to create superscripts and sub-
scripts. A bar with several buttons in the Character palette lets you turn on
or off several type attributes with a single click. Table 3-1 covers the many
text attributes.
Table 3-1

What It Does
Faux Bold
Creates a fake bold. Warning: Applying faux styles can
distort the proportions of a font. It is really best to use
fonts as they were originally designed and if there is no
bold option, c’est la vie.
Faux Italic
Creates a fake italic. As with faux bold, take caution
when using to prevent distortion.
All Caps
Changes the case of the characters in selected text to
all capitals, or back to their normal case when you turn
it off.
Small Caps
Creates uppercase letters about the size of lowercase
letters in a font. Less obtrusive than full-size caps in
text passages. Photoshop either uses the small caps
characters built into many fonts or creates faux small
caps for you.

Icon
Name
What It Does
Superscript
Raises a character automatically to create a superscript,
as in E=MC2. You’ll probably also want to reduce the size
of the character.
Subscript
Lowers the character below the baseline, creating a
subscript. Usually, subscripts are reduced in size, as
in H2O.
Underline
Underlines the selected characters.
Strikethrough
Provides a strikethrough effect to the selected charac-
ters. In legal applications, strikethrough is widely used
to show sections that have been removed, but in their
original context.
Character Set
Selects the language you want to use for Photoshop’s
spell checker and for hyphenation. The option includes
variations, such as English: USA or English: UK, and
French or Canadian French.
You can also find the preceding attributes on the Character palette pop-up
menu. And the menu lists a few other attributes that are not displayed
directly in the palette:
 Change Text Orientation: Rotates your text horizontally or vertically.
 Standard Vertical Roman Alignment: Displays the text in the standard
alignment we are used to seeing — across the page.
 Open Type: When you work with OpenType fonts, you may find that
they include tables of various font attributes. These tables allow you to
apply various styles, such as true, diagonal fractions, alternate Old Style
numerals, fancy cursive type uppercase letters (Swash and Titling), liga-
tures (designed to fix the kerning of certain awkward letter combinations
such as fi and tt), and ornamental fonts (think dingbats or wingdings) such
as leaves and flowers.
 Fractional Widths: This setting is the default display. When type gets
small, the spacing between characters may vary by fractions of a pixel.
Photoshop has to favor one pixel or the other and sometimes the
appearance is strange. Overall, however, it provides the best spacing
for the legibility and appearance of the type. But, for small type to be
displayed on the Web, the readability may be impaired due to some
characters running together and words having gaps.
 System Layout: Displays the text using the operating system’s default
text handling, similar to what you see in WordPad or TextEdit. This
option doesn’t allow fractions of pixels and removes any anti-aliasing.
This is a good option for text to be displayed on the Web.

 No Break: Prevents words from breaking at the end of lines. You may
want to select this option to prevent words such as proper names,
dates, initials, and so forth from breaking. Select your text and then
choose the option.
 Reset Character: Choose this option to reset your character attributes
(font family, size, style, and so on) back to Photoshop’s default.
Working with the Paragraph Palette
You can use the Paragraph palette, shown in Figure 3-9, to format any or all
paragraphs in a type layer. Simply select the paragraph or paragraphs that
you want to format by clicking in an individual paragraph. You can drag a
selection to select multiple paragraphs; or click a type layer containing the
paragraphs to format all of them at once.
The Paragraph palette’s pop-up menu gives you access to Justification and
Hyphenation dialog boxes. You can use these to customize the default set-
tings Photoshop uses for these functions. As a side note, if you’re not famil-
iar with the word glyph used in the Justification dialog box, it is another
word for a font character.
Changing paragraph alignment
At the top of the Paragraph palette, you see a set of seven alignment buttons.
Three align nonjustified text. They include the following:
 Left Align Text: All text is even with the left margin and allowed to be
ragged on the right side of the column.
 Center Text: Text is evenly centered in its column and ragged on both
right and left edges.
 Right Align Text: All text is even with the right margin and allowed to
be ragged on the left side.
Figure 3-9: Use the Paragraph palette to align and indent your text.

Working with the Paragraph Palette
343
With vertical type, these choices align the text to the top, a center axis, and
the bottom of a column.
Changing paragraph justification
The other four options in the Paragraph palette produce justified text, in
which Photoshop inserts spaces between characters as necessary so each
line is flush on both left and right sides. The options apply only to the last line
of text in each paragraph. You can choose to make this last line flush left,
flush right, centered, or force justified on both sides with spaces inserted by
Photoshop. This last option sometimes calls for some manual tweaking to
avoid a final line that is squeezed or expanded too much. Note that you can
apply justification options to paragraph type only, not point type.
The “rules,” or criteria, Photoshop uses for creating justified text can be
found in the Justification dialog box accessible via the Paragraph palette
pop-up menu.
With vertical type, the justification choices are top aligns, center aligns,
bottom aligns, or force justifies the last line of text.
Changing paragraph indentation
The next three options in the Paragraph palette let you enter an amount of
indentation between the sides of the text bounding box and the actual text.
You can specify the amount of indentation from the left, right, and for the
first line of the paragraph (creating a first line that is indented more than
the others in the paragraph). For vertical type, the indentations are rotated
90 degrees.
Changing spacing between paragraphs
The next two options in the Paragraph palette let you specify the amount
of space between paragraphs. You can specify the amount of space before
every paragraph, the amount after every paragraph, or both.
Breaking long words across two lines
The final option in the Paragraph palette is the Hyphenate check box, which
specifies whether Photoshop hyphenates words that are too long to fit on a
line or leaves them intact. Turning on hyphenation can prevent awkward
spacing, particularly with justified text that would otherwise contain a lot
more spaces between characters to make a line fit.
The criteria Photoshop uses for creating hyphenated text can be found in the
Hyphenation dialog box accessible via the Paragraph palette pop-up menu.

The Paragraph palette’s pop-up menu has a few additional options:
 Roman Hanging Punctuation: Controls whether punctuation marks
(quotations, dashes, colons, and so on) appear inside or outside the mar-
gins. Select this option to have the punctuation marks appear outside.
 Adobe Single-line Composer: Composition includes using a host of
parameters, such as word and letter spacing and hyphenation to 
determine where a line should break. This option composes type one
line at a time and offers more manual control over where lines break.
The option favors compressing or expanding word spacing over
hyphenation, but prefers hyphenation over compressing or expanding
letter spacing. This is the default setting.
 Adobe Every-line Composer: Looks at multiple, possible breaking
points for a range of lines. The option can optimize earlier lines in the
paragraph to avoid weird breaks later on in the paragraph. Emphasis is
given to even spacing of letters and words over hyphenation. This option
can provide more even spacing and fewer hyphens.
 Reset Paragraph: Resets all the paragraph attributes back to the
Photoshop default.
Editing Text
You can apply all the options described in this chapter as you enter text,
or later, when you’re rearranging words or fixing typos and other errors.
To make changes to the text itself, just follow these steps:
1. Open a saved image or create a new Photoshop document.
2. Select the Type tool.
3. Select the type layer you want to modify, or click in the type in the
document.
4. You can begin typing at the place you clicked, backspace to eliminate
characters, or drag the mouse from the insertion point to select char-
acters to copy, delete, or format.
5. When you’re done entering your changes, click the Commit button.
Finding and replacing text
You can make global changes in a text layer, switching all occurrences of a
set of characters to another string. For example, you might have typed
Ghandi a few dozen times before remembering that the Mahatma’s name is
spelled Gandhi. To replace text, follow these steps:

1. Open a saved image or create a new Photoshop document.
2. Select the type layer you want to modify.
3. Choose Edit➪Find and

The Find and Replace Text
dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 3-10.
4. Type or paste the text you want to
replace in the Find What box.
5. Enter the replacement text in the
Change To box.
6. If you want the search to locate only text that exactly matches the
case of the Find string (that is FREEdom but not Freedom), choose the
Case Sensitive option.
7. To ignore the search word embedded in another word (say, to find
the but not there or they), choose Whole Word Only.
8. Click Find Next.
9. As each string is found, select whether you want to
• Change: This changes only the string of text just located. Click this
button if you are looking for one particular occurrence.
• Change All: This changes all occurrences of the search text with the
replacement string in your text.
• Change/Find: This changes the found text and then looks for the
next occurrence.
Checking your spelling
Photoshop can check your spelling by using an internal dictionary that you
can update with words of your own. Even though you’re not likely to enter
huge amounts of text in Photoshop, that’s no excuse for misspelling the
words that you do include. Indeed, because it’s so difficult to change text
after you’ve rasterized a text layer, the spell checker can save you a great
deal of work. Here’s how to use it:
1. Open a saved image or create a new Photoshop document.
2. Make sure that you’ve specified the correct language in the Character
palette’s language menu.
3. Select the text that you want to check, or select a type layer to check
all the text on that layer.

Masking, Shaping, and Warping Type
You can do a lot more with type than create labels, captions, or paragraphs
of text. Type can become an integral part of the decorative design, espe-
cially when you stylize, warp, or otherwise transform it in interesting ways.
Your Photoshop text can have character, too, communicating messages
with more than just words. The text of a beach scene can appear to be wavy
or watery and translucent. Halloween type can take on a ghostly or spooky
appearance. Type can be romantic, otherworldly, cheerful, or comical. It all
depends on how you create and apply it.
This chapter shows you some of the tricks you can perform by masking,
warping, and shaping your type so your words come to life and add some-
thing special to your images.
Playing with type layer opacity
Layers are the stacks of digital overlays on which each of the elements of
your image reside. (Check out Book V, Chapter 1 for the lowdown on layers.)
You can change the transparency of a type layer the same as you can with
any other layer in Photoshop, reducing the opacity (transparency) of the

Masking, Shaping, and Warping Type
347
type so it allows the underlying layer to show through. Take a look at
Figure 3-11, which shows type at varying levels of opacity over an image. 
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 3-11: Varying the opacity of your type is as easy as dragging a slider.
Changing the opacity of a type layer can
convey an idea of gradual visibility of words
onto an image. When working with opacity
in multiple layers of type, you can create a
sort of non-animated fade-in, each with a
greater opacity. Figure 3-12 shows an exam-
ple of this effect.
Another way to alter the transparency of
type is to use a layer mask. (Check out
Book VI, Chapter 3 for more information on
layer masks.) By using a layer mask, you can
customize your transparency with maximum
flexibility and still edit the text to change the
wording, font size, font, or anything else.
Simply apply a gradient or grab a brush and paint on the layer mask. I used
the fun Drippy Water Color Brush and painted on my layer mask, as shown
in Figure 3-13.
The first Putting-It-Together project in this chapter shows you another way
to use type opacity to create a ghostly effect.

Creating fade effects
To create a “fade out” image, just follow these steps:
1. Enter the words Fading out slowly (or other text of your choice)
into a new type layer.
You find out how to enter text earlier in this chapter.
2. Choose Layer➪Layer Mask➪Reveal All.
This creates a mask that can show or hide some of the layer. With Reveal
All selected, the layer defaults to showing everything on the layer with-
out hiding any of it.
3. Press D to make sure that Photoshop’s colors are the default black
and white.
4. Choose the Gradient tool from the Tools palette.
Or press Shift+G until it is active.
5. Select the Linear Gradient from the Options bar.
6. Click the Gradient Picker (down-pointing arrow) and choose the
Foreground to Background gradient. 
This is, by default the first one in the palette, unless you have changed
the defaults.
7. Click the layer mask’s icon in the Layers palette to make sure it is
active.
8. Click the right side of the type layer and drag to the left side.
Photoshop creates a gradient in the layer mask that is black on the
right and fades to white on the left, as shown in Figure 3-14. That means

Masking, Shaping, and Warping Type
349
the mask is most transparent on the left side (where the mask is white)
and least transparent on the right side (where the mask is black). It
reveals more of the original type on the left and fades it out on the right,
as you can see in the figure.

Ghosting Your Type
Need some ghostly, semitransparent type?
You can twist, transmogrify, and transform
your text by using Photoshop’s arsenal of
features. Create your type from scratch in
an empty document or add the type to an
existing picture or background. (You can
find my example image on this book’s Web
site.) For the heck of it, these steps show
you how to add ghostly writing to an exist-
ing image. Just follow these steps:
1. Open the background image you want
to overlay with the ghost type.
Any image, ectoplasmic or not, will do.

2. Choose the color you want to use for your text from the Swatches palette.
Black or orange are good Halloween colors, but you can use any contrasting color.
You can also sample a color from your image with the Eyedropper tool. Simply click
your desired color and it then becomes your new foreground color.
3. Choose the Horizontal Type tool from the Tools palette and then click the area
where you want to add the text.
The vertical cursor that appears is the same size that the text will be.
4. Choose a font, style, and size from the drop-down list on the Options bar.
5. Select an anti-aliasing method to help smooth the edges of your type.
Anti-aliasing, which I cover earlier in this chapter, softens a hard edge by adding
partially transparent pixels.
6. Type your text.
The text appears on top of the background.
7. Click the Commit button (the check icon) on the Options bar to insert the text
you’ve typed into a layer of its own.
8. To change the opacity of the type, adjust the Opacity setting in the Layers palette.
To make additional changes to the text, use a filter. For example, if you want to make
the text wavy, use the Wave filter on the Filter➪Distort menu. Or you can use other
filters from the array discussed in Book VII. Just remember, when you do a warning
pops up, informing you that the type layer must be rasterized (converted from
editable text to pixels) first. Click OK and you’re on your way.
9. When you’re satisfied with the look, save your image for additional editing later, or
choose Layer➪Flatten Image to combine the text and background.

Creating type outlines
In addition to its Vertical and Horizontal Type tools (discussed earlier in this
chapter), Photoshop includes Vertical and Horizontal Type Mask tools.
These function almost identically to their conventional counterparts, with
one important exception: Type mask tools don’t create a new layer. Instead,
they create a selection within the currently active layer, like the one shown
in Figure 3-15.
Figure 3-15: Type mask tools create selection marquees from your letter shapes.
Book IV

You can treat the selections created with the type mask tools just as you
can any other selection. Try the following:
 Move type mask selections around your document when any of the
selection tools are active.
 Store type selections as alpha channels by choosing Select➪Save
Selection. I introduce selections in Book III, Chapter 3. You can find out
how to save selections in Book VI, Chapter 1.
 Skew type selections (or change them in some other way) by using
Select➪Transform. You can find more information on transforming
selections in Book III, Chapter 3.
 Convert a selection into an editable path, as described in “Transforming
type into vector shapes and paths,” later in this chapter.
 Use the selection to cut or copy portions of an image in text-shaped
chunks, as shown in Figure 3-16. You can find out how this last sugges-
tion works by following the steps in the Putting-It-Together project at
the end of this chapter, in which you find out how to literally carve your
words in stone.

Figure 3-16: Use a type mask to create type from an image.
Rasterizing your type layer
The Type tool creates editable type layers. You can change the wording,
spacing, font, font size, and other factors as much as you want, as long as
the type remains in a type layer.
However, after you make all the changes you want, you may need to convert
your type layer to pixels in the form of rasterized type. After they’re raster-
ized, you can apply filters, paint on the type, and apply gradients and pat-
terns. Rasterizing type layers allows you to merge the type with other pixels
in your image and, eventually, flatten the image to create a finished docu-
ment suitable for use with other programs.

Masking, Shaping, and Warping Type
353
After you convert your type to pixels, you can no longer edit the type. Nor
can you resize the text without risking jaggies. You want to rasterize your
type only when you’re certain you won’t need to edit or resize it. Make a
copy of the type layer before you rasterize it and toggle off the visibility of
the copy, and make sure you save an unflattened copy of the document with
all layers intact. That way if you need to edit the type, you have the layered
file with the unrasterized text. For more on layers, see Book V. 
To rasterize your type, select the type layer that you want to convert to
pixels. Then choose Layer➪Rasterize➪Type. The type is shown in the
Layers palette on a transparent background.
Transforming type into vector shapes and paths
By default, regular type created with the Type tool is vector-based type, not
bitmapped, rasterized type. But you can also convert regular type (each
character) to individual vector shapes. The individual characters then
become shapes defined by vector masks. You can edit the shapes like any
shapes created with the shape tools, by manipulating anchor points and
straight and curved segments. See Book IV, Chapter 1 for the lowdown on
shapes. And you can also convert regular type to work paths where each
character becomes a path, editable like any other path with the selection
arrows and pen tools. Type is usually converted into a path in order to
create a clipping path based on the type (see Book III, Chapter 2). For more
on paths, see Book III, Chapter 2.
Book IV
Chapter 3
Creating and 
Editing Type
Rasterizing type the other way
In addition to rasterizing a type layer in the usual
way, you can also rasterize it by merging it with
a non-type layer. For example, if your type layer
appears immediately above a text layer that has
already been rasterized, you can merge the
layers by pressing Ctrl+E (Ô+E on the Mac).
You may also come across the opportunity to ras-
terize a type layer because Photoshop reminds
you to. Some commands, particularly filters,
operate only on pixels. When you try to use
them, you may see a warning dialog box. Often,
the dialog box includes an option for immedi-
ately converting the type layer to raster form.

Masking, Shaping, and Warping Type
354
So again, you can convert regular nonrasterized vector type to Photoshop
line/curve-oriented shapes in the form of a vector mask or work path. You
convert type to vector shapes and paths in order to edit it with the pen
tools. Here are the ways to do that:
 To convert type to an editable work path, choose Layer➪Type➪Create
Work Path.
 To convert type to shapes, choose Layer➪Type➪Convert to Shape.
Here are the chief things to know about type converted into a shape or path:
 Like type layers, you can resize it without producing jagged diagonal
lines.
 You can edit the shape of the char-
acters, but you cannot edit the text
itself, as shown in Figure 3-17.
 You must rasterize the converted
type before you can merge it with
pixel-based layers or apply special
effects with filters. You can apply
layer styles to any kind of type, how-
ever. Be sure to check out Book V,
Chapter 4 for all you need to know
about layer styles.
 If you have converted your type into
a shape, it becomes a vector mask
exactly like other vector masks in
Photoshop, and you can edit the
shape of the characters by using the
pen tools. You can find detailed infor-
mation on editing vector masks in Book VI, Chapter 1.
Wreaking havoc on your type
Photoshop’s great automated Warp feature can twist your type in pre-
dictable ways that are not only repeatable but, thanks to the controls in
their dialog boxes, customizable as well. The cool part is that even though
type has been warped, it remains fully editable until you rasterize it. All you
need to do to warp your text is click the Warp icon on the Options bar.
This opens the multifaceted Warp Text dialog box, shown in Figure 3-18.
Figure 3-17: Converting your type to a
path allows you to alter the shape of the
letters.

Masking, Shaping, and Warping Type
355
Figure 3-18: Choose from a number of warp styles.
Web developers take note: You cannot
warp text that has a faux bold style
applied (found in the Character palette).
You find a whole list of special effects,
such as Arc, Arch, Bulge, Flag, Wave, Fish,
Fisheye, and Twist. Each of these effects
provides a special look to your type, as
shown in Figure 3-19.
Each effect has a dialog box of its own
that allows you to set the parameters for the amount, direction, degree of
distortion, amount of bend, and so forth. You can watch your type warp
right on-screen and tailor the distortion as you like. You can apply most
asymmetrical warp effects to type in either horizontal or vertical directions.
Fisheye, Inflate, and Twist are among those that can’t be rotated, because
their effects are already oriented in horizontal and vertical directions that
you can control with sliders.

Carving Your Type in Stone
You can use the Type tool to create selec-
tions shaped like text and then use images
themselves as textures for the type. For
example, if you were creating a floral-
themed Web page, you could use pictures of
flowers as the fill for your text. A type selec-
tion can cut out any part of a picture for use
any way you want.
Follow these steps to carve letters into a stone texture image:
1. Open the stone texture image you want to use.
I’m using a sandstone wall, but you can use other kinds of stone, wood, or any tex-
ture that interests you. Best of all, the embossed look that results is only one of
many different looks you can achieve simply by making small changes in the Layer
style that you apply to the text.
2. Choose the Horizontal Type Mask tool from the Tools palette and then click in the
area where you want to enter your text.
3. Choose the font, font style, font size, and other text parameters from the drop-down
lists on the Options bar.
4. Enter the text you want to use onto the texture you’ve chosen. Then click the
Commit button (check mark icon) on the Options bar to set your text.
The selection in the shape of the text appears where you typed the text.
5. Press Ctrl+C (Ô+C on the Mac) to copy the selected area of your chosen texture
(the brick in the shape of the text in my example), and then press Ctrl+V (Ô+V on
the Mac) to paste a text-shaped section of that texture in a layer of its own.
The text blends in with what’s in the background layer (in my example, the stone)
and is invisible (for now).
6. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Bevel and Emboss to open the Layer Style dialog box.
In the Layer Style dialog box, you find dozens of different effects that you can
create.

7. Experiment with the settings in the Layer Style dialog box to try out different looks
and to achieve various effects.
 Choose the kind of beveling or embossing you want from the Style and
Technique drop-down lists in the Structure area.
I choose Inner Bevel and Chisel Hard to produce a dramatic, hard-edged
embossing effect.
 Move the Depth slider to the right to increase the depth of the bevel.
I set the value at 500% for a raised effect. A lower value produces a less 3-D
effect, while a higher value produces a more drastic 3-D effect.
 Select the Contour check box on the left side for an even more pronounced 
3-D look.
 In the Shading area, you can adjust controls that allow you to change the
apparent angle of the illumination that produces the bevel’s shadow.
I moved the angle to 95 degrees (roughly straight overhead), but I left the other
controls alone.
You can find details about how to use the other options in the Layer Style dialog box
in Book V, Chapter 4.
8. Click OK to apply the effects that you’ve chosen.
9. As a last touch, choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels to darken the text layer to
make it stand out even more distinctly from the background.
For more info on how to use the Levels adjustment see Book VIII, Chapter 1.

Working with
Layers

L
ayers are like modern appliances. Sure, you
could live without a microwave, a dishwasher,
and a vacuum cleaner, but cooking and cleaning
would take a lot longer, and it wouldn’t be nearly
as convenient. Layers give Photoshop users the
ultimate in editing ﬂexibility. This in turn saves
production time, giving you more time to let your
creative juices ﬂow. 
In this book, I give you information about how to
create and edit layers. You see how to take multi-
ple images and create single composite images.
I also cover how to manage your layers by using
layer sets and layer comps. And you ﬁnd out how
to enhance your layers by using adjustment
layers, layer styles, blend modes, and various
opacity settings. Finally, you’ll want to check out
the chapter on the Smart Objects. Beefed up even
more in Photoshop CS3, these intelligent objects
allow you to transform elements indeﬁnitely with-
out loss of quality.

P
eople are often surprised and even downright shocked when I tell them
that pretty much everything they can do with layers they can also do
without them. Not using layers would be more technically challenging and a
heck of a lot more tedious, but you could still get the job done.
The benefit to using layers is that you have tremendous 
flexibility. The changes you make to the pixels on the
individual layers are permanent, but the interaction
between the pixels on different layers is dynamic.
You can make endless edits as long as those layers
exist. Layers make working in Photoshop a lot
more forgiving, allowing you to make changes
quickly and productively.
But hey, it’s not just the technical and practical
aspects that make layers so wonderful. Layers also
allow you to express your creative side, composit-
ing several images into one, with just a drag of the
mouse. The only downside to layers is that each one
makes your file size grow and therefore can start to slow
your system performance. And you can save layers in only a
few file formats. But the downsides are a small price to pay for
something that makes your image-editing life so much easier.

Getting to Know the Layers Palette
362
Getting to Know the Layers Palette
In terms of a real-world analogy, think of layers as sheets of acetate, similar
to those clear plastic sheets used with overhead projectors. You draw differ-
ent elements on the various sheets. What you draw on one sheet doesn’t
affect the other sheets. You can show just one sheet, or you can stack several
on top of one another to create a combination image. You can reshuffle the
order of the sheets, add new sheets, or delete old sheets. Any space on the
sheet that doesn’t have a mark on it is clear, or transparent.
That’s how layers work in Photoshop. You can place elements on separate
layers, yet show them together to create a combination image, or composite.
You can also add, delete, or rearrange layers. And unlike sheets of acetate,
you can adjust how opaque or transparent the element on the layer is, as
well as change the way the colors between layers interact (blend modes).
Just as with every other important aspect of Photoshop, the program houses
layers in a single location, called a palette. It’s time to formally meet the pow-
erful palette that controls the operations of layers. To display the Layers
palette, shown in Figure 1-1, choose Window➪Layers or, easier yet, press F7.
Figure 1-1: Layers give you tremendous editing flexibility.

Getting to Know the Layers Palette

The order of the layers in the Layers palette represents the order in the
image. The top layer in the palette is the top layer in your image, and so on.
For some tasks you can work on only one layer at a time. For other tasks,
you can work on multiple layers simultaneously.
Here’s the lowdown on how to work with the Layers palette:
 Select a layer: Simply click its name or thumbnail. Photoshop then high-
lights the active layer.
 Select multiple contiguous layers: Click your first layer and then
Shift+click your last layer.
 Select multiple non-contiguous layers: Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac)
your desired layers.
 Select all layers: Choose Select➪All Layers.
 Select layers of similar type: Select a layer and then choose Select➪
Similar Layers.
 Deselect all layers: Choose Select➪Deselect Layers or click in the area
below the bottom layer or background.
 Select the actual element (the non-transparent pixels) on the layer:
Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) the layer’s thumbnail in the palette.
If you forget this handy shortcut, you can also choose Select➪Load
Selection. Make sure that the layer name that appears in the Channel
pop-up menu is [layer name] Transparency and click OK.
 Create an adjustment or fill layer: Click the Create a New Fill or
Adjustment Layer icon at the bottom of the palette. See “Introducing
Different Types of Layers,” later in this chapter, for more on these
layers.
 Duplicate an existing layer: Drag the layer to the Create a New Layer
icon at the bottom of the palette. See the next section for more on creat-
ing layers.
 Rename a layer: When you create a new layer, Photoshop provides
default layer names (Layer 1, Layer 2, and so on). If you want to rename
a layer, simply double-click the layer name (the name not the thumb-
nail) in the Layers palette and enter the name directly in the Layers
palette. While it may seem tedious to give your layers meaningful
names, it can be helpful in your productivity, especially as the number
of layers in your file starts to increase.This renaming shortcut works
throughout Photoshop (the Channels palette, the Paths palette, and so
on). You can also select the layer and choose Layer Properties from the
Layers palette options menu or choose Layer➪Layer Properties.
Book V
Chapter 1
Creating Layers

Looking at the Background and Layers
364
 Determine what layer holds the element you want to edit: Select the
Move tool and Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) the element. Photoshop
automatically activates the appropriate layer. Or you can right-click
(Control+click on the Mac) the element. A context menu appears, telling
you what layer the element resides on, and then enables you to select
that layer.
You can use the keyboard shortcut Alt+] (right bracket) (Option+] on
the Mac) to move up one layer; Alt+[ (left bracket) (Option+[ on the Mac)
to activate the next layer down. Press Shift+Alt+] (Shift+Option+] on
the Mac) to move to the top layer; press Shift+Alt+[ (Shift+Option+[
on the Mac) to move to the background or bottom layer.
 Adjust the interaction between colors on layers and adjust the trans-
parency of layers: You can use the blend modes and the opacity and fill
options at the top of the palette to mix the colors between layers and
adjust the transparency of the layers. For details, see Book V, Chapter 3.
 Delete a layer: Drag it to the trash icon at the bottom of the Layers
palette. You can also choose Layer➪Delete➪Layer or choose Delete
Layer from the palette options menu.
 Change the size of the layer thumbnails: Choose Palette Options from
the palette menu and select a thumbnail size. You can also choose
whether to display just the boundary of the layer contents or the whole
document in the thumbnail.
The remaining icons at the bottom of the Layers palette allow you to link
layers, create layer styles, layer masks, and layers groups, all of which war-
rant sections of their own. See Book V, Chapter 4 for more on layer styles
and Chapter 2 for more on layer sets. Check out Book VI, Chapter 3 for more
on layer masks.
The preceding list represents just the tip of the iceberg. You can also view
and hide layers, link, lock, color-code, rearrange, merge, flatten, and ani-
mate layers. Book V, Chapter 2 covers most topics in detail. 
Looking at the Background and Layers
When you create a new image with white or background colored contents,
scan an image into Photoshop, or open a file from a stock photography CD
or your own digital camera, you basically have a file with just a background.
An image contains only one background, and you can’t do much to it
besides paint on it and make basic adjustments. You can’t rearrange the
background in the stack of layers — it’s always on the very bottom of the
Layers palette. You can’t change the opacity, or blend mode of a back-
ground either. What you can do is convert a background to a layer, and then
the world’s at your feet.

Looking at the Background and Layers
365
To convert a background into a layer, follow these steps:
1. Double-click Background in the Layers palette.
In addition, you can choose Layer➪New➪Layer from Background. Note
that the name Background is italicized in the Layers palette, as shown in
Figure 1-2.
PhotoSpin
Figure 1-2: A newly opened image in Photoshop contains only a background.
2. Name the layer or leave it at the default name of Layer 0.
You can also color-code your layer by choosing Layer Properties from
the palette pop-up menu. All this does is make your layer stand out
more noticeably in the Layers palette.

3. Click OK.
Photoshop converts your back-
ground into a layer, as indicated in
the Layers palette. Note that the
layer name is no longer italicized,
as shown in Figure 1-3.
When you create a new image with
transparent contents, the image
doesn’t contain a background but
instead is created with a single
layer. You can also convert a layer
into a background by selecting it
and then choosing Layer➪New➪
Background from Layer. Note that
this option is available only when
no background exists.
Introducing Different Types of Layers
Although turning the background into a layer (discussed in the previous
section) is a popular activity, Photoshop refers to layers in the plural for a
reason. Image editing would be no fun if you didn’t have a variety of differ-
ent layers to mess around with. 
Photoshop Standard offers five types of layers (Extended gives you two
more — Video and 3D). Four of the five have very specific purposes in the
life of your image. Some you may never use, and some you’ll use only occa-
sionally. But the vanilla-flavored type, which you’ll use the most, is simply
called a layer. Read on to find out more.
Using plain vanilla layers
The regular layer is the one that most closely matches the acetate analogy.
You put various elements on separate layers to create a composite image. You
can create blank layers and add images to them, or you can create layers from
images themselves. You can create as many layers as your computer’s RAM
lets you. And sometimes layers are created automatically by a specific action.
Because each layer in an image is a separate entity, you can edit, paint,
transform, mask, or apply a filter on a layer without affecting the other
layers. And once an element is on a layer, you no longer have to make a
selection (get the selection outline) to select it — you simply drag the 
element with the Move tool. The element freely floats in a sea of transparency.
Because showing “clear” areas or transparency is impossible on a computer
monitor, Photoshop uses a gray-and-white checkerboard, by default, to rep-
resent the transparent areas of a layer.
Figure 1-3: Double-click the background
to convert it into a layer.

Because you’ll work with regular layers on a daily basis, I spend the majority
of Book V discussing them.
Using adjustment layers
An adjustment layer is a special kind of layer used mostly for color correc-
tion. What’s great about adjustment layers is that you can apply that color
correction without permanently affecting any of your layers. Adjustment
layers apply the correction to all the layers below them, without affecting
any of the layers above them.
Because the color correction actually resides on a layer, you can edit,
delete, duplicate, merge, or rearrange the adjustment layer at any time.
You have more flexibility in your image-editing chores and more freedom
for experimentation. In addition, none of this experimentation harms your
image because it takes place above the image on an adjustment layer.
Photoshop has 14 kinds of adjustment layers, and you can use as many as
your heart desires. The adjustments offered are the same adjustments you
find on the Image➪Adjustments menu. For specifics on each adjustment and
what it corrects, see Book VIII, Chapter 1. Here’s how to create an adjust-
ment layer:
1. Open an image of your choice.
Because you’re applying an adjustment layer, you may want to use an
image that is in need of some color correction. In the case of adjustment
layers, you don’t need to convert your background into a layer. I chose
an image that was oversaturated.
2. Choose Layer➪New Adjustment Layer. From the submenu, choose
your desired adjustment. Name the layer if you want, leave the other
options at their defaults, and click OK.
For my example, I chose Hue/Saturation.
Book V
Chapter 1
Creating Layers
Playing around with layer masks
A layer mask is like a second sheet of acetate
that hovers over a layer. You can use layer
masks with regular layers, adjustment layers, fill
layers and Smart Filters. For example, you may
paint on a layer mask (typically with black,
white, and various shades of gray) to selectively
hide or display an adjustment (or an image on a
regular layer). Any black areas on the mask hide
the adjustment, any white areas show the
adjustment, and anything in between (gray) par-
tially shows the adjustment. I cover layer masks
in detail in Book VI, Chapter 3.

Introducing Different Types of Layers
368
You can also just click the Create a New Fill or Adjustment Layer icon
(the black and white circle icon) at the bottom of the Layers palette and
choose an adjustment from the pop-up menu.
The dialog box pertaining to your adjustment appears.
3. Make the necessary corrections and click OK.
After you close the dialog box, the adjustment layer appears in the
Layers palette, shown in Figure 1-4. The adjustment layer icon and a
thumbnail appear on the adjustment layer. The thumbnail represents a
layer mask. For more on layer masks, check out the “Playing around
with layer masks” sidebar in this chapter.
In my example, the layer mask is all white, so my adjustment shows up
full strength over my entire image. Note that you can also apply an
adjustment layer to a selected portion of your image. Like regular
layers, you can adjust the opacity, fill, and blend modes of an adjust-
ment layer. For more on these options, see Book V, Chapter 3.
If you want to view your image without the adjustment, click the eye
icon in the left column of the Layers palette to hide the adjustment
layer. You can find more on viewing layers in Book V, Chapter 2. If you
want to delete the adjustment layer, simply drag it to the trash icon in
the Layers palette or choose Delete from the Layer menu or Layers
palette options menu.

Editing adjustment layers
After you create an adjustment layer, you can easily edit it. Simply double-
click the adjustment layer icon in the Layers palette or choose Layer➪
Layer Content Options. In the dialog box that appears, make any edits and
then click OK. The only adjustment layer that you cannot edit is the Invert
adjustment. It is either totally on or totally off.
To change the content of an adjustment layer, choose Layer➪Change Layer
Content and select a different adjustment layer from the submenu. Editing
and changing the content works the exact same way for fill layers (which I
discuss in the next section).
Isolating your adjustments
If you don’t use an adjustment layer when you make color corrections, the
correction you apply affects only the active layer (the layer highlighted in
the Layers palette). This may be the way to go if you want to just tweak the
color on a single layer.
Here are some tips for using and isolating adjustment layers:
 Correct part (but not all) of a layer: To enable the adjustment layer to
correct only a portion of a layer, make a selection before you create
the adjustment layer. The adjustment affects only the pixels within the
selection outline.
This is referring to the pixels within the selection outline on each layer
that resides below the adjustment layer. In addition to making a selection,
you can also create and select a closed path (see Book III, Chapter 2 for
more on paths).
Another way to correct part of a layer is to paint on the adjustment
layer mask. Painting with black will hide the adjustment, painting with
various levels of gray will partially hide the adjustment. For more on
layer masks, see Book VI, Chapter 3.
 Create a clipping group: When you create a clipping group of the
layers you want to adjust, you can place the adjustment layer in or
at the bottom of the clipping group, and it affects only those clipped
layers. In a clipping group, the bottommost layer acts as a mask for
the layers in the group. For more on clipping groups, see Book V,
Chapter 4.
 Create a layer group: You can create a layer group (described in Book V,
Chapter 2) and place the layers you want adjusted in that group. Then
make sure that the blend mode is set to any mode except Pass Through.
For more on modes, see Book V, Chapter 3.

Taking advantage of fill layers
A fill layer lets you add a layer of solid color, a gradient, or a pattern. Like
adjustment layers, fill layers also have layer masks, as indicated by the
mask icon thumbnail in the Layers palette.
You can create as many fill layers as you like, just as you can with regular
layers and adjustment layers. You can also edit, rearrange, duplicate,
delete, and merge fill layers. And you can blend fill layers with other
layers by using the opacity, fill, and blend mode options in the Layers
palette.
Like an adjustment layer, to confine the effects of a fill layer to a portion
of the image, make a selection or create and select a closed path before
you create the fill layer (see Book III, Chapter 2 for more on paths).
And editing or changing the contents of a fill layer is similar to editing or
changing the contents of an adjustment layer (see the preceding section
for details).
Here’s how to create a fill layer:
1. Open an image of your choice.
In this case, open an image that would look good with a border or text.
For my example, I created the word fujiyama by using the Horizontal
Type Mask tool (for details, see Book IV, Chapter 3). If you don’t have an
active selection, the fill layer encompasses your entire canvas.
2. Choose Layer➪New Fill Layer. From the submenu, choose your
desired adjustment. Name the layer, leave the other options at their
defaults, and click OK.
For my example, I chose Pattern from the submenu.
You can also just click the Create a New Fill or Adjustment Layer 
icon at the bottom of the Layers palette and choose a fill from the 
pop-up menu.
3. Follow the steps that correspond with the option you chose in Step 2:
 Solid Color: Choose your desired color from the Photoshop Color
Picker. (For more on color, see Book II, Chapter 3.)
 Gradient: Choose a preset gradient from the pop-up palette or click
the gradient preview to display the Gradient Editor to create your
own gradient. Set additional gradient options as desired. (For gradi-
ent details, see Book IV, Chapter 2.)

Introducing Different Types of Layers
371
 Pattern: Select a pattern from the pop-up palette. Click Scale and enter
a value or drag the scale slider. I scaled my Crayon on Vellum pattern
120%, as shown in Figure 1-5.
Click Snap to Origin to position
the origin of the pattern with
the document window. Finally,
select the Link with Layer
option to specify that the pat-
tern moves with the fill layer if
you move it. I chose Pattern in
my example in Figure 1-5.
4. Click OK.
After you close the dialog box, the fill layer appears in the Layers
palette, as shown in Figure 1-6. Similar to adjustment layers, you’ll
notice the layer mask that was created on the fill layer. In my example,
the word fujiyama appears white on the layer mask, thereby allowing
my pattern to show through. The remaining areas are black, hiding my
pattern. I added a couple of layer styles (Drop Shadow and Inner Bevel)
to my type to jazz it up a bit. If you want to do the same, jump ahead to
Book V, Chapter 4.
If you want to delete the fill layer, do one of three things: Drag it to the
trash icon in the Layers palette; choose Delete from the Layer menu; or
choose Delete Layer from the Layers palette options menu.
Figure 1-6: Your chosen fill shows through your selected areas.

Introducing Different Types of Layers
372
One final note. You can also rasterize a fill layer to convert it to a regular
raster image. Choose Layer➪Rasterize➪Fill Content. A raster image enables
you to use painting tools or filters on the layer.
Making use of shape layers
Believe or not, Photoshop isn’t just about photos and painting. It also has
a whole slew of shape drawing tools — six to be exact. You can fill those
shapes with solid color, gradients, or patterns. When you create a shape, it
resides on its own unique shape layer. A shape layer contains a vector mask,
similar in concept to the adjustment layer mask described earlier.
If you look at the Layers palette, you can see that the Shape layer has two
thumbnails: One is entirely filled with color, and the other contains the path
of the shape, as shown in Figure 1-7. To state it simply, the color is peeking
through the path of the shape, and the rest of the layer is hidden or masked.
The paths that comprise a shape are vector paths; when printed, they retain
their smooth curves without the jagged edges you often see from bitmap
editing programs. Although you can edit, move, and transform shapes, your
ability to edit shape layers is limited. To apply filters and other special effects,
you must first rasterize the shape layers — that is, convert the vector paths
to pixels. For more details on shapes, see Book IV, Chapter 2.
Figure 1-7: On a shape layer, color peeks through a path and is hidden everywhere else.

Using type layers
To create type, such as the type shown in Figure 1-8,
click your canvas with the Type tool (horizontal
or vertical) and type your desired text. After you
commit your text by pressing Enter on the numeric
keypad or clicking the Commit button on the
Options bar (it looks like a check mark), you’ve cre-
ated a type layer. In the Layers palette, you see a
layer with a T icon, indicating that it’s a type layer.
Initially, the name of the type layer corresponds to
the text you typed (you can change the layer name
if you like). Like shapes, the text in Photoshop is
true vector type and, if left in that format, always
prints smooth and without the jaggies.
Another great thing about type in Photoshop is that
it is live; you can edit the text at any time. You can
also change the orientation, apply anti-aliasing
(softening of the edges), create paths from the type, and even warp it into
various distortions. You can also convert the type to a shape. And like regu-
lar layers, you can move, rearrange, copy, and change the layer options
(opacity, fill, and mode) of a type layer. If, however, you want to apply certain
special effects, such as filters, you must first rasterize (convert into pixels)
the text. For everything you need to know about type, see Book IV, Chapter 3.
Making Layers
As I mention earlier in the chapter, good, old-fashioned, regular layers are
the backbone of the world of layers. The next few sections take a look at the
various ways to create these layers.
Creating a new layer
If you want to create a new blank layer, click the Create a New Layer icon at
the bottom of the Layers palette. You can also create a new layer by choos-
ing New Layer from the palette menu or by choosing Layer➪New➪Layer.
The latter method prompts you with a dialog box to name your layer and
includes other options for grouping, color-coding, blending, and opacity
(all of which I explain in other chapters in Book V). Provide a name for your
layer and click OK. If you chose one of the first two methods, a layer with
the default name of Layer 1 appears in the Layers palette.
You can also create an entirely new document with a layer by choosing
File➪New. In the New dialog box, select the Transparent for the Background
Contents option. Your new file then appears with Layer 1 instead of a 
background.
Book V
Chapter 1
Creating Layers
Figure 1-8: Type layers
automatically appear when
you create and commit type.

Making Layers
374
When you click the Create a New Layer icon, the layer is added above your
active layer. By pressing the Ctrl key (Ô on the Mac) when you click,
Photoshop adds the new layer below the active layer.
Your new transparent layer is now ready for content. You can put content
on the new layer several ways:
 Use one of the painting tools and paint directly on the layer.
 Make a selection on another layer or the background (for the difference
between the two, see the previous sections in this chapter) within the
same document or from another image entirely and then choose Edit➪
Copy. Select your new blank layer in the Layers palette and then choose
Edit➪Paste.
 Make a selection on another layer (or the background) within the same
document or from another image and then choose Edit➪Cut. Select
your new blank layer and then choose Edit➪Paste. Just remember that
Photoshop deletes the selection from the source and adds it to your
new layer, as shown in Figure 1-9.
 Transfer an entire image to your new layer by choosing Select➪All and
then either Edit➪Copy or Edit➪Cut. Select your new blank layer and then
choose Edit➪Paste.
Using Layer via Copy and Layer via Cut
Another way to create a layer is to use the Layer via Copy command on the
Layer menu. Make a selection on a layer or background and choose Layer➪
New➪Layer via Copy. The copied selection is placed on a new layer with the
default name of Layer 1. You can do the same with the Layer via Cut com-
mand, but in this case, Photoshop deletes the selected area from the source
layer or background and places it on the new layer. The source layer is left
with a gaping transparent hole (refer to Figure 1-9). If you used the background
for the source, your background color fills the space. Remember that you
can use these two commands only within the same image. You cannot use
them between multiple images.
Duplicating layers
If you want to duplicate an existing layer, first select it in the Layers palette.
Then drag the layer to the Create a New Layer icon at the bottom of the
palette. You can also duplicate a layer by choosing Duplicate Layer from the
palette options menu or by choosing Layer➪Duplicate Layer. Like with cre-
ating a new layer, the latter method prompts you with a dialog box to name
your layer and includes other options. Provide a name for your layer and
click OK. If you chose either of the first two methods, Photoshop provides
the default name of the original layer with Copy appended to the name.
Duplicating layers can be especially handy when you want to experiment
with a special effect but don’t want to harm your original image.

Compositing with Multiple Images
375
Figure 1-9: Cutting and pasting a selection from one layer to another leaves a transparent hole
on the original layer.
Compositing with Multiple Images
Often when working with layers, you are not confined to using a single image.
I mean, you can do only so much to that family portrait taken down at the local
photo studio. But take your family and put them in front of the ruins at Machu
Picchu or the summit at Mount Everest (you can even add faux snow with a
technique shown in Book VII), and you have endless hours of fun. When you get
the hang of working with several images, you’ll find that it opens a whole new
door of creative possibilities. And you’re not limited to just plain old snapshots.
You can incorporate type, vector illustrations, and scans of just about anything
you can place on a scanning bed. Apply some layer styles, maybe a filter or
two (see Book VII), and you have an image worthy of some major wall space.
Book V

Copying and pasting images
Earlier in the “Making Layers” section, I explain how to use the Copy, Cut,
and Paste commands within the same image or between two different
images when you want to fill a new blank layer with content. You can also
use the Copy and Paste commands without having a blank layer first.
When you copy and paste a selection without a blank layer, Photoshop
automatically creates a new layer from the pasted selection. You can go
about your merry way and perform all your layer creations by using only
those commands. However, I rarely use them when working with multiple
images. I prefer the drag-and-drop method, which I describe next.
The Copy Merged command on the Edit menu creates a merged copy of all
the visible layers within the selection.
Dragging and dropping layers
To copy an entire layer from one document to another, simply select the
layer in the Layers palette, grab the Move tool, and drag and drop that layer
onto your destination document. Photoshop automatically introduces the
dropped layer as a new layer above the active layer in the image. You don’t
need to have a selection outline to copy the entire layer. However, if you
want to copy just a portion of the layer, make your desired selection, as
Bypassing the clipboard
Yes, you can always cut and paste or copy and
paste a layer from one image to another, but I
prefer to drag and drop rather than copy and
paste between two images. By dragging and
dropping, you bypass the temporary storage
area for copied and stored data, the clipboard.
(Whenever you copy or cut a selection,
Photoshop stores the selection on the clipboard
until you are ready to paste it to its new home.)
So what’s wrong with that? Well, nothing,
unless you’re working with high-resolution
images. Storing images on the clipboard, even
on a temporary basis, can slow down your
system. Keeping your clipboard clear of data
ensures that Photoshop is running lean and mean
so that you can drag and drop more images,
selections, and layers, quicker and more effi-
ciently. If you want to hold a little spring clean-
ing on your clipboard, you can always choose
Edit➪Purge➪Clipboard, which empties your
clipboard of any stored data. Take my advice and
try the drag-and-drop method. I guarantee that,
like me, you’ll be flexing your trigger finger —
all the better to drag and drop even faster.

Compositing with Multiple Images

shown in Figure 1-10, before you drag and drop with the Move tool. If you
want the selected element to be centered on the destination image, press
the Shift key as you drag and drop. See the sidebar, “Bypassing the clip-
board” for more on dragging and dropping.
Figure 1-10: Dragging and dropping a selection keeps your clipboard lean and mean.
What if you have multiple elements on one layer and want to select only one
of the elements to drag and drop? Simply grab the Lasso tool and draw
around the object. You don’t have to be super precise, but don’t include any
portion of the other elements on the layer. Then press the Ctrl key (Ô key
on the Mac) and press the up-arrow key once. The element will then become
neatly selected. Not only can you drag and drop the element, but you can
also move or edit it without affecting the other pixels on the layer.
Using the Paste Into command
You may occasionally want to place an image on a separate layer, yet have it
fill a selection. That’s where Edit➪Paste Into comes into play. This command
enables you to insert a copied or cut selected image into a selection outline.
Book V
Chapter 1
Creating Layers

Compositing with Multiple Images
378
For example, if you want to make it appear as if a snake is poking its head out of
the opening of a cave, or a bottle poking out of a can, as shown in Figure 1-11,
Paste Into is your command. Be sure to check out the Putting-It-Together
project in this chapter to get more practice at this practical technique.
PhotoSpin
Figure 1-11: Use the Paste Into command to make one layer appear as though 
it is emerging from another.
Follow these steps to insert a copied or cut selected image into a selection
outline:
1. Make the selection on the layer that you want the image to fill.
I’ll call this the destination layer.
Layer mask

Transforming Layers
379
2. Select the image that will fill that selection.
I’ll call this the source image.
Note: The source image can be within the same image or from another
image.
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
4. Return to the destination layer and choose Edit➪Paste Into.
Photoshop converts the selection outline on the destination layer into
a layer mask. The pasted selection is visible only inside the selection
outline. In my example, my bottle is showing only inside my selection.
The bottom of the bottle is hidden, making it look like my bottle is sit-
ting inside the can.
Transforming Layers
When compositing multiple images, you will no doubt have to scale some of
your image to fit it into your layout. Fortunately, Photoshop makes scaling
an easy chore by providing you with the Transform and Free Transform
commands on the Edit menu. Transforming layers is almost identical to
transforming selections except that you don’t need to make a selection first.
After an element is on a layer, you can just choose the appropriate transfor-
mation command and off you go. In addition, you can apply a transformation
to multiple layers simultaneously if you link the layers first. Because I explain
each transformation in excruciating detail in Book III, Chapter 3, check that
out if you need more detail.
Try to perform all your transformations in one execution. Don’t go back
numerous times and apply various transformations. Each time you trans-
form pixels, you are putting your image through the interpolation process
(manufacturing pixels). Done repeatedly, your image may start to turn into
mush. And if not mush, it will not be as pristine and crisp as it was before.
If your image looks jagged after you transform it, you may have your pref-
erences set incorrectly for your interpolation method. Choose Edit➪
Preferences➪General (Photoshop➪Preferences➪General on Mac OS X) and
select the Bicubic option from the Interpolation pop-up menu. Bicubic
enables a smoother appearance to your interpolated pixels.
When the Move tool is active, you can transform a layer without choosing
a command. Simply select the Show Transform Controls option on the
Options bar. This option surrounds the contents (or an active selection) of
the layer with a bounding box with handles. Drag these handles to trans-
form the contents.

Auto-Align Layers
380
Auto-Align Layers
One of the coolest new features in CS3 is the Auto-Align Layers command.
How many times have you taken photos at a reunion, wedding or other
family event where none of the shots are perfect. In one shot, Aunt Marlene
has her eyes closed. In another, Momma Sue is looking to the side for
Junior who should be in the photo and so on. The Auto-Align Layers feature
enables you take these multiple images and composite them into that per-
fect shot by aligning your image and then letting you mask out parts of the
image you don’t want. 
Note that you can also use the Auto-Align Layers feature to stitch together
images such as panoramic shots or scans of oversized images—any series
images where there is even a slight overlap.
Here’s how to Auto-Align your layers:
1. Create a new document with the same dimensions as your source
images.
2. Open all of your source images. With the Move tool, drag and drop
each image into the new document. Each image should be on a sepa-
rate layer.
3. If you desire, you can choose a layer to use as a reference. Lock the
reference layer. If you don’t set a reference layer, Photoshop will
analyze the layers and then select the layer in the center of the final
comp as the reference.
4. Select all of the layers you want to align and choose Edit➪Auto-Align
Layers. 
5. Choose one of the projection methods:
 Auto: Photoshop analyzes the layers, decides which method would
create the best composite and then applies either the Perspective
and Cylindrical alignment.
 Perspective: Photoshop designates one of the layers as the refer-
ence layer. The remaining layers are then transformed so that con-
tent is aligned.
 Cylindrical: This is a good option for panoramic shots. Places the
reference layer in the center and then places remaining layers on an
unfolded cylinder to minimize distortion.

Auto-Align Layers
381
 Reposition Only: This is a good option when you need to stitch
together oversized scanned images. This is also the option you want
to select if you are trying to create the perfect shot I described in the
introduction of this section.
6. Click OK.
Photoshop then finds the common areas of the layers and aligns them,
as shown in Figure 1-12. If you are stitching together images you are
done. If there are visible seams or inconsistencies, you can apply the
Auto-Blend Layers command described below.
Figure 1-12: Use the new Auto-Align Layers to stitch or composite multiple images.
Book V

Creating Layers

Auto-Blend Layers
382
If you are creating the perfect shot, you’ll want to add a layer mask to your
top layer, set your foreground color to black and using the Brush tool (with
the appropriate size tip) paint over the portions you wish to hide or delete.
In a mask, black hides pixels, therefore the layer underneath will show
through. Repeat this process of layer masking your content until you have
the shot you want.
For more on layer masks, see Book XI.
Auto-Blend Layers
You may have images that need to be “stitched” together. For example, if
you’ve take a series of panoramic shots or you’ve scanned an oversize image
in several sections because it couldn’t fit on your scanner. The Auto-Blend
command helps to smooth out the tell-tale seams or weird color inconsis-
tencies that occur when stitching together shots with different exposures
or contrast settings. Note that you can also use the File➪Automate➪
Photomerge command to stitch together images.
Here are the few steps you need to blend layers:
1. Create a new document and then open all of your source images With
the Move tool, drag and drop each image into the new document.
Each image should be on a separate layer.
2. Select all of the layers and choose Edit➪Auto-Align Layers. Note that
you can try and align the layers yourself manually.
3. Choose a projection method (see details in the Auto-Align Layers sec-
tion above).
4. Select all of the layers and choose Edit➪Auto-Blend Layers.
You’ll notice that this command automatically applies layer masks to each
layer as necessary, as shown in Figure 1-13. These layer masks attempt to
mask, or hide, under and overexposed areas.
You can only apply this command on RGB or Grayscale images.

Maybe you want to let loose your artistic side. Or maybe you need to combine several
images into one as part of a job. Whatever your reason, you can use the steps here to get
started on your first collage. And by the way, if collage is too froufrou a word for you, you
can substitute it with composite — as in the definition of “derived from many components.”
I usually do.
Creating a collage takes many steps. Throughout Book V, you find several ongoing
Putting-It-Together projects, all of which lead you to a finished collage. Be sure to save
your collage file so that you can work on it as you make your way through this book.
If you’re short on photos, you can go to www.gettyimages.com. Be sure to register

I recommend picking an image to use as your main canvas and then opening up a
supporting image that you can select and then drag onto that main image. However,
if you want, you can also start with just a blank document. For my example, I
decided on a travel theme and opened an image of the Grand Canyon and another
image of a passport, as shown in the figure.

Creating Layers
2. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers palette.
Always be sure that the Layers palette is visible whenever you’re creating a com-
posite from multiple images. You need to see what is happening as you drag and
drop, and you need to be aware of what layer you are working on at all times.
3. Select the desired element in the sup-
porting image.
Feel free to use whatever selection
method suits your fancy, but remem-
ber, the finished collage will look only
as good as its individual selections.
For more on making selections, see
Book III.
Because the contrast between my
passport and the background behind it
was very good, I grabbed the Magic
Wand tool, set the Tolerance to 50, and
clicked the passport. I then pressed
the Shift key and, with the Lasso tool,
circled the remaining pixels in the gold
type that the Magic Wand tool didn’t
pick up, as you can see in my figure.
4. Choose Select➪Modify➪Contract and
enter a value. Then choose Select➪Feather and enter a value.
Contract the selections lightly (I chose a value of 1 pixel) before you apply a feather
(I chose a 0.5 pixel value) to avoid picking up some of the background during the
feathering process.
Using a small feather helps to avoid the harsh, looks-like-I-cut-it-out-with-a-pair-of-
pinking-shears look.
5. With the Move tool, drag and drop the selection onto the background.
The Layers palette shows that you’ve produced a layer. You’ll notice that your main
image remains as the background below the layer, as shown in the figure.
Don’t worry if your element isn’t the right size. You can find a Putting-It-Together
project in Book V, Chapter 2 that shows you how to scale the layer.
6. Choose File➪Save. Name the file collage and make sure the format is Photoshop.
Keep the file in a handy spot on your hard drive so that you can find it when you’re
ready to do more with your collage.

I’ve already shown you how to create a layer by dragging and dropping a passport onto a
background image of the Grand Canyon. The process I’m demonstrating here is a little
different. It entails pasting one selection into another.
Sticking with my travel theme, I opted to take the image of a compass and paste it into
the background so that the compass looks like it’s peaking out from the side of the canyon.
To paste one selection into another on your collage, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Open. Select the file you saved from the last exercise. Also open a
new supporting image.
2. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers palette.
Always keep the Layers palette visible whenever you are creating a composite from
multiple images.
3. Select the part of the supporting image
that you want to use.
Feel free to use whatever selection
method you desire, but try to get as
accurate a selection as you can.
For my compass image, I used the
Elliptical Marquee tool, while pressing
the Alt key (Option on the Mac), to draw
from the center out to select the bottom
portion of the compass. With the same
tool, I pressed the Shift key and then the
mouse button and then the Alt key
(Option) to add the top portion of the
compass, as shown in the figure.

Chapter 1
Creating Layers
4. Contract and feather the selection (as described in Step 4 in the previous set of
steps).
Unless you’re going for some special effect, be consistent with the treatment of the
edges of each of your elements in your composite.
5. Choose Edit➪Copy.
6. In your saved collage file, move the first supporting image (the image you added in
the previous set of steps) to the side with the Move tool. Then use the Lasso tool
(or any other selection tool) to create a selection in which to paste your new sup-
porting image.
I want the compass image to look as if it is peeking up from behind the side of the
canyon, so I made a selection in the cliffs of the Grand Canyon, as shown in the figure.
7. Choose Edit➪Paste Into.
If you use the Move tool to move the pasted image around the canvas, you see that
the pasted image is invisible outside the boundaries of the selection outline, as you
can see in my collage.
Don’t be concerned if your element isn’t the right size. I show you how to scale your
layer in Book V, Chapter 2.
The Layers palette shows a second thumbnail next to the compass thumbnail. This
thumbnail represents the layer mask created automatically when you pasted into a
selection. A layer mask allows portions of the layer to show and be hidden. In my
example, the white areas on the layer mask are where my compass shows through.
Those white areas happen to correspond to the selection I made in Step 6. The
black areas represent where my compass would be hidden if I were to move it into
those areas. For more on layer masks, see Book VI, Chapter 3.

In This Chapter

 Using the Layer Comps palette
H
opefully, you had the time and inclination to check out the first chap-
ter of Book V. That’s where you get all the basic information on creat-
ing layers. In this chapter, you get the scoop on how to manage the layers
you’ve created. And unlike some coworkers, clients, or family mem-
bers, layers are downright agreeable to being managed, even
micromanaged for that matter. The beauty of layers is that
they’re so darn easy to get along with. You can hide
them, shuffle them around, link and lock them, herd
them into groups, and even smush them together
into one loving, collective layer. Yes, Photoshop
has a whole slew of ways to get your layers in the
orderly and organized fashion you deserve.
Often, hiding all the layers in your image except for
the one you want to edit is useful. You can focus on
the element at hand without the distraction of all the
other components of the image. You can hide a layer
with a single quick click of the mouse button, as I
describe in the following list:
 Hide all the layers but one: Select the layer you want to dis-
play. Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) the eye icon for that layer, in
the left column of the Layers palette. To redisplay all the layers, Alt+click
(Option+click on the Mac) the eye icon again.
 Hide an individual layer: Click the eye icon for that layer, as shown in
Figure 2-1. To redisplay the layer, click the blank space in the eye column.
You can also hide layer styles or entire layer groups by using the same
method as with layers. You can find out more about layer groups later in
this chapter. For the lowdown on layer styles, see Book V, Chapter 4.

Rearranging Layers
390
Figure 2-1: You can hide and show individual layers to better focus your tasks.
Only layers that are visible will print. This can be useful if you want to have
several versions (each on a separate layer) of an image for a project within
the same document. You can view selective layers, print them, get approval
from the powers that be, and then delete the layers with the scrapped ver-
sions. Only one file to manage — even I can handle that.
If clicking is just too strenuous for you, try this neat trick. Drag through the
eye column to hide or display multiple layers in one fell swoop. Now that’s
technology.
Rearranging Layers
You can shuffle the order of layers like clear sheets of acetate used with
overhead projectors. The stacking order of the layers in the Layers palette
corresponds to the order of the layers in the document. If you want to move
a layer to another position in the stacking order, drag the layer (or layer
set) up or down in the Layers palette. As you drag, you see a fist icon.

Moving Layer Elements
391
Release your mouse button when a highlighted line appears where you want
to insert the layer.
Alternatively, you can change the order by selecting the layer (or layer set)
and then choosing Layer➪Arrange. Then select one of the following com-
mands from the submenu:
 Bring to Front and Send to Back send the layer to the very top or very
bottom of the stacking order.
 Bring Forward and Send Backward move the layer one level up or down.
 Reverse switches the order of your layer stack if you have two or more
layers elected.
If your image has a background, it always remains the bottommost layer. If you
need to move the background, first convert it to a layer by double-clicking
the name in the Layers palette. Enter a name for the layer and click OK.
Moving Layer Elements
Rearranging layers is different from moving the content on the layer. Because
the elements on a layer are free floating on a bed of transparency, it’s a piece
of cake to move the element whenever necessary. Moving the element has
no effect on any of the other layers, and it doesn’t harm the image one iota.
To move an image on a layer, just drag it with the Move tool (arrow pointer
with a tiny four-headed arrow), located in the Tools palette; it doesn’t get
any simpler than that. Here are a few more handy tips when moving an
image and using the Move tool:
 Move the layer in 1-pixel increments: Press an arrow key (located
between the keyboard and keypad) with the Move tool selected. To move
the layer in 10-pixel increments, press Shift as you press the arrow key.
 Find out what layer holds the element you want to move (or edit in
some other way): If you have the Auto Select and Layer options selected
in the Options bar, select the Move tool and click the element. Photoshop
automatically activates the layer the element resides on. If you do not
have this option checked, then Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) the ele-
ment. Or you can right-click (Control+click on the Mac) the element.
A context menu appears, telling you what layer the element resides
on, and then enables you to select that layer from the context menu.
Note that it will also list the background layer.
This technique works only on pixels that have an opacity of 50% or
more. If you click pixels with opacities of 50% or less, Photoshop bur-
rows down into successive layers and selects the first layer below on
which it encounters a pixel with an opacity of 50% or more.
Book V
Chapter 2
Managing Layers

Moving Layer Elements
392
 Switch to a layer when you click with the Move tool on any part of a
layer: Select the Auto Select and Layer options on the Options bar. But be
careful if you use this option, especially if you have a lot of overlapping
elements; you may inadvertently select a layer when you don’t want to.
 Select the Auto Select and Groups options on the Options bar to enable
you to select the layer group that the selected layer is in. For more on
groups, see “Creating Layer Groups” later in this chapter.
 Display a bounding box with handles around the elements on your
layer: Select the Show Transform Controls check box on the Options
bar. This box can be useful if all your elements are melting into one
another in an indistinguishable conglomeration. 
I recommend keeping this option checked so that you essentially have
the same controls (scale, rotate, and so on) you have if you chose Edit➪
Free Transform. For more on transformations, see Book III, Chapter 3.
Putting It Together
Transforming and Moving Layers in a Collage
When you have a couple of images in your collage (see the Putting-It-Together projects
in Book V, Chapter 1), you can start transforming them to your liking. Moving and scaling
are the manipulations you’ll probably do the most. Photoshop enables you to transform
layers without affecting any other layer within the image. (For more on transformations,
see Book V, Chapter 1 and Book III, Chapter 3.) Here’s how to tweak images:
1. Choose File➪Open. Select your saved collage file.
2. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers palette.
3. In the Layers palette, select the layer you want to transform.
In my example, I chose the layer that has the passport on it.
4. Choose Edit➪Free Transform.
By choosing Free Transform rather than Transform, you interpolate the image only
once, rather than twice. For more on interpolation, see Book II, Chapter 1.
5. Shift+drag a corner transformation handle to scale the image down to the desired
size but maintain the proportions, which reduces the amount of distortion.
I reduced the passport in my example to about half its original size.
6. Position the cursor just outside the handle until a curved arrow appears. Rotate the
image the desired amount.
The figure shows my example; I rotated the passport about 45 degrees.
7. When you transform the selection to your liking, double-click inside the transform
box or press Enter (Return on the Mac).

Moving Layer Elements

8. Transform the element that has a layer mask. In the Layers palette, choose the
layer and follow Steps 4 through 7.
In my example, that’s the compass layer.
Be sure to click the layer’s thumbnail and not the layer mask thumbnail. Otherwise,
you transform the layer mask thumbnail instead of the element.
9. When you transform the selection to your liking, double-click in the transform box.
I scaled the compass slightly so that the top of the compass became visible. Then I
rotated the compass to show more of the compass face rather than the cover.
10.Choose File➪Save.

Moving Layer Elements
394
You probably already have a pretty good sense of the possibilities (which are infinite)
available to you when you create and change collages. Of course, you can always add
more stuff to a collage and rearrange the layers as needed. Just follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Open and select your collage file. Also open another image.
I chose a boarding pass image.
2. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers palette if it isn’t already visible.
3. Select the desired element in the supporting image.
It goes without saying that making the selection accurate can only enhance your
composite. I selected the boarding pass with the Polygon Lasso tool.
4. Contract and feather the image’s edges and use the Move tool to drag the selection
into the collage file.
For the most professional appearance possible, use consistent values for modifying
and feathering all the selections in this composite.
5. Position and transform the selection as needed.
Follow the directions provided in the preceding steps list. In my example, I scaled
the boarding pass to the same size as the passport, rotated it clockwise, and posi-
tioned it a little lower than the passport.
6. In the Layers palette, rearrange your layers if needed by selecting a layer and
dragging it above another layer.
In my image, I dragged my passport layer above my boarding pass layer, as shown
in the following figure.
Because the layers are independent entities, you can shuffle them indefinitely like a
deck of cards.
7. Choose File➪Save.

Aligning and Distributing Layers
395
Aligning and Distributing Layers
If you are a precision junkie like me, you’ll appreciate Photoshop’s ability to
align and distribute your layers. These commands can be especially useful
when you need to align items such as navigation buttons on a Web page or a
row of headshots for a corporate publication.
Here are the steps to align and distribute your layers:
1. In the Layers palette, select the layers you want to align, as shown in
Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-2: Select the layers you want to align in the 
Layers palette.
2. Choose Layer➪Align and select one of the alignment commands.
Photoshop provides you with handy little icons that illustrate the 
various alignment types. You also find these icons as buttons on the
Options bar when you have the Move tool selected, as shown in
Figure 2-3. Feel free to use either method.
Figure 2-3: The Options bar offers different alignment buttons.
Book V
Chapter 2
Managing Layers

Linking Layers
396
Note that, depending on which alignment type you choose, Photoshop
aligns to the layer element that is the farthest to the top, bottom, left, or
right. If you align to the center, Photoshop splits the difference among
the various layer elements.
3. In the Layers palette, select three or more layers that you want to 
distribute.
This command evenly spaces the layers between the first and last ele-
ments in either the row or column.
4. Choose Layer➪Distribute and select one of
the distribute commands.
Again for the word-challenged, there is an
icon illustrating the distribution types. And
like alignment, you also find the distribute
icons as buttons on the Options bar when
you have the Move tool selected. You can see
the buttons from Figure 2-2 precisely aligned
and evenly distributed in Figure 2-4.
You can also align a layer to a selection out-
line. First, make your desired selection in the
image. Then select a layer or layers in the
Layers palette. Choose Layer➪Align Layers to
Selection and choose an alignment type from
the submenu. Note that the Align to Selection
command doesn’t appear in the Layer menu
until you have both layers and an active
selection outline.
For the new Auto Align option, check out
Book V Chapter 1.
Linking Layers
You’ll probably find that the need to link layers in most cases isn’t neces-
sary. Simply select multiple layers and apply your command — moving,
scaling, rotating, and so on. Occasionally, however, you may want to link
layers so that they stay grouped as a unit until you decide otherwise. 
To link layers, follow these short steps:
Figure 2-4: The aligned and
evenly distributed buttons.

Linking Layers
397
1. Select the layer or layer groups in
the Layers palette.
2. Click the Link Layers icon at the
bottom of the Layers palette, as
shown in Figure 2-5.
A link icon appears to the right of
the layer name in the Layers
palette.
To remove a link, click the Link
Layers icon again.
If you find the need to quickly select all
the linked layers in your Layers palette,
select just one of the layers and then
choose Select Linked Layers from the
Layer menu or Layers palette pop-up
menu. This can come in handy, for
example, when working on Web pages
with lots of linked layers containing
buttons or labels in a navigation bar.

Putting It Together
Selecting Layers in a Collage and Adjusting Their Size
When you’re working on composites, you may find the need to adjust the size or angle of
more than one layer. You can select the layers you want to scale or rotate and transform
all the layers at the same time. This strategy enables you to adjust all the layers the same
amount at the same time — thus ensuring that they stay proportional in size. If you want
to be certain that all the layers stay selected during the transformation process, you can
link them for extra insurance.
1. Open your saved collage file.
Make sure that the Layers palette is visible.
2. Select the layers you want to transform. If you want to link them, simply click the
Link Layers icon at the bottom of the Layers palette.
In my example, I selected Layers 1 and 3 — my passport and boarding pass.
3. Choose Edit➪Free Transform and Shift+drag the corner transformation handle to
scale the layers. When you’re satisfied, double-click inside the transform box or
press Enter (Return on the Mac).

Locking Layers
398
Because both layers are selected, any transformation you apply, including moving
and scaling, affects both layers, as shown in the figure.
4. Save the file when you’re done.
continued
Locking Layers
After you get your layers the way you
want them, you may want to lock them
to prevent them from being changed,
as shown in Figure 2-6. To lock a layer,
select it in the Layers palette and
select one or more of the lock options
at the top of the Layers palette. See
Table 2-1 for details about each option.
You can also choose Layer➪Lock
Layers or choose Lock Layers from the
Layers palette pop-up menu.
When you select the Lock All option, a
solid, dark gray lock icon appears on
the layer, indicating the layer is fully
locked. When you select any of the
other lock options, the lock appears
light gray and hollow, indicating the
layer is partially locked.
Fully locked

Color-Coding Layers

By default, the background is locked and cannot be unlocked until you con-
vert the background into a layer by choosing Layer➪New➪Layer from
Background. In addition, by default, type layers have the Lock Transparent
Pixels and Lock Image Pixels options selected. These options are grayed out
and cannot be deselected. However, if you need to paint on the type layer,
you can always rasterize it, thereby removing all locking options. For more
on type, see Book IV, Chapter 3.
If you have layer groups, you can choose Layer➪Lock All Layers in Group or
choose Lock All Layers in Group from the Layers palette pop-up menu.

Color-Coding Layers
To visually distinguish your layers in
the Layers palette, Photoshop lets
you color-code your layers or layer
sets, as shown in Figure 2-7. Choose
Layer➪Layer Properties or choose
Layer Properties from the Layers
palette pop-up menu. Choose a
color from the drop-down list and
click OK. 
For a great time saver, right-click
(Ctrl+click on the Mac) the layer’s eye-
ball icon and you get a context menu
listing the colors.
Book V
Chapter 2
Managing Layers
Figure 2-7: Color-coding layers helps to
visually identify and organize your layers.

Creating Layer Groups
400
I find that color-coding works especially well with layer groups. First, organ-
ize your layers into groups, such as navigation buttons, type, images, border,
background, and so on. Then assign a color to each group. By using the
same color-coding system from one project to the next, you can get a little
productivity boost by instinctively knowing where to find your elements.
Creating Layer Groups
I don’t know about you, but having a file cabinet full of neatly labeled manila
folders containing all my vital paperwork is very satisfying. It’s compact.
It’s organized. It’s “at the ready,” as they say in the military. Fellow geeks
can revel in Photoshop’s digital answer to the manila folder, which enables
you to organize layers into layer groups. You can expand or collapse layer
groups to see or hide their contents. In their collapsed state, layer groups
are a great antidote for the annoying scrolling that one must do in an abun-
dantly layered file. And groups enable you to apply opacity settings, blend
modes, and layer styles to multiple layers at a time.
To create a layer group, click the Create
a New Group icon (the folder icon) at
the bottom of the Layers palette, shown
in Figure 2-8. You can also choose New
Group from the Layers palette pop-up
menu or choose Layer➪New➪Group.
The latter two methods prompt you for
a group name in addition to a few other
options (similar to regular layers).
You can color-code your group and
specify a blend mode and opacity set-
ting. Note that the default mode is Pass
Through, which lets the blend modes
applied to the individual layers remain
intact. If you choose any other mode,
it overrides all the layers in the group.
After you create your group, drag
your layers into the group folder in
the Layers palette. If the group is col-
lapsed when you drag or if you drag a
layer on top of the group icon itself,
Photoshop places the layer at the
bottom of the layer group. If the group

is expanded, you can drag the layer to a specific location within the group.
To collapse or expand the group, click the triangle icon to the left of the
folder icon.
Although layer groups are pretty straightforward, keep these few points
in mind:
 As with regular layers, you can select, duplicate, show, hide, lock, and
rearrange layer groups. See other sections in this chapter for more on
these commands.
 You can nest layer groups. Create (or drag) one layer group into another
layer group.
 You can create a layer group from selected layers. Select the layers you
want in a group and choose New Group from Layers from the Layers
palette pop-up menu or choose Layer➪New➪Group from Layers. Name
the group and click OK.
 If you select a layer within a group and then choose Layer➪Arrange, the
command applies to the stacking order only within the layer group.
 You can merge layer groups. Select the group and choose Merge Group
from the Layers palette pop-up menu or choose Layer➪Merge Group.
For more on merging, see the next section.
 You can rename your group by double-clicking the group name in the
Layers palette. Or choose Layer➪Group Properties or choose Group
Properties from the Layers palette pop-up menu.
 In addition, you can lock layers within a group. Choose Lock All Layers
in Group from the Layers palette pop-up menu or choose Layer➪Lock
All Layers in Group. 
Flattening and Merging Layers
Being the true layers evangelist that I am, I have spent the last two chapters
touting the glories of layers. And they are wonderful. But they do have a dark
side. They can make your file go from slim and trim to bulky and bloated.
You not only get a larger file size that slows your computer system perform-
ance, but you’re also limited to the file formats that allow you to save layers:
Photoshop’s native format (.psd), TIFF (.tif), Large Document Format
(.psb), and PDF (.pdf). If you save your file in any other format, Photoshop
smashes your layers down into a background. This file limitation often
forces users to save two versions of every layered file — one as a native
Book V
Chapter 2
Managing Layers

Flattening and Merging Layers
402
Photoshop file and one as something else, such as EPS or JPEG, to import
into another program. For more on file formats, see Book II, Chapter 2. To
curb large file sizes or use layered images in a wider range of formats, you
have a couple of options:
 Merging layers combines visible, linked, or adjacent layers into a single
layer (not a background). The intersection of all transparent areas is
retained. You can merge layers or layer groups. You can also merge
adjustment or fill layers (see Book V, Chapter 1 for details), but they
cannot act as the target layer for the merge. Merging layers can help
decrease your file size and make your document more manageable.
You’re still restricted to the layer-friendly file formats, however.
 Flattening an image combines all visible layers into a background.
Photoshop deletes hidden layers and fills any transparent areas with
white. Flattening is usually reserved for when you’re completely fin-
ished editing your image.
When you convert an image from one color mode to another, it may cause
the file to flatten. Look out for the warning dialog box that prompts you of
this result and go back and save a copy of your file as a native Photoshop
file, thereby preserving your layers.
Merging layers
You can merge your layers several ways. Here’s the first option:
1. Ensure that all the layers (and layer sets) you want to merge are visi-
ble, as shown in Figure 2-9.
Figure 2-9: Merging layers can make your file size a lot smaller.

Flattening and Merging Layers
403
2. Choose Merge Visible from the Layers palette pop-up menu or the
Layer menu.
All visible layers are smushed into a single layer, as shown in Figure 2-9.
The newly merged layer takes on the name of the topmost layer.
Press Alt (Option on the Mac) when choosing Layer➪Merge Visible.
Photoshop merges those layers onto a new layer.
You can also merge layers using this method:
1. Position the layer or layer groups you want to merge adjacent to each
other in the Layers palette.
2. Select the top layer of those you want merged.
3. Choose Merge Down from the Layers palette pop-up menu or the
Layer menu. If the top layer is a layer group, the command is called
Merge Group.
Note that Merge Down merges your active layer with all layers below it,
so make sure that every layer underneath your active layer should be
merged.
Stamping layers
Stamping layers is the ability to merge elements of one or more layers into a
target layer while leaving other layers untouched. Normally, the selected
layers are stamped down into the layer directly below them. To stamp
layers, follow these steps:
1. Move the layer or layers you want to stamp above the layer you want
to stamp into. Both layers must be visible.
2. Select the top layer and press Ctrl+Alt+E (Ô+Option+E on the Mac).
If you want to stamp all visible layers, select the layer that will contain the
merged elements and press Shift+Ctrl+Alt+E (Shift+Ô+Option+E on the
Mac). You may need to borrow a friend’s fingers for that keyboard combo.
Flattening layers
To flatten an image, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that all the layers you want to retain are visible.
Photoshop discards all hidden layers.
Book V
Chapter 2
Managing Layers

Flattening and Merging Layers
404
2. Choose Layer➪Flatten Image, or choose
Flatten Image from the Layers palette
pop-up menu.
Your flattened image is filled with the back-
ground color and appears as a background
layer in the Layers palette, as shown in
Figure 2-10.
Note that Photoshop doesn’t prompt you
with a warning like, “Are you sure you
really want to do this?” But if you mistak-
enly flatten your image, you can undo the
command immediately by choosing
Edit➪Undo. If you’ve gone ahead and per-
formed another action, then undo your
mistake by using the History palette (see
Book II, Chapter 4).
Putting It Together
Checking Your Collage for Flaws and Consolidating Layers
When you begin a project, you may think you know what you want the final result to look
like. But as your creative juices start flowing, you may decide that something doesn’t look
right. For example, as I was working on my collage, I discovered that the sky behind and
above the canyon was a little on the ordinary side.
1. Open the saved collage file and open a new
image that you want to incorporate into the 
collage.
In my example, I thought the sky needed some
kick, so I opened an image that contained a sky
I liked.
2. Select the part of the image that you want to add to your collage as shown in the
figure.
Most of the time, consistency is key. In my example, however, I didn’t need to
feather the image. Because I’m going to paste it into the old sky, the edges of the
element won’t be seen.
3. Using the Move tool, drag the selection into the collage.
Because I’m pasting the image into the background image, I first needed to make
the selection I wanted to paste into. I used the Magic Wand tool. After a couple of
additional Shift+clicks, I selected the entire sky behind the canyon. Then I copied
and pasted the image (using the Edit➪Paste Into command) into its new location, as
shown in the figure.

Managing Layers
When you’re close to finalizing your collage, you might want to consolidate layers.
Minimizing the number of layers makes projects easier to manage and your file size
smaller, which is great when you get ready to add the finishing touches to your collage.
Be sure that before you merge your layers, you will never have to manipulate them sepa-
rately, especially if the elements on the layer overlap each other, as mine do.
To consolidate two layers, follow these steps:
1. Select the layers in the Layers palette.
2. Choose Merge Layers from the Layers palette pop-up menu.
The two layers merge and become one.
3. Choose File➪Save.
Working with the Layer Comps Palette
The Layer Comps feature doesn’t really add more layer functionality, but
because it shares a similar moniker, I explain it in this minibook.
What Layer Comps does do is enable you to create and save multiple ver-
sions of your project within a single master file. Through the Layer Comps
palette, Photoshop records all the vital statistics of your layers, including
their visibility, position, and blending options. These statistics come in
handy when you want to show a client or art director various design ver-
sions within a single document. That’s right. No longer do you have to save
the various renditions of a design or project in multiple files. Just be aware
that layer comps do add to your file size.

Working with the Layer Comps Palette

The following steps walk you through the day-to-day operation of the Layer
Comps palette:
1. Choose Window➪Layer Comps to display the palette, shown in
Figure 2-11.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 2-11: The Layer Comps palette enables you to create and save multiple versions of a
project within a single document.
2. Create all your desired layer content. Note that if you perform all
your editing on just a Background layer, you cannot save the docu-
ment as a layer comp.
3. When you have a version of the document that you want to save as a
comp, click the New Layer Comp button at the bottom of the palette
or choose New Layer Comp from the palette pop-up menu.
The New Layer Comp dialog box appears.
To create a comp and bypass the options dialog box, hold down the Alt
(Option on the Mac) key when you click the New Layer Comp button.
Note if you execute certain commands, such as changing the size of the
document (cropping, using Image Size or Canvas Size, and so on) or rotat-
ing by any amount other than 180 degrees, you get a warning alarm icon,
which informs you that you won’t be able to fully restore the layer comp.

Working with the Layer Comps Palette

4. Name your layer comp, and
choose the attributes you want
recorded — Visibility, Position,
and Appearance (Layer Style) of
the layers. You can also add an
optional comment about the con-
figuration you are capturing, as
shown in Figure 2-12. Click OK.
Note that if you add a comment,
you see a triangle just to the left of
the layer comp name (refer to the sunflower solo comp shown in Figure
2-11). Click the triangle to see your comment in the palette.
5. Continue creating your various configurations of the document, cap-
turing a layer comp after each.
6. To display a particular layer comp, click in the left column in the
Layer Comps palette.
In the column on the left side of the palette, you see a document icon,
which indicates that particular layer comp is selected.
7. To efficiently cycle through all your layer comps, Ctrl+click, (Ô+click
for Mac) all your comps in the palette to select them all. 
You can also click the first layer comp and then Shift+click the last layer
comp, which automatically selects all files in between. Then click the
Apply Next Selected Layer Comp or Apply Previous Selected Layer
Comp icon at the bottom of the Layer Comps palette.
You can also, less efficiently, apply layer comps by selecting the particu-
lar layer comp and choosing Apply Layer Comp from the palette pop-up
menu. The document icon moves to that layer, and Photoshop displays
that layer comp.
Here are a few more Layer Comp tidbits:
 To rename a layer comp, simply double-click its name in the palette.
 To delete a layer comp, select it and click the trash can icon in the
Layer Comps palette. You can also drag the layer comp to the trash
can icon or choose Delete Layer Comp from the palette pop-up menu.
 To duplicate a layer comp, select it and drag it onto the New Layer
Comp icon in the palette or choose Duplicate Layer Comp from the
palette pop-up menu.
 To update a particular layer comp with the currently active configura-
tion of the document, select the layer comp and then choose Update
Layer Comp from the palette pop-up menu or click the Update Layer
Comp button at the bottom of the palette.

 To display your document at its latest configuration (but not necessar-
ily the latest saved layer comp), choose Restore Last Document State
from the palette pop-up or simply click the Last Document State icon in
the Layer Comps palette.
 To rearrange the order of the layer comps, simply drag it to a new loca-
tion in the palette.
Photoshop offers you a variety of great ways to output your layer comps.
Here is the lowdown on each:
 Choose File➪Scripts➪Layer
Comps to Files: Select this com-
mand and Photoshop exports your
layer comps to individual files. In
the dialog box, shown in Figure
2-13, provide a destination and
prefix name for your file. Indicate
whether you want to include
Selected Layer Comps Only 
(you must select them before 
you choose the command). Leave
that option deselected to have
Photoshop export all layer comps.
Then choose your desired file type
and specify whether you want to
include ICC Profiles (see Book II,
Chapter 2) and Maximize
Compatibility (see Book I,
Chapter 5). Click Run and then sit
back and watch the magic happen. 
 Choose File➪Scripts➪Layer Comps to PDF: Choose this command to
export your layer comps as a multipage PDF file. Photoshop saves each
layer to a separate PDF page. In the dialog box, click the Browse button
to provide a filename and destination. Indicate whether you want to
include only selected layer comps. Then choose your options for your
PDF Slide Show presentation. Specify the amount of time you want in
between pages and whether you want the show to loop (keep playing
continuously). Click Run. Photoshop runs the script and saves the PDF
to your destination. 
 Choose File➪Scripts➪Layer Comps to WPG: This option exports your
layer comps to a Windows Photo Gallery. In the dialog box, click Browse
and choose a destination for your file. Next, specify a gallery style and
whether you want to export only the selected layer comps. Click Run.
Photoshop does its scripting thing and automatically launches a
Windows Photo Gallery in your default browser, displaying each 
layer comp both as a thumbnail and as a larger image.

n this chapter, I show you how to let down your hair and get those cre-
ative juices flowing. Yes, I’m about to say the “F” word: Fun.
This chapter, along with Book V, Chapter 4, focuses on how to tweak the
layers you’ve made. Maybe you want to make one of your layers semitrans-
parent so that you can see the layer beneath it; or say you want to
try blending the colors between a couple layers in a way that
is slightly offbeat. Look no further.
Although some techniques in this chapter may reek of
complexity, keep in mind that you don’t need to
totally understand them. Take these techniques as
far as you want. And remember there’s no substi-
tute for good old experimentation. Before you
jump into these techniques, it helps to have a
handle on the methods of layer creation and man-
agement that I explain in Book V, Chapters 1 and 2.
Adjusting Layer Opacity
By far one of the easiest ways to make your image look oh so
sophisticated is to have one image ghosted over another, as
shown in Figure 3-1. Creating this effect is a snap with the Opacity option in
the Layers palette. You adjust the opacity in two ways:
 Select your desired layer in the Layers palette. Then either access the
slider by clicking the right-pointing arrow or enter a percentage value in
the Opacity text box. 
 You can also double-click a layer thumbnail, choose Layer➪Layer Style➪
Blending Options, or choose Blending Options from the Layers palette pop-
up menu. (Click the triangle in the upper-right corner to open the menu.)

Adjusting Layer Opacity
410
Figure 3-1: Adjusting the opacity enables one image to ghost over another.
Either of these methods brings up the Layer Style dialog box, where you can
enter a value or drag the slider for opacity.
The Opacity setting allows you to mix the active layer with the layers below
it in varying percentages from 100% (completely opaque) to 0% (completely
transparent). Remember that you can adjust the opacity only on a layer, not
a background.
You can also change the Opacity percentage by using keyboard shortcuts.
With any tool active, except a painting or editing tool, press a number key.
Press 5 for 50 percent, 25 for 25 percent. If you are entering a two-digit
value, just be sure you type the numbers quickly or else Photoshop inter-
prets the numbers as two different values. You get the picture. Note that for
the default of 100 percent, you must press 0.

Creating Effects with Blend Modes
411
Adjusting the Fill Opacity
In addition to adjusting the regular opac-
ity for a layer, you can also adjust the fill
opacity. Fill opacity works a little differ-
ently from regular opacity. The regular
Opacity setting affects layer styles (see
Book V, Chapter 4) and blend modes (see
the following section, “Creating Effects
with Blend Modes”), which have been
applied to the layer. Fill opacity, how-
ever, affects only the pixels or shapes
that reside on the layer. It doesn’t affect
the styles or blends. As you can see in
Figure 3-2, the drop shadow and emboss
styles in the bottom example show
through full strength. 
To adjust the Fill Opacity setting, select
your desired layer in the Layers palette
and enter a value in the Fill Opacity
text box or drag the pop-up slider. The other methods for adjusting fill opac-
ity are similar to the regular opacity option.
Creating Effects with Blend Modes
Photoshop’s 25 blend modes (27 when working with the painting and editing
tools) determine how the colors in different layers interact with each other.
Blend modes can produce a multitude of interesting, sometimes even
bizarre, effects. And what’s more, you can easily apply, change, or discard
blend modes with no permanent damage to your layers.
Most options in the Blend Mode pop-up menu (located on the Layers tab) in
the Layers palette are the same as those on the Mode pop-up menu on the
Options bar. The exceptions are the Behind and Clear modes, which you can
find only on the Options bar because they are available only for use with
painting and editing tools.
I urge you to pick an image with a few layers and apply each blend mode to
get a good handle on what the various blend modes do. In fact, try a few dif-
ferent images, because the effects may be subtle or intense depending on
the colors in the image. Throw in some different opacity percentages, and
you’re on your way to endless hours of creative fun.

Figure 3-2: Fill opacity (bottom) affects
only layer pixels, not styles or blend modes
that have been applied to the layer.

Creating Effects with Blend Modes
412
You’ll find these modes called blend modes, painting modes, brush modes,
layer modes, calculations, or just plain modes. They are usually referred to
as blend modes or layer modes when used with layers and painting modes,
and brush modes when used in conjunction with a painting or editing tool.
General blend modes
In the General category, you find the following modes, which are shown in
Figure 3-3 and explained in Table 3-1.
Figure 3-3: The Behind and Clear blend modes are available only 
with a painting or editing tool.
Table 3-1
General Blend Modes

Description
Normal
You’re probably very familiar with the Normal blend mode by now. It is
the default that lets each pixel appear in its very own unadulterated
state. The other three modes are used only in certain circumstances. 
Dissolve
The effects of Dissolve can be seen only with a layer that has an opacity
setting of less than 100% — the lower the opacity, the more intense the
effect. The effect is created by allowing some pixels from lower layers,
which are randomized, to show through the target layer.

Blend Mode
Description
Behind
Available only with a painting or editing tool active. Type must be raster-
ized, and Lock Transparency must be deselected. Allows you to edit or
paint only on the transparent areas of the layer, giving the illusion that
the strokes are behind the layer.
Clear
Available only with a painting or editing tool active. Type must be raster-
ized, and Lock Transparency must be deselected. Allows you to edit or
paint with transparency, giving the appearance that holes are being
punched into your image. 
Blend modes that darken
Overall, the blend modes in this category all produce effects that darken
your image, as shown in Figure 3-4. However, one of my favorite uses for the
Darken blend mode is a little different. Scan a handwritten letter or sheet of
music and layer it over an image. Apply the Darken blend mode to the letter
or sheet music layer. The white areas of the paper become transparent, and
only the letters or musical notes display, creating a nice composite image.
Table 3-2 describes these modes.
Table 3-2
Blend Modes That Darken
Blend Mode
Description
Darken
If the pixels on the layer are lighter than those below, the lighter pixels
turn transparent. If the pixels on the layer are darker, they display
unchanged. A great mode for superimposing scanned text or line art
because it allows the white color of the paper to essentially drop out,
leaving only the dark letters or lines. 
Multiply
Burns the layer into the layers underneath. The Multiply mode darkens
all colors where they mix. With layers, it is comparable to sticking two
slides in the same slot in a slide projector. If painting, each successive
stroke creates a darker color, as if drawing with markers.
Color Burn
Darkens the layers underneath and burns them with color. Increases
contrast. Blending with white pixels has no effect. Like applying a dark
dye to your image.
Linear Burn
Darkens the layers underneath by decreasing the brightness. Similar to
Multiply but tends to make portions of your image pure black. Blending
with white pixels has no effect.
Darker Color
When blending two layers, the darker of the two colors will be visible.

Blend modes that lighten
If you have blend modes that darken, well, having those that lighten just
makes good sense. So if you have the need to throw some digital bleach on
your brightly colored pixels, try out a couple of these blend modes, which I
describe in Table 3-3. Figure 3-5 shows examples of these effects.

black pixels has no effect. Like putting two slides in two different projectors
and pointing them at the same screen. The opposite of Multiply.

 Overlay: Multiplies the dark pixels in the top
layer and screens the light pixels in the under-
lying layers. Enhances the contrast and satura-
tion of colors.
 Soft Light: Darkens the dark pixels and light-
ens the light pixels. If the pixels on the top
layer are lighter than 50% gray, the lighter
pixels are lightened further. If the pixels on the
top layer are darker than 50% gray, the mode
darkens pixels. Blending with black or white
results in darker or lighter pixels but doesn’t
make parts of your image pure black or pure
white. Similar to Overlay, but softer and sub-
tler. Like shining a soft spotlight on the image.
 Hard Light: Multiplies the dark pixels and
screens the light pixels. Like shining a bright,
hard spotlight on the image. If the pixels on
the top layer are lighter than 50% gray, they
are screened. If the pixels on the top layer are
darker than 50% gray, the mode multiplies the
pixels. Can be used to add highlights and shad-
ows to an image. Blending with black or white
gives you black and white.
 Vivid Light: If the pixels on the top layer are
darker than 50% gray, this mode burns, or
darkens, the colors by increasing the contrast.
If the pixels on the top layer are lighter than
50% gray, the mode dodges, or lightens, the
colors by decreasing the contrast. A combina-
tion of Color Burn and Color Dodge.
 Linear Light: If the pixels on the top layer are
darker than 50% gray, the mode burns, or dark-
ens, the colors by decreasing the brightness.
If the pixels on the top layer are lighter than
50% gray, the mode dodges, or lightens, the
colors by increasing the brightness. A combi-
nation of Linear Burn and Linear Dodge.
 Pin Light: Replaces the colors of pixels,
depending on the colors in the top layer. If the
pixels on the top layer are darker than 50%
gray, the mode replaces pixels darker than
those on the top layer and doesn’t change
lighter pixels. If the pixels on the top layer are
lighter than 50% gray, the mode replaces the
pixels that are lighter than those pixels on the
top layer, and doesn’t change pixels that are

darker. A combination of Darken and Lighten
and useful for special effects.
 Hard Mix: Similar to Vivid Light, but reduces
the colors to a total of eight — Cyan, Magenta,
Yellow, Black, Red, Green, Blue, and White.
Although the results depend on the mix of
existing colors on the top and bottom layers,
this mode creates a highly posterized effect.
Blend modes that invert
If the preceding blend modes are a tad too tame for you, you may want to
check out the “Inverters” — Difference and Exclusion (described in Table 3-4).
These blend modes invert your colors and can produce some interesting
special effects, as shown in Figure 3-6.

Blend Modes That Invert
Blend Mode
Description
Difference
Produces a negative or inverted effect according to the brightness values on
the top layers. If the pixels on the top layer are black, the mode doesn’t change
the colors of the underlying layers. If the pixels on the top layer are white, the
mode inverts the colors of the underlying layers. Can produce bizarre results.
Exclusion
Similar to Difference, but with less contrast and saturation. If the pixels on
the top layer are black, the mode doesn’t change the colors of the underly-
ing layers. If the pixels on the top layer are white, the mode inverts the
colors of the underlying layers. Medium colors blend to create gray.
HSL color model blend modes
These blend modes use the HSL (Hue Saturation Lightness) color model to
mix colors. My favorite blend mode in this group is Color, which allows you
to apply color to images without obscuring the tonality. The Color mode is
great for “hand painting” grayscale images. See details on this technique in
Book IV Chapter 1. Two new blend modes were added in CS3, Lighter Color
and Darker Color. These two blend modes work on the total of all of the
channels in the image, unlike the Lighten and Darken modes which blend
per individual channel. The benefit of blending all channels simultaneously
is that you avoid creating a third, and possibly unwanted, color. Table 3-5
lists these modes, and Figure 3-7 shows their effects.
Figure 3-7: These blend modes use the Hue Saturation Lightness 
color model to mix colors.

Description
Hue
Blends the luminance (brightness) and saturation (intensity of the color) of
the underlying layers with the hue (color) of the top layer.
Saturation
Blends the luminance and hue of the underlying layers with the saturation
of the top layer.
Color
Blends the luminance of the underlying layers with the saturation and hue
of the top layer. This mode is great for colorizing grayscale (with a color
mode set to RGB) images because it preserves the shadows, highlights,
and details of the underlying layers.
Luminosity
Blends the hue and saturation of the underlying layers with the luminance
of the top layer. Preserves the shadows, highlights, and details from the
top layer and mixes them with the colors of the underlying layers. The
opposite of Color.
The following blend modes work with 8, 16 and 32-bit images: Normal,
Dissolve, Darken, Multiply, Lighten, Linear Dodge, Difference, Hue, Saturation,
Color, Luminosity, Lighter Color, Darker Color.
Working with the Advanced Blending Options
If you want to get serious about layers,
then you need to know about the
Advanced Blending Options, which
you can find in the Layer Style dialog
box. These options allow you to tailor
the way your layer styles and blend
modes interact with your layers.
Getting to the advanced options is just
like accessing opacity and blend
modes: You can double-click a layer
thumbnail, choose Layer➪Layer
Style➪Blending Options, or choose
Blending Options from the Layers
palette pop-up menu. The massive
Layer Style dialog box rears its multipaneled head, as shown in Figure 3-8.
(By the way, if you’re ready to know about more these blending features,
skip to Book V, Chapter 4, where I cover layer styles.)

Advanced options to blend with
The advanced options are not for the faint of heart. To be frank, the options
are, well, advanced, so you might find them a tad too eggheady for your
taste, but if not, here you go:
 Fill Opacity: I cover this in “Adjusting the Fill Opacity,” earlier in this
chapter.
 Channels: This option allows you to restrict your blending options to
specific channels only. For all you need to know about working with
channels, check out Book VI.
 Knockout: This option allows you
to specify which layers have holes
in them so that you can view the
layers underneath. You first have
to use the Fill Opacity option to
set the opacity of the knockout.
The lower the opacity, the more
the hole shows; therefore, set it to
0% (as in my example in Figure
3-9) to see all the way through. Set
the Knockout to Shallow to create
a hole through one layer set (see
Book V, Chapter 2) or a clipping
group (see Book V, Chapter 4). Set
the Knockout to Deep to create a
hole all the way through to the
background. If you’re just working
with layers, and not sets or clip-
ping groups, the knockout cuts
through to the background. If
there is no background, it cuts
through to transparency.
 Blend Interior Effects as Group: This option applies the blend mode of
the layer to interior layer effects, such as inner glows, satin and color
overlay, and so on. Deselect this option, and the blend mode does not
affect the layer effects. You can see the difference in Figure 3-10.
 Blend Clipped Layers as Group: The blend mode of the bottom layer in
the clipping group affects all the other layers in the group. Deselect this
option, and each layer retains its own blend mode and appearance.
 Transparency Shapes Layer: Confines layer effects and knockouts to
opaque areas of a layer. Deselect this option, and the mode applies
layer effects and knockouts to the entire layer. (See Figure 3-11.)
Figure 3-9: A knockout cuts holes in your
layers to enable you to view the layers
underneath.

 Layer Mask Hides Effects: Confines layer effects to the area designated
by the layer mask. (For more on layer masks, see Book VI, Chapter 3.)
 Vector Mask Hides Effects: Confines layer effects to the visible area des-
ignated by a vector mask, as shown in Figure 3-12. (For more on vector
masks, see Book VI, Chapter 3.)
Figure 3-10: The Blend Interior Effects as Group option applies 
the blend mode of the type layers to the layer’s inner glow, bevel 
and emboss, and color overlay.

Figure 3-12: Choose to confine your effects to the vector mask, or not.
Blend If options
By using the slider bars, you can specify which colors are visible in the
active layer and which colors show through from the underlying layers. You
can choose a specific channel from the Blend If pop-up menu to apply the
option to a single channel. The default channel of Gray affects all channels
in the image. The two sliders at the bottom of the Layer Style dialog box do
the following:
 This Layer: Allows you to set a blending range. In other words, you can
hide certain colors according to the brightness values in the active
layer. By dragging the black triangle to the right, you exclude darker
colors. By dragging the white triangle to the left, you exclude lighter
colors.
 Underlying Layers: Forces the colors from the underlying layers to
show through the active layer. Again, dragging the black and white tri-
angles excludes ranges of colors.
Excluding and forcing colors can result in some harsh color transitions. You
can provide for a smoother transition between blended and unblended
areas by splitting the slider into two parts. This allows the pixels to gradu-
ally fade to transparency. Alt+drag (Option+drag on the Mac) on either the
black or white triangle in either slider bar to split the triangle into two
halves. The left and right triangles mark the beginning and end of the blend-
ing range, where pixels fade into or out of view.

Putting It Together
Fine-Tuning and Adjusting Opacity Settings in Your Collage
If you’ve followed along with the Putting-It-Together projects I discuss in Book V, Chap-
ters 1 and 2, you may have a collage that you’re pretty satisfied with. You just need to
make the final tweaks and finally go to sleep (or get home to your spouse and children). 
One of the most important tweaks you can make is to opacity. Here’s how to adjust the
opacity settings on some of the layers:
1. Open your saved collage file.
If the Layers palette isn’t already visible, open it.
2. Select a layer in your collage and move the opacity slider to the left or to the right.
If you want the layer to be more opaque, move the slider to the right. If you’re inter-
ested in making the layer more transparent, move the slider to the left.
I chose Layer 4 and adjusted the opacity to 75%. I like the blue sky in my collage, but
it’s a tad too vibrant in comparison to the rest of the image. Adjusting the opacity
tones down and allows the blue to blend in more naturally.

Working with the Advanced Blending Options

3. Save the file and move on to the next layer you want to adjust.
If you have more complicated opacity settings to adjust, keep reading.
4. Select the background layer and then choose Duplicate Layer from the Layers
palette pop-up menu. Click OK to close the Duplicate Layer dialog box.
Making a copy of the background is great because it allows you to add a blend
mode, as you’ll do in the next step, and then adjust it to get just the right amount of
the effect.
For example, if you want to define an element in your collage, but applying it directly
on the layer produces too intense of an effect, make a copy of the layer. I wanted to
pump up the definition of the canyon in my collage, but when I used the blend mode
directly on the background, the result looked too harsh.
By the way, I couldn’t resist the urge to include a pair of hiking boots in my collage.
5. Select the background copy layer and choose a mode (such as Vivid Light) from the
Mode pop-up menu in the Layers palette.
The definition likely looks great but the contrast is over the top.
6. Adjust the opacity to tone it down.
I changed the opacity in mine to 35%.
7. When you’re satisfied with the opacity and contrast, save the collage file.

fter you have all the basic elements in your layered composite image,
you may want to give it a little pizzazz and finesse. Maybe a headline
would pop out a little more if you beveled the edge, or maybe that silhouetted
image would take on a little more dimension if you placed a drop shadow
behind it. This chapter is where you find out how to do that and
more. (If you’re wondering how to create a composite image
with layers, see Book V, Chapters 1, 2, and 3, which intro-
duce the basics of creating composites with layers.)
Layer Styles Basics
In the old days, creating a drop shadow in
Photoshop took a concerted effort. And beveled or
embossed type? Well, let’s just say you really had
to have the inside scoop on some Photoshop tricks.
Now, however, Photoshop makes creating these kinds
of effects as easy as selecting an option.
In this chapter, you may see the terms effect and style used
interchangeably. Technically, however, Adobe says that after
layer effects are applied to a layer, they become part of a layer’s style.
You can save and load styles, but not effects. So if you apply a bunch of
effects and want to be able to easily recreate the look, then save it as a style.
You can apply layer effects to regular layers, shape layers, fill layers, and
type layers, but not to backgrounds, locked layers, or layer groups. For
more on backgrounds, see Book V, Chapter 1. For details on locking layers
and creating layer sets, see Book V, Chapter 2.

Introducing the Many Layer Styles
426
Layer effects are dynamically linked to the contents of a layer. If you move
or edit the contents of the layers, the effects are updated. When you apply
effects, they become part of the layer’s style. A styled layer has an fx
symbol next to the layer’s name in the Layers palette. You can expand (to
view the individual effects) or collapse the layer style by clicking the trian-
gle icon next to the florin. If you create a style so fantastic that you want to
save it for later use, you can do that by saving a custom style as a preset
and storing it in the Styles palette (see “Creating your own style,” later in
this chapter). Feel free to cut loose and have some fun. Layer styles are
completely non-destructive. By that I mean they don’t muck around with
your actual pixel data. If you don’t like them, edit them. If you really don’t
like them, delete them, and you’re back to your original unstylized image.
Introducing the Many Layer Styles
Layer effects fall into a few categories. You can add shadows, glow effects,
beveled and embossed edges, overlay colors and patterns, and, of course,
tweak to your heart’s content. This section introduces the various effects
that you can apply. Later in this chapter, I explain how you apply each layer
style and tweak its settings.
Shadows add a soft drop or inner shadow to a selection or the contents of a
layer. You can adjust the blend mode, color, opacity, angle, size, and contour
to suit your needs. Figure 4-1 shows examples of both types of shadows.
Figure 4-1: Add dimension by applying an inner or drop shadow to your object or type.
Glows add a soft highlight that appears on the outside or inside edges of a
selection or the contents of a layer, as shown in Figure 4-2. Like shadows,
you can fine-tune the appearance by adjusting numerous options.

Figure 4-2: Inner and outer glows add a soft highlight to edges.
Bevels create a 3-D edge on either the outside or inside edges of a selection or
the contents of a layer, giving the element some dimension. Similarly, emboss
effects make elements appear raised off or punched into the page. Satin 
creates a satiny or draped fabric effect over your element. All these effects
(shown in Figure 4-3) offer numerous options to adjust their appearances.

Overlays apply a fill of color, a gradient, or a pattern over your selection or
the contents of your layer, as shown in Figure 4-4. You can adjust the opac-
ity of the overlay, among other options, so that your original element shows
through more clearly. You can also surround your element with a stroke
consisting of a color, gradient, or pattern.
Figure 4-4: Overlays cover your object or type.
Applying a Layer Effect
Follow these steps to apply a layer effect:
1. Select your desired layer in the Layers palette.
2. Choose Layer➪Layer Style and choose an effect from the submenu.
You can click the Layer Style icon in the Layers palette and choose an
effect from the pop-up menu.
An intimidating Layer Style dialog box with a ton of options rears its
head, as shown in Figure 4-5.

4. To accept the default settings, just click OK. Or you can experiment
with the settings.
You can use sliders, or you can enter values in the text boxes. The
upcoming sections in this chapter describe the options and settings in
detail.
5. After you refine your effect settings, click OK.
Photoshop applies your effect to your layer, as indicated by the fx icon.
Managing and Editing Layer Styles
You can always just apply the layer effect with Photoshop’s default settings,
but what fun is that? To edit a style, double-click the Effect name, double-
click the layer thumbnail or double-click the Layer Style icon in the Layers
palette and make your desired adjustments in the Layer Style dialog box. If
Book V

Layer Styles and
Clipping Groups

Managing and Editing Layer Styles

you double-clicked the layer thumbnail or the icon, be sure and select your
desired effect from the left side of the dialog box to get access to your
effect’s settings.
The following sections give you the details on each of the options. But a pic-
ture is worth a thousand words. Experiment to really see these effects come
alive.
Managing layer styles
Here are a few pointers to keep in mind when working with and editing layer
styles:
 Choose several effects at one time: Simply select the check box for the
effect on the left side of the Layer Style dialog box. To access the options
for each effect, you must click the effect name so that it is highlighted.
 Remove an effect: Deselect the check box associated with it.
 Move a style onto a separate layer: By default, layer styles are attached
to a layer. To put a style on a separate layer, select the styled layer and
choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Create Layer. You see a new layer in the
Layers palette with a name, such as Layer 0’s Drop Shadow.
Although separating a style onto its own layer may give you more
manual editing capability and allow you to apply filters, you lose all
editing ability with the Layer Style dialog box. Also, the style won’t
dynamically update when you change the layer itself. Your style basi-
cally becomes just a generic mass of colored pixels.
 Copy and paste effects onto other layers: Select the layer containing
the effect and choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Copy Layer Style. Select the
layer, or layers, on which you want to apply the effect and choose
Layer➪Layer Style➪Paste Layer Style. Even easier, you can also just
drag and drop an effect from one layer to another.
 Hide effects: Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Hide All Effects.
 Display hidden effects: Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Show All Effects.
You can also click the eye icon next to the style in the Layers palette. If
you don’t see the eyeball, be sure and click the triangle to the right of
the fx symbol on the layer in the Layers palette.
 Remove all the effects on a layer: Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Clear
Layer Style. You can also drag the Effects bar (what Adobe calls the
name Effects), or fx icon, to the trash icon in the Layers palette.
 Remove a single effect: Double-click the effect in the Layers palette and
deselect it in the Layer Style dialog box. You can also just drag and drop
the single effect to the trash icon in the Layers palette.

Managing and Editing Layer Styles
431
 Resize a layer effect: Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Scale Effects. Select
Preview and enter a value between 1 and 1,000 percent. This command
allows you to scale the effect without scaling the element.
Editing drop shadow or inner shadow effects
If you used the default settings to apply your drop shadow or inner shadow
and want to do some tweaking, edit at will by following these steps:
1. In the Layers palette, double-click the Effect name. Or you can also
double-click the layer thumbnail or the Layer Style icon (fx icon).
The Layer Style dialog box opens. If you double-clicked the layer thumb-
nail or the Layer Style icon, you need to select Drop Shadow or Inner
Shadow on the left side of the dialog box.
2. Change the Blend Mode setting to adjust how the colors of the shadow
mix with the colors of your elements.
Usually the default mode of Multiply works best.
3. Adjust the Opacity setting to change how transparent the shadow
appears.
4. To choose a shadow color, open the Color Picker by clicking the
swatch to the right of the Blend Mode setting.
5. Establish the angle of your light source.
6. Select the Use Global Light option to ensure that all the shadows and
highlights of all your elements are consistent.
You don’t want one layer to look like it’s 6 a.m. and another to look like
it’s 2 p.m. The neat thing is that if you change the angle on one layer
style, all the styles you’ve applied to your layers adjust to that new
angle dynamically.
7. Specify how far the shadow is offset from your element with the
Distance setting.
8. Adjust the Spread or Choke and Size settings to specify the boundary,
intensity, and size of the shadow.
9. Select the Layer Knocks Out Drop Shadow option if you have a trans-
parent object on top of the shadow.
This option prevents the shadow from showing through the object.
10. After you refine your effect settings, click OK.
Your effect is edited and ready to go, as shown in Figure 4-6.
You can also choose to apply various contours and noise to your
shadow. See “Playing with Contours,” later in this chapter, for details.

Changing default inner and outer glow effects
The inner and outer glow effects possess many of the same settings as the
shadows. But unlike shadows, glows offer the option of using a gradient.
This can produce an interesting halo effect, as shown in Figure 4-7. 
PhotoSpin
Figure 4-7: Colorize a glow with a gradient.
Follow these steps to edit your own glow:
1. Double-click the layer thumbnail or the Layer Style icon (fx icon).
The Layer Style dialog box opens.

Editing Bevel and Emboss Effects
433
2. Specify Blend Mode, Opacity, Color, Spread, and Size settings.
If you are editing an inner glow effect, you see the options of Source
(Center or Edge) and Choke rather than Spread. The Center option
applies the glow over the entire image except the edge, whereas the
Edge option applies only to the element’s edge. The Choke option
behaves similarly to the way the Spread option behaves.
3. Choose a preset gradient from the Gradient drop-down palette or
click the Gradient Editor button to edit or create your own gradient.
Book IV, Chapter 2 explains the Gradient Editor in detail.
4. In the Technique option, choose either the Softer or Precise setting.
Choose Softer to apply a blurred glow. This option doesn’t preserve
detailed edges of the element.
Choose Precise to create a glow that is good for hard-edge elements,
such as type. This option does preserve the details.
5. Use the Range and Jitter options for the Contour setting.
For more on contours, see the “Playing with Contours” section, later in
this chapter.
6. After you refine your effect settings, click OK.
Your effect is edited and ready to rock.
Editing Bevel and Emboss Effects
Because Photoshop offers five bevel and emboss styles, you have, of course,
a ton of options. Some are similar to those found with the shadow and glow
effects, whereas others are unique. The Layer Style dialog box is divided
into four panels.
Structure
This panel contains the most relevant options:
 The Technique settings of Smooth, Chisel Hard, or Chisel Soft deter-
mine how soft or hard the edge of the bevel is. Chisel Hard works well
with type and harder-edged elements. You can see an example of each in
Figure 4-8. I used a depth of 700% and a size of 8.
 Depth affects how raised or sunken the edge of the bevel or pattern
appears.
 For the Direction settings, Up positions the highlight along the edge
closest to the light source and the shadow on the opposite edge. Down
does the opposite, positioning the shadow near the light source.

Figure 4-8: Choose from three types of bevels.
 Size controls the size of the bevel or emboss effect.
 Soften blurs the shading of the effect.
 Angle is the same as with Drop Shadow.
Shading
Because of the 3-D nature of bevel and emboss effects, Photoshop has set-
tings for Highlight and Shadow (each with separate Blend Modes and Opacity
options) and Depth. Because bevels and embosses are more dimensional, an
additional setting of Altitude affects the light source.
Texture
In the Texture panel (click Texture on the left side
of the dialog box), you can apply a pattern onto
your layer that creates a texture, as shown in
Figure 4-9. Adjust the scale and depth of the pat-
tern, and link the pattern to the layer if desired. If
you link the pattern and layer, the pattern moves
when you move the layer. The Snap to Origin com-
mand aligns the pattern origin with the document
if you have selected the Link with Layer option. If
you don’t select the option, the Snap to Origin
command aligns the pattern to the upper-left
corner of the layer.

Changing Overlay Effects
435
Contour
Contours change the distribution of the colors in
the effect, as shown in Figure 4-10. You can use
the various presets offered to create interesting,
and sometimes bizarre, shadows, glows, bevels,
and other effects. For details on contour and its
various iterations, see the upcoming section,
“Playing with Contours.”
Editing Satin Effects
You can adjust the blend modes, opacity, angle,
distance, and size — all of which I explain in the
preceding sections. You can also adjust the contour, which is discussed
later in “Playing with Contours.”
Changing Overlay Effects
Shadows, being based in reality, are the kinds of effects you will find yourself
using frequently. On the other hand, you’ll probably use overlay effects only
occasionally, if at all. In most cases, overlays are reserved for the realm of
the special effect. But in case you need to apply an overlay, here are the
options:
 Color Overlay: Adjust the Blend Mode, Opacity, and Color settings of
the overlay. This effect, along with the Gradient Overlay and Pattern
Overlay, is best used with an opacity setting of less than 100% or a
Blend Mode other than Normal. That way, the elements underneath
aren’t totally obliterated.
 Gradient Overlay: Choose a preset gradient from the drop-down
Gradient picker, or click the Gradient swatch to access the Gradient
Editor to create your own. The Align with Layer option uses the bound-
ing box of the layer to calculate the gradient. Specify the angle, style
(Linear or Radial), and scale of the gradient. Reverse flips the gradient.
Adjust the Blend Modes and Opacity settings.
 Pattern Overlay: Choose a preset pattern from the Pattern picker drop-
down palette. Snap to Origin and Link with Layer work the same as with
Bevel and Emboss. Choose Blend Modes and Opacity settings. Figure 4-11
shows a fabric pattern overlay on a rose.

Changing Stroke Effects

Figure 4-11: I created this fabric rose with the Denim pattern 
and an Overlay blend mode.
Changing Stroke Effects
Specify the size of your stroke in pixels and whether you want it to ride the
outside, center, or inside of the edge of the element. Determine the Blend
Mode and Opacity settings. And finally, specify whether to fill your stroke
with a color, gradient, or pattern. Choose your desired color, gradient, or
pattern from the corresponding options
Playing with Contours
Several of the layer effects have various options for contours. Contours
change the distribution of the colors in the effect. The default setting for all
the effects, except satin, is linear contour. In an effect with a linear contour,
the opacity drops off in a straight line.
But you’re not limited to the linear contour option. Click the arrow of the
Contour option, and you find a variety of preset contours, as shown in
Figure 4-12. Click the palette arrow, and you can load the complete contour
preset library by selecting Contours at the bottom of the submenu. You can
also click the Load Contours command to load other libraries you may have
saved previously or acquired from friends, colleagues, or third-party vendors.

Playing with Contours
437
Figure 4-12: Choose from a wide assortment of preset contours for your layer styles.
The presets offer contours like ring, rolling, sawtooth, and steps, all of
which create rings of transparency within the shadows and glows. If you 
use contours with bevel and emboss effects, you can create nooks, crannies,
bumps, and lumps that are highlighted and shaded.
You can also find options for naming and deleting contours as well as
saving, loading, resetting, and replacing contour libraries. Choosing differ-
ent contours can create fun and funky shadows and glow, as shown in 
Figure 4-13.

Adjusting contour settings
Of course, you’re using Photoshop, the Swiss Army Knife of the graphics-
editing world, so you can do a whole lot more than choose a preset contour
and apply it to a layer. Depending on the effect you’re working with, you can
change the appearance of the contour in a variety of ways:
 Noise: Randomizes the colors of selected pixels in the drop shadow to
give a gritty effect.
 Anti-aliasing: Slightly softens the edge pixels of a contour.
 Range: Controls how much of the glow is targeted for the contour.
Reduce the Range setting to get a less feathered, tighter, and larger
glow.
 Jitter: Doesn’t affect the appearance of the default glow, but with other
gradients, the Jitter setting varies the color and opacity of selected
pixels to give a roughened effect.
 Invert: Turns the colors of the satin effect inside out.
 Gloss Contour: Changes the distribution of color in the effect over the
layer. It creates a metallic effect when used with the Bevel and Emboss
styles. The indented Contour option, which appears below the Bevel
and Emboss style in the Styles list, does the same for the edges of the
layer. It creates shaded and highlighted nooks and crannies when used
with the Bevel and Emboss styles.

Applying and Modifying Preset Styles
439
Modifying contours with the Contour Editor
If the preset contours just don’t do it for you, feel free to create your own by
following these steps:
1. Open the Contour Editor dialog
box, shown in Figure 4-14, by
clicking the Contour thumbnail in
the Layer Style dialog box. 
2. Click the line on the mapping 
line to add points and drag 
the line to adjust the slope.
You can also select a point on the
mapping line and enter values in
the Input and Output boxes.
3. To create a sharp corner instead
of a curve, select a point and
click the Corner option. 
4. When you have the contour to
your liking, click the New button,
give it a name, as shown in Fig-
ure 4-15, and click OK. 
Photoshop saves your custom
contour as a preset and makes it
available in the Contour palette.
You can save custom contours for
reloading later or for trading with
friends and neighbors. (Try giving them away on Halloween.) Photoshop
saves contours as a .shc file in the Contours folder in the Presets folder in
the Photoshop application folder.
Applying and Modifying Preset Styles
In addition to layer effects, Photoshop also offers you a multitude of preset
layer styles that you can access via the Styles palette, shown in Figure 4-16.
You can also access these styles by using the Style picker drop-down palette
on the Options bar, when the Pen or shape tools are active and you have the
Shape Layer option selected. And you find the Styles palette nestled in the
Layer Style dialog box as well.

Here are the many splendid ways to apply a preset style:
 Select the layer and click a style in the Styles palette.
 Drag and drop a style from the Styles palette onto a layer in the Layers
palette.
 Drag and drop a style directly onto the image window. When your
cursor is over the element to which you want to apply the style, release
your mouse button.
 Double-click the layer thumbnail in the Layers palette. Select Styles in
the upper-left side of the Layer Style dialog box. Choose a style from the
palette. Click OK to close the Layer Style dialog box.
 If you’re using the Pen or one of the shape tools, select the Shape Layer
option. Then select a style from the Style picker drop-down palette on
the Options bar before drawing the shape.
By default, applying a style over another style replaces it. To add a style
along with another, press the Shift key while clicking or dragging the style.
Managing preset styles
Here are some additional points to remember when using the Styles palette.
You can do any of the following:
 Load another Style preset library: In the Styles palette, the Style picker
drop-down palette, or the palette in the Layer Style dialog box, you can
choose Load Styles from the palette pop-up menu to add a library to
your current preset list (refer to Figure 4-16). Select the library and click
Load. You can also choose Replace Styles. Even easier, just choose a
preset library from the bottom of the menu and click OK to replace or
append your current list.
 Use the Preset Manager to load preset style libraries: You can also
rename, delete, and save whole libraries of presets. See Book I, Chapter 5.
 Return to the default library of presets: Choose Reset Styles.
 Choose a viewing option for your palette: You can choose Small or
Large Thumbnail or Small or Large List. And, of course, there’s also Text
Only, but what fun is it if you can’t see the presets?
 Rename a preset style: Double-click the style in the Styles palette. If
you’re in Thumbnail view, type a new name in the dialog box and click
OK. If the view is set to list, simply type a new name directly and press
Enter (Return on the Mac). You can also choose Rename Style from the
Picker in the Layer Style dialog box, or the Style picker drop-down
palette on the Options bar. Or if you like, click the Rename button in the
Preset Manager.

 Save a set of preset styles as a library: Choose Save Styles from the
Styles palette pop-up menu, from the Layer Style dialog box pop-up
menu, or from the Style picker drop-down palette pop-up menu on the
Options bar. Name the library, navigate to the Styles folder in the
Presets folder in the Photoshop folder, and click Save.
 Delete a preset style: Drag the style to the trash can icon in the Styles
palette or Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) the style. You can also
choose Delete Style from the Layer Style dialog box, or the Style picker
drop-down palette on the Options bar.
 To clear a style (that is, remove it from the layer): Click the Clear Style
button in the Styles palette. You can also click the Default Style (None)
swatch in the stand-alone Styles palette or the ones located in the Layer
Style dialog box or on the Options bar.
 Change the style or color of the currently active shape layer: Click the
link icon on the Options bar and select a different style or color. This
option allows you to experiment with different styles for that shape.
Also, the color swatch on the Options bar changes as the foreground
color changes.
Conversely, deselect the link icon, and Photoshop won’t change the style
of the active shape layer when you select a different style. This option
allows you to choose a different style or color for a new shape layer with-
out affecting the previous shape layer. If you have the link icon deselected,
the active shape layer determines the color swatch on the Options bar.
Saving your own style
If you get bored using the preset style libraries or if you really went to town
and created a custom style that you think is so fabulous that you’ll want to
use it again and again, you can easily save it to the Styles palette. Here’s all
you need to know about saving custom styles:
1. Create your own custom style by applying layer effects and/or styles
to your layer.
Starting with an existing preset style and modifying the settings to suit
your needs is also easy. 
2. After you complete your style, click the Create New Style button in
the Styles palette or choose New Style from the palette pop-up menu.
You can also drag your selected layer from the Layers palette onto the
Styles palette or simply click in an empty space in the Styles palette. Or
you can double-click the layer thumbnail to open the Layer Style dialog
box where you can click the New Style button.

Applying and Modifying Preset Styles

3. In the New Style dialog box, shown in Figure 4-17, name your style
and select your desired options.
The Include Layer Effects check box includes any effects you applied 
via the Effects section of the Layer Style dialog box — drop shadows,
bevels, and so on.
The Include Layer Blending Options check box includes any blending
you did using the Blending Options section of the Layer Styles palette.
Photoshop adds your new style to the end of the Styles palette. If you
wish to edit your custom style, you must select each individual effect in
the Layers palette and adjust the settings in the Layer Styles dialog box.
Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) to create a new style and bypass the
dialog box. Your style gets the default name of Style 1.

Clipping Layers into Masks

Clipping Layers into Masks
In a clipping mask, the bottommost layer, also known as the base layer, acts
as a mask for the layers above it. The layers in the group clip to the opaque
areas of the base layer and do not show over the transparent areas of the
base layer.
At this point, you might be saying, “Huh?” Rather than trying to decipher
the definition, a better way to understand a clipping mask is to just create
one. Follow the steps in this section, and I know that instead of “Huh,” you’ll
be saying “Yeah, baby,” just like Austin Powers.
Creating a clipping mask works well if you want to fill type with different
images on multiple layers.
Using the steps that follow, I created a new document with a white back-
ground. I took the Custom Shape tool and, choosing the Fill Region option
(see Book IV, Chapter 1 for more on shapes), drew a heart on my second
layer. I then added a drop shadow and inner bevel to my heart for added
dimension, but this step isn’t mandatory.
I then opened an image of an island and dragged and dropped that image
onto my composite. I opened an image of some dolphins, selected a couple
dolphins, and dragged and dropped them onto my composite.
And, finally, I created some type and applied a drop shadow and inner bevel
to the type, as shown in Figure 4-18.
Follow these steps to create your own clipping group:
1. Open or create an image that has several layers.
2. Press Alt (Option on the Mac) and position your mouse cursor over
the line dividing two layers in the Layers palette.
Your cursor changes to two overlapping circles with a small arrow icon.
You can also choose Layer➪Create Clipping Mask. 
3. Click your mouse button.
I did this three times: in between my type and the dolphin layer, in
between the dolphin and the island layer, and in between the island layer
and my heart shape. Notice how all my images and my type clip to the
base layer (the heart shape) in the Layers palette (refer to Figure 4-18).
Nothing outside the boundaries of the heart shape is visible on any of
the layers in the clipping mask, as shown in Figure 4-18. The down-
pointing arrow icon indicates that the layers are clipped. The clipping
group takes on the opacity and blend mode of the base layer.

Managing clipping masks
Here is some clipping mask trivia:
 To remove a single layer from the clipping
mask, you can simply Alt+click (Option+
click) the line between the two layers in the
Layers palette. Or you can select the layer
and choose Layer➪Release Clipping Mask.
Both commands remove the selected layer
and any layers above it from the clipping
group.
 To ungroup all the layers in the clipping
mask, select the base layer and choose
Layer➪Release Clipping Mask.
 You can also apply clipping masks to adjust-
ment and fill layers. If you clip between a
regular layer and an adjustment layer, or a
regular layer and a fill layer, the adjustment
or fill layer affects only the pixels of the
adjacent underlying layer, instead of all the
underlying layers. For more on adjustment
and fill layers, see Book V, Chapter 1.

Putting It Together
Adding Text and Layer Styles to a Collage
If you’ve been reading Book V faithfully, then you may have a nearly complete collage on
your hands. If you’re at all interested in using words with your images, then now (at the
end of the project, not the beginning) is the time to add them. Adding type can turn a
good composite into a dynamite and cohesive image that conveys exactly what you
want. I’m no Shakespeare and can’t help you create the perfect tag line, but I can show
you how to add text to your collage. Adding layer styles gives you versatility in the kinds
of effects you can apply to styles, so I show you how to apply those to a collage. To add
and adjust type, follow these steps:
1. Open the saved collage file.
Make sure that the Layers palette is open.
2. Select the Eyedropper tool from the Tools palette. Click a color in the collage that
you like.
The color you sampled is now the foreground color.
3. Select the Type tool. On the Options bar, select a font, style, point size, and other
formatting options.
I recommend choosing an easy-to-read serif font and applying a bold style to it. I’m
using Times Bold, and I set the point size to 100.
I set the anti-aliasing to Crisp and the Alignment to Left, but you can explore your
options until you’re dizzy (or your deadline passes).
4. Click inside your image and type some text.
I typed Go outside for my travel collage.
5. Select the Move tool from the Tools palette and position the type in the collage.
I put my text in the upper-left corner.
6. Adjust your settings as you desire.
If you want to add a second, smaller line of text, grab the Type tool again and reduce
the point size from the Options bar. You can change other settings, as well.
7. When you’re satisfied with your changes, click under the first line of text and type
your next line.
Under Go outside, I typed and play, as shown in the figure.
With the Move tool, fine-tune the position of the type.

Getting Jazzy with
Layer Styles and
Clipping Groups
When you’re satisfied with the size, style, color, and appearance of the type in your col-
lage, you can make some more large-scale changes by creating layer styles. Follow
these steps:
1. Add a drop shadow and make sure that you have selected Use Global Light so that
all the layers use the same angle.
In the Layers palette, first select the layer that includes the first line of text. Then
choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Drop Shadow. Make sure the Drop Shadow box is
selected in the left column.
You can change the angle so that the light source is coming from one direction or
another (mine’s set at 120% so that the light’s coming from the upper left).
2. Add bevels and embossing.
Click the Bevel and Emboss style in the left column.
Make sure that you actually select the style and not just the box; otherwise, the
right panel with all the options won’t appear.
In my example, I selected Inner Bevel from the Style pop-up menu in the right panel.
Then I selected Chisel Soft from the Technique pop-up menu. My idea was to give
the type a carved-in-stone look.
3. Click OK when you’re satisfied with the styles you’ve created in the layer so far.
4. Apply the same styles to the layer where the second line of text is, as shown in the
figure.

To get the exact same settings without having to make every adjustment again,
right-click (Control+click on the Mac) the fx icon on the first layer you worked on
and choose Copy Layer Style from the context menu. Select the second type layer
and right-click (Control+click on the Mac) on the layer name and choose Paste
Layer Style from the context menu.
5. Make any last adjustments and choose File➪Save.
You’re all done. If you feel like it, keep adding to or refining the collage as you learn
new tricks.

with Smart Objects

 Creating Smart Objects
 Converting Smart Objects
 Editing Smart Objects
W
ith the advent of Smart Objects, Photoshop has significantly cut your
editing time while letting you transform your objects indefinitely
without fear of quality loss. That’s right. Vector files, raster files—it doesn’t
matter to these intelligent fellows. And with Smart Objects, you create the
art once and then if you want to show the art again, you use what are called
instances. These instances can be linked to your original art. This
makes editing a breeze. Read on to find out more about this
feature — the ultimate in digital recycling.
Introducing Smart Objects
A Smart Object is actually what Adobe refers to as
a container, in which a bitmap (raster) or vector
image’s source data is embedded. So in essence, a
Smart Object is composed of two files, one inside
the other. Adobe uses the analogy of a new file, the
child, which is embedded into the original file, the
parent. This source data of the child is contained in
the Smart Object parent but keeps all its native charac-
teristics and is fully editable.
Here are a few advantages of Smart Objects:
 Transform with minimum degradation. In Book III, Chapter 3, I warn
you about the negative side of transformations. When transforming tra-
ditional layers, your image goes through the process of resampling,
which then causes degradation of quality. With Smart Objects, you can
perform multiple transformations on your artwork without losing any
additional image quality. Photoshop does this by actually using your
original source data to render the additional transformations.

Creating Smart Objects
450
 Preserve non-native file data. Photoshop transforms any non-native
image information, such as Illustrator vector artwork for example, into
a format it can recognize without altering the native data.
 Edit the Smart Object and all instances are dynamically updated. If you
make changes to the original Smart Object, all instances (duplicates of the
original) are automatically changed as well. No need to change them indi-
vidually. This can be a real timesaver, especially if you’ve gone crazy with
the number of instances you’ve used, such as on a map or Web home page.
 Version CS3 has given Smart Objects even more prestige. Layers must
first be converted to Smart Objects before you can apply the new Smart
Filters. Smart Filters are a totally non-destructive way to apply filters
which can then be edited indefinitely. For details on this great new fea-
ture, see Book VII, Chapter 1.
Creating Smart Objects
You can create a Smart Object in a few ways. You can import the artwork 
via the Place command. You can also copy and paste the artwork from
Illustrator into Photoshop. Or you can convert a Photoshop layer into a
Smart Object. Finally, you can create one Smart Object from another. I dis-
cuss the specific steps for each way in the following sections.
Placing artwork
You may not have much experience in using the Place command in
Photoshop because most activities involve opening images and creating
new ones. But with the advent of Smart Objects, you may call on this com-
mand more frequently. Here’s the scoop on placing artwork:
1. Choose File➪New and create a
new blank Photoshop document
using your desired size and 
settings.
If you’re unsure about creating a
new file, see Book I, Chapter 3. You
can also use an existing Photoshop
file.
2. Choose File➪Place. Locate and
select your desired artwork.
Click the Place button.
If your file is in any format besides
Illustrator or PDF, it pops right
onto your canvas, as shown in
Figure 5-1. Note the bounding box
Figure 5-1: Create a Smart Object by
placing your artwork into a Photoshop file.

Creating Smart Objects
451
and X around and across the
image, which is an indication that
the image has been placed.
If your file is a native Illustrator 
or PDF file you get the Place PDF
dialog box asking you for addi-
tional information, as shown in
Figure 5-2. If it is a multipaged PDF
you can select the pages or images
you want placed. Select your crop-
ping options. Not sure what they
mean? Just choose one and view
the thumbnail to see how the image
appears in relationship to the page.
By the way, you can also choose
between a Small, Large, and Fit
Page thumbnail view.
If you happen to deselect the
Create PDF Compatible File option
when saving your native Illustrator
file, you see a nasty warning in the
Place PDF dialog box telling you to
go back and resave your file with
the option checked and then place
the file again. Don’t take it person-
ally. Illustrator was programmed
based on PDF core code and some-
times doesn’t like it when you strip
it of the connection. 
You can also select the image in the
Bridge and choose File➪Place➪In
Photoshop. See Book I, Chapter 5 for details on working with the Bridge.
3. Using the bounding box, transform (scale, rotate, and so on) your
image to your desired dimensions and position it on your canvas, as
shown in Figure 5-3. Remember you can rest assured that your trans-
formations are applied without degrading the quality of your image.
Note that if your image is larger than the Photoshop canvas, it’s auto-
matically sized to fit within the canvas dimensions. If you need a
refresher on transforming and moving, see Book III, Chapter 3.
If you are placing a PDF, EPS (most of them), or native Illustrator file,
specify the Anti-alias option on the Options bar. Check it to create a
softer, blended edge. Uncheck it to produce a hard edge.

4. After you have your image the
way you want it, either double-
click inside the bounding box,
press Enter (Return on the Mac),
or click the Commit (check mark
icon) button on the Options bar.
When the artwork is committed,
the native file data is embedded
into the Photoshop file and the
artwork is rasterized on its own
layer. You’ll notice the Smart
Object icon appears on those
layers, as shown in Figure 5-4.
If you change your mind and don’t
want to commit the image, press
Esc or click the Cancel button on
the Options bar.
Copying and pasting
Before you copy and paste artwork from Illustrator into Photoshop as a
Smart Object, be sure and check the PDF and AICB (no transparency sup-
port) options in the File Handling and Clipboard preferences in Illustrator.
Leave the default of Preserve Appearances and Overprints checked. By
doing so, you can control how your artwork is
rasterized in Photoshop. If left unchecked,
Photoshop rasterizes the art without your vital
input.
1. Open your desired Adobe Illustrator file in
Illustrator.
2. Select your artwork and choose Edit➪Copy.
3. Switch to Photoshop. Open your desired
Photoshop document or create a new 
document.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste.
5. In the Paste dialog box, shown in Figure 5-5,
select the Smart Object option and click OK.
Your image is imported and appears in a
bounding box, and the Layers palette shows
that you pasted the image as a Smart Object,
as shown in Figure 5-5.

6. Using the bounding box, transform (scale, rotate, and so on) your
image to your desired dimensions and position it on your canvas. 
Perspective, Distort and Warp transformations are unavailable to Smart
Objects.
If you chose Smart Object in the Paste dialog box in Step 4, remember
that you can transform your artwork, without degradation before plac-
ing it into Photoshop. Like with the Place command, the native file data
is embedded into the Photoshop file, and the art is rasterized on its own
layer after the artwork is committed.
7. Commit the artwork by either double-clicking inside the bounding
box, press Enter (Return on the Mac), or click the Commit (check
mark icon) button on the Options bar.
Converting a layer into a Smart 
Object and vice versa
If you want to convert a layer into a Smart Object, follow these steps:
1. Select your desired layer in the Layers palette.
2. Choose Layer➪Smart Objects➪Convert to Smart Object.
You can also choose the command from the Layers palette pop-up
menu. After you convert a layer into a Smart Object, you see the Smart
Object icon in the lower-right corner of the layer thumbnail.
You can also convert a Smart Object into a layer. You may want to do this if
you need to paint on or apply filters to your artwork. Here’s how to make
the conversion:
1. Select your desired layer in the Layers palette.
2. Choose Layer➪Rasterize➪Smart Object.
Note that your Smart Object is rasterized at its current size, so be sure it
is the size you want before you execute the command. Your Smart Object
icon disappears, and you’re left with a normal, run-of-the mill layer.
Creating one Smart Object from another
Sometimes you may want to use one Smart Object as the basis for another.
Depending on your needs, you can keep the new Smart Object linked or
unlinked to the original. If it remains linked, modifying the original automati-
cally modifies the duplicate. If unlinked, you can modify the original without
changing the duplicate. In addition, you’re free to change the duplicate with-
out worrying about affecting the original. Here’s how to create a Smart
Object from another:

2. Create a duplicate Smart Object that is linked or unlinked to the

A linked object: Choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy.
A new Smart Object layer appears in the Layers palette, as shown in
Figure 5-6.
You can also drag the Smart Object layer over the Create a New Layer icon
at the bottom of the Layers palette. 
Figure 5-6: You can duplicate a Smart Object and either keep it linked or unlinked to its

Editing Smart Objects
455
Editing Smart Objects
One of the great things about Smart Objects is that you can edit the con-
tents, or source data. If the source content is a vector-based PDF, AI, or EPS
file and was prepared in Illustrator, it opens in that program. If the source
content is raster-based and created in Photoshop, the file opens in Photo-
shop. (For details on vector versus raster images, see Book II, Chapter 1.)
Here’s the 411 on how to edit the contents of a Smart Object:
1. In your document, select the Smart Object layer in the Layers Palette.
2. Choose Layer➪Smart Objects➪Edit Contents. Or you can simply
double-click the Smart Objects layer thumbnail in the Layers palette.
A dialog box appears telling you to save your changes and to save the
file in the same location.
3. Click OK to close the dialog box.
The Smart Object opens in the 
program in which it was created,
either Illustrator or Photoshop.
4. Edit your file ad nauseum.
5. Choose File➪Save to incorporate
the edits. 
6. Close your source file.
7. Return to your Photoshop docu-
ment, which contains your Smart
Object. 
If all goes as expected, all
instances of the Smart Object are
updated. For example, my butter-
flies went from purple in Figure 5-6
to blue in Figure 5-7.
Replacing contents
When editing the contents of a Smart Object, you automatically update all
instances of that Smart Object in your document. This can be a real produc-
tivity enhancer. Just follow these short steps:
1. Select the Smart Object in the Layers palette.
2. Choose Layer➪Smart Objects➪Replace Contents.
3. Locate your file and click the Place button.
Book V

4. Click OK, if presented with a
dialog box, and the new contents
pop into place in the Smart
Object container, as shown in
Figure 5-8.
You find that all instances of that
Smart Object are also updated in
your document.
To replace the contents of a single
instance of a Smart Object, you
have to make sure that the Smart
Object is not linked to other Smart
Objects. To create an unlinked
Smart Object, select the Smart
Object instance you wish to
change, choose Layer➪Smart
Objects➪New Smart Object via
Copy. Make your desired replace-
ment and then delete the original
Smart Object.
Exporting contents
You can export your Smart Object and save it to a hard drive or external
media. Photoshop will export the contents of your Smart Object in its origi-
nal placed format, such as JPEG, native Illustrator (.ai), TIFF, PDF and so on.
Here are the steps:
1. Select the Smart Object in the Layers palette.
2. Choose Layer➪Smart Objects➪Export Contents. 
3. In the Save dialog box, navigate to your destination and click Save.
Note that if your Smart Object was created from layers, it will export in
the PSB format. Remember, you can open the .psb file only in
Photoshop. It won’t open in another program.
The last command under the Smart Objects is Stack Mode. Unfortunately, this
command will only be available in the Extended version. Those in the science,
forensics, medical and pro video fields will probably be thrilled over its 
capabilities. How about the rest of us? Well, using image stacks can help to
decrease the noise in your images across multiple exposures. In this case
noise can be defined, not just as the grainy or wavy little artifacts throughout
your image, but also anything that you don’t want in the picture — cars,
birds, annoying people walking in front of your scenic shot. If this sounds like
something worthwhile for your workflow, it may be worth checking out an
upgrade.

Channels and
Masks

I
f you got the basics down and are ready for
something a little more challenging, this is your
book. Here I help you start working with channels
and creating masks. Creating masks is one of the
most accurate ways to make a selection and is espe-
cially useful in tackling more difﬁcult selections. 
In this book, I show you different ways of creating
a mask, from quick masks to layer masks to chan-
nel masks. If you’ve ever ﬂung your mouse or
stylus pen in frustration because you couldn’t
select the hair on your loved one’s photo, you’ll
be well-served by reading this book and getting up
to speed on masking techniques.

f you’re reading this, it probably means that you didn’t quickly thumb
through this chapter, say “Yuck, boorrrrringgg!” and move on to sexier
topics such as blending, filtering, and retouching. You knew that would be a
huge mistake.
The wonderful thing about channels is that they offer you
greater control and selectivity when doing those very
things — blending, filtering, and retouching. Channels
bring one more level of control when editing your
images. You can use individual channels for layer
blending options, filters, and as starting points for
masks.
Channels also come into play when saving selec-
tions for later use or for adding spot (custom)
colors to your image. You can also use channels to
turn color images into nicely contrasted grayscale
images. And finally, you can play around with the
colors in an image by mixing up the channels. So bear
with me. The topic of channels may be a bit dry and techni-
cal, but in the end, they’ll enable you to hold the envious title of
Master Editor.
To understand how channels work, you’ll find it helpful to know a few things
about colors — specifically the various color modes, which I cover in 
Book II, Chapter 2.

Understanding Channels
460
Understanding Channels
When you look at a color image, you see one big, 24-bit, composite collec-
tion of colored pixels. Technically speaking, however, Photoshop doesn’t
see that at all. Photoshop perceives a color image as individual bands of 
8-bit, grayscale images. RGB images have three bands; CMYK images have
four bands.
I know it’s strange to think of a color image as being composed of several
grayscale images, but it’s true. Each one of these bands, or grayscale images,
is a channel. Specifically, they’re color channels. If you just can’t get past the
fact that a color image is the sum of several grayscale channels, as shown in
Figure 1-1, then just think of channels as holding tanks of color data.
Figure 1-1: A color image is composed of 8-bit grayscale images referred to as channels.
Another way of relating channels to the real world is in terms of hardware.
Here’s how the most common hardware handles color:

Understanding Channels
461
 When you offset print a CMYK image, the process separates the colors
(see Book IX, Chapter 1) into four colors — cyan, magenta, yellow, and
black. Paper passes through four individual rollers on the printing
press, each roller containing one of those four colored inks.
 Scanners scan in RGB via a pass of red, green, and blue sensors over
your image.
 Digital cameras capture images in RGB.
 CRT Screens display images via red, green, and blue tubes.
In addition to color channels, there are channels called alpha channels 
(covered later in this chapter); others are called spot channels (discussed in
Book IX, Chapter 1). Photoshop now supports up to 56 channels per file. So
knock yourself out! Just remember that each channel you add increases
your file size.
Briefly, you can use alpha channels to create, store, and edit selections,
defining them not by a selection outline, but by black, white, and varying
shades of gray pixels — in other words, a grayscale image. Black pixels rep-
resent unselected areas of the image, while white pixels represent selected
areas, and gray pixels represent partially selected pixels.
You can create spot channels when you want to add a spot, or custom, color
to your image. Spot colors are premixed inks often used in addition to or in
lieu of CMYK colors.
Book VI
Chapter 1
Using Channels
A little bit about bit depth
When you’re standing around the water cooler
or the color printer, and you hear people talking
about a 1-bit or an 8-bit image, they’re referring
to something called bit depth. Bit depth meas-
ures how much color information is available 
to display and print each pixel. A higher bit
depth means the image can display more infor-
mation — specifically, more colors. For example,
a 1-bit image can display two color values —
black and white. That’s why a purely black-and-
white image is called a bitmap image. Likewise
 An 8-bit image can contain up to 256
grayscale levels (28). Grayscale images are
8 bit (1 channel, 8 bits).
 A 24-bit image can contain about 16 million
colors (224). RGB images are 24 bit (3 chan-
nels × 8 bits). 
 CMYK images are 32 bit (4 channels × 8 bits).
CMYK images, however, are limited to the
number of colors that are physically repro-
ducible on paper, which is around 55,000.
 High Dynamic Range (HDR) images are 96 bit
(3 channels (RGB) × 32 bits). Theoretically,
they are capable of having about 65 million
colors, but in reality the maximum range is
determined by what colors were captured by
the camera.
Bit depths typically range from 1 to 64 bits.

Working with Channels
462
All images, no matter what their color mode, have at least one channel. Gray-
scale, Duotone, and Indexed Color (for GIF Web images) modes have only one
channel. RGB and CMYK images have three and four channels, respectively.
They also contain a composite channel, which reflects the combination of the
individual color channels and gives you the full color display.
Working with Channels
As with layers, channels have their own palette
that acts as command central for viewing, creat-
ing, and managing tasks. The first step is access-
ing channels by choosing Window➪Channels. The
Channels palette appears, as shown in Figure 1-2.
Viewing channels 
without a remote
Selecting a channel in the Channels palette auto-
matically makes it show. To select a channel, click
the channel thumbnail or name in the palette. To
select more than one channel, Shift+click. To show
or hide a channel, click in the eye column in the far
left of the palette. You can also drag through the
column to hide or show the channels quickly.
CMYK, RGB, and Lab images have a composite channel in addition to their
individual channels. This composite channel is the combination of all the
channels in the image and is named after the color mode. For example, the
composite channel in Figure 1-2 is the first one, called CMYK.
Changing the default channel view
The default setting is to view your channels in grayscale. You can, how-
ever, view them in color. To do so, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Interface
(Photoshop➪Preferences➪Interface on Mac OS X) and select Show
Channels in Color.
Although this option graphically exemplifies the way an image comprises
separate color channels, it really does you no good if you want to work with
your channels for editing. That’s because the color view obscures details
and makes measuring the impact of adjustments and filters more difficult.
You need to see the channels in their true grayscale form for that.
If you select or show more than one channel, even in the default grayscale
view, the channels always appear in color.
Figure 1-2: The Channels
palette stores all of the
image’s channels, including
spot and alpha channels.

Working with Channels
463
To change the size of the thumbnail that appears, choose Palette Options
from the Channels palette pop-up menu. Select your desired thumbnail size.
If you’re working with several channels and you have a dinosaur of a com-
puter, you can also choose None to turn off the thumbnails — to improve its
performance.
Duplicating and deleting channels
Duplicating channels is something you may do quite often. I know I do. And
of course, deleting channels isn’t something you do only if you’re a neat
freak. Channels take up a lot of memory, so getting rid of the ones you no
longer need is always good.
Here are some instances when duplicating channels is a good idea:
 When you want to create a channel mask: First, you find a suitable
channel and then make a duplicate. (For more on this technique, see
Book VI, Chapter 3.) You can use channel masks to select difficult ele-
ments involving fine details, such as hair, fur, smoke, and so on.
 When you want to make a backup copy of the channel before doing
some editing: Having a backup just to be on the safe side is always a
good idea. For example, you may want to apply an Unsharp Mask filter
to one or two channels to improve the focus of the image. For more on
the Unsharp Mask filter, see Book VII, Chapter 1.
 To insert a copy of an alpha channel into another image: For example,
maybe you spent an hour creating elaborate alpha channels for shad-
ows and highlights on a product photographed in flat lighting.
You may have 12 products, all the same shape, but different colors that
you need to apply those highlights and shadows to. Rather than re-cre-
ating the wheel each time, you could simply duplicate the alpha chan-
nels into each file.
Duplicating channels
To duplicate a channel, follow these short steps:
1. Select your desired channel in
the Channels palette.
2. Choose Duplicate Channel from
the palette pop-up menu.
The Duplicate Channel dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 1-3.
Book VI
Chapter 1
Using Channels
Figure 1-3: Name and provide a
destination for your duplicate channel.

Working with Channels
464
3. In the Duplicate section, name the channel.
You can also drag the channel to the New Channel icon at the bottom 
of the palette. If you do this, Photoshop provides a default name and
bypasses Steps 4, 5, and 6.
You can also duplicate a channel to another image by dragging the
channel. Open your destination image and drag the desired channel
from your current image into the destination image window. The dupli-
cated channel appears in the Channels palette.
4. In the Destination section, select a file from the Document drop-down
list. Or choose New to create a new image.
You can choose your current image or any
open image with the same pixel dimensions
(size and resolution) as your current image.
(For more on pixel dimensions, see Book II,
Chapter 1.)
If you choose New, Photoshop creates a new
image that has a single channel. Provide a
name for the file.
5. Select Invert if you want to reverse the
selected and unselected areas of the dupli-
cate channel.
You use the Invert option primarily when you
duplicate an existing alpha channel. For more
on alpha channels, see the upcoming section. 
6. Click OK.
The dialog box closes. Your duplicate channel
appears in the Channels palette, as shown in
Figure 1-4.
Replacing one channel over another
To replace the contents of one channel into another, you can use the copy-
and-paste method. In your current image, select your desired channel.
Choose Select➪All and then Edit➪Copy. Select the channel in the destina-
tion image that you want to replace and choose Edit➪Paste. The pasted
contents of the channel replaces the original contents.
Deleting unwanted channels
To delete an unwanted channel — something you definitely want to do
because channels can eat up a lot of space — select the channel in the
Channels palette and do one of the following:
Figure 1-4: You can
duplicate channels for
masking as well as for
backup purposes.

 Drag the channel to the trash icon at the bottom of the palette.
 Choose Delete Channel from the palette pop-up menu.
 Click the trash icon and then click Yes.
 Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) on the trash can icon.
Rearranging and renaming channels
Although you can’t shuffle or rename color channels, you can do so with
spot and alpha channels. To move a spot or alpha channel, simply drag it up
or down in the Channels palette. When you see a dark line appear where you
want the channel to go, release your mouse button. You can move a spot or
alpha channel above a color channel only in a multichannel image. In short, in a
multichannel image, each channel becomes an independent spot channel,
and the channels no longer have a relationship with each other. Multichannel
images also do not support layers. For more details, see Book II, Chapter 2.
To rename a spot or alpha channel, double-click the name in the Channel
palette and type a new name. You can also choose Palette Options from the
palette pop-up menu.
Splitting channels
You can split the channels of your image into separate images in separate files.
For example in Figure 1-5, you see the Red, Green, Blue, Alpha, and Spot chan-
nels split into individual channels. Choose Split Channels from the palette pop-
up menu. When you do so, your original image closes. The channel files have
the name of your original image plus the channel name. You can split channels
only on a flattened image — in other words, an image with no individual layers.
Figure 1-5: Be sure and save all changes in your original image before you split it because
Photoshop closes your file.

You might want to split channels if you need to save your original file in a
format that doesn’t preserve channels — such as EPS, which doesn’t sup-
port alpha channels — or you may want to split channels to merge them
later on.
Merging channels
You can merge channels into a single image. The channels must be open, in
grayscale mode, and have the same pixel dimensions. You can merge chan-
nels only when they are flattened images and have no layers.
Merging color channels can create some unique special effects. For exam-
ple, by mismatching your channels when you merge them, you can create
bizarre, and sometimes beautiful, color shifts.
To merge channels, follow these steps:
1. Open your channel files and activate any one of them.
2. Choose Merge Channels from the palette pop-up menu.
3. In the Merge Channels dialog
box, choose your desired color
mode, as shown in Figure 1-6.
Any modes that are unavailable
are grayed out. That’s because you
may not have enough channels for
that mode.
4. Enter the number of channels
you want.
When you choose your mode in Step 3, Photoshop automatically fills in
the number of channels for the mode. If you deviate and enter some-
thing different, the file becomes a multichannel file.
5. Click OK.
6. Select your channels in the dialog
box that appears.
In my example, the Merge CMYK
Channels dialog box appears. If
you want to merge the channels
normally, make sure that each
channel matches (Red for Red and
so on). If you want to rearrange the
channels, you can mix them as I did
in Figure 1-7, so that the Cyan chan-
nel is mixed with the Magenta chan-
nel, and so on.
Figure 1-6: Choose the color mode and
number of channels in this dialog box.
Figure 1-7: You can mismatch your
channels when merging them to create a
unique effect.

7. If you are merging into a multichannel
image, click Next. Repeat for each channel.
8. Click OK.
You have now merged your files into a single
image, which appears in your Photoshop
window.
Photoshop closes individual channel files and
merges any spot channels as alpha channels.
Check out Figure 1-8 to see how my sunflower
went from yellow to magenta just by merging
the layers a little differently.
If you have an image with alpha or spot channels,
choose Multichannel from the Mode drop-down
list in Step 3 or Photoshop doesn’t include those
channels in the merged image. After you merge
the image, Photoshop gives all the channels the
names Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Alpha 3, and so on. To get
back to a color composite, choose
Image➪Mode➪RGB Color or CMYK Color.
Using Painting and Editing 
Tools with Channels
Sometimes it’s better to edit individual channels
rather than the composite image. Mediocre
flatbed scanners often reproduce, and digital cameras sometimes capture,
an image that is slightly soft or out of focus. You may want to counteract
that effect by applying an Unsharp Mask or Smart Sharpen filter. Before you
do, you should examine each channel separately. You may find that the Blue
channel contains a lot of garbage — artifacts, dithering, and other nasty
crud.
Blue channels are notorious for acquiring this junk, so try to avoid sharpen-
ing this channel unless you really want to accentuate what’s already ugly.
Instead of applying the Unsharp Mask or Smart Sharpen filter on Blue chan-
nels, select the Red and Green channels and then choose Filter➪Sharpen➪
Unsharp Mask or Smart Sharpen. Similarly, you can apply a Gaussian Blur
filter to a channel to soften the unsightly pattern (called a moiré pattern)
caused by scanning a halftone. (See Book VII, Chapter 1 for more on moiré
patterns, and filters are covered throughout Book VII.)

Using Painting and Editing Tools with Channels

While Unsharp Mask, Smart Sharpen and
Gaussian Blur are a couple of corrective filters
that you’ll use frequently, I also find it useful to
apply a special-effect filter to individual channels.
Sometimes applying a filter to the composite
image produces an effect that’s, well, overdone.
Applying the filter to one or two channels can
produce an effect that is subtler and less in-your-
face. For example, in Figure 1-9, I applied a filter to
just the Blue channel for the flower on the left.
Using individual channels can also be useful for
applying filters that produce monochromatic
images, such as the Graphic Pen or Photocopy fil-
ters. If you apply the filter to the entire image, you
get a black-and-white image. If you apply it to an
individual channel, you retain some color.
You can select a color channel and then edit that
channel by using a painting or editing tool to
paint in the image. Keep these facts in mind:
 Painting with white adds the color channel’s
color at full intensity in the composite image.
 Painting with black removes the color in the
composite image.
 Painting with a value of gray adds color at varying levels of intensity in
the composite image.
For example, if you paint with white on the Blue channel in an existing
image, Photoshop adds more blue to the color composite image. But if you
paint with black, Photoshop adds yellow to the image because when you
remove blue, what’s left is the opposite, or complementary, color — yellow.
To perform this channel magic, select the Brush tool and then choose your
desired brush size from the Options bar. Choose your desired color in the
Color palette. Select the channel you want to edit in the Channels palette.
You can see the results by selecting the composite channel in the Channels
palette. Refer to Figure 1-9 to see how I gave a flower a channel color
makeover.
The results are a little different if you try this technique on a blank CMYK
canvas. When you paint with black on the Cyan channel, your composite
color image displays cyan. When you paint with white, you get no change.
Figure 1-9: By editing
individual color channels, you
can selectively and subtly
apply filters (top) or adjust
color (bottom).

Introducing Alpha Channels
469
Introducing Alpha Channels
You use alpha channels for selections that are incredibly detailed or that
you want to save and reuse. To make that selection, an alpha channel uses
black, white, and shades of gray to create a mask. The selected pixels are
white, and unselected pixels are black. For example, in the alpha channel 
of the image shown in Figure 1-10, the selection includes the lanterns and
trees; they appear white in the alpha channel. If an alpha channel includes
gray areas, those areas are partially selected or partially unselected,
depending on whether you think the glass is half full or half empty. The 
gray areas are selected but appear translucent.
Figure 1-10: The alpha channel makes selecting this shape 
much easier than using the Lasso or Magic Wand tool.
You can create a mask by first duplicating a color channel and then editing
that channel with painting and editing tools and filters. (See Book VI,
Chapter 3 for more on channel masks.) You can also create an alpha channel
by saving a selection you’ve created. After you create a channel mask or
save a selection as an alpha channel, you can load that channel to use it as a

selection in any image. The following sections explain how to save a selec-
tion as an alpha channel and load a selection. See Book VI, Chapter 3 for
more on creating channel masks by duplicating an existing color channel.
Saving a selection as an alpha channel
One of the great things about alpha channels is that you can save them and
then retrieve them time and time again. This can be especially handy if you’ve
taken a lot of time and effort to create the selection. Why reinvent the wheel 
if you want to select the element again in the future? Sure, you can create a
mask using Quick Mask mode and Color Range (see Book VI, Chapter 2), but
those masks are only temporary.
After you make the initial selection, saving it is a piece of cake. Follow these
steps:
1. Make a selection in your image.
2. Choose Select➪Save Selection.
You can also click the Save Selection as Channel button (a circle on a
square icon) at the bottom of the Channels palette. A new channel
appears with the default name of Alpha 1 and bypasses Steps 3 and 4.
3. Choose a destination image in the Document pop-up menu. 
You can choose your current image or any other open image with the
same pixel dimensions.
4. Choose a destination channel from the Channel pop-up menu. 
You can choose a new channel or any existing channel or layer mask.
(See Book VI, Chapter 3 for more on layer masks.)
• If you choose New, name the
channel.
• If you choose an existing alpha
channel or layer mask, select
your desired operation:
Replace, Add to, Subtract from,
or Intersect. These commands
add to, subtract from, or inter-
sect your current selection with
the existing alpha channel.
5. Click OK.
Your alpha channel is complete
and appears in the Channels
palette, as shown in Figure 1-11.

Using the Channel Mixer

Loading an alpha channel
No doubt if you’ve gone through the trouble of creating an alpha channel,
it’s because you want to easily load, or access, the selection again and again.
To load an alpha channel, use any one of these many methods:
 Choose Select➪Load Selection. Select your document and channel. Click
Invert to swap selected and unselected areas. If your image has an
active selection, choose how you want to combine the selections.
 Select the alpha channel in the Channels palette, click the Load Channel
as Selection icon at the bottom of the palette, and then click the com-
posite channel.
 Drag the channel to the Load Channel as Selection icon.
 Ctrl+Click (Ô+Click on the Mac) the alpha channel in the Channels palette.
 Ctrl+Shift+Click (Ô+Shift+Click on the Mac) to add the alpha channel to
an active selection.
 Ctrl+Alt+Click (Ô+Option+Click on the Mac) to subtract the alpha chan-
nel from an active selection.
 Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Click (Ô+Option+Shift+Click on the Mac) to intersect the
alpha channel with an active selection.
Adding channels can start to bloat your file size, so use them, but use them
judiciously. The Photoshop native format and TIFF format compress channel
information and therefore are good file formats to use when working with a
lot of channels. The only formats that preserve alpha channels are
Photoshop, TIFF, PDF, PICT, Pixar, Photoshop Raw. BMP, TGA (Targa), and
PSB (Photoshop large format). 
Using the Channel Mixer
The Channel Mixer actually does what its name implies — it mixes color
channels. This feature lets you repair bad channels and produce grayscale
images from color images. It also allows you to create tinted images and
more intense special effects. Finally, it allows you to do the more mundane
tasks of swapping or duplicating channels. 
Although some Photoshop elitists worldwide tout this as an advanced fea-
ture not to be mucked with by amateurs, I say, “Give it a whirl.” Intimidation
is a nasty roadblock to creative fun. Just make a backup copy of an image
before diving into the mix:
1. Select the composite channel in the Channels palette.
If you have an RGB image, the composite channel is the RGB channel;
for CMYK images, the CMYK channel.
Book VI
Chapter 1
Using Channels

Using the Channel Mixer

2. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Channel Mixer.
The Channel Mixer dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 1-12.
3. If desired, choose a Preset from
the pop-up menu. CS3 now pro-
vides an assortment of Black and
White presets which you can use
to convert your color images to
grayscale. This is a great conver-
sion method because it preserves
detail and provides better con-
trast control.
4. For Output Channel, choose the
channel in which to blend one or
more source (existing) channels.
For example, if your Blue channel is lousy, select it from the Output
Channel drop-down list.
5. Drag any source channel’s slider to the left to decrease the channel’s
effect on the Output channel. Or drag to the right to increase the effect.
Because my Blue channel contains artifacts and dithering picked up by
the scanner, I am raising the Red and Green values from 0% to 25% and
lowering the Blue value from 100% to 50%. To retain good contrast, try to
use a combo of Red, Green, and Blue values that add up to close to 100%.
You can also enter a value from –200% to +200%. Using a negative value
inverts the color data of the source channel.
6. Tinker with the Constant option to add a black or white channel of
varying opacity.
Drag the slider to a negative value to get a Black channel. Positive
values give a White channel.
This option brightens or darkens the overall image. I recommend leav-
ing it at 0 most of the time. But try it. It may help.
7. Select Monochrome to apply the same settings to all output channels
producing a color image that has only values of gray. This is another
great way to produce a grayscale image from a color image.
Adjust the individual sliders to mix the values until you are satisfied
with the contrast.
You can save (and load) any of your custom settings by clicking on the
Preset Option button just to the left of the OK button.

8. Click OK to exit the Channel Mixer.
After you exit the Channel Mixer, choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale to
complete the conversion.
If you select and then deselect the Monochrome option, you can modify
the blend of each channel separately. By doing so, you can create color
images that appear to be hand-tinted with color inks. Go for the subtle
treatment or a more intensely colored look.
Swapping color channels can produce some bizarre color effects. For
example, try selecting the Red channel from the Output Channel drop-
down list. Set the Red source channel to 0 and then set the Green source
channel to 100. Try other combinations, Green for Blue, Blue for Red,
and so on. Sometimes they can be downright freakish, but occasionally
you may stumble on one that’s worthy.

Using Channels
Putting It Together
Giving Flat Art Highlights and Shadows
Sometimes you need to give your art — whether it’s a photo or another type of image —
a little shine and shadow to bring it to life. You can do this by creating and saving your
selections as alpha channels and filling them with translucent color. The great thing
about alpha channels is that because you save them with your document, you can use
them time and time again. Just follow these steps:
1. Create a simple piece of artwork to use as a basis
for your shadows and highlights.
I created a pool ball by creating two layers. On each
layer, I used the Elliptical Marquee tool to create 
different-sized circles. I filled each circle with a
separate color, as shown in the figure. To follow
along with these steps, you can download this
image from this book’s Web site (see the
Introduction for details).
2. Choose Window➪Channels.
The Channels palette appears.
Be sure to keep this palette visible because you will be creating new channels for
the highlights.
continued

Using the Channel Mixer
474
3. Choose the Pen tool from the Tools palette and create a path for the highlight.
I created a path for the highlight on the top-left portion of the ball in my example,
assuming that the light source is coming from the upper-left corner. If the Pen tool
seems like a foreign object to you, check out Book III, Chapter 2.
4. Choose Window➪Paths. 
The Paths palette appears.
5. Click the Load Path as Selection icon (a dotted circle) at the bottom of the Paths
palette.
You see your work path disappear and a selection marquee appear.
6. Choose Select➪Save Selection.
The Save Selection dialog box appears.
7. Name the channel. Make sure the channel is new and click OK.
An additional channel appears in the Channels palette, as shown in the preceding
figure. This new channel is the alpha channel — your saved selection.
8. Click the Create a New Layer icon (dog eared page) in the Layers palette. Double-
click the layer name and rename it.
I named mine large highlight.
Putting your highlights and shadows on separate layers is important so that you can
apply different opacity settings and also retain the ability to tweak them later if
needed.
9. Choose Edit➪Fill, choose the White option for Contents, and leave all the other
options at their default settings. Click OK.
The dialog box closes.
Your highlight is now filled with white. Don’t worry; it won’t stay this opaque.

10. In the Layers palette, adjust the Opacity setting to
50%.
The highlight now appears translucent (refer to the
preceding figure).
11. Choose the Pen tool and create a path for the high-
light on the bottom of the object, as seen in the
figure.
Make sure the path matches up to the edge of the
object. Use the Direct Selection tool if you need to
adjust the anchor points or curve segments of the path.
12. In the Paths palette, click the third icon from the left at the bottom of the palette.
The work path disappears, and a selection marquee appears.
13. Choose Select➪Save Selection. In the Save Selection dialog box, name the chan-
nel. Make sure the channel is new and click OK.
Mine is called “bottom highlight.” Another alpha channel appears in the Channels
palette.
14. Repeat Steps 8, 9, and 10, but only adjust the opacity to 30%.
15. Use the Pen tool to create a path for the smaller shadow.
For example, I created a path on the bottom right of the ball.
16. Load the path as a selection in the Paths palette and choose Select➪Feather. Enter
3 pixels and click OK.
The idea is to give the shadow a softer edge.
17. Repeat Steps 6 through 10, but fill the selection
with black instead of white and adjust the opacity
to 20%.
The shadow is shown in the figure.
18. Use a selection tool to add a cast shadow.
In my example, I used the Ellipse tool, pressed Alt
(Option on the Mac), and created an ellipse at the
base of the ball, shown in the figure.
Then I feathered the selection 25 pixels before I
saved the selection.
The cast shadow needs to have really fuzzy edges, thus the large number of pixels
for the feather.
continued

Using the Channel Mixer
476
19. Repeat Steps 8 and 9, filling the selection with
black.
My highlighted and shadowed pool ball is ready to
roll, shown in the figure.
If your cast shadow layer is above your object, you
have to change the stacking order and move your
shadow layer so that it’s below your object.
Now that you’ve spent all this time on the front end
creating your alpha channels, you can then save time on the back end by using
those alpha channels to apply highlights and shadows to similar artwork.
20. To load alpha channels, choose Select➪Load Selection and select your alpha
channels from the Channel pop-up menu. Then repeat these steps.
In my example, I took the highlights and shadows I created with lucky pool ball
number 7 and loaded them as alpha channels in pool ball number 5.

asking is essentially just another way of making a selection. Instead
of defining your selection with a selection outline, masks define your
selection with up to 256 levels of gray, which allows you to have varying
levels of selection. Photoshop masks or protects unselected pixels from any
commands you execute. Photoshop doesn’t mask selected
pixels, making them fair game to any executed commands.
Different types of masks have different purposes —
channel masks, layer masks, and vector masks. You
can use them to temporarily make a selection, save
and load selections, define vector shapes, selec-
tively apply an adjustment layer or filter, blend
one layer into another, and so on. Although select-
ing with the Marquee, Lasso, Magic Wand, and Pen
tools can be fine, you’ll soon find that these tools
have a limited repertoire: You can’t use them with
much accuracy on more complex images. That’s
when you turn to masking. 
Most things that pack a powerful punch are either expen-
sive or hard to master, or both. Well, you already forked out a
pretty penny for Photoshop. And yes, masking isn’t for those who get
their selections via a drive-thru window. To help you with the learning
curve, in this chapter, I ease you into masking by using Photoshop’s auto-
mated masking tools. Although they aren’t quite as accurate as the hard-
core masking I cover in Book VI, Chapter 3, they are easier on you, and with
certain images (or a serious time crunch), the quick-and-dirty masking tools
get the job done.

Working with Quick Masks
478
Working with Quick Masks
As you can probably guess from the name, Quick Masks allow you to create
and edit selections quickly without having to bother with the Channels
palette. Although you don’t really create an end-product mask per se, the way
you go about getting your selection is “mask-like.” They are also user friendly
in that they allow you to see your image while you’re working. You can begin
your Quick Mask by using a selection tool or a painting tool. After you have
your Quick Mask, you can edit the mask using any painting or editing tool.
Quick Masks are temporary, so if you create one you really like, be sure and
choose Select➪Save Selection at the end of the following steps. (Note that
you have to be out of Quick Mask mode to do this.) That way you can save
the selection as an alpha channel. For more on saving selections as alpha
channels, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
Follow these steps to create your very own Quick Mask:
1. Open a new document and, using
any selection tool, select the ele-
ment you want in your image.
Don’t worry about getting the
selection perfect. You can fine-
tune your selection after you have
the Quick Mask in place. Note that
you can also just paint your mask
from scratch. But I think that start-
ing with a selection is easier.
Click the Edit in Quick Mask Mode
button (or press the Q key) in the
Tools palette.
Note that there are no longer two
buttons for Quick Mode and
Standard Mode. The button now
acts as a toggle between the two
modes.
A color overlay covers and pro-
tects the area outside the selec-
tion, as shown in Figure 2-1. The
selected pixels are unprotected.
2. Refine the mask by selecting a
painting or editing tool.
Paint with black to add to the mask, thereby making the selection
smaller. Even though you are painting with black, your strokes will

show up as a red overlay. This red overlay is a
visual carryover from back in the day when
artists used rubylith (red transparent mate-
rial) to mask portions of their art during air-
brushing. Paint with white to delete from the
mask, making the selection larger. Paint with a
shade of gray to partially select the pixels.
Partially selected pixels take on a semitrans-
parent look, perfect for feathered edges, as
you can see in Figure 2-2.
3. After you finish editing your mask, shown in
Figure 2-3, click the Edit in Standard Mode
button in the Tools palette to exit the Quick Mask.
The overlay disappears and a selection outline appears. Your selection
is ready and waiting for your next command. The selection outline cor-
relates with the unmasked or selected areas of the Quick Mask. Don’t be
surprised if the wispy or soft edges you so diligently selected aren’t
readily apparent when you switch back to normal editing mode. When
you composite your selected image with another, your hard quick mask-
ing work will be evident.

Using the Color Range Command
480
Using the Color Range Command
The Color Range command allows you to select similarly colored pixels in a
selection or within an entire image. You can think of it as a smarter Magic
Wand tool. Unlike the Magic Wand tool, however, Color Range lets you
adjust your selection before you ultimately get the selection outline. It does
this by using Fuzziness (a cousin of Tolerance), which allows you to select
colors relative to how closely they resemble the sampled colors. Photoshop
selects all the identical colors, partially selects similar colors, and does not
select dissimilar colors. You adjust the fuzziness, and Photoshop adjusts
the selection.
Color Range basics
Here are some Color Range command tips before you get started:
 You can save and load Color Range settings by clicking the appropriate
buttons in the dialog box. But heck, after you have a selection, you can
also choose Select➪Save Selection to save it as an alpha channel. 
 You can select a color range based on preset colors or tones that you
choose from the Select drop-down list. For example, choosing red auto-
matically selects all the red in the image. Choosing midtones selects all
the medium-range tones in the image. And Out-of-Gamut (only available
for RGB and Lab modes) selects all colors that cannot be printed using
CMYK colors. For more on modes, see Book II, Chapter 2.
If you choose the Color Range command when you have an active selec-
tion, Photoshop selects only colors within the selection outline and
ignores the rest of your image.
Changing Quick Mask options
You can change Quick Mask options by double-
clicking the Quick Mask Mode button in the
Tools palette.
When you add a Quick Mask to a selection, by
default a red overlay covers the selected area.
The overlay has an opacity setting of 50%.
In addition to changing the color (to provide
better contrast with your image, perhaps) and
opacity of the overlay, you can also choose
whether you want the overlay to represent the
masked (unselected, protected) areas or the
selected (unprotected) areas.

Using the Color Range Command
481
Executing the Color Range command
Here’s all you need to know about working with the Color Range command:
1. Choose Select➪Color Range.
The Color Range dialog box appears in full glory.
2. Choose Sampled Colors from the Select drop-down list and then
choose the Eyedropper tool in the dialog box.
3. Select a display option — Selection or Image.
I recommend leaving the setting at the default of Selection so that you
can see the mask as you build it. You can toggle between the two views
by pressing Ctrl (Ô on the Mac).
4. Either in the image itself or in the image preview in the Color Range
dialog box, click to sample your desired colors.
The image preview changes to a mask. Black areas show unselected
pixels, white areas show selected pixels, and gray areas show partially
selected pixels.
Your goal is to try to make what
you want all white and what you
don’t want all black, as shown in
Figure 2-4. And if you want some
things partially selected, they can
remain gray.
5. Adjust the selection by adding or
deleting colors. 
You can select or delete as many
colors in your image as you want.
Use the Add to Sample tool (plus
eyedropper icon) to add, and use
the Subtract from Sample tool
(minus eyedropper icon) to delete.
You can be lazy like me and just
stick with the regular eyedropper
icon. Simply use Shift and Alt (Shift
and Option on the Mac) to add and
delete.
6. Fine-tune the range of colors by dragging the Fuzziness slider.
The Fuzziness ranges extend from 0 to 200. A higher value selects more
colors, and a lower value selects fewer colors. As you adjust the fuzzi-
ness, the mask dynamically updates.

The Invert option selects what is currently unselected and deselects

7. Choose a Selection Preview from the drop-down list to preview the
selection in the image window.
• None displays the image normally (refer to Figure 2-4).
• Grayscale displays just the grayscale mask.
• Black Matte and White Matte display the selection against a black

Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools
The eraser tools let you erase portions of an image to the background color,
to transparency, or even to the way your image looked earlier in your edit-
ing session. There are three eraser tools — the regular Eraser, the Magic
Eraser, and the Background Eraser. All three share a tool flyout menu.
The eraser tools look like real erasers so you can’t miss them. But just in
case you do, press E and then Shift+E to toggle through the three tools.
When you erase pixels, those pixels are gone. Gone. For good. Before using
the eraser tools or the Extract command (coming up in the next section), it
might be wise to make a backup of your image. You can save the image
either as a separate file or as another layer. That way, if things run amuck,
you have some insurance.
The Eraser tool
The Eraser tool allows you to erase areas on your image to either the back-
ground color or to transparency. Select it, drag through the desired area on
your image, and you’re done.
If the image isn’t layered and has just a background, you erase to the back-
ground color, as shown in Figure 2-6. If the image is on a layer, you erase to
transparency.

Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools

I rate this tool in the same category as the Lasso tool. It’s quick, it’s easy,
but it has limited applications. Use it only for minor touchups. The Eraser
tool definitely isn’t a tool to use on its own for making accurate selections.
The most useful function I find for the Eraser tool is to clean up my channel
masks. Set the mode to Block, zoom into your mask, and clean up those
black and white pixels. See Book VI, Chapter 3 for more on channel masks.
These options on the Options bar control the Eraser tool:
 Mode: Select from Brush, Pencil, and Block. When you select Brush or
Pencil you have access to the Brush Preset picker palette on the far left
of the Options bar.
Use the Brush Preset picker drop-down palette to select from a variety
of brush sizes and styles. Block has only one size, a square of 16 x 16
pixels. But because the block size remains constant, if you zoom way in,
you can perform some detailed erasing.
 Opacity: Specify a percentage of transparency for the erasure. Opacity
settings less than 100 percent only partially erase the pixels. The lower
the Opacity setting, the less it erases. This option isn’t available for the
Block mode.
 Flow: Set a flow rate percentage when using Brush mode. Flow specifies
how fast Photoshop applies the erasure and is especially handy when
using the Airbrush option.
 Airbrush: Click the button when using Brush mode to turn your brush
into an airbrush. With this option, the longer you hold your mouse
button down, the more it erases. 
 Erase to History: This option allows you to erase back to a selected
source state or snapshot in the History palette. You can also press Alt
(Option on the Mac) to temporarily access the Erase to History option.
See Book II, Chapter 4 for more information. 
 Brush Palette: Click the toggle button to bring up the full Brushes
palette.
The Magic Eraser tool
The Magic Eraser tool works like a combination Eraser and Magic Wand
tool. It both selects and erases similarly colored pixels:
 When you click a layer: The Magic Eraser tool erases pixels of a similar
color based on a specified range and leaves the area transparent, as
shown in Figure 2-7.

Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools
485
 When you click an image that has just a background: The Magic
Eraser tool automatically converts the background to a layer and then
does the same thing. 
 When you click a layer with locked transparency: The Magic Eraser
tool erases the pixels and replaces the area with the background color.
The Tolerance value defines the range
of colors that Photoshop erases, just
like it does with the Magic Wand tool.
The value determines how similar a
neighboring color has to be to the color
that you click. A higher value picks up
more colors, whereas a lower value
picks up fewer colors. In my example in
Figure 2-7, I set my Tolerance value to 
8 and clicked in the upper left of my
image. Photoshop selected and erased
only a limited shade of black due to my
lower Tolerance setting.
Here are the other options:
 Anti-alias: Creates a slightly soft
edge around the transparent area.
 Contiguous: Selects only similar
colors that are adjacent to each
other. Deselect this option to
delete similar-colored pixels wherever they appear in your image. 
 Sample All Layers: Samples colors using data from all visible layers, but
erases pixels on the active layer only.
 Opacity: Works like it does for the regular Eraser tool.
The Background Eraser tool
The Background Eraser tool is probably the most sophisticated of the
eraser-tool lot. It erases away the background from an image and leaves the
foreground untouched, in theory anyway.
If you’re not careful, the Background Eraser tool erases the foreground and
anything else in its path.
Like the Magic Eraser tool, the Background Eraser tool erases to trans-
parency on a layer. If you drag an image with only a background, Photoshop
converts the background into a layer.

Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools

To use the Background Eraser tool,
you need to carefully keep the
crosshair in the center of the cursor,
also known as the hot spot, on the
background pixels as you drag. Then
Photoshop deletes all background
pixels under the brush circumference.
But, if you touch a foreground pixel
with the hot spot, it’s gobbled up as
well. As you can see from my example
in Figure 2-8, I got a little too close to
the man’s face in some spots, and it
left him a little chewed up.
Here’s the rundown on the options,
found on the Options bar, for the
Background Eraser:
 Brush Preset picker: Provides var-
ious settings to customize the size
and appearance of your eraser tip.
The size and tolerance settings at
the bottom are for those using
pressure-sensitive drawing tablets.
You can base the size and tolerance on the pen pressure or position of
the thumbwheel.
 Sampling: The three settings determine what areas should and shouldn’t
be erased. The default Sampling: Continuous setting allows you to sample
colors continuously as you drag through the image. The Sampling: Once
setting erases only areas that contain the color that you first clicked. If
the background is pretty much one color, you can try this option. The
Sampling: Background Swatch setting erases only the areas containing
the background color.
 Limits: The Contiguous setting erases similar colors that are adjacent 
to one another. The Discontiguous setting erases all similarly colored
pixels wherever they appear in the image. The Find Edges setting erases
contiguous pixels while retaining the sharpness of the edges.
 Tolerance: Works just like the Magic Eraser Tolerance setting.
 Protect Foreground Color: Prevents the erasing of areas that match the
foreground color. 
Background Eraser chews up man’s face.

Extracting an Image

Extracting an Image
The last of the automated masking tools in Photoshop is the Extract com-
mand. The name sounds great. You expect that it plucks your desired ele-
ment right out of the image, cleanly, neatly, and without pain. But to be
honest with you, I find the Extract command to be overly complex for the
results it provides. You can get lucky and select an image that works well
with the command. But frequently, it does a marginal job. When you learn
the art of true, manual masking, you may never visit the Extract command
again.
Here’s how the Extract command works:
1. Choose Filter➪Extract. 
Photoshop brings up the Extract dialog box, shown in Figure 2-9.

Figure 2-9: When using the Extract command’s Edge Highlighter, be 
sure and overlap the edge of your desired element and the edge 
of the background.

Chapter 2
Quick and Dirty
Masking

Extracting an Image
488
2. Select the Edge Highlighter tool, located at the top of the dialog box’s
Tools palette.
You can also press the B key to access the tool.
Photoshop offers a Smart Highlighting option, in the Tool Options area
on the right side of the dialog box. 
If your image has a well-defined edge, but the foreground and back-
ground colors are similar or the image is highly textured, the Smart
Highlighting option helps the Edge Highlighter tool to cling to the edge
as you use the tool. You can toggle the option on and off by pressing
Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) when using the Edge Highlighter tool.
3. Trace around the edges of the element you want to select. As you trace,
feel free to change the brush size, again in the Tool Options area.
Use a small brush for well-defined, sharp edges. Use a larger brush for
wispier detailed edges such as hair, fur, leaves, and the like. To change
the brush size using keyboard shortcuts, click the left (for smaller) and
right (for larger) bracket keys ([ and ]). Hold down the bracket key, and
the brush size changes more dramatically.
Be sure that the highlighted edge overlaps both the element and the
background.
You can change the colors of the highlight and fill in the Tool Options
settings as well. 
I traced around the man in Figure 2-9. Make a complete path around the
element. If one or more sides of your element is cropped off the edge,
you don’t have to highlight that side:
• Use the Hand tool to move your image if needed. You can temporar-
ily access the Hand tool by pressing the spacebar. 
• Use the Zoom tool to zoom in. Press Alt (Option on the Mac) to zoom
out. You can also Zoom by pressing Ctrl++ and Ctrl+- (Ô++ and Ô+- on
the Mac).
• The Channel option allows you to load an alpha channel as a start-
ing point for the extraction. You can then modify the highlighted
area using the Edge Highlighter and Eraser tools. 
Beware. For some reason when loading the alpha channel into the
Extract dialog box, Photoshop converts the black areas in the mask into
the highlighted area but doesn’t highlight the white areas. This is the
opposite of what you would expect, but it works out just the same. After
you complete the highlighted area, fill the unlighted area with the Fill
tool (see Step 7).
4. If you make a mistake as you create your highlighted outline, press
Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to undo your error.

Extracting an Image
489
5. When you have made your outline, use the Eraser tool to clean up
any hiccups in the outline.
Press the E key to select the Eraser tool from the keyboard. You can have
the best of both tools and toggle between the Edge Highlighter and the
Eraser tools by pressing Alt (Option on the Mac).
6. To erase an entire highlight, press Alt+Backspace (Option+Delete on
the Mac).
7. Select the Fill tool, the second tool in the Tools palette (or press the G
key) and click inside the highlighted outline.
The outline fills with color (refer to Figure 2-9). 
If by chance the color leaks outside the highlighted edge, you may have
a small hole somewhere along the outline. Locate the offending hole and
patch it with the Edge Highlighter tool. Click inside the highlighted out-
line again with the Fill tool. To unfill an area, click inside the same area
with the Fill tool.
As an alternative to using the Fill
tool, you can select the Force Fore-
ground option. This option can be
useful if the element you want to
select is mostly tones of one color.
Use the Eyedropper tool to sample
the color in the area you want to
select. Then use the Edge High-
lighter tool to highlight those areas
containing your desired color. 
8. Click the Preview button and
take a gander at your extracted
element (or click OK to skip the
preview and get your extraction).
If your background is solid and
uncluttered, your foreground ele-
ment has a simple, uncomplicated
edge, you can see quite a bit of
contrast between the foreground
and background elements, and if
the planets are aligned just so,
your results are likely to be pretty
good. My example has only a
minor bit of background fringe
around the moustache and the 
top of the turban, as shown in
Figure 2-10.

9. If you need to clean up a bit of fringe, give the Smooth option a shot.
This option removes stray pixels or artifacts from the selection. A high
value smoothes out the edges around the selection, but can cause some
undesirable blurring as well. Start with 0 or a small value first, before
increasing the Smooth amount.
10. If you’re happy with the results, click OK.
Photoshop deletes the masked areas. If your image was a background,
Photoshop converts it to a layer, so the selected element will be against
transparency.
11. If you would rather preview your image against something other than
the transparent checkerboard, choose another option from the
Display drop-down list.
You can view the image against a white, gray, black, or other colored
background. Or you can view it as a mask. (If you view it as a mask, the
white areas represent the selected areas and the black areas represent
the transparent areas.)
12. If you’re not happy, choose a view option before you start editing
your mask.
You can choose between the Original and Extracted view from the Show
drop-down list. 
You can also select the Show Highlight and Show Fill check boxes. 
13. To do fine-tuned editing of your image, you have the following tools
at your disposal:
• Drag with the Cleanup tool (press C on the keyboard) to erase 
background pixels around your extraction by subtracting opacity.
Alt+drag (Option+drag on the Mac) to bring the opacity back. This
tool is useful for creating feathered edges. 
• The Edge Touchup tool (T is the keyboard shortcut) sharpens the
edges of the selection by adding opacity to your selection or sub-
tracting opacity from the background. 
You can adjust the brush size of these editing tools to get the best
results. 
14. When you finish editing, click OK to exit the dialog box. If you still
have some areas that need some cleanup, use some regular editing
tools, such as the Background Eraser and the History Brush tools. 

Putting It Together
Framing a Photo with Quick Mask
Sometimes you may want to add a decorative border or edge to your image. Maybe
you’re creating a postcard or greeting card and the standard rectangular shape image
just doesn’t provide enough pizzazz. Although adding a border or edge might look diffi-
cult, it is a snap with the Quick Mask command.
1. Using any selection tool, create a selection on your image.
I started with a rectangle in my image and then chose Select➪Inverse to turn the
selection inside out.
2. Click the Edit in Quick Mask Mode
button in the Tools palette.
A color overlay covers and protects
the area outside the selection, as
shown in the figure.
Your selected area is open for you to
edit as you so desire. 
3. Grab the Brush tool, choose the Heavy
Stipple brush, and set the brush diam-
eter to 168 pixels.
You can find the Heavy Stipple brush in the Wet Media Brushes library of the
Brushes palette.
4. Paint around the edges of the mask with black to add to the masked area.
5. Adjust the Flow setting to 35% to get a semitransparent area, and then click a few
more times. 
You could also paint with gray to get the same effect.
6. Again, adjust your brush diameter, this time to 80 pixels, and add a few random
clicks here and there.
7. Switch your color to white and repeat
the steps, clicking around the image
and also in the interior of the mask.
Because white adds to the selected
area, your image starts to show
through.
I ended up with a mottled mess, shown
in the figure.

You can also apply a filter or adjustment (Image➪Adjustment) to the Quick Mask.
See this technique in action in Book VII, Chapter 2.
8. Click the Edit in Standard Mode button
to exit the Quick Mask mode.
The overlay disappears, leaving you 
with a selection outline, shown in the 
figure.
The selection outline correlates with 
the unmasked or selected areas of the 
Quick Mask. If you had a feathered 
mask, such as mine, the selection out
line runs halfway between the selected 
and unselected areas of the mask, creating a soft transition. 
9. Your selection is ready and waiting for your next command.
In my example, I deleted my selection, thereby filling the hole with my background
color of white and leaving me with a stippled image. Note that because my brush
was feathered and also varied in the Flow settings, some of my image is also feath-
ered and semitransparent.

 Creating and editing channel masks
I
f you haven’t already checked out Book VI, Chapter 2, which covers
Photoshop’s quick and easy masking tools, you might want to breeze
through that chapter first, especially if the word mask brings to mind an
image from Halloween instead of a selection technique. In this chapter, I
dive into some manual masking techniques.
Layer masks are tremendously useful, and if you’re like me,
you’ll find yourself addicted to them. They can be fantastic
for blending layers and making multiple images dissolve
into one another. Vector masks create shapes defined
by vector paths and produce clean, smooth-edged
graphic elements.
Channel masks are probably the most time-
consuming of the masking lot, but they’re powerful
and accurate. Like anything in life, the more you
practice using them, the faster and better you get.
After you get through this final chapter of Book VI,
you’ll be familiar with every masking technique
Photoshop has to offer. By then, you’ll be prepared to use
masks to select a very hairy orangutan, dyed green, perched
in a tree in a lush rainforest. And how many people can say that?
Working with Layer Masks
Like any other mask, a layer mask is a grayscale image that you can edit to
your heart’s content. Layer masks are excellent for blending layers of
images together and creating soft transitions between elements.

Working with Layer Masks
494
For versatility, layer masks are unparalleled. They allow you to gradually
brush in transparency and opacity on a selective pixel basis. Paint with
black to hide portions of the layer; paint with white to display portions; and
paint in varying shades of gray to partially show elements. You can even
apply gradients, image adjustments, and filters to your layer masks to
create interesting special effects.
After you get the concept of layer masks, you’ll never use the eraser tools
(covered in Book VI, Chapter 2) again. You won’t have to because one of the
great things about layer masks is that you can forever edit, or even delete
them, with no permanent harm whatsoever to the image.
Creating layer masks
To create a layer mask, select your desired layer and choose Layer➪
Layer Mask➪Reveal All or Hide All.
 Reveal All creates a mask filled with white, which shows the layer.
 Hide All creates a mask filled with black, which hides, or masks, the
layer and shows nothing but transparency.
You can also click the Add Layer Mask icon at the bottom of Layers palette
(which by default selects Reveal All).
You can’t add a layer mask to a background layer. You must convert the
background layer to a regular layer if you want to use a layer mask on the
background of an image.
You can also apply a layer mask. Choose your desired layer and make a
selection using one of the selection tools. Choose Layer➪Layer Mask➪
Reveal Selection or Hide Selection. You can also click the Add Layer Mask
button in the Layers palette to create a mask that reveals the selection.
After you create the layer mask, you can grab the painting tool of your
choice and apply your grayscale color. Remember: Add white to the mask
to display the image. Add black to hide the image. Add gray to make the
image semitransparent.
Using the Gradient and Brush tools on a layer mask
I must confess: I use two of the layer masking tools more than the others:
 The Gradient tool, set to a linear gradient of black to white or white to
black is truly awesome. Simply drag the layer mask to create the gradi-
ent. The darker areas of the gradient gradually hide the image, whereas
the lighter areas gradually show the image.

Working with Layer Masks
495
 The Brush tool, with a large, feathered tip, using the Airbrush option
and the Flow set to around 10% is amazing. With these settings in place,
you can create feathered edges that blend one layer into another with-
out any harsh lines.
In Figure 3-1, which is an image with two layers (the flag on the bottom and
the girl on top), I used a combination of both these tools. I started with the
black-to-white linear gradient, which I dragged from the left edge of my
image through to the right edge. I then took the Brush tool with a large
feathered tip (265 pixels), selected the Airbrush option, set the Flow to 10%,
and worked my way around the profile of the girl’s face to get rid of some
more of the background behind her.

To edit a layer mask, click the Layer Mask thumbnail in the Layers palette.
Select your desired painting or editing tool, and paint or edit the mask to per-
fection. Just be sure that you’re working on the layer mask, instead of editing
the image itself. Otherwise, you apply paint directly to your image. You can tell
because you see a layer mask icon next to the eye icon in the Layers palette.
Managing layer masks
Here are some tips to help you work with your layer masks. You can do the
following:
 Load a layer mask: Loading a layer mask means getting a selection out-
line based on the layer mask. Simply Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) the
Layer Mask thumbnail.
 View the mask without viewing
the image: Sometimes when you’re
editing a layer mask, you may find
it helpful to see the mask itself
without having to view the image,
too. For example, in Figure 3-2, I
hid the image of the little girl and
the flag to see the layer masks.
Simply Alt+click (Option+click on
the Mac) the Layer Mask thumb-
nail to view the mask and hide the
image on the layer.
To redisplay the image, Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) again or
click the eye icon in the far left column.
 View the layer mask as a red overlay: If you prefer to see your layer
mask as a red overlay (called a rubylith), Alt+Shift+click (Option+Shift+
click on the Mac) the Layer Mask thumbnail. You can also click the eye-
ball icon on the layer mask in the Channels palette.
 Click again with the same keys to remove the overlay: You can change
the opacity and color of the overlay in the Layer Mask Display Options
dialog box, which you access by double-clicking the layer mask channel
in the Channels palette.
A rubylith is similar to the red overlay used with Quick Masks, covered
in Book VI, Chapter 2.
 Paste a copied selection into a layer mask: Simply Alt+click (Option+
click on the Mac) the Layer Mask thumbnail. Choose Edit➪Paste and
then Select➪Deselect. Click the image thumbnail in the Layers palette to
return to the image.
The copied selection can consist of anything, but this technique comes
in particularly handy when you’re copying one layer mask into another.
 Disable (temporarily hide) or enable a layer mask: Just Shift+click the
Layer Mask thumbnail or choose Layer➪Layer Mask➪Disable or Enable.
Figure 3-2: Check out just your layer
mask without the image.

Working with Layer Masks

 Unlink a layer from its layer mask: By default, Photoshop links a layer
mask to the contents of the layer. This allows them to move together. To
unlink a layer from its layer mask, click the link icon in the Layers palette.
Click again to re-establish the link. You can also choose Layer➪Layer
Mask➪Unlink or Link.
 Discard a layer mask: Just drag the Layer Mask thumbnail to the trash
can icon in the Layers palette. Click Discard in the dialog box. Or you
can choose Layer➪Layer Mask➪Delete. 
 Apply a layer mask: When you apply a layer mask, you fuse the mask to
the image. Photoshop replaces all black areas in the mask with transpar-
ent pixels and all gray areas with partially transparent pixels; all white
areas are image pixels. Drag the thumbnail to the trash can icon in the
Layers palette. Click Apply in the dialog box. Or you can choose Layer➪
Layer Mask➪Apply.

Making a Photo Gradually Fade from Color to Grayscale
Layer masks are extremely powerful when it comes to blending multiple images so that
one seems to dissolve into the others. This time I’m not going to show you how to use a
layer mask to blend different images, but rather the same image — one in color and one
in grayscale.
1. Open a copy of your favorite color image, shown in
the figure.
The subject matter isn’t critical here, so feel free to
whip out that old prom picture.
2. Choose Image➪Duplicate.
Accept the default name and click OK in the dialog
box.
3. With the duplicate image active, choose
Window➪Channels.
4. View each of the channels to find the one that gives
you the best grayscale image. Choose your desired
channel.
If you need a refresher on channels, see Book VI,
Chapter 1. The Red channel gives the best contrast for the portrait in my example.
Because skin tones tend to have a lot of red in them, the Red channel usually provides
the best grayscale image of a person.
continued

Working with Layer Masks

5. Choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale and click OK in
the Discard Other Channels alert box.
Photoshop has now stripped the color from the
image, shown in the figure.
This is only one way to convert a color image to
grayscale. There are lots of others. Check them out
in Book II, Chapter 2.
6. Choose Window➪Layers. With the Move tool and
holding down the Shift key, drag and drop your
grayscale image onto your color image.
This action automatically creates a new layer from
the grayscale image. (See Book V for more informa-
tion about layers.)
By holding down the Shift key, you will keep the grayscale image centered over the
color image.
7. Close your duplicate image.
8. Press D for default colors.
This gives you a black foreground swatch and a white background swatch in your
Tools palette.
Now, I show you how to use one of my favorite techniques, a black-to-white gradi-
ent, on the layer mask.
9. Make sure that the grayscale layer you dragged in is the active layer in the Layers
palette. Click the Add Layer Mask icon at the bottom of the palette.
It’s the icon that looks like a dark square with a white circle on top. Photoshop adds
a second thumbnail on your layer, indicating that a layer mask has been applied.
A layer mask acts like a piece of clear acetate over your layer.
10. Select the Gradient tool. Then select the default gradient of Foreground to
Background.
To get the default gradient, click the Gradient picker on the Options bar and select
the first gradient. 
It should be a gradient of white to black because it’s based on the current fore-
ground and background colors, which reverse when you select the Layer Mask
thumbnail. For a gradient refresher, see Book IV, Chapter 3.
11. Drag the gradient from the top of your image to the bottom.
Or from left to right. Or at a diagonal. It’s your call.
12. Experiment with long drags and short drags. The angle and length of your mouse
movement determine how the layer mask reveals the underlying image.

In my example, I dragged from the bottom of the image to the top and stopped about
two-thirds of the way up.
Where black appears on the layer mask, the grayscale image is hidden. Where
white appears on the mask, the grayscale image shows through and everything in
between allows the grayscale image to partially show.
Although I used a linear gradient in my example, you can experiment with the other
types as well. Radial gradients can provide some interesting effects.
13. When you complete your mask, save and close the file.
Creating and Editing Vector Masks
Whereas layer masks let you create soft-edged masks, vector masks create
hard-edged masks defined by shapes created by a vector path on a layer.
Vector-based shapes produce clean, smooth, and well-defined edges that are
never jagged. And you can size and transform vector shapes without ever
degrading the appearance of the element. (For an introduction to vector
images, see Book IV, Chapter 1.)

Creating and Editing Vector Masks
500
You create a vector mask when you create a shape with any one of the
shape tools. You can also create a vector mask when you convert type to
a shape (Layer➪Type➪Convert to Shape). See Book IV, Chapter 3.
Adding a vector mask to a layer
To add a vector mask to layer, follow these steps:
1. Select the layer in the Layers palette and choose Layer➪Vector Mask➪
Reveal All or Hide All.
I describe Reveal All and Hide All in the “Creating layer masks” section.
Remember that you cannot add a vector mask to a background layer.
2. On the vector mask, create a path with the Pen tool or grab any
shape tool and create a shape.
See Book III, Chapter 2 for more on paths and Book IV, Chapter 1 for
more on shapes.
I selected the Custom Shape tool and dragged a sunburst shape on my
vector mask. Notice how everything outside the path is hidden, or
masked, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Like layer masks, you can add vector masks only to layers, not back-
grounds. If necessary, simply convert your background to a layer by
double-clicking background in the Layers palette.
3. If your vector mask is satisfactory, save your file and then close it.
Figure 3-3: Everything outside of a vector mask is hidden, or masked, from display.

Another way to add a vector mask is to select your desired layer, draw a
work path with the Pen tool or one of the shape tools, and then select
Layer➪Vector Mask➪Current Path.
Managing vector masks
Here are a few more vector mask tips. You can perform the following tasks:
 Edit a vector mask path: Use the pen tools and the Direct Selection tool,
as described in Book III, Chapter 2.
 Add multiple shapes or paths to the existing vector mask: All you need
to do is just drag another shape with any of the shape tools. Or add
another path with the Pen tool.
 Remove a vector mask from a layer: Drag the thumbnail to the trash
can icon in the Layers palette or choose Layer➪Vector Mask➪Delete.
 Disable (temporarily hide) or enable a vector mask: Shift+click the
vector mask thumbnail or choose
Layer➪Vector Mask➪Disable (or
Enable).
 Rasterize a vector mask: Rasterizing
(or turning the mask into a pixel-
based image) converts the vector
mask into a layer mask. Choose
Layer➪Rasterize➪Vector Mask.

shapes: This is a quick and easy
way to create buttons for a Web

Figure 3-4. Just select the layer, not
the vector mask, and choose
Layer➪Layer Style. Select your
style of choice. For details on layer
styles, see Book V, Chapter 4.
Creating Channel Masks
Photoshop’s channel masks are probably the most time-consuming masks to
use because they require a lot of manual labor. Not heavy lifting, mind you,
but work with the tools and commands in Photoshop.

But, don’t get me wrong, it’s time well spent. Channel masks can usually
accurately select what the other Photoshop tools can only dream about —
wisps of hair, tufts of fur, a ficus benjamina tree with 9,574 leaves.
You can create a channel mask in lots of ways, but I’m here to offer you one
that works most of the time. To create a channel mask, follow these steps:
1. Analyze your existing channels to find a suitable candidate to use to
create a duplicate channel.
This is usually the channel with the most contrast between what you
want and don’t want. For instance, in my example, the Red channel 
provided the most contrast between the tree and lanterns, which I
wanted to mask, and the background, which I didn’t.
After you duplicate the channel, it then becomes an alpha channel. 
2. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels.
Using the histogram and the sliders in the Levels dialog box, increase
the contrast between the element(s) you want and don’t want selected.
3. Choose a tool, such as the Brush or Eraser tool, and paint and edit
the alpha channel to refine the mask.
See Figure 3-5. I used the a combo of the brush and Eraser set to Block
mode to clean up my mask.

tools to refine your channel mask.

4. When you complete the mask, click the Load Channel as Selection
icon (the dotted circle icon on the far left) at the bottom of the
Channels palette. Then click your composite channel at the top of the
list of channels.
This loads your mask as a selection, giving you that familiar selection
outline. You can also use one of my favorite keyboard shortcuts:
Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) directly on the alpha channel to load
the mask as a selection.
Your selection is now ready to go.
5. You can leave it within the original image or drag and drop it onto
another image, as I did in Figure 3-6.
Because my new sky was darker than my original, I also darkened my
windmills so the lighting would be more consistent. If you’ve done a good
job, nobody will be the wiser that the two images never met in real life.

Putting It Together
Masking Hair, Fur, and Other Wispy Things
Hair, fur, fuzz, and other objects with complex or loosely defined edges can prove difficult
to select with the run-of-the-mill selection techniques. But that’s where masking can
save the day. Because a mask allows for a 256-level selection, it does a great job in pick-
ing up those illusive strands of hair and such that would otherwise probably be cut off in
the selecting process.
Perhaps you’ve seen those photos where everyone in a composite image appears to
have helmet hair? Here are the steps to avoid the Aqua Net look and select even the
smallest wisp of hair:
1. Choose File➪Open.
Select an image that contains some-
thing hairy, furry, or fuzzy. A portrait is
an ideal choice (unless the subject is
hair challenged).
For your first attempt at this technique,
starting with an image that has a
pretty simple and uncluttered back-
ground is best. 
In my example, I used an image of a
pensive, young urban professional
shown in the figure.
2. Choose Window➪Channels.
View each channel by clicking the
channel name.
Each channel is an independent grayscale image and a potential starting point for
a mask.
It is best to start with the channel that contains the most contrast between what
you want to select and what you don’t. If it’s a toss-up, go with the channel that
makes selecting the difficult part of the image easiest (in my example, that’s
the hair).
In my example, I’m using the Blue channel.
3. Choose Duplicate Channel from the Channels palette pop-up menu. Name the
channel mask and click OK.

continued
You’ve created an alpha channel for
the mask, shown in the figure. Now
you can edit the mask without harming
the original channel.
4. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels
and boost the contrast in the image by
adjusting the Input sliders for shad-
ows, midtones, and highlights.
If you need help using the Levels
adjustment, see Book VIII, Chapter 1.
5. Select the person and his or her hair.
You can do that one of two ways:
 By selecting the person.
 By selecting the background first and then inverting the selection.
In a mask, traditionally white represents a selected area, black represents an unse-
lected area, and gray represents a partially selected area. 
6. Adjust the Levels settings by dragging your shadows, midtones, and highlights
sliders so that the element you want to select is either all white or all black with a
little gray in the wispy areas. In other words, you want to change most of the
pixels in the image to either black or white.
In my example, because my guy is darker than the background, I adjusted the con-
trast to make the subject as black as I could while making the background lighter.
You can see the result in the figure.

Creating Channel Masks
506
7. If you think the edges of your image need to be accentuated, you can apply a High
Pass filter (Filter➪Other➪High Pass) before you apply the Level adjustment.
High Pass turns your overall image gray while leaving the edges white.
Don’t use too low a radius value (start with a setting between 8 and 10) or complet-
ing the mask can be too time-consuming.
8. Refine the mask by selecting the Eraser tool and choosing Block Mode from the
Options bar.
The Block Eraser is a great tool for cleaning up masks. It allows you to paint inside
the mask without creating any feathered edges.
9. Press D for default colors.
Remember the Eraser tool paints with
the background color, so be sure you
have the color you want before you
drag. Press X to switch the foreground
and background colors.
10. Clean up your mask by painting with
black and white, as shown in the
figure.
Make sure to use short strokes so you
can undo any mistakes you make. 
11. Use the Zoom tool if you need to touch
up the details.
The Block Eraser tool has only one
size, so you have to zoom in to paint
thinner strokes and zoom out to erase
a larger area.
Remember to leave some gray around
the wispy areas, as seen in the figure;
otherwise, they may look chopped off. 
Take your time and be as accurate as
you can. Patience makes a big differ-
ence.
If you’re not sure what you need to
paint on the mask and you want to
refer to the color image, simply click
the composite channel (either RGB or
CMYK depending on your image) at the
top of the Channels palette. Then click
the mask channel again to return to
your mask. Or, you can view both the
mask and the composite simultaneously. Your mask appears as a red overlay.

Your mask is refined and ready to go.
12.Click the first icon on the left at the bottom of the Channels palette to load the
mask as a selection (or Ctrl+click [Ô+click on the Mac] the channel mask).
A selection marquee appears around your mask.
If you want to soften the edge a little, you can choose Select_Modify_Feather and
enter a value somewhere between 0.5 pixel (for a low-resolution image) to 2 pixels
(for a high-resolution image). Feathering allows for a softer, natural-looking transi-
tion between your masked element and the background. I used a 1-pixel feather for
my image.
13.Return to the composite image by
clicking the RGB channel (or CMYK if
warranted).
The selection outline appears in your
composite image, shown in the figure.
14.If you need to invert your selection,
choose Select➪Inverse.
In my example, I just filled my back-
ground with a solid color, so I left the
background selected.
15.Choose Window➪Color and mix a
color of your choice. Choose
Edit➪Fill, choose Foreground Color for
your Contents, and click OK.
Photoshop now replaces the background with a solid color. Check the edges to see
how clean your mask is.
16.Make any final edits you need to make.
My guy looked like he spent too much
time at the local tanning booth, so I toned
down the redness in his skin by using
the Variation commands (see Book VIII,
Chapter 1), as seen in the figure.
17.When you’re happy with your channel
mask, save and close the file.
It takes practice to get masking down to
a science, but believe me, it’s worth
your time. Nine times out of ten, a chan-
nel mask lends a much better selection
than any of the easier, quicker selection
tools and techniques.

Instead of filling the background with a color, you can also open a second image
and, with the Move tool, drag and drop your masked element into the second image.
A couple of things to keep in mind when compositing with two images: First try to
use two images whose lighting isn’t so dissimilar that it looks artificial. Take into
account the time of day, the angle of the light, and so on. Secondly, try to select two
images whose levels of focus make sense. If you need to soften one of the images,
apply the Gaussian Blur filter. If your mask is good, your person should look right at
home in his or her new digs.

ot an image that needs to be sharper or
maybe less dusty? How about an image that
needs to look like it was wrapped in plastic and
then xeroxed on a circa-1970 photocopier? Either
way, this is the book that describes the ﬁne-tuning
and the folly of ﬁlters. 
Filters can do wonders in correcting your images,
making them look better than the original. And if
it’s special effects you’re interested in, look no fur-
ther. Filters can make your image look ripped,
sprayed, wet, hot — and just about any other
adjective you’re interested in. The best news is
that Photoshop CS3 has given us Smart Filters —
ﬁlters that work their magic without damaging
your pixels. If distortions are more your thing, you
won’t be disappointed with the Liquify command,
for which image warping, pushing, bloating, and
puckering are daily activities.

F
ilters have a long and glorious history, ranging from performing essen-
tial tasks (such as removing abrasive particles from the oil in your car’s
crankcase) to even more important chores involving the pixels in your
Photoshop images. In both cases, filters (also called plug-ins
because they can be installed or removed from Photoshop
independently) seize tiny, almost invisible bits of stuff
and rearrange them in useful ways. The results are
something you’d never want to do without.
This chapter introduces you to the basics of
Photoshop’s filter facilities and starts you on the
road to plug-in proficiency.
You Say You Want a Convolution?
All filters do one simple thing in a seemingly compli-
cated way: They make Photoshop do your bidding. Deep
within a filter’s innards is a set of instructions that tells
Photoshop what to do with a particular pixel in an image or selec-
tion. Photoshop applies these instructions to each and every pixel in the rel-
evant area by using a process the techies call convolution (creating a form
or shape that’s folded or curved in tortuous windings), but which we
normal folk simply refer to as applying a filter.

Corrective and destructive filters
Filters fall into two basic categories, corrective and destructive:
 Corrective filters fix problems in an image. They fine-tune color, add
blur, improve sharpness, or remove such nastiness as dust and scratches.
Although corrective plug-ins can be fairly destructive to certain pixels,
in general, they don’t change the basic look of an image. You might not
even notice that a corrective filter has been applied unless you com-
pare the new version of the image with the original.
 Destructive filters tend to obliterate at least some of an image’s original
detail (some to a greater extent than others) as they add special effects.
They may overlay an image with an interesting texture, move pixels
around to create brush strokes, or distort an image with twists, waves,
or zigzags. You can often tell at a glance that a destructive filter has
been applied to an image: The special effect often looks like nothing
that exists in real life.
An unaltered image (such as the image on the left in Figure 1-1) can be
improved by using a corrective filter such as Unsharp Mask (center) or
changed dramatically with a destructive filter such as Find Edges (right).
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 1-1: Filters range in variety from the corrective (center) to the destructive (right).
Filter basics
Whether a filter is corrective or destructive, it falls into one of two camps.
Here’s the scoop:

You Say You Want a Convolution?
513
 Single-step filters: The easiest fil-
ters to use, single-step filters have
no options and use no dialog
boxes. Just choose the filter from
the menu and watch it do its stuff
on your image or selection. The
basic Blur and Sharpen filters are
single-step filters. 
 Mini-application filters: Most fil-
ters come complete with at least
one dialog box, along with (per-
haps) a few lists, buttons, and
check boxes. And almost every
mini-app filter has sliders you can
use to adjust the intensity of an
effect or parameter (see Figure 1-2).
These filters are marked in the
menus with an ellipsis (series of
dots) following their names; as
with other menu commands that
show those dots, it’s an indication
that more options are lurking.
The controls themselves are easy to master. The tricky part is learning what
the various parameters you’re using actually do. How does changing brush
size affect your image when you’re using a brush-stroke filter? What happens
when you select a particular pattern with a texturizing filter? You can read
descriptions of how various filter controls affect your image, but your best
bet is to simply experiment until you discover the effects and parameters that
work best for you. Just be sure that you save a copy of the original image; fil-
ters do permanent damage to files — modifying, adding, and deleting pixels.
Introducing Smart Filters
The last version of Photoshop gave us the great feature of Smart Objects.
This version sweetened that feature even more with the addition of Smart
Filters. In my humble opinion, Smart Filters is one of the best new features of
Version CS3. Smart Filters are the same filters we all know and love, but applied
to your image non-destructively. Technically, the filters are applied to your
pixel data but Photoshop always retains the original pixel data inside the
Smart Object. Then, each time a filter is edited Photoshop installs the original
pixel data and re-applies the filter. Never mind how its done behind the cur-
tain, just know that Smart Filters act like layer effects, appending themselves
to your layer, where they can be edited, rearranged, and deleted at any time.

Here are the steps to apply a Smart Filter:
1. Create a Smart Object by doing one of the following:
• Choose File➪Open As Smart Object. Select your file and click Open.
• In an existing file, choose File➪Place. Select your file and commit
the file once in Photoshop. 
• Select a layer in the Layers palette and choose Layer➪Smart
Objects➪Convert to Smart Object.
• Select a layer in the Layers palette and choose Filter➪Convert for
Smart Filters.
• Copy and paste Illustrator content as a Smart Object into Photoshop.
2. Choose your desired filter from the Filter menu. Any filter applied to
a Smart Object will become a Smart Filter. 
Your Smart Filter is appended beneath your Smart Object layer, as
shown in Figure 1-3.
Note that you can also apply the Shadow/Highlight and Variations
adjustments as Smart Filters.

adds a layer mask, represented by the white thumbnail in the Layers

palette, as shown in Figure 1-4.
Correspondingly you will also
see an alpha channel in the
Channels palette. 
By default, the entire filter is dis-
played, as evidenced by an all
white layer mask. But, if desired,
the application of a layer mask
enables you to selectively hide and
show the effects of the filter. If you
made a selection on the layer
before applying a Smart Filter, the
mask will reflect that selection.
For more Smart Filter masking
details see the bulleted list below.
For information on masking in gen-
eral, check out Book VI.
4. Edit the filter as often as you like
by simply double-clicking on the filter name in the Layers palette. You
can also right-mouse click (Ctrl+click on the Mac) to access a context
menu where you can choose Edit Smart Filter. 
Your filter’s dialog box appears, enabling you to adjust the parameters
as desired. Note that you cannot edit single step filters, those that don’t
display a dialog box but are automatically applied. You can, however,
Ctrl+double-click (Cmd+double click on the Mac) to reapply certain fil-
ters, such as Clouds and Render Clouds under the Render filter menu.
5. If desired, adjust the Blend modes and Opacity settings of the Smart
Filter by right-mouse clicking (Ctrl+clicking on the Mac) on the filter
line in the Layers palette to access a context menu. From that menu,
choose Edit Smart Filter Blending Options. 
In the dialog box, choose your desired blend mode from the Mode pop-
up menu. Adjust your Opacity by entering a percentage or moving the
slider. This is a great way to tone down the effect of the filter and
achieve a more subtle appearance. Doing so is similar to fading a filter
(described later in this chapter), only better because you can infinitely
edit the settings.
6. Add as many filters as you need to the Smart Object. Filters will
reside in a grouped stack.
7. If you no longer want the filter, delete it by selecting it in the Layers
palette and dragging it into the trash at the bottom of the palette. To
delete an entire Smart Filter group (multiple filters), grab the Smart
Filters line in the Layers palette and drag it into the trash. You can
also delete the filters by right mouse clicking (Ctrl+clicking on the
Mac) and choose Delete Smart Filter from the context menu.

Here’s everything else you need to know on the ins and outs of working with
Smart Filters.
 Any file format that supports layers, such as PSD, TIFF and PDF, sup-
ports Smart Filters.
 You can’t apply Extract, Liquify, Pattern Maker or Vanishing Point as
Smart Filters.
 Click the eye in the Layers palette to display or hide the individual
Smart filter. Click the eye of the Smart Filters group to toggle on or off
all of the filters.
 When executing commands, such as a transformation (scale, rotate and
so on), on a layer with a Smart Filter, Photoshop will alert you that it will
turn off the Smart Filter in the preview during the transformation and
reapply them after the transformation is complete. You may then check
the Do Not Show Again option to bypass the alert box from then on.
 You can rearrange the order of multiple filters by dragging them up or
down the list in the Layers palette.
 You can drag Smart Filters from one Smart Object layer to another. To
copy Smart Filters, press Alt (Option on the Mac) while dragging.
 In the cases of multiple filters, only a single layer mask is applied to all
filters within the group. 
 Most of the same tools used to edit regular layer masks, such as the
Brush and Gradient tools, can be used to edit Smart Filter layer masks.
 The Smart filter layer masks are not linked to the Smart Objects, so if you
move either one with the Move tool, the other will not move along with it.
 To hide the layer mask, press Shift and click on the layer mask thumb-
nail in the Layers palette. You can right mouse click (Ctrl+click on the
Mac) and choose Disable Filter mask from the context menu. 
 To delete the layer mask, drag the thumbnail to the trash at the bottom
of the Layers palette. You can also right mouse click (Ctrl+click on the
Mac) and choose Delete Filter Mask from the context menu. In addition
you can also add, subtract or intersect the mask as a selection from this
same context menu. 
 To display just the layer mask, press Alt (Option on the Mac) and click
on the layer mask thumbnail in the Layers palette.
 To add a layer mask, right mouse click (Ctrl+click on the Mac) on the
Smart Filter line in the Layers palette and choose Add Filter Mask from
the context menu.
Sometimes when converting from one color mode to another, such as when
going from RGB to CMYK, certain filters cannot be supported. Photoshop
will prompt you with an alert box saying so and ask you if you want to ras-
terize the layer or not. Rasterizing will essentially convert your Smart

Sharpening What’s Soft
517
Object to a regular layer and “fuse” your Smart Filters onto that layer. Bye,
bye Smart Filter. If you choose not to rasterize, any Smart Filters that cannot
be displayed will be annotated with an alert icon (triangle with an exclama-
tion mark) in the Layers palette.
Sharpening What’s Soft
Sometimes your images aren’t as sharp as you’d like. Sometimes your
images have a tiny bit of softening caused by scanning an image or perhaps,
by capturing a photo on your digital camera. Or, perhaps, you want only a
particular part to be sharper so that it stands out from its surroundings.
All sharpening tools operate by increasing the contrast between adjacent
pixels. If you look at a sharpened image side by side with the original ver-
sion (as shown in Figure 1-5), you see that no new information has been pro-
vided. Instead, the contrast is boosted so edges are more distinct. The dark
parts of the edges are darker; the light parts at their boundaries are lighter.
Photoshop has six main sharpening features, only five of which are actually
filters, on the Filter➪Sharpen menu. The fifth, the Sharpen tool, isn’t a filter,
strictly speaking. It’s more like a paintbrush that lets you sharpen areas
selectively by using strokes.
Figure 1-5: Sharpening an image boosts the contrast of neighboring pixels and gives the
illusion of improved focus.
Sharpen
The Sharpen filter is best used for minimal touchups in small areas. This
single-step filter increases the contrast between all the pixels in the image
or selection. Although this makes the image look sharper, it can add a grainy
look to solid areas that aren’t part of the edges.

Sharpening What’s Soft
518
Sharpen More
The Sharpen More filter, a single-step filter that increases the contrast
between pixels even more than the regular Sharpen filter. Like the Sharpen
filter, Sharpen More is best relegated to noncritical sharpening because it
doesn’t do a very good job of sharpening large areas. Also, it doesn’t pro-
vide the control you need for more intense projects.
Sharpen Edges
The Sharpen Edges filter is a single-step filter that’s superior to the Sharpen
and Sharpen More filters because it concentrates its efforts on the edges
of images, adding sharpness without making the image grainy or noisy.
It’s best used for quickie fixes.
Smart Sharpen
The newest member of the Sharpen team is definitely a keeper: Smart
Sharpen does a great job of detecting edges and sharpening them less
destructively. Like the veteran Unsharp Mask filter, this filter gives you a lot
of control over the sharpening settings, as shown in Figure 1-6. Here’s the
scoop on those settings:

 Preview: Obviously, keep this option checked so that you can take a
gander at what’s happening as you sharpen. You’ll appreciate the new
large Preview window as well.
 Basic and Advanced: The only difference between the two views is that
with the Advanced view, you are capable of controlling the amount of
sharpening in the Shadow and Highlight areas of your image. Use the fol-
lowing controls to fine-tune the amount of sharpening in your light and
dark areas:
• Fade Amount: Determine the amount of sharpening.
• Tonal Width: Specify the range of tones you wish to sharpen. Move
your slider to the right to sharpen only the darker of the shadow
areas and the lighter of the highlight areas.
• Radius: Specify the amount of space around a pixel that is used to
determine whether a pixel is in the shadow or the highlight area.
Move your slider to the right to specify a greater area.
 Settings: You can save your sharpening settings so you can load them
for later use without having to re-create them.
 Amount: Use this control to vary the amount of edge sharpening. A
higher value increases the contrast between pixels around the edges.
Your choices range from 1 percent to 500 percent. For subtle amounts of
sharpening, anything around 100 percent or less provides the effect
you’re looking for without making the image appear overly contrasty
(yes, that is a technical term) or unrealistic.
 Radius: This slider controls the width (in pixels) of the edges that the
filter will modify. The higher the value, the wider the edge that is
affected. Your range varies from 0.1 pixel (for fine control) to 64 pixels
(for broader sharpening effects). Your use of this control will vary
chiefly on the resolution of your original image. Low-resolution images
(100 pixels per inch and lower) look best when you use only a small
radius value, from a fraction of a pixel up to three or four pixels.
A small amount of sharpening may produce no visible effect on high-
resolution images, especially those with 300 ppi resolution or more.
You may need to move the slider to the 5-pixel range before you see any
effects. Regardless of the resolution of your image, setting the radius
too high may emphasize the edges of your image unrealistically — and
it boosts the contrast too much.
A good rule to consider when you select a radius is to divide your
image’s ppi resolution by 150 and then adjust from there. For example, if
you have a 150 ppi image, set the radius at 1 and then tweak from there.

 Remove: Specify the algorithm to be used to remove the blurriness in
the image. Gaussian Blur is the method used by Unsharp Mask and is
good for removing that hazy type of blurriness. Lens Blur detects and
sharpens the edges and detail in the image and does a good job of
reducing those nasty halos that can occur from sharpening. Motion
Blur reduces the blurriness that can occur when you move your camera
(or your subject moves).
 Angle: Specify the direction of motion if you choose Motion Blur as
your algorithm.
 More Accurate: Check this option, and Photoshop provides a more
accurate removal of blurriness. Takes longer, but worth the wait, as
shown in Figure 1-7.
Figure 1-7: Smart Sharpen can take your soft, mushy photo and make it come to life.
Unsharp Mask
Don’t feel bad: Everyone is confused by the name Unsharp Mask the first
time they encounter it. This filter provides a sophisticated attempt to dupli-
cate a sophisticated photographic effect called (you guessed it) unsharp
masking, in which two sheets of film are sandwiched together to create a
final image. One sheet is the original film negative (or a duplicate), and the
second is a positive image (the “normal” photograph) that’s blurred slightly.
When the two are mated together, the light and dark areas cancel each
other out, except at the edges — because of the blurring of the positive
mask, which causes the edges to spread at those points.
Unsharp masking is a tricky procedure in the darkroom. It’s much more pre-
cise in the digital realm because Photoshop can easily control the width of
the areas to be masked, as well as a relative brightness level to use before
beginning to apply the masking effect. 

Blurring What’s Sharp
521
In the Unsharp Mask dialog box, you find two of the same controls that you
have with Smart Sharpen — Amount and Radius. You also have another
option called Threshold. Threshold controls the difference in brightness
that must be present between adjacent pixels before the edge is sharpened.
That is, you need to have a distinct contrast between adjacent pixels along
an edge in order to sharpen the edge. Your choices range from brightness
values of 0 to 255. Selecting a low value emphasizes edges with very little
contrast difference (which is usually what you want). You’re generally better
off leaving this control at 0 unless your image has a lot of noise. Higher values
force Photoshop to provide edge sharpening only when adjacent pixels are
dramatically different in brightness. Increasing the threshold too much can
cause some harsh transitions between sharpened and unsharpened pixels.
In most cases, the Amount and Radius sliders are the only controls you need
to use. Threshold is most useful when the first two controls create excessive
noise in the image. You can sometimes reduce this noise by increasing the
Threshold level a little.
Sharpening always increases contrast, so you should use any of the
Sharpening tools before trying other contrast-adjusting tools. When
you’ve sharpened your image to your satisfaction, you can then use the
other contrast controls to fine-tune the image with additional contrast 
(if it’s still required).
Blurring What’s Sharp
What, me blurry? The answer is yes, if you have an image that contains
unwanted grain (the roughness or noise added by the photographic film) or,
perhaps, an ugly pattern of halftone dots used in a printed image.
You might need to blur a background to make the foreground seem sharper,
or blur a portion of an image to create an angelic glow. Here are your blur-
ring options (all on the Filter➪Blur menu):
 Average: This single-step filter calculates the average value (or color) of
the image or selection and fills the area with that average value. This
can be useful for smoothing the values of areas containing a lot of noise.
 Blur: Also a single-step filter, Blur provides overall blurring of an image.
 Blur More: This filter provides a significantly increased amount of blur-
ring than the regular, old-fashioned Blur filter.
 Box Blur: The Blur filter blurs your image in the shape of, well, a box or
square.

Blurring What’s Sharp

 Gaussian Blur: This filter offers a radius control to let you adjust the
amount of blurring more precisely. It’s also got a really cool name.
The Gaussian Blur filter is an excellent tool because it gives you a great
deal of control over the amount and type of blurring you get. That’s
especially true when compared to the single-step Blur and Blur More fil-
ters, which apply a fixed amount of blur. Use these latter two filters
when you simply want to de-sharpen an image a tad, and turn to
Gaussian Blur when you’re looking for a specific effect.
 Lens Blur: This filter simulates the blurring that can occur when you
capture an image with a camera. For details, see the sidebar “Applying
the Lens Blur filter.”
 Motion Blur: This filter simulates the blur you see in objects that are
moving.
 Radial Blur: This filter produces the kind of blur you might get when
photographing a revolving automobile tire.
 Shape Blur: The new Shape blur basically blurs your image according
to the shape you choose from the palette. The shape choices you find
are the same as those with the Custom Shape tool. Move the Radius
slider to the right for a larger blur. You can see an example of different
shape blurs in Figure 1-8.
 Smart Blur: This filter lets you control how Photoshop applies the blur
to edges and other details of the image.
 Surface Blur: This new filter blurs the surface, or interior, of the image
rather than the edges. If you want to preserve your edge details yet blur
everything else, this is your filter.

Smoothing with the Facet and Median Filters
One application for blurring an image is to reduce dust and scratches, or to
smooth away sharp edges. Here, I show you how to use the versatile Facet
and Median filters to soften an image.

Applying the Lens Blur filter
If you’ve ever played with the aperture settings
on a camera, you’re probably well aware that you
can determine how shallow or deep your depth
of field is. Depth of field relates to the plane of
focus (the areas in a photo that are in front of or
behind the focal point that remain in focus) or
how in-focus the foreground elements are when
you compare them to the background elements.
If you use a Lens Blur filter on an alpha channel
(see Book VI, Chapter 1 for more on alpha chan-
nels), the alpha channel acts as a depth map. This
is great for taking a fully focused image and cre-
ating a shallow depth of field where the foremost
object is in focus and the background elements
get blurrier the farther they are from the focal
point. You can achieve this by creating an alpha
channel filled with a white-to-black gradient —
white where you want the most focus, black
where you want the least focus or most blur.
Here is a brief description on setting the Lens
Blur filter options:
 Source: If you have an alpha channel,
select it from this pop-up menu. The Lens
Blur option interprets the various grayscale
values of the alpha channel and applies the
blur according to the value set in the Blur
Focus Distance. Choose Transparency to
make an image get blurrier as it gets more
transparent. Choose Layer Mask to apply the
blur according to the grayscale values on
the layer mask (see Book VI, Chapter 3 for
more on layer masks). If your image con-
tains none of these options, choose None.
Photoshop applies the blur on the image.
 Blur Focal Distance: Specifies how blurry or
in focus an area of the image is. Photoshop
places the grayscale values less than the
value specified in front of the plane of focus,
and those greater than the value specified
in back. Drag the slider to specify the value
or click the crosshair cursor on the part of
the image you want to be in full focus.
 Iris: The Iris settings are meant to simulate a
camera lens. Specify the shape of the lens,
as well as the radius (size of the iris), cur-
vature, and rotation of that shape.
 Specular Highlights: The Lens Blur filter
averages the highlights of an image, which,
left uncorrected, cause some highlights to
appear grayish. These controls help to retain
specular highlights, or those highlights,
which should appear very white. Set the
Threshold value to specify which highlights
should be specular, or remain white. Set a
Brightness value to specify how much to re-
lighten any blurred areas.
 Noise: Blurring of course obliterates any
noise, or film grain, an image may have. This
can cause the image to appear inconsistent
or unrealistic in many cases. Drag the slider
to add noise back into your image.

Smoothing with the Facet and Median Filters
524
Although the Facet and Median filters smooth images by eliminating some
detail, you can compensate for the blurring effect by applying the Smart
Sharpen or Unsharp Mask with a low radius setting to sharpen things up
a little.
The Facet filter
Facet breaks up an image using a posterizing effect. It gathers up blocks of
pixels that are similar in brightness and converts them to a single value,
using geometric shapes. (When you posterize an image, you reduce it to a
very small number of tones.)
The geometric shapes make the image look more randomly produced, while
eliminating much of the banding effect you get with conventional posteriz-
ing filters.
The effects of the Facet filter are subtle, and best viewed at close range. The
original image in Figure 1-9 contains some dust, scratches, and a few other
defects. Instead of retouching them one by one, I used Facet.
Facet is a single-step filter, so you don’t need to adjust any controls. Just
choose Filter➪Pixelate➪Facet and evaluate your results. You can apply the
filter multiple times. However, even one application smooths out the picture
and eliminates the worst of the artifacts.
If you apply the Facet filter multiple times, your image takes on a kind of
pointillist, stroked look that becomes obvious. Using the filter over and over
on the same image can yield quite interesting special effects.
The Median filter
The Median filter (look for it on the Filter➪Noise menu) operates similarly
to the Facet filter in that it reduces the difference between adjacent pixels
by changing the values of some of them. In this case, it assigns the median
values of a group of pixels to the center pixel in the group.
Unlike the Facet filter, the Median filter gives you a bit of control. You can
choose the radius of the group that Photoshop uses to calculate the median
value.
Median tends to make an image look a bit blurrier because it reduces the
contrast of adjacent pixels. However, it does a good job of smoothing the
image and removing artifacts.

Creating an Angelic Glow
Sometimes, a little blur can add a soft, romantic mood or angelic glow that can improve
glamour photos, pictures of kids, or even something as mundane as a flower. The secret
is to apply only enough blurring to provide the soft effect you want without completely
obliterating your original subject. This assumes, of course, that your subject doesn’t
deserve obliteration, that the kids are your own (or those of a close friend or relative),
and are, in fact, of that rare angelic variety.
continued

Smoothing with the Facet and Median Filters
526
You won’t want to use this effect on other subjects, such as men, who generally like a
rugged, masculine appearance. Many senior citizens regard the age lines on their faces
as badges of distinction earned over a long, rewarding life. Don’t try softening them up
with glowing effects, either.
To add an angelic glow to your little angel, just follow
these steps:
1. Open the image in Photoshop.
I used one of a cute little girl.
2. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer to create a copy of
the image layer.
3. Select Image➪Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur.
Gaussian blur softens the upper layer, producing an
airy glow.
4. Move the Radius slider to the right to
produce a moderate amount of blur,
and then click OK to apply the blurring
effect, as shown in the figure.
I used a value of 7.
5. In the Layers palette, choose Lighten
from the Modes pop-up menu.
6. Use the Opacity slider (click the right-
pointing arrow to access the slider) to
reduce the amount of glow (if it’s too
much for your tastes).
I reduced my Opacity to 65 percent.
7. Choose Layer➪Flatten Image to com-
bine all the layers.
Experiment with different amounts of Gaussian Blur
until you find the perfect glowing effect, as I did in
my figure.
When Photoshop applies the Lighten mode as it
merges two layers, it looks at each pixel in the top
layer — and at each corresponding pixel in the layer
below. In the final merged layer, that lower pixel is
always the lighter of the two. The result is an image
in which Photoshop replaces darker pixels with
lighter ones, but doesn’t change the light pixels at all.

Fading a Filter
527
Applying a Filter Again
You can reapply the last filter you worked with — using the same settings —
by pressing Ctrl+F (Ô+F on the Mac). (It’s also the first command on the
Filter menu.) You might want to do this to strengthen the effect of a filter on
a particular image, layer, or selection. Or you simply may want to apply the
same filter to a succession of images or selections.
To bring up the dialog box for the last filter you applied, press Ctrl+Alt+F
(Windows) or Ô+Option+F (Mac). This shortcut can be very useful when
you apply a filter and then decide you want to go back and use different set-
tings. After applying the filter, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on a Mac) to undo, and
then press Ctrl+Alt+F (Ô+Option+F on a Mac) to bring up the filter’s dialog
box. The dialog box opens with the settings you used last time, allowing you
to make adjustments and then reapply the filter.
Fading a Filter
Some times you may not want the full effects of a filter applied to your
image or selection. Often applying a filter full strength tends to give it that
artificial “Photoshopped” look. Photoshop has a handy Fade Filter facility
that lets you control the intensity of the filter’s effects. You can access this
feature by choosing Edit➪Fade, or by pressing Shift+Ctrl+F (Shift+Ô+F on
the Mac). The Fade Filter facility also has a Preview option so you can pre-
view the changes you’re making to the original image.
You must fade your filter immediately after you use the filter. If you use a
painting or editing tool after applying the filter, for example, you won’t find
Fade Filter on the Edit menu anymore. Photoshop replaces it with Fade
Brush or something else.
You can also add a fade effect in the following ways:
 Adjust opacity settings: Just about every filter allows you to adjust
opacity, so most of the time the Opacity slider is all you need to adjust
the strength of the filter applied to your image.
 Use a blending mode: Use one of the blend modes in Photoshop to
merge the filter effect with the original image. For more on blend modes,
see Book V, Chapter 3.
 Apply a filter to a duplicate layer or a selection on that layer: Then
adjust the opacity of the filtered layer so it merges with the unfiltered
layer below it.

Selectively Applying a Filter
528
One advantage to this method is that you can selectively erase portions
of the filtered image to allow the unaltered portion to show through.
For example, you can apply a blur filter to a face and then erase the
blurred portion that covers the eyes to make them a focal point of the
portrait.
You could just select the face (minus the eyes) and blur only that
with the filter, but using multiple layers gives you more flexibility.
You can also fade a filter by using a layer mask to selectively hide or
show the filtered area. Find out more about layer masks in Book VI,
Chapter 3.
Remember that you can also apply a Smart Filter to your layer or selection.
By doing so you get the utmost flexibility in editing the filter’s opacity and
blend modes, not just once but infinitely. For more see the section
“Introducing Smart Filters” earlier in this chapter.
Selectively Applying a Filter
You don’t need to apply filters to an entire image or an entire layer. You can
achieve some of the best effects when you apply a filter to only a portion of
an image, say to an object in the foreground, but not on the background.
Your choices include the following:
 Selections: Make a selection and apply the filter only to that selection.
You can use Quick Mask mode (see Book VI, Chapter 2) to paint a 
selection. This technique can give you a high degree of control; it
even lets you feather the edges of the selection so the filter effect
fades out.
 Channels: You can store selections as alpha channels, visible in the
Channels palette, of course. But you can also choose to apply a filter to
only one of the other channels, such as the Red, Green, or Blue chan-
nels in an RGB image. This is a good way to create a filter effect that’s
applied to only one color in an image. (Check out Book VI, Chapter 1 for
information about channels.)
Because Smart Filters come equipped with their own layer mask, you are
able to selectively apply the filter to your layer in varying percentages.
For details, see the section “Introducing Smart Filters” earlier in this 
chapter.

Putting It Together
Sprucing Up a Scanned Halftone
Publications use only a limited number of ink colors to reproduce a photograph. Every
tone you see in a black-and-white image must be reproduced by using pure black ink and
the white (okay, dirty beige) of the paper. Full-color images are represented by combining
CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black). Printers can’t use various shades of gray ink to
create grayscale photos. They also can’t use different strengths of color inks to generate
the rainbow of hues you see in an image on-screen. To get at least some of that subtlety,
photographs have to be converted to a pattern of dots before they can be printed.
Our eyes blend the dots together to produce the illusion of a grayscale or color image
with smooth gradations of tone. However, a problem arises if you want to reuse a photo-
graph and don’t have access to the original. Scanners can capture the halftone dots, but
the resulting image usually has an unpleasant pattern called moiré.
You have several ways of reducing the moiré effect, usually by blurring the image so that
the dots merge and the underlying pattern vanishes. Many scanners have a descreen
setting that partially eliminates the effect, but that setting sometimes actually blurs your
image more than you’d like. Fortunately, you can usually do a pretty good job in
Photoshop. But remember that, if there is any way possible, scanning from continuous-
tone images always yields the best quality.
In the following steps, I demonstrate an easier way (over the years I managed to lose the
original negative and print). You can see the dreadful moiré pattern that resulted when I
scanned the clip.
To rid your scanned halftone print of bothersome moiré, follow these steps:
1. Open the image in Photoshop.
2. Zoom in so you can see the halftone
pattern clearly as you work, as shown
in the figure.
3. Choose Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur.
The Gaussian Blur dialog box appears.
Note that you can also first convert
your image to a Smart Object and then
apply your Gaussian blur and Smart
Sharpen filters as Smart Filters. See
the section “Introducing Smart filters”
earlier in this chapter.
continued

Selectively Applying a Filter
530
4. Move the Radius slider to the right
until the halftone pattern is blurred,
and then click OK to apply the blur.
I used a value of 1.7 pixels in my figure.
5. Choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Smart
Sharpen to restore some of the image’s
sharpness now that you’ve eliminated
the pattern. Choose Gaussian Blur for
the Remove algorithm.
As long as the Radius value for the
Smart Sharpen filter doesn’t exceed
the radius of the Gaussian Blur that
you first applied, the two filters won’t
cancel each other out. You want the sharpening to make the details of the image
crisper without bringing back those blurred halftone dots.
6. Move the Amount slider to the right to
sharpen the image.
Try to find a setting that does the job
without making the image appear unnat-
urally sharp or show too much contrast.
I used 150 percent in my figure.
In most cases, leaving the Threshold at
0 is fine. Calculate a starting Radius
value by dividing the ppi (pixels per
inch) of the scanned image by 150. If a
moiré pattern reappears, reduce the
Radius value.
7. Click OK to apply the sharpness.
The result of my blur-and-sharpen exercise is shown in the figure.

P
hotoshop has dozens of filters that let you enhance your
image in unusual ways. You can create Old Masters
portraits from common snapshots, shatter your image
into a thousand sparkling pieces, create clouds in a
cloudless sky, create stained glass, or perform hun-
dreds of other tricks.
The big challenge in using these filters is learning
what each filter can do and how to apply it to the
best effect. This chapter introduces you to more of
those fabulous Photoshop plug-ins — and shows
you some typical applications for them. Several
Putting-It-Together projects have step-by-step
instructions. For the first few examples, I provide you
with the settings I used to achieve particular looks.
However, filter effects vary greatly when applied to different
images, so you’ll have to play with the filter controls yourself
when you use these techniques with your own images.
You can apply a filter to a layer, selection, or channel. And you can also fade
a filter, change opacity settings, and use layer masks to soften the effects of
filters. In fact, in some cases, you may have to decrease the effect of a filter
because full strength can look overdone. On the other hand, when applied
selectively, the same filter may look subtle and sophisticated. Although fil-
ters can be a blast to play with, you want to exercise some restraint when
applying them for a real project. Getting carried away with the effects is
easy when often the simplest effect is the most beautiful.

Working in the Filter Gallery
532
Working in the Filter Gallery
The Filter Gallery (a dialog box-like gizmo that Adobe refers to as an editing
window) gives us an alternative route to access and apply filters. To put it
on-screen, choose Filter➪Filter Gallery. Here you can apply multiple filters,
as well as edit or delete them later. This feature has made filters more flexi-
ble, more user-friendly, and easier to apply.
Here are the steps to get you up and running in the Filter Gallery:
1. Choose Filter➪Filter Gallery.
The Filter Gallery dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-1.
2. Click your desired filter category folder.
The folder expands and displays the filters in that category. A thumb-
nail illustrating the filter’s effect accompanies each filter. To collapse
the filter category folder, simply click it again.
3. Select the filter you want to apply.
You can also choose your filter from the filter pop-up menu, shown in
Figure 2-1.
4. Specify any settings associated with the filter.

You get a large preview of your image in the left side of the dialog box.
Use the magnification controls to zoom in and out of the preview.
As you change your settings, the preview dynamically updates itself.
To preview a different filter, simply select it.
Note that if you want your custom settings to be the new default for the
filter, simply press the Ctrl key (Ô key on the Mac). The Cancel button
changes to Default. Click it and your settings are now the new default.
5. When you are happy with the filter, click OK to apply the filter and
exit the dialog box.
6. If you want to apply another filter, click the New effect layer button at
the bottom of the dialog box.
This duplicates the existing filter. 
7. Choose your new filter, which then replaces the duplicate.
Photoshop lists each of the filters you apply to the image in the bottom
right of the dialog box. 
8. When you’re done, click OK to apply the second filter and exit the
dialog box.
You can apply as many filters as you want to your image. But often less
is more.
Here are some other helpful tips to keep in mind when you’re using the
Filter Gallery:
 To delete an applied filter, select it and click the Delete effect layer
button (the trash icon).
 To edit an applied filter’s settings, select it in the list and make any nec-
essary changes. Click OK to reapply. Note that while you can edit a 
particular filter’s settings, that edit affects any subsequent filters you
have made after applying that particular filter.
 You can rearrange the order of the applied filters. Simply select and
drag the filter up or down within the list. 
Rearranging the order of the applied filters changes the resulting effect
of the filters.
 To resize the Filter Gallery dialog box, drag the lower-right corner.
 To hide the Filter menu and provide the maximum real estate for the
preview box, click the arrow to the left of the OK button.
 Note that you can also choose any of the filters found in the Filter
Gallery from the Filter menu itself. Doing so launches the Filter Gallery
automatically — though not all filters are available in the Filter Gallery.
You have to access some of them individually from the Filter menu.

Getting Artsy
534
Don’t be misled into thinking that the Filter Gallery is like Layer Styles
where the styles can be removed and the underlying pixel data is returned
to its pristine, original state. Regular filters change the pixels of an image
permanently and after you apply one, you can’t remove it. So be sure that
you really like what you’ve done and that you have a backup copy of that
precious family photo or critical project image.
That being said, if you do want your filters to act like Layer Styles, there is
now a way. You can now apply a Smart Filter to any layer that you first 
convert into a Smart Object. Smart Filters enable you to apply filter non-
destructively, without altering any underlying pixels. For more on Smart
Filters, see Book VII, Chapter 1.
Getting Artsy
Quite a few of the Photoshop filters produce artistic effects. You’ll find a
large collection of them on the Sketch and Stylize submenus. However, the
Artistic menu contains 15 versatile filters that you can use to add brush
strokes to your images, wrap them in plastic, create poster-like effects, and
manufacture other interesting looks.
Many Photoshop users employ these
filters to create images that look as if
they were painted. What they might
not tell you, unless pressed, is that
artsy filters can make terrible photos
look better — or in some cases, pretty
darn good. These filters can disguise a
multitude of photographic sins, turn-
ing shoebox rejects into pretty decent
digital transformations. The photo of a
clock in Figure 2-2 is, arguably, not
very interesting — and (worse) it’s
blurry. I moved the camera as I was
taking the photo.
To improve this image, I employed fil-
ters on the Filter➪Artistic menu. Try one of the following filters:
 Poster Edges: A quick application of this filter improves the photo
100 percent. (See Figure 2-3.) The filter not only gives the picture an
artsy, poster-like look, but also enhances the edges to make the clock’s
outline appear sharper.
I set the Poster Edges filter’s Edge Thickness to 4, bumped the Edge
Intensity up to a value of 6 to create dramatic-looking edges, and set the
Posterization level to 6 to allow more tones for a bit more realism.
Figure 2-2: This photo is not that
interesting and slightly out of focus.

Stroking Your Image with Filters

 Rough Pastels: This filter, shown in the right photo in Figure 2-3, gives
the look of a fine art piece created with oil pastels. I used the settings of
8 for the Stroke Length and Stroke Detail, 100 percent Scale and 20 for
Relief. I left my light source at Bottom.
 The Dry Brush: This filter can add an even more stylistic effect, reduc-
ing details down to a series of broad strokes.
 Colored Pencil: This filter crosshatches the edges of your image to
create a pencil-like effect.
 Cutout: This effect assembles an image from what looks like cut-out
paper shapes, which resemble a kid’s art project.
 Film Grain: This photographic effect diffuses an image with thousands of
tiny dots that simulate clumps of film grain. (Think of old home movies.)
 Fresco: This effect looks (supposedly) like pigments applied to fresh,
wet plaster. Okay, I guess . . . if you squint.
 Paint Daubs: This effect uses smears of color from your choice of a half-
dozen different brush types. Very Jackson Pollock.
 Plastic Wrap: This filter can produce a wet look, particularly when you
apply it to a selection and then fade the filter so it doesn’t overpower
the detail in your image.
 Watercolor: This is a nice pastel effect that diffuses an image while
adding an interesting, watery texture.
Figure 2-3: The Poster Edges filter (left) and the Rough Pastels filter (right) helps.
Stroking Your Image with Filters
You can find more stroking filters on the Brush Strokes submenu, with some

An attractive border can give your image an edge. If you want an edgy look or want to
take your work right to the edge, you can apply this next technique faster than you can
say, “Overworked metaphor!” Photoshop lets you apply deckled looks and other effects

Distorting for Fun
With a couple exceptions, Photoshop’s Distortion filters twist, turn, and
bend your images in surprising ways, turning ordinary objects into wavy
images, pinched shapes, and bloated spheres.
The first exception? The Diffuse Glow filter distorts images only to the
extent that it imbues them with a soft, romantic, fuzzy look that can make
the sharpest image look positively ethereal.
I’ve never figured out why Adobe dumped this useful filter in the Distort
submenu, but there it is. (And here it is applied to a girl in Figure 2-5.)
The second exception is the Lens Correction filter, which fixes distortions
caused by the camera lens. In the dialog box, you find settings to correct
barrel and pincushion distortions, where straight lines appear (respectively)
bowed out or in. Select the Remove Distortion tool and drag on the image —
or you can also drag the Remove Distortion slider. Use the Straighten tool
to rotate a tilted image, as shown in Figure 2-6. You can also correct per-
spective issues by using the Transform sliders of Vertical and Horizontal
Perspective. If your images suffer from vignetting (where the edges are

darker than the center), slide the Vignette slider to correct the problem.
Finally, got colored fringe around your subjects? Photographers call
this nastiness chromatic aberration. Fringe, abberation, whatever it’s
called — get rid of it by using the Red/Cyan or Blue/Yellow Fringe sliders.
The Move Grid, Hand, and Zoom tools help make your adjustments more
user-friendly.

choose Load Texture.
Pumping Up the Noise
Noise in images consists of any graininess or texture that occurs, either
because of the inherent quality of the image or through the editing process.
Noise filters, like the Photoshop Add Noise plug-in, produce random texture
and grain in an image. If you’re new to image editing, you might wonder why
you’d want to add noise to an image in the first place. Wouldn’t it be smarter
to remove it? Well, sometimes. In practice, you’ll find lots of applications
that call for a little noise here and there:
 To add texture: Objects that become too smooth, either because of
blurring or other image editing you may have done, often look better
when you add some noise to give them a texture. This technique is par-
ticularly useful if one object in an image has been edited, smoothed, or
blurred more than the other objects in the image.
 To blend foreign objects into a scene: When you drop a new object into
the middle of an existing scene, you’ll often find that the amount of grain
or noise in the new object is quite different from the objects it’s joining.
For example, say you’ve decided to take a photo of your house and want
to insert a certain luxury car in your driveway. Unfortunately, your digi-
tal photo of your brother-in-law’s luxo-mobile is a lot sharper than the
picture of your house. Adding a little noise can help the two objects
blend more realistically. You may even forget that the car isn’t yours.
 To improve image quality: Images that contain smooth gradients often
don’t print well because some printers are unable to reproduce the
subtle blend of colors from one hue to another. The result is objection-
able banding in your printed image: You can see distinct stripes as the
colors progress from one to another. Adding a little noise can break up
the gradient enough that your printer can reproduce the blend of colors,
and the noise/grain itself is virtually invisible on the printed sheet.

Pumping Down the Noise
542
Pumping Down the Noise
Although the Add Noise filter adds grain, the other filters in the Noise 
submenu don’t add noise at all; instead, they make noise and artifacts
(flaws such as the dust and scratches on old film) less noticeable. Choose
Filter➪Noise to find your tools, which include:
 Despeckle: This filter makes dust spots in your image less noticeable
by decreasing the contrast of your entire image — except at the edges.
That translates into a slightly blurry image (which masks the spots) that
still retains sharpness along the edges of image components. You end
up with a little blur to soften the image, but enough detail in the edges
that the picture still looks good.
 Dust & Scratches: This filter concentrates its blurring effect on only
those areas of your image that contain scratches and other artifacts.
Photoshop performs this magic by looking at each pixel in an image,
moving out in a radial direction until it encounters an abrupt transition
in tone. (That’s a signal that a spot or scratch has been found.) You can
specify the radius Photoshop searches for the little culprits, from 1 to
100 pixels. Be careful not to overdo it. Too much of this filter can oblit-
erate the detail in the image. If you journey to the world of mush, try
using Edit➪Fade right after you apply the filter.
While working with any of the Noise filters, being very conservative
at first is best. All the Noise filters involve destruction of image data.
Remember, that’s just the nature of filters in general — changing pixel
data. A little bit can help — and be just the effect you’re looking for. Just
a little bit more, however, may completely wreck things.
 Median: This filter reduces contrast around dust motes, thus hiding
them, in a slightly different way. This filter looks at the pixels surround-
ing each pixel in the image and replaces the center one with a new pixel
that has the median brightness level of that group. The process is a
little hard to describe succinctly, but basically, the bright spots darken
while the rest of the image isn’t affected.
 Reduce Noise: This filter, shown in Figure 2-8, is designed to remove
luminance noise and JPEG artifacts that can appear on digital photos.
Luminance noise is grayscale noise that makes images look overly
grainy. Here is some info on the options:
• Strength: Specify the amount of noise reduction. Note that you can
reduce noise in the Overall image or (if you click the Advanced
button) channel by channel. 
Be sure to check out the Blue channel in particular. It’s often the
channel that captures all the crud.

Breaking Your Image into Pieces

• Preserve Details: A higher number preserves edges and details but
reduces the amount of noise removal. Find a happy medium.
• Reduce Color Noise: Removes random colored pixel artifacts.
• Sharpen Details: Counteracts the fact that removing noise reduces
sharpness as well.
• Remove JPEG Artifact: Check this option to remove the annoying
blocks and halos that can occur from low-quality JPEG compression.
You can also save and reload your settings.
Figure 2-8: The Reduce Noise filter attempts to remove noise while 
retaining some sharpness in edges and details.
Breaking Your Image into Pieces
The Pixelate filters in Photoshop break up your images into bits and pieces,
providing more of those painterly effects you can get with brush strokes and
artistic filters.
The Pixelate submenu includes the Crystallize filter applied to the little girl
shown in Figure 2-9, as well as plug-ins that produce color halftone effects,
fragmented images, and the Pointillism effect (used in the “Creating Snow
and Rain” Putting-It-Together project later in this chapter).

Rendering
In computerese, rendering means creating something from nothing, in a way.
That’s why rendering filters in Photoshop all produce special effects by cre-
ating a look, object, or lighting effect that’s melded with your original image.
Using the Clouds filter
The Clouds filter can muster a sky full of clouds from scratch with a few
clicks of the mouse, as in the now-cloudy picture shown in Figure 2-10.
This filter creates clouds using random values from between the foreground
and background colors. Indeed, most Photoshop veterans use this filter so
much that they have a surprising number of clouds in their images. Find it
at Filter➪Render➪Clouds. To create a more contrasty cloud effect, press Alt
(Option on the Mac) when choosing the command. If you don’t like the first
set of clouds you get, apply the filter again and again until you do. If you
want a more “realistic” sky, try using a dark sky blue for your foreground
color and a very light blue, or white, color for your background color.

 Difference Clouds: Use this filter to create puffy objects in the sky (or
foggy clouds at lower levels). Instead of performing this magical feat the
way the Clouds filter does, the Difference Clouds filter uses image infor-
mation to figure the difference in pixel values between the new clouds
and the image they’re joining. The result is a unique cloud effect. Try
applying the filter repeatedly to create a marbleized effect.
 Lens Flare: This filter creates the reflection effect that plagues photogra-
phers when they point their cameras toward a strong light source, such
as the sun. Photoshop mimics several different kinds of photographic
lenses, giving you useful flares that can spice up concert photos, add a
sunset where none existed, and create other kinds of lighting bursts.
In the Lens Flare dialog box, specify a location for the center of the flare
by clicking the image thumbnail or dragging the crosshair.
 Lighting Effects: As a sort of photo-studio lighting setup, this filter uses
pixels to do its work. You can set up 16 different lights and manipulate
how they illuminate your photo.
 Texture Fill: This filter fills an area with a grayscale image. Select the
filter and open the image you want to use as the texture fill.
Note that if you’re looking for the 3D Transform filter, it was given the ax in
Version CS3.

Creating Snow and Rain
Sometimes you may come across a photo that needs a little bit of atmosphere thrown in to
give it extra punch. And I mean atmosphere literally. By using a couple of filters and a
blend mode, you can add some rain or snow to any image. Just follow these steps to
create either rain or snow:
1. Open a color image. It if isn’t currently
in RGB Mode, then choose
Image➪Mode➪RGB Color.
Make sure you’re in RGB mode; the
blend mode used in these steps doesn’t
work correctly with CMYK images.
2. Drag the background layer to the
Create a New Layer icon at the bottom

You now see a layer that says
Background copy in the Layers palette.

3. Double-click the name Background copy and type Snow.
This isn’t a mandatory step. I’m just being ultra-organized.
4. With the Snow layer active, choose
Filter➪Pixelate➪Pointillize. In the
dialog box, set your cell size to 7 or a
value you prefer. Click OK.
The bigger the cell size, the bigger the
snowflakes or raindrops.
For rain, you might try a cell size of 3,
which is the minimum, or 4. For snow,
try a larger cell size, between 6 and 9. I
used a value of 7 in my image.
5. On the Snow layer, choose Image➪
Adjustments➪Threshold. Move the slider all the way to the right, to a max value of 255.
This adjustment takes the colored cells and turns them to either black or white.
By using a value of 255, all brightness
values less than 255 turn black and the
remaining value turns white.
6. On the Snow layer, choose Screen
from the Mode pop-up menu in the
Layers palette.
The Screen blend mode lightens the
Snow layer, where it mixes with the
background. Blending with black
pixels has no effect, therefore they
drop out, as shown in the figure.
7. Choose Filter➪Blur➪Motion Blur. In the dialog box, specify the Angle and
Distance values.
If you want the wind to appear to be
blowing hard, set the angle more diag-
onally, around 45 degrees. If you want
the weather to appear to be coming
straight down, set the angle to 90
degrees. Setting the distance elon-
gates the pointillized cells that you
created in Step 4, making them look a
little more realistic. For snow, start
with a range of about 8 to 12 pixels. For
rain, start a little higher, 15 to 25 pixels.
I used a value of 12 pixels in my figure.

If you’re creating rain, proceed to Step 8. If you’re a snow person, you’re done as
shown in the following figure.
8. Choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask.
The Unsharp Mask dialog box appears.
9. Specify the Amount, Radius, and Threshold values.
The Unsharp Mask filter gives the illusion of sharpening the focus of the image by
increasing the contrast between the pixels. 
I used an amount of 500 percent, a Radius of 1, and kept the Threshold at 0. This
gives the raindrops a little more definition.
10.Choose Filter➪Blur➪Motion Blur. In
the dialog box, specify the Angle and
Distance values.
Again, the angle is up to you, but make
it consistent with the value that you
used in Step 7. Set the distance
according to how you want your rain
to appear, a moderate spring rain or a
torrential, close-to-hurricane type of
downpour. In my image that follows,
I used 45 degrees and 25 pixels.

Getting Organic with the Sketch Filters
The Sketch filter menu contains a few filters that don’t really belong there.
That’s because many current Photoshop filters were acquired from Aldus
Corporation (now defunct), and Adobe had to shoehorn them into the orga-
nizational structure of Photoshop. But no matter — they work nonetheless.
If you were to encounter a picture of Michelangelo’s David, shown in
Figure 2-11, you might be tempted to sketch the famous sculpture by
using one of the filters you find when you choose Filter➪Sketch.
Perhaps a Conté Crayon effect or a Graphic Pen and Ink look would be nice.
But the Sketch submenu also includes other artistic effects, such as the
Note Paper look, a halftone screen, chalk and charcoal, and even a bas-relief
effect that turns flat images into a Michelangelo-esque sculpture.

 Plaster creates a look that resembles molten plastic more than it looks
like plaster. The filter uses the foreground and background values to
color the image.
 Stamp mimics a rubber or wooden-block stamp (not very sketch-like,
indeed!).
 Reticulation adds texture by reproducing a veritable photographic dis-
aster: The wrinkling of film emulsion that occurs when you move film
from one developing chemical to another that has an extreme difference
in temperature (think hot developer followed by a bath in cold water).
The highlights look grainy; the shadow areas look thick and goopy.
 Torn Edges creates the look of ragged paper and colorizes the image,
using the foreground and background colors.
 Water Paper creates the look of paint-like daubs on fibrous wet paper.
Even if the Sketch filters don’t all produce sketchy effects, they do have
one thing in common: They give your images an organic look that’s
decidedly uncomputer-like.
Putting It Together
Adding Water Droplets and Other Wet Effects
You can find lots of techniques for creating nice, neat round drops of water by using
Photoshop. Unless you’ve just waxed your car and expect a rain shower within moments,
however, perfectly beaded water droplets can be fairly rare. In real life, you’re likely to
encounter some sloppy drops and driblets. This technique simulates that look. You could
use it to add sparkling water drops to a flower, create a wet-look texture for artistic
effect, or add a three-dimensional trompe l’oeil (“fools the eye”) optical illusion. Find the
flower image I use on this book’s companion Web site if you’d like to follow along.
1. Open a plain, old, bone dry photograph in
Photoshop.
I’m using a flower photograph, which will look great
wet.
2. Press D to make sure you have the foreground and
background colors in Photoshop set to the default
values of black and white.

3. Choose Window➪Channels, choose New Channel from the palette menu.
This creates a new alpha channel for the water droplets. (For more on channels,

4. In the Color Indicates area of the New Channel dialog box, select the Selected
Areas radio button, and set Opacity to 100 percent.
5. Select Filter➪Render➪Clouds to create a motley
cloud effect to use as the basis for your random
water droplets.
6. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Threshold, and then
move the slider to create black blotches that will
become water droplets, as shown in the figure.
I used a value of 83, but, because the Clouds filter
produces random results, you may find that a differ-
ent value works better for you.
7. Choose Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur and move the
Radius slider enough to blur the jagged edges of
the droplets.
I used a value of 3.8 pixels.
8. Choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask and adjust
the Amount and Radius sliders to firm up the edges
of the droplets.
I found that an Amount of 85 percent and a Radius of
about 46 creates soft-edged-but-distinct water
droplets, as shown in the figure.

Adding Texture

Adding Texture
Photoshop lets you add lots of interesting textures to your images, which
are on the Filter➪Texture menu, such as the cracked canvas effect gener-
ated by the Craquelure filter (see Figure 2-12), or the pixel effect produced
by the Patchwork filter. 
You can find other filters on this menu to help you create mosaic effects,
add yet another kind of film grain, and create stained-glass effects in your
images. But the most versatile filter in this set is the Texturizer, shown in
Figure 2-13. The Texturizer filter enables you to apply various kinds of tex-
tures to your images or selections, including Canvas, Sandstone, Burlap, or
Brick.
You can choose the relative size of the texture compared to the rest of your
image by using the Scaling slider, and govern the 3-D relief effect. You can
even select the direction of the light source that produces the 3-D look,
choosing from top, bottom, either side, or any of the four corners of the
image. If those variations aren’t enough for you, then create your own tex-
ture, save it as a Photoshop PSD file, and use that to texturize your image.
You can find a handful of other filters that allow you to load your own tex-
tures, including Rough Pastels, Underpainting, and Conté Crayon.
12.Choose Layer➪Layer Style and select Bevel and Emboss. Specify your options and
click OK.
The bevel/embossing effect adds a third dimension to the drops. You can experiment
with the depth and size controls to get
the exact effect you want. I used the
Inner Bevel style, set to the Smooth
Technique in the Structure area of the
dialog box. I used the sliders to increase
the size of the bevel to 27 pixels, and
softened the edges by 11 pixels.

Adjustments➪Levels to darken the
droplets against their background.
The final image looks like a print that

Looking at the Other Filters
The Video and Other categories are the home of the oddest of the odd. For
example, the Other submenu is home to the Custom filter, which is no filter
at all — but rather a dialog box with a matrix in which you can type num-
bers that Photoshop uses to process the pixels in your image in unexpected
ways. The center box in the matrix represents a pixel in your image; the sur-
rounding boxes represent the pixels that surround that pixel. The numbers
you type tell Photoshop whether to darken or lighten pixels. You can experi-
ment to see what will happen, and if you like the effect, tell all your friends
that you meant to do that.
The High Pass filter, also in the Other category, applies an effect opposite to
the Gaussian Blur filter. It finds and keeps the details in the edges where it
finds distinct color or tonal differences and turns the rest of the image gray.
When converting a continuous-tone image into a bitmap (black and white
only) image, applying this filter is useful before applying the Threshold adjust-
ment. See Book VIII, Chapter 1 for more on the Threshold command. It’s also
handy for creating a channel mask. (See Book VI, Chapter 3 for details.)
Two other filters that help with masking are the Minimum and Maximum fil-
ters. The Minimum filter expands the black areas while decreasing white areas
(a process known as choking in traditional photography). The Maximum
filter expands the white portions while decreasing black areas (known as
spreading). The radius value you enter tells the filter how many pixels to
expand or decrease from the edges of your selection.
The Video menu contains its own share of strange filters, including the NTSC
Colors filter, which performs the rather obscure function of converting all
the colors in your image to match the colors used for television reproduction.
(NTSC stands for National Television Systems Committee.) You’d use this
filter to process digital presentations or slides to be shown on television,
if you were really, really particular about how the colors are portrayed.

L
iquify is the only Photoshop filter that gets a chapter of its own. But then
again, Liquify is no ordinary filter; it’s the ultimate in image distortion
tools, and therefore a good deal more complex than most of its kin on the
Filter menu. What other filter has its own hefty tools palette, loads of
buttons, several different modes, and more than a dozen option
categories with what amount to dozens more variations?
The Liquify command lets you push and pull on parts of
your image; twist, turn, and pinch other parts; bloat
sections; freeze portions in place so that they remain
immune to the transformations going around them;
and perform selective reconstructions if you don’t
like everything you’ve done. You can perform this
magic with a remarkable degree of control, too.
This chapter explores all the features of the Liquify
command, and shows you how to use them to create
sensational images.
Exploring the Liquify Window
At first glance, the Liquify window is a little daunting. It’s a little daunting on
second, third, and fourth glances, too. But when you quit glancing and dive
into this versatile filter, you’ll find that the tools and options make a lot of
sense.

Exploring the Liquify Window
556
The Liquify Tools palette resides at the left side of the Liquify window
shown in Figure 3-1. The other options available with Liquify (which I
describe later in the section appropriately named “The Options Areas”)
appear at the right side of the window. The Tools palette includes a dozen
tools that you can use to paint and distort your image. 
As with Photoshop’s main Tools palette, you can activate each tool by
pressing a letter associated with its name. 
Figure 3-1: The intimidating Liquify window is really quite user-friendly after you get familiar
with its tools and settings.
The painting tools
The first group of tools is used to paint distortions on your image. Shown in
this list with their keyboard shortcuts in parentheses, the
painting tools are (refer to Figure 3-1):
 Forward Warp (W): This tool is faintly reminiscent of
the Smudge tool, but it doesn’t blur the pixels quite as
much as it pushes them forward as you drag, creating
a stretched effect. Use the Warp tool to push pixels
where you want them to go, using short strokes or
long pushes.

Exploring the Liquify Window
557
When compared to a tool like the Smudge tool, which tends to destroy
detail, the Warp tool can preserve detail within distortions.
 Twirl Clockwise (C): Place the cursor in one spot, press
the mouse button, and watch the pixels under your
brush rotate like a satellite photo of a tropical storm.
Or drag the cursor to create a moving twirl effect.
Pixels move faster along the edges of the brush than
in the placid center, much like a real hurricane. Adobe
gave the Twirl Counterclockwise tool the pink slip.
Now to twirl the other way, press the Alt (Option on
the Mac) key as you drag or press the mouse button.
Try this technique with the other tools I describe here (with some tools
the effect is more obvious than with others). Simply click and press the
mouse button. The longer you press the mouse
button, the more prominent the effect becomes.
 Pucker (S): This tool is the equivalent of the Pinch
filter, squishing pixels toward the center of the
area covered by the brush as you press the mouse
button or drag. To reverse the pucker direction,
which essentially applies a bloat, press the Alt
(Option on the Mac) key as you press the mouse
button or drag.
 Bloat (B): Here we have an analog to the Spherize
filter, pushing pixels toward the edge of the brush
area as you press the mouse button or drag the
mouse. To reverse the bloat direction — doing so
applies a pucker — press the Alt (Option on the Mac)
key as you press the mouse button or drag.
 Push Left (O): Formerly known as the Shift Pixels tool,
this odd tool moves pixels to the left when you drag
the tool straight up. Drag down to move pixels to the
right. Drag clockwise to increase the size of the object
being distorted. Drag counterclockwise to decrease
the size. To reverse any of the directions, press the Alt
(Option on the Mac) key as you press the mouse
button or drag.
 Mirror (M): Formerly known as the Reflect tool, the
Mirror tool drags a reversed image of your pixels at a
90-degree angle to the motion of the brush. Press the
Alt key (Option key on the Mac) to force the reflection
in the direction opposite the motion of the brush (for
example, to the left of a brush moving right, or above
a brush moving down). This tool is a good choice for
producing shimmery reflections.

 Turbulence (T): This tool adds a random jumbling
effect to your pixels. You can use the Turbulence tool
to re-create maelstroms of air, fire, and water with
(well, yeah) clouds, flames, and waves.
The other tools
The remaining tools on the palette perform different func-
tions. Continuing down the Liquify Tools palette (refer to
Figure 3-1), these tools are (shown here with their keyboard shortcuts):
 Reconstruct (R): This tool lets you reverse or alter — completely or
partially — the distortions you’ve made. You can retrace your steps if
you went overboard in your warping activities.
 Freeze Mask (F): Use this tool to protect areas from changes. It paints
the frozen area with a red overlay, just like Quick Mask mode.
 Thaw Mask (D): This tool unprotects areas by erasing the red protec-
tive “freeze” tone. This is a lot like erasing areas you’ve painted in Quick
Mask mode.
 Hand (H): The Hand tool works exactly like the standard Photoshop
Hand tool. Click and push the image to move it around within the Preview
window. You find more about the Hand tool in Book I, Chapter 4.
 Zoom (Z): The Zoom tool works exactly like the standard Photoshop
Zoom tool. Indeed, you can also zoom in and out by using the +Ctrl+click
(+Ô+click on the Mac) and Alt+Ctrl+click (Option+Ô+click on the Mac)
shortcuts to zoom in and out. See Book I, Chapter 4, for more on using
the regulation Zoom tool.
Separate from the Liquify Tools palette and in the lower-left corner of the
Liquify window is a magnification box with a pop-up menu that you can use
to select magnifications from 6 percent to 1600 percent. Or if you like but-
tons, click your way to magnification by using the +/- zoom control buttons.
The Options Areas
At the right side of the Liquify window (refer to Figure 3-1) are some menus
and buttons that let you specify options for the tools, for reconstructing
and freezing, and for viewing. I point them all out to you here, and cover
exactly how to use them later in this chapter.

The Options Areas
559
 Load Mesh and Save Mesh: Liquify lets you show or hide a criss-cross
area called a mesh, shown in Figure 3-2. The mesh provides a visual map
of the distortions you’ve applied. The mesh starts out as a square grid
and changes as you apply distortions. The mesh lets you clearly see
exactly what you’ve done to the image, and, even better, provides a way
to save those distortions on your hard drive so you can load and reap-
ply them to the same (or a different) image later.
 Tool Options: You can use the Tool Options area to apply parameters to
the painting tools. You can specify the following options:
• Brush Size: Specifies the width of the brush.
• Brush Density: Specifies how fast the brush effect levels off at its
edges. For example, with a feathered brush, the effect is stronger in
the center and lighter at the edges.
• Brush Pressure: Specifies the speed at which you distort as you
drag. Lower is slower.
• Brush Rate: Specifies the speed at which you distort as you keep a
tool stationary, such as the Twirl tool. Again, lower is slower.
• Turbulent Jitter: Determines how tightly the brush jumbles pixels.
This option gives the stroke a more natural, organic look.

The Options Areas
560
When you select the Reconstruct tool, you can also choose a Reconstruct
Mode from the pop-up menu. (I explain each of these modes later in the
chapter.)
If you have a pressure-sensitive stylus tablet, you can also choose to
use the amount of pressure you apply to control the width of your
brush stroke.
 Reconstruct Options: Here, you can select one of several reconstruct
modes. Reconstruct and Restore All buttons let you reverse all changes
made on unfrozen areas (a little at a time) or revert to your last set of
distortions. I show you how to use these, too.
 Mask Options: Consider freezing and masking one and the same when
you’re immersed in the Liquify dialog box. The mask options let you
freeze areas from existing selections, layer masks, transparent areas,
or alpha channels in your image. You can also invert the frozen area
(thawing frozen portions of the image, and freezing the previously
thawed areas), and thaw all the areas that were frozen with one click.
Here is the lowdown on the options, each of which is indicated by a
double-circle icon:
• Replace Selection: Allows you to freeze or mask areas of your image
based on an existing selection, transparent area, layer mask, or
alpha channel. (For more on layer masks and alpha channels, see
Book VI, Chapters 1 and 3.)
• Add to Selection: Displays the mask in the image and then enables
you to add to the frozen areas with the Freeze tool. Adds pixels to
the currently frozen areas.
• Subtract from Selection: Subtracts pixels from the currently frozen
areas.
• Intersect with Selection: Masks only those pixels that are selected
and currently frozen.
• Invert Selection: Inverts selected pixels and currently frozen areas.
Click None to remove frozen areas. Click Mask All to freeze the
entire image. Click Invert All to exchange frozen and thawed areas.
 View Options: You can show or hide frozen (masked) areas, the mesh,
or the image. Also, if you choose the Show Mesh option, you can
choose the mesh size and color. If you select the Show Mask option, you
can select the color that indicates frozen areas. For example, if your
image contains lots of red, you may want to change the freeze color to
blue to create more contrast.

Finally, you can also apply a backdrop that shows how the image being liq-
uefied will appear when merged with other layers. To view your distorted
image along with other layers, select the Show Backdrop option, and then
select the particular layer you want to view, or choose All Layers from the
Use pop-up menu. You can now choose whether you want the backdrop in
front, behind, or blended with the distorted image. Specify an opacity per-
centage for the displayed layers so they won’t obliterate the image being
distorted. The default (50 percent) allows you to see both well, allowing you
to keep track of your distortions.
Transforming an Image
Liquify seems impossibly complex on the surface, but it’s as easy to apply
as fingerpaint after you play with it a little. Here’s a step-by-step scenario of
the things you might do to apply some distortion to your own image:
1. Select and open an image you want to transmogrify with Liquify;
select a layer.
2. If you don’t want to distort the whole layer, you can make your
desired selection.
You can also use a layer mask, alpha channel, or transparent area to
define what portions you want to distort.
3. Choose Filter➪Liquify or press Shift+Ctrl+X (Shift+Ô+X on the Mac).
The Liquify dialog box appears.
4. If applicable, load your selection, layer mask, transparent area, or
alpha channel in the Mask Options area.
Make sure you select the Show Mask option in the View Options area.
5. You can also select the Freeze Mask tool and paint over the areas that
you want to mask or protect.
After you freeze an area, you may want to get rid of the freeze highlight-
ing for a while. Deselect the Show Mask option in View Options to turn
the display on or off.
6. In the View Options area, make sure that the Show Mesh and Show
Image options are both selected.
You can hide any or all of these at any time to get a different view of
your image. For example, you might want to hide the frozen areas and
mesh to view only your image with the distortions you’ve applied so far.
Or perhaps you might want to look only at the mesh, as shown in
Book VII
Chapter 3
Distorting with the
Liquify Command

Transforming an Image
562
Figure 3-3, to get a look at the distortions by themselves. Being able to
examine the liquification process in several different ways is one reason
that Liquify is so controllable.
7. If you’re having trouble seeing the mesh (or think the mask color will
blend in with a dominant color in your image), use the View options
to change the size and color of the mesh and the hue of the mask.
If you want to see your image distortions against a backdrop, you can
select that option as well.
8. Use the painting tools to apply various effects to your image, as
shown in Figure 3-4.
Remember to adjust the brush size and pressure to get the exact cover-
age you want.
At various points while you work, you may decide you want to freeze
parts of the image from further changes (either temporarily or 
permanently).
Figure 3-3: You can choose to view just the mesh if you want a good look at how the actual
distortions are mapped.

Transforming an Image
563
Figure 3-4: Use the various Painting tools to apply your desired distortions.
9. If you decide you want to work on an area again, select the Show
Mask option to display the frozen areas again (if necessary). Then
select the Thaw Mask tool and erase all or part of the freeze.
10. Use the Reconstruct tool or options to partially or fully reverse or
modify your distortions.
If you want to start over, click Restore All to get back to your original
image. All option settings stay as is. Press the Alt key (Option on the
Mac) and click Reset to revert back to your original image and reset all
options to their default settings.
11. When you finish, save the mesh you created by clicking Save Mesh.
Give the mesh a name and store it on your hard drive.
This step is totally optional, but saving your work is a good idea if you
really like what you’ve done.
12. Apply the distortion to your image by clicking OK and exiting the
Liquify dialog box.

Mastering Freezing and Thawing
564
Mastering Freezing and Thawing
Liquify’s ability to protect areas by freezing, and unprotect areas by thaw-
ing, deserves a closer look. Consider freezing the equivalent to masking.
Here’s a summary of the things you need to know:
 The easiest way to freeze/unfreeze is to use
the Freeze Mask and Thaw Mask tools to
paint the areas you want to protect or
unprotect, as shown in Figure 3-5. Use the
brush controls to modify how either tool
paints or erases. When you set brush pres-
sure to less than 100 percent, the opacity of
the mask you’re painting determines how
frozen that area is. For example, if an area is
only 25 percent frozen, using a tool on that
area produces only one-quarter the distortion
you get in an area that’s completely thawed.
 You can use active or saved selections to
define a frozen or masked area. This is a
great capability; you can use all the selection
tools in Photoshop to define frozen/ unfrozen
areas before you invoke Liquify. You could,
for example, select a portion of your image
by using the Magic Wand or Quick Selection
tool, another portion using selection marquees or Quick Mask mode,
and then save them all (choose Selection➪Save Selection) as alpha
channels. Then, when you use Liquify, choose any of those selections to
freeze an area.
 Choose the basis to use for your mask from the pop-up menu of the
Replace Selection command (far left icon under Mask Options).
You can also choose a layer mask to define your mask. This is a great
way to apply your distortions at varying degrees of intensity. Where the
mask reveals more, the distortion is more prominent. Where the mask
hides more, the distortion is subtler.
 To thaw all frozen areas, click the None button in the Mask
Options area.
 To freeze all thawed areas, click the Mask All button in the Mask
Options area.
 To reverse your frozen/unfrozen areas, click the Invert All button.
That which was frozen is thawed, and that which was unfrozen is
frozen. Amen!

Extending and Cloning Distortions
565
Reconstructing an Image
One of the most powerful capabilities of Liquify is that it can reconstruct
your image fully or partially — restoring some or all of the image to its pre-
Liquify state. This capability gives you a great deal of control over exactly
how Photoshop transforms your image; you can backtrack any part of the
transformation exactly the way you want. Here are some of your options:
 To cancel all the changes made on your image (say, you really, really
messed up), click the Restore All button in the Reconstruct Options
area. The image returns to its original state (as it was when you first
opened the Liquify window) and removes distortions in both frozen and
unfrozen areas.
 To change only unfrozen areas of your image to their original states,
select the Revert mode in the Reconstruct Options area of the dialog
box, and then click the Reconstruct button. The frozen areas remain
distorted, but everything else returns to normal.
Use this option when you’re displeased with some sections but like the
distortions in others. Freeze the stuff you like, and let Liquify cancel the
changes elsewhere.
 To paint portions of your image back to normalcy, choose Revert
mode in the Tool Options area, and then select the Reconstruct tool
from the Liquify Tools palette. You can use the Reconstruct tool to
restore the areas that you paint. The image reverts more quickly at the
center of the brush, so you have an extremely fine degree of control in
how you revert your image. The mesh may help you see exactly what
portions are being restored, too.
 You can also click the Reconstruct button to have Photoshop apply an
overall reconstruction. Click the button and Photoshop reconstructs
once. Click again to remove even more distortion.
If you don’t necessarily want to reconstruct your image back to its origi-
nal condition, but rather want to alter, extend, or clone your distortions,
you can choose Reconstruct modes other than Revert. See the next sec-
tion on the other Reconstruct modes.
Extending and Cloning Distortions
Liquify allows you to extend distortions you’ve made in frozen areas into
parts of the image that are unfrozen. If you have an image that has the requi-
site frozen and unfrozen portions, you should first choose a mode — which
determines specific ways in which Photoshop extends the image from the
frozen areas into the unfrozen area.

Reconstruct modes
The Reconstruct modes include the following four:
 Rigid: This mode keeps rigid right angles in the mesh’s grid, which can
generate some mismatches (Adobe calls those discontinuities) at the
edges where the frozen and unfrozen portions meet. This mode restores
unfrozen areas to close approximations of their original states.
 Stiff: Adobe describes this as a weak magnetic field, attracting the edges
between the frozen and unfrozen areas strongly where they meet, and
producing less distortion in unfrozen areas farther away from the edges.
 Smooth: This mode smoothly spreads the frozen areas’ distortions
through the unfrozen areas. It produces a smooth blending effect, as
shown in Figure 3-6.
 Loose: This mode generates an even smoother blending effect between
frozen and unfrozen areas.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 3-6: The Smooth mode smoothly blends frozen distortions into unfrozen areas.

Extending and Cloning Distortions
567
Use the Reconstruct tool to expand the frozen-area distortions into the
unfrozen area, using the mode you’ve selected to blend the pixels as you
paint. You can drag to paint, or click and Shift+click to paint in straight lines
(much as you do with Photoshop’s regular Brush tools).
More Reconstruct modes
There are three more Reconstruct modes that work slightly differently from
the previous four. These modes more or less clone particular distortions
you’ve already applied elsewhere in the image. Like the Clone Stamp tool,
these modes allow you to select part of the distortion and apply (or clone)
copies of the selection to other parts of your image:
 Displace: Displace copies the amount of displacement at the starting
point of the distortion to unfrozen parts of your image. You can use this
mode to displace parts of your image to a different position in the
image.
 Amplitwist: Amplitwist applies the displacement, scaling (sizing up or
down), and rotation of the distortion to unfrozen areas to match those
that exist at the starting point.
 Affine: Affine does much the same thing as Amplitwist, using displace-
ment, scaling, rotation, and skew in the distortion to modify unfrozen
areas to match those distortions that exist at the starting point.
Each time you click the mouse button, you create a new starting point, so if
you are trying to extend a distortion effect from a single starting point, don’t
release your mouse button until you’re done using the Reconstruct tool.
Using Displace, Amplitwist, and Affine
All three of these Reconstruct modes use different combinations of distor-
tion factors — such as displacement, scaling, rotation, or skew. Unlike the
other modes, the Reconstruct button isn’t available for these three.
You can use these modes only with the Reconstruct tool.
To use Displace, Amplitwist, or Affine, follow these steps:
1. Open an image to work on, and choose Filter➪Liquify.
2. Choose one of the three modes — Displace, Amplitwist, or Affine —
from the Reconstruct Mode pop-up menu in the Tool Options area.
3. Choose the Reconstruct tool.

5. Drag with the mouse in the unfrozen areas to apply that distortion.
6. To change the origin of the distortions being copied, click again any-

resume dragging in unfrozen areas. 
Your image takes on a distorted appearance like the one shown in

lthough taking the perfect photo is a
great goal, it’s one that is often just beyond
our reach. Not to worry though, if you’re a
Photoshop owner. In this book, you ﬁnd out what
you need to know about correcting color in all its
permutations — contrast, saturation, replacing,
remapping, and so on. You ﬁnd details on using
the focus and toning tools to manually adjust the
tones, textures, and colors in your images. I also
give you details on how you can give your images
a digital spa day with the two Healing Brushes and
the Patch and Red Eye tools. You learn how to
remove blemishes, wrinkles, and every other one
of nature’s imperfections. After you master these
techniques, you’ll be on your way to doing your
own digital extreme makeovers. But whatever you
do, don’t leave this book without checking out the
Vanishing Point feature. This single command
alone may be well worth the money you plunked
down for Photoshop.

P
hotoshop can provide magical transformations to images, making
them unrecognizable from the original, but sometimes what you really
want is simply to make an image look the same as the original — only better.
Perhaps the colors are a little too warm, or the shadows a bit inky, but you
don’t want an image that looks more processed than a freeze-
dried floral arrangement. You’d be happy to have everyone
admire your image without a clue that you’ve made
major corrections in Photoshop.
Welcome to the world of image enhancements.
This chapter concentrates on the things you can
do to correct color, contrast, hue, and color satu-
ration. After you master the basic tools, you’ll
want to explore some even more sophisticated
things you can do by using features such as
Photoshop’s Adjustment Layers (in Book V,
Chapter 1), which let you dynamically apply your
changes in remarkably flexible ways. But before you
dive into image adjustments, you’ll want to make sure
and remove any flaws, such as dust, scratches, blemishes,
and other nasty items, from your image. Check out Book VIII,
Chapter 3 to find out about fixing imperfections.
Introducing the Histogram Palette
One of the first things you want to do before you make any color or tonal
adjustments to your image is to take a good look at the quality and distribu-
tion of the tones throughout your image. I don’t mean just eyeballing the

Introducing the Histogram Palette
572
composite image on your screen. I’m talking about getting inside your image
and looking at its guts with the Histogram palette — and keeping it on-
screen so you can see its constant feedback on your image adjustments.
A histogram displays the tonal range
(also referred to as the key type) of an
image, as shown in Figure 1-1. It shows
how the pixels are distributed by graph-
ing the number of pixels at each of the
256 brightness levels in an image.
On this graph, pixels with the same
brightness level are stacked in bars
along a vertical axis. The higher the
line from this axis, the greater the
number of pixels at that brightness
level. You can view the distribution for
each color channel separately or for
the composite image as a whole. 
From this graph, you can then deter-
mine whether the image contains
enough detail in the shadow, midtone,
and highlight areas. This information helps you determine what image
adjustments you may need to make. The following steps walk you through
the basics of using the palette and interpreting the information you find
there:
1. Choose Window➪Histogram to bring up this graphical wonder. 
By default, the histogram displays the tonal range of the whole image,
in the composite image’s color mode, such as RGB, CMYK, Grayscale,
and so on. For details on color modes, see Book II, Chapter 1.
2. Choose Compact View, Expanded View or All Channels View from the
Histogram palette pop-up menu:
Compact View, the default, displays only a histogram of the whole image
(or your chosen selection or channel) with no controls or statistics.
Expanded View shows a histogram with statistics and controls for
choosing and viewing the histogram of individual channels. This view
also has controls for refreshing the histogram to show uncached data,
and choosing a selected layer (on the Source pop-up menu). Refer to
Figure 1-1 to see this view.
Figure 1-1: The Histogram palette
displays how pixels are distributed at each
of the 256 brightness levels.

Introducing the Histogram Palette
573
All Channels View, shown in
Figure 1-2, displays all the options
of the Expanded View, plus shows
the individual histograms for
each color channel. You may also
choose to view your channels in
color.
3. Check the source shown in the
Source drop-down list, and
choose a different source if
needed.
For example, instead of seeing a
histogram for an entire image, you
can display the histogram of an
individual channel, alpha channel,
or spot channel. You can also
choose to focus on the selected
layer or an adjustment layer.
Just select the layer in the Layers
palette, and choose Selected Layer
or Adjustment Composite from the
Source drop-down list. 
For more on adjustment layers, see Book V, Chapter 1.
4. If the Cached Data Warning icon (triangle with exclamation mark)
appears in the upper-right corner of the histogram, click the Uncached
Refresh button just above the icon to see a histogram that reflects the
image’s current state.
The warning lets you know that Photoshop is reading the histogram
from cache instead of your image’s current state. Cache is a reserved,
high-speed section of your computer’s memory. The image cache allows
the histogram to display faster because it is calculating the histogram
based on a representative sampling of the pixels in your image. 
Unless it is really bogging down your workflow, I recommend viewing
your image’s histograms using uncached data.
5. With the Histogram palette displaying the controls and data you want
to check, examine the tonal range in the histogram. An image with
good tonal range displays pixels in all areas. An image with poor
tonal range has gaps in the histogram, as shown in Figure 1-3.
The rest of this chapter explains ways you can correct color problems
that you find.

Figure 1-2: The All Channels View displays
individual histograms for each color
channel, as well as the composite channel.

Figure 1-3: Images with poor tonal range have noticeable gaps in the histogram.
6. If you’re into numbers, check the statistics to evaluate your image
as well.
See the nearby sidebar for details
on interpreting these details.
Position your cursor within the
histogram to see statistics about a
specific value. Drag your cursor
within the histogram to see statis-
tics about a range of values
(Photoshop highlights the range). 
When you make adjustments based on
problems you see in the histogram, be
sure to select any Preview options in
the dialog boxes of your image adjust-
ments, such as Levels. That way, the
Histogram palette displays both the
original and adjusted histograms, as
shown in Figure 1-4.

Choosing Automatic Color Correctors
575
Choosing Automatic Color Correctors
Photoshop has three automatic correction tools that can, in many cases,
improve appearance with a simple click of a menu command: Auto Levels,
Auto Color, and Auto Contrast. The upside of these controls is their ease of
use: You don’t need to know much about levels, color balance, or contrast
to use the automatic correctors (that’s why they’re automatic). But you find
out more about each of these characteristics later in this chapter, when I
explain how to make adjustments manually.
The automatic controls’ ease of use also comes with a downside: None is
likely to do as good a job as you can do manually, and sometimes automatic
controls even do more harm than good. If you have an average image (one
that doesn’t require a great deal of correction), you can try them out to see
if they help, which I explain how to do in the following sections. If not, you’ll
want to apply the manual tools explained later in this chapter to produce
the exact look you want.
Book VIII
Chapter 1

Understanding the histogram statistics
The Histogram palette gives you all kinds of sta-
tistics about the pixels in your image. Some of
these statistics, such as Standard Deviation,
may be for those who live in the land of Calculus.
But you may be able to glean some useful infor-
mation from some of the other statistics that
can help you in your image-adjusting tasks.
Here’s a brief explanation of each statistic:
 Mean: Average intensity value 
 Standard Deviation: How much the intensity
values vary 
 Median: Middle value of the intensity value
range 
 Pixels: Total number of pixels used to rep-
resent the histogram
 Cache Level: The current level of image
cache used to calculate the histogram 
The next three statistics display a value only
when you position or drag your cursor in the
histogram. Each value corresponds only to the
portion of the histogram under your cursor.
 Level: Intensity level 
 Count: The total number of pixels corre-
sponding to that intensity level 
 Percentile: The number of cumulative pixels
(in percentages) at or below that level, from
0% (left) to 100% (right)

Choosing Automatic Color Correctors
576
Auto Levels
The Auto Levels command uses a bit of built-in Photoshop intelligence to
automatically apply the Levels command (discussed later in the chapter) to
your image.
Auto Levels works best with average images that could use a bit of tweaking
but have lots of detail in the highlights (brightest portions of an image that
contain detail), shadows (the darkest portions of an image that contain
detail), and midtones.
Auto Levels defines the very lightest and darkest pixels of each of the three
colors as white and black, respectively, and then arranges the midtone
pixels in between. Along the way, as it balances the tones in your image, the
command may reduce colorcasts or even introduce some. You can fine-tune
the color manually after Auto Levels has done its work.
To try out the Auto Levels command, just choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Auto Levels, or press Shift+Ctrl+L (Shift+Ô+L on the Mac).
Although Auto Levels can improve your contrast, it may also produce an
unwanted colorcast (a slight trace of color). If this happens, cancel the com-
mand and try the Auto Contrast command. If that still doesn’t improve the
contrast, try the Levels command instead. And even better, try your Levels
adjustment on an adjustment layer. If it doesn’t work, you can always delete
it. No harm, no muss. For more on adjustment layers, see Book V, Chapter 1.
Auto Color
The Auto Color command adjusts both the color and contrast of an image,
based on the shadows, midtones, and highlights it finds in the image.
You usually use this command to remove a colorcast (or bias) or balance
the color in your image. Sometimes using Auto Color can be helpful in cor-
recting oversaturated or undersaturated colors as well. You can access the
command by choosing Image➪Adjustments➪Auto Color, or by pressing
Shift+Ctrl+B (Shift+Ô+B on the Mac).
Although Auto Color can do a good job on its own, you can customize the
parameters it uses to make its color corrections in the Auto Color Corrections
Options dialog box, which I discuss in “Setting Auto Color Correction Options,”
next in this chapter. See Figure 1-5 to see an image corrected using Auto
Levels and Auto Color.
Auto Contrast
Like its manually operated cousin, the Brightness/Contrast command, the
Auto Contrast command fiddles with the overall contrast and colors (if you’re
working with a color image) in an image, rather than making adjustments to
each color individually. Auto Contrast converts the lightest and darkest

Setting Auto Color Correction Options
577
pixels to white and black, respectively, making all highlights in the image
lighter and all shadows darker without changing the color values. This com-
mand may not do as good a job at improving contrast, but it retains the
color balance of an image and doesn’t cause any nasty colorcasts. 
Try using this command on hazy images. If you find it overdoes the adjust-
ment, try choosing Edit➪Fade and bringing down the Opacity level to blend
the adjusted image with your original image. For more on using the Fade
command, see Book VII, Chapter 1.
To use Auto Contrast, choose Image➪Adjustments➪Auto Contrast, or press
Alt+Shift+Ctrl+L (Option+Shift+Ô+L on the Mac).
Figure 1-5: Using Auto Levels and Auto Color quickly improved the contrast and colors of this
snapshot.
Setting Auto Color Correction Options
You can use the Auto Color Correction Options dialog box to tweak exactly
how Photoshop applies its Auto Levels, Auto Color, and Auto Contrast con-
trols, as well as for the manually operated Levels and Curves commands.
You can apply the settings only to a particular image-editing session, or save
the settings as defaults for all your Photoshop work.
Click the Options button in either the Levels or Curves dialog boxes on the
Image➪Adjustments menu. The options available in the Auto Color
Correction dialog box are on the advanced side, and this set of tools is best
used if you already understand manual color and contrast corrections.
You’ll want to brush up on your color theory, too, in Book II, Chapter 3.

Setting Auto Color Correction Options
578
To customize the automatic options, follow these steps:
1. Open an image and choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels or Ctrl+L (or
Ô+L on the Mac).
You can also use the Curves command by pressing Ctrl+M (or Ô+M on
the Mac).
2. Click the Options button in the
dialog box to access the Auto
Color Correction Options dialog
box, shown in Figure 1-6.
3. In the algorithm area, click the
method you want Photoshop to
use to adjust the tones. Your
choices include
• Enhance Monochromatic
Contrast: This option applies
the same changes to the Red,
Green, and Blue channels,
making brighter areas appear
lighter and shadow areas appear
darker, with no changes made to
the colors. (This is the method used by the Auto Contrast command.)
• Enhance Per Channel Contrast: This option individually adjusts the
red, green, and blue colors so that each has its own best balance of
light and dark tones, even if the color balance changes a bit. (This is
the algorithm used by the Auto Levels command.)
• Find Dark & Light Colors: This option locates the average
lightest and darkest pixels, and uses their values to maximize
the contrast of the image. (This is the algorithm used by the Auto
Color command.)
4. Select the Snap Neutral Midtones check box if you want Photoshop to
base its gamma, or midtone, correction values around a neutral color
located in the image.
The Auto Color command uses this option. 
5. In the Target Colors & Clipping area, enter a value in each of the clip
text entry boxes.
Setting clipping values between 0.5 and 1% eliminates the too-dark and
too-light pixels.
Figure 1-6: Once you know the basics,
customize the auto correction options.

Using Simple Color Correctors
579
These values adjust the amount of black and white pixels that Photoshop
removes from the darkest and lightest areas of the image. This option is
useful because every image includes some very dark pixels that contain
no real image information, as well as some very light pixels that are
completely washed out. Factoring in these two kinds of pixels when you
adjust tonal values is a waste. By setting the clipping values at 0.5 to 1%,
you leave these no-good pixels out of the picture, so to speak.
6. Click the Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights swatch.
The Color Picker appears, allowing you to set a preferred value for the
darkest, medium, and lightest areas.
7. Select the Eyedropper tool from the Tools palette.
8. Move your mouse over the image and locate the dark, middle, or light
tone you want to use. Click it when you find it.
9. Click OK to exit the Color Picker. Repeat Steps 6 through 8 for each of
the three colors you want to change.
As you move the mouse over the image, the values in the Info palette
change, helping you pick the shadow, midtone, or highlight area you want. 
10. Back in the Auto Color Corrections dialog box, select the Save as
Defaults option to store the settings you just made for subsequent use
in any Photoshop session. 
If you don’t select the option, Photoshop applies the changes you made
only to the current session.
11. Click OK to exit the Auto Color Correction Options dialog box.
Your options are now customized.
Using Simple Color Correctors
Photoshop has several simple manual tools you can use to fix color in ways
that are different from the Auto Levels, Auto Contrast, and Auto Color com-
mands. They are the Brightness/Contrast control, Color Balance, Desaturate
command, and the ever-popular Variations tool. In the following sections,
you find out when to use (and when not to use) each of them.
Applying Brightness/Contrast
Beginners gravitate to the Brightness/Contrast control because it seems so
intuitive to use. If your image is too dark, move a slider to make it lighter; if
it’s too light, move the same slider to make it darker. Right? You can fix an
image that’s overly contrasty or overly flat-looking the same way. Right?

Maybe.
I say maybe and not flat out No,
because in Version CS3, Adobe has
improved the command, as demon-
strated in Figure 1-7. Rather than
applying all its adjustments equally to
all areas of your image (whether they
need it or not), it now applies adjust-
ments proportionately to your image,
like the Levels and Curves adjustments
do. Just steer clear of the Use Legacy
option which will revert the Brightness
and Contrast command back to its pre-
CS3 algorithm, thereby turning your
image into a mess.
Even though Adobe has improved the
Brightness and Contrast command,
you’re better off using Levels and
Curves, which can tailor your image
enhancements to the exact portions of
the image you want to work with.
Tweaking with the Color
Balance controls
With an understanding of color theory (which I explain in Book II,
Chapter 3), you can probably use the Color Balance controls to make
some simple changes to the color in your image. The difficult part is in rec-
ognizing exactly which color you need to add or subtract from your image
in the first place.
Colors are subtler than you might think. For example, a slight colorcast
toward cyan can look a lot like a slightly green or blue colorcast. Is your
image too red, or does it have too much magenta?
Use the Variations command that I describe in the following section to
figure out how to tell the various colorcasts apart. The Variations command
displays each of the different types of colorcasts in an array so you can
compare them.
Figure 1-7: The Brightness and Contrast
command areas attempts to improve tonal
values in your image.

Using Simple Color Correctors
581
To use the Color Balance controls, follow these steps:
1. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Color Balance, or press Ctrl+B (Ô+B on
the Mac) to access the Color Balance dialog box.
2. Choose the Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights option to select the
tones of an image you want to work on.
Usually, Midtones is the best choice, unless your image has a colorcast
in the shadows or highlights that doesn’t affect the overall image.
That can sometimes happen when a subject is close to a colored wall
or other object that reflects light onto, say, the shadowed side of a 
subject.
3. Select the Preserve Luminosity option. 
When selected, Photoshop modi-
fies the colors of the image, but
the brightness and contrast of the
tones stay the same. If you’re not
happy with the results, uncheck
the option.
4. Move the Cyan/Red, Magenta/
Green, or Yellow/Blue sliders to
add or subtract color, watching
the effects of your adjustments on
the original image.
The Color Levels boxes show the
amount of each color that
Photoshop adds and subtracts.
Figure 1-8 shows an example of
subtracting yellow and green to
improve the color in an image.
The colors are arranged by their
opposites on the color wheel.
Dragging the slider toward Cyan
adds cyan to the image and 
subtracts its complement, red.
Dragging toward Green adds green
to the image and subtracts
magenta.

Fixing Lighting with Shadow/Highlight

Fixing Lighting with Shadow/Highlight
The Shadow/Highlight adjustment is a great feature that offers a quick and
easy method of correcting over- and underexposed areas in your image.
This command works well with subjects photographed with the light source
coming from behind (backlit) and consequently have a dark foreground.
The adjustment is also helpful for bringing out the detail in harsh shadow
areas in subjects shot in bright, overhead light, as shown in Figure 1-9. 
Figure 1-9: The Shadow/Highlight adjustment is a quick way to correct the lighting in your images.

Resisting the urge to go nuts with sliders
If you’re like me, you like clicking options,
adjusting values, and sliding sliders back and
forth. Thankfully, Photoshop is happy to oblige
you with options to make you feel so powerful
that you can take on any project. 
Was that a sinister laugh I heard? Easy there, part-
ner. I’m about to tell you something that will break
your heart at first, but which you’ll thank me for
later: Always pick a single slider and stick with it
when you’re trying to compensate for any color-
cast. Moving two sliders is a waste because you
can accomplish anything you want with just one. 
For example, if you move both the Cyan/Red and
Magenta/Green sliders an equal amount to the
left (adding cyan and magenta), you’re actually
just adding blue. Moving three sliders is even
worse because, depending on the amount and
direction of movement, the three are likely to at
least partially cancel each other out or multiply
the effects. However, if a cast is just in one area,
such as the shadows, and a different colorcast
in another area, it may be useful to do more than
one adjustment.

Fixing Lighting with Shadow/Highlight
583
To familiarize yourself with this tool, follow these steps:
1. Open an image in dire need of repair and choose
Image➪Adjustments➪Shadow/Highlight. Note that you can now adjust
CMYK images, as well as RGB.
When the dialog box appears, the correction is automatically applied in
your preview. If you don’t see any change, make sure you’ve selected
the Preview check box. The default settings in the dialog box are meant
to correct backlit images, so they may or may not do the right correc-
tion job for you as they are set.
2. Move the Amount slider to adjust the amount of correction for your
Shadows and/or your Highlights. 
The higher the percentage, the lighter the shadows and the darker the
highlights. You can also enter a value in the percentage text box. 
3. If you’re happy with the results,
you can click OK and be done with
the adjustment. However, if you
crave more control, click the Show
More Options check box at the
bottom of the dialog box.
A whole array of sliders magically
appears, as shown in Figure 1-10.
4. Drag the Tonal Width slider to
increase or decrease the range of
tones adjusted in the shadows or
highlights.
The lower the percentage, the nar-
rower the range of tones that are
affected. For example, by using a
very low percentage, only the 
darkest parts of the shadow or the
lightest parts of the highlight are 
corrected. A higher percentage
includes a wide range of tones,
including midtone areas. The appro-
priate percentage to use varies
among images, so start with the
default setting of 50% and work in
small increments from there. 
If, when lightening the shadow areas, you find the midtones and high-
lights getting too light as well, reduce the Tonal Width percentage of the
Shadows. But if you start seeing artifacts, you have set the percentage
too high.

Figure 1-10: The Shadow and Highlight
dialog box offers controls for adjusting the
amount of correction in your shadow,
midtone, and highlight areas.

Adjusting Exposure
584
5. Drag the Radius slider to increase or decrease the number of pixels
used in the local neighborhood.
To fix lighting, this command lightens or darkens pixels according to
the luminance (brightness) of the surrounding pixels, technically called
a local neighborhood. The best local neighborhood size depends on the
particular image, so play with this slider and view the results. If the
Radius is too small, your main subject may lack contrast. Conversely, if
it’s too large, your background may be overly bright or dark. Adobe rec-
ommends setting the radius to approximately half the size of the main
subject in your image. So if your subject takes up roughly 600 pixels,
then set your radius to 300 pixels. Choose View➪Show Rulers and set
your Units to pixels in your Preferences. 
6. Make additional changes in the Adjustments area as needed: 
• Color Correction: Available for color images only, this control
enables you to correct the colors in only the adjusted portions of
your image. Often when you increase or decrease the Amount of
Shadows or Highlights, you bring out the “hidden” colors. Generally,
higher Color Correction values make colors more saturated,
whereas lower values make colors more desaturated. 
• Brightness: Available for grayscale images only. Move the slider left
to darken and right to lighten. 
• Midtone Contrast: Move the slider left to reduce contrast and right
to increase contrast. Just be aware that when you increase the
Midtone Contrast, you may also undesirably darken shadow areas
and lighten highlight areas.
• Black Clip/White Clip: As I explain in “Setting Auto Color Correction
Options” earlier in this chapter, setting clipping values between 0.5
and 1% eliminates the too-dark and too-light pixels.
7. Click the Save As Defaults button to save and make your settings the
defaults. 
If you want to reset the setting back to the original defaults, press Shift
and click the Save As Defaults button. You can save as many settings as
you want. Click the Load button to reload a particular setting.
8. Click OK to apply the adjustment and exit the dialog box.
Adjusting Exposure
This Exposure adjustment is primarily meant to correct tonal values of High
Dynamic Range (HDR) images, which are 32-bit. (In layman’s terms, the bits
indicate how much information is stored about the color. The more bits, the
better the color.) But you can apply Exposure adjustments to 16-bit or even
8-bit images as well. This command works by using a linear color space,
also know as gamma 1.0, rather than your image’s color space, to make

Adjusting Exposure
585
tonal adjustments. Figure 1-11 shows an example of an image helped by
this adjustment.
Figure 1-11: Fix tonal values with the new Exposure adjustment.
If you use the Exposure adjustment with 16-bit or 8-bit images, the slider’s
adjustments may be too drastic. Try pressing the Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) key
over the number field and dragging to access the scrubby sliders, which
offers a less dramatic adjustment as you slide the control. Also keep an eye
on your images. The Exposure adjustment sometimes clips, or loses, data on
lower bit images.
To apply the Exposure adjustment, follow these steps:
1. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Exposure.
2. Adjust any of the following:
• Exposure: This option adjusts mainly the highlights and pretty much
ignores the darkest shadows.
• Offset: This option darkens the shadow and midtone values and
leaves the highlights alone.
• Gamma Correction: This option adjusts the image’s gamma, or mid-
tone, values.

3. Use the Eyedroppers to adjust the luminance, or brightness, values in
the image. Note that this is different from Levels where the eyedrop-
pers adjust all the color channels:
• Set Black Point Eyedropper: Sets the Offset. The pixel you click
becomes the black point.
• Set White Point Eyedropper: Sets the Exposure. The pixel you click
becomes the white point.
• Midtone Eyedropper: Sets the Exposure. The pixel you click
becomes the middle gray value. 
4. Click the Save button to save the settings to apply later by clicking
the Load button.
Correcting Colorcast with Variations
Photoshop’s Variations feature is a variation (so to speak) on the profes-
sional photographer’s ring around (a set of color prints, each made with
slightly different color balance) or test strip (a single print of an image made
so that each section is shown using a different color balance). Both tools let
you view several renditions of an image and choose the best one visually
by comparing them. You might want to use Variations when you’re unsure
about exactly how the color is biased, and you want to compare several ver-
sions of an image to see exactly what the colorcast is.
Although not as sophisticated as some color correction techniques, the
Variations feature has the advantage of being quick and simple, and it 
doesn’t require a lot of training to use. 
The Putting-It-Together project that follows walks you through the steps in
using the Variations dialog box.
Putting It Together
Correcting Tinted, Faded Photos
In this Putting-It-Together project, I employ the Variations feature to restore the color in a
scan of a color print originally made in 1965. Unfortunately, the years have not been kind
to this photo; it has a slight, but annoying, greenish tinge that’s a result of the magenta
dye layer of the print fading. As the magenta fades, the other two color layers, cyan
(blue) and yellow, appear proportionately stronger when compared to the magenta that
remains and, as you may recall, cyan and yellow make green.

I plan to use the Variations feature of Photoshop to restore the magenta layer in this
photo that’s green with age.
To correct colorcast in an old photograph by using the Photoshop Variations feature,
follow these steps:
1. In Photoshop, open an old, fading photo that needs color correction.
In this case, I’m using an old, faded, greenish-looking picture, shown in the figure,
but any colorcast works. 
2. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Variations from the menu bar.
The Variations dialog box appears.
3. Select the Show Clipping option to tell Photoshop to show any areas of the image
that will be “overwhelmed” by the correction you’re contemplating. That is, no
new information is added. 
4. If you want to use corrections you saved earlier, load those settings by clicking the
Load button. Otherwise, skip to the next step.
continued

Correcting Colorcast with Variations

5. Make adjustments with the Fine/Coarse slider. 
In my example, the greenish picture needs some magenta, so I dragged the
Fine/Coarse slider to the left. I wanted to have a smaller increment of change as I
adjust the color.
You can also click one of the tick marks to move the slider to that position.
Photoshop doesn’t allow setting the control to any of the intermediate positions
between the marks.
6. Make sure that you’ve selected the Midtones radio button, and then click the
Preview window containing the amount of color you want to add. 
Watch the Current Pick thumbnail, which reflects the correction.
In my case, I need to click the More Magenta image. 
Click several times if your initial application isn’t enough or click other Preview win-
dows to add other, additional colors.
Photoshop applies your corrections only to the middle tones of the image. In many
cases, that’s sufficient. However, sometimes shadows take on a particular hue, or
the highlights may gain colorcasts of their own.
7. Click the Highlights and/or Shadows radio buttons to add colors only to those parts
of the photo.
Variations isn’t the best tool to make complex color corrections, so be careful.
You might be able to see a highlight color in the shadows under the pillow, most
noticeable in the More Magenta preview. The highlight is the Clipping indicator
continued

showing that the change made by that Preview window is too much for that particu-
lar area of the picture. That is, Photoshop can’t add any more magenta to the high-
lighted area without losing detail in the image.
8. Click the Darker preview (in the lower-right corner of the dialog box) to make the
photo a little darker.
The Fine/Coarse slider has no effect on the amount of change Photoshop applies.
Instead, you can click the Lighter or Darker preview several times to achieve the
look you want.
In my case, only one click is necessary.
9. Click the Saturation radio button to brighten the colors, and use the Fine/Coarse
slider to control how much saturation you add or remove.
The Variations feature also lets you adjust the purity of color, or saturation, of the
colors in an image. Now only three previews appear: a less saturated version, the
current choice, and a more saturated version. My photo was washed out, or under-
saturated, so I clicked the More Saturation button.
10.To save your settings, click the Save button, apply a name to the settings, and store
them in the folder of your choice.
I recommend saving your settings, especially if you’re working on a copy of the orig-
inal image and want to apply the same corrections later, or if you plan to correct
several photos that have the same color defects. 

Washing Out Color with Desaturate
590
Washing Out Color with Desaturate
Sometimes, you don’t want any color at all. Photoshop’s Desaturate com-
mand can wash all the color out of a layer or selection. 
Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should. Use this 
command with caution because neither the Desaturate command nor
Photoshop’s Image➪Mode➪Grayscale command is the best technique for
converting a color image to monochrome. Simply removing the color can
produce an image that appears to be too low in contrast, which is another
kettle of fish altogether. See Book II, Chapter 2, and the section “Converting
to Black & White” in this chapter, for a better way to create grayscale images. 
However, if you simply want to eliminate the color from a layer or selection
image quickly, the Desaturate command does the job. To apply it, select the
area you want to operate on and choose Image➪Adjustments➪Desaturate,
or press Shift+Ctrl+U (Shift+Ô+U on the Mac).
Using the Saturation control in the Hue/Saturation command gives you
better control over the degree of desaturation you desire, while leaving
the image looking richer. I show you how to play with saturation using the
Hue/Saturation controls later in this chapter.
Working with Professional Color Correctors
The simple color correctors I discuss earlier in this chapter usually aren’t
enough to provide thorough color correction if you have a really problem-
atic image on your hands. Fortunately, Photoshop has the kind of profes-
sional tools needed to make sophisticated color corrections required for
higher end color printing. You don’t have to be a pro to use the Levels or
Curves commands, nor to work with the Hue/Saturation controls. But you’ll
feel like one after you master these powerful tools.
Leveling for better contrast
If you want to adjust tonal values of images (the brightness or darkness of
tones) or correct colors (the relationship between the colors), the Levels
command is the tool for you. It offers more control than the Auto Levels
command, which I discuss earlier in this chapter. The Levels command is
also a much more sophisticated tool than the Brightness/Contrast control
because you can work with individual tones, brightening or darkening indi-
vidual tones as you want, and you have a great deal more information to
help you make your choices. 

Working with Professional Color Correctors
591
Open the Levels dialog box, shown
in Figure 1-12, by pressing Ctrl+L 
(Ô+L on the Mac) or selecting Image➪
Adjustments➪Levels. The graph shown
in the center of the dialog box is a his-
togram, which I described in detail in
the first section of this chapter. You
can use the dialog box, histogram and
all, for evaluating and adjusting levels
in the following ways:
 Visually check the distribution of
dark, midtone, and light values. I
explain how to read histograms in
“Introducing the Histogram Palette”
at the beginning of this chapter.
 View separate histograms for each channel. The default histogram 
displays information for the entire image. To see the histogram of an
individual channel, choose it from the Channel pop-up menu. For an
RGB image, you can view the Red, Green, and Blue channels. For a
CMYK image you can view the Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black chan-
nels. You can view the histograms of each channel simultaneously by
using the Histogram palette.
 Adjust the black and white points based on the histogram. The three tri-
angles at the bottom of the histogram, in black, gray, and white, represent
the shadow on the left, midtone in the middle, and highlight on the right.
Even though they’re located where they are, many images have no black
tones at the far-left side of the scale, or no white tones at the far-right side. 
One of the simplest corrections you can do is to move the black and
white sliders so that they actually correspond to the pixels containing
dark and light tones. Simply slide the black triangle so that it corre-
sponds to the first true black pixels in the image (the beginning of the
histogram), and then move the white triangle to align it with the lightest
pixels (the end of the histogram). That ensures that Photoshop doesn’t
waste tones by allocating them to areas of the image that actually have
no image detail. See Figure 1-13 to see an example of an image that was
rescued by the use of the Levels adjustment.
 See exactly what happens when you use the Auto Levels command.
When you click the Auto button, which applies the same adjustments as
the Auto Levels command discussed earlier in this chapter, Photoshop
applies its own suggested changes, resetting the white point and the
black point, and redistributing the gray values of the pixels in between.
Afterward, the histogram shows that the pixels fill the complete range
from white to black.

Figure 1-13: Applying the Levels command to a dark photo dramatically improves the contrast.
Setting black and white points manually
For more control, you can use the Eyedropper tools in the Levels dialog box
to set the black and white points. Just follow these steps:
1. Open an image and choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels.
Make sure you have the Info palette open (Window➪Info), and display
the HSB and RGB color modes. (To do this, choose Palette Options from
the Info palette pop-up menu and choose HSB and RGB from the Color
Readout pop-up menus.) See Book II, Chapters 2 and 3 for more on
color modes.
Remember that you can also apply certain adjustments, such as
Levels, via an adjustment layer rather than directly to the image itself.
Adjustment layers provide more editing flexibility if you later decide
you need to tweak the adjustment. For more on adjustment layers, see
Book V, Chapter 1. 
2. Select the White Eyedropper tool and move it around the image
while watching the Info palette.
3. Look for the lightest white in the image, which may be anywhere
from 90 to 100%. Select that point by clicking.
4. Using the Black Eyedropper tool, repeat the process outlined in Steps
2 and 3 to select the darkest black in the image. 
The combination of these two choices redistributes the pixels from
pure white to pure black.
You can also reset the white and black points by moving the position
of the white and black triangles on the input sliders (just under the 
histogram). Or, you can enter numbers in the Input Levels boxes. The

Working with Professional Color Correctors
593
three boxes represent the black, gray, and white triangles, respectively.
Use the numbers 0 to 255 in the white and black boxes.
5. Use the Gray Eyedropper tool to remove any colorcasts. Select a neu-
tral gray portion of your image, one in which the Info palette shows
equal values of red, green, and blue.
Note that the Gray Eyedropper tool is not available when working on
grayscale images.
Although you generally make changes to the entire document by using
the RGB channel, you can apply changes to any one of an image’s com-
ponent color channels by selecting the specific channel with the
Channel drop-down menu at the top of the Levels dialog box (refer
to Figure 1-12). You can also make adjustments to just selected areas.
This can be helpful when one area of your image needs adjusting, while
others don’t. See Book III, Chapter 1 for details on making selections.
6. Adjust the output sliders at the very bottom of the Levels dialog box. 
Moving the black triangle to the right reduces the contrast in the shad-
ows and lightens the image. Moving the white triangle to the left
reduces the contrast in the highlights and darkens the image. 
7. Adjust the midtones with the gray triangle slider (it appears between
the black and white input sliders, just under the histogram). 
The values you’re adjusting are called the gamma values.
Dragging this triangle to the left lightens the midtones. Dragging it to the
right darkens the midtones while leaving the highlights and shadows
alone. You can also move the gray triangle by entering numbers from
9.99 to 0.1 in the center option box. The default value, 1.0, lies exactly in
the middle of the range.
If you’re working with a series of similar images (such as a bunch of
video captures), you can save the settings to reuse them later. 
8. Click the Save button to store your settings.
This step saves the settings, but doesn’t apply them. Just click the Load
button to retrieve them.
9. Click OK to apply your settings and exit the dialog box.
Adjusting curves for hard-to-correct photos
The Curves command is one of the most advanced Photoshop correction
tools available, offering sophisticated control over the brightness, contrast,
and midtone (gamma) levels in an image; I’m talking about control that is far

beyond that offered by the Levels and Brightness/Contrast dialog boxes.
This section introduces you to the functions of the Curves command, but
you’ll want to practice using it a great deal to gain the kind of experience
you need to work with it effectively.
Whereas the Brightness/Contrast dialog box lets you change an image glob-
ally, and the Levels command allows you to change the shadows, highlights,
and midtones separately, Curves goes far beyond either of those settings.
It lets you change pixel values at 16 (which includes start and end points)
different points along an image’s tonal range. You can work with the com-
bined Red, Green, and Blue color channels (or CMYK channels) or apply
your changes to the individual colors. Often images that just can’t be fixed
to your satisfaction with Levels can be helped with the Curves adjustment,
as shown in Figure 1-14.
Figure 1-14: The Curves adjustment offers more control and sophistication than many other
color correction tools.
Working with the Curves dialog box
You access the Curves dialog box by choosing Image➪Adjustment➪Curves
or by pressing Ctrl+M (Ô+M on the Mac). 

Working with Professional Color Correctors

Curves got a total makeover in Version
CS3 with the addition of several new
features, such as Presets and various
display options, such as a histogram
preview, as shown in Figure 1-15.
The following tips help you to begin
understanding how to interpret the
information and use the tools in this
dialog box:
 The horizontal axis maps the
brightness values as they are
before image correction (input). 
 The vertical axis maps the bright-
ness values after correction
(output). 
Each axis represents a continuum
of 256 levels, divided into four parts
by finely dotted lines. In the default
mode, the lower-left-hand corner
represents 0,0 (pure black) and the
upper-right-hand corner is 255,255
(pure white). By default, the dialog
box shows a 4 x 4 (quarter tone)
grid; Alt+click (Option+click on the
Mac) inside the grid to toggle it to a
10 x 10 (10% increment) grid. If you
have the Curve Display Options
visible, you can use the quarter tone or 10% increment display buttons.
 Whenever you open the Curves dialog box, the graph begins as a
straight line. Unless you make changes, the input is exactly the same as
the output, a direct 1:1 correlation.
 Expand the Curve Display Options and specify the following:
• Show Amount of: Choose between Light and Pigment to display the
brightness levels or percentages. To keep things simple, I would
leave them at the default of Light (levels), where darker values are
at the bottom left and lighter values are at the top right. Adjust your
gridlines in small or large increments.
• Show: If you are adjusting curves for individual channels, choose
Channel Overlays to superimpose those individual curves. Select
Baseline to show your original straight line curve. Choose to display
a histogram overlay. For more on histograms, see “Introducting the
Histogram Palette earlier in this chapter. Check Intersection Line to
display horizontal and vertical lines to help you align your points as
you drag them on the curve.

 When you use the Eyedropper tool from the Tools palette to click in the
image, a circle appears on the graph to show you the value of the pixel
being sampled. At the bottom of the Curves dialog box, you can read
the pixel’s input and output values.
 When you click the Auto button, the darkest pixels in the image (the deep
shadows) are reset to black and the lightest areas are set to white. As with
the Levels dialog box, this option is the easiest way to make a correction.
 The Curves dialog box has black, white, and gray Eyedropper tools you
can use to set the black, white, and midtone points, just as you can with
Levels.
 Select the Show Clipping options to have Photoshop display where clip-
ping occurs in the image during your corrections. Remember clipping
occurs when a pixel’s values are lighter or darker than the highest or
lowest value that can be displayed in the image, resulting in loss of
detail in those areas.
Adjusting curves
If you click at any point on the curve other than the endpoints, Photoshop
adds a control point that shows your position. You can remove a control
point by dragging it downward until it is completely off the graph, or by
dragging it on top of the next point up or down from it on the graph. You
can add up to 14 points to the curve.
Version CS3 has given us Curve presets, located at the very top of the Curves
dialog box. If you’re a Curves novice, trying one of these presets is a good way
to get your feet wet in understanding how curves work. Note that when you
select a preset, a curve is loaded into your dialog box. You can also use a
preset as a starting point and then tweak it further with your own adjustments.
Experiment with the curves to see how they affect the image. For example:
 Click the Auto button to have Photoshop analyze your image’s color
and tonal values and make an automatic adjustment. Again, you can use
this as a starting point and tweak from there.
 Flattening a curve lowers contrast.
 Making a curve steeper heightens contrast.
 Moving a curve downward (if the display is set to Light) darkens the
image. Moving it upward lightens.
 Again, if your display is set to Light, adjust your highlights by moving
points in the top right. Adjust shadows by adjusting points in the
bottom left. Adjust midtones by moving points in the center.
 A gently sloped S-shaped curve increases contrast, especially in the
highlight and shadow areas. Using a curve like this also helps to define
the midtones.

 For ultimate control, Photoshop lets you draw a curve with the precise
shape you’d like, creating an arbitrary curve or map. Click the Pencil
tool in the dialog box, and then draw peaks and valleys in the Curves
dialog box. Watch the changes in your original image.
 You can also add points to the curve by Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) and click-
ing on your image. This is beneficial if you want to ensure that these
images areas are preserved.
 If you want to adjust the color in your image choose your desired chan-
nel from the Channel pop-up menu and then adjust the curve. For more
on channels, see Book VI.
Arbitrary maps, such as the one shown in Figure 1-16, create distinctive
solarization color effects as Photoshop warps the colors of your image.
They are fun to play with, maybe useful now and then, but not nearly as
practical as your nice S curves.
Once you have created a custom curve, you may want to save it (a good
idea) to load and apply to other photos with similar contrast issues. Click
the Preset Options button, just to the left of the OK button and choose Save
Preset from the pop-up menu.

Converting to Black & White
Version CS3 has given us yet one more way to convert a color image to
grayscale. For other ways see Book II, Chapter 2 and the section “Washing
Out Color with Desaturate,” earlier in this chapter.
The great thing about this new feature is that, like the Channel Mixer, you
have a lot of control over how your colors are converted. 
Here’s how to go to grayscale using Black & White:
1. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Black & White.
Your Black and White dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-17.
In addition, Photoshop automatically applies a default conversion to
your image.

2. Adjust the conversion to your liking by doing one of the following:
• Choose a Preset: Select a preset conversion (or a custom one you
saved previously) from the drop-down list. Note that you can also
use one of the presets as a starting point and then adjust from there.
• Click Auto: This option analyzes your image’s color values and then
converts to grayscale, while trying to maximize your gray tonal
values. Again, this conversion can be used as a starting point.
• Adjust the sliders: Do your own thing. Drag the sliders left to darken
and right to lighten the tones. That’s what I did in my example in
Figure 1-17. Note that your mouse turns into an eyedropper when
you move or click over your image. Press on areas of your image to
highlight that dominant color in your dialog box. Click and drag with
the eyedropper to move the color slider for that color, making it
darker or lighter. 
If you have totally goofed up your image, press Alt (Opt on the Mac) and
click on the color chip to reset that adjustment. To reset all adjustments,
press Alt (Opt on the Mac), convert the Cancel button into Reset and click.
Once you established a custom conversion settings, save it to apply to other
similar images by clicking Save Preset from the Preset Options pop-up
menu, just to left of the OK button.
Getting colorful with Hue/Saturation
Photoshop’s Hue/Saturation controls let you adjust colors based on their hue,
saturation, and lightness. The Hue/Saturation dialog box doesn’t work with
the Red, Green, and Blue (or Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) channels of an
image. Instead, it operates on the different colors, or hues. You can select all
the colors (Master) from the Edit pop-up menu, or choose one color to modify.
Three sliders are in the Hue/Saturation dialog box. (See Figure 1-18.) 
 Hue: Shifts all the colors clockwise or counterclockwise around the
color wheel, depending on the direction you move it. I moved my Hue
slider to the left to turn my owls green and purple.
 Saturation: Increases or decreases the richness of the colors in an
image. I moved my Saturation slider to the right to increase the satura-
tion on my owls and make them almost glow.
 Lightness: Modifies the brightness values.
You can adjust any of these values by moving the sliders and watching the
results in the image window. The top color bar at the bottom of the dialog
box represents the colors in their order on the color wheel before you made
any adjustment. The lower color bar shows how the modifications you make
affect the colors.

Figure 1-18: The Hue/Saturation command enables you to adjust colors based on their hue
(color), saturation (intensity), or lightness (brightness).
When you select an individual color to adjust, sliders appear between the
color bars so that you can define the range of color to be adjusted. You can
select, add, or subtract colors from the range by choosing one of the
Eyedropper tools and clicking in the image.
The Hue/Saturation dialog box also lets you colorize images, a useful option
for creating sepia colored images, as in the Putting-It-Together project that
follows.
Using the Colorize option
Use the Colorize option in the Hue/Saturation dialog box to change the
color of any selected area to a new, solid color. This is unlike the Hue slider,
which changes only individual pixels based on their present color values.
Just follow these steps:
1. Open an image and access the Hue/Saturation dialog box by choosing
Image➪Adjustments➪Hue/ Saturation, or pressing Ctrl+U (or Ô+U on
the Mac).
2. Select the Colorize option.

3. Drag the Hue slider in either direction to change a color.
Photoshop doesn’t colorize pure white pixels and pure black pixels
because colorization affects only gray pixels (from a brightness value 1
to 254).

Putting It Together
Making a New Photo Look Old
Black-and-white photography is a newer phenomenon than you might think. Daguerreo-
types and other early photographs frequently had a brownish or bluish tone to them. You
can create sepia-toned masterpieces of your own. (Or, if you like, you can create a tint in
green, blue, or another shade.) Toned pictures can create a mood or otherwise transform
a mundane photo into something interesting.
In this Putting-It-Together project, I chose a recent photo of a boy and his donkey in
Java, Indonesia. Without any nasty anachronisms, such as automobiles or satellite
dishes, aging this image is easy.

The Photoshop Hue/Saturation feature is all you need to perform this time-traveling
magic. Just follow these easy steps:
1. Open the image in Photoshop and convert it to black and white by choosing
Image➪Adjustments➪Black & White.
You choose this command instead of the Image➪Mode➪Grayscale command to
convert the photo to black and white because you’re going to continue to work with
it as a color image — the image just won’t have colors until you add them. For more
info on the Black & White adjustment, see the earlier section, “Converting to Black
& White.”
2. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Hue/ Saturation.
The Hue/Saturation dialog box appears.
3. Select the Colorize check box so that you can add color to the image.
4. Adjust the Hue slider to produce the tone you’re looking for.
To produce a rich sepia tone, move the Hue slider to the far left. If you prefer green
or blue or some other shade, you can experiment with this slider to get the exact
color you want.
5. Adjust the Saturation slider to modify the richness of the color.
I used a setting of 25, as shown in the figure. As you move the slider to the right,
the color becomes more pure, until you end up with a striking red at the far-right
position.
6. Adjust the Lightness slider to lighten
or darken the photo, depending on
your mood.
Generally, you want to leave the
Lightness slider at the default middle
position. To create a darker, moodier
picture, move it to the left; to produce
a more faded look, move it to the right.
7. When you’re satisfied with your
changes, click OK.
Now my photo looks like a vintage postcard.
You can create similar effects by using the Photoshop Duotones, Tritones, and
Quadtones feature. See Book II, Chapter 2 for more information on these tools.

Matching Color Between Documents
The Match Color command enables you to match colors in a single image
or between images — a source image and a target image. But it doesn’t
stop there. You can also match colors between layers or even selections.
You can further refine your correction by adjusting the luminance and
color intensity (saturation). 
This command is great for getting rid of colorcasts in a single image. It
also works wonders for matching the color of the lighting between two
images or layers — for example, if you want to realistically composite an
image shot under fluorescent lighting and one shot in natural light.
The Match Color command works only with RGB images, but be sure and
apply this command before you perform any color conversions. 

Matching Color Between Documents
604
Here is how to use the Match Color command to match one image with
another:
1. Open the two images you want to match. 
If you want, you can make selections in one or both of those images —
for example, if you are creating a composite image from two separate
images and want to match the lighting color or skin tones. Without
selections, the overall target image is matched to the source image.
In my example in Figure 1-19, I selected an image taken outdoors in nat-
ural light and one taken inside under fluorescent lights, which gives it a
nasty green colorcast. I want to eventually use the girl in each image in
a composite and therefore want to try to match the skin tones.
Figure 1-19: The Match Color command lets you match colors within 
a single image or between two images.
2. Make sure your target image (the one that needs to be corrected) is
the active file and choose Image➪Adjustments➪Match Color. 
If you are using a specific layer in your target image, select that layer
prior to choosing the command. Make sure you have selected the
Preview option so you can view your adjustments on the fly.
3. In the Match Color dialog box, shown in Figure 1-20, choose your
source image from the Source pop-up menu in the Image Statistics
area. Select None if you’re working with only one image (the source
image and target image are the same). 

Matching Color Between Documents
605
Remember, the source image contains the colors you want to match in
the target image.
Figure 1-20: Choose your Target and Source images in the 
Match Color dialog box.
4. If you are using a particular layer in your source image, choose it
from the Layer pop-up menu. You can also choose the Merged option
to match the colors from all the layers.
5. If you have selections in your images, you can select one of the fol-
lowing options:
• If you have a selection in your source image but want to match the
colors from the whole image, choose the Ignore Selection when
Applying Adjustment option. It also applies the correction to the
whole target image as well.
• On the other hand, choose the Use Selection in Source to Calculate
Colors option if you want to use the colors in the selection in the
source image. Deselect this option to ignore the selection in the
source image and match the colors from the entire source image. 
• Select the Use Selection in Target to Calculate Adjustment option if
you want to adjust the color only in the selection in your target image.

6. Select the Neutralize option to remove any colorcasts in the target
image.
When using the Match Color command, your cursor becomes the Eye-
dropper tool. This allows you to sample colors on your images and look
at the color values in the Info palette while making your adjustments.
7. Adjust the luminance by moving the slider or entering a value.
A higher value increases the brightness in the target image. A lower
value decreases brightness.
8. Adjust the color intensity of your
target image. 
A higher value increases the color
saturation, while a lower value
decreases the saturation. Moving
the slider to 1 desaturates the
image to grayscale.
9. Use the Fade option to control
the amount of adjustment that is
applied to the target image,
moving the slider to the right to
reduce the amount. 
10. If you want to save your settings
to use on other images, click the
Save Statistics button. Name the
file and specify the location. 
To reload the settings later, click
the Load Statistics button and nav-
igate to the file.
11. Click OK to apply the adjustment
and exit the dialog box. 
My image, shown in Figure 1-21, has
less of that nasty green cast from the
fluorescent lighting.
Switching Colors with Replace Color
The Replace Color command creates interesting creative effects by allowing
you to substitute one set of colors for another. It does this by building a
mask using colors you select and then replacing the selected colors with
Figure 1-21: These tones are a better
match with the target image.

others that you specify. You can adjust hue, saturation, and lightness of the
masked colors.
Just follow these steps:
1. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Replace Color.
The Replace Color dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 1-22.
2. Choose either Selection or Image.
• Selection shows the mask in
the Preview window. The
masked area is black, semi-
transparent areas are shades of
gray, and unmasked areas are
white.
For details on masks, see
Book VI, Chapter 2.
• Image shows the full image
itself in the Preview window.
Use this option if you zoomed
in on the original image to
select colors more easily, but
you still want to be able to see
the full image in the preview.
3. Click the colors you want to select.
You can click either the image or
the Preview window.
4. Press the Shift key and click or use the plus (+) Eyedropper tool to
add more colors.
5. Press the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) or use the minus (–)
Eyedropper tool to remove colors.
6. To add colors similar to the ones you select, use the Fuzziness slider
to refine your selection, adding or subtracting from the selection
based on the tolerance value.
7. Move the Hue, Saturation, and Lightness sliders to change them to
new values.
8. When you like the result, click OK to apply the settings.

Increasing and Decreasing Color
Increasing and decreasing color is a popular Photoshop activity, so having
more than one way to do it is no surprise. In addition to the Selective Color
command, which I describe in the following section, several other com-
mands are a lot easier to understand — and a lot easier to use.
This is the place to start reading if you want to know all about the Gradient
Maps command, and the various color mapper tools, all of which are
designed to change the arrangement of the colors in your photos in ways
that don’t produce realistic-looking images. Images that have been color-
mapped are certainly interesting to look at.
Using the Selective Color command
The Selective Color command is chiefly of use for manipulating the amount
of process colors (that is, cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) used in printing
an image. In the Selective Color dialog box, choose the color you want to
edit from the Colors pop-up menu. Adjust the CMYK sliders to modify the
selected color. 
With the Relative method selected, you can add or subtract color. For exam-
ple, if a pixel is 30 percent cyan and you add 20 percent cyan, Photoshop
adds 6 percent cyan to the pixel (20 percent of 30 percent is 6 percent). 

Increasing and Decreasing Color
609
With the Absolute method selected, Photoshop bases the amount of change
on the exact value you enter. For example, if a pixel is 30 percent cyan and
you add 20 percent cyan, the pixel changes to a total of 50 percent cyan.
Using gradient maps
Gradient maps convert your image to grayscale, and then replace the range
of black, gray, and white tones with a gradient of your choice, in effect col-
orizing your image — often in startling ways.
Photoshop maps the lightest tones of your image to one color in the gradi-
ent and changes the darkest tones to the other color of the gradient (assum-
ing you’re using just two colors for the gradient). Photoshop changes all the
formerly gray tones to an intermediate color between the two. When you
use multiple colors or fancy gradients, the image really gets interesting. Just
follow these steps to try out this feature:
1. Open an image and access the gra-
dient map, shown in Figure 1-24,
by choosing Image➪Adjustments➪
Gradient Map.
2. Choose the gradient you want
from the gradient list.
This list is exactly like the one
offered with the Gradient tool. You
can edit the gradient used for your
map exactly as you do for the
Gradient tool. For more information on choosing gradients, see Book IV,
Chapter 2.
3. Choose either or both of these options:
• Dither adds random noise to smooth out the gradient and reduces
banding.
• Reverse changes the direction of the gradient. Use the Reverse
option to create a negative quickly.
4. Click OK to apply the gradient map.
If the effect is a little too intense for your taste, try fading the gradient
map (Edit➪Fade Gradient Mask) and then adjusting the opacity percent-
age and/or applying a different blend mode.

Adding color with photo filters
Photographers will appreciate the
Photo Filter command, which is remi-
niscent of the analog method of plac-
ing a colored filter in front of a camera
lens to tweak the color balance and
color temperature of the light coming
through the lens. This is a great way to
make an image appear cooler or
warmer. Have a portrait where your
subject appears a little too bluish?
Apply a Warming filter and bring some
rosiness back into his or her cheeks.
You can also apply a colored filter to
add a tint of color to your image.
Figure 1-25 shows how I warmed up an
overly cool image.
To apply the Photo Filter adjustment,
follow these steps:
1. Open your image and choose
Image➪Adjustments➪Photo Filter
to apply the filter to the entire
image. 
If you want to apply the filter to
one or more layers, choose
Layer➪New Adjustment Layer➪Photo Filter.
2. Make sure you have the Preview option selected so you can view the
results.
3. In the dialog box, select the Filter radio button to choose a preset
filter from the Filter drop-down list, or select the Color radio button
to select a custom color for your filter.
See Table 1-1 for a brief description of the filters on the Filter drop-
down list.
If you opt for the custom color, click the swatch to choose a color from
the Color Picker.
4. Select the Preserve Luminosity check box if you don’t want the filter
to darken your image. Note that some photo pros advocate not check-
ing this option, but it’s up to you.

Colors
These filters adjust the hue of an image. You can choose a color to
get rid of a colorcast. For example, if your image is too green,
choose magenta. If it is too blue, choose yellow. You can also
choose a color to apply a special effect. 
Playing with the color mappers
Photoshop also includes some fun-filled color mapping commands, so-called
because they change the colors of your image in specific ways. Two of them,
Invert and Equalize, don’t even have any options. They’re akin to single-step
filters that you apply and forget. (I cover filters in Book VII.) I show all the
color mappers in Figure 1-26.
Invert
Invert simply reverses all the colors and tones in your image, creating a neg-
ative image. Photoshop changes black tones to white; white tones to black;
dark grays to light grays; and colors to their complements. For example, a
light yellow color becomes a dark blue, and so forth.
Some folks mistakenly think they can use this command to create a positive
(or color correct) version of a scanned color negative. It isn’t so simple
because color negatives have an orange mask overlaying the color infor-
mation. To really do that correctly requires a lot of color correcting and
tweaking. If you have sophisticated scanning software you may have a 
command that does the conversion. A couple third-party Photoshop filters
also do the duty. But to do it manually requires a lot of color correcting and
tweaking. Something you may not want to try at home!

Equalize
This command locates the lightest and darkest pixels in an image, defines
them as white and black, respectively, and then changes all the other pixels
in between to divide the grayscale values evenly. Depending on your image,
this process may increase contrast or otherwise alter the color and tones as
the values are evenly distributed.
Threshold
Threshold converts your image to black and white, with all pixels that are
brighter than a value you specify represented as white, and all pixels that
are darker than that value as black. You can change the threshold level to

Posterize
This color mapper creates an interesting graphic effect by reducing the
number of colors in your image to a value you specify, from 2 to 255. Low
values provide distinct poster-like effects. As you increase the number of
color levels, the image begins to look either more normal, or a bit like a bad
conversion to Indexed Color.

Cleaning Up a Line Art Scan
Line art consists of (you guessed it!) lines, rather than the continuous tones of a photo-
graph or painting. Line art can consist of outlines, shapes (like you’d find in a bar chart),
patterns (like the fills in the bar chart), or freehand drawings like those produced in pen
or pencil. 
What you don’t want to see when you scan line art is an extra color: the background
color of the paper. Often the paper appears as a dull gray, and you may see other arti-
facts you don’t want, such as wrinkles or spots in the paper.
Luckily, Photoshop has a handy Threshold command that you can use to determine
which tones appear as black and which are
dropped altogether. You end up with a nice
black-and-white line art image with all the
intermediate tones removed.
Follow these instructions to clean up a
piece of line art (to test-drive these steps,
download my example image from this
book’s Web site):
1. Open a line drawing in Photoshop, as
shown in the figure.
2. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Threshold from the menu bar.
The Threshold dialog box includes a
chart called a histogram. The histogram
includes a series of vertical lines show-
ing how many of an image’s tones are
represented by a certain brightness

level. You can see that a relatively
small number of tones are represented
by a brightness value of 93, marked by
the gray triangle at the bottom of the
histogram. Many more tones are used
at the other levels, forming a sloping
mountain in the chart.
3. Move the slider to the right until the
tones you want to appear in the image
are shown.
The more you move the slider to the
right, the darker the image gets. A
threshold of about 170 seems about
right for this image.
4. Click OK to apply the modification.
Some small artifacts may remain in
your image, as shown in the figure.
These are spots and parts of wrinkles
that are darker than the page back-
ground, approaching the darkness of
the line art itself.
5. To clean up these slight defects, use
the Eraser tool.

Chapter 2: Repairing with the
Focus and Toning Tools
In This Chapter
 Dodging and burning
 Manipulating color with the Sponge tool
 Smudging rough spots smooth
 Blurring for effect
 Focusing on sharpness
O
ne of the coolest things about Photoshop is the way it offers several
tools to accomplish similar end results, but with distinctly individual-
ized looks. The focus and toning tools in Photoshop are examples of this.
The focus tools blur, sharpen, and smudge your image in much the
same way as the Blur, Sharpen, and Liquify filters (which I cover
in Book VII). The toning tools lighten, darken, and change
the richness of the color in your image a bit like com-
mands such as Levels, Curves, and Hue/Saturation
(covered in Book VIII, Chapter 1).
But where their counterparts operate only on
layers or selections, the focus and toning tools let
you paint the effects you want directly onto your
image. Using these tools, you can often create
much more subtle, natural looks tailored to meet
your exact needs, as I explain in this chapter.
As you work through this chapter, keep in mind all the
tips I give you in Book IV, Chapter 1 about using brushes.
Most of that information applies to the brush-like focus and
toning tools, as well.
Lightening and Darkening with Dodge and Burn Tools
Dodging and burning originated in the darkroom, where photographers sal-
vage negatives containing areas that are too dark or too light by adding or
subtracting a bit of exposure as an enlarger makes prints.

Lightening and Darkening with Dodge and Burn Tools
616
An enlarger makes a print by projecting an image of a negative onto a piece
of photosensitive paper. During the exposure, the darkroom technician can
reduce the amount of light falling onto the paper by placing some object
(often a disk shape of cardboard or metal impaled on a piece of wire) in the
light-path to dodge part of the image. The worker can burn other parts of an
image by exposing only a small portion through an opening, such as the fin-
gers in a cupped pair of hands. The Dodge and Burn tools in Photoshop
adopt their icons from the most popular real-world tools used to achieve
these effects in the darkroom.
However, the Photoshop counterparts are a great deal more flexible. For
example, the worker in a darkroom varies the size of the dodging or burning
tool by moving it up or down in the light path. Unfortunately, the closer the
real-world tool gets to the paper, the sharper it appears, forcing the dark-
room worker to move the tool more rapidly and frequently to blur the edges
of the lighten or darken effects. With the Photoshop Dodge and Burn tools,
you can set the size of the tool and its softness independently simply by
selecting a brush of the size and hardness or softness you require.
You can also set the Photoshop tools to operate primarily on shadows, mid-
tones, and highlights. You can adjust the degree of lightening and darkening
applied by specifying an exposure, too.
The Dodge and Burn tools can be very effective tools, but you can’t add
detail that isn’t there. Keep the following in mind:
 When you lighten very dark shadows that contain little detail, you end
up with grayish shadows. 
 Darkening very light areas that are completely washed out won’t look
very good either. 
In either case, you want to use the Dodge and Burn tools in moderation, and
work only with small areas. To dodge or burn a portion of an image, just
follow these steps:
1. Open an image with under- or overexposed areas and choose the
Dodge or Burn tool from the Tools palette. 
Press the O key to choose the active toning tool, or press Shift+O to
cycle through the available toning tools until the one you want is active.
2. Select a brush from the Brushes palette. 
Larger, softer brushes spread the dodging and burning effect over a
larger area, making blending with the surrounding area easier. 
You can choose the same brushes available with any of the painting
tools, including preset brushes from your library. 
3. From the Range options, select Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights. 

Turning Down the Color with the Sponge Tool
617
Use Shadows to lighten or darken
detail in the darker areas of your
image, Midtones to adjust the tones
of average darkness, and Highlights
to make the brightest areas even
lighter or, more frequently, darker. 
In Figure 2-1, the original image
(top) had mostly dark areas, so I
dodged the shadows. I also gave a
couple swipes to the highlight
areas with the Burn tool.
4. Choose the amount of the effect
to apply with each stroke using
the Exposure slider or text box. 
5. Paint over the areas you want to
lighten or darken with the toning
brush, gradually building up the
desired effect.
Using a soft-edged brush is often
best when dodging and burning.
You want to create a realistic, un-
retouched appearance.
The Exposure control is similar to
the Opacity control offered by
other painting tools, but it’s espe-
cially important with dodging and
burning.
Using a low value is best (I often
work with 10% exposure or less) so
you can carefully paint in the light-
ening or darkening you want.
High exposure values work too quickly and produce unnatural-looking,
obviously dodged or burned areas in your images.
For an even softer, more gradual effect, click the Airbrush option on the
Options bar.
6. If you go too far, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to reverse the stroke.
7. When you finish, choose File➪Save to store the image.
Turning Down the Color with the Sponge Tool
The Sponge tool, which soaks up color like, well, a sponge, reduces the rich-
ness or intensity (or saturation) of a color in the areas you paint. It can also
perform the reverse, imbuing a specific area with richer, more vibrant colors. 
Book VIII
Chapter 2
Repairing with 
the Focus and
Toning Tools
Figure 2-1: The Dodge and Burn tools are
effective when touching up smaller dark
and light areas.

Turning Down the Color with the Sponge Tool
618
Surprisingly, the Sponge tool also works in grayscale mode, pushing light
and dark pixels toward a middle gray, providing a darkening or lightening
effect to those pixels. Unlike the Hue/Saturation or Desaturate commands
(Image➪Adjustments), which work only on layers or selections, you can use
the Sponge tool on any area you can paint with a brush.
You can use the Sponge tool on an image in subtle ways to reduce the satura-
tion in selected areas for an interesting effect. For example, you may have an
object that is the center of attention in your picture simply because the colors
are so bright (or even garish). The Sponge tool lets you reduce the color satu-
ration of that area (only) to allow the other sections of your image to come to
the forefront. You can also use the Sponge tool to make an artistic statement:
You could reduce or increase the saturation of a single person in a group shot
to make that person stand out (perhaps as being more colorful than the rest).
To use the Sponge tool, just follow these steps:
1. Open an image and choose the Sponge tool from the Tools palette. 
Press the O key to choose the Sponge if it is the active toning tool, or
press Shift+O to cycle through the Sponge, Dodge, and Burn tools until
the Sponge tool is active.
2. Select a brush from the Brushes palette.
Use large, soft brushes to saturate/desaturate a larger area. 
Smaller brushes are useful mostly
when you need to change the satu-
ration of a specific small object in
an image.
3. Select either Desaturate (reduce
color richness) or Saturate
(increase color richness) from the
Mode pop-up menu.
4. Choose a flow rate (the speed
with which the saturation/desatu-
ration effect builds up as you
apply the brush) with the Flow
slider or text box.
5. If you want an even softer effect,
choose the Airbrush option.
6. Paint carefully over the areas you
want to saturate or desaturate
with color. 
In Figure 2-2, I saturated one of the
Tibetan monks to make him more
a focal point and desaturated the
others.

Smoothing with the Smudge Tool
619
Smoothing with the Smudge Tool
Although grouped among the focus
tools, the Smudge tool performs more
of a warping effect, something like the
Warp tool in the Liquify dialog box (see
Book VII, Chapter 3 for information on
this command).
Smudge pushes your pixels around on
the screen as if they consisted of wet
paint, using the color that’s under the
cursor when you start to stroke.
However, don’t view the Smudge tool
as a simple distortion tool that pro-
duces only comical effects. I use it on
tiny areas of an image to soften the
edges of objects in a way that often
looks more natural than blurring tools.
The Smudge tool can come in handy
when retouching images to create a
soft, almost painted look, as shown in
Figure 2-3. Just don’t go too gung-ho or
you may obliterate detail that you
want to preserve.
Smudged areas may be obvious because of their smooth appearance.
Adding a little texture using the Noise filter after you smudge is often a good
idea, if you want to blend a smudged section in with its surroundings. You
find tips on applying Noise in Book VII, Chapter 2.
To apply the Smudge tool, just follow these steps:
1. Open the image and choose the Smudge tool from the Tools palette. 
Press the R key to select it, or press Shift+R to cycle through the available
focus tools (including Blur and Sharpen) until the one you want is active.
2. Choose the settings you want from the Options bar.
3. Select a brush from the Brushes palette. 
Use a small brush for smudging tiny areas, such as edges. Larger
brushes produce drastic effects, so use them with care.
4. Choose a blending mode from the Mode pop-up menu.
5. Choose the strength of the smudging effect with the Strength slider or
text box. 
Low values produce a lighter smudging effect; high values really push
your pixels around.

6. If your image has multiple layers, you can select the Sample All
Layers option to tell Photoshop to use the color information from
all the visible layers to produce the smudge effect. 
The smudge still appears only on the active layer, but the look is a bit
different, depending on the contents of the underlying layers.
7. Use the Finger Painting option to begin the smudge using the fore-
ground color. 
You can get some interesting effects with this option.
You can switch the Smudge tool into Finger Painting mode temporarily
by pressing the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) as you drag.
8. Paint over the areas you want to smudge.
9. Watch the screen carefully as you smudge so that you can redirect
your daubs to achieve the look you want.
This tool can be a little on the destructive side. If you’re looking to pre-
serve reality, use it with restraint. If you want to get wild, go crazy.
10. When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.
Softening with the Blur Tool
Adding a little blur here and there can
save an image with a few defects.
Blurring can also be used for artistic
effect — say to add a little motion to a
soccer ball frozen in time by too-fast a
shutter speed. You can also blur por-
tions of your image to emphasize and
focus on a particular element, as
shown in Figure 2-4, where I blurred
the flowers a bit to draw attention to
the butterfly. The Photoshop Blur tool
makes painting your blur effects
exactly where you want them easy.
The Blur tool doesn’t push pixels
around like the Smudge tool. Instead,
the Blur tool decreases the contrast
among adjacent pixels in the area
painted.

rough edge or make your element more a
focal point by blurring its surroundings.

Cranking Up the Focus with the Sharpen Tool
621
The mechanics of using the Blur tool and several of its options are similar to
those of the Smudge tool. Just follow these steps:
1. Open an image and choose the Blur tool from the Tools palette. 
Press the R key to select it if it happens to be the active focus tool, or
press Shift+R to cycle through the Sharpen and Smudge tools until the
Blur tool is active.
2. Select a brush from the Brushes palette. 
Use a small brush for applying small areas of blur. 
Use larger brushes with caution, say, to blur the entire background to
make a foreground object appear sharper in comparison.
3. Choose a blending mode from the Mode pop-up menu.
4. Choose the strength of the blurring effect with the Strength slider or
text box.
5. If your image has multiple layers, you can select the Use All Layers
option to blur based on the pixel information in all visible layers in
your image. 
This can produce a smoother blur when you merge the layers later.
6. Paint over the areas you want to blur.
7. When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.
Cranking Up the Focus with the Sharpen Tool
In theory, the Sharpen tool is nothing more than the Blur tool in reverse —
instead of decreasing contrast among pixels, the Sharpen tool increases the
contrast. In practice, however, you need to use this tool with a bit more care.
Where blurred areas tend to fade from a viewer’s notice (at least in terms of
how our eyes perceive them), sharpened areas of an image jump out at people. 
If you blur an area a little too much, you may not even notice. But even a
small area that has been over-sharpened can change the entire appearance
of an image — and not flatteringly.
You can often successfully sharpen small areas with the Sharpen tool.
Sometimes the eyes in a portrait can benefit from a little sharpening,
as shown in Figure 2-5. Or, you might want to sharpen an area to make it
stand out more distinctly against a slightly blurred background.
Book VIII

Cranking Up the Focus with the Sharpen Tool
622
Here are the simple steps to follow to use the Sharpen tool:
1. Choose the Sharpen tool from the Tools palette.
Press the R key to select it directly if it’s the last focus tool used. If not,
press Shift+R to cycle through the Blur and Smudge tools to activate the
Sharpen tool.
2. Select the brush of your choice
from the Brushes palette.
3. Choose a blending mode from
the Mode pop-up menu.
4. Choose the strength of the sharp-
ening effect with the Strength
slider or text box.
Using a fairly low value (say, 25%
or less) is a good idea because you
can build up sharpness slowly,
being careful not to overdo it. 
You know you have gone too far
with the sharpness when the pixels
start to look noisy and grainy.
5. Use the information on all your
layers for Photoshop’s contrast-
increasing algorithms by select-
ing the Use All Layers option.
6. Paint over the areas you want to sharpen.
7. When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.
Sharpening increases contrast, so be careful when using the Sharpen tool
if you plan to also adjust the Levels or Curves controls. Any change that
increases contrast in the whole image also boosts the contrast of an area
you’ve sharpened.
The Unsharp Mask or Smart Sharpen filters offer more options and better
overall control, so unless you really need to paint the sharpening effect,
you’re usually better off using the filter. If you really want to apply the effect
with brushstrokes, you can always apply the Unsharp Mask filter to a whole
layer, take a snapshot, undo the filter operation, and then use the snapshot
as a source to paint from using the History palette. See Book II, Chapter 4
for information on how to paint from the History palette.

Putting It Together
Fixing an Underexposed Foreground
Sometimes editing tools just don’t cut the mustard when it comes to fixing large areas of
an underexposed image. Instead, you have to use three tools together to repair the
damage: a filter, a fill, and a blend mode. 
If you’re like me, you’ve taken at least a couple of photos where your subject was lit from
behind, thereby underexposing the foreground and burying the subject in the shadows.
You can try the Shadow and Highlight adjustment, on the Image➪Adjustment menu,
which usually does a good job of fixing the problem. But if you’re not satisfied with that
adjustment, you can follow this old-school method. Or you can even go for a combo plate
and use them both. Here’s how to bring your subject back into the light:
1. Open the image in need of repair.
2. Choose Image➪Duplicate. 
3. Name the file Repair and click OK in
the dialog box.
4. Select Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. Click
OK to discard the color information.
Photoshop has now stripped the color
from the image. Don’t worry; this is just
an intermediary step.
5. On the duplicate image, choose
Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur. Enter a radius value and click OK.
For a low resolution image (72 ppi), 5
pixels is enough. For higher resolution
images (300 ppi), use 20 pixels. Your goal
is to get rid of the detail in the image.
6. Return to the original image. Choose
Select➪Load Selection.
Under Document make sure it says
Repair. 
7. Choose Gray for the Channel. Select
the Invert box. In the Operation area,
leave the setting as New Selection.
Click OK to load the Load Selection
dialog box, as shown in the figure.
continued

Cranking Up the Focus with the Sharpen Tool
624
You’re loading the only available channel in the duplicate grayscale image as a
selection. 
A selection outline appears, which corresponds to the blurry gray areas in your
duplicate image.
8. Choose Edit➪Fill. In the dialog box
that appears, shown in the figure,
select 50% Gray from the Use pop-up
menu. Select Color Dodge from the
Mode pop-up menu. Leave the Opacity
at 100%. Click OK.
Although Photoshop fills the selection
with 50 percent gray, the Color Dodge
mode lightens the pixels in the image,
creating a kind of bleaching effect. 
9. You can now see the subject of your image in a better light, as in my image.

ay you want to duplicate an element in your image.
That’s easy enough, right? Make a selection and copy
and paste it into the new location. Presto. That works
fine most of the time. But what if the element has a
shadow behind it, next to it, over it, or under it?
You face the dilemma of having a hard edge on the
copied element because the shadow (called a cast
shadow) is cut off by the selection outline. You
could feather the selection, but then you have to
make sure that the copied element blends realisti-
cally with the background. What a pain. The better
method is to clone the element using the Clone Stamp
tool. It’s quick, easy, and no one will know that only
one element was there originally. 
Here’s another hypothetical situation: What if you already
have the right number of elements but some unsightly flaw mars
your otherwise perfect image? Or maybe the corporate executive, whose
head shot you took last week, has requested a little digital Botox around the
eyes and mouth. No problem. You can take care of wrinkles, scars, blemishes,
scratches, spots, and any other nasty imperfections in a matter of minutes
in Photoshop with the healing tools. And if your flaw is a nasty case of red
eye, you can grab the Red Eye tool and take care of it with a few swipes.

Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
626
Not into people, but architecture you say? Not a problem. Photoshop’s
Vanishing Point feature lets you easily make realistic edits in images with
perspective plans, such as buildings. 
In this chapter, I reveal secrets of cloning that won’t make medical ethicists
scream. I show you how to heal scars, scratches, and other imperfections
without calling a plastic surgeon. And you can now add or remove windows
or doors without forking out a dime to a contractor.
Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
Tell Dolly the sheep to move over and make room. The Clone Stamp tool,
one of Photoshop’s more popular tools, always arouses a “Wow,” “Cool,” or
similar remark of approval when demonstrated.
Believe it or not, you can also reach for this tool when retouching imperfec-
tions such as scratches, scars, bruises, and other minor flaws. In fact, that
used to be one of its major functions. In some retouching instances it does a
great job, although the advent of the Healing Brush and Patch tools has rele-
gated the Clone Stamp tool more to the pure cloning functions and less to
the hard-core retouching jobs.
Using the Clone Stamp tool
The Clone Stamp tool works its magic by taking sampled pixels from one
area and clones (or copies) them onto another area. Cloning is often better
than making a selection, copying, and pasting it because cloning allows you
to retain soft edges on details such as shadows, giving you a more realistic
duplicate image.
Version CS3 has given the Clone Stamp tool additional respect with the new
Clone Source palette. This palette enables you to see a preview, in an over-
lay style, of the source pixels you are cloning with.
Follow these steps to clone an element without any genetic engineering:
1. Open an image and select the Clone Stamp tool from the Tools
palette.
Press the S key on the keyboard. 
You have several options to choose from on the Options bar.
2. Select a brush and change its size or shape in the Brush Preset picker
drop-down palette.
For more information on brushes, see Book IV, Chapter 1.

Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
627
3. Specify the Clone Stamp tool’s brush size to control the area that
you’re cloning. 
I recommend having your Clone Stamp tool cursor display your Full Size
Brush Tip so you can judge the amount of the area you are cloning. To
do so, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Cursors (Photoshop➪Preferences➪
Cursors on Mac OS X). Select the Full Size Brush Tip radio button from
the Painting Cursors area of the dialog box. 
I used a 65-pixel, feathered brush. 
4. Choose the blend mode of your choice.
Selecting a mode such as Difference, Multiply, or Color can produce
some interesting special effects. For more on modes, see Book V,
Chapter 3. I left my setting at Normal.
5. To make the clone more or less opaque, use the Opacity slider or text
box on the Options bar.
I left the opacity at 100%.
6. Specify how fast the Clone Stamp tool applies the clone by adjusting
the Flow rate percentage. 
Again I left my option at 100%.
7. Click the Airbrush option for Airbrushing capabilities if so desired.
8. Select or deselect the Aligned option depending on your preference.
With Aligned selected, the clone source moves when you move your
cursor to a different location. If you want to clone multiple times from
the same location, leave the Aligned option deselected. I left mine
selected.
9. Select the All Layers option from the Sample option drop-down list to
clone part of an image with multiple layers. 
This enables you to sample pixels in all the visible layers for the clone.
If you choose the Current Layer option, the Clone Stamp tool clones
only from the active layer. And if you select the new Current and Below
option, you will sample pixels from the current layer and all layers
below it.
10. If you selected All Layers in Step 9, you can choose whether or not to
ignore any Adjustment Layers when cloning. By ignoring Adjustment
Layers, you may prevent the bizarre results that can sometimes
occur by double-applying your adjustment layers during the cloning
process.
11. Choose Window➪Clone Source to open the new Clone Source palette,
as shown in Figure 3-1. Specify the following options:

Figure 3-1: The new Clone Source palette assists in the cloning process.
• Sampling Sources: In Step 12 you will define a sampling source by
Alt (Option on the Mac) clicking on the area of the image that you
want to clone. However, if you want to create multiple sampling
sources, you can do so in the Clone Source palette by selecting a dif-
ferent Clone Source button and repeating this Alt (Option) clicking
process on other areas of your image. Most of us probably won’t
need to use more than one source. Multiple sampling sources are
useful for video editors where tight registration between frames that
need cloning is critical.
• Transformations: Adjust the rotation, position or scale of your
clone. Select the link icon to maintain your W and H aspect ratio.
Click the small arrow underneath to reset your transformation set-
tings. I wanted my cloned tiger to be a twin of the one that’s there,
so I left the settings at their default.
You can use scrubby sliders by hovering over the transformation
label (H. W. and so on) of the field and dragging left or right. Press
Alt (Opt on the Mac) to make your changes slower. Press Shift to
make your changes faster.
• Overlay: If desired, click the Show Overlay option. Applying an 
overlay is especially useful when cloning subjects that need to be
in alignment with the underlying image. Adjust the Opacity to your
desired percentage. I used 30% in my example. If desired, check the
Auto-Hide option. When you release your mouse you will see a
ghosted preview of how your cloned pixels will appear on the image.

Overlay

While you’re painting, however, the overlay will be hidden. Choose a
blend mode for your overlay. Depending on your source pixels, a
blend mode other than Normal may work better in aligning your
cloned image with the underlying image. Check Invert to reverse
the colors and tones in your overlay. This may also assist you in
aligning areas.
To temporarily display the overlay, use the shortcut of Alt+Shift+Click
(Opt+Shift+Click), after setting your source. Note that you can drag
your display around and then once you have your desired location,
click and set it down.
You’ll find the same options under the Clone Source palette pop-
up menu.
12. Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) the area of your image that you
want to clone. By doing this you are defining the source. 
13. Click or drag along the area where you want the clone to appear, as
shown in Figure 3-2.
As you drag, Photoshop displays a crosshair icon along with your
Clone Stamp cursor. The crosshair represents the source you are
cloning from while the Clone Stamp cursor shows where the clone is
being painted. As you move the mouse, the crosshair moves as well.
This provides a continuous reference to the area of your image that
you’re cloning. Keep an eye on the crosshair, or you may clone some-
thing you don’t want. Try to clone your entire object in one fell swoop
so it doesn’t get fragmented.

you want your clone to appear.

Tips for excellent cloning results
Here are a few useful tidbits regarding the Clone Stamp tool:
 Use the Clone Stamp tool for fixing simple flaws: To clean up a flaw
that is pretty straight, such as a stray hair or scratch, Alt+click (Option+
click on the Mac) with the tool to define the source. Then click at one
end of the straight flaw and Shift+click at the other end. The cloned
source pixels then cover up the flaw.
 Pay attention to the origin point for sampling: Depending on what
you’re cloning (for example, when covering up a flaw), if you keep sam-
pling from the same point without ever varying it, the area you’re
cloning starts to look like ugly shag carpeting. Or at best, starts to
appear blotchy and over-retouched. 
 Zoom out once in a while to check how your overall image is looking.
You can avoid those funky telltale clone stamp repetitive patterns and
blotches.
 Clone patterns: To use the Pattern Stamp tool, which shares the flyout
menu with the Clone Stamp tool, select a custom pattern from the
Pattern picker drop-down palette on the Options bar. Drag with the
Pattern Stamp tool, and you see the pattern appear.

Digital Bandaging with the Healing Brush Tool
631
Digital Bandaging with the Healing Brush Tool
The Healing Brush and Patch tools are similar to the Clone Stamp tool. They
let you clone pixels from one area and apply them to another area. But that’s
where the healing tools leave the Clone Stamp tool eating their dust. 
The problem with the Clone Stamp tool is that it doesn’t take the tonality
of the flawed area — the shadows, midtones, and highlights — into consid-
eration. So if the pixels you are sampling from aren’t shaded and lit exactly
like the ones you’re covering, you have a mismatch in color, which makes
seamless and indecipherable repairs hard to achieve.
That’s where the Healing Brush tool comes in. This very intelligent tool
clones by using the texture from the sampled area (the source) and then
using the colors around the brush stroke as you paint over the flawed area
(the destination). The highlights, midtones, and shadows remain intact, and
the result of the repair is more realistic and natural — not retouched and
phony. Here are the steps to heal your favorite, but imperfect photo:
1. Open your image and select the
Healing Brush tool.
My guy, shown in Figure 3-4, looks
like he could stand to get some
“work done,” as they say in
Hollywood. Note that you can
also heal between two images.
Just make sure that they have the
same color mode.
2. On the Options bar, click the
Brush Preset picker.
In the drop-down palette, select
your desired diameter and hard-
ness for your brush tip. You do
this several times while retouching
your image. Using the appropriate
brush size for the flaw you are
repairing is important.
3. Leave the blend mode set to
Normal.
You can change your blend mode
if necessary. The Replace mode
preserves textures, such as noise
or film grain, around the edges of your strokes. For most simple
retouching jobs, such as this one, you can leave it at Normal.

Figure 3-4: The Healing Brush can make
these wrinkles practically disappear.

4. Choose a Source option.
You have a choice between Sampled and Pattern.
• Sampled, which you will probably use 99 percent of the time, uses
the pixels from the image. 
• Regarding Pattern, well, you can probably infer that it uses pixels
from a pattern you have selected from the Pattern picker drop-down
palette.
For my example, I am sticking with Sampled because I don’t think my
guy would look that good with a Tie-Dye or Nebula pattern across his
face. He’s just way too corporate for that.
5. Select how you want to align the sampled pixels.
When you click or drag with the Healing Brush tool, Photoshop
displays a crosshair along with the Healing Brush cursor. The cross-
hair represents the sampling point, also known as the source. As you
move the Healing Brush tool, the crosshair also moves, providing 
a constant reference to the area that you are sampling. However, if
you deselect the Aligned option on the Options bar, Photoshop
applies the source pixels from your initial sampling point, despite how
many times you stop and start dragging. I left Aligned selected in my
example.
Select the All Layers option from the Sample drop-down palette to heal
an image using all visible layers. Select Current Layer if you wish to heal
only from the active layer. Choose Current Layer and Below to heal from
your active layer and all layers beneath it.
Note that you can use the new Clone Source palette with the Healing
tools, as well as with the Clone Stamp tool. For details, see the section
“Cloning with the Clone Stamp tool.”
For maximum flexibility, select the Sample All Layers options and add a
new, blank layer above the image you want to heal. When you heal the
image, the pixels appear on the new layer and not on the image itself.
You can then adjust opacity, blend modes, and make other tweaks to
the “healed” pixels.
6. If you selected All Layers in Step 9, you can choose whether or not to
ignore any Adjustment Layers when healing. By ignoring Adjustment
Layers, you may prevent the bizarre results that can sometimes
occur by double-applying your adjustment layers during the healing
process.

Patching without Seams

7. Establish the sampling point by
Alt+clicking (Option+clicking on
the Mac). Make sure to click the
area of your image you want to
clone from.
In my example, I clicked the
smooth area on the chin and 
portions of the forehead.
8. Release the Alt (Option on the
Mac) key and click or drag over
the area of your image that con-
tains the flaw.
Pay attention to where the cross-
hair is located because that’s the
area you are sampling from.
In my example, I brushed over the
wrinkles under and around the
eyes and on the forehead, as
shown in Figure 3-5. I also zapped
some dark spots here and there.
Save the file, close it, and send in
your invoice for your digital der-
mabrasion. 
Patching without Seams
While the Patch tool is similar to the Healing Brush tool in theory, its 
application method is slightly different. Instead of painting over the
flaws with a brush, you select your flawed area and apply a patch to that
selection. 
The Patch tool does a good job in fixing larger flawed areas or isolated
imperfections rather than a few wrinkles or scars here and there. What’s
more, it’s a breeze to use. 
Here are steps to patching an area in need of repair:
1. Open your image and select the Patch tool.

It looks like a patch of material.
The girl in my image, shown in
Figure 3-6, is virtually flawless,
although I can’t say the same for
the wall she is leaning against.
2. Choose Source or Destination on
the Options bar.
Choose Source if you want to
select the flawed area. Select
Destination if you want to select
the good area you want to clone
from. You can also choose Pattern
if you so desire.
Choose the Transparent option to
patch from your source pixels in
with less opaqueness.
You can use the new Clone Source
palette with the Patch tool. For
details, see the section “Cloning
with the Clone Stamp tool.”
3. Drag around the flawed area of
your image.
Think of the Patch tool as a kind of
super cloning Lasso tool. Drag
completely around the flawed
area as you would when selecting
with the Lasso tool. If you need to,
you can apply a slight feather of

You can actually select your
flawed area with any selection tool
you like. After you have your selec-
tion, then select the Patch tool and
proceed to Step 4.
4. Drag your selection to the area
on your image that you want to
clone (or sample) from, as shown
in Figure 3-8.
5. When you release the mouse,
Photoshop patches your flawed
selection with the cloned pixels.
6. Repeat the process as needed. 
After several patches, the wall
now looks almost as good as the

Zeroing In with the Spot Healing Brush

Zeroing In with the Spot Healing Brush
Whereas the Healing Brush is designed to fix larger flawed areas, the Spot
Healing Brush is designed for smaller blemishes and little imperfections.
The biggest difference between the Healing Brush and the Spot Healing
Brush is that the Spot Healing Brush doesn’t require you to specify a sam-
pling source. It automatically takes a sample from around the area to be
retouched. The good news is it’s quick and easy. The downside is that it
doesn’t give you as much control over the sampling source. Consequently,
reserve this tool for small and simple flaws.
Here’s how to quickly fix little, nitpicky imperfections with the Spot Healing
Brush tool:
1. Open your image and grab the
Spot Healing Brush tool.
The small moles in Figure 3-10 are
examples of small areas you can
fix with the Spot Healing brush.
2. On the Options bar, click the
Brush Preset picker and select
your desired diameter and hard-
ness for your brush tip.
Try to select a brush that is a little
larger than the flawed area you
wish to fix.
3. Choose a blend mode from the Options bar.
Like the Healing Brush, you can also choose the Replace mode. Most
likely the Normal mode will work the best.
4. Choose a type from the Options bar.
You have a choice between Proximity Match and Create Texture.
• Proximity Match: Samples the pixels around the edge of the selec-
tion to use to fix the flawed area. 
• Create Texture: Uses all the pixels in the selection to create a tex-
ture to fix the flaw. 
Try Proximity Match first and if it doesn’t work, undo and try Create
Texture.
5. Choose Sample All Layers to heal an image using all visible layers. If
left unselected, you heal only from the active layer.
6. Click, or click and drag, on the area you want to fix.

Colorizing with the Color Replacement Tool
637
In Figure 3-11, I used the Spot
Healing Brush for the moles and
spots on the upper lip and cheeks.
But for the mole over the eyebrow, I
broke out the Healing Brush. I found
I needed more control of the sam-
pling source due to the mole being
so close to the hair of the eyebrow.
Colorizing with the Color
Replacement Tool
The Color Replacement tool allows you to replace the original color of an image
with the foreground color. You can use this tool in a variety of ways. Create the
look of a hand-painted photo by colorizing a grayscale image. Or maybe you
just want to change the color of an object or two, such as a couple of flowers
in a bouquet. And although Photoshop now has a bona-fide Red Eye tool, a
practical use of the Color Replacement tool is to easily paint away red eye. 
The great thing about the Color Replacement tool is that, like the other healing
tools, it completely preserves the tonality of the image. The color that you
apply doesn’t obliterate the midtones, shadows, and highlights as it would if
you were using the regular Brush tool. The Color Replacement tool works by
first sampling the original colors in the image and then replacing those colors
with the foreground color. By specifying different sampling methods, limits, and
tolerance settings, you can control the range of colors that Photoshop replaces.
This weapon in the arsenal of retouching tools is a cinch to use. Here are the
short steps to replacing color:
1. Open your image and select the Color Replacement tool. Remember it
shares a flyout menu with the regular Brush and Pencil tools.
It looks like a brush with a square and two arrows next to it. Use the B
(or Shift+B) key to select it from the keyboard.
2. On the Options bar, click the Brush Preset picker.
In the drop-down palette, select your desired diameter and hardness for
your brush tip. 
3. Select your desired blend mode. 
• Color is the default mode and works well for most colorizing jobs.
Use this mode if you’re trying to get rid of red eye.
• Hue is similar to color, but is less intense and provides a lighter effect.
Set your foreground color to Black in the Tools palette and set the
mode to Saturation to convert a color image to a grayscale image.

• Luminosity is the exact opposite of the Color mode and while it can
create a beautiful effect between two image layers, it doesn’t pro-
vide that great of an effect with this tool.
For a full “scientific” definition of each blend mode, check out
Book IV, Chapter 1.
4. Select your sampling method.
The default of Continuous allows you to sample and replace color con-
tinuously as you drag your mouse. Choose Once to replace colors only
in areas containing the color that you first sample by clicking. And
finally, select Background Swatch to replace colors only in areas con-
taining your current Background color.
5. Select your sampling limits mode.
The default of Contiguous lets you replace the color of pixels containing
the sampled color that are adjacent to each other only. Discontiguous
lets you replace the color of the pixels containing the sampled color
wherever it occurs in your image. And Find Edges allows you to replace
the color of pixels containing the sampled color while preserving the
sharpness of the edges of the objects.
6. Specify your tolerance percentage.
Tolerance refers to a range of
color. A higher tolerance lets you
replace a broader range of color. A
lower tolerance limits the replace-
ment of color only to areas that
are similar to the sampled color.
7. Choose whether you want 
anti-aliasing.
Remember anti-aliasing slightly
softens and smooths the edge of
the selected or sampled areas.
8. After you establish your settings,
click or drag on your image.
Notice how the foreground color,
which in my example is black,
replaces the original colors of the
sampled areas (see Figure 3-12).
Of course, the exact effect you get
depends on your settings.

tool to replace the original color in your
image with your current foreground color. 

Getting Rid of Dreaded Red Eye
639
Getting Rid of Dreaded Red Eye
Red eye occurs when the subject of a picture looks directly into the flash,
and the unfortunate result is that eerie reddish luminescence in the eyes
that says, “I may very well be a demon child.” 
Many cameras have a red-eye prevention mode that causes the subjects’
irises to contract, making their pupils smaller when the second flash (that
is, the real flash) goes off. Other cameras mount the flash high or to one side
of the lens, which also minimizes the chance of red eye. However, these pre-
ventive measures are of little solace when you have a great picture that fea-
tures bright red pupils as its most dominating feature.
If you’ve been hanging around in Photoshop for a while, you’re probably
aware that you can get the same result many different ways. This holds true
for getting rid of red eye as well. You
can use the regular old Brush tool with
a Color blend mode and paint away the
red. Or you can use the Color
Replacement tool with a black fore-
ground to color away the crimson.
Finally, you can use the Red Eye tool. 
Here’s a quick way to get the red out
and restore your image to a less
zombie-like look:
1. Open the original photo with red
eye showing.
I’m using a photo of an unhappy
angel, shown in Figure 3-13.
2. Select the Red Eye tool.
Using the default settings, click the
red portion of the eye in your
image, as shown in Figure 3-14.
This one click tool darkens the
pupil, while retaining the tonality
and texture of the eye.

3. If you’re not happy with the
results, tweak one or both of the
following options:
• Pupil Size: Use the slider to
increase or decrease the size
of the pupil.
• Darken Pupil: Use the slider to
darken or lighten the color of
the pupil.
4. If all goes well, your image is
now cured of the dreaded red
eye, as shown in Figure 3-15.
The Red Eye tool works only with RGB
or LAB color images. For details on
these color modes, see Book II.
Working with Vanishing Point
This awesome command enables you to make realistic edits in images with
perspective planes. With Vanishing Point, you specify the planes in your
images and then, by using a variety of techniques such as painting or
cloning, can add or eliminate objects on those planes. 
For example, say you have a building that has only one window on the side.
You have a remodeling project in mind where you would like to add more
light in the room, so you want to add three more windows on that side.
Using Vanishing Point, you can easily add those windows, all of which will
be scaled and angled by staying true to the perspective of the side of that
building. With Vanishing Point, you can now edit three dimensionally on a
two-dimension image. The resulting image is a nice composite to hand over
to your general contractor. No more funky cut and paste composites or
worse yet, indecipherable hand sketches over photos.
Besides editing flaws out or features into your digital photos, other great
uses for Vanishing Point are mocking up covers for books or DVDs, putting
graphics on various packaging containers.
Here are the steps for using this incredible feature:
Figure 3-15: The ultimate cure of red eye,
but not tears.

Working with Vanishing Point
641
1. Open an image that needs editing.
Creating a new layer is a good idea so that you can isolate your
Vanishing Point result from your original image layer. You have further
editing advantages if you want to change opacity settings, blend modes,
and so on. 
If you want only the Vanishing Point results to be applied to a specific
part of your image, be sure and make the selection (or add a mask)
before choosing the Vanishing Point command. 
If you need to paste an element into the Vanishing Point dialog box, be
sure and copy the item before choosing the Vanishing Point command.
This copied element can be from the same image or a different image.
It can also be a text layer.
2. Choose Filter➪Vanishing Point.
The Vanishing Point dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-16.

3. Grab the Create Plane tool. Click at each of the four corners of your
plane to establish your editing surface. Be as accurate as you can
when specifying the plane on your image.
A bounding box with nodes at each corner and a grid appears over the
plane surface, as shown in Figure 3-17. Feel free to tweak the plane to
perfection by moving or resizing the plane using the Create Plane or
Edit Plane tools. Photoshop informs you if your plane has a problem by
displaying a bounding box and grid as red or yellow. Adjust the bound-
ing box until it becomes blue. Move a corner node until the bounding
box and grid are blue, which indicates that the plane is valid. 
Figure 3-17: Define your editing plane with the Create Plane tool. 
4. Use the Grid Size slider to adjust the size of the grid units to better
line up the plane and grid with the elements that may be in your
image such as tiles, texture, windows, or doors. 
5. If desired, you can use the Create Plane tool and Ctrl+drag (Ô+drag on
the Mac) an edge node of the plane to “tear off” an additional plane. 
This simply means, for example, that you can extend the plane around to
another side, as I did in Figure 3-16, and create another plane. This keeps
the planes related to each other and ensures that your edit’s in the correct
scale and angle. Make sure you get your first plane exact, because once
you create an additional plane, you can no longer edit the first plane.

Working with Vanishing Point
643
No longer do your second planes have to be perpendicular! Version CS3
now enables you to tear off another plane and position it out at angle.
After creating your additional plane, grab either the Create Plan or Edit
Plane tool, press Alt (Option on the Mac), grab the center node on the
side opposite from your axis and swing it out at your desired angle.
Note that you can also enter a value, or slide the slider, in the Angle
option at the top of the Vanishing Point dialog box.
Note that at this point you can simply create perspective planes and
then click OK and bail out. The planes you established appear in the
future when you call up the Vanishing Point command again. 
6. After you establish your perspective planes, choose an editing task:
• Make a selection: Select the Marquee tool and drag a selection in
the plane, as I did in Figure 3-18. Specify your selection options,
either before or after the selection. You can feather the selection
to get soft edges. Or you can adjust the opacity of the selection.
You can also choose a Heal option. Move Mode allows you to
specify the selection as Destination or Source. Select Destination to
select the area you move the marquee to. Source fills an area with
the contents of the marquee when you move the marquee and
release. If you want to select your entire plane, just double-click the
Marquee tool.

• Clone: Select the Marquee or Transform tool and Alt+drag
(Option+drag on the Mac) the selection to create a copy of the selec-
tion. Transform (scale, rotate, move) the selection to your liking.
Clone as many times as you want. When you move the selection, it
adjusts to fit the perspective of the plane, as shown in Figure 3-19. 
Ctrl+Shift+T (Ô+Shift+T on the Mac) duplicates your last clone.
Note that you have access to multiple undos within the Vanishing
Point dialog box. But they are limited to your single editing session.
Press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to undo.
Figure 3-19: Your cloned selection conforms to fit the perspective of the destination plane.
• Move a selection: Grab the Marquee or Transform tool and drag the
selection. Press the Shift key to constrain the move. 
• Transform a selection: To scale the selection, select the Transform
tool and move the cursor on top of a node and drag. To rotate, move
the cursor next to a node until you see a curved double arrow. Then
drag in the direction of your desired rotation. Check the Flip or Flop
options to flip the selection horizontally or vertically. 
• Fill a selection with a piece of the image: With the Marquee tool,
Ctrl+drag (Ô+drag on the Mac) and make the selection you want as

the source image. You can also choose Source from the Move Mode
pop-up menu and drag the selection to the source image. You can
then move or clone the selection. If the selection needs to be scaled
or rotated, grab the Transform tool.
• Clone by stamping with part of the image: This technique works
exactly like the regular Photoshop Clone Stamp tool. With the Stamp
tool, Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) the area you want to define
as the source for your cloning. Then drag your mouse on the portion
of the image where you want the clone to appear. If you drag in a
perspective plane, the Stamp tool paints the cloned area in perspec-
tive. You can specify options for your brush diameter, hardness, and
opacity. Choose a Heal option. The Off option allows you to clone
without blending color, lighting, and shading of the surrounding
pixels. The Luminance option allows you to clone using the lighting
and shading of the surrounding pixels, but keeping the color of the
source (or sampled area). And finally, the On option enables you to
clone by blending color and lighting and shading of the surrounding
pixels. Select Aligned to sample pixels while maintaining the current
sampling point even when you release the mouse. Deselect this
option to sample pixels from the sampling point of each mouse click.
• Paint with color: Select the Brush tool and specify your options,
which are similar to the clone options. Click the Brush Color swatch.
Choose your desired color from the Color Picker and paint by drag-
ging on your image. As in stamping, the
brush size and shape adjusts to stay true
to the perspective.
• Paste a copied element from the clip-
board: Press Ctrl+V (Ô+V on the Mac) to
paste your element. With your Marquee
tool, position the element on your plane
where it adjusts to fit the perspective. 
• The Hand, Zoom and Measure tools are
for your measuring and navigation ease.
You can also access the magnification
pop-up menu and the plus and minus but-
tons at the bottom of the window.
7. Click OK.
No one will be the wiser that your composite
image, shown in Figure 3-20, doesn’t really exist in
the real world as we know it. Save your edited
image as a native Photoshop (.psd), TIFF, or JPEG

reparing images for the screen is a snap compared to what you have to
go through to get images ripe for the printing process. If all you ever
want to do is print your images to a desktop laser or inkjet printer, the task
is a little easier, but you still must take some guidelines into account. And
prepping your images for offset printing? Well, throw in an additional set of
guidelines. It’s not rocket science, mind you. If you stick to the
basic rules and, more importantly, spend some time develop-
ing a good working relationship with your service bureau
and offset printer, you’re good to go.
Getting the Right Resolution,

If you’re not familiar with the concept of resolu-
tion, I suggest taking a look at Book II, Chapter 1.
That’s where I cover all the basics on resolution,
pixel dimension, resampling, and other related
topics. For full descriptions on color modes and file
formats, see Book II, Chapter 2. That said, the next few
sections give you the lowdown on the proper settings for an
image that will ultimately go to print.
Resolution and modes
Table 1-1 provides some guidelines on what resolution settings to use for
the most common type of output. Remember these are just guidelines. They
aren’t chiseled into stone to withstand the sands of time or anything lofty
like that. You need to communicate with your service bureau, offset printer,
or client and get specifications and/or recommendations. (See the section,
“Working with a Service Bureau,” later in this chapter.)

Screen frequencies
For the appropriate resolution for color separations in Table 1-1, I list the
amount of 2 multiplied by the number of lines per inch. The lines per inch, or
lpi, pertains to the screen frequency of the output device. Screen frequencies
are measured in lines per inch in a halftone screen. You can also hear the
terms screen ruling or line screen. When images are printed, they are con-
verted into a series of dots called halftones. When you print your halftone,
you print it by using a halftone screen of a certain value. The average screen
frequency for printing four-color images is 133 to 175 lpi. Therefore, when
you multiply that by 2, you need to create your images by using a resolution
setting of 266 to 350 dots per inch (dpi).
File formats
As far as file formats go, what you choose depends on a couple of issues:

such as prints (of varying sizes) and slides. Mounting and lamination serv-
ices may also be provided. Many service bureaus provide scanning services,
including high-end drum scanning. A common service is taking scans or 
digital photos and burning them onto CDs or DVDs. Many service bureaus
provide output to color separations to film and RC paper. Larger bureaus
may even have a digital press to handle a short run (500 or less), on-demand

Getting the ball rolling
Developing a good working relationship with your service bureau and/or
offset printer can save you a lot of time, money, and frustration. These folks
are the experts and know their equipment and processes. And believe me,
they’re only too willing to help. The fewer problems they have with your
files, the better they like it. You can do some things to keep the relationship
on solid footing:
 Get a dialogue going about the specs: If your file is going directly to a
newspaper, magazine, or other publication, talk with the art director,
graphics production coordinator, or other knowledgeable person about
the graphic specifications required. Different service bureaus and offset
printers accept files from different applications and files of various 
formats.
 Build a lasting relationship: Consistency is also key. When you find a
good bureau or offset printer, stick with it for all your jobs. Jumping
from one company to another because a quote came in a little cheaper
doesn’t always pay off in the long run. If you’re a faithful customer,
often your service bureau or offset printer will match that lower quote
if it can. You don’t want to have to relearn what a new company can and
can’t do and vice versa. And if possible, try to let one company handle
your entire job. That way, one company controls the quality from begin-
ning to end, with no finger-pointing if things go bad.
 Get on the Web: Many service bureaus have Web sites where you can
find a listing of services they offer, price lists, file specs, and even down-
loadable order forms. Larger offset printers also have Web sites offering
general information and online requests for quote applications. Larger
offset printers may provide services such as scanning and film-separa-
tion output, so be sure to check the Web site for details.
Some file format warnings
If you save your file as an EPS or DCS and
reopen the file in Photoshop, Photoshop raster-
izes the vector data to pixels. Save the original
in the native PSD format.
If you save your layered file as an EPS, Photoshop
converts your vector type to clipping paths.
Extensive and small type creates complex clip-
ping paths, which can be time consuming and
sometimes difficult to print. You can either flat-
ten your file or deselect the Include Vector Data
option in the Save as EPS Options dialog box.
Either choice rasterizes the type into pixels at
the resolution of your image. You may want to
consider eliminating the type in your image file
and applying it either in a drawing or page
layout program that can retain vector type.

Working with a Service Bureau
653
Using a prepress checklist
In addition to communicating with your offset printers and service bureau,
you need to do some additional work to prepare your file for print. Here is a
handy checklist that you can use whenever you’re prepping a file for print.
Use it to ensure your file is ready and rarin’ for problem-free output. Note
that this list isn’t all-inclusive when it comes to prepress; I include tips that
pertain to Photoshop only.
 Always transform your images in their native application. Size, crop,
rotate, shear, and reflect art in Photoshop. Transforming images in an
illustration or page layout program is complex and can cause the RIP
(raster image processing, which converts objects to a series of
dots/pixels for printing) to take a long time to process the file.
 Ensure that images can first print from Photoshop. Do this before
importing the images into an illustration or page layout program.
 If you’re placing Photoshop EPS images into a page layout or illustration
program, set the halftone screen frequency in the destination program
instead of embedding it in each image in Photoshop. Or better yet, don’t
set any halftone screen frequencies in your images and let your service
bureau or offset printer handle setting them in the other program.
 When saving Photoshop images for print purposes, stick to TIFF, EPS,
native PSD, or PDF file formats. If you’re unsure of the proper format to
use for a specific job, ask your offset printer or service bureau for rec-
ommendations.
 Make sure that you have used the proper color mode. For example, use
CMYK for color separations and RGB for slide output. Again, if you’re not
sure, ask your offset printer or service bureau for recommendations.
 Create vector shapes and paths efficiently. Printing vector art involves
using intense calculations for every anchor point, and overly complex
paths can cause problems during the RIP process. Use the fewest number
of anchor points possible to create the path and delete any unnecessary
or stray points. Leave your flatness setting blank. Photoshop uses the
default setting for the output device, which is usually a safe bet.
 Limit the number of typefaces. Downloading takes time. Limiting the
number of typefaces also makes your document look more sophisti-
cated and polished. It is also a good idea to use good quality fonts from
established foundries. 
 Make sure that all scanning is at the appropriate dpi. As a general rule,
2 multiplied by the line screen (lines per inch or lpi) equals the dpi to
use in scanning the images. If you need to resize your image, be sure to
scan it at a higher resolution accordingly. For example, if you need it
twice as big, scan it at twice the final resolution needed. When scanning
line art, scan at a resolution of 1200 dpi or so to ensure a better black-
and-white image.

Chapter 1

Saving and Printing Vector Data in a Raster File
654
 If your image is to bleed (extend to the edge of the printed page),
take that into account when creating your image. Note that you need
to allow for 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 of an inch on any side that will bleed to allow for slip-
pages when the paper is cut.
 Always specify colors from a Pantone color swatch chart and then
select the color, whether process or spot, in Photoshop. Never trust
the way colors look on-screen because of calibration deficiencies and
differences between RGB and CMYK color models.
 Make spot color names consistent. Make sure that the Photoshop spot
color names exactly match those of any programs to which you are
importing your image, such as an illustration or page layout program.
Otherwise, you may get an additional color separation.
 Print and provide laser prints of your file, both separations (if war-
ranted), and a composite print. Print all with printer marks — crop
marks, registration marks, labels, and so on.
 Provide all fonts used in your file. Provide both screen and PostScript
printer fonts, if applicable. 
 Choose File➪Save As for your final save to squeeze down to the small-
est file size. Doing a Save As compresses your file as small as possible.
 Organize your files into folders. For example, put the image files
together in one folder, all the fonts in another, and so on. Practice good
file management and organization.
 Communicate any trapping needs to your service bureau or offset
printer. For color separations, indicate whether you have created the
trapping yourself or if you want the service bureau/offset printer to do it.
Saving and Printing Vector Data in a Raster File
Photoshop allows you to create vector shapes and vector type with the pen
tools, shape tools, and type tools (I explain how in Book III). Technically,
the vector shapes are clipping paths applied to a bitmap, or raster, layer.
But the clipping path is still a vector path, thereby retaining vector qualities.
This vector data is resolution independent, which means that it prints at the
resolution of the PostScript output device. Photoshop sends the printer
separate images for each type and shape layer, which are printed on top of
the raster image and clipped by using their vector paths. The edges of the
vector path print at the full resolution of the PostScript printer, but the con-
tents, such as the colored pixels or the image pixels within the vector path,
print at the resolution of the Photoshop file (all portions of the type are res-
olution independent). Therefore, type and shapes always have crisp, hard
edges, with curves appearing smooth and never jagged.

Choosing Color Management Print Options

Remember that the only file formats that allow you to retain vector data
are PSD, PDF, DCS, and EPS. When saving to DCS or EPS, be sure to select the
Include Vector Data option in their respective Options dialog boxes.
All other file formats rasterize the vector data.
Choosing Color Management Print Options
I highly recommend checking out the color management section in Book II,
Chapter 3. There I go into great detail on the concept of color spaces, ICC
profiles, and so on. Here, I cover the color management options you find in
the Print with Preview dialog box.
Different output devices operate in different color spaces. Monitors, desktop
printers, large format printers, film recorders, offset printers, and so on all
have their own unique color space. The color management options enable
you to convert the color space of your image while printing. So, for example,
if the ICC (color) profile of your image is sRGB, you can choose to have your
image’s color space converted to the color space of your Epson printer
when you print. 
Unfortunately, I can’t tell you what specific settings to choose. This choice is
a widely debated topic, and different printers have their strengths, short-
comings, and quirks. Some experts say to let your printer, especially if it is a
prosumer or professional-level printer, determine the colors, while others
say to let Photoshop handle the duties. My advice is to take an hour and a
pack of paper, run test prints to see which settings give you the most accu-
rate result, and stick with those. Try different color spaces for both Source
and Print Spaces and compare the printouts. You may even get different
results from different types of paper. 
When you have some free time, the following steps can help you experi-
ment with the Color Management settings and discover what print settings
work best:
1. Choose File➪Print to open the Print dialog box, shown in Figure 1-1. 
2. Choose Color Management from the pop-up menu in the top right of
the Print dialog box.
3. In the Print area, choose either Document or Proof.
Remember you’re experimenting. So choose one, and then try the other.
• Document uses the color profile of your image.
• Proof by default uses the color profile of your Working CMYK color
space, which you defined in your Color Settings dialog box. You can
change this profile, however, by choosing Current Custom Setup

from the Proof Setup Preset menu in the Options area. You can
define this custom option by first going to View➪Proof Setup. For
details on proofs, see Book II, Chapter 3.
Figure 1-1: Be sure and specify the settings in the Color 
Management portion of the Print dialog box.
4. In the Options area, choose a method of Color Handling.
The options differ depending on whether you chose Document or Proof
in Step 3.
If you chose Document in the Print area, here are your options:
• Printer Manages Colors sends the document unchanged to the
printer, tagged with its color profile. The printer driver then picks an
appropriate color profile and converts your document’s colors to
the final printout. Just make sure you enable color management in
your printer dialog box. 
• Photoshop Manages Colors tells Photoshop to handle the color con-
version, using the settings you choose from the Printer Profile and
Rendering Intent pop-up menus. Photoshop also checks whether or
not you selected the Black Point Compensation option with this set-
ting. If so, make sure you disable any color management in your
printer dialog box.
• Choose Separations if you want to print color separations (see the
upcoming section). 
• Choose No Color Management and no conversion occurs.
If you chose Proof in the Print area, you see the same options, but they
produce different results:

Getting Four-Color Separations
657
• Printer Manages Colors works only with a Postscript (PS level 2 or
higher) printer, which manages the color conversion of the proof
to the print based on your selection of Simulate Paper Color or
Simulate Black Ink. 
• Photoshop Manages Colors tells Photoshop to handle the color 
conversion of the proof to the print, using the printer profile speci-
fied in the pop-up menu and your choice of simulation. Unless you
have a lot of dark colors, I recommend leaving it on Simulate Paper
Color.
5. If you chose Photoshop Manages Colors, choose your printer and
paper type from the Printer Profile pop-up menu.
Although you may be able to change the Rendering Intent setting, 
I recommend leaving this at the default setting of Relative Colorimetric.
Also leave the Black Point Compensation check box at the default set-
ting of checked or unchecked (depending on your Color Handling
choice) — unless, of course, you’re a color guru and have a better
reason not to.
6. Unless you haven’t set your CMYK working space yet, you can leave
Proof Setup Preset as is. To set the working space, see Book II,
Chapter 3.
Proof Setup Preset reflects the working CMYK space you established in
your Color Settings dialog box, along with any custom presets you spec-
ified in the View➪Proof Setup➪Custom dialog box. 
7. When you finish making your selections, click Print. 
That’s all there is to it. If you want more information on printing, check
out Book I, Chapter 3. For more explanation on color management, see
Book II, Chapter 3.
If all you want to do is print color prints on your desktop printer, I recom-
mend starting off by choosing Document in the Print area and choosing
Photoshop Manages Colors for Color Handling. If you have a little time and
paper to burn, then print another copy by using Printer Manages Colors for
Color Space. Do a side-by-side comparison to see which one looks superior.
You can also crack the seal on the documentation that came with your
printer for any recommendations.
Getting Four-Color Separations
It is necessary to color separate your image whenever you plan to print your
image to an offset press. Your image must first be in CMYK color mode
(choose Image➪Mode➪CMYK Color). Then the composite color image gets
Book IX
Chapter 1
Prepping Graphics
for Print

Getting Four-Color Separations
658
digitally separated into the four-color channels — cyan, magenta, yellow,
and black — and is output. (These colors are also known as process colors.)
Sometimes, the separation output is onto film, and sometimes, it is output
directly to aluminum printing plates. The plates are put on an offset press,
paper runs through each of the four inked rollers (cyan first, then magenta,
yellow, and finally black), and out comes your composite image.
Getting laser separations
Before you take your image to a service bureau or offset printer to get color
separations, it is wise to get what are called laser separations. Basically, you
are color separating your image, not to film or plates, but to paper. 
If your image doesn’t separate to paper, most likely it won’t to film or plates,
either. You can go back and correct the problem, rather than pay upwards of
$80 to $150 an hour to have the service bureau or offset printer correct it
for you. Consider laser separations a cheap insurance policy.
Follow these steps to get laser separations from your desktop printer:
1. Be sure your image mode is CMYK. If it isn’t, choose
Image➪Mode➪CMYK Color.
I’m assuming your image is a four-color image. But it may also be a
grayscale, duotone, tritone, or quadtone image, in which case no conver-
sion to CMYK is necessary. (See Book II, Chapter 2, for more on modes.)
If you’re new to converting RGB images to CMYK, don’t be surprised if
your vibrant colors turn muddy and flat. This is because the gamut, a
fancy word for range of color, for CMYK is much smaller than it is for
RGB, and Photoshop converts colors that are out of the CMYK gamut to
their closest match. It’s a cold, harsh fact that we all have to live with.
After the conversion, you have an image with four channels — Cyan,
Magenta, Yellow, and Black, like the one shown in Figure 1-2.
2. Choose File➪Print. In the Print dialog box, select Color Management
from the pop-up menu in the top right of the Print dialog box.
3. In the Print area, select Document.
It should say U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2.
4. Select Separations from the Color Handling pop-up menu.
This option prints each channel from the image to a separate plate, or
in the case of laser separations, paper.
5. Select Output from the pop-up menu in the top right of the Print
dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-3. Then select additional options as
you desire.

Figure 1-3: When printing color separations, be sure and check 
the necessary options in the Output section of the Print dialog box.
For general print options, see Book I, Chapter 3. For additional options,
see Table 1-3.
Note that if you’re printing to a non-PostScript printer, some of these
options may not be available. You see a preview of most of these
options as you apply them to your file.
6. Click the Print button.
If all goes well, four pieces of paper, one for each of the four CMYK
channels, prints. If you’re printing a grayscale, duotone, tritone, or
quadtone image, you get one to four pieces of paper, one for each
color used. If that doesn’t happen, something’s amiss, and it’s time
for troubleshooting. Be sure to take these laser separations with
you when you hand over your file to the service bureau or offset
printer.

Creating Spot Color Separations
Photoshop allows you to add separate channels for spot colors (see Book VI,
Chapter 1, for more on channels), which can then be color separated. Spot,
or custom, colors are premixed inks manufactured by various ink compa-
nies, the most popular in the U.S. being Pantone. A spot color is often used
for a logo, type, or small illustration. Spot colors are also used when you
need to apply metallic inks or varnishes to your print job. Spot colors can
be used instead of, or in addition to, the four process CMYK colors. 
Book IX
Chapter 1
Prepping Graphics
for Print

Creating Spot Color Separations
662
If you are delving into the world of spot colors, I highly recommend that you
choose your color from a printed Pantone swatch book, available from
www.pantone.com. Because your screen is an RGB device and you’re set-
ting up your file for a CMYK output device, the colors you see on-screen do
not match the colors that are ultimately on paper and at best are a ballpark
match. For accuracy, you must select the colors from the printed swatch
book. For more on working with color, see Book II, Chapter 3.
Creating a spot channel
Follow these steps to create a spot channel:
1. Create the graphic or type to which you want to apply the spot color
on a separate layer.
2. Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) on the thumbnail of the layer to
select the graphic and then fill it with any solid color and an opacity
of 100 percent.
3. With your selection active,
choose Window➪Channels,
and choose New Spot Channel
from the Channels palette pop-
up menu.
You can apply a spot color only
to an active selection. It can’t be
applied just to a layer.
The New Spot Channel dialog
box appears, as shown in Figure 1-4.
4. In the Name text box, enter a name for your spot color. In the Ink
Characteristics area, click the color swatch.
I recommend naming it according
to the spot color you want to use,
such as Pantone 7417C.
When you click the color swatch,
the Color Picker appears.
5. Click the Color Libraries button
in the Color Picker and select
your Pantone color from the
Color Libraries dialog box that
appears (see Figure1-5). Then
click OK.
Figure 1-4: Adding an additional color
separation in Photoshop requires creating a
spot color channel first.
Figure 1-5: Select an appropriate color
from the Color Libraries dialog box

Creating Spot Color Separations
663
6. In the New Spot Channel dialog box, select a Solidity value between 0
percent to 100 percent.
A value of 100 percent represents
an ink that is completely opaque,
such as a metallic ink, which com-
pletely covers the inks beneath it.
A value of 0 percent represents a
transparent ink, such as a clear
varnish. But the solidity value
affects only the screen view and
composite prints; it doesn’t affect
the separations. It can be helpful
to see where a “clear” varnish
will print.
7. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Your spot channel appears in the
Channels palette and is filled in the
image as well. I created a spot
channel for my crest graphic and
for the sushiko type (Pantone
7417C), as shown in Figure 1-6.
In the printing process, spot colors
are overprinted on top of the four-
color image, as shown in Figure
1-7. That means that the spot color
is applied at the end of the print-
ing process and is printed over the
other inks. This can sometimes
cause lighter spot colors to darken
somewhat.
If you need your spot color
graphic to knock out the underly-
ing image, create it in an illustra-
tion or page layout program. A
knockout is when a hole is left in
the four-color image, and the spot
ink then fills that hole. It does not
print over the other inks.
8. Save the image in the native
Photoshop, Photoshop PDF, or
Photoshop DCS 2.0 (Desktop
Color Separations) format.

Figure 1-7: Spot colors are often used for
color critical logos that print on top of your

Creating Spot Color Separations
664
If the image is being separated directly out of Photoshop, leave it as a
PSD or PDF file. If you want to import it into a different program, such
as PageMaker, InDesign, or QuarkXPress, you must save it as a DCS file.
You also have to go through a few more hoops: If your image is a duotone,
tritone, or quadtone image, you must first convert it to multichannel
mode with the Image➪Mode command.
In the DCS 2.0 Format dialog box, make sure that the Include Halftone
Screen and Include Transfer options are not selected.
Import the image into your destination application and set your screen
angles.
Editing a spot channel
After you create a spot channel, you can edit it. Select the channel in the
Channels palette and use a painting or editing tool to paint with black, white,
or any shade of gray, just as you would with an alpha channel. To change
any of the options of the spot channel, double-click the spot channel thumb-
nail, or select it and choose Channel Options from the palette pop-up menu.
Choose a different color or solidity.
Converting an alpha channel to a spot channel
If you want to convert an alpha channel to a
spot channel, select the alpha channel in the
Channels palette and choose Channel Options
from the palette pop-up menu. Rename the
channel and select Spot Color. Choose a color
from the Custom section of the Color Picker.
Click OK. Note that Photoshop converts all
areas containing nonwhite pixels (unselected to
partially selected areas) to the spot color.
Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Invert to apply
the spot color to the white pixels or selected
areas of the alpha channel. For details on alpha
channels, see Book VI, Chapters 1 and 3.

T
he Contact Sheet II and Picture Package features are two
common tasks that are tedious to perform manually. You
can use these features to create documents of thumbnail
images of groups of files and print multiple copies of
an image on one sheet, much like the picture pack-
ages of 5 x 7s and wallet prints you order from
school photographers. Fortunately, the program-
ming wizards at Adobe have made creating con-
tact sheets and picture packages easy, and this
chapter leads you through the process.
Cataloging with Contact Sheets
If you’re not steeped in photographic darkroom lore
(and fewer of us are, in these digital days), the term contact
sheet might be fuzzy to you. The original purpose of contact
sheets was to show the photographer a small image of each picture in
a set of negatives so the photographer could compare the images, select
which ones to print, and crop them with a grease pencil right on the contact
sheet. Contact sheets also made a convenient way of filing away images.

Cataloging with Contact Sheets
666
Today, we have more sophisticated ways of previewing and cataloging digi-
tal images, including many different image-cataloging programs, such as
Adobe’s Bridge or Photoshop Elements application. Even so, the Contact
Sheet II automated tool in Photoshop works faster than database-type cata-
log programs (which require you to enter keywords to sort and locate
images) and performs useful tasks, such as the following:
 Prepare Photoshop documents so that you can store them, share them
with others in digital form, or print them for distribution.
 Create ad hoc catalogs adeptly. Just copy the files you want to include
to a folder and fire up the Contact Sheet II tool.
 Specify the number of rows and columns in your contact sheet, filling a
sheet with only a few images (if that’s what you want) or packing
dozens onto a single contact sheet.
 Automatically create multiple sheets if all the selected images don’t fit
on a single sheet.
Using Contact Sheet II
With Contact Sheet II, you can create contact sheets that have many thumb-
nail images on a single page. You can print the contact sheets or browse
through them electronically. To create a contact sheet catalog of your own
images, follow these steps:
1. Copy all the files you want to include in your contact sheet into a
folder on your hard drive.
2. Choose File➪Automate➪Contact Sheet II.
The Contact Sheet II dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-1.
Note that you can find both the Contact Sheet II and Picture Package
commands on the Tools➪Photoshop menu in Bridge. The Bridge makes
for easy and quick visual selection of images to catalog or package.
Check out Book I, Chapter 4, for more on Bridge.
3. In the Source Images area, click the Browse button (Choose on the
Mac) and navigate to the folder containing the images you want to
include.
From the Use pop-up menu, you can also choose Selected Images from
Bridge or Current open documents.
4. Select the Include All Subfolders check box if you want to include
images contained in a folder’s subfolders.

Cataloging with Contact Sheets
667
Figure 2-1: The Contact Sheet II dialog box allows you to specify 
dimensions, resolution, color mode and columns and rows for your 
contact sheet.
5. Choose your desired unit of measurement from the Units pop-up
menu. In the Width and Height boxes, enter the dimensions of the
contact sheet document.
Choose the default setting of 8 x 10 inches if you plan to print contact
sheets on standard-sized paper.
6. Adjust the resolutions settings.
A setting of 72 pixels/inch works well for contact sheets if all you want is
just a quick-and-dirty look at them. Use a higher resolution if you want a
sharper contact sheet. Remember, however that the file size will be larger.
If you’re showing the contact sheets to a client or you want the individual
images to look crisp and clear, choose a higher resolution. Also, if you
want the thumbnails to be larger (with fewer per page), choose a higher
resolution and adjust the number of columns and rows in Step 10.

settings.

7. Choose a color mode from the Mode pop-up menu.
RGB works best in most cases. However, if your images are black-and-
white photos, you can create smaller files by selecting the Grayscale
option.
Check your printer documentation to see the color mode recommended
for printing color images. For more on color modes, see Book II,
Chapter 2.
8. Select the Flatten All Layers check box if you want to create a contact
sheet with a single layer in which all images and their captions (if
any) are merged.
This option significantly reduces the contact sheet’s file size. If you do
not select this option, you end up with larger contact sheet files, but
you have the additional flexibility of flattening the thumbnails yourself
later both with and without captions.
You can now start adjusting the layout. A Preview window at the right
side of the dialog box shows roughly how the contact sheet will be 
laid out.
9. Select the Across First option from the Place pop-up menu to orient
the thumbnails in rows. Down First orients the layout in columns.
10. In the Columns and Rows text boxes, enter the number of columns
and rows.
Beneath the small layout preview on the right side of the dialog box are
the number of pages in your contact sheet, the total number of images,
and the largest possible size of each image.
If you plan to print such a maxi-thumbnail contact sheet, choose a
higher resolution (such as 150 to 300 pixels/inch) sharper thumbnails.
11. Choose the spacing you want between the images.
Select the Auto-Spacing option to have the default distance of .014
inches vertically and horizontally between each thumbnail option.
Deselect the option to enter a custom distance. Select the Rotate For
Best Fit option to have Photoshop rotate the thumbnails if necessary to
accommodate a better fit based on your specifications.
12. Choose the Use Filename as Caption option to identify each image
easily.
You can also select the Font and Font Size from the option lists.
13. Click OK to create your contact sheet. If you change your mind, press
the Esc key to quit.
Figure 2-2 shows a contact sheet with five rows and four columns.
Photoshop creates as many pages as necessary to include all the
selected images. This can take a few minutes.

Pretty as a Picture Package
If you remember having your class pictures taken as a child or have ever
gone to a retailer or professional photographer’s studio, then you have
probably seen the contact sheets that come from these photo sessions. You
purchase one of those special deals and wind up with, say, an 8-x-10-inch
print, two 5 x 7s, four 4 x 5s, and eight wallet-sized shots.
The number of pictures you get at each of these dimensions isn’t pulled out
of a hat. That’s the number of images at a given size that can fit on a single 
8-x-10-inch sheet of photographic paper.
Photofinishers have automated printers that can expose those duplicates
onto a standard-sized section of a roll of photographic paper, which is then
processed and cut apart by mechanized equipment.

Photoshop can perform much the same magic with your own photos, creat-
ing image documents that you can then print as your own picture packages.
This is much easier and faster than you cropping and pasting multiple copies
of images onto a single document. Just follow these steps to create your
own picture package:
1. Open the picture you want to use for your picture package in
Photoshop.
If you want to create multiple picture packages of different images using
the same parameters, copy the images to a single folder.
You have your choice of using files in a folder, an opened file, a specific
file, or selected files in Bridge.
2. Choose File➪Automate➪Picture Package.
The Picture Package dialog box, shown in Figure 2-3, appears. Again,
remember that you can also choose this command from within Bridge.
Figure 2-3: The Picture Package feature enables you to create print
layouts that rival professional photo studios.
3. In the Source Images area, select Frontmost Document to create the
picture package from the image that is currently selected in Photo-
shop, or choose File and select a single file from your hard drive.
Click Browse (Choose on the Mac) to navigate to files or folders.

Pretty as a Picture Package
671
If you select Folder to create picture packages from all the files in a
folder, all the picture packages must use the same parameters that you
enter in the Picture Package dialog box. You can also use images that
you have preselected from the Bridge.
4. If you’d like to include more than one picture in a picture package,
such as I have Figure 2-3, click a sample thumbnail in the Layout area
of the dialog box.
A Select an Image File dialog box appears.
5. Find the image you want to substitute and click it.
The image appears in the thumbnail you chose in Step 4.
6. Repeat to insert other images in the picture package.
7. Choose a setting for Page Size from the list.
In most cases, you’ll want to use 8 x 10 inches. You can also select 
10 x 16 inches or 11 x 17 inches if you have a printer that can handle
larger sheets of paper.
8. Choose a layout.
You can fill an entire sheet with only one size photo, if you like, such as
two 5-x-7-inch pictures or eight 2.5-x-3.5-inch pictures. Or you can select
one of the other combinations, such as two 4 x 5s, two 2.5 x 3.5s, or four
2-x-2.5-inch photos.
9. Adjust the resolution settings.
The default value is 72 pixels/inch. You’ll probably want a higher resolu-
tion, such as 300 pixels/inch if you plan to print the picture package.
Check your printer documentation to see the recommended resolution.
Also check out Book II, Chapter 1, for more on recommended resolution
settings.
10. Choose a color mode from the Mode pop-up menu.
RGB is the best choice in most cases. However, if your images happen 
to be black and white, you can create smaller, more compact picture
package files by selecting the Grayscale option. Check your printer 
documentation.
11. Select the Flatten All Layers check box to create a picture package
with a single layer in which Photoshop merges all images and their
labels (if you choose to apply them).
12. If you want to apply some text, you can do it in the Label area of the
dialog box.
Most picture packages don’t require text descriptions, but you can
choose content such as Filename, Copyright, Credit, and so on.

heart’s content. Use the Opacity drop-down list to adjust the type’s
opacity.
15. Click the Edit Layout button to further customize your layout.
In the dialog box, enter a name for your layout. Choose a size from the
Page Size menu or enter dimensions in the Width and Height boxes.
Choose a unit of measurement. In the Grid area, check the Snap To
option to show a grid to help position your image and then specify the
size of your grid increments. Click the placeholders, which may or may
not contain images, and drag them to your desired location within the
page. You can also reposition a placeholder by entering values in the X
and Y boxes. Drag a handle to resize the placeholder or enter dimen-
sions in the Width and Height boxes. Note that if you resize a place-
holder with an image in it, the image snaps within the placeholder. Click
the Add Zone button to add another placeholder. Click Delete Zone or
Delete All to delete placeholders. When you are satisfied with your
layout, click the Save button. 
16. Click OK to create the picture package. Within a few seconds, you’re
ready for printing.
Using the Photomerge Command
The Photomerge command allows you to combine multiple images into one
continuous panoramic image. For example, you can take several overlap-
ping photos of a mountain range and put them together into one panoramic
shot, as shown in Figure 2-4. 
Figure 2-4: The Photomerge command enables you to combine multiple images into one
continuous panoramic shot.

Using the Photomerge Command

If you know you ultimately want to create a Photomerge composition, you
can make things easier by making sure that when you shoot your photos,
you overlap your individual images by 15 to 40 percent, but no more than 70
percent. Adobe also recommends avoiding using distortion lenses (such as
fish-eye) and your camera’s zoom setting. Finally, try to stay in the same
position and keep your camera at the same level for each shot. Using a
tripod and rotating the head can help you achieve this consistency.
Here are the steps to assemble your own Photomerge composition:
1. Choose File➪Automate➪Photomerge.
Photoshop CS3 revamped the Photomerge command. Not only did they
rewrite the alignment algorithm, officially called Align by Content, for
better performance and improve the blending between source images,
they also enhanced, and simultaneously simplified, the feature itself.
You can also select your desired source images and choose Automate➪
Photomerge from the Bridge menu. Using Bridge is a timesaver because
you can quickly and visually select your images.
2. In the Photomerge dialog box, first choose your source files. You can
select from Files (uses individual files you choose) or from Folder
(uses all images in a folder) from the Use pop-up menu. Click the Add
Open Files to use all currently open files. Or click the Browse button
to navigate to your desired files or folder.
If you want to delete a file from the list, select it and click Remove.
3. Select Advanced Blending to correct the color differences that can
occur from blending images with different exposures. Photoshop
then blends the colors and tones. 
If Advanced Blending doesn’t help you, you can always create a blend-
ing group. First, in your Layers palette, create a new group containing
the layer you want to change. Next, change the group Blend mode to
Normal. Finally, add an Adjustment layer, such as Levels or Exposure, in
the group above the layer you want to change. 
4. In the Layout area, choose your desired project mode, as shown in
Figure 2-5. The thumbnail illustration visually demonstrates each
mode, but I’ll give you a little more description of each:
• Auto: Choose the Auto mode and Photoshop analyzes your images
on its own. 
• Perspective: Choose this mode if your images have been shot with
perspective, or at acute angles. This mode is also recommended for
High Dynamic Range (HDR) images. 
• Cylindrical: Choose this option if you shot your images with a wide
angle lens. This mode is also good for those 360 degree, full
panoramic shots.

Figure 2-5: Assemble images using the Interactive Layout mode.
• Reposition Only: With this mode, Photoshop will not take into
account any distortion, but merely scan the images and position
them in, what it considers, the best position.
If you choose any of the first four options, and then click OK, Photo-
shop marches off and attempts to automatically align and “stitches”
your source images into a new Photoshop image. Hopefully all will
go well, however if Photoshop can’t align and merge, it will come
back with an alert that “some images could not be aligned.”
• Interactive Layout: Choose this option and Photoshop will then
open the familiar, CS2-like, second window, shown in Figure 2-5. The
program will try and align and stitch the images the best it can, but
you may have to, or want to, manually complete or adjust the
merged image. If you chose the Interactive Layout option, proceed
to the Step 4.
Note that no matter which projection mode you choose, Photoshop
leaves your merged image in layers. In addition to those layers,
you’ll notice that a layer mask has also been added to each layer to
better blend and composite your merged image. These layer masks
act like any other layer masks, meaning you can edit them to your
liking. For more on layer masks, see Book VI, Chapter 3.
In Interactive Layout mode, to manually assemble your composition,
drag the image thumbnails from the lightbox area onto the work area
with the arrow. Or simply double-click on the lightbox thumbnail to add
it to the composition.
You can also drag an image back into the lightbox to remove it. In addi-
tion, you can reposition the images or rearrange their order also using
this same tool. Use the Rotate Image tool, the Zoom and Move View
(more commonly known as the Hand tool) tools, and the Navigator view
box to zoom in and out of your composition. See Book I, Chapter 5, if
you need more details on using these tools.

Using the Merge to HDR Command
675
CS3 now enables you to use keyboard shortcuts to zoom in and out.
Press Ctrl++ (Ô++ on the Mac) to zoom in and Ctrl+- (Ô+- on the Mac)
to zoom out.
Select the Snap to Image option to have Photoshop automatically snap
overlapping images into place.
5. To adjust the Vanishing Point, first select the Perspective option in the
Settings area. Then, click your desired image with the Set Vanishing
Point tool, which you can select from the Photomerge Tools palette
on the left.
Photoshop then changes the perspective of the composition. By default,
Photoshop selects the center image as the Vanishing Point (look for the
turquoise border). If needed, you can move the other images.
Note, however, that when you select the Perspective setting, Photoshop
links non-Vanishing Point images to the Vanishing Point image. To break
the link, click the Reposition Only setting button or separate the images
in the work area. You can also drag the Vanishing Point image back into
the lightbox.
6. Click OK to generate the merged image as a new Photoshop image.
Note that you can also click Save Composition to save the composite
as a .pmg (Photomerge format) file, which you can later open in the
Photomerge dialog box.
To open a previously saved composite (.pmg file), click the Open
Composition button in the Photomerge dialog box.
Using the Merge to HDR Command
Have you ever caught an early matinee and emerged mole-like from the
pitch black theatre into the bright light of high noon only to have to squint
for a while because your eyes burned? Or on the flip side, have you blindly
tumbled into your seat, popcorn scattering all over the aisle in that same
darkened theatre because you just came in from the bright daylight? In both
cases, your eyes needed some time to adjust to the abrupt change from
extreme dark to extreme light and vice-versa. Cameras suffer from the same
problem. But while our eyes can eventually adapt to varying brightness
levels, cameras and devices, such as computer monitors and scanners, can
only capture a fixed dynamic, or tonal, range. In digital imaging tech talk,
dynamic range is the ratio of the darkest and brightest values 
a device can capture simultaneously.
In the past, digital photography afficionados were hindered when perform-
ing higher-end image editing tasks in Photoshop because they were forced
to work within a limited dynamic range. Photoshop CS2 changed all that.

Using the Merge to HDR Command
676
And now, CS3 provides even greater support for High Dyanamic Range
(HDR) images. HDR images, which contain 32-bits of data per channel, are
superior because they can capture a much larger dynamic range — in fact
they are able to represent the entire dynamic range of the “real world.”
Photographers can now take multiple exposures of an image and then later
merge those multiple exposures into a single photo in Photoshop, thereby
capturing the entire dynamic range into a single HDR image. Although you
can use the Merge to HDR command on 8- or 16-bit images, be aware that
only 32-bit images can store all the HDR data.
Adobe offers a few tips to maximize your success with the Merge to HDR
command:
 Use a tripod when shooting multiple exposures of the same scene to
ensure you’re capturing the exact same shot each time. 
 Make sure you take enough shots to cover the entire dynamic range of
your subject. Shoot for a minimum of three, but try for five to seven, if
not more. 
 Vary the shutter speed to create different exposures, instead of your
aperture or ISO, which can cause noise, vignetting, and altering of depth
of field. 
 Make sure the exposure difference between the shots is one or two
Exposure Value (EV) steps apart. Use one or two f-stops apart as a guide.
 Don’t vary the lighting in the shots.
 Don’t shoot anything that is moving. The scene needs to be static.
Here are the steps to using this great new feature:
1. Choose File➪Automate➪Merge 
to HDR.
The Merge to HDR dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 2-6. 
Note that you can also access this
command in Bridge by choosing
Tools➪Photoshop.
Note that you can now even create
32-bit images via the File New
dialog box. Simply choose 32-bit
from the bit depth pop-up menu to
the right of the Color Mode pop-up
menu.
Figure 2-6: Choose two or more files to
merge in the Merge to HDR dialog box.

Using the Merge to HDR Command
677
2. Choose Files or Folder, from the Use pop-up menu. You can also
choose Add Open Files to use files that are currently open in
Photoshop. Just make sure that they have been saved first.
3. If you chose Folder or Files in Step 2, click the Browse button, select
the images, and click Open.
If you chose an image by accident, simply select it and click Remove.
4. Check Attempt to Automatically Align Source Images if you want
Photoshop to try and line up your various exposures.
Note that this is a good idea if you shot your photos without the use of a
tripod. Also note that your images need to be the same dimension and
resolution for this command to work.
5. Click OK. 
You may get a mini dialog box that asks you to manually set your expo-
sure value. You need to specify your Exposure Time, f-stop (aperture),
and ISO (film speed) for all your images.
A second dialog box appears with thumbnails of your chosen images on
the left and a large preview of the merged image in the center.
6. Based on how you like the merged image, you can select or deselect
any of the thumbnails in the source area by unchecking the check
box. 
Photoshop may bark at you that you don’t have enough dynamic range
to get a “useful” HDR image, in which case you have to bail out.
If you want to zoom in and out of your images, click the – and + buttons
or use the View pop-up menu at the bottom of the Preview window.
7. In the Bit Depth menu, shown in Figure 2-7, choose your desired bit
depth for the merged image. Be sure and leave your 32-bit image set
to 32-bit if you want to capture and store the entire dynamic range. 
8. Use the White Point slider to set the white point for the merged image
if you want to see a better preview.
The dynamic range of HDR images surpasses what your monitor can
show. So when viewing them, they can look pretty nasty — too dark and
undersaturated. If you adjust the preview with the White Point slider,
Photoshop provides a better display of the image without altering the
image data at all. Remember that if your image is 32-bit, adjusting the
white point only affects the preview, not the actual image data. That pre-
view adjustment is then saved in the HDR file and applied whenever the
file is opened in Photoshop. But, if your image is 16- or 8-bit, adjusting
the white point applies the adjustment to the actual image data itself.

9. Choose either an Automatic or saved (which you need to load)
Response Curve.
10. Click OK.
Your merged HDR image appears in all its full dynamic glory.
Even if you want to ultimately convert your 32-bit image to 16-bit or
even 8-bit, always make your exposure and contrast corrections first
and then convert it. You’ll get your dynamic range the way you want it.
Once you click OK, the HDR Conversion dialog box will appear. Choose
your desired method from the pop-up menu. Exposure and Gamma
adjust the brightness and contrast of the image. Highlight and compres-
sion compresses the highlight values so they fall within the tonal range
of an 8- or 16-bit image. If you choose Local Adaptation, click the tri-
angle to expand the Toning Curve and Histogram, where you can make
adjustments to the curve. For more on the dynamics of curves, see
Book VIII, Chapter 1. Note that you can also choose Image➪Mode➪
16-bits or 8-bits/channel and your exposure and contrast adjustment 
in the same HDR Conversion dialog box.

If you’re the inquisitive type, you may be interested to learn that CS3
now uses the new Align by Content algorithm to create the merged
image instead of the old Photomerge algorithm. This should give you
better results when merging HDR files. Everyone, inquisitive or not,
should be pleased to discover that CS3 has given us the opportunity to
now have layers within a 32-bit images. This, of course, opens up a
whole world of creative possibilities with the ability for multiple image
compositing. You can also apply another half dozen or so additional
blend modes on those layers, including Hue, Saturation and Color. As an
added bonus, this new version enables us to paint on those 32-bit
layers, as well as add type. You can have your way with the following
tools: Brush, Pencil, Pattern Stamp, Eraser, Gradient, Blur, Sharpen,
Smudge and Type. Finally, don’t be surprised to encounter a different
Color Picker when choosing a color for an HDR image. With its elevated
status in CS3, HDR images now have their very own Color Picker. That
being said, at press time for this book, however, it wasn’t crystal clear
whether HDR layer, painting and color picking capabilities would only
be available in the Extended version of Photoshop. If it is and you don’t
have the Extended version, my apologies. It may be worth an upgrade if
you’re a big HDR image user.
Note that if you copy a layer, selection or entire image from an 8-bit or
16-bit file you will encounter a profile mismatch due to differences in the
gamma values in the color profiles. You’ll want to convert your profile to
match your HDR image. For more on color profiles see Book II, Chapter 3.
Creating PDF Presentations
The PDF Presentation command allows you to use multiple images to create
a single, multipaged document or slide show. This feature is great for several
reasons. First, your recipient doesn’t need to have any specific hardware,
software, utilities, or fonts to open and view the presentation. All that is
required is Acrobat Reader, a free download from www.adobe.com. In addi-
tion, sending a single file containing multiple images is a great way to share
your photos with family and friends. You avoid the hassle of having to e-mail
your images as separate attachments. Finally, the PDF format offers excel-
lent compression, thereby squeezing your file size down significantly with-
out sacrificing image quality. Just be sure and check your final file size so
you don’t choke your recipients’ e-mail inboxes!
Follow these steps to create a PDF Presentation:
1. Choose File➪Automate➪PDF Presentation.

Note that you can also access the PDF Presentation in the Bridge by
choosing Automate➪PDF Presentation. Note that if you do not select
any images, the command selects all the images displayed in Bridge.
2. Click the Browse button and navigate to your desired files. If you
want to add the files you already have open in Photoshop, select the
Add Open Files option. You can also Duplicate any file in the list.
Remove files from the list by selecting them and clicking the Remove
button. You can also reorder the files by dragging them up and down
the list.

3. Choose either a Multi-Page Document or a Presentation (slide show).
A multi-page document displays each image on a separate page.
Note that the PDF Presentation command preserves any notes added
with the Notes tool. In addition, Photoshop reimports a multipage docu-
ment or PDF presentation file with comments that have been added in
Acrobat. This is a great tool for presenting projects to clients or man-
agement and receiving feedback from those recipients.
4. Choose your desired Background color from the pop-up menu.
Choices include White, Black or Gray.
5. You may now choose to include metadata such as filename, a descrip-
tion, and EXIF Info (info from your camera). You can also add any
annotations that you added to your original source files. Choose your
desired Font Size from the pop-up menu. If you choose to display
metadata, a border appears around the images and the text will
appear underneath the image. For more on metadata and annota-
tions, see Bonus Chapter 3 on the Web.
6. If you selected Presentation in Step 3, specify your presentation
options.
• Advance Every [5] Seconds: Establishes how long each image
appears on-screen. You can change the default of 5 seconds.
• Loop After Last Page: Enables the presentation to continually run. If
not selected, the presentation stops after the last image.
• Transition: From the pop-up menu, choose how you want one image
to transition to the next.
7. Click Save.
8. In the Save dialog box, provide a name and location for your presen-
tation. Click Save.
9. In the Save Adobe PDF dialog box, shown in Figure 2-9, specify your
desired options.
For details on the options in this dialog box, see Book II, Chaper 2.
10. Click OK.
Photoshop creates your PDF Presentation and prompts you with a mes-
sage that it was successfully created, if indeed it was. If you didn’t
choose the View PDF After Saving option in Step 9, launch Acrobat or
Acrobat Reader and view your presentation. Figure 2-10 shows an image

reparing an image for display on a Web page can be just as important
as creating it. That razor-sharp, 6-megapixel image you carefully com-
posed through the viewfinder of your digital camera may end up cropped,
sliced, and transformed into a miniature 128-x-128-pixel graphic perched in a
corner of your Web page. Visitors to your site are likely to be more concerned
with how quickly the image downloads and how clearly they can view its
content than its glorious digital genesis.
Photoshop has some marvelous tools for optimizing an image
for the Web, but you can (and should) prepare your images
ahead of time as well. This chapter introduces you to
some of the tools and concepts you need to be familiar
with before you start optimizing in earnest. And then
after you do all your prep work, you can optimize
them so they look their very best, download their
fastest, or some combination of the two. In most
cases the Save for Web & Devices feature provides
the kind of automation and preview capabilities you
need right inside Photoshop itself. But if you need
some additional horsepower, you can jump to a pro-
gram like Dreamweaver or Fireworks for its unique
Web features.

Understanding Basic Web Optimization

Understanding Basic Web Optimization
When you’re creating images for the Web, you get best results if you choose
a Web-friendly resolution, color mode, and file format that’s appropriate for
the image you want to display. I introduce these concepts for both Web and
print in Book II. The following sections offer an overview of basics to con-
sider when preparing images for the Web.
Choosing a resolution
If you’re planning on putting images on the Web, follow these two golden
rules:
 Start out by creating the image at the resolution you’ll use to display
it. Images can lose detail when you change the resolution settings after
editing. The quality loss isn’t as visually noticeable when downsampling
(reducing resolution) as when upsampling (increasing resolution). See
Book II Chapter 1 for details on image resolution. 
 Choose the resolution based on what will look good on the average
17-inch screen with resolution settings of 800 x 600, as shown in
Figure 1-1. Most Web sites use this standard display. You don’t need a
high resolution or larger pixel dimensions to display the image on a
Web site, unless your audience is very sophisticated and you know they
all use 21-plus-inch monitors. 
Figure 1-1: Use a resolution setting of 800 x 600 pixels for a 
standard Web image.

Understanding Basic Web Optimization BC3
Picking a resolution (and sticking with it)
Changing resolution is often bad because you always lose some image detail
when you convert from one resolution to another while resizing images.
Therefore, creating a graphic destined for the Web at the resolution that
you’ll use to display it is a good idea. If possible, do not create the image at
a different size and change the resolution later.
So, when choosing the resolution and size of your images, keep in mind the
final destination of the image — that is, Web or print — and how large you
want it to appear on the screen or printed page.
Smaller monitors display images at 72 ppi. Larger monitors may use 96 ppi
or 120 ppi. You can use these figures to visualize the size your images will
appear on the displays of other users’ computers. For example, a graphic
that measures 150 pixels x 150 pixels appears to be about 1.25 x 1.25 inches
on a monitor with 120 ppi resolution (rather tiny), but a little more than 2 x
2 inches (relatively large) on a smaller monitor with 72 ppi resolution. I tend
keep it simple and just use a standard setting of 72 ppi.
Resolution values always translate into sizes. For example, a Photoshop image
measuring 600 x 600 pixels created at 600 dpi prints as a 1-x-1-inch square on
a 600 dpi printer because each pixel is translated into one printer dot, or as a
2-x-2-inch square on a 300 dpi printer (unless you tell the printer to scale the
image to a different size) because each pixel translates into two printer dots.
Selecting a color mode
In Web graphics terms, color mode refers to the number of colors or grays
that appear in an image. Color modes for the Web, which I introduce in
Book II, Chapter 2, include the following:
 Grayscale: Up to 256 different gray levels
 Indexed Color: 256 or fewer colors
 RGB: Up to 16.7 million different colors created from red, green, and
blue values
In practical terms, only Grayscale, Indexed Color, and RGB are used for the
Web because they’re the only modes supported by the two most popular
Web-capable image file formats, GIF and JPEG (which I describe later in this
chapter). 
The color mode you choose affects how your image is displayed. Modes of
256 (or fewer) colors are great for images that contain a limited number of
hues, but not for the display of images that call for full color. But if you use
Bonus

Choosing the Right File Format
BC4
RGB color mode with full-color images, they frequently (but not always)
produce larger files that take a long time to download. For reasons like
these, you have to make tradeoffs when selecting the right mode. Fortunately,
the Save for Web feature (see Book IX, Chapter 2) enables you to compare
the different modes and make a wise decision.
However, you can still work with colors manually, as you find out later in
this chapter.
Understanding file formats
Web browsers can display images in several ways. The fastest, easiest, and
most compatible solution is to use graphics that the majority of browsers
can display natively, in-line (that is, consecutively with text). 
Except for some browsers that display only text, the most commonly used
browsers can handle only files saved in GIF (Graphics Interchange Format),
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), and, in some cases, PNG
(Portable Network Graphics) formats.
Browsers can display other types of images if users have installed the
appropriate helper applications or plug-in. For example, if you’re browsing
and click a link that leads to a PDF (Portable Document Format) file, your
browser can display the file if you’ve installed the Adobe Acrobat Reader
plug-in and the Adobe Acrobat Reader application. Flash animations are
another kind of image that requires a plug-in to view. However, formats
other than GIF, JPEG, and PNG are beyond the scope of this book. 
Choosing the Right File Format
All you really need to know about file formats is how to choose between
GIF, JPEG (or JPEG 2000), and PNG. The following sections discuss each of
the major formats and run down all the advantages and disadvantages to
using them. 
You can save your files in any of these formats using the Save for Web &
Devices feature, with the exception of JPEG 2000. So I cover saving as JPEG
2000 here, but see the later section about Save for Web & Devices to use the
other formats mentioned here.
GIF pros and cons
GIFs, introduced in Book II, Chapter 2, are great for images that don’t con-
tain many colors, like line art. They produce smaller files by discarding

Choosing the Right File Format BC5
some colors, if necessary, to produce a
file that has a maximum of 256 differ-
ent colors as shown in Figure 1-2.
When an image’s colors are reduced to
meet this maximum or further trim file
size, similar colors are combined into
fewer hues, or represented by a pat-
tern of similar colors (called dithering)
that the eye merges into an approxima-
tion of the original range of colors.
Although reducing the number of
colors in a full-color image can occa-
sionally produce an artistic effect, in
most cases you must reduce colors
with care. Table 1-1 outlines the pros
and cons of GIF images.
The kind of compression used for GIF
files is called lossless compression
because the image can be uncom-
pressed and reconstructed exactly as
it was before compression. Of course,
information is lost when colors are dis-
carded prior to compression (when
you optimize the number of colors).
For more about reducing the number
of colors before data compression, see
the later section, “Using a Web-Safe Palette and Hexadecimal Colors.”

Choosing between GIF and JPEG file formats
Knowing the differences between GIFs and
JPEGs helps you make your images more suit-
able for one format or the other. Here are some
tips for getting the most from these file formats:
 Make a better GIF. Modify your image so
that it contains larger areas of a single
color; reduce unneeded colors manually
(you know what they are better than the
Save for Web & Devices tool knows); con-
vert anti-aliased lines to solid lines where
possible.
 Make a better JPEG. Decrease the color
saturation, if possible, of your image. Lower
the contrast, if you can do so without sacri-
ficing quality. Blur unimportant areas if fea-
sible (although it usually isn’t). The JPEG
algorithms do a better job on low-saturation,
low-contrast, not-as-sharp images than on
vivid-color, high-contrast, or sharp images.
But remember, it’s your call. Choosing
between great compression/small size and
better quality should depend on your con-
tent and your audience.

objectionable bands of color in 
GIF format.
GIFs can be interlaced. In this process, every 
eighth line is displayed as the file downloads, 
displaying a rough image immediately. The other 
lines are filled in until the full image is available.
Interlacing is mostly useful to visitors who have 
slow connections. Virtually all graphics-capable 
browsers can display interlaced GIFs, but not all 
can display interlaced PNG or Progressive 
(JPEG’s flavor of interlacing) JPEG images.
GIFS can contain transparent areas. You can make 
a single color transparent to the browser so that 
the underlying background shows through. This is 
a great feature for creating “floating” images.
GIFs can be animated. Browsers display multiple 
GIF images consecutively as animations, which is 
a great feature if you avoid huge animations that 
take a while to download.
Always compare the file size of GIF and JPEG images by using the Save for
Web & Devices feature to see which format provides the smallest file. Of
course, when you compare the file size, you should also compare the image
quality. After all, the proof is in the pudding.
JPEG pros and cons
The JPEG format, which I introduce in Book II, Chapter 2, was developed
somewhat later than GIF in response to the need for a file format that pro-
vides smaller images without sacrificing all the colors found in true photo-
graphic images.

Choosing the Right File Format BC7
The JPEG format reduces file sizes by
using a somewhat different scheme
than GIF, a type of lossy compression
that discards some image information
as the image is squeezed down. Each
image is divided into 8-x-8-pixel blocks,
the pixels in those blocks are analyzed,
and the pixels that are similar in color
are combined. The color information
for the pixels that are merged is dis-
carded, producing an image that has
less detail than the original, but is still
a good representation of all the colors
it contained. As a result of this
process, JPEG images have that dis-
tinctive blocky look when you zoom in
on them in Photoshop, as shown in
Figure 1-3.
You can choose the amount of com-
pression the JPEG uses and, therefore, the tradeoff between file size and
sharpness. The Save for Web command, which I cover later in this chapter,
helps you decide how to make the tradeoff for individual images.
Table 1-2 outlines the advantages of the JPEG format, which are in many
cases nearly identical to those of the GIF format.

they’ll still see the image.
Editing JPEGs isn’t a good idea because each time you save a JPEG file, addi-
tional image data is lost due to lossy compression. Work with an original
TIFF or PSD file and save it as a JPEG when you finish editing it. If you need
to make additional changes, return to the original TIFF or PSD file.
JPEG 2000 pros and cons
JPEG 2000 is a fairly new addition to Photoshop’s list of file formats. It is a
derivative of the standard JPEG format but offers additional enhancements.

Saving a file as JPEG 2000
If you decide that the positives outweigh the negatives, follow these steps to
save a JPEG 2000 file. Note that the following options save the file in extended
JPEG 2000 (JPF) format. There is also a standard or minimal JPEG 2000
format (JP2).
1. Click the Save button.
The JPEG 2000 dialog box, shown in Figure 1-4 appears.
Figure 1-4: The JPEG 2000 format offers many advantages over JPEG, but unfortunately
requires a plug-in for previewing on the Web.
2. In the dialog box, select from the following options:
• File Size: You can enter a value to set a target size for the saved file.
The Quality value adjusts automatically to the best quality for your
specified size. 
• Lossless: Select this setting to compress the image without quality
degradation, but create a larger file. If deselected, you can drag the
Quality slider to specify a quality setting. Higher values result in
better quality but a larger file. But, if you select a quality setting that
is inconsistent with your target file size, the File Size changes.

• Fast Mode: This option allows for faster previewing or encoding of
the file. But just be forewarned that Fast Mode doesn’t support the
options of file size control, progressive optimization, or lossy encod-
ing with an integer or wavelet filter.
• Include Metadata: Select this option to include file information.
Leaving this option deselected produces a smaller file.
• Include Color Settings: Select this option to include ICC profile data,
which I introduce in Book II, Chapter 3. Leaving this option dese-
lected produces a smaller file.
• Include Transparency: This setting preserves any transparency in
the image. 
• JP2 Compatible: Select this option to create a file that can be dis-
played in an application that supports standard or minimal JPEG
2000 format but does not support extended JPEG 2000 format. 
3. Click the Advanced button to access the following options. When
you’re done selecting options, click OK:
• Compliance: Chooses various devices that support this format.
Right now only general devices, like browsers, are supported.
• Wavelet Filter: Specifies the type of numbers used to encode the
file. Integer is a good overall option for providing good image 
quality. Float is more accurate, but you can’t use it with lossless
compression. Float may also cause some degradation around the
edges of an image.
• Tile Size: Specifies the size of the tiles used in the image. Use 1024 x
1024 for a good overall size. If you create a really small image, use a
lower size. 
• Metadata Format: Saves various data with the image. JPEG 2000
XML is a format specific to XML data, XMP is File Info data, and EXIF
is digital camera data. 
• Color Settings Format: Includes color settings data in the image file.
The ICC Profile format option includes the ICC profile specified in
the Save As dialog box. The Restricted ICC Profile option saves a
restricted profile used for portable devices, such as cellphones and
PDAs. This profile is for the JP2 format only. 

Choosing the Right File Format BC11
4. Back in the JPEG 2000 dialog box, specify the Optimization order.
Your choices include the following: Growing Thumbnail produces
a sequence of small thumbnails that get larger until they reach the
image’s full size. Progressive creates an image that gradually displays
increasingly detailed versions of the image. Note that Progressive
JPEGs are large in file size and aren’t supported by all applications.
Color displays the image as a grayscale image first and then as a color
image. 
5. If your image contains one or more alpha channels (saved selections),
define a Region of Interest if you wish by selecting the alpha channel
from the Region of Interest pop-up menu. Then choose an Enhance
value to increase or decrease the quality of the Region of Interest rel-
ative to the rest of the image. 
Be warned that by enhancing the area inside the region, the area outside
the region decreases in quality in order to leave the file size the same.
After the alpha channel is used, it’s deleted when the file is completely
saved.
6. To preview the download rate, choose a download rate from the pop-
up menu and click Preview. 
The estimated download time is displayed in the bottom-left corner of
the dialog box if you select the JP2 Compatible option in the JPF
Settings area. 
7. When you’re done, click OK.
PNG pros and cons
When will PNG ever get its day in the sun? I’ve been writing about the PNG
(often pronounced ping) format seemingly forever (actually, only since 1995
when the PNG standard was frozen). Every year, support for the PNG format
grows, but its actual usage remains pitifully small.
The chief roadblock has been a lack of browsers that support PNG fully, but
that roadblock has largely vanished. (The vast majority of browsers in use
today support at least some PNG features.)

Chapter 1

Graphics

BC12
Later versions of Internet Explorer support PNG natively; older versions
may require a plug-in, which can be irritating to viewers of your Web page.
In the Mac realm, support is good in IE, Firefox, and Safari. Although Web
developers are a cautious lot and want the largest group of people possible
to view their efforts, the main reason today that so few people use the PNG
format is that so few other people use it.
That’s a pity, because the PNG format is a potential GIF-killer. (It can give
JPEG a run for the money, too, but it’s not specifically designed to repro-
duce photographic-quality images.) The features built into the PNG format
counter most of the objections to GIF. Because of that, the advantages
greatly outweigh the disadvantages. So, I focus on the advantages:
 It’s free. Unisys holds the patent on the compression algorithm used in
GIF and charges a royalty to any software vendor who wants to create
software applications that write GIFs. The PNG specification is a poten-
tial advantage because software developers can incorporate it into
products without paying for the privilege.
 It offers better compression. The PNG format produces files that are up
to 20 percent smaller than the equivalent GIF, but they sometimes can
be larger. In fact, one disadvantage is that they can sometimes be larger
than the equivalent JPEG file.
 It isn’t limited to 8-bit, 256-color images. In fact, the PNG format isn’t
limited to 24-bit, 16.7 million color images. It can support a selected
range of bit depths from 1 to 64 bits, for zillions and zillions of colors.
The bottom line is that the PNG format supports Grayscale, Indexed
Color, and RGB modes.
 It uses a smarter interlacing scheme. The PNG format provides images
that fade in faster and better than interlaced GIFs.
 It offers four different types of transparency. The PNG format allows
64 to 254 (not 256) different levels of transparency, so even full-color
images can float over a background, as shown in Figure 1-5.
The PNG format also offers some technical advantages that aren’t readily vis-
ible to the user, such as the ability to adjust for variations in the display of
images by certain devices (called gamma correction) and an error-correction
routine that patches images that have lost a bit or two in transmission to
your computer.
The PNG format does not support animation. A related file format, MNG
does, but it’s used even less widely than PNG.

Using a Web-Safe Palette and Hexadecimal Colors
If you’ve tinkered with HTML, then you’ve probably at least heard of hexa-
decimal colors. Photoshop’s Web-safe palette is a set of 216 colors that
should, theoretically, be displayed by any browser, regardless of whether
the user’s video card displays 256 hues, 16.7 million, or something in
between. Using only these Web-safe colors is a way to ensure that your
image is represented without dithering in any browser.
Of course, who views Web pages on a display using only 256 colors these
days? Haven’t all computers been furnished with video cards offering a mini-
mum of full 24-bit, 16.7-million-color images for ages and ages and ages?
Well, not exactly.
You may be working with 256-color images in some instances:
 You’re using GIFs. Oops! GIFs always have 256 or fewer colors, even
when you’re displaying them on a full-color monitor.

Using a Web-Safe Palette and Hexadecimal Colors
BC14
 A visitor is using a computer on which resolution is more important
than the number of colors. Users who don’t edit graphics may need
1600-x-1200-pixel resolution on their large-screen displays and not care
that their older video cards offer only 256 colors at that resolution.
 Your visitor is using a PDA, Web-capable cellphone, or some similar
device. Their LCD displays don’t support more than 256 different
shades. If your Web page needs to reach these people, consider a Web-
safe palette for at least some of your images.
In all these cases, you may need to use the Web-safe palette features to opti-
mize your colors. If you’re going to make a wholesale conversion of the
colors in an image to a Web-safe palette, you’re better off using the Save for
Web & Devices feature, which is automated and provides visual feedback of
your results.
Selecting individual Web-safe colors
Photoshop lets you select individual colors based on their Web-safeness.
You can do that two ways:
 Selecting the Only Web Colors
check box in the Color Picker, as
shown in Figure 1-6.
If you don’t select the Only Web
Colors check box, the Adobe Color
Picker still lets you know when you
select a nonsafe color. A small
cube appears above the selected
color patch in the dialog box (to
the left of the Custom button).
 Selecting Make Ramp Web Safe in
the Color palette from the palette
options menu.
See Book II, Chapter 3 for details on using either of these features with Web
safe colors.
So what are hexadecimal colors?
Hexadecimal colors are simply a way of representing hues in the notation
used by computer programmers. Hexadecimal values are calculated by
using the digits 0 to 9 and the letters A through F. Fortunately, you don’t
need to bother with the math. You just need to know that a hex value from
00 (no color) to FF (maximum color) represents the 256 shades of red,
green, and blue.
Figure 1-6: Web safe colors help ensure
that your color displays consistently across
all browsers.

Keeping Color Consistent in Web Images BC15
For example, a value of F0306F might represent a deep rose color. This cryptic
value can be broken into three parts: Red — F0 (240 in decimal); Green —
30 (230 in decimal); and Blue — 6F (111 in decimal). The hex numbers are
handy because you can enter them into HTML text to reproduce the color.
You can read the hexadecimal values of a selected color in the Info palette
and use the same values to specify that color in any dialog box (such as the
Adobe Color Picker) that accepts them. You are also likely to use these
values when you use HTML or another markup language to specify the text
and background colors on your Web page or Web site.
Keeping Color Consistent in Web Images
Although getting color consistent and optimal is probably more challenging
for print, you need to consider a couple issues for the Web as well. First,
your images will be viewed on a wide variety of monitors, operating sys-
tems, and computer platforms. This alone causes the images to display 
differently. In addition, many Web browsers do not take into account an
image’s embedded ICC profile (see Book II, Chapter 3). Raw RGB color data
is all that displays. So again, how your image is viewed depends on the
viewer’s computer system/monitor. Some of the things you can do to help
remedy the situation are the same things you do for working with color for
print, and a couple are unique:
 Set up the optimum image-editing environment. Keep your desktop a
neutral gray, eliminate distracting surroundings, and so on. Find more
details about setting up your environment in Book II, Chapter 3.
 Calibrate your monitor! Set your monitor to its optimum viewing
state and keep it that way. I describe calibration in detail in Book II,
Chapter 3.
 Establish your color settings. I recommend that if you’re cranking out
lots of Web images to use the Web Graphics Defaults as your setting.
This setting enables you to produce images in the sRGB color space and
increases the chances that your images display correctly and consis-
tently. I cover color management detail in, you got it, Book II, Chapter 3.
 Convert any non-sRGB profiled documents you have to sRGB. To do
this, choose Edit➪Convert to Profile. Select sRGB in the Destination
Space area.
 Finally, use the Save for Web & Devices feature to save all your Web
images. This way you have more control over how your images are opti-
mized. You can choose how many colors are displayed, what palettes
are used, and so forth.

Making Type Look Good On-Screen
BC16
Making Type Look Good On-Screen
The last thing you may want to consider when prepping your images for the
Web is how your type looks. You can make changes as you prepare or edit
the image that affect how well your type shows up on-screen. The following
sections describe some of your options.
Anti-aliasing
Depending on your typeface and the size, you may or may not want to apply
anti-aliasing. Photoshop offers five different anti-aliasing methods:
 None uses no anti-aliasing. Although it depends on the
font, this choice is often a good choice for small type.
A few fonts are specifically designed for use without
anti-aliasing. When used with anti-aliasing turned on, these fonts look
atrocious.
You may want to check out Pixel fonts. They are a
newer breed of fonts designed specifically for Web display, especially 
at smaller sizes, used at a specific point size.
 Sharp applies only enough anti-aliasing to soften
the edges of diagonal strokes, keeping the type
quite sharp. This is another sensible choice for
smaller type.
 Crisp increases the amount of anti-aliasing a bit, but
the type still looks fairly sharp.
 Smooth provides the maximum amount of anti-
aliasing but can slightly affect the sharpness of the
type.
 Strong gives the type a heavier appearance.
Although these recommendations usually hold true, your
results may vary depending on specific typeface and size; you may want to
experiment in some cases.
Fractional width/system layout
At small sizes and low resolutions, such as those typical of Web display,
type can be rendered inconsistently with the default Photoshop type setting
of Fractional Widths. In this mode, Photoshop varies the distance between
characters by using fractions of whole pixels. At sizes smaller than 20 points,
such type may either have too much space between characters, or not
enough space, causing the characters to run together.

Optimizing Images with Save for Web & Devices BC17
To prevent this, choose System Layout from the Character palette options
menu. System Layout displays text as the operating system would by using a
program, such as WordPad or TextEdit. Photoshop switches to whole pixel
increments and removes all anti-aliasing. The type won’t look quite as neat,
but you can prevent the spacing problems. It can also be a good choice for
smaller text.
Faux styles
Photoshop cobbles together imitations of italic or bold typefaces for fonts
that don’t have them. The program normally does an okay job of slanting
the Roman (upright or normal) version of the type, or making the type
thicker to simulate bold. 
At smaller type sizes and for type displayed online, the results are often less
than pleasing. So when creating type for online display, try to avoid using
the Faux styles.
To apply these styles, such as those shown in Figure 1-7, choose Faux Bold
or Faux Italic from the Character palette options menu or click the Faux Bold
or Faux Italic button that appears near the bottom of the Character palette.
Figure 1-7: Just because Faux Bold and Faux Italic styles are available doesn’t mean you
should use them.
Optimizing Images with Save for Web & Devices
One thing to keep in mind as you work with Save for Web & Devices is that
optimization always involves trading off between two goals that conflict
with each other to a certain extent:
 Image quality: With a few exceptions confined to the artistic realm, you
generally want your image to appear on a Web page as sharp as it possi-
bly can be, with the full range of colors shown in the original. The best
quality image should also be sized to fit in well with your Web page design,
no matter what size browser window users are viewing a page through.

Chapter 1
Prepping Web
Graphics

Optimizing Images with Save for Web & Devices
BC18
 Download speed: Short download times are desirable, with no excep-
tions. The ideal Web page image should appear on-screen as quickly as
possible, regardless of the user’s connection speed. Although fast load-
ing times are essential when users have pokey dial-up connections, you
also want fast download speeds for those using faster cable modem/
DSL broadband links.
Unfortunately, you can’t fully meet either of these two goals at all times.
The best quality images and the largest and flashiest photos also take the
longest to download. Conversely, the images that download the fastest can
potentially look the worst.
But don’t panic yet. You can make tradeoffs to ensure that your images
have the quality you expect and the fast download times that users
demand. By choosing the best file format for your image, making some
choices about how much quality you’re willing to give up, and tweaking
your image with Photoshop, you can frequently get the best of both
worlds. Earlier sections in this chapter offer advice on the manual prep
you can do. Save for Web & Devices
provides the automated half of that
equation.
In fact, Save for Web & Devices has
the simplest automation tool of all:
Optimize to File Size, shown in
Figure 1-8. This option is tucked away
in the Save for Web dialog box’s palette
menu (see the next section for more on
this dialog box). Select the file size you
want, click a few other settings, and
Photoshop gives you a file that meets
that file size requirement.
Exploring the Save for Web & Devices dialog box
You can access the Save for Web & Devices dialog box by choosing
File➪Save for Web & Devices from the menu bar. The dialog box, shown
in Figure 1-9 a little later in this chapter, has four tabbed pages, a Tools
palette, a clutch of options and menus, and a generous Preview window that
you can use to evaluate your results.
The following sections briefly describe each of the dialog box’s key 
components.
Figure 1-8: The Optimize to File Size
command creates a file with your target
file size.

Tools palette and image preview
At the left edge of the dialog box is the Tools palette, which includes four
tools and a preview box that closely resemble their counterparts in the main
Photoshop program. Here’s a quick rundown, from top to bottom, of the
Tools palette options:
 Hand (H): Select this tool and then drag in the Preview window to move
the image.
 Slice Select (K): Use this tool to select slices. For more information on
creating slices, see Book IX, Chapter 2.
 Zoom (Z): Use this tool or press the spacebar and Ctrl in Windows (or
press the spacebar and Ô on the Mac) to zoom in. To zoom out, press
the spacebar and Alt in Windows. On the Mac, press the spacebar and
Option.
If you’re using the Hand tool, you don’t have to press the spacebar if
you want to zoom out or in. Hold down Alt or Ctrl (Option or Ô on the
Mac) to zoom out and in, respectively.
 Eyedropper (I): Use the Eyedropper tool to sample colors in the pre-
view image. If you’re sampling in a GIF or PNG image, the Color Table is
available and, if shown, highlights the color you sample in the table.
For more information on GIF, PNG, and JPEG file formats, see Book IX,
Chapter 1.
 Eyedropper Color: This patch shows the color most recently sampled
by the Eyedropper tool. Click the patch to access the Color Picker and
select a color of your choice.
 Toggle Slices Visibility (Q): Click this icon to turn the display of slices
on or off.
The Save for Web & Devices dialog box also lets you control your view of
images. Along the bottom of the window, you see these options:
 Zoom Level: Type a zoom value here, or choose zoom levels from 12.5%
to 1,600%, or select Fit on Screen.
 Status bar: This bar shows the RGB values of the color under the cursor,
the value of any alpha channel, and the hex values and Index.
 Default Browser preview: Click to preview the image in your default
browser. Click the down-pointing arrow to choose another browser.
 Device Central: Click the Device Central button to access Adobe’s new
mini application for preparing graphics for display on cellphones and
PDAs. For more info, see Book I, Chapter 3.

The majority of the Save for Web & Devices dialog box shows you a preview
of the image you’re working with:
 Preview windows: The tabs at the top of the window show the original
image, or one of three other optional views. See the “Introducing
Preview options” section, later in this chapter.
 Preview status: This area shows the size of the original image, as well
as various parameters of optimized images, such as file format, down-
load speed, and number of colors.
Change settings
Along the right side of the window, you can make adjustments to the various
color, file, and size settings for your image. Here’s a rundown of what you see:
 Save/Cancel/Done buttons: Use these buttons to save an optimized
image, cancel the operation, or indicate that you’re done optimizing.
 Preset: You can choose settings, including the type of file. I describe
these settings in detail later in this chapter.
 Color Table: Shown only when you select a GIF or PNG image in the
Preview window, this tab displays the Color Table for the optimized image.
 Image Size: Click this tab to resize your image.
 Animation: This new option enables you to select frames and play the
animation.
Introducing Preview options
You have four Preview options:
 Original: Fills the Preview with the original image, giving you a chance
to review it, zoom to the desired size, or divide the image into slices to
be optimized separately.
 Optimized: Fills the Preview window with the optimized version of the
original image. If you like, you can make all your optimization settings
with only this view available. You can compare your results with the
original by clicking the Original tab.
 2-Up: Divides the Preview window in two and shows the original on the
left and the optimized version on the right (or on the top, original, and
bottom, optimized), with information about each in the status box
below the Previews.
 4-Up: Divides the Preview window into four panes. The original image is
shown in the upper-left corner, and three different optimized versions
are shown in the other three panes (see Figure 1-9). If the image is verti-
cal and thin in orientation, Photoshop stacks them four across.

Optimizing Images with Save for Web & Devices BC21
Figure 1-9: The Save for Web & Devices dialog box offers four previews of various 
optimization settings.
Optimizing your image
Before getting into the nitty-gritty of working with the tools and options in
the preceding sections, I give you a quick overview of using the Save for
Web & Devices dialog box. To optimize an image, you follow these steps:
1. Open the image in Photoshop.
2. Choose File➪Save for Web & Devices.
3. Select the kind of preview you want to use by clicking one of these
four tabs: Original, Optimized, 2-Up, or 4-Up.
Although the upper-left pane displays the original image by default, you
can select this pane and change it into a fourth optimized preview.
4. Click in any of the four panes and, in the Settings area of the dialog
box, choose the kind of optimization you want to apply to that version.
I explain these options in detail throughout the rest of this chapter.
5. After you fine-tune the optimization settings and are satisfied with the
results, select one of the Previews and click Save.
Your image is stored on your hard drive with those optimization settings.
6. Repeat Step 5 to create as many different versions as you like, using a
different optimization method for each.

JPEG options
To optimize an image as a JPEG, choose the file format by doing one of the
following:
 Choose one of the preset JPEG optimization settings from the Preset
pop-up menu:
• JPEG High: High quality (low compression)
• JPEG Medium: Medium quality (medium compression)
• JPEG Low: Low quality (high compression)
If you save your own presets for optimization settings, they appear in
the same list.
 Choose the JPEG file format and Maximum, Very High, High,
Medium, or Low directly from the Optimized file format and
Compression quality pop-up menus, shown in Figure 1-10.

Then select any or all of these options:
 Progressive: This option creates a low-resolution version of the image
that downloads quickly (much like an interlaced GIF) and that is fol-
lowed by progressively detailed overlays until the full image is seen.
Again, not all browsers can benefit from this setting. 
 ICC Profile: Choose this option to embed the ICC color profile of the
image in the JPEG file. Very few browsers can correct the colors they
display based on this information, and because it adds about 3K to your
file size, you’re better off leaving it deselected for now. For more on
color management, see Book II, Chapter 3.

Selectively changing quality levels in an image
You can use the Mask button next to the Quality
box to selectively apply different quality levels
to different areas of your image. This is called
Weighted Optimization. To use this option,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Mask button (refer to Figure 1-10).
2. Select whether you want to use all text
layers, all vector shape layers, or both. You
can also select one of the alpha channels.
For more on vector shapes, see Book IV,
Chapter 2. For more on alpha channels, see
Book VI, Chapter 1.
3. Adjust the minimum and maximum quality
sliders in the Quality bar to the levels
you want.
For example, you can specify a minimum
quality level of 19 percent and a maximum
quality level of 62 percent. Photoshop uses
the grayscale values in the masks and/or
alpha channels you select to apply those
quality levels. Photoshop optimizes the
lightest areas of the mask at the highest
quality level you specify and the darkest
areas of the mask at the lowest quality level
you specify.
See the GIF optimization options later in this
chapter for more ways to weight optimiza-
tion by using masks.
4. Click OK to apply the weighted optimization.
You have some additional options in the Preview
Menu pop-up menu, including a choice of
browser dither schemes, whether you want to
hide slices created automatically (see Book IX,
Chapter 2 for more on slices), whether to
include the color compensation option, and the
display of the estimated time for downloading.

Optimizing Images with Save for Web & Devices
BC24
 Optimized: This option creates a JPEG file that is occasionally a little
smaller at any quality setting (and often doesn’t change the size at all),
but not all browsers can display images with this type of optimization.
If you feel many users with older browsers will view your page, you
might want to forgo this option.
 Quality: You can specify an exact quality/compression level by using a
slider or by typing a value into the text box.
 Blur: Images that are slightly blurred can be squeezed more thoroughly
by using the JPEG compression scheme. If your image still looks good
with a tiny bit of blur applied, you can use a setting of 0.1 to 0.5 to gain
a smaller file size. However, most likely you don’t want to sacrifice
image detail, in which case it is better to go with a higher rate of com-
pression and leave the blur setting at 0.
 Matte: This setting lets you specify a color for filling in pixels that were
completely or partially transparent in the original. Partially transparent
pixels are blended with the color you choose. Select a color from the
pop-up menu, or click in the color swatch to select a color from the
Color Picker.
You can save any customized JPEG settings you make by choosing Save
Settings from the dialog box’s palette menu. Your stored settings then
appear in the Settings menu for reuse.
GIF options
The GIF options, shown in Figure 1-11, are generally different from those
available for JPEG, as befits the very different nature of the GIF image.
File Format
To optimize an image as a GIF, choose the file format by doing one of the 
following:
 Choose one of the preset optimization settings from the Settings pop-
up menu. You find presets for GIF 128, GIF 64, and GIF 32 (both dithered
and undithered), plus GIF Restrictive. The figures represent the number
of colors in the GIF image.
 Choose the GIF file format directly from the File Format menu.
Color Reduction Algorithm
This menu includes three categories of options for creating a palette for the
Color Table:
 Dynamic: The options in this category include:
• Perceptual: Favors colors the human eye is most sensitive to.
• Selective: Weights the colors toward those considered Web safe.

Optimizing Images with Save for Web & Devices BC25
• Adaptive: Builds a Color Table emphasizing the portion of the spectrum
containing the colors that are most commonly found in the image —
for example, greens in scenic photos or flesh tones in portraits.
• Restrictive (Web): Also called Web-safe. Uses a 216 Windows palette
and a 256 Mac palette. Ensures that the browser doesn’t dither 8-bit
color images. Be warned that it can create larger files.
With the dynamic options, a new palette of colors is collected every
time you change or optimize the image.
 Fixed: These options include Mac OS and Windows (the palettes used
by the Mac and Windows operating systems, respectively), Grayscale,
and Black and White. The colors available are fixed, but the actual
colors used vary with the image they are applied to.
 Custom: This option uses a fixed color palette created by the user, but it
is not updated automatically when the image is modified.
You can also apply weighted optimization to color reduction by clicking the
Mask button next to the Color Reduction Algorithm box and selecting the
mask as described in the sidebar, “Selectively changing quality levels in an
image.”

Dithering Algorithm
Choose the dithering scheme used to simulate colors that can’t be repre-
sented by the hues in the Color Table. Your choices are Diffusion (a random
type of dithering), Pattern (a regular, halftone screen-like pattern), Noise (a
random pattern that doesn’t spread across pixels), and No Dither. You can
also choose the amount of dithering to allow in the Dither slider or text box.
You can also apply weighted optimization to dithering by clicking the Mask
button next to the Dither box, and then selecting the mask and amount of
dithering as described in the sidebar, “Selectively changing quality levels in
an image.”
Transparency and Matte
Choose Transparency and Matte options to control how transparent pixels
are handled during optimization. Select a matte color from the menu, or
click the matte color patch and choose a hue from the Color Picker. You want
the matte color to match the background color of the Web page as closely
as possible.
 Select transparency and a matte color. This option keeps transparent
pixels in the original image transparent and blends partially transparent
pixels with a matte color you choose.
 Select transparency and no matte color. Choosing None from the
Matte menu makes transparent pixels and those that are more than
50 percent transparent fully transparent, while rendering pixels that
are 50 percent or less transparent as fully opaque.
 Select no transparency and a matte color. Deselecting transparency
and choosing a matte color fills pixels that are completely transparent
with the matte color you select and blends them.
Consult an HTML manual to find out how to determine the hexadecimal
values of the background colors of the page. You can find a description of
hexadecimal colors earlier in this chapter.
Transparency Dithering
Set the options for Transparency Dithering. This option determines how
Photoshop dithers pixels that are partially transparent:
 No Transparency Dither: Leaves partially transparent pixels in the
image alone.
 Diffusion Transparency Dither: Adds a random pattern to partially
transparent pixels. Like diffusion dither, the pattern is spread across
adjacent pixels. You can specify the degree of dithering with the
Amount box/slider.

Optimizing Images with Save for Web & Devices BC27
 Pattern Transparency Dither: Applies a halftone-like pattern to the
pixels that are partially transparent.
 Noise Transparency Dither: Applies a random, nondiffused pattern to
the semitransparent pixels.
Specify the amount of transparency dithering by moving the slider or enter-
ing a value.
Interlaced
Choose whether you want the image interlaced (to appear gradually in the
browser when it downloads) or not interlaced.
Lossy
Select the amount of lossy file compression allowed in the Lossy slider or
text box. You can use masks to add weight to lossy compression by clicking
the Mask button and applying the mask settings as I describe earlier in the
chapter.
Colors
Choose the number of colors in the image from the Colors list. Select a specific
number of colors from 2 to 256, or choose Auto to let Photoshop choose the
number of colors automatically based on the colors in the Color Table.
Web Snap
Use the Web Snap slider or text box to specify a tolerance level that auto-
matically changes pixels that are within that tolerance level of a Web-safe
color to that Web-safe hue. The higher the value, the more Web-safe colors
the image has.
PNG options
If you elect to create a PNG file, two sets of options are available for the two
types of PNG files: PNG-8 (256 colors) and PNG-24 (16.8 million colors).
There is also a PNG-8 preset that consists of 128 dithered colors.
The PNG-8 options, shown in Figure 1-12, are similar to the GIF options
(described earlier in the chapter), with the following exceptions:
 Lossy compression is not available for PNG-8.
 Weighted optimization can be applied to the color reduction and dither-
ing algorithms, which are otherwise similar to those used with GIF.
The PNG-24 options include only interlacing and the transparency/matte
options described in “GIF options” earlier in this chapter.

becoming more common, some Internet cruisers are
still using dial-up connections with top speeds of 56
Kbps. For these users, nothing is more painful than click-
ing a link and watching a blank page laboriously download
a few pixels at a time. When confronted with a page like this,
users are likely to click their Back buttons and move on.

Slicing Up Images
BC32
Your solutions, as Webmaster, fall into several categories:
 Use images with very small dimensions. Buttons and graphic rules
download quickly. However, they are usually ornamental or functional
rather than centerpieces of your page design.
 Select the best format for your image. Choosing the JPEG or GIF format
when appropriate can make a significant difference in how quickly your
image downloads. You find out about these formats and how to make
this determination in Book IX, Chapter 1.
 Optimize the heck out of the image. One image in a particular format
can be five or ten times as large as the same image in the same format,
depending on how you optimize it. You find out how to optimize your
images in Bonus Chapter 1.
 Slice your image into pieces. Individually optimize each piece for its
intended purpose: appearance, download speed, or a combination of
the two. With a little care, you can take a complicated image and divide
it into slices that look as good or better than the original. Slices also
enable you to easily apply Web features such as rollovers.
Another point to keep in mind is that different visitors use different screen
resolutions. If you’re happily cruising the Internet at 1024 x 768 resolution
or larger, that doesn’t mean you should include really large images on your
pages (even if sliced and optimized). Other users with the same screen reso-
lution you use may have set their browser windows to a smaller size or may
be using displays with a maximum of 800 x 600 pixels or smaller. The ability
to slice images doesn’t mean you can fill your screen with gigantic graphics.
Slices also let you treat different parts of an image in different ways, associ-
ating some with Web links to other images or pages, or optimizing each
slice separately. 
Design your Web pages to fit your audience. If your site is geared toward the
masses, make the pages a maximum of 800 x 600 pixels. If it is aimed at a
specialized high-end audience, then you can go as large as 1024 x 768 pixels,
or even 1280 x 1024 pixels.
Slicing Up Images
You can create slices from many different kinds of images. Figure 2-1 shows
a fanciful fictitious Web page, but with the kinds of images you might want
to slice.

Slicing Up Images BC33
Schaf Photo
Figure 2-1: Slicing a graphic-intensive Web page enables you to individually optimize 
selected areas of your image.
For example, you might be interested in slicing the menu of choices on the
left side of the figure so that you can include links to the individual pages
referenced. The lower image of the four foreign lands offers even more moti-
vation for slicing. Each slice is a candidate for a link that takes visitors to a
page devoted to that particular country.
Types of slices
Photoshop enables you to create several different types of slices:
 User slices: You create these slices by defining areas of the image.
 Layer slices: Photoshop creates these slices from layers of an image.
 Auto slices: Photoshop creates these slices automatically to account for
the rest of the image after you slice a bit out of it.

BC34
You find out more about the differences between these kinds of slices
throughout the rest of this chapter.
Creating slices
To slice up an image into user slices, just follow these steps:
1. Select the Slice tool from the Tools palette.
You can also press K to activate it.
2. Drag with the Slice tool to select the part of the image you want to
slice.
For example, I selected the entire Japan area in the lower edge.
A solid slice selection box appears around the new slice, with handles
at each corner and at the sides, top, and bottom. Photoshop assigns the
slice a number and icon in its upper-left corner.
3. Repeat Step 2 to slice the image into as many individual portions as
you want.
For example, I continued to select the other countries to slice the image
into individual portions.
Photoshop assigns each of your user slices its own slice number and
icon, as shown in Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-2: A solid selection box and number appear when you slice your image.
Slicing options
The steps in the preceding section show the slicing operation in its simplest
form. You do have some additional options, however, as I describe in the fol-
lowing list:
 Use a fixed size or fixed aspect ratio (proportion). From the Style pop-
up menu on the Options bar, choose Fixed and type a width and height
in pixels in the Width and Height boxes. Or choose Fixed Aspect Ratio

Selecting and Modifying Slices BC35
and type the relative proportions you want to use (that is, 1:2, 3:4, and
so forth) in the Width and Height boxes. Photoshop constrains the Slice
tool to the size or proportions you specify.
You might want to use Fixed Size to create equal-sized slices in an
image, especially an image composed of similar-sized elements, and
Fixed Aspect Ratio to create slices that have similar proportions.
If you’ve already created a slice that’s the right size to apply to another
portion of your image, you can duplicate the slice by dragging the slice,
with the Slice Select tool, while pressing the Alt key (Option key on the
Mac). Drag the new slice to the location where you want to apply it.
 Create a square slice. Press the Shift key as you drag a slice’s boundaries
to create a slice in a perfect square when the Slice or Slice Selection tool
is active. You can also press Alt (Option on the Mac) to draw from the
center out.
 Create slices from guides. You can create horizontal and vertical guides
that mark the boundaries of your desired slices. Then click the Slices
from Guides button on the Options bar to automatically slice the image
by using these guides.
 Put each slice in its own layer. You can put each portion of the image
you want to define as a slice in its own layer. Then just select the layer
and choose Layer➪New Layer Based Slice. This is how you create a
rollover state (an action taken on a Web page when the mouse passes
over, clicks, or leaves a defined area). You can create rollovers in pro-
grams like Dreamweaver.
Auto slices are slices Photoshop creates to account for the area that you
haven’t defined as a user slice or layer slice. They’re shown on-screen as
dotted lines to differentiate them from the solid lines that define user slices
and layer slices. Auto slices also have gray slice numbers and icons, as
opposed to the blue numbers and icons used to represent their nonautomatic
siblings. If you want to change an auto slice to a user slice (say, it encom-
passes an area you were going to slice anyway), select the slice with the Slice
Select tool and choose Promote from the Options bar.
Selecting and Modifying Slices
The number assigned to each slice is dynamic,
starting with the slice at the top-left corner of 
the image, and going from left to right and top 
to bottom. As you rearrange slices, Photoshop
updates the numbers. Each slice also receives 
an icon that reflects its type, as shown in 
Figure 2-3.

Showing/hiding slices and slice numbers
You can show or hide slices and their numbers:
 Show or hide slices: Choose View➪Show➪Slices.
 Show or hide slice numbers: Choose Edit➪Preferences➪Guides, Grid,
Slices & Count (or Photoshop➪Preferences➪Guides, Grid, Slices &
Count with Mac OS X) and select or deselect the Show Slice Numbers
option.
When the Slice Select tool is selected, you can also hide auto slices by click-
ing the Hide Auto Slices button on the Options bar.
Changing the color of the lines
To change the color used to represent slices, choose Edit➪Preferences➪
Grid, Guides & Slices (or Photoshop➪Preferences➪Grid, Guides, Slices &
Count with Mac OS X) and select a color from the Line Color pop-up menu
in the Slices area.
Selecting slices
To make any changes to a slice, you must first select it. You can select a
slice by clicking any visible portion of the slice with the Slice Select tool.
Here are a few tips for using this tool:
 Switch from the Slice tool to the Slice Select tool: Press Shift+K when
the Slice tool is active. The Slice Select tool becomes the active tool.
 Alternate between the Slice tool and the Slice Select tool: Press the
Ctrl key (Ô key on the Mac) to temporarily activate the other tool. 
For example, if you’re busy slicing images and want to quickly select a
slice, press Ctrl (or Ô) and click the slice you want to select. When you
release the key, the Slice tool becomes the active tool again.
To remove a slice, select the slice and press the Delete or Backspace key
(Delete on the Mac). To remove all slices from an image and start over,
choose View➪Clear Slices. To protect slices from accidental modifica-
tions, choose View➪Lock Slices.
Resizing and moving slices
You can easily resize a user slice or move it to a new location. If you want to
resize or move a layer slice, first select it and then click the Promote button
on the Options bar to change it into a user slice.

Selecting and Modifying Slices BC37
 Move a user slice: Select the slice and position the cursor inside the
slice’s borders. Then drag to its new position. To help keep slices
aligned evenly, you can press the Shift key to restrict movement hori-
zontally, vertically, or to 45-degree angles.
 Place a slice at specific coordinates in your image: Click the Set
Options for Current Slice button on the Options bar, as shown in Fig-
ure 2-4, or use the Slice Select tool to double-click inside the slice you
want to position. The Slice Options dialog box, as it appears with an
image slice, is shown in Figure 2-5. In the X box, type the number of
pixels you want between the left side of the slice and the left border 
of the image. In the Y box, type the number of pixels you want between
the top edge of the slice and the top border of the image.
Figure 2-4: Most slice options appear only when you select the Slice 
Select tool.
 Resize a user slice in any direc-
tion: Grab one of the corner or
side handles of a selected slice
and drag.
 Use dimensions to resize a user
slice: Use the Slice Select tool to
double-click inside the slice you
want to resize. Then type the
width and height, in pixels, in the
W and H boxes.
To simplify positioning slices,
choose View➪Snap To and select
Guides and/or Slices to tell Photo-
shop you want to snap slices to guides or other slices. Then choose
View➪Snap to turn on the snapping feature.
 Duplicate a slice: Select the slice with the Slice Select tool and then
Alt+drag (Option+drag on the Mac).

Dividing a slice
You can further divide a slice you’ve made by following these steps:
1. Using the Slice Select tool, select the user slice or auto slice you want
to divide.
2. Select the Divide check box on the Options bar.
The Divide Slice dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-6.
Figure 2-6: For large graphics, you may want to further divide your slice.
3. Select the appropriate check box(es) to divide the slice horizontally,
vertically, or both.
4. Enter a number in the slices down, evenly spaced or the slices across,
evenly spaced text boxes to split up your slice into that number of
equal slices. Alternatively, specify a size per slice in the Pixels per
Slice box.
5. Select the Preview option if you want to view the new slices in the
document window.
6. Click OK to divide the slice.
Stacking slices
Slices can overlap, but the top slice in a stack of overlapping slices defines
the area allocated to them. You can usually resize slices so that they closely
fit the areas you want to define, but overlapping allows you to create custom-
shaped slices. You might want to change the stacking order of slices so that
the slice encompasses the exact area you want to define.

Setting Slice Options BC39
To do so, select the slice you want to reorder. Then on the Options bar
(refer to Figure 2-4), click one of the following icons (left to right):
 Bring to Front to move the selected slice to the top of the stack
 Bring Forward to move the selected slice up one layer in the stack
 Send Backward to move the selected slice down one layer in the stack
 Send to Back to move the selected slice to the bottom of the stack
Setting Slice Options
Okay, here’s the part you’ve been waiting for: What do you do with these
slices, anyway? In the Slice Options dialog box, you can control how a Web
browser uses the slices.
You can set or view the options for any
slice by double-clicking the slice with
the Slice Select tool or by clicking the
Set Options for Current Slice button on
the Options bar. Either command opens
the Slice Options dialog box, shown in
Figure 2-7. Here are the parameters you
can set in this dialog box:
 Slice Type: You can choose Image
(the usual choice), No Image, or
Table. Select No Image if you have 
a slice that contains only a solid
background color or text because a
nonimage slice downloads very
quickly. If the slice is part of a larger image and contains no actual image
content, you can speed up the download of that portion considerably.
If you choose No Image, the Slice Options dialog box changes, providing
space for you to enter the HTML tags or text you want to appear in the
slice. Choose Table to get a table cell with the type you specified in it. 
 Name: In this text box, you can enter a custom name for your image
slice (unless you chose No Image as the slice type), usually based on its
content. You can name slices automatically by using the Slice Output
options, which I describe in the next section.

 URL: If you enter a Web address in this text box, clicking anywhere in
the slice links to this address. The slice behaves like a defined portion
of an image map you could create in ImageReady.
 Target: Briefly, the target is the default frame (if your Web page has
frames) that will be accessed in the URL you specified in the URL text
box. Describing how to write HTML tags (the language used by Web
browsers) is beyond the scope of this book, but if you’re interested in
more information, check out HTML 4 For Dummies, 5th Edition, by Ed
Tittel and Chelsea Valentine (published by Wiley). 
 Message Text: In this text box, type a message you want to appear in
the browser’s status bar when the mouse passes over the slice. If you
enter nothing, the URL is displayed.
 Alt Tag: This is important text that’s too often neglected. Alt text
appears in nongraphical browsers (that is, browsers that show only
text and not images) and also pops up as sort of a tool tip when the
mouse passes over the slice. Many people still use nongraphical
browsers, particularly users who are visually impaired and rely on text-
to-speech software to translate Web pages to sound. Alt text allows
these folks to “see” a description of your image and serves as a handy
explanation for users who have graphical browsers. The Alt text also
shows up if users suffer a lengthy wait while images download.
 Dimensions: These text boxes show the width and height of the slice
and its coordinate location in the image. You generally won’t want to
change these settings at this time.
 Slice Background Type: Choose a color for the transparent portion of
an image slice (for example, when you’re using a transparent GIF) or 
the full area of a No Image slice. Your choices include None, Matte,
Black, White, or Other. Click the Background Color swatch to select a
specific hue.
Saving Your Slices
After you define your slices and set all the options, you can save your image
with its slices. Use the Save for Web & Devices feature (discussed in Bonus
Chapter 1) to optimize your slices. Photoshop then lets you 
 Choose the best parameters for each slice. For example, you can save
a slice containing spot illustrations or graphical text as a GIF, or a slice
containing many colors as a JPEG.
 Optimize each slice for appearance and download speed.
Photoshop also saves the HTML code needed to display your slices and link
them to the URLs you specify.

Putting It Together
Creating a Splash Page Mockup
Many designers conceptualize and mock up their Web pages in Photoshop before they
compile the components in an HTML editor such as Dreamweaver. Before you sit down
in front of the computer, have an idea of what you are going to create. I always do some
rough sketches of any page I design. That way, I’m not staring at the monitor waiting for
my page to magically take form.
When you’re ready to work with those ideas on-screen, follow these rough steps to
create a splash page with great images, buttons, and logos:
1. Open all the images you want to use in the page.
For example, you can create a splash page (also called a home page in some cir-
cles) for a pseudo company called adventuretrekker.com. 
For the lowdown on prepping your images for the Web, check out Book IX, Chapter 1.
Rather than give you a million cross-references in this exercise, let me just provide
a blanket caveat that lots of techniques, such as selecting, masking, blending,
applying effects, and using layers, are covered in detail elsewhere in the book.
2. Choose File➪New to create the canvas you will use to composite your Web page.
The New dialog box appears.
3. Specify your dimensions, mode, resolution, and background contents.
For the Web, the mode should always be RGB. You can set your background con-
tents to any color or to be transparent. The resolution is really irrelevant because
the pixel dimensions count for on-screen viewing. However, people often use 72 ppi
(pixels/inch) to make it easy.
The dimensions depend on the demographics of your audience. If you want to
design a page that anyone in the world can view, even those in less-developed
countries who are still cruising on old 486 PCs, you may want to stick with 640 x 480
pixels. The page can be even smaller if you want to take into account the browser
menu bar and controls. Otherwise, 800 x 600 pixels may be the ticket. Or for high-
end users, you can get away with 1024 x 768 pixels or larger. Whichever you choose,
leave space for the browser controls if needed. I’m sticking with 800 x 600, 72 ppi,
and white contents for my splash page. You can also give your file a name in the
Name text box. Finally, I am setting my Color Profile to sRGB, a good standard to use
for Web graphics. For more on color profiles, see Book II, Chapter 3. 
Note that Photoshop also offers Web presets. Choose Web from the preset pop-up
menu. Then choose your desired size from the Size pop-up menu.

BC42
You don’t have to create a new blank canvas to composite your multiple images.
Instead, you can use an image as your canvas and drag your supporting images
onto it. Just be sure that the base image is the correct mode and dimensions.
4. Make your first selection. Then with the Move tool, drag and drop the image onto
your blank canvas, as shown in the figure.
For my page, I’m using the image on which I created a snowstorm in Book VII,
Chapter 2. I made a rectangular selection with the Rectangular Marquee tool and
dragged the image onto my white canvas. I left an open area at the top for my navi-
gation bar.
Be sure to name all your layers (double-click the name in the Layers palette).
Creating a splash page can require a lot of layers, so layer management is essential.

5. Make your second selection and again drag and drop the image onto your splash
page.
For my page, I am using an image of a polar bear sticking his head out of a hole in
the ice.
6. Apply any layer masks you need for your images to blend in with the canvas or the
other images.
Click the Add Layer Mask icon at the bottom of the Layers palette. Use the painting
tools to create your desired mask.
My polar bear doesn’t quite look like he actually is part of the snowy landscape
background, so I applied a layer mask and blended him in accordingly. I then used
the Brush tool, with a feathered tip, set to Airbrush mode with a Flow Rate of 10%, to
paint around the edges of my polar bear, as shown in the figure. 
7. If you have prepared a logo, drag it onto the splash page.
If you’re using a vector art logo, such as one created in Illustrator, just choose File➪
Open. Specify your rasterization settings. If the logo is at least 100% of its intended
size, rasterize it as RGB, 72 ppi, and leave the dimensions at the default setting.
8. Create the type and/or buttons for your navigation bar.
I’m not a big fan of buttons unless they are simple and understated. I prefer to use
type only for my navigation bars, like I have done in the figure. But hey, it’s a free
world; if you like buttons, go for it. 
continued

Saving Your Slices
BC44
Be sure that your type looks legible on-screen. Check out Bonus Chapter 1 for
tips on making your type look its best. I used the Futura font for both my logo and
navigation bar, set at 27 points and 12 points, respectively. I set my anti-aliasing to
Crisp.
You can create buttons quickly and easily in Photoshop. Using the marquee or
shape tools, draw a shape such as a rectangle, an ellipse, or even a custom shape
on a separate layer. Open the Styles palette and, with that layer active, simply click
a preset style. Several preset libraries are dedicated to buttons. You find them at the
bottom of the Style palette options menu.
9. Apply any layer effects or styles to your images or type.
I kept it simple and just applied a drop shadow and inner bevel to my logo type and a
drop shadow to my logo. Be sure to keep Use Global Light selected so that your light
source for effects is consistent among all your elements.
10. Add title text to your page and apply any layer effects or styles desired.
I added my title type in the Impact font by using two sizes. Because my type over-
lapped and was offset, I put it on two different layers. I then applied layer effects —
drop shadow, inner glow, and inner bevel, as illustrated in the upcoming figure. Of
course, you can do this step concurrently with Steps 7 and 8, if you want. Then
again, you can do any of the steps in whatever order you desire. There are no hard
and fast rules, so just let your creative juices take over.

11. If you want to, you can now slice your image into chunks, which you can optimize
separately.
Although not mandatory, sometimes slicing your image can help your viewers per-
ceive that a page is downloading more quickly. A Web page with slices loads as
pieces, so users can get glimpses of the graphics and don’t have to wait for the
entire page to load at once.
Slicing also allows you to take chunks of your page and apply separate optimization
settings to them in the Save for Web & Devices dialog box.

By now, you may be so proud of your Photoshop artistry that you want to
show it off to the world on a Web page. Photoshop has a crafty Web page
construction tool built right in, so even if you don’t know anything about
HTML — except that it’s an acronym you hear a lot — you can create a 
Web-based display page for your images with very little trouble.
All you need to do is show Photoshop the location of the images you want
to include on your Web page, select a style, enter a little information, and sit
back and watch while your favorite image editor does the rest. Of course,
you still need to upload the resulting Web page and images to a hosting
service on the Internet and tell all your friends and colleagues where to 
find it. But that’s not too difficult.
You can also apply image maps and rollovers to slices in Dreamweaver. If applying
your slices to individual layers makes more sense, rather than to the image as a
whole, you can do that as well.

anyone and everyone with a browser to see, check out Creating Web Pages
All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Emily A. Vander Veer
(published by Wiley).
A Web gallery is a Web page that includes small thumbnails — miniature ver-
sions of your main images — and links that enable visitors to view those
images in a larger size. But using thumbnails isn’t your only option. The
gallery can also showcase one image at a time in large form and change the
view at intervals, just like a slide show.
Planning Your Page
Creating a gallery requires using the Web Photo Gallery dialog box, which
isn’t all that tough to use — after you know what your choices are. Here’s a
rundown:
 Styles: Your options include a variety of horizontal and vertical layouts
in several different color schemes with other options. The thumbnail
image gives you an idea of the look of the gallery style. 
Photoshop CS3 offers many style templates for Web galleries. The
Horizontal Neutral style is shown in Figure 2-8.

 Source Images: Choosing your source images is as simple as remember-
ing in what folder you saved the files you want to share online. You also
choose the folder you would like your Web photo gallery files saved
to after they are processed. Or you can select multiple files in the
Bridge and then choose Selected Images from Bridge from the Use 
pop-up menu.
 E-Mail: Enter your e-mail address, and your visitors know how to get
ahold of you. If you use one of the feedback templates, they can click
the E-Mail Feedback button, which automatically launches their e-mail
client and composes a message containing the feedback comments.
Just be aware that putting an e-mail link on a Web page invites spam. So
be sure and have your e-mail client’s spam filter on full bore if you plan
on using the E-Mail Feedback feature.
 Options: Your choices on the pop-up menu run the gamut (and each
pop-up menu selection comes with its own set of options). Here’s a
quick rundown of what you find:
• General: From the Extension drop-down list, choose either .htm
or .html as the file extension for your Web page. 
Servers running Windows-based software may insist that pages have
an .htm extension. Those running under Unix or a similar operating
system may prefer .html. Most of the time, the server software
doesn’t care, and .htm does just fine. And always stick with lower-
case extensions.
Select Use UTF 8 Encoding for URL if you want that type of encoding.
UTF-8 encoding allows for Unicode to be used on platforms designed
around ASCII code, such as Unix and Linux.
Select Add Width and Height Attributes for Images to help the Web
browser layout your page as the data is being downloaded. 
Select Preserve all metadata to maintain metadata info.
• Banner: The banner displays certain information about your page.
Enter a name for your site, the name of the photographer, contact
information, the date, and the font style and type for the banner.
• Large Images: With this option, you’re able to control how the full-
size images appear when displayed. You can have them displayed in
their normal size or resize them to small, medium, large, or custom-
specified pixel widths. For Constrain, choose which dimension of
the image you want to constrain during resizing. You can even spec-
ify JPEG compression/quality, add a border, and show or hide the
filename, description, credits, title, or copyright information. You
can also specify the font and font size.

Cooking Up a Web Gallery BC49
You must enter the information for description, credits, title, copy-
right, and so forth for each image separately by choosing File➪File
Info. In the File Info dialog box that appears, you find boxes to enter
all this information. You can also enter this data in the Metadata por-
tion of the Bridge. Photoshop then saves that information with the
image file and uses it with the Web Photo Gallery tool and some
other specialized functions.
• Thumbnails: This option enables you to control the size of the
thumbnails, the number of rows and columns used to display them,
and the size of any border you want to put around the thumbnails.
You can also assign what informational element you want in the title
of each thumbnail. Choose from the filename, description, credits,
title, and copyright information you’ve entered. Note: You can’t set
rows and columns if you select certain styles such as Centered
Frame, Horizontal, or Simple style.
• Custom Colors: Using this option, you can select colors for the back-
ground, the text that describes the images, and any links displayed
in the background, as well as the color of the banner, the active 
links in the banner, and any links in the banner that your visitor has
clicked.
• Security: This option lets you specify any copyright and security
notices that you want displayed with your images. Specify font
attributes and alignment for any copyright and security text.
Cooking Up a Web Gallery
The advantage of displaying your images in a Web gallery (compared to
simply constructing one humongous page that shows all the images at their
full file size) is that viewers with slower Internet connections don’t have to
wait for all the images to download. Even visitors with fast Internet connec-
tions will appreciate not being inundated with a flood of images.
To create your Web gallery, follow these steps:
1. Collect the images you want to display in a single folder on your hard
drive.
You may want to deposit copies of your images, leaving the originals
untouched.
2. Open the first image in Photoshop and make any changes that you
want.

 Adding notes and annotations
 Examining metadata in Adobe Bridge
 Finding out information about Photoshop and your computer
P
hotoshop offers all sorts of ways to find and add information about
your images: The Info palette keeps data about X and Y coordinates or
color information at the ready, depending on what tools you’re using. At the
bottom of the image window, the status bar shows your file’s size and
dimensions. The keyword feature in Adobe Bridge enables you to add key-
words that help categorize images. 
In this chapter, I cover other ways to find information about files or
Photoshop itself. These methods may not be for everybody, but if you do
need them, they’re handy to have. The notes and annotations feature lets
you add comments for colleagues, or lets others leave comments for you. In
Adobe Bridge, photographers, journalists, and others who need to use
Photoshop files for specific applications will want to know about
the Metadata tab, which enables you to view ITPC data,
Camera Raw data, and more. And if you’re looking for
information about Photoshop or your computer, the
Help menu offers a hodgepodge of information that
you’d never think you need but can help when
you’re trying to troubleshoot patches, updates,
plug-ins, and other system information. 
Applying Annotations and Notes
Everybody’s a critic! That’s especially true when
you’re using Photoshop in a work environment — or in
any scenario that involves anything but 100 percent free-
dom to perform your Photoshop magic as you want.

Applying Annotations and Notes
BC54
Sometimes, you want to collect comments from your colleagues, approvals
from your supervisors, ideas from your friends, or nit-picks from your
clients. Photoshop lets everyone have his or her say by using annotations,
notes, and audio comments. You can use these clever feedback tools with-
out worrying about physically modifying the work that you’ve carefully
done. Imagine sticky notes that you can move around your screen, and
you’ll see what Photoshop’s Annotations feature can do for you.
Text documents are often distributed for approval in a Portable Document
Format (PDF) by using Adobe Acrobat Reader, and comments are added by
using either the full Acrobat application or Acrobat Reader. Photoshop is
compatible with Acrobat, too, so you can save your Photoshop files in the
PDF format. For more detailed information on the PDF format, see Adobe
Acrobat 8 PDF Bible, by Ted Padova (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Text annotations, which Photoshop calls notes, are text comments that
appear as icons within an image document when you choose to make them
visible. 
If you’re reviewing someone else’s notes, you simply double-click the note
to view it or to modify the text it contains. 
You can do lots of things with notes:
 Show or hide all the notes: Choose View➪Show➪Annotations.
 Expand any note from its icon: Double-click the icon.
 Edit a note: Expand the note and revise the text by using standard edit-
ing commands.
 Delete a note: Select the note and press Delete.
 Remove all closed notes: Right-click any note (Ctrl+click on the Mac)
and choose Delete All Annotations from the context menu that pops up.
You can also select a note and click Clear All on the Options bar. 
 Move a note’s icon: Drag the icon. (The note still pops up in its original
location, however.)
 Relocate a note’s window: Open the note and drag its title bar to the
new location. It then pops up in the new location.
Creating a text annotation
To create a text annotation, follow these steps:

Applying Annotations and Notes BC55
1. Select the Notes tool in the Tool palette (or just press N).
2. If necessary, change the name in the Author text box on the 
Options bar.
Just click inside the Author text box and start typing.
By default, when you create a note, the name you entered when you
installed Photoshop appears as the author of the note. However, you
may be working on an image with someone else’s computer, or you may
be on the lam and using an assumed name. 
Be sure that everyone looking at the file uses a unique name so that 
you can sort out the various notes and, perhaps, give all of them their
proper weight (that is, always do what the boss says, but take Seymour
the intern’s comments with a grain of salt).
3. Choose a type size from the Size drop-down list on the Options bar.
Choose font sizes in relative sizes from Smallest to Medium to Largest
so Photoshop can adjust the notes to be readable on monitors set for
different resolutions.
4. Click the Color box on the Options bar and, in the Color Picker, select
a color for the title bar of each note and the color of its icon when
you minimize the note.
Color-coding is a good way to differentiate authors, as well as priorities.
For example, you can use Red, Yellow, and Green to indicate relative
status of a particular suggestion, or select a color to represent a particu-
lar author.
5. Click in the note’s window and type the text you want to enter (as
shown in Figure 3-1).
You can use traditional editing commands, such as the Backspace key,
Ctrl+X, Ctrl+C, and Ctrl+V (Ô+X, Ô+C, and Ô+V on the Mac) to edit the
text.
6. When you finish entering a note, click the note’s Close box on the
right (Windows) or the left (Mac OS) end of the title bar.
Photoshop minimizes the note to an icon. 
Creating an audio note
If you have a microphone connected to your computer, you can add audio
notes to your image files. Audio notes are great for adding annotations that
take a long time to type or that are better explained through audio.
Audio annotations can bloat your file size, so unless using audio annotations
is really more advantageous, stick with text notes.

Working with Metadata
BC58
If you want to send an image file to a friend or colleague who doesn’t have
Photoshop, you can still get input. You can even include notes of your own.
To export your file (and its annotations) for review in Adobe Acrobat, just
save the document and choose Photoshop PDF as the format. Be sure to
check the Annotations option at the bottom of the Save dialog box.
Then when your Acrobat-using friend sends the file back to you, just follow
these steps to access his or her input:
1. Choose File➪Import➪Annotations.
2. Navigate to the PDF or FDF file you want to open.
3. Click the Load button.
Photoshop imports the file with the annotations intact.
Working with Metadata
When working in Adobe Bridge, when you select
an image, you can view its metadata. Metadata is
just a fancy name for information that is embed-
ded in your image file, as shown in Figure 3-4. In
fact, Photoshop allows an image to have so much
attached information, the only thing you won’t
know is your image’s favorite color and hobbies.
The metadata categories include the default cate-
gories of File Properties, IPTC (International Press
Telecommunications Council), and Camera Data
(EXIF or Extended Information File). You can also
choose to display additional categories, such as
GPS (Global Positioning System), Camera Raw
(a digital camera file format), and Edit History.
Choose Preferences from the Metadata panel
pop-up menu. Choose the Metadata category
from the left side of the Preferences window.
In the following sections, you can find a brief
description of some of the more frequently used
categories.
File Properties
The fields in the File Properties category include
common vitals, such as filename, size, format,
color mode, and so on. This data cannot be
edited. 
Figure 3-4: Use Bridge to
attach metadata to image files.

Working with Metadata BC59
Choose View➪As Details to display the file properties data next to the image
thumbnail. This option allows you to collapse the left side of the Bridge
without sacrificing the display of important metadata.
IPTC Core
This data includes info commonly used in the media and press industry.
Fields such as headline, credit, source, and copyright are available for input
via File➪File Info. Or make it easy: Select an image, or several images, and
simply click the field in the Bridge and type your entry. If you select more
than one image, Photoshop asks whether you want the change to apply to
all selected images. If so, click Yes. All fields are later editable as well.
The File Info dialog box is extensible, which means that users can create
custom panels with fields specifically tailored to business needs or personal
interests.
Because Bridge is a feature that is used across all Creative Suite applica-
tions, including illustration and page layout programs, fonts and swatches
are part of the metadata that can be reflected.
Camera Data (EXIF)
EXIF data is information that is attached to an image created from a digital
camera. It includes data such as make and model of camera, exposure, and f-
stop settings. If a digital camera didn’t capture the image, it doesn’t have
any EXIF data, although some scanners attach EXIF data, such as date, time,
pixel dimensions, and resolution. Camera Data is not editable.
GPS
Some files, such as images captured by satellites and a few digital cameras,
may contain GPS, or Global Positioning System, data. This data may contain
information on latitude, longitude, altitude, direction, speed, and so on.
However, this data is not shown in the Metadata panel by default.
Camera Raw
Camera Raw is a file format used to capture images by a lot of different 
digital cameras. The image information is captured directly from the
camera’s sensors and is not adulterated by filters or adjustments made by
the camera. This enables photographers to read the image data and make
their own controlled adjustments. Camera Raw data includes settings such
as white balance, temperature, exposure, color saturation, and so on. Like
GPS data, the Camera Raw data is not shown in the Metadata panel by
default.

Audio
With the explosion of digital music it’s no wonder this new category was
added. Here you can enter data regarding your sound files, such as the
name of the artist, album, and track.
Video
For all you videographers out there, this new category enables you to enter
data about your video files, such as the pixel aspect ratio, tape name, scene,
date, and so on.
Edit History
The Edit History option records all the edits (image enhancements,
retouches, and so on) made on an image in an edit log that you can save as
a text file or as attached metadata. Choose the File Handling panel in the
Preferences dialog box to establish your desired settings for your editing
history. See Book I, Chapter 5 for details.
The Metadata panel offers some options via the Palette pop-up menu:
 Find: Select Find to locate images by various metadata fields. For
details on searching, see the next section.
 Increase/Decrease Font Size: Choose these options to enlarge or
decrease the font size in set increments.
 Show Metadata Placard: Choose this option to display the new mini
panel with your camera (exif) and file data. You will be able to view 
data such as camera exposure, file dimensions, file resolution, and
color mode.
 Preferences: Choose the Metadata category on the left side of the
Preferences window. Choose the fields displayed in each of the meta-
data categories. Keep your palette lean and mean by choosing the Hide
Empty Fields option to hide metadata items that are set to 
display, but do not contain any data.
 Create/Edit Metadata: This command enables you to create (you can
also choose Tools➪Create Metadata Template) and edit your own meta-
data templates. Remember, you can create a customized template that
contains only the pertinent data you want about your media assets.

To access the Photoshop Help system, plus some other useful information,
look no further than the handy-dandy Help menu, as shown in Figure 3-5.
You’ll be happy to know that in CS3, Adobe put some effort into improving
the Help system. Just to mention a few improvements, the Help system now
contains lots of embedded cross-reference links that allow you to fully
explore the scope of a feature or command. It also offers direct links to
other resources such as tips, tutorials, user forums, and online support.
If you’re using the Mac OS, the Help menu also lets you turn Balloon Help on

Because you can view the Help screens (they pop up in a Web browser
window) simply by pressing F1 (or Ô+? on the Mac), you might not visit the
Help menu very often, but if you ever want to find all your help resources in
one location, this place is it. Here are some other help sources:
 The About Photoshop splash screen displays the version number of
your Photoshop program. That way you always know whether you’ve
installed the latest patches and updates to Photoshop CS3.
 The About Plug-In entry displays a list of all the plug-ins you’ve
installed for Photoshop. Selecting an item in the list shows an About
screen of version information for that plug-in.
On a Mac, both the About Photoshop splash screen and About Plug-In
menu are on the Photoshop menu.
 The System Info entry displays information about your computer, its
operating system, and available memory, plus Photoshop-specific data
such as the location you set for your Plug-Ins folder. If you like, you can
click the Copy button to copy this information to the clipboard, and
then paste it in a text document and print it out.
 The Updates, Registration, Activation, and Photoshop Online choices
access Internet resources for Photoshop.
 The How To options are quick shortcuts to popular image-editing tasks.
Select one, and Photoshop takes you to the explanation of that topic in
the Help system.
