In 1956, Kenneth Boulding explained the concept of General Systems Theory as a skeleton 
of science. He describes that it hopes to develop something like a “spectrum” of theories—a 
system of systems which may perform the function of a “gestalt” in theoretical construction. 
Such “gestalts” in special fields have been of great value in directing research towards the 
gaps which they reveal.
There were, at that time, other important conceptual frameworks and theories, such as 
cybernetics. Additional theories and applications developed later, including synergetics, 
cognitive science, complex adaptive systems, and many others. Some focused on principles 
within specific domains of knowledge and others crossed areas of knowledge and practice, 
along the spectrum described by Boulding.
Also in 1956, the Society for General Systems Research (now the International Society 
for the Systems Sciences) was founded. One of the concerns of the founders, even then, was 
the state of the human condition, and what science could do about it. 
The present Translational Systems Sciences book series aims at cultivating a new frontier 
of systems sciences for contributing to the need for practical applications that benefit people.
The concept of translational research originally comes from medical science for enhancing 
human health and well-being. Translational medical research is often labeled as “Bench to 
Bedside.” It places emphasis on translating the findings in basic research (at bench) more 
quickly and efficiently into medical practice (at bedside). At the same time, needs and demands 
from practice drive the development of new and innovative ideas and concepts. In this tightly 
coupled process it is essential to remove barriers to multi-disciplinary collaboration.
The present series attempts to bridge and integrate basic research founded in systems 
concepts, logic, theories and models with systems practices and methodologies, into a process 
of systems research. Since both bench and bedside involve diverse stakeholder groups, 
including researchers, practitioners and users, translational systems science works to create 
common platforms for language to activate the “bench to bedside” cycle.
In order to create a resilient and sustainable society in the twenty-first century, we 
unquestionably need open social innovation through which we create new social values, and 
realize them in society by connecting diverse ideas and developing new solutions. We assume 
three types of social values, namely: (1) values relevant to social infrastructure such as safety, 
security, and amenity; (2) values created by innovation in business, economics, and 
management practices; and, (3) values necessary for community sustainability brought about 
by conflict resolution and consensus building.
The series will first approach these social values from a systems science perspective by 
drawing on a range of disciplines in trans-disciplinary and cross-cultural ways. They may 
include social systems theory, sociology, business administration, management information 
science, organization science, computational mathematical organization theory, economics, 
evolutionary economics, international political science, jurisprudence, policy science, socio-
information studies, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, complex adaptive systems 
theory, philosophy of science, and other related disciplines. In addition, this series will 
promote translational systems science as a means of scientific research that facilitates the 
translation of findings from basic science to practical applications, and vice versa. 
We believe that this book series should advance a new frontier in systems sciences by 
presenting theoretical and conceptual frameworks, as well as theories for design and application, 
for twenty-first-century socioeconomic systems in a translational and trans-disciplinary context.

Preface
The past 3 years has been very inspiring for me and the members of the Université 
du Québec à Montréal’s Applied Community Informatics Lab (ACIL) whose core 
researchers include the following: Marie-Kettlie André, Gilles Lemire, Guy 
Gendron, Hassane Beidou, Abdel Ourahou, Guylaine Lavoie, Jean-François Roussy, 
Michel Brière, Marina Palarchevska, Lionel and Pascal Audant, Geoffroi Garon and 
several students from UQAM’s Communication Faculty. As jointly responsible of 
the research entitled “My Portal Col@b and Community Informatics Design”, we 
have met with tens of people coming from the corporate world, academics, govern-
ment, civil society and community and association sector to partake in workshops 
and discussion groups called “COLAB’s Get Together”. From the beginning of the 
project, the government of Quebec and its ministère des Services gouvernementaux 
wanted to have a better understanding of the emergence of a culture participating in 
Internet communities’ importance. The emergence coincided with the desire of 
Quebec’s scientific community to better master the way information and communi-
cation technologies (ICT) interlock with politics, economy and the society in gen-
eral to generate innovation. In 2012, the Secrétariat du Conseil du Trésor took over 
the initiative program called Appui au passage à la société de l’information (APSI) 
while maintaining the same present partners in the project, thus assuring monitor-
ing. Several major events here and overseas have impacted these works.
In particular, various European Community programs surround the Living Labs 
initiatives and the desire to assure a better governance of the complex articulation 
between technology, innovation and society. It gave place to a never before seen 
excitement in the effort to evaluate the effects of technology promotion on society 
(quoting the vast FuturICT project initiative). In addition, we have seen an entire 
group of high-level researchers structure itself around the recent American National 
Science Foundation policies as part of the “Technology-Mediated Social 
Participation” (TMSP) concept/program (Shneiderman 2011). The current context, 
influenced by the proliferation of collaborative Web and by “user/designer” notions 
and “innovative communities”, leads the Fonds de recherche du Québec on “social 
sciences and technologies” to position itself as a major actor in the transfer of 
knowledge and technologies validation. The growing innovation overlap in priority 

viii
sectors and the technological complexity lead the actors to a better understanding of 
the impact networks and collaborative technologies can have on the broader econ-
omy. Canada and Quebec’s governments rely on developing partnerships between 
universities, companies, government research centres and civil society to contribute 
to technological transfer in order to improve the companies’ innovation capacity in 
our country. The appointment of Mr. Rémi Quirion in 2011 as Quebec’s chief scientist 
officer already seems to be a promising initiative.
Also on June 1, 2011, during a speech at Queens University, the Science and 
Technology Canadian Minister Gary Goodyear declared that the government of 
Canada will invest 29,6 million dollars through the CREATE Program to help young 
scientists and engineers acquire professional skills, leadership and the entrepreneur-
ial abilities they need to transition into the workplace and to ensure the growth of the 
Canadian economy. As part of another initiative, Minister Goodyear and the Industry 
Minister, Christian Paradis, received the second report on the situation published by 
The Science, Technology and Innovation Council (STIC) entitled De l’imagination 
à l’innovation—Le parcours du Canada vers la prospérité. This report focuses on 
Canada’s productivity in terms of innovation and provides references allowing to 
measure innovation on a global scale. The De l’imagination à l’innovation report is 
centred on companies’ innovation and the way participants establish partnerships 
within the innovation system. It also studies product innovation, process innovation 
and organizational innovation as well as investments in ICT.
The current ICT and its relationship towards innovation have such extent that it 
reminds me of the collaborative movement centred on the introduction of computers 
in schools and companies in the 1980s. This movement rallied all sorts of subjects 
and partners helping us understand the ICT social impacts on our societies. They 
went from the timid technological determinism in the 1980s to the social and com-
munity appropriation of the new information and communication technologies 
(NICT) movement for discovery and innovation. The potential gains for society are 
huge, and Quebec’s civil society makes no mistake and demands a digital platform 
for the entire province. The “My Portal Col@b” research project has been devel-
oped according to a new reference model called “community informatics design”. It 
seeks to contribute to a thrilling era since it is part of the international innovation 
movement, which until now was only reserved for the “pure sciences” through net-
works (systems) and scientific collaborative platforms like mathematics, biology 
and physics. Today, it expands to the fields of communication sciences and social 
sciences through new expressions and cybernetic languages: cyber communication 
and social cyber sciences.
The work we have accomplished until now is only a modest contribution and a 
sort of prelude to an international research program that will stretch over several 
years. On the shorter term, our UQAM research group has developed a road map that 
stretches until 2020 and aims to vitalize Quebec’s pure sciences and social science 
communities around complexity, collective intelligence and collaborative intelli-
gence, in a reference framework we call “community informatics design science” 
(CID) for innovation. This book is also a contribution to the implementation of the 
“Quebec digital platform” under construction.
Preface

ix
Supporting transdisciplinary researches is far from being an easy task in any 
creative and active environment. And, defining a reference framework that gathers 
design thinking concepts as well as science, digital arts, complexity and social 
sciences is even harder. In the medium term, this lengthy work widely exceeding 
our own works will involve hundreds of people in tens of “collaboratories”, here 
and all over the world. To emphasize the validation effect technology has on society, 
our project wanted to suggest strong conceptual bridges between practical commu-
nities and innovation, complexity and social science theories. With new research 
policies’ support, we hope our project will be reflected in various government levels 
to obtain its future financing and unfold in the innovation communities. The report 
we are presenting to our sponsors, partners and future knowledge “co-designers” 
represents a unique occasion for Quebec’s economy. We should not miss this oppor-
tunity. Why? Because we are entering a new creativity and reflexivity era around 
imagination worlds and more sustainable socio-economic development.
The Ubiquitous Imagination Paradigm
Ubiquitous imagination is a concept serving as a creativity platform at UQAM’s 
Applied Community Informatics Laboratory. This concept supports the idea that 
knowledge and participatory innovation culture production are omnipresent in our 
advanced societies and they are now producing a paradigmatic shift which trans-
ports us towards an age where creativity, imagination and collaborative design take 
over the economic and cultural scene. These concepts take precedence over analy-
sis, critical thinking, doubt and general cynicism of the last two or three decades. 
This deep innovation movement in our “massively collaborative” societies is what 
we call “design society”. It becomes the first employment and economic value 
creator in the so-called fourth industrial revolution. The imagination supported by 
telepresence tools and intervention methodologies and sociocultural innovation 
replace the information reducer paradigm and its treatment. It is completed with 
knowledge and critical thinking concepts, without, however, allowing to be impris-
oned by it. Questioning and giving criticism are, of course, healthy activities when 
we want a clearer picture of a socio-economic process and we wish to re-establish 
confidence in democracy. Furthermore, cynicism is sometimes used for protecting 
oneself against issues that exceed our comprehension. They are to social change 
what immobilism is to a train with a defective engine. Those positions or attitudes 
have a function of supporting change, just like the train’s innate function to move 
forwards. But in reality, they simply do not have the capacity to ensure that function 
anymore. The CAPACITÉS evaluation model (page 132, Chap. 5) refers to the oper-
ational and digital skills in communication and information technologies that enable 
generic design and social design with ubiquitous media (everyware) for user’s gen-
erated content and needs assesment in the context of “socially responsible commu-
nication design”. These concepts refer to a brand new situation of social interaction 
and communication between humans. All citizens, massively and at a large scale,

have the operational capacity to contribute to the organizations’ design develop-
ment, virtual social systems and various services and applications that help to 
update them in a ubiquitous and decentralized manner. The “ubiquitous media” key 
concept translates the current progression of immersive and collaborative environ-
ments of creative cyberspace and innovation meta-universes that have the potential 
to increase and spread the imagination culture usually reserved for intellectuals, 
software engineers, artists, screenplays and creatives, by shifting it towards a socio-
cultural group of users/designers whose global movement is only beginning. 
Contrary to analytical and rational culture at the age of information, the ubiquitous 
imagination era will establish creativity as a priority foundation for culture and 
economy. Will each one of us become a designer or innovator? Maybe not. But we 
would be mistaken to underestimate this trend.
In a few years, we will witness massive innovation and collective creation 
phenomenon never been seen in history. Young generations will progressively 
become active participants in the ubiquitous imagination era. They become ambas-
sadors of the Canadian and Quebec culture by introducing ideas, customs, tradi-
tions, rituals and beliefs to the “global scientific conversation”. In the past, these 
were reserved to micro-environment experts or mass media members. Ubiquitous 
current users, the ubimedia, can contribute to build, share and convey contents sub-
ject to collaborate in the construction of a brand new humanism in the cyberspace. 
They can contribute to cultural identity development (“indentics”) while validating 
a reciprocal interdependency with other cultures’ wealth. The cultural transforma-
tion and economic development supported by technologies are complex evolutive 
and creative processes (“imaginatics”) we cannot entirely allow to develop accord-
ing to laws of fate, current contingencies or external factors. In the absence of a 
good ethical comprehension of the sustainable development mechanism as well as 
the influence technology has on identity, collaboration between foreign cultures and 
the resolution of natural disasters or insecurity, we condemn ourselves to experience 
even more uncertainty, better yet serious conflicts. The “ubiquitous imagination in 
the design society” aims to combine one of the greatest human beings’ cognitive 
functions: the imagination, with organized complexity theories thanks to ubimedia 
at the service of human development. But the appropriation of ubimedia without the 
will of orientation by users’ conscious design is also a bearer of threats. Here is a 
huge social science and communication science research program that will have to 
increase their insertions in the international movement of sustainable development 
over the next few years.
Therefore, ubiquitous imagination characterizes a design society whose culture 
is the “imaginatics”, such as omnipresent socio-economic innovation, continuous, 
open and in real time, supported by collaborative Web design tools. This culture 
is  made possible by the ubimedia we should better define towards a more  
human-friendly world. The idea reflected is, as any agrarian society has produced 
some types of culture and artistic forms and the industrial society has seen the rise 
of political organizations (democracy, fascism, militarism, communism) with their 
own media (radio, television, records, newspapers, books), the design society

­creates new social forms, more specifically, virtual organizations and virtual social 
systems supported in their development by socio-collaborative ubimedia (artificial 
intelligence, Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, modeling and social simulation 
tools). For better or for worse, these new media forms create new organizations and 
institutions we should count on for our future prosperity. Strictly speaking, they are 
not coming soon, but they are currently multiplying all over the world.
This design society brings about the creation of a “design for all and by all” 
circular economy, which requires new ICT skills. But there is more, an advanced 
digital knowledge society will help an innovation economy emerge, which 
becomes more intangible, more abstract, requiring new civic and professional 
skills for sustainable development. It is more or less a crisis recovery strategy 
when our economies allowed outsourcing and offshoring of the logical and ratio-
nal thinking of the industrial era towards emerging economies. Our economies go 
from industrial and informational jobs to an imagination economy. All publication 
employment are declining, while architecture, software creation, computer con-
sulting, production strategies, cinema and mostly video game sectors are in expo-
nential growth. The ACIL team sees this digital advanced knowledge as a hierarchy 
made of at least three levels:
	1.	 The appropriation of basic tools (e-mails, social media use)
	2.	 Production and organization of audio-scripto-visual contents targeting various 
audiences and markets with a micro-, méso- and macrosocial added value
	3.	 The informatics design and adapted collaborative tool configuration, configured 
and personalized to groups and communities in a relocated manner
This individual and collective skills hierarchy is highlighted in our researches 
and in this study carried out as part of the APSI program. It illustrates the fact that 
digital skills represent the first crucial resource in our economies, a resource start-
ing from basic skills in the value creation to high-level skills necessary to intui-
tive, emotional and sensory intelligence as well as ubiquitous imagination’s 
collective digital skills that become vital to the communication society. The inter-
vention hypothesis is that each upper tier provides an excess of value creation at 
a lower level and the result of globalization and design skills generativity makes 
it more available to a large group of knowledge workers who, in return, create 
even more value. Currently, these skills are developing everywhere in the world in 
all kinds of collaborative communities, in small cultural creative groups as well as 
large engineer groups established in collaborative networks as well as the associa-
tion and the municipal sectors. All these design activities revolve around the 
imagination of new technical solutions, the user’s experience, collaborative expe-
rience and the imagination of sustainable digital social systems supported by a 
more responsible communication design. According to our group, the understand-
ing of global issues our country and our planet face creates the need to intervene in 
a more appropriate way. The re-election of President Obama largely demonstrates 
this concern. This challenge we face goes through reinforced social science integration, 
communication sciences, complexity sciences, computer sciences and community 
information systems.

Tribal Imagination of a New Global Scientific Narrative
What can we learn from one of the oldest cultures in the world about design for all 
and knowledge sharing put at the service of more sustainable social systems?
During my last sabbatical year, I had the privilege of travelling to Australia. The 
scholars there believe the first inhabitants of Australia came 50,000 or 80,000 years 
ago. Some even believe they never actually came but have inhabited the continent with-
out interruption for 130,000 years. Therefore, the indigenous Australians’ culture prob-
ably represents the oldest surviving culture on the planet. When we think about the 
British who arrived on the continent in 1788, the imagination is impacted by the surviv-
ing force of these communities, who despite their weak technical means have put in 
place a great survival and sustainable governance model. This assessment prompts us 
to get inspired by the best practices and lessons the Australian Aboriginals’ experience 
can provide to the current sustainable development discussion.
I was immediately intrigued by the Aboriginal culture’s image of longevity during 
my first stay in Australia in 2006 with my UQAM colleague Albert Lejeune. While 
on a mission to participate in an international conference on health knowledge man-
agement, I met Professor Karl Erik Sveiby and Mrs. Dorothy Leonard Barton, 
respectively, knowledge management and empathic design specialists. Both were 
main speakers for the Australian government and its national health and medical 
research council. Professor Sveiby’s conference, in particular, drew my attention 
since it was announcing the writing of a future book about how the traditional 
Aboriginal tales and their artistic practices were used to relay knowledge from one 
generation to the other, whether it was about the environment, laws, human relation-
ships or even interconnectivity between communities. He stated the important role 
of stories and community tales on four levels:
	1.	 Stories told to children about the natural world and animal behavior
	2.	 Relationships, knowledge sharing and the distribution of roles between peoples 
and within the community
	3.	 Relationships between the community and the larger environment; the importance 
of nomadism to preserve the resources
	4.	 Psychic skills, practice and experience that explained how the hidden art of “tales 
and life lessons” were used in knowledge sharing, thus building the learning 
basis of a sustainable society
I was deeply interested by these words, but the book was not yet available at the 
time, so I forgot the upcoming publication announced by the speaker. It is only 
recently, while I was staying in Australia during the winter of 2012, that I was able 
to get my hands on the famous book in a bookstore in Sydney. Sveiby’s book, pub-
lished in 2006 in collaboration with Tex Skuthorpe (a painter, educator and tales 
specialist), tells how the Nhunggabarra Aboriginal people and their culture were 
able to implement mechanisms that made this civilization one of the strongest 
­cultures and the most sustainable of our era in the full sense of what we call a 
knowledge economy today.
Preface

xiii
The main thesis of the book is based on the fact that while several societies 
outside of Australia have emerged, prospered and died, the Australian Aboriginal 
communities have resisted and proven their sustainability over tens of millennium, 
through very dramatic events like the arrival of the British only 225 years ago. 
According to Sveiby, the Australian Aboriginal communities’ sustainable develop-
ment model is the one of the earliest whose trace we found on Earth.
This model conveyed by dialogue, conversations and intergenerational tales is at 
the origin of the Ubiquitous Imagination Paradigm. The vision of a sustainable soci-
ety shared by these communities, their capacity to imagine a long-term future, their 
innovation capacity and their responsible use of resources and the balance of their 
development convinced us of the creative power of life stories and the citizen dia-
logue in the organizations and future sustainable communities’ collective imagina-
tion. Through the power of language, dialogue and communication, we are able to 
convey phenomena and the most intangible as well as the most practical processes 
that increase our understanding of the future while helping to guide it. This attitude 
is related to the power of tales, to imagine and inspire more responsible New Worlds. 
It is through vision exchange and dialogue that young generations learn hope and 
the desire to imagine our societies “differently”.
During this captivating trip, I had the great pleasure of spending several days 
with my partner, Véronique Larcher, in the beautiful little town of Alice Springs, 
built in the heart of the Australian continent. There, far away from the hustle and 
bustle of Melbourne and Adelaide, the fascinating vastness of the desert and 
the  reading of the book led me to these two questions: Why build all these  
socio-technical systems, virtual communities and these social media platforms? 
How can we guide the ICT research towards sustainable imaginative development?
In order to answer the first one, we need to recognize the essential role of com-
munication, not only at certain human affair levels but for the culture and environ-
ment as a whole. Scientists, experts, governments, companies and the civil society 
must validate the more sustainable New Worlds’ current power of imagination 
thanks to a better control of socio-technical cognitive phenomena on a large scale 
supported by digital platforms.
One of the first commentators on the matter, Fritjof Capra, uses the expression “the 
invisible connections” in his 2002 book (the title of his book) translating this proactive 
attitude by showing the links between phenomena, as disparate as environmentalism 
demonstrations, problematic biodiversity technologies introduction, social move-
ments for green energies, university research in biotechnology and human develop-
ment partnerships. Media and social media should be, first and foremost, 
communication and conversation devices putting into play symbolic languages, cul-
tural dialogs, power relations and global consensus building regarding social respon-
sibility and digital environment design at the service of complex co-design of a 
sustainable society. The often invisible dimension of sense and meaning emerging 
from these synthesis tools shows they are only supports for a “computer publicized 
global conversation”. It illustrates the mobilizing power and real learning capacities of 
these new ubimedia tools we can try to use for all human beings’ survival. Consequently, 
it invites us to better ethically guide the development at all tiers of our society.
Preface

The second question refers to the “how”: where should we start our interventions 
and how? At the beginning of humanity and the basis of our modern societies, 
people made sense of their world through the tales they were sharing. The tale is the 
basis of all sciences as a discourse on reality. The Australian Nhunggabarra people 
is only an example of oral tradition that has developed the practice of the tale, but 
we find several others all through discursive practices within the native people of 
Quebec, Canada or elsewhere. Over time, these tales and life stories have become 
more complex, and some even gave birth to sciences, organizations and institutions 
that are very complex in their organization and knowledge legitimization, such as 
universities. They taught us that man is not outside of nature, but part of it and the 
universe. The separation of the observer and the science object is based on restrictive 
and reductive imaginative concepts applied to living system complexity such as the 
first phase of science was practicing it (Bausch and Flanagan 2013). In the second 
phase, we learned to ask better questions and to build better objects. If the first 
phase of science was locating the object outside of man, the second one tried to 
negotiate in a more flexible manner with subjectivity and cognition of the researcher 
in the observation of phenomena. While trying to reduce reality to an external 
object, the second phase tried to locate its observation in a wider context, less 
restrictive. However, it had to go further. Our society promotes the co-building of a 
third phase of science, a “citizen science”, emerging from the integration of multi-
ple points of view, transdisciplinary research partnerships and intersectorial com-
mitment in new knowledge production process.
In this book, we introduce you to a new scientific field based on the third phase 
of science, inspired by the discovery of the tale as a world apprehension mode, as a 
learning method and collective design where various dialogue worlds suggest a 
vision that re-establishes the role of humans in the world, nature and technology: 
the community informatics design science. We consider this applied science as a 
means of understanding and adapting complex social situations of our time while 
freeing ourselves from reductive scientific silos of the two first phases of science. 
We will come back to it in various chapters of the book. Rising collaborative com-
munities of the social Web are the actor of this third phase of science, where the 
object is observed according to a confrontation/tension/balance dialectical between 
realistic, subjective and individual points of view on one hand, collective and inter-
actionist on the other. We observe in these new plural and communication contexts 
the explosion of various language modes and “scientific tales”, where the reciprocal 
interdependence of millions of users/designers allows to share transdisciplinary, 
transcultural and paraprofessional perspectives around global interest issues. 
However, we would be wrong to believe this new science that includes observers’ 
communities would only be founded in tales, common sense, legends and myths, 
even a lack of rigor, where the absence of formalism or systematization would be 
the norm. Quite the contrary. The global scientific discussion, thanks to the Internet’s 
socio-technologies, calls out all social groups. This is why we approach new 
collaboration situations allowed by technology to better build our research objects, 
to document issues by multiple angles of observation and to deepen our examina-
tion of mechanisms often difficult to understand because of large-scale social

change, as well as the acceleration of innovation through a new reflection of  
socio-scientific dialogue and global action representing the priority role of the 
community informatics design field: accompany cultural and citizen validation of 
intentional social change according to sustainable development values.
However, despite its activities’ systemization effort, the ubiquitous imagination 
supported by informatics design is not conceived as a new triumph of reason over 
myths and tales of the planet’s first communities. It rather suggests to get inspired 
by it metaphorically as a new mode of scientific evolution, supported by a humbler 
vision of the world, while inviting us to capture this precious moment in recent his-
tory where we all experience for the first time the potential of ubiquitous imagina-
tion in the design of solutions better suited to global issues. The Western philosophical 
and scientific tradition seems to rediscover this force inspired by the First Nations 
indigenous people, the sitting of a tribe around the fire, forming an effervescent 
circle where imagination catalyses itself by the tale, the fire of creative spirits inspir-
ing multiple solutions from various dialogues. It is strange that our societies have 
only recently discovered this form of powerful ancestral wisdom, animated by our 
desire to observe the world, to better understand it in order to solve large-scale 
socio-technical problems together and to better confine large dimensions related to 
the challenges that distinguish our time. In this preserved tradition of tribal social 
system practices, could we find a new social and scientific communication situation 
and a new paradigm for the study of complex digital social system development? 
Away from social media excesses rightly highlighted and condemned by the local 
and international press, would this new collaborative culture make us think about a 
new humanist and global scientific discussion based on the collective and ubiquitous 
imaginations of our future?

Montréal and in particular my colleagues at the Communication Faculty, my aca-
demic home for nearly three decades, for giving me the required university freedom 
for intellectual exploration and transdisciplinary imagination. Thank you to my col-
leagues at the Hexagram Institute, an international network dedicated to research 
creation in arts and technology, for encouraging the birth of a social science and 
communication design thinking perspective.
I am deeply grateful to Marie-Kettlie André for the numerous meticulous proof-
readings of the book and chapters’ revision, not to mention the long hours of dis-
cussing concepts and the work’s general organization over the years. I thank her as 
well as Hassane Beidou for their collaboration on two chapters. The creation of a 
reference book in any new scientific field requires efforts related to several types of 
collaboration. And so, my gratitude extends to UQAM’s Applied Community 
Informatics Lab (ACIL) team of students and collaborators, in particular my col-
league Gilles Lemire, my research partner for over 15 years now, and Guy Gendron, 
a communication PhD student, a great techno-pedagogic teacher and one of the best 
social counsellors in Quebec, especially with Atikamekw communities from 
Wémotaci, for his unfailing support regarding my work since 2005. Thanks to 
Geoffroi Garon Epaule, one of our Ph.D student in the Doctoral Communication 
Program at UQAM, anthropologist and Community Informatics Design specialist, 
for helping me in the creation and revision of many of the book’s figures and for his 
ongoing support for many years in our classes and conferences; and also, to Michel 
Brière and his CCA team, in particular his colleagues Guylaine Lavoie (project 
manager) and Jean-François Roussy (multimedia creator). Thanks also to 
Abderrahman Ourahou, for his computer expertise, and Marina, for her work in 
visualization and her evaluation chart of the information visualization tools. Thank 
you to all the collaborators from UQAM’s Service de l’audio visuel (SAV), in par-
ticular Louis Guérette, Nathalie Lavoie and Anne-Marie Sauriol for creating our 
websites related to this book. Thanks to Samuelle Ducrocq-Henri, for her doctoral 
work regarding the application of video games scenarios to serious learning, and to 

xviii
Pierre Bérubé, who opened several perspectives on communication approaches 
applied in a crisis and chaos context. Thank you to my partners Lionel and Pascal 
Audant, Yves Lusignan, Gilles Guay, Éric Grimard and Alexandre Gravel and to 
Monique Chartrand and her organization’s team at Communautique.
My acknowledgements also to all my colleagues who participated in our research 
works in different ways through various forms of dialogue: more specifically  
Louis-Claude Paquin, Carmen Rico de Sotelo, Mireille Tremblay, and her doctoral 
student Nadine Martin, Isabelle Mahy, Jean-Marie Lafortune, Gaby Hsab, Christian 
Agbobli and Michèle Isis Brouillet. Thanks to Martin Lussier, for his reflections and 
collaboration on cultural intervention strategies; to Albert Lejeune from UQAM’s 
Management et technologie Department, for recommending us books on organiza-
tional modeling and enterprise architectures; to Marc Trestini, for welcoming us in 
Strasbourg, and Professor Jean-Paul Pinte from Lille, for participating in our semi-
nar on socio-technical design in Sherbrooke in 2011; to Pierre-Michel Riccio and 
Jean-Michel Penalva for welcoming us at the Mines d’Alès School in 2006 and 
for  allowing us to publish one of the first articles on community informatics 
design  in France; and to Dotty Ager Gupta, Kjell Erik Rudestam and Judith 
Schoenholtz-Read from the Fielding Institute in California for allowing a larger 
­diffusion of our work on community informatics design published in English by 
Sage and allowing to develop basic concepts of this book.
My acknowledgements also to Robert Proulx, rector of UQAM, Magda Fusaro 
and Marcel Simoneau who, with several colleagues from UQAM’s Comité 
Institutionnel sur les Environnements Numériques d’apprentissage (CIENA), con-
tributed to the book’s several reflection elements especially regarding the application 
of socio-technical higher education platforms like Moodle. My gratitude to Professor 
Jurgen E. Mueller from the University of Bayreuth in Germany with whom we have 
developed a master’s class and a partnership on community informatics design 
research in their Media Management Department. Thank you to the successive deans 
from the Communication Faculty, Marquita Riel, Enrico Carontini and Pierre 
Mongeau, for supporting our work and for granting us an important physical space 
for our research. My gratitude to colleagues like Serge Proulx and Florence Millerand 
who placed their trust in me by allowing me to evaluate several master’s and doctoral 
papers in information technology and communication. In the same spirit, thanks to 
my doctoral colleagues from Informatique Cognitive and Téléuniversité, who allowed 
me to sit on several evaluation committees, and also to Anne-Marie Field for trusting 
us and for accompanying us in our future informatics design research.
Several curious and critical generations of graduate students have raised interest-
ing questions and drawn my attention to relevant publications. A large number of 
social media readers spread over the Internet have asked questions, provided infor-
mation and offered criticism. Finally, a good number of universities and scholarly 
organizations in half a dozen countries gave me the opportunity to speak and share 
my thoughts, our hopes and our fears with prestigious researchers and bright stu-
dents from various fields. More recently, we would like to thank the colleagues at 
the MIT Media Lab and their European colleagues from the FuturICT project, espe-
cially Dirk Helbing in Zurich and Markus Eisenhauer in Bonn, for welcoming us

orative platform in digital humanities and social computational science.
Last but not least, I would like to especially thank my colleague Ms. Danielle 
Maisonneuve to have welcome us in her collection called “Communication” at the 
Presses de l’Université du Québec, for the first edition of the book in French in 
2014. Thank you to all the PUQS team, Ms. Céline Mercier, Director General; Ms. 
Nadine Elsliger, Publishing Director; and their computer graphics and editing team. 
I would also like to thank my new international editor, Springer Nature, especially 
Christopher Coughlin, Senior Editor, Fan Ho Ying, Assistant Editor, Jeffrey Taub 
Project Coordinator/Book Production, and Aishwarya, Chandramouleeswaran, 
Project Manager SPi Content Solutions – SPi Global. Thank you for trusting us in 
editing a transdisciplinary reference book in the new “Translational Science” col-
lection. We really hope and wish that this book, will help our future generations of 
students and young researchers in designing a sustainable world. Last but not least, 
all my gratitude goes to Virginie Bucco for the translation of this book during the 
last year. I have appreciated her discipline and great professionalism.

Global Transformation and Design  
Principles in the Knowledge Society
We live in a communication and information society that has become a global and 
evolutive force in our everyday lives.
But the promises of significant benefits of this transformation, for too long quali-
fied as a revolution by technology experts, will not get created without a global 
planning and a generic design of information and communication systems effort. 
These have become an integral and emergent part of the participative users’/design-
ers’ culture. In sociocultural terms, information and communication systems must 
be put at the service of people and communities. They must be reliable, user-­friendly, 
intuitively significant and available everywhere at all time. In this important phase 
of the information age, the “design for all” becomes essential.
In this context, this book represents a development effort of foundations and the 
reference framework of a collaborative design form that is more and more practiced 
by various users’ communities in Quebec: community informatics design. It relies 
on the report of a research conducted by the UQAM’s Applied Community 
Informatics Lab and offers some answers to the Secrétariat du Conseil du Trésor du 
Québec program called Appui au passage à la société de l’information (APSI), 
regarding ubimedia appropriation levels and collaborative tools by various commu-
nities spread all over our vast territory. Between 2010 and 2012, our lab’s team of 
professors and students asked the following questions while formulating three gen-
eral hypotheses. The “community informatics design and My Cola@b portal” proj-
ect’s main objective was to lead case studies, write questionnaires to evaluate design 
practices and discover interactional and organizational trends for the following 
purpose:
	1.	 Explore infrastructures, platforms or portals, which have existed for several 
years, within various organizations to identify the structure and process.
	2.	 Help with the design and production of a multiplatform portal model adjust-
able to the needs of various organizations from the projects’ several life cycles’ 
analysis. We have combined knowledge from numerous projects and multiple 

2
studies to present a high-level reference framework that inspires other 
researches and practices in the field of modeling virtual networking organizations 
(hypothesis 1).
	3.	 Experiment an “organizational information systems design” (or community 
informatics design) aiming to lead virtual communities while encouraging trans-
disciplinary studies involving computer specialists, communication experts, 
sociologists and artists.
We have developed a reference framework, an instantiation strategy and a funda-
mental verification list necessary to the technological, communication and organi-
zational modeling functionalities, to ensure that future organizations and digital 
social systems would be off to a good start (hypothesis 2).
Virtual organizations are co-built as social and technological systems (a socio-­
technical system.) They simultaneously include:
	1.	 Human factors (people or subjects)
	2.	 Worlds of knowledge to share (contents)
	3.	 Socio-collaborative platforms adjustable to each organization’s needs (tools or 
cloud and ubiquitous computing instruments.)
On an epistemological scale, the APSI research will contribute to define the 
“community informatics design” scientific bases which is organization and virtual 
communities’ design as socio-technical environments supported by ubiquitous 
media: the ubimedia (Greenfield 2007.) These environments are received as new 
socio-economic ecosystems (hypothesis 3). The community informatics design and 
My Col@b Portal research project lead several case studies, here and internation-
ally, in order to transform experiences with Internet and information and communi-
cation technologies (ICT) in a typical case. These activities were executed by 
organizations (ACIL, CCP, CA, among others) and more particularly by enterprises 
and people. These research approaches should shed an epistemological light upon 
imposed transformations by recent Internet evolution. They touch its instrumenta-
tion, its forms of communication and community informatics organization, as well 
as the planning of social networks made of people, organizations or communities of 
all kinds. It represents many systems that become more complex and specialized in 
the multiple relations to tools and contents in the digital world.
In the past decades, social computer science’s main objective was to make peo-
ple work in virtual spaces and allow them to achieve a better productivity with tools 
that were encouraging information digital uses, such as texts, images, sounds and 
videos. The recent social, ubiquitous and user-friendly computer science emer-
gence, like new Web 2.0 media (LinkedIn, MySpace, YouTube, Flickr, Facebook), 
collaborative platforms (Ning, Google Group, Vox, Apprendre 2.0) and collective 
design platforms (CIEL Project, Laboranova, Service design from Roberta Tassi, 
Habitats from Wenger and Smith), allows the world of citizen Internet to enter in a 
new creative phase of socio-technical systems development (Whitworth and De 
Moor 2009; De Moor 2005; Barab and Kling 2004; Barab et al. 2004). And the 
module or platform configurations in diversified environments, often mobile, are

required: My Col@b Portal research project will contribute to the design, script 
writing and the production of customized portals by prototyping a virtual social 
systems community informatics’ assistance portal. This implies that users – organi-
zations and people – to various degrees and different tiers of society, by positioned 
uses and by current ubiquitous social media, will develop new needs for autonomy 
and participation in the information and communication society.
In order to do so, our ACIL team had to develop a new support methodology for 
the development of communities’ users that became necessary through the desire to 
make the general process and the life cycle more systematic. My Col@b Portal 
research project aims to erase doubts related to the evolution of the Web’s uses, 
considering the information flow, relations to the worlds of knowledge and more 
participative usage of tools put forwards by socio-technical systems operations and 
generalized ubimedia appropriation. The verification and evaluation of past and cur-
rent uses (case studies) as well as the observation of new uses (questionnaires) 
related to My Col@b Portal script writing and production (discovery matrix), per-
sonalized and operated by this research-associated partners, brought us elements 
disconfirming or confirming our hypothesis and building our models.
1.1  The Sociohistorical Context
Large-scale environmental concerns, natural and meteorological disasters, the cur-
rent financial crisis, the wars all over the world, the social divide intensifying within 
democracies, the accelerated growth in Asian countries’ population, the continuous 
reforms in national health and education systems and the epidemic progression of 
cybercrimes and cyberattacks prove that humanity is facing unprecedented chal-
lenges. These changes touch everyone’s everyday life, each family, each community 
and each country and define the human being’s future.
However, we are entering the second decade of the third millennium with orga-
nizations designed for the most part in the nineteenth century. The improvement or 
restructuring of existing systems founded in the industrial age of the machine does 
not work anymore. The population realizes that the massive society changes and 
current global transformations are reflected in the new realities of post-industrial 
age, of the knowledge and information economy society. Only an ubiquitous imagi-
nation and a massive innovation effort will allow us to face requirements of our era’s 
new realities and aspirations and contain the generalized risks of youth’s disillu-
sionment and massive cynicism.
Some questions arise: What role each citizen plays in those massive changes? Is 
he without a voice or means? How can he switch from one social innovation vision 
centred on closed local innovations’ structure to a new vision oriented towards the 
new interaction ICT systems that would allow us to understand complex social sys-
tems we created in cyberspace and the emerging collective phenomena typical to 
their evolution? How can we switch from a geocentric vision of the world to a helio-
centric one allowing us to grasp the world of economics and the society transforma-

tions? How can we grasp the socio-dynamic of the digital culture and the transitions 
between various change paradigms? How can we orientate our future by developing 
a science, technology and society approach that aims to ensure the distributed gov-
ernance of these complex worlds and analyse new human organizations in global 
interconnectivity?
With the present book, we would like to answer these questions. The “My Col@b 
Portal community informatics design” project, in development, will combine the 
power of creative and information technology and communication tools with the 
knowledge of the complexity sciences, social systems and social science theory as 
well as computer science. We will show that a research attitude too exclusively 
founded on the critics of the “community informatics design” existing systems, a 
research orientation combining critical analysis strengths and the conception/ 
simulation of multiple aspects of evolutive phenomena, will make social sciences 
leap forwards towards the new era of complex information systems’ design. 
Complexity and emerging digital social systems sciences will shed new light on 
phenomena like virtual communities and innovation communities, as well as a mul-
titude of networked organizations, virtual enterprises and interactive social struc-
tures where the knowledge that will influence our future is produced at a speed 
never seen before in history.
In that context, we will explore the emerging needs of online social systems, digi-
tal skills necessary to their development, possible means to create collective and 
collaborative intelligence to contribute to the advent of a better future for our chil-
dren and for ourselves and our emerging new social needs for digital social systems 
and for our growing innovation communities. The present research’s basic idea is 
that community informatics design – as large-scale communication and collaborative 
digital social systems methodology, like virtual communities building that we can 
perceive as socio-technical systems design  – is a human creation activity of the 
future. These digital social systems and virtual communities and individual and 
group partners commit to the design in a way of distributing tasks and roles in the 
implementation of corresponding innovation systems that catalyse desirable changes. 
Or even they can improve and restructure existing systems according to what they 
believe to be a more favourable system that matches their collective values. 
Complexity sciences will shed substantial light on emerging phenomena like interac-
tive social media. Social sciences and more particularly social and public communi-
cation sciences will improve our understanding of perspectives and risks related to 
strongly interconnected social systems, especially the Internet community informa-
tion systems. We will see that those analyses will create new theoretical approaches, 
new methods and new tools allowing to apprehend the twenty-first-­century transfor-
mations. Furthermore, they will create communication society’s new employment.
Thus, building on the needs of the skill and practice study we have achieved on 
the Quebec territory, we analyse what we call the community informatics design 
“8C”. They represent the main concepts of our APSI research: cognition, communi-
cation, conversation, cooperation, collaboration, coordination, skills (competences) 
and contracts. In an era where speed, intensity and complexity of change increase 
constantly and exponentially, the ability of human communities to mould this

change instead of being the spectators or victims depends more and more on digital 
analysis, synthesis, production and network knowledge sharing skills. A generic 
design skill, multi-skills and a great motivation to guide our digital social systems 
intentional evolution will become one of the Western nations’ education priorities in 
a few years, to all tiers of society organization.
The digital social systems co-design program and similar endeavours could 
become in the short term certain of the most important scientific programs of our 
time just like artificial intelligence and operational research were for pure sciences 
in their time. Why? Simply because this program will reveal the structures, pro-
cesses, values, skills and ethical principles that will allow interactive and networked 
social systems to be oriented by the citizens. By inspiring the appropriation and the 
social creation of new innovation tools that enable the exploration of “invisible con-
nections” (Capra 1997, 2004), we will be able to collectively anticipate and influ-
ence our future. And by establishing an age of “socially responsible communication 
design” through many kinds of innovation portals we will mobilize the collective 
intelligence of many actors to create new collaborative networking organizations 
and institutions. The program will build the knowledge base necessary to its sup-
port: the philosophy, the theories, the methodologies and the applications and the 
online social systems design instrumentation.
Thus, we note five major interdependent transformations:
•	 The Explosion of Digital Communication: This phenomenon becomes the new 
central field of information and communication theories; its validation effects on 
society and organizations are still little known. It promotes human activities by 
inviting us to configure ourselves and our artefacts with new small digital tools 
that form the basis of the community informatics design in a ubiquitous imagina-
tion society.
•	 Mobile and Ubimedia Network Generalization: We are headed towards what 
Marc Weiser, researcher at the famous Xerox PARC laboratory, predicted over 
20 years ago – computer science without computers, where knowledge sharing 
extends to the opposites through minuscule devices interconnected with every-
day life elements. The word “ubiquitous” does not only mean “everywhere” but 
also “in everything”. A more and more invisible computing but omnipresent is 
emerging and gives us the tools of autonomy in the creation. It comes with the 
birth of a movement of designers and developers who produce their own func-
tional modules likely adaptable to other devices or existing platforms.
•	 The Appropriation and the Acquisition of Design Skills by Network Practices: 
This appropriation becomes a priority in regard to simple access to technology. 
Even if the access to technologies and new media issue has been a social priority 
for 20 years, it is shifting towards design activities making them possible. We 
have to promote a new digital literacy to all tiers of the education system. Just 
like people love to tend their own garden themselves despite the existence of 
large produce markets, they like to configure their own creativity and design 
tools from existing platforms. Programming becomes the users’/designers’ new 
first role, which encourages their organization autonomy in facing greater threats 
of state surveillance, cybercriminals and spies, social control and the everyday 
life gadgets from superficial applications. These new society self-organization

possibilities by design redefine citizenship, democratic institution participation, 
innovation ecosystems and work methods.
•	 The “Design for All” Generalizations: Design is more and more distributed; 
therefore, in Quebec, in Canada and across the world, it becomes a common 
practice that is trivial to society as a whole, more a way of life than a separate 
profession reserved to the creative elite. In fact, this affirmation goes much fur-
ther: design cannot be left to designers alone. Here is a new face of the citizen’s 
principal liberties. The designer becomes a virtual ethic and democratic environ-
ment programmer, and “to program or being programmed” (Ray Kurzweil), in a 
society of communication opulence (Moles 1967, 1990; Moles and Jacobus 
1988; Moles and Rohmer 1986, 1998), becomes the new modus operandi of the 
enlightened citizen and competitive economies.
•	 The End of Technology-Centred Design: While being aware of its glory, this 
form of design is, in a certain way, near its decline. Indeed, the community infor-
mation systems co-construction needs a wider reference framework that con-
cedes a part of the national innovation technological platform to human, social, 
cultural and economic dimensions. We currently all participate, through net-
working design practices and activities, in a wide communication turn (“dia-
logual”, semantics and semiotics) in design, which, as a priority, becomes centred 
not only on the individual user but simply on the human. Moreover, alongside 
this major colossal challenge, we witness the international emergence of new 
partners for innovation that demand new scientific, methodological and applica-
tive approaches. This open science, more collaborative and largely supported by 
“conversational” ICT, tries to unify aspects of computer sciences and complexity 
sciences. Above all, it invites social and communication sciences to make a qual-
itative leap towards a better online theorization/modeling of digital social sys-
tems, made to serve great issues related to the needs for innovation of our time. 
It calls for a motivating vision of the future and new development principles as 
well as training programs to face the challenge.
1.2  The New Design Principles Emerging from Our Works
One of the largest orientations that guided our research, for nearly 5 years now, was 
to explore the principles that will rule the design of virtual environments dedicated 
to innovation in the future. We have, however, explored other avenues in order to 
give our works another scale that will have positive impact on collaborative design 
over the next 30 years. Our group appointed itself to evaluate the elaboration means 
of necessary governance mechanisms to support Quebec’s national efforts towards 
a global digital platform construction to serve the economy. Our report is supported 
by discussion groups, case studies and an evaluation questionnaire on design prac-
tices of various Quebec innovation communities and enterprises. It recognizes a 
radical change in practices that go from an industrial mode of production of knowl-
edge reserved for experts to a ubiquitous imagination and collaborative intelligence

context. Their tools and applications are not, strictly speaking, support tools nor 
mirror sites of existing organizations. New practices go much further. Our research 
results indicate that we are co-building, with the help of virtual environment tools, 
brand new intelligent organizations from social and informational architectures that 
question the basic knowledge we should pass on to the youth and to all citizens in a 
design for all society. The design society users/designers need to better understand 
the complex process of social and public communication and to think about the 
principles and values associated with the development of community information 
systems, ubimedia and devices likely to improve our quality of life. The ten design 
principles emerging from our works first apply to:
•	 To future users/designers of the civil society, who need more training suitable to 
the knowledge society.
•	 To the practitioner designers who have the intention of partnering with important 
works on digital social systems and the development of communication and col-
laborative artefacts, co-design will become a priority in the next decade.
•	 To educators and trainers issued from social and communication sciences who 
want to better prepare students facing new professional practices that require 
new higher-level digital skills.
•	 To enterprises looking for qualified workers in generic tools, applications and 
services as well as governance and performance indicators of superior quality.
•	 Finally, to financing institutions and to government foundations supporting sci-
entific research, the education system and its training initiative as well as the 
support platforms’ development towards an information society. They should 
include these principles in their actions and encourage their adoption in order to 
contribute, even modestly, to improve insertion of all in this constant socio-­
technical revolution.
Here are the ten principles, which are research-intervention hypothesis, we sup-
port throughout this book:
First Principle  We recommend that the construction of artefacts and collaborative 
platforms supported by ubimedia makes more sense for the users. This sense resides 
in the way the stakeholders are partnered with a project and invest their values and 
skills to improve living conditions. In terms of operational practices, the sense and 
understanding require the designer to be more attentive to the social and communi-
cation foundations of their practices and to intervention parameters related to ide-
ologies, beliefs, ontology, epistemology, theories, methodologies and applications.
Second Principle  We recommend that the design focuses on the development of 
collaboration interfaces and actions between humans and technologies. The current 
ubimedia tools became unthinkable, considering the acceleration of their produc-
tion and obsolescence. Without a design oriented towards interfaces that translate 
more the various human worlds, we run the risk of getting trapped by a causal, lin-
ear computing, instrumentalizing human activities’ universes in an algorithmic way. 
This aspect of “ethical” computing, with its human and social factors, has been 
considered as a “secondary employment” of specialists. The progression of the 
1.2  The New Design Principles Emerging from Our Works

8
social Internet now makes it a priority; no modern society can keep its population 
away from technological orientation and its various manifestations. A new commu-
nication and networking empirical domain arises that we call community informat-
ics design.
Third Principle  We recommend that the diverse types of socio-technical design 
extend their object and traditional preoccupations for the auditive, the visual and the 
textual to all senses, to the entire body, in different spaces (physical, virtual) like any 
important elements evacuated by numerous contemporary communication 
approaches. Furthermore, in addition to an object-oriented approach in the design of 
information systems, we recommend and greatly document a brand new approach 
oriented towards aspects (dimensions) that suggest a much more holistic intentional 
social change, oriented towards change. Taking into account the multi-sensoriality 
and the multiple aspects related to information systems design could suggest the 
development of systems, products or improved applications such as digital social 
systems. The persons and communities with specific needs and workers who need a 
work ergonomics better adapted to their cultural and psychosocial characteristics 
could see their work interfaces improve.
Fourth Principle  One essential achievement of innovation communities associ-
ated with the co-creation through open-source code interfaces was to ensure the 
variability adaptation to users’ needs. We recommend the ubimedia artefacts and the 
collaborative tools to be designed in a variable way, adjustable and customizable. 
These tools will be “multi-aspectual” to support users without trespassing their 
skills, while respecting the capacities of the various stakeholders, their needs, their 
communication requirements, their world vision and their conception about the 
worlds to be built. Interfaces must be open and flexible; they must encourage fluid-
ity and speed of knowledge appropriation while avoiding the information overload. 
We must be able to differentiate the products and the services, to reconfigure and 
personalize the interfaces, to instrument the more destitute ones, to implement sev-
eral types of multimedia and ubimedia interfaces and to adapt new tools easily.
Fifth Principle  We recommend, in our societies based on individualism, the con-
ception of all design artefacts dedicated to the ubiquitous imagination of solutions 
and actions be supported by design tools. Also it should encourage collaboration 
and cultural diversity respect and it should help resolve social conflicts. Current 
social media created an explosion of a sort of cooperation between individuals: 
communication. But these communication activities are too simple to significantly 
support and validate certain types of collaboration activities necessary to the con-
struction of organizations and digital social systems dedicated to innovation in all 
sorts of Internet communities. Our approach, just like numerous authors who write 
about innovation through economic development validation, insists on the develop-
ment of creativity and imagination ability. We must be able to transcend the present 
state of systems to imagine better ones. Designers everywhere can act as social cata-
lysts; knowledge appropriation organizers of a larger number of people can exploit 
the innovative power of ubimedia in their everyday life. In the long term, winning 
1  Global Transformation and Design Principles in the Knowledge Society

societies are not exclusively the ones that rationalize socio-economic processes but 
also the ones that optimize them while imagining new ones. The discovery does not 
come from the status quo nor the denial of favourable change either but from con-
ceptual bifurcations that combine memory, rationalization, reflection and 
imagination.
Sixth Principle  We recommend virtual organizations and digital social systems to 
be more than information systems or knowledge management. They have to be 
designed to include several points of view; they have to be integrated in a horizontal 
(bottom-up) manner and not exclusively hierarchical (top-down), according to the 
standardization model and the control concept of traditional computing manage-
ment. Their design must include common languages and semantics we can combine 
with specialized languages proper to engineers and programmers. The natural lan-
guage can serve as a base of collaborative design for the most part. It provides dia-
logue modes to a design thinking that suggests exploratory spaces and widens 
anticipated uses, and, above all, it is not limited to only one functionality. These 
modes promote activities of numerous virtual communities and are not limited to 
the closed circle of experts. In the knowledge society, the activity of collaborative 
artefact co-creation is not only similar to a language in the sense where different 
ubimedia tools are freely customizable, reconfigurable and reproducible. In the 
stronger sense of digital communication, design is the power to collectively gener-
ate new practices by natural langue use. Our approach aims to create a bridge 
between natural languages and expert languages, while lifting the barrier of codifi-
cation and mathematics programming languages. We must be aware of the fact that 
a design mandate is given by the spoken and written language and that the stake-
holders’ roles are evaluated and negotiated by diverse dialogue modes. The instruc-
tions given to computer engineers are written that the projects are presented in the 
form of charts, diagrams, figures and text. The decision-making is elaborated with 
the help of scenarios and synthesis software encouraging deliberations, that needs 
are caught by tales and that the participants’ requirements are evaluated from tales 
of exemplary practices, etc. Throughout the book we emphasize on the fact that the 
community must be able to use its own language to contribute to the projects’ ori-
entation and to ensure its values’ respect, while following the evolution of various 
projects. Each design or scientific field specialty asked to contribute to an innova-
tion project contains, of course, its “specialized jargon”. However, even if these 
jargons are necessary, the various stakeholders must have access to their own speech 
and literature, assuming, of course, we are convinced of the necessity of their demo-
cratic participation in these innovation projects. The community informatics design 
semantics issue, as mainly communication design instead of exclusively centred on 
experts’ languages, possesses its own discourse.
We recommend to researchers from different backgrounds, practitioners or 
designers, from pure sciences, human science or the artistic field, to recognize the 
mainly communication and linguistics nature of their effort so the projects are more 
debated in public and recognized worldwide and that they benefit from evaluative 
techniques understood by all. This is why we suggest (Harvey 2017 online) a first

collaborative technologies and cyber-collaboration lexicon. The dialogue allowed 
by the list of these first terms thus becomes a citizen participation tool in the cre-
ation of platforms and artefacts. To this effect, our group suggests long method-
ological developments around discovery matrix and strategic alignment, various 
types of users can build together, in a convivial and rigorous way, to better under-
stand the complexity of digital systems they suggest to build.
Seventh Principle  Throughout the book, we put forwards the idea that design 
must be “centred on the human being” and achieved by networking innovation com-
munities inside these communities and through them. This means design is formed 
according to a second-class systemic evolutive culture, namely, the understanding 
the designer has regarding the user’s comprehension. In this spirit, designers from 
social sciences, pure sciences or different artistic disciplines should be concerned 
by the first instance and not by technology itself but by the way technologies are 
understood and utilized by various stakeholders. The understanding engineers from 
all backgrounds bring to the world is generally very different from the users. 
Community informatics designers must apprehend both at the same time, according 
to different design contexts. All design activity is a communication activity under-
stood as a “contextualization” of human activities supported by technology, to para-
phrase our colleague Mucchielli (2005, 2006). All the effort of the present book 
consists of clarifying and listing elements and components related to technology in 
terms of infrastructural characteristics, architecture and product/service/application 
functionalities of digital social systems. Furthermore, without having to be a com-
munication and social sciences specialist, computer specialists and engineers must 
better understand the role of key concepts such as relations, reports, interaction, 
interactivity, socio-technologies, socio-communication factors, social architecture, 
socialization, collaboration, cooperation, coordination, etc. from the various scien-
tific field standpoint. The research must mobilize all stakeholders and not only engi-
neers, computer specialists or software creators. For example, in the next years to 
come, it will be more and more usual to see different types of engineers collaborat-
ing with different types of social scientists.
Eighth Principle  Design and more specifically socio-technical designs – interac-
tive, participative, empathic, emancipator, collaborative, semantics and community 
design – are a body of disciplines and methodological processes, a body of expertise 
that must constantly be expanded. This is why they suggest a collective duty of 
training young people, a distributed training made available to millions of users. It 
is the participative democratic philosophy that underlies the massive expansion 
movement on the Internet but also the need for new learning they generate. The 
word processing and electronic publication tools have made traditional graphic arts 
obsolete. Web design is often done by non-professionals who do not have a specific 
training. The computer fiddler succeeds better at certain website projects than 
designers that are trained in a school or university. The analysis of our online ques-
tionnaire results widely that Web design has become an increasingly universal 
human activity. Designers cannot stay, for a long time, far or in front of users, 
­especially when we mention organizations or digital social systems. If we deeply 
1  Global Transformation and Design Principles in the Knowledge Society

11
want these design skills to serve improvement and prosperity for all, we will have to 
speak not only a language understood by all but also encourage the training of many 
regarding understanding and implantation of design processes dedicated to innova-
tion. The community informatics design discipline and its foundations have a lot to 
offer to collaborative processes – pragmatic, epistemology, evolutive systems theo-
ries, plural analysis methodology, instantiation and co-creativity. It possesses a 
unique world vision and approach to our global issues related to our connected and 
interconnected societies. It suggests a way of validating individual autodidactic 
principle and self-organization of communities and users/designers. But to collec-
tively benefit from these advantages of this major cultural movement, we have to 
encourage this process at all tiers of the education field. How?
Ninth Principle  Design education must adopt a wider vision of design centred on 
the human being. Therefore, it must expand by leaving the design and engineering 
faculties to extend to all fields and professions most likely to benefit from it:
	(a)	 The education ministries, government agencies and universities have to encour-
age the training of transdisciplinary research teams and community informatics 
design development to support the birth of new social and organization struc-
tures in all activities where they seem relevant to validation or change.
	(b)	 Financing agencies like the ministère de l’Enseignement supérieur, de la 
Recherche, de la Science et de la Technologie du Québec (MESRST), as well as 
the industry in the broader sense should play a more important role in the 
assignment of budgets according to socio-technical large-scale projects that 
centralize their efforts towards building organizations and digital social systems 
equipped with better technical and psychosocial qualities. These environments 
should experiment with partnerships, not only bipartite like the companies-­
universities but multipartite, like the ones we call the “five helix partnerships”. 
They dynamically include the complementary complexity of at least five stake-
holders: citizens, entrepreneurs, government agencies actors, universities and 
environment and sustainable development specialists.
	(c)	 We must establish courses that prepare various professionals, including design-
ers, to better understand the communication, cognitive, social, cultural and 
technological factors at different levels of society, global networking individu-
als as well as groups, communities and organizations in different space-time. 
Visualization, modeling and evaluation methodological tools should be taught 
as a priority in social and human sciences and become an integral element of all 
education programs, from primary school to university. This transdisciplinary 
challenge has very important implications for remote education everywhere on 
our territory: the dissemination of results, the access to remote publics, mentor-
ing and supervising techniques, tutorials and online facilitation are particularly 
targeted sectors.
	(d)	 At the end of their community informatics design projects, students should be 
encouraged to present their logbooks, reviews, reports, summaries and case 
studies that document their practice and suggest feedback. Eventually, these 
activities of reflexive practice, promising development gathering, collective tale

12
writing, content editing and application design and imagining new solutions to 
large-scale issues could contribute to rekindle the desire for a well-structured 
thinking, well-written and well-tailored reports, a deep logic in the organization 
of ideas and the dissemination of better practices to the largest number of peo-
ple possible.
	(e)	 The dissemination and appropriation of ideas of collaborative informatics 
design could benefit greatly to national strategic design workshops at the dis-
posal of economy and innovation. An annual international symposium on 
design validation effects in all economic activity sectors could be held in vari-
ous cities in Quebec via telephone and video conferencing, according to the 
global and local development issues and contexts. The profile of future design-
ers suggested by Ostrom and Hess (2011), Robbin (2011), Hofkirchner (2010), 
Fuchs (2008), Siemens (2005a, b), Kling (2002) and Schön (1992), to name 
only a few, could be widened and extended to sciences that have no real ties 
with the design field yet, from the principles that are emerging from our 
introduction.
Tenth Principle  The APSI program should be accompanied by other subsidy pro-
grams and supported by a transdisciplinary research that, in addition to suggest 
products and infrastructure production programs, will also make this type of design 
a partner of all socio-economic innovation stakeholders, according to the collabora-
tive culture philosophy of “community informatics design centred on the human 
being” and the structuring perspective of sustainable development.
Seven research orientations could contribute to rephrase the reference frame-
work of socio-technical systems and activate the fields of knowledge that will guide 
Quebec towards the ongoing revolution. These seven fields call on the institutional 
commitment of several partners and include various operational action propositions. 
Here are the five most important:
	(a)	 A support to preliminary research through the organization of various national 
strategic workshop
	(b)	 The opening of strategic funds for exploratory research in order to stimulate the 
R-D applications and concrete propositions
	(c)	 The creation of an implementation funds, to instantiate and deploy flourishing 
projects in the development of virtual organizations and digital social systems 
through community informatics design
	(d)	 Workshops to evaluate projects and exemplary practices to create evaluation 
and validity tools and to compare the results obtained with the use of ubimedia 
and collaborative tools
	(e)	 Establishment of new structured partners in multiple stakeholders’ helix, in 
order to create new institutions like the Quebec digital platform and the demo-
cratic and participative knowledge platforms in numerous fields
When governments and industries decide to sponsor researches on the creation 
of new high school and university classes or research programs, they should specify 
the work must be executed by integrated teams in partnership with several 
1  Global Transformation and Design Principles in the Knowledge Society

13
­disciplines. Each one should be relevant and able to face the numerous issues related 
to the development, planning, production, implementation and validation of ubime-
dia projects. This way, we would encourage a change in the paradigm of research 
project conduct. The traditional scientific paradigm emerged during the 
Enlightenment. It was engaging researchers in the idea of mechanism and analysis 
of past facts. Research meant “re-search”, and it meant search the past, the already 
there, again and again, to find rules, laws and empirical constraints that would help 
us survive in the present while helping determine our future. In contrast, “the com-
munication design thinking” suggested by the current community informatics 
design movement described in our works on “ubiquitous imagination” suggests a 
future vision while researching present orientations. This requirement would send a 
clear message to university researchers and encourage new approaches and the cre-
ation of new research structures in community informatics design. More specifi-
cally, our group recommends the systematic articulation and elaboration of a new 
research paradigm: the “imaginatics”. This could lead to a generalized national 
effort towards the creation of a unifying reference framework based on the crossing 
roads between computer sciences, social and communication sciences and com-
plexity sciences. This program would suggest methodological approaches and 
would give a logical and economic justifications to a research in community infor-
matics design committed to action around ideas like research activities oriented 
towards the future and the creation of new artefacts helping the design of digital 
social systems (DSS) that would create new infrastructures based on this paradigm, 
especially in information and communication sciences.
Government agencies such as the Secrétariat du Conseil du Trésor or ministries 
like the MESRST, as well as the media, electronic and telecommunication industry, 
should play an important role by sponsoring major transdisciplinary projects to 
develop a second-order design science, a sort of science of the artificial, in the 
design sciences sense, as understood by Herbert Simon (1960, 1962, 1969, 1974, 
1996). Half a century ago, he wrote that technology and information developments 
were beyond the horizon of all citizens. These design sciences must be extended by 
all sorts of means to a very wide socio-scientific whole, in a way to better under-
stand the various uses of technology by diverse stakeholders, as well as users/
designers and engineers from various fields, and the determination of what each one 
can bring to the ubimedia universe and collaborative platforms. Qualitatively, the 
research aiming for the comprehension of cultural and technological socio-dynamic 
put at the service of social and economic innovation is very different from the 
research on technology itself, as it is practiced in pure sciences.
Together, under the direction of its scientist in chief, the Quebec scientific com-
munity could put the shoulder to the wheel and establish a second-order and third-­
phase design science” (Bausch and Flanagan 2013) that could combine the following 
concepts: an imaginatics, in the sense of The Club of Rome, aiming to introduce a 
new thinking, supported by networking and ubimedia, that would consist of taking 
into account all patterns ubiquitous imagination rely on to design a new conceptual 
and pragmatic order of new organizational initiatives like the Quebec digital plat-
form. Clearly said, the simplistic sequencing of integrator concepts in a dictionary, 
1.2  The New Design Principles Emerging from Our Works

14
even Wikipedia, or even showcasing the values of the first and second phase science 
is not suitable to all research situations. Currently, sociohistorical conditions encour-
age the integration of creativity tools of collaborative ubimedia in this imaginatics 
and their interaction models and design put at the services of the sharing economy, 
which will meet an obvious need. This integration and its patterns resonate in a 
“polyphonic” way, much better adapted to the complex reality such as apprehended 
by new generations of researchers. We observe everywhere the enthusiasm the 
social Web, collaborative technologies and the future ubimedia provoke throughout 
the world. But we also notice their potential perverse effects. This is why we simul-
taneously create a “resolutics” that suggests Quebec’s approach be integrated at all 
levels of society, inside an environment with global perspectives that command 
interactive solutions and collaborative news to resolve our local issues. The global 
intervention methodology suggested by the community informatics design includes 
an “imaginatics” that allows to harness the massive knowledge production towards 
the needs of our society, while “resolutics” accompany it while creating a richer 
representational bridge between the conceptual framework and multi-aspect instan-
tiation strategies. Thus creating the need to have more researches on a new domain 
called “Identics”, following an expression created by The Club of Rome (and taken 
up by Anthony Judge 2008a) to define imaginative metaphors, standards and proce-
dures, the culture and identities of innovative communities of practice and their 
specific ways of organizing work and to understand imaginative patterns and par-
ticular innovation modes in a given society, all this will facilitate the planning of 
more original digital strategies in a specific country. New online social systems and 
organizations we create in Quebec refer to ways of learning, learning to do, to be 
and to live together that are proper to the Quebec society and that contribute to the 
dissemination, sharing and the production of a whole new digital cultural identity: 
the digital Quebecer “identics”.
At this time of globalization of cultures and economy, the ways of living together 
are not exclusively defined inside a territory but throughout the multiple learning 
enterprise networks in the Peter Senge’s sense (1990, 2006, 2013) through new 
learning practices and research whose boundaries are not confined to well-defined 
spaces like research centres, universities, schools or companies. While contributing 
to keep the intellectual leadership of existing institutions, the new knowledge soci-
ety institutions are blasting through their boundaries’ limits to project outside and 
practice the communityship by helping citizens of all horizons to increase their digi-
tal knowledge and skills in all fields. We must understand the way the cultural and 
social governance is influenced by innovation communities like wiki, DSS and vir-
tual organizations of all kinds. How is our culture influenced by new artefacts and 
collaborative culture born in global networks and social Web? How is our society 
evolving dynamically between different spaces (physical, mental, social cyberspa-
tial), with regard to its structures and operating in the new “identics” process frame-
work? We must collectively channel and orientate these new participative behaviours 
in a sense that will be strategically favourable in the long term. We cannot remain 
confined in the appropriation of the Anglo-Saxon culture without risking to remain 
imprisoned in it. We must pay attention to Quebec’s global image that is created in 
1  Global Transformation and Design Principles in the Knowledge Society

15
the world collaborative networks and to symbolic and imaginative devices of all 
sorts issued from our culture and that innervate the planet. The unawareness or 
ignorance facing these new socio-communication situations and the emergence of 
these new international identity expression systems of at various levels of society 
can have unexpected socio-economic consequences.
This new international identics of such complexity we cannot predict in one 
workshop or in one symposium only. We can, however, better define it if we con-
sider it as a particular initiatives’ attractor/unifying, if we understand it like a fifth 
discipline (Senge 1990, 2006) added to the fourth other pillars of the new research 
paradigm: the problematic, the community informatics design, the imaginatics and 
the resolutics. This requires the elaboration of a national director plan that allows to 
understand the perspectives in all their complexity.
These five pillars of research and development (problematic, community infor-
matics design, imaginatics, resolutics and identics) rest upon a brand new research 
paradigm of the second-order systemic and a third-phase collaborative intermodal 
science. They command a whole new semantics and communication approach of 
the human-computer interface, which becomes the fourth big research focus on 
which the Quebec digital platform can rely on to ensure its future. The socio-­
communicational and semantics design of DSS relies on a natural, user-friendly, 
motivating approach that does not require specific computer or mathematics skills. 
We believe we have widely supported this argument in our study, and we strongly 
wish this approach becomes the chosen way to grasp the multiple modalities and 
aspects related to the community informatics design centred on the human being. 
Figure 1.1 illustrates this socio-dynamic process aiming at the maturation of the 
third-phase science five pillars: the community informatics design.
Therefore, we suggest the seven research orientations and axis development, 
articulated on a generic platform of collaboration and social creativity to be 
determined:
	1.	 Develop an evolutive and interactive semantics link networks, a sense and mean-
ing theory that emerges from the application arena and grounds at the same time 
as visual information representation systems such as Stella.
	2.	 Co-build a stakeholder’s theory replacing the old consumer/user model to 
reframe it in a partnership network (partnership helix) of proactive users/design-
ers well informed, well trained and intrinsically motivated by certain types of 
innovation or applications supported by networking and the elaboration of resil-
ient social systems, self-organized and well adapted to the new socio-economic 
situation of the knowledge society. We must conduct workshops that will unite 
scientists of various horizons, business people, people who define government 
policies and citizen communities interested in this challenge.
	3.	 Extend the suggested vocabulary in this book to products, applications and ser-
vices in order to make it “applicable or usable” in an appropriate way by large 
segments of the population coming from diverse domains or sectors of activities 
such as information, organization, social or virtual.
	4.	 Continue the effort we undertook in the formalizing of DSS instantiation process 
and semi-formalizing socio-technical design by discovery matrices and strategic

alignment. We absolutely must try to computerize the multiple domains of 
­community informatics design that will help stakeholders to better understand 
the DSS activities and the design process.
	5.	 Improve social media analytics techniques and collaborative and ubimedia tools 
to reach a level of strictness comparable to the one found in architecture or 
applied sciences.
	6.	 Organize conventions and workshops in person or via tele-presence and produce 
new reports according to a new formula that favours action for the future instead 
of past assessments.
	7.	 Publish books, manuals and journals on community informatics and semantics 
innovation.
Throughout the APSI research, transdisciplinarity is made for one of the key 
problematic of our partnerships, our workshops and questionnaires. The informa-
tion applications are so complex that they can simply not be designed or created 
without a collaboration that would go outside the disciplinary borders. Therefore, 
we recommend, and it is also in line with the Secrétariat du Conseil du Trésor du 
Québec’s policies, to intensify the multidirectional and multimodal research effort 
on the major projects of the twenty-first century that, while remaining largely preoc-

cupied by science and technology, is in line with the reflection and social imagination 
solutions for major socio-economic projects defined by the Science Technology and 
Society Sector (STS) and the Finances et de l’Économie du Québec ministry. Once 
again, we illustrate the great research axis by orientations likely to guide the policy 
planning (Fig.  1.2), by taking as an example our healthcare system, articulated 
around the five pillars previously mentioned (problematics, community informatics 
design, imaginatics, resolutics and identics) and its multi-domain governance mode.
To develop projects focused on thematic related to sciences, technologies and 
great twenty-first-century social projects and the five pillars’ synthetic vision of 
informatics design and imaginatics, we suggest the following innovations:
	1.	 Create Collaboratories Articulated in Innovation Network Design Centres. A 
proposition would be to develop a virtual design studio; another one would be to 
link education programs in order to improve the general quality of educational 
resources for all participants around the innovative projects involving various 
types of design.
	2.	 Increase the Collaborative Software Creation. The current collaborative tools 
are more and more abundant, but they are not adapted to the various users’/
designer’s complex tasks. More specifically, the effort should focus on accompa-

nying specialized collaboration with experts/creators who work in smart organi-
zations around complex projects.
	3.	 Develop Procedures. Rules and standards as we have them in our research should 
be taught and adopted by people who must work together to improve collabora-
tion, whether within complex partnerships of all sorts or virtual teams dedicated 
to creating collaborative tools based on their experience in different spaces and 
places, real or virtual.
	4.	 Explore Techniques to Appoint and Facilitate Stakeholders in a Design Process 
with the Help of Socio-collaborative Media. Often, people with an interest in 
technology express it openly but will not commit implicitly in reflection activi-
ties about the design process without facilitation or sociocultural facilitation.
	5.	 Validate New Types of Citizenship in the Future, Around the Co-creation of 
Democratic Citizen Platforms Dedicated to Innovation. The current notions 
related to the citizenship concept in the public arena generally refer to the act of 
“voting” in the name of a known concept but very badly defined: “democracy”. 
Information technologies and the social participation publicized by Internet net-
works contain a radical transformation potential of political processes, between 
the market and the state. It is of the highest importance to develop digital social 
systems in what the American political researchers call “the third sector”, within 
which groups and communities that can self-organize in “Commons” and recre-
ate flexible processes where they can become real political actors again and 
actively participate in diverse activities of various government tiers.
We recommend cutting-edge research that will take into account conceptual 
frameworks better suited to information, communication and collaboration’s ­current 
reality. The old consensus on the Shannon and Weaver transmitter receiver’s para-
digm theory left us speechless for the portals and virtual organization design. The 
semantics and semiotics models presented in this research, like the semio-­pragmatic 
communication star and the CAPACITÉS model, are there to correct the situation. 
They help us to better define concepts like information and knowledge and to con-
sider the multiple disciplines that help design and document as well as the various 
modalities of knowledge sharing through new digital social systems. Throughout 
this book, we suggest to build solid conceptual pillars, like the evolutive system 
theory, social systems design, the theory of activity and conversational design, to 
name only the most important ones. We propose an in-depth research that concep-
tualizes, again, the information and knowledge notions through new virtual organi-
zations semantics, networking institutions and the digital social systems that update 
them every day in all sorts of human activity systems. We must better understand the 
way ICT and technology are related to their users/designers.
The current blur that conceals information notions and shared knowledge put at 
the service of human development invites us to consider creativity and design tools 
from another angle. Instead of confining them in specific disciplines or specialized 
niches, we should consider them like prodigious innovation tools in cyberspace and 
inter-enterprise collaborative networks. These new technologies and social plat-
forms are not there only to validate everyday human relations and communications, 
1  Global Transformation and Design Principles in the Knowledge Society

this task being of a great social benefit in itself. Their strength resides in their poten-
tial for the collaboration in complex projects and the support of governance and 
coordination processes of numerous semantic link networks. Coordination of indi-
vidual citizen activities, of people, of groups and of communities is made of col-
laborative networks and virtual social systems of all sorts. Also, it could sustain the 
coordination of material and social entities in different spaces like in the growing 
Internet of Things, creating new socio-technological ecosystems like the telecom-
munication industry. The coordination of collaboratories is dedicated to the devel-
opment of new economic models that numerous organizations can benefit from, 
when they are struggling with creating new economic models. This new understand-
ing of governance and coordination possibilities through ICT, human activities and 
innovation ubimedia is new and must be explored at all levels of society. We recom-
mend developing around the concepts such as governance, semantics, ethics and 
coordination, from theories like social and communicational sciences, complexity 
sciences and computer sciences.
To justify the role of community informatics design at the service of our society 
well, we must propose a new vocabulary and logical arguments likely to convince 
various stakeholders so they will find their interest and benefit. Better-established 
disciplines like computer sciences and information sciences have developed an 
entire intellectual technology to instantiate their models and implant their projects. 
Others, like engineering and medicine, put their propositions to the test and have 
developed techniques to evaluate their products and applications. The creation of a 
vocabulary, standards and evaluation tools for the design of future digital social 
systems represents a considerable intellectual challenge, and our research reveals 
certain bases and numerous applications. Because the development and co-design 
of such collaborative online social systems require the participation of several peo-
ple and users’/designers’ communities, at levels never seen before and including 
spaces of activities of higher risks, the need for technical instantiation and evalua-
tion becomes a priority. In this context, we recommend developing analysis and 
design criteria up to the challenges we are identifying as well as rigorous and rele-
vant evaluation techniques for all interested groups by promoting a motivating eval-
uation that does not divert from the values of community informatics design centred 
on the human.
1.3  New Skills, Social Creativity and Innovation
In this section, we organize our remarks according to two main reasoning lines:
	1.	 A Succinct but Virulent Critique of the Current Theory Deficiency Explaining the 
Relation Between Technology and Society: Everything remains to be done 
regarding the collective design skills awareness that can help having a real demo-
cratic participation in the orientation of current social changes.
1.3  New Skills, Social Creativity and Innovation

20
	2.	 Social and Communication Sciences as an Essential Basic Necessary Knowledge 
Source to Orientate Change: If we seriously consider increasing the collective 
design skills, as an emancipating human activity system, we must demonstrate 
how it works and how it can be applied in the context of our lives and social, 
technological and economic systems. We direct our attention towards ten 
researchers that seem to be making innovative ways.
We will show how the “8-C” theoretical framework can meet the needs of new 
knowledge production for the analysis and development of digital social systems 
while providing basic concepts to create the community informatics design founda-
tions. Community informatics design aims to respond to the pressing need to create 
a new complexity and co-design science regarding the evolution of technologies and 
digital social systems. This new face of social sciences and applied communication 
sciences cannot only provide a new interpretation of ongoing social transformations 
but also orientate them at various levels of society.
We will define a theoretical framework for the analysis of new online virtual 
organizations and social architecture likely to help model and evaluate them. To 
deepen questions related to potential links of new social structures in line with the 
economy and society, we must explore the complexity of collaboration mechanisms 
and their validation effects on human capital, organizational, technological and rela-
tional of our societies. The “intermodal architecture” notion is part of the array of 
creativity tools made available for future researchers in social sciences.
Finally, we will show the perspectives presented to us with the Web 3.0, the inno-
vation Web. The new knowledge produced by community informatics design and 
the orchestration of a stakeholders’ plurality, of architectures and of methodologies 
and creativity tools implies a new knowledge production paradigm through which 
innovation is channelled in a new research plan, where the five partnership helix 
model is socially inserted in networks, meaning spheres, a programming of com-
munity information systems oriented towards semantics aspects instead of object 
only. This plan of action is based on needs, skills, activities and typologies of the 
virtual communities we have discovered during our research by sociological survey 
and by case study:
	1.	 Continuing education in the knowledge society (Chap. 2)
	2.	 Virtual communities as socio-technical systems: reference model, management 
and methodology implementation theoretical framework
By using a life cycle inspired by the information systems design field and by 
extending it to the community information systems, our first task was to review the 
virtual community research and to suggest a succession of phases aligned with the 
development phases of the social systems design theory, allowing us to present suc-
cessful conditions of the implementation of innovation communities in various 
socio-economic environments. The basic idea of our approach was to observe all the 
community development phases from initiation until metamorphosis or dissolution, 
for the purpose of increasing their chances to become dynamic and healthy

­communities, whose members actively participate in content and design creation of 
various elements and their process.
At the beginning of the second decade of the twenty-first century, the Internet is 
the dominant media for information exchange and social communication. For over 
15 years, millions of Quebecers, Canadians and Americans use it daily for various 
information researches and communication activities at work, at home and in their 
community. They read the news, check the weather forecast, visit health websites, 
exchange in diverse communities, play all sorts of games and refer to maps and 
research travel destinations. Several play additional roles and become information 
providers, beyond traditional professional barriers. With their new skills, they con-
tribute to arrange contents on a wide array of topics in networks blogs, wiki and 
more recently in the new complex spaces of the Internet of Things and Places. 
Today in 2017, social interaction is the most popular one for the majority of Internet 
users. For 150 million of Internet users in the United States, 91 % go online to stay 
in touch with friends, colleagues and people they know in the physical world. This 
majority also includes people who use the Internet and collaborative networks to 
co-build new forms of relationships online with people they have never met in per-
son but with whom they have common interests. Users play games of all sorts, visit 
all sorts of websites where they can chat, participate in discussion forums or meet-
ing spaces and visit social network websites to meet different people. All these 
people contribute to the collaborative network design of all sorts in multiple seman-
tics link network, which go from the interest community to the socio-economic 
innovation community through a wide variety of organizations such as virtual 
teams, strategic alliances, technology parks, emerging digital social systems and 
business ecosystems.
As a matter of fact, collaborative semantics networks currently emerge according 
to an array of configurations and sociometric forms that create numerous digital 
social systems such as virtual organizations, virtual communities, virtual collabora-
tories, living laboratories, network-enterprise partnerships, more or less sustainable 
industrial clusters, experimental social environments and digital social systems sup-
port (Camarinha-Matos and Afsarmanesh 2004, 2005; Afsarmanesh and Camarinha-
Matos 2005, 2008). These “new organizational forms” are not new. In our PhD 
work (Harvey 1993) as well as in Harvey’s 1996 book dedicated to the emergence 
of virtual communities in the cyberspace, we were asking the following question: 
“Were Free-Nets at that time prefiguring an emerging and sustainable phenomenon 
or only short-lived social organization forms according to a more or less important 
trend”? In the present book, we will try to provide a more systematic answer. The 
starting point of our research is anchored in the transdisciplinary questioning that 
went to research fields we find under various designations: social computing, com-
munity computing, collaborative networks and now social Web or social media, 
Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems. Domain names are not lacking to 
qualify these new social life and organizational environments. Even if search results 
show that all virtual communities do not have a high structure degree, most collab-
orative networks necessarily involve a type of organization in their activities and 
their entities (things and places) that create new forms of social systems we call 
1.3  New Skills, Social Creativity and Innovation

“digital social systems”. Digital social systems know how to identify the roles of 
their participants, their member’s status, deliberation procedure, a division and a 
coordination of work and certain governance rules. Some may have set up very 
specialized mechanisms for socio-economic innovation support. In this case, they 
cannot only form collaborative networks but generate business organizations and 
new networked institutions. These new collaborative network organizations have 
been the object of many research projects as well as national and international ini-
tiatives everywhere in the world, and a large data and empiric knowledge package 
is accessible on the subject. However, our documentary researches show us the 
urgency to consolidate this knowledge and to build better disciplinary foundations 
to optimize the development of this research sector.
The lack of reference models to apprehend network collaborative organizations 
as well as their manifestations in the form of various online social structures (like 
virtual enterprises, virtual professional communities, learning by project communi-
ties) represents a common concern for the research groups in the related fields like 
community informatics, social computing and the STS sector. This shortcoming in 
terms of theories, models and theory/practice (Harvey 2008) is highlighted as an 
obstacle in the consolidation of the studies we referred to as research on the Internet 
and society, in the broad sense of the ICT impact, the uses and the design in the 
society, the economy and the knowledge in particular in the community information 
systems sector.
In Quebec, for a few decades now, we have developed and operationalized cer-
tain technological development models around notions like technology parks, 
industrial clusters, enterprises incubators, strategic alliances and e-commerce or 
multimedia cities. These models appeared in common “socio-territories” or admin-
istrative regions by promoting the aggregation of diverse groups of organizations 
with the will to cooperate/collaborate to take advantage of business opportunities or 
potential markets that would never have seen the day or would have been too expen-
sive if tackled individually. These long-term strategic alliances were often limited to 
the geographic proximity to their members, who saw a way of creating an economic 
force, industrial reconciliation and more intangible benefits such as a shared culture 
facilitating expertise exchanges and a sense of community belonging.
Alongside these private/public economic development initiatives, an entire 
movement we have identified in 1992 and 1993 under the name of “virtual com-
munities”, following the works of Howard Rheingold (1993), and that we had 
developed in Quebec under the name of “community informatics” since 1984, 
almost 10  years before our American and European colleagues, as part of our 
research work with Michel Cartier (2002) and Kimon Valaskakis (1988, 2010), 
quickly showed that the notion of community and network had to be clarified as a 
complex system containing communication, sociological and technological dimen-
sions. Despite the language barriers or the absence of international diffusion in 
English, the Quebec expertise quickly crossed the borders to reach countries like 
France, Belgium, the United States and some African countries (Harvey and 
Bertrand 2004; Harvey 2004b). The impact of the first Electronic Bulletin Boards 
(BBS) and now the Web collaborative tools also called “social media” on virtual 
1  Global Transformation and Design Principles in the Knowledge Society

communities training must be not only revised with respect to theories and practices 
specific to the field (Fuchs 2010; Hofkirchner 2007, 2008, 2013; Wellman 2002; 
Benkler 2006; Castells 2011; Shneiderman 2002; Preece and Shneiderman 2008; 
Preece and Maloney-Krichmar 2005; Preece et al. 2004; Shneiderman and Preece 
2008; Sunstein 2006; Lovink 2007; Gurstein 2008; Wilson 2006) but also to per-
spectives like the collaborative semantics networks and platforms that open to the 
social creativity fields (Romero et al. 2008; Molina et al. 2007; Fischer and Konomi 
2007; Camarinha-Matos and Afsarmanesh 2005, 2006, 2008; Camarinha-Matos 
et al. 2005a, b) and to community informatics design. The ubiquitous imagination 
and collaborative intelligence’s promotion in virtual communities design are cur-
rently inviting consumers and users to become content producers and users/design-
ers of their own virtual communities, to contribute to the various phases of 
co-creation by crowdsourcing (finding collective solutions to common problem 
trend) open-source code design networks and practice communities.
For a few years, with the rapid ICT progression, accompanied by the market 
turbulence, economic chaos and business globalization, new forms of strategic alli-
ances and collaborative networks of all kinds are emerging more and more on the 
differentiation/integration basis principle in terms of practice communities or com-
munities of common interests. However, this principle must be completed by 
another important systemic principle: the unity of action in the diversity of organi-
zational cultures and spaces. This generic theoretical principles and several other 
integrator concepts of these new organizational realities can help us characterize 
new social information flows that take place in the socio-economic life of the net-
worked knowledge society. These new economic realities and the global markets 
influenced by ICT have a deep influence on all global social systems organizations, 
in particular small- and medium-sized enterprises which account for our basic 
industrial social fabric by giving the possibility to transgress traditional geographic 
borders and to form all kinds of “action communities”, which we outline in another 
section of this present book.
These action communities can take many forms and may belong to one or several 
local or international networks, in order to increase or consolidate their influence on 
global markets. The phenomenon is so quick and important that it requires wording 
of new theoretical and methodological transdisciplinary concepts, not only to ensure 
its cognitive mastery but also and mostly to allow the development and co-building 
of new social and virtual economics architectures. Therefore, we must propose an 
improved explanation of the social networking and innovation network phenomena 
resulting from it to better answer the business perspectives that arise on the global 
scale. The famous McLuhan’s global village is not at our door anymore but inside 
our homes. The new wealth of nations (Smith 2006) has become the wealth of net-
works (Benkler 2006). These new networks have to provide the necessary condi-
tions (e.g. human, social, financials, infrastructural and organizational) to quickly 
ensure, in a fluid and safe way, the establishment of new collaborative networks 
dedicated to innovation. The development of innovation communities we have 
observed for many years mainly focuses on co-creation of virtual environments 
appropriate for collaboration, the fulfilment of cooperation contracts and the

­redaction of common operations and actions principles. Also, the accelerated devel-
opment of collaborative and participative architectures that allow the implementa-
tion of common interoperable knowledge infrastructures, the co-building of 
collaborative ontologies and the sharing of knowledge, the development of trust and 
the sharing of many other resources, is actually exploding all around the world. The 
sharing of resources has the objective of preparing members, organizations, institu-
tions and partner local communities to collaborate in virtual innovation communi-
ties that will allow to realize a business opportunity, a new social relation or strong 
interactions around collaborative common projects.
Within these new contexts, community informatics design takes a growing 
importance while presenting new challenges to research in several relevant fields. 
Also, the creation of digital social systems by community informatics design allows 
to put into perspective new organizational structuring possibilities that aim to vali-
date different types of digital skills or to integrate new basic skills (analyse and 
synthesize information, arrange and share contents, configure software). All while 
observing the real effects of validation of these creation activities on learning new 
E-skills, acquiring knowledge or reducing some costs associated with particular 
projects such as the improvement of the services provided to the users’ and consum-
ers’ online practices. Once its particular mission is accomplished, the social system 
or the networked practice or digital innovation community will dissolve or will 
transform into a lasting structure different from the original one. This new social 
structure entangled in many different physical and virtual assemblages (Foucault) 
will be able to extend in time and in space by always integrating in its deployment 
more people, resources and data supported by the computer networks and social 
media.
1.4  Why the Design? Its Emergence in Communication 
Sciences
The principal aim of this book is to promote the design’s abductive thinking in all 
its multiple aspects as a mode of learning and acquiring skills in the information and 
communication fields (Aakhus 2007), in order to extract theories, practices and 
applications related to the communication process involved in the co-creation of 
environments, organizations and digital social systems. Design is a central element 
in communication and interconnective social action disciplines (Bennett and 
Segerberg 2013), and digital humanities under construction (Rosenbloom 2013) as 
well as several trades and professions are related: research/creation, 
research/intervention, facilitation, project management (Johannessen and Olsen 
2011), marketing and public relations. And yet, the designer’s work remains widely 
invisible in the field of teaching and research. The design work as such, whether it 
is media, publishing, graphic, visual or social coverage is often treated as a product 
of research, an application even a cultural product instead of a learning, creation,

composition, imagination or inspiration act (Aakhus 2007, 2010, 2013). We can 
quote many examples: the construction and development of effective health promo-
tion campaigns, the network collaboration in the social Web, the numerous works 
done to create new work organization forms, the recovery of organizational process 
design, the development of problem-solving methods or settlement of disputes and 
all the efforts dedicated to environment design for remote education and citizen 
platforms or sociocultural intervention promoting dialogues and debates. All trans-
disciplinary works related to work on information systems, to computer-based and 
to human-computer interfaces are skyrocketing. Nevertheless, the attentive examin-
ing of literature on the topic offers us many examples of studies carried out to evalu-
ate design products and applications, but there are very little written about concrete 
principles and processes leading to the completion of such products in social and 
communication sciences. With the present book, we would like to contribute to fill 
part of these shortcomings. This book is an invitation to reflect upon foundations, 
theories, methodologies and applications of the design thinking in a communica-
tional context and to join our future efforts to appreciate the impact on our practices, 
in order to suggest new conceptual frameworks in all spheres of social, public and 
digital communication.
1.5  The Detailed Presentation of the Book’s Chapters
The book is divided into two main parts: the first one is entitled “The field of com-
munity informatics design science: theoretical foundations of digital social systems 
design”. Throughout this first part, we seek to set the fundamental and communica-
tion basis of analysis and digital social systems of community informatics design.
The first part is divided into five chapters. This chapter presents universal anteri-
orities and the third-phase science. We lay the foundations of an exploratory research 
on ways to configure scientific knowledge and digital social systems’ design prac-
tices in the context of innovation by the co-design on the Internet. In order to guide 
this exploration through the jungle of fields, concepts, theories, methodologies and 
applications, our team resorted to a piece of work very little known by communica-
tion and social sciences practitioners. In our opinion, it is essential for the under-
standing of the foundations of this scientific domain, The Domain of Science Model, 
presented by John Nelson Warfield in 1986, and that will inspire several significant 
researchers in the field of social systems design such as Bela Banathy (1996), 
Alexander Christakis (1987, 2010), Kenneth Bausch (2006), Heiner Benking and 
James Rose (1998), Thomas Flanagan (Flanagan et al. 2012; Flanagan and Bausch 
2011; Flanagan and Christakis 2010), Alexander and Kathia Laszlo (2007) and 
many more. This model is at the basis of the masterful work of Warfield (1994), 
entitled A Science of Generic Design: Managing Complexity through System 
Design. Socio-­technical networks give light to a third-phase science, a participative 
science where all citizens can contribute democratically to socio-economic 
innovation.
1.5  The Detailed Presentation of the Book’s Chapters

26
In Chap. 2, after having presented the philosophical foundations of digital social 
systems’ community informatics design, we introduce “the community informatics 
design’s general theoretical basis” that help understand some important orientations 
of community informatics design as a “socio-technical science”. A typology of 
principles that is behind this type of design is also presented, as well as a certain 
number of laws and axioms that accompany its development. We thus try to bring a 
general reference framework out as wells as a socio-technical design perspective 
anchored in strong traditions of a society of participative, collaborative, sharing, 
durable and responsible information similar to the Scandinavian participate design 
tradition. Our approach is semi-normative, because it does not encourage any type 
of information society but a society aiming at the values supported by both World 
Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in Geneva in 2003 and in Tunis in 2005, 
which includes desirable qualities by a set of countries, fields and professions con-
cerning management and knowledge sharing and quality of life.
The community informatics designer’s task is to develop and anchor in the foun-
dations presented in our two first chapters a “socially responsible communication 
design science”, like Victor Papanek and his successors.
Chapter 4 features ways to put “community informatics design in action”. We 
thus review several modes of operational thinking to start a design process. The field 
of science model (FOSM) allows us now to provide theoretical and practical foun-
dations of an operational collective imagination process, “community informatics 
design”. We show here that it is an exploratory travel through numerous thinking 
and action modes supported by transdisciplinarity and pragmatic, no more, no less. 
We suggest seven reflection modes that represent a very concrete way to operation-
alize design thinking (Burnette 2009; Ranjan 2007), and they can help the uniniti-
ated or students in social and communication sciences to start a design process. 
These seven reflection modes constitute an operating model that can intervene at 
any stages of the FOSM, his life cycle and design project phases. Each reflection 
mode is articulated in different natural or specialized languages and takes into con-
sideration a different aspect of the FOSM (foundations, theories, methodologies and 
various applications). Each contains characteristics allowing to provide specific 
information and knowledge suitable for each instance, procedures or actions related 
to FOSM. In fact, this concretely means that each reflection mode allows to opera-
tionalize different users’/designers’ intentions, their behaviours, standards, archi-
tectures, role identification, resource and management modes, values, etc. Going 
forwards, these reflection modes could help to reconcile computer science and 
social science vocabulary.
Chapter 5 presents a generic communication model adapted to community infor-
matics design called the “semio-pragmatic communication star”. This seven-pointed 
star allows to analyse and design socio-technical systems in a more exhaustive way 
than traditional communication models that neglect several important aspects of 
human behaviour. After the model presentation, we attempt to integrate it after-
wards to an experimental evaluation model in the form of “hierarchical stairs” of 
interdependent fields we call CAPACITÉS: (Constellation d’attributs pour l’analyse 
et la construction interactive des technologies éducatives standardisées) 
1  Global Transformation and Design Principles in the Knowledge Society

27
Constellation of Attributes for the Analysis and the Interactive Construction of 
Educational Standardized Technologies.
Our analysis of the elements related to the development of communication pro-
cesses involved in the co-creation of socio-technical platforms seeks to result in 
useful norms (like basic architectures in Chap. 6) at various types of collaborative 
design. The implementation of standardized rules, transcultural and transdisci-
plinary, provides a bridge between learning processes performed with the help of 
different languages (animated images, symbols, diagrams, figures, natural or spe-
cialized languages), first moments of a communication and learning platform 
deployment by community informatics design and, transdisciplinary communica-
tion operationalized by these different languages, second moment of a learning plat-
form deployment considered as an eloquent digital social system. It relies on our 
previous works (Harvey 2010; Harvey and Bertrand 2004; Harvey and Lemire 
2001) dedicated to establishing a “dynamic appropriation” communication model 
as well as the APSI works realized with our partner Lionel Audant from Unimasoft. 
We use the education sector and learning communication platforms as an example 
in order to make the abstract platform reality more accessible to the reader.
Chapter 5 outlines the major points of a collaborative design scientific approach 
and suggests the first transdisciplinary architecture norms of a community informat-
ics help system SADC (système d’aide au design communautique) as a collabora-
tive platform development support we call digital social systems. Collaborative 
design has become one of the main challenges in several fields of study, especially 
social sciences, communication, physics, computer sciences and even biology and 
ecosystems. Designers want to create systems where several entities (organizations, 
communities, groups and individuals) can collaborate in an autonomous way, on-­
site, in their respective work sphere on various society projects. This process takes 
place as part of “collaborative networks”. The goal of collaborative design is to 
allow stakeholders to work in a more efficient way by producing collaborative 
actions beyond cultural, disciplinary, geographic and temporal barriers. However, 
for the system to work, we have to configure it in a way it meets the needs of social 
demands and changes. Researches on collaboration have met many opposition 
caused by traditional sciences determinist followers also resulting from some mis-
understanding caused by previous works lacking precision. This chapter proposes 
the first draft of the community informatics design ecosystem creation and suggests 
several types of appropriate architectures. It also provides a methodological frame-
work, even multi-methodological (Mingers and Brocklesby 1997), as a diverse vir-
tual co-design environment support. In other words, we attempt to test the design of 
community information systems (or to present a generic architecture for collabora-
tion software, the “the design for open collaboration”). The SADC of socio-­technical 
systems is essentially a frame and a platform framework offering design modalities 
adjustable to users’ needs. It is the starting point for organizations and virtual com-
munities that wish to implement new collaboration solutions. As an adjustable 
socio-collaborative platform, the SADC covers both community informatics design 
scientific basis and socio-technical aspects of collaboration design. It connects both 
to facilitate the information flow, the access to knowledge and users’ communities

28
coming together. The SADC also wants, to a lesser extent, to serve as a reference 
model, a conceptual framework, allowing to define a common ground and 
­terminology for communication studies. It is intended as an open-service platform 
prototype, expandable and adaptable for the structuring and integration of all sorts 
of online activity systems, socio-technical systems and personalized portals and 
even all sorts of collaboration platforms like virtual communities or virtual enter-
prise campus.
The SADC also contains a series of models offering a complete definition of the 
whole desirable characteristics of a collaborative work environment: a governance 
architecture accompanied by general architecture principles and collaboration 
design strategies like resource sharing and service group financing. This presumes 
an ethical framework containing rules of conduct, commitment, responsibilities and 
code of ethics. Therefore, we attempt to extract the first norms of the fields:
•	 A Social Architecture, provided with collaboration services norms, as well as a 
collaboration model that underlies organizational aspects of collaboration aim-
ing at supporting new socio-technical or community informatics in their virtual 
environment design activities
•	 Community Information Architecture Systems that defines a logical framework 
for collaboration software deployment showing how different implementation 
projects cover various aspects of digital social systems design thinking and that 
clarifies interfaces with components like work spaces and Web services
•	 A Technical Architecture that connects information system components to the 
applicative underlying framework reflected in standard reference models for the 
SADC design
•	 A Production Architecture identifying formal or semiformal of collaboratories 
and their use by various application components
In other terms, it is about suggesting a new methodological orientation aiming to 
help designers of these new virtual environments (digital social systems) discover 
products, applications and functionalities and design help devices that meet their 
needs. We also want to indicate how the methodological configuration presented in 
the second part of the book can be applied to create reference architectures towards 
the co-building of virtual communities taken in a constant evolution environment, 
for the purpose of collaboration activities, problem-solving as well as all sorts of 
online human activity systems like governance of virtual communities dedicated to 
open innovation.
The second part of the book is entitled: “From modeling to implementation: the 
reference framework, the instantiation methodology and the strategic alignment and 
discovery matrix”. In Chaps. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, we present a digital social systems 
building guide (virtual communities, practice or innovation communities) that con-
tains several reference models, which are translated by a series of guidelines and 
support measures for processes and activities involved in the co-design (large-scale 
collaborative design also called “community informatics design”) of these new vir-
tual environments. The community informatics design guide (the SADC to be 
implemented) is a design management system, a governance model catalysed by an 
1  Global Transformation and Design Principles in the Knowledge Society

29
iterative cycle of seven flexible phases called “design space”. It is intended to pro-
vide creators of various types of virtual social systems, to virtual environment 
design experts, a better understanding of development needs and conditions as well 
as a series of mechanisms, functionalities and creativity tools to manage and 
operationalize in a semiformal way their entire life cycle and diverse actors’ and 
partners’ roles.
In Chap. 6, we describe digital social systems that can develop within several 
economic fields aiming to transform the physical vision of organization creation 
and traditional social systems (architecture co-building of “well-defined borders 
buildings”, linear process of enterprise value chain, universities or government 
institutions) in a structure represented by a multiform and multifunction network, in 
order to increase the actors’ chances to get involved in the “collaborative activities”. 
The new virtual environments co-design to help digital social system design (like 
the SADC as a virtual help environment for the creation of services portal or innova-
tion communities) systematically uses network infrastructures and socio-digital 
media. We believe community informatics design will considerably grow in the next 
years because the notion of “participative social architecture” PSA we are develop-
ing in the present book adds a “sense of place (following Joshua Meyrowitz) and 
moment” as well as an added value to the traditional physical space and social time 
notions where human activities used to take place. The Web 3.0 digital social sys-
tems (DSS) are emerging through collaboration mechanisms in place in the social 
Web structure (LinkedIn, Facebook, Moodle) that must be understood as new spaces 
built in the service collaborative social architectures. In fact, digital social systems 
apply common networking infrastructures and ICT with the objective of freeing 
itself from the restrictive barriers of geographical and territorial determinism, with-
out missing the tangible character in human or inter-organizational relations. 
However, the infrastructure aspect (technologies, software, platforms) does not 
affect the structure work of the community informatics expert in developing col-
laborative spaces. Besides, we insist on the fact that mediatized computer collabora-
tion and communication contain more complex and abstract processes related to 
belonging, identity, trust, cohesion, resource mutualization, governance and ethics.
In Chap. 7, we affirm the necessity of making an openness effort by observing 
the language of compartmentalized disciplines that must make their specialized 
boundaries explode (a reference to Henri Laborit in his “new chart”) to transcend 
boundaries and zones of uncertainty regarding the unique linguistics of each field. 
Whether it is psychology focusing on cognitive aspects, sociology for social action-­
related aspects, communication for interaction and collaboration, economy for 
aspects related to operating costs and development budgets, operational research 
studies on risks and performance and aesthetics for issues related to interface har-
mony, balance or beauty, or even the systems governance, we must be attentive to 
these dialogues if we want to develop common visions and actions and avoid to 
succumb to a never-ending solipsism. These multiple aspects, examined several 
times throughout the book, must be described and harmonized in the design and 
implementation of systems centred on the human being. The contribution of several 
is a crucial condition of the essential social systems dimension description and sev-

eral subsystems of activities that evolve interacting through discourses, languages, 
artefacts and methods. We will see a first attempt at this type of effort in the 
­transdisciplinary dimension definition effort that community informatics design 
suggests and in the articulation of these dimensions as a “fundamental verification 
list” that constitutes the hearth of our instantiation strategy.
We will see that we can carve the diverse aspects of the digital social systems’ 
world into many “shared meaning worlds” that intervene in the community informat-
ics systems design. To do so, we have developed an original tool, the “community 
informatics instantiation methodology”, with the main objective to support the com-
munity informatics design process by the meticulous deconstruction of its multiple 
aspects, as meaning or shared activities spheres, whether it is management mecha-
nisms, design models or process, architectures, methodologies and resources allowing 
to operationalize the community informatics reference model in its different virtual 
and real application environments. The development of an instantiation methodology 
represents a great challenge for a small team of researchers like the ACILs. This activ-
ity, which is not very present nor validated in social sciences but exists in some fields 
like marketing, the action research or management, requires a combination of a vari-
ety of models developed by a large number of authors from various fields.
Chapter 8 reminds the challenge software engineers, technology managers and 
ICT users/designers will have to face, in considering technological platforms, social 
media and collaborative technologies as being part of larger systems containing not 
only technical aspects but also social and human aspects. Current conceptual mod-
els, originating from software engineering systems as well as social sciences 
(human-computer interaction (HCI), computer support cooperative system (CSCW), 
communication mediatized by computers (CMC), Scandinavian participative 
design, interactive design, digital design, media design and more recently 
technology-­mediated social participation (TMSP)) are limited in their perspectives, 
more particularly in their ability to represent information and virtual complex sys-
tems’ architectures. This chapter presents a conceptual structure and a modeling 
framework that aims to improve existing socio-technical system design architec-
tures. By coming back to the social architecture notion, we suggest an analysis and 
design framework that allows to optimize jointly, to operationalize and instantiate 
the architectures defined in the previous chapters (technological, organizational, 
informational, participative, collaborative architectures, etc.) for digital social sys-
tems design as human activity systems mediatized by ICT (social media, collabora-
tive platforms, creativity and design tools).
The value of our theoretical and practical effort will be to allow digital humani-
ties, computational social sciences and digital communication practitioners to have 
for the first time tools and means to visually design and arrange the social and col-
laborative structure of their online activity systems, while allowing engineers, man-
agers and computer programmers to widen their respective field view in order to 
structure various types of conversations and languages to facilitate socio-technical 
systems design like digital social systems. This chapter represents a way to increase 
existing documentation by suggesting a clear and concise generic structure for the 
construction of human activity systems on the Internet, like healthcare digital social

systems, learning communities in education, enterprises-virtual campuses and 
­universities and intervention and cultural strategies. It does not require any particular 
formal computer programming or code language expertise. Based on discovery 
matrices, the morphological analysis technique (Godet), the heuristics questioning 
matrix in imaginative and creative thinking (Moles 1992), as well as multi-field and 
multi-aspect matrices (BASDEN), our approach aims to provide social sciences 
researchers with a qualitative and quantitative methodology that will be used by 
communication students and citizens/designers to identify, name and organize com-
munity information systems in a way to better capture, memorize, treat, analyse and 
design complex data related to community informatics information systems that 
will evolve according to a socio-communicational character growing stronger in the 
near future.
Chapter 9 is strongly anchored in the practices’ orientation. From the framework 
detailed in the previous chapters and the set of entities defined as modalities, mean-
ing spheres or aspects to take into consideration in a DSS instantiation/implementa
tion, we present in this chapter the definition of the multi-aspectual and multimodal 
discovery and strategic alignment matrix (2MDSAM) for digital social systems 
design. The 2MDSAM provides an operational reference framework to organize 
and model the DSS interactive elements and dynamic components, as well as a way 
to describe the design process and activities. Its objective is to close the gaps of cur-
rent modeling systems with the input of various disciplines and fields related to 
modeling virtual social systems. The evolution of the Web over the last 10 years had 
us to form information and communication systems design dedicated to content 
production and organization (websites) to support digital social systems for action 
and transformations at the community, family, organization and social life level at 
different scales and from different worldviews. This is a new social creativity situa-
tion put at the service of change. Social sciences have remained very quiet until now 
in front of this major phenomenon of the beginning of the third millennium. In this 
chapter, and in the spirit to contribute to the challenges posed by the so-called 
Fourth Industrial revolution, we seek to fill this gap by suggesting a concrete repre-
sentation and modeling tool while showing the potential of universal design centred 
on the human being. The 2MDSAM operationalize the DSS conceptualization (its 
instantiation) while taking up the challenge of addressing the limits of design frame-
works existing in the organizations and digital social systems design. It provides a 
way to organize information on various modalities and numerous aspects of digital 
social systems, in order to facilitate co-creation and cognition distributed for a bet-
ter DSS development.
In Chap. 10, we continue the community informatics design operating descrip-
tion, by following the life cycle of the seven design spaces that allow, by iteration, 
to identify the entities and elements to model and instantiate in the SADC. We can 
define the SADC as an innovation network with open-source code or user network 
support, where online community managers obtain DSS design helping tools. In the 
long run, it will become a platform that will promote strategic alliances between 
organizations wanting to offer multimodal conditions (human, financials, social, 
infrastructural and organizational) to support the rapid and fluid configuration of 
1.5  The Detailed Presentation of the Book’s Chapters

32
collaborative platforms useful to organizations, large and complex stakeholders’ 
network and society.
Thus, the SADC that will be implanted online in the next years to come can be 
defined, according to the ACIL works (UQAM) as a “socially responsible commu-
nication design platform combining physical and virtual spaces” that mainly focuses 
on the creation of support environment that can guide various types of participative 
design appropriate to the establishment of a good governance, creativity tool appro-
priation, a continuous cooperation and an optimal collaboration through different 
means of technological supports helping users in the creation of their own efficient 
and effective collaboration environment adapted to their different online practices.
However, we must keep in mind that DSS are often coalitions and short-term 
organization dynamics less well adapted to a maturation and collective environment 
(reunification, incubation or learning environment) to answer to a collaboration 
opportunity between designers and users of a virtual environment while integrating 
skills or basic skills and necessary resources to reach, even go beyond the quality 
frameworks, delays and costs expected by recipient users whose cooperation is sup-
ported by computer networks (Camarinha-Matos and Afsarmanesh 2007). However, 
once it is successful, the DSS can extend its lifespan over many years.
So, this chapter suggests a tool framework (a verification list as the science first 
stage that will evolve over the years) made of a socially responsible design (com-
munity informatics design), a reference model, a management framework and an 
instantiation methodology, as a set of guidelines providing means to support the 
process and activities involved in the creation and operations of new virtual environ-
ments. The community informatics design kit (the SADC) aims to provide design 
initiators and managers with the understanding of the demands as well as foresight 
mechanism regarding the functionalities management while co-building virtual 
environments and DSS. With this tenth chapter, we close the iterative cycle allowing 
the SADC to offer all resources to support the DSS creation, while remaining an 
essential tool to update the third-phase science that is community informatics design 
science.
Our conclusion is not a real one, because it is dedicated to the description of a 
future research program. The ubiquitous imagination in a complex design world is 
only in its early stage. The concrete FOSM contribution to community informatics 
design, of its seven iterative design spaces and 2MDSAM in the apprehension and 
implementation of digital social systems, still remains to be developed. We will 
need several important socio-technical projects to validate its foundations, theories, 
methodologies and its applications. Even if we believe the conceptual scaffolding, 
the reference framework and instantiation strategies presented in this book are suf-
ficient to describe several complex social systems that are interesting for our soci-
ety. To produce its modeling and design, we still do not know yet to what extent the 
seven design spaces and the seven preferred modeling fields represent an appropri-
ate design methodology for the DSS development. We do not know their future vali-
dation effect on our society either. We simply call for more and more studies and the 
creation of dynamic research programs in the future.

Chapter 2
Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase 
Science
In this chapter, we outline an exploratory research on the configuration of scientific 
knowledge and practices of digital social systems’ design in the context of innova-
tion by co-design on the Internet. In order to guide this exploration through the 
jungle of fields, concepts, theories, methodologies and applications, our team 
mainly resorted to a text not well known by communication experts and social sci-
ence practitioners but, according to us, that is fundamental for the understanding of 
the foundation of any scientific field, The Domain of Science Model, presented in 
1986 by John Nelson Warfield, and that inspired many important researchers in the 
field of social systems design.
Warfield is committed to the creation of a generic design science (1994) likely to 
integrate the management and collaborative design of large-scale systems like the 
ones we find in inter-enterprises collaborative networks or scientific practice com-
munities transbordering the Internet. Warfield (1986) feels that, for better or for 
worse, our societies have accepted the idea of complex systems at a large scale. If 
we want to step up to the challenge of guiding them socially and ethically, we need 
to acquire the necessary skills to manage and coordinate them. An excellent way to 
do so is to learn to design them. In the present chapter and all through this book, we 
will examine the foundations of a community informatics design’s generic science 
that relies on this idea of great complex systems with the angle of several fields such 
as the design of socio-technical systems and social systems design as the base of 
construction of digital social systems. The “collaborative network co-design”(our 
generic designation for collaborative design, interactive design, participative design, 
design centred around the user and the design centred around the human) currently 
presents great difficulties of modeling and integration of human factors and tech-
nologies that overcome designers’ skills while threatening them to quickly lose the 
cognitive and practical systems control they help developing. The implementation 
of a community informatics design generic science as an applied science of great 
socio-technical systems currently born on the Internet is founded on the most impor-
tant elements of universal knowledge gathered in several fields of design for decades 

36
by the best practitioners and becomes one of the conditions for the deployment of 
sustainable development designs of humanity.
Warfield’s entire works can help us to build the bases of a community informat-
ics design’s generic and transdisciplinary science and to articulate it in a clear and 
simple way through multiple ramifications of a complex systems science. In his 
publications, Warfield explores the science basis according to the pragmatic attitude 
of the great philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce. By doing so, he integrates dimen-
sions that are usually missing from the science philosophy and articulate them logi-
cally in a “science theory”. Indirectly, his effort shows us that his science notion is 
more appropriate than traditional representations.
Warfield defines simultaneously the roles of formal language objects and the 
ones from natural metalanguages. As we will see, this opens up the door to transdis-
ciplinary collaboration, for example, between computing and social and communi-
cation science practitioners. In this regard, Warfield develops important qualitative 
reality relational descriptions and incorporates them in mathematics digital dimen-
sions. We will see in Chap. 4 that this attitude is salutary for researchers that wish to 
integrate precision in their analysis of complex social phenomena, even if they do 
not possess the theoretical and practical baggage of quantification specific to pure 
science and different engineer sciences. Therefore, Warfield integrates these quali-
tative mathematics to universal antecedents to create a “generic design science”.
The Peirce philosophy that influences Warfield in the first instance incorporates 
the topic knowing the knowledge definition. Warfield examines the retroactive loops 
between the object, the concept and the subject and not only between the object and 
the concept or between the subject and the object. He invites us to an exhaustive 
conception of science. This conception is interested first by empty locations and 
spaces left by the conventional Cartesian science, at the origin of a permanent sepa-
ration between the objective worlds, “what is there in the reality”, and the subjective 
world of “cognitive universes” that perceives and explores them. Warfield decom-
partmentalizes the observer and the objective world by integrating the notion of 
knowledgeable subject. He does not make the counterfactual distinction with a “dis-
embodied cosmic observer” that could adjudicate ex cathedra regarding the objec-
tivity of a fact, truth or falseness.
In this tradition, Warfield was one of the pioneers in the design of social system 
in proposing questions raised by ontology, epistemology and communication con-
nections between foundations of a science, theory, methodology, applications and 
project governance. He speaks expressly of the “knowledgeable subject” observer 
in the production of realities as well as the psychosocial nature of human participa-
tion at all stages of activities and design process. In this sense, Warfield can help us 
participate in the ongoing construction of the “third phase” of science. The works of 
Kenneth Bausch (Bausch and Flanagan 2012; Flanagan and Bausch 2011) and of 
Thomas R. Flanagan (Flanagan et al. 2012), inspired by Gérard de Zeeuw (1997), 
the design’s semantics turn (Krippendorff 2007) and the entire current movement of 
conversational and dialogue in design that includes the interactive movement, the 
science of dialogic design and the language/action perspective represent a way to 
establish the ­third-­phase science as a means to understand and adapt complex social 
systems. First, let us see the previous phases.
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

37
Very schematically, let us say that de Zeeuw (1997) maintains that in the first 
phase of science, there is no separation between the observer and the object. 
However, the connections are often so thin that the separation postulate is often 
justified and still produce valid results. In this first phase, this detachment of the 
observer and its subject is specially applied to physics and biology. Still according 
to de Zeeuw, in the second phase of science, the acknowledgment of an object 
depends on the point of view of the observer. This second phase is required in quan-
tum physics, in medicine and more particularly in psychology and social sciences. 
The objects in the second phase of science are defined as grouping of defined quali-
ties in terms of standard deviations with respect to a statistical median. The social 
science researchers are facing important problems when they research constant evo-
lution systems in this second phase. Argyris (1993a, b) reminds us that during this 
period, researchers are facing a problem lying in the fact that they do not consider 
the influence of the subject on its observation object; it is a problem that can con-
taminate the entire research project. The independent observation of an informed 
observer, according to Merton, apprehends the world through the glasses of an indi-
vidual observer. In the first phase, this lens is polished, and its angle is sharp to 
allow several researchers to see an object in a more precise way. In this phase, a 
non-material observer and the material world are understood in terms of essences, 
meaning it corresponds to the natural tendency the human has of distinguishing 
what constitutes the exterior world, its own nature (observation of exterior things) 
and its being, the true nature of the cognitive subject watching it.
Broadly, these hypotheses do not pose any problem for science routines in the 
fields of physics, chemistry and biology. They can, however, cause dismay when, in 
a thorough researcher, we discover that the “opposite of a deep truth is a deep equal 
truth” (Neils Bohr, quoted by Bausch and Flanagan 2013). In subatomic physics, a 
researcher can discover a particle if he observes a certain way, whereas another one 
can discover an undulation if he looks at it differently.
In the paradigm of dissociation of the observer and its object, we also use the lens 
of only one observer, but we recognize the observer and its object are part of the 
same reality level. The second-phase science continues to see reality through only 
one pair of glasses while making sure to provide only one abstract definition of its 
object, while understanding, however, that its definitions are built by the observer. 
Reality does not read like a text. During this phase, scientists suggest the hypothesis 
of a plurality of individual observers with their individual glasses to understand the 
world and its objects. The granted efforts to precise the orientation of any type of 
glasses or vision angle and to create consensual definitions can lead to vision con-
flicts regarding the “pair of glasses” we are using to look at the world as well as 
disagreements on the nature of the study’s object. These disagreements can in some 
cases be contained or “made up” by a group of relatively homogenous researchers 
who have a common research program and who, eventually, resort to statistics 
methods to describe social or cultural situations. However, these disagreements can 
become very important when heterogeneous researcher groups with varied pro-
grams try to describe the social and cultural worlds. These difficulties associated 
with the “World Vision” and the view angles can become insurmountable if experts 
try to resolve problems or intervene in the organizational, social or cultural change.
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

38
De Zeeuw (1996, 1997) shows that, for several years, a third phase of science 
suggests another way of building the object with the dialogue and conversation 
between interdependent observers. As the observers share their perspectives (World 
Vision, object definition, prescribed roles in the research, transdisciplinary dia-
logue), they build a common context that constitutes the object of their delibera-
tions. It is the third-phase method used by researchers like Warfield (1994, 1999), 
Gibbons (1994), and Nicolescu (1996). This method promotes the visions borrowed 
from various types of “glasses” and vision angles in order to use in the co-building 
of “combination lenses” that are shared by an epistemic community while it matures 
the concept sharing to examine the object at the heart of its researches. Through this 
meta-glance, a community of practitioners from various disciplines is gaining a 
common understanding of a situation in which practitioners are collectively sub-
merged to make decisions on the way to study it or intervene. We are not far from 
defining transdisciplinarity here. In a very recent collective work, Transdisciplinarity: 
Bridging Natural Science, Social Science, Humanities and Engineering, published 
in memory of John Warfield in 2011 with contributions from authors like Basarab 
Nicolescu, we can find the following definition of transdisciplinarity:
With respect to what is between disciplines, through disciplines and beyond all disciplines. 
Its objective is to understand the present world, in which imperatives affect the knowledge 
unity. (Nicolescu 2011, p. 26)
Thus the third-phase science adopts the deep principles of transdisciplinarity by 
searching and by respecting the reference frameworks in order to perform observa-
tions from multiple points of view and observers to better understand the object 
inclusive context. The specialized language or languages that help determine the 
“discussion object” are established through the interaction of involved observers. 
The third-phase science specifically negotiates the modalities of behaviours and 
social change, such as self-organization of group activities by social action and 
intentional social change. The third-phase science as such does not try to give the 
researcher additional control over the human dimensions. It does not manipulate its 
users nor does it try to antagonize participants’ attitude. According to de Zeeuw 
(1997), it allows everyone to answer the people and communities’ request that act 
as interactive users in a given situation (e.g. a diagnostic on a social design situa-
tion). It allows them to learn collectively, socially and systematically and to develop 
required resources to improve their own development. This common task, this 
socio-construction of the object and worlds to build, is not a task we can perform 
appropriately with a desk review, as exhaustive it may be.
The generic design science favoured by Warfield falls into line well with social 
systems design initiated by Churchman (1971, 1974) and by Checkland and Banathy 
(1996, 2000, 2005), as well as with different dialogic modes that come with it 
(Christakis and Bausch 2006; Christakis 2005; Christakis and Harris 2004; Judge 
1995, 2007, 2008a; Jenlink 2004, 2006, 2009; Jenlink and Banathy 2008; Laszlo 
et al. 2010; Laszlo and Laszlo 2007, 2004). These systemic conception approaches 
(Simon 1996, 1974, 1969, 1960) show us several ways to ensure the co-building and 
the co-design of complex socio-communication issues according to various points 
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

39
of view. This science, much more philosophically articulated than contemporary 
definition of design thinking, is built on the basis of an inclusive attitude, a design 
culture that suggests a descriptive and normative language and that is in line with 
different design situations and social change. It stipulates the necessary stages and 
phases to develop multimodal and multi-aspectual objects that are the subject of this 
present book. These analysis, synthesis, design, intervention and implantation pro-
cesses include not only system users but all the stakeholders that rely on their own 
language and not only expert languages belonging to pure sciences, to their “laws” 
and to their “objective facts”. How? Let us come back to Warfield’s works.
In the generic design science, it is important to look in a critical way at ontology, 
epistemology, methodology and communication questions. If these ideas that we 
defend in our methodology classes for years were meticulously applied in the infor-
mation and communications sciences, as well as in social and human sciences, they 
would contribute to alleviate a deep misunderstanding and to increase the capacity 
of reflection according to models and their foundations. A meticulous application 
and more generalized of these sciences shows that it is not necessary to quantify 
social and communication sciences to make them rigorous, nor to quantify the con-
struction of information systems such as social media, collaborative platforms, ser-
vice portals or enterprise intranets, for them to exist or to implant new systems. 
Rather, like Warfield says, even if the “scientific approach” requires precision, it 
does not necessarily require quantification. This fact is of major importance for the 
practice of several social and human sciences that have tried to emulate observation 
modes of the first phases of science, with substantial epistemological gaps, and that 
now can define and position an object in an analysis and non-mathematical reason-
ing space, not to mention that social science researchers never really possessed the 
necessary mathematical basis to elaborate quantifiable issues. Initially, this seems to 
be an unsurmountable epistemological barrier in the first and second phases of sci-
ences. It is not the case in the third phase where even if the quantification force 
remains appropriate in various situations, the transdisciplinary work can fill the 
gaps through several skills that articulate hard science and soft science in a new 
way.
As a matter of fact, social and communication sciences deprive themselves of a 
space notion used in hard sciences, except for some researchers like Abraham 
Moles, who knew how to show the benefits in Psychosociologie de l’espace (Moles 
and Rohmer 1998). They were restrained by the convention according to which the 
space notion should be quantifiable (mathematically). Because sciences face the 
realities that are rarely quantifiable in their fundamental characteristics, they were 
deprived of the obvious idea of organizing power of “space concept”. The notion of 
space contains a usage generality that goes beyond the idea of dimensions. Warfield 
(1986) tells us it defines a series of relations in reference to an imagined space that 
integrates them. A (reasoning) space includes all the components of a field (e.g. 
actors’ roles, functionalities of technologies in use, characteristic and properties of 
a socio-technical system). The space is a universal relation that contains all the 
­possible relations between entities or elements found in it. In this space, it is not 
necessary for relations between elements to be quantifiable for them to provide 
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

40
explicit arrangement between those elements. These short definitions’ conclusion is 
that in social and communication sciences, the series of aspects, dimensions and 
elements of a field, their relations and their interactions do not require quantifiable 
elements to be apprehended in their complexity.
Warfield and Christakis (1987) demonstrate, for example, that quantification of 
the dimension concept is not a necessary condition for its use. For 25 years, we have 
taught students that the dimension concept, introduced in social sciences by 
researchers like Katz and Lazarsfeld (2006), Lazarsfeld and Merton (1971), Moles 
(1990) and Moles and Jacobus (1988), constitutes one of the major contributions to 
pure and social sciences. The conceptual analysis and the decomposition of con-
cepts in variables, states, attributes, factors and indicators have shown the prodi-
gious impact of what is called the operationalization of concepts in social 
communication research (conceptual analysis and articulations). By decomposing 
concepts in quantitative dimensions (e.g. socio-demographic characteristics) and in 
qualitative dimensions (the relation between social appropriation of technologies 
and quality of life), we give ourselves the concrete possibility to discuss systematic 
relations between concepts or components of a socio-technical system without hav-
ing to resort to mathematics. This definition of dimensionality in a qualitative rea-
soning space transcends classic reductionist interpretations of the space notion. It 
allows us to expand the use of space and qualitative dimensions to much broader 
classes of situations. We will see, in different chapters dedicated to methodology, 
that these concepts allowed us to adopt a pluri-methodological attitude (mixed 
methods) and that the entire instantiation strategy of community informatics design 
of organizations and digital social systems can greatly benefit from discovery matrix 
methodology. We will also see that the dimension creation process, like in the field 
of alignment between collaborative tools and the needs of a community, can later be 
computerized and then used in complex socio-technical modeling systems on a 
large scale. Dimension lists and elements to factor in can be done by researchers in 
social sciences and their students. These participants can answer important ques-
tions on dimension contents, document them and classify them (e.g. the role of vari-
ous stakeholders of an innovation project and relations with other fields, especially 
collaborative tools they wish to appropriate). Once the dimensions and fields are 
taken in inventory by these members who are not computer specialist nor mathema-
ticians, computing experts can then transform (translate) them in programming 
algorithms and solutions in a way to organize them in more customized modeling 
and visualization tools, the way to facilitate the understanding of diverse evolutive 
properties of a complex social system.
The important thing to know here, for the establishment for conceptual and 
methodological basis of community informatics design, is that a dimension is a 
technical term that refers to the “natural and specialized language” of social and 
communication sciences and their qualitative aspects. As we will see in the com-
munity informatics design instantiation strategy where we have to fulfil tasks of 
establishing and arranging the various components related to the major fields to 
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

41
model and understand (roles, functionalities, socio-technologies), the notions of 
space and dimensions can help determine relations between the characteristics of a 
practice community. “A is in the same category as B”, “A is influenced by B”, “A 
and B are in a reciprocal interdependence”, “A is in conflict with B”, “A must pre-
cede B temporally”, etc.
In this spirit of theoretical imagination (Weick 1995; Weick et al. 2005) aiming 
the qualitative representation of various design fields through the relations reason-
ing, Warfield distinguishes four universal antecedents of a design science: the 
human being, the language, the reasoning by relations and the modes of archival 
representations. By developing these concepts and linking them to each other, he 
provides the essential concept that fills the gaps of several sciences, like applied 
information systems and communication sciences as well as the major socio-­
technical systems sciences developed in collaborative networks on the Internet. 
Warfield connects these antecedents to the “cosmic partition” of Pierce: Library, 
Phaneron, and Residue. He manages to suggest an essential basis to “design sci-
ences” that must be composed with numerous aspects of social systems, such as the 
one we propose in defining the “digital social systems design” field we build 
throughout this book. Therefore, according to this scientific approach, we must 
“observe”, “infer”, “establish” and “archive”.
The Cosmic Partition Library is the integration of all the information contained 
in human media. The Phaneron is the entirety of ideas that exist in the spirit of 
people. The Residue represents the rest of the universe after we have subtracted the 
elements contained in the Library and the Phaneron. The science process consists of 
transforming the Residue elements in entities represented by the Library and the 
Phaneron, to recycle them and to examine their results in an evolutive way. The 
design science or “design sciences” juggle with the use and transformation that 
come from the Residue and the Phaneron, through various media in spectra of the-
ory, methodology, technology and management. Traditionally, according to disci-
plinary synthesis, we have performed for 5 or 6 years design deals with a context, a 
situation, objectives’ knowledge and intentions as well as a design process (see 
Chap. 4). With the current digital (computational) media explosion and the prolif-
eration of data bases in all human life sectors coupled with design activities of large-­
scale systems and transborder sociocultural community systems, we must take into 
account at least six other dimensions. They are (1) behavioural norms, (2) exem-
plary practices and lessons learned when systems fail, (3) learning related to human 
limitations in the mastery of complexity, (4) knowledge about design intentions of 
several stakeholders, (5) the design process and (6) the context. The entire aim of 
our theoretical and practical effort resides in the possible deeper realization of these 
dimensions whose prioritization in our architecture and our infrastructures will 
allow to avoid certain disasters related to badly defined issues and to eliminate 
obstacles considered unavoidable until now.
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

42
2.1  The Human Being
The first universal antecedent is the human being. Because human participation is 
omnipresent in knowledge and community informatics design’s management, the 
nature of the participation should be explicit to all stages of science under construc-
tion: in its foundations, its hypothesis, its theories, the selection of criteria of con-
struction and evaluation, methodology, roles and environments. To do so, the 
relevant and appropriate information to each design context must come from social 
and communication sciences as well as philosophy.
The researches we are leading for several years show us people approach com-
munities’ behaviour according to two orientations: activities and emotions. In non-­
organized groups and communities, the behaviour is relevantly organized with the 
following verbs: brainstorm, regulate and perform tasks that, even if interesting, 
cannot, on their own, totally ensure the activities to accomplish. Often, practice 
communities realize the simulated consensus that social psychologists have named 
“groupthink”, through which members of a work group or a practice community 
take decisions without having access to substantial information. Generally, all 
groups experience problems, whether with communication, evaluation, control, 
decision-making, tensions management, transactional equity, consolidation or lead-
ership maturation. As John Warfield reminds us, “the incredible is normal, the 
bizarre is the social norm, and what we could reasonably expect from a society that 
adheres to a reasonable behavior is abnormal each time major systems are involved” 
(Warfield 1986, p. 51).
According to Warfield, the social groups’ strange behaviours originated in our 
digital worlds (in reference to cognition instead of cyberspace). A digital world is 
unattainable to those who possess it; in that sense it constitutes a sort of an unwaver-
ing cognitive overload (according to Pierce’s expression, quoted by Bausch 2001) 
that the individual carries with him through his life experiences. It is as if in this 
digital world of each individual, there could be value components (of World Vision) 
specific to any design situation that can involve the person in a way or another. Also, 
each individual carries with him, in the same container, components that represent 
the digital world and that can be damaging to the same design situation. This is why, 
beyond the perceptual prisms related to expertise coupled with the digital world’s 
phenomenon, it is important to have members that represent a wide array of disci-
plines, knowledge, disposition, interests, general attitudes towards the world, skills, 
operational capacities, etc.
Another very important dimension for the understanding of complex design situ-
ations is our poor capacity to develop deep logical patterns. This poor aptitude is an 
aspect highlighted by one of the conception sciences founders, Herbert Simon 
(1969, 1960, and 1974). It is defined by “a rationality limited to master the complex-
ity” or is translated by our incapacity to understand a complex project or design 
situation in all its interrelations. In Chap. 8, we present the discovery matrix method 
that allows to reduce complex situations in their more significant components for a 
project’s stakeholders. The key aspect to take into consideration is our human 
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

43
incompetence to retain more than height items in our short-term memory. In other 
words, we cannot reason appropriately and simultaneously about interactions 
between more than a small number of dimensions and factors. For this reason, 
online social systems like “blockchain”, cyber-physical social systems, enterprise 
portals, communities of practice and living labs must be modularized in order to 
deal with this cognitive limitation of real and virtual communities in the apprehen-
sion of design structures and process. Our team has defined a large number of design 
concepts (design context, socio-technologies, design process) and has reduced them 
to a few definitions judged essential to the decision-making for large complex sys-
tems design. These large dimensions represent essential fields to model, for exam-
ple, in the tasks consisting of aligning design and modeling tools with design 
activities to be accomplished in order to build digital social systems containing very 
large and numerous dimensions. In practice, each dimension or module related to 
the problem contains more than three interactive elements. These three elements 
each contain four combinations, which gives a total of seven elements and 
combinations.
2.2  Language and Dialogue Modes
The second universal antecedent is language. We use various languages in our 
everyday life. There are also language experts like computer experts and specialized 
discipline languages that facilitate the operations’ synergy between humans and 
software tools. We call “object languages” the ones specifically dedicated to com-
puting. The aspect languages are the transdisciplinary languages used for various 
aspects of the world (cognitive, social and cultural) and that help the transdisci-
plinary configuration of all dimensions retained by a community to build its DSS 
and its virtual community. Thus, community informatics design programming 
becomes the configuration of technological modules of a DSS through languages 
oriented towards the aspects. For example, aesthetics, ethics and cognitive ergo-
nomics aspects refer to world visions and practices containing their own languages. 
It is why we must build metalanguages to speak of these local specialized lan-
guages. The object languages cannot provide their own metalanguages to speak 
about it, says Godel. Therefore, we must combine object languages, computing 
expert languages with the natural language that serves as metalanguage. This does 
not mean that we should use the common language. All our efforts over the past 
4 years have been on language use, field ontologies and glossaries in order to pre-
cise the theorization field and community informatics design application. In fact, we 
should be aware that a good science and a good design created in transdisciplinary 
collaboration require meticulous language objects, explained and negotiated by 
communication and natural language. The great theoretical physicist David Bohm 
(1965, 1996), Professor Emeritus at the University of London, well known for his

system that has the potential to bring new world visions. Anthony Judge (1995, 
2007, and 2008a) has dedicated a major part of his life to study the way different 
dialogue modes could contribute to establish peace in the world and the way to 
participate in these modes. His works show it is more and more necessary to build 
common world visions while better mastering, cognitively and socially, the great 
issues related to sustainable development and global governance supported by tech-
nology. It is also important to be able to present its colleagues with motivating 
projects. This is done through speech and language. While keeping in mind the huge 
roles that cultural facilitation and social media platform design play in globaliza-
tion, we must remember that social and public communication sciences will be up 
front in the co-building of new collaborative governance modes in the next few 
years. We will come back to it in the following chapters.
For now, suffice it to say that in addition to the oral and written prose language, 
we possess other types of basic languages that are necessary to community infor-
matics design: mathematics, diagrammatic and animation and linear prose in its 
emission and its reception. It is necessary to organize our thoughts but often defi-
cient in suggesting new forms in the world pedagogically. Animation presents sig-
nificant forms by combining the text and image. It can use all sorts of languages 
which require the understanding of generative grammar of the functional image 
(Moles 1990; Moles and Rohmer 1986, 1998): music, sounds, schematic videos, 
animated cartoons, drawings and symbols. Mathematics produce forms by condens-
ing formal language prose or signs of the natural language in programming algo-
rithms that translate representations and intentions of human design projects. An 
illustration of the possibility of using various languages in the programming of an 
e-learning network platform based on animation will be presented in Chap. 4 when 
we will describe in detail our CAPACITÉS design model and the communication 
star model.
The diagrammatic (graphic mode) that community informatics design uses in the 
discovery matrix (Chap. 8) presents a sort of descriptive landscape of the “commu-
nication action” in the design activities. These exploratory matrices in modeling and 
design try to reduce the complexity of design situations by calling upon the eye and 
the human visualization capacities to appreciate chosen implicit structural relations 
between social architecture platforms and design activities to accomplish. 
Considering our limited rationality in the individual and collective apprehension of 
complex social systems, the diagrammatic and graphic modes are usually widely 
used in our works, for example, in the present book, and are necessary to help peo-
ple and communities to understand the social systems and to mentally master differ-
ent complex network digital organizations. In the dawning science of “community 
informatics design”, design intentions call upon a combination of graphics and 
prose, but the production and configuration of social media and collaborative plat-
forms require the collaboration of analyst and systems integrators who master pro-
gramming, quantification and mathematics.
A good hybrid language like the “oriented towards aspects programming”, sug-
gested in Chap. 8, can combine computing object languages, a precise prose coming 
from social and communication sciences, well-scripted graphic and animation

­representations and can undoubtedly contribute to express systemic and complex 
organizational relations during the building of future digital social systems. All 
these specialized languages can be consolidated with the help of dialogue and natu-
ral language. A glossary and an enlightened use of various dialogue modes must be 
an integral part of any research program on human-computer interfaces (computer-­
assisted teamwork, computer-mediatized communication) aiming at making socio-­
technical design of large-scale systems possible. The methodology we will present 
in Chap. 7, the definition of concepts and the multi-aspect hybrid languages that we 
will suggest to describe the properties and attributes represent an important effort in 
that sense. These descriptive efforts aim to tackle the difficulties related to our lim-
ited rationality by looking to help us in the cognitive mastery of complex social 
systems by making the systems visually feasible and easily modeled by validating a 
“frame of reference transparency” (Warfield) in the rigorous description of com-
munity informatics design process (Chap. 9, section 9.2.6). The multi-aspect hybrid 
language produced to accompany community informatics design science is called 
“multimodal dialogue integrated system and multi-aspect languages”.
2.3  Reasoning Through Relations
The third universal antecedent is the reasoning through relations. This discovery 
related to the complexity of qualitative and quantitative results of our research is 
associated with the extension of analytic philosophy done by Warfield. We will see 
that this type of reasoning does not compel us to necessarily quantify design phe-
nomena and that they inspire the two chapters we dedicate to community informat-
ics design instantiation using discover matrices and strategic alignment of various 
design fields, their components and properties. Warfield (1986) examines the fol-
lowing analytical thematic: the types of inferences and their respective roles in rea-
soning, the types of logical patterns, the relations generation and certain structural 
metrics.
Pierce’s four kinds of inferences are the perceptual judgement, the abduction, the 
induction and the deduction. The perceptual judgement is an internal cognitive pro-
cess that interprets sensations to transform them in perception; it provides the larg-
est part of the individual virtual world. According to Pierce’s words, the abduction 
is the process through which our intuitions execute all sorts of theories, conjectures, 
hypotheses and explanations about the world. According to us, it is the fundamental 
process of new structure imagination, phenomena or events that do not exist in the 
world yet. We would say it is one of the great sources of human being creativity 
dealing with the imagination of the future’s social systems. It is a process that, after 
analysing new ideas related to phenomena, contributes to synthesize and pour them 
into the digital world. The induction interacts within the abduction to test new ideas 
on empiricism, experience and field observation basis. Deduction uses intuitive 
abduction elements as research hypothesis to produce a logical interference system 
through a formal or semiformal reasoning. By using interferences, a practice or

scientific community will extend towards doubt and reassessment as well as confir-
mation and belief.
The models of mathematics logic negotiate with relations patterns that exist 
within generic concepts explicitly defined. Qualitative logic negotiates relations 
patterns existing within “blurry or inaccurate” concepts we find in the methodology 
of an uncertain science that we are developing in the context of community infor-
matics design. Let us note that through this point of view that discriminates the 
exact and uncertain knowledge, we can ask ourselves if social and communication 
sciences would not be more advanced than exact sciences since they are precisely 
more able to concretely integrate the vague, the semiformal and the inaccurate prob-
lems related to the creation, design and applied sciences that are interested in vague 
issues. A real effort of deconstructing the topic in this book, first with a vast meth-
odology of digital social systems’ analysis and design and then with examples of 
sectorial methodologies with scientific creation in the everyday work of the 
researcher or designer (activity theory, technological, organizational and social 
architecture, conversational design, Leonardo’s case analysis, questionnaire, group 
discussion, dialogue), suggests, no more no less, a methodology of the creative 
spirit and massive sociological imagination in open innovation communities.
Contrary to the individual discovery process or the solitary genius invention, the 
“variation innovation” relies on combinations and alignments of logical relations 
and optional choices from design rules already known or elements defined by their 
properties and attributes: community informatics design’s methodologies can be 
used in the next years by transdisciplinary expert groups and uninitiated civil soci-
ety ones and by open innovation user groups. Even for data entry in a modeling 
software like a visualization tool, as long as the analysis of the architecture compo-
nents and the design process are known, which makes it a case of finding how to put 
collective artificial intelligence at the service of the community.
Therefore, logic helps us going around the limitations of the human memory. 
However, its success goes through the good specific operations’ conduct. When it is 
well handled, it can create structures of deep and profound logic extended to numer-
ous design fields described by a researcher or a team that allows to make the rela-
tions existing within a digital social system transparent.
Logic and mathematics are two exemplary types of transparent methodological 
structures. Mathematics has the precision that is universally accepted. However the 
“vague logic”, the one we use in the present community informatics design works, 
often deals with qualities and values that are not numerically quantifiable. For this 
reason, community informatics design is rigorously accompanied by a logic that 
relies on semantics, semiotic and pragmatic precision and the evaluative feedback 
of action.
The semantics precision (Krippendorff 2007) requires some definitions. This is 
why in 2017, we will provide the readers with the book a list of terms and glossary. 
It is only the beginning of our effort to describe structures and design processes. 
This task can be carried out in four different ways: “naming”, “extending”, “con-
ceptualizing” and “linking”. “Naming” is a simple operation we are all familiar 
with; it is the more elementary definition form. “Extending” consists of defining a

47
class mane in terms of examples within a class, for example, the classification of 
canine species include several dog races. “Conceptualizing” corresponds to the 
classic mode of definition that aims to define concepts according to properties (attri-
butes) that seem to be an integral part. This is what we will do in Chap. 7 by defining 
the different concepts belonging to various aspects whose properties we try to out-
line. To define a concept or a class by “relations”, we try to describe its relationships 
with other factors, whether it is operational, conceptual, antithetical, by inclusion or 
exclusion, by par hierarchical or systemic relations or by priority relations, between 
other examples. All these ways of proceeding leave a space for dialogue and discus-
sion. Thereafter, we can examine the environment, the context or the situation or 
even provide a conceptual map of the relational process that defines it. This process 
contains several stages.
To produce an appropriate relations’ cartography, we must define both the types 
of relations and their extension (analytical prolongation). In order to succeed, we 
must define both the terms “link” (relationship between concepts) and the “relation” 
(their nature). For example, there is a relationship between two concepts belonging 
to the same class. Warfield uses the term “link” to represent an interpretive concept 
from the everyday language like the ideas of “life world” languages of Habermas 
(1984, 1973), who expresses the relationships between two entities (elements hav-
ing each its components and properties). The term “relation” is not exclusively 
reserved to more formal concepts like mathematics ones. Interrelations and associa-
tions between those two concepts are rarely taken into account. We can only pre-
sume that logic relations model relationships. In the community informatics design 
of complex social systems, each conceptual association, logical basis and the 
implicit mission must be considered collectively and openly to overcome local sub-
jectivities and lean towards a referential framework that is satisfying for a given 
practice community.
Warfield distinguishes six major categories of interpretive relationships we 
should consider in our analysis of context and DSS design process: the definitive 
link, the comparative link, the influential link, the temporal link, the spatial link and 
the mathematical link. In a definitive link, the entity A is a component of B; this link 
is expressed in terms of “included”, “imply”, “contain” or “is in the same category 
as”. A comparative link evaluates relations between entities A and B on the basis of 
“common grounds” like “is larger than”, “is preferable to”, has a “higher priority” 
than or must “prevail on”. An influential link describes how B is affected by A. In 
other words, it describes the way A causes B, increases it, validates it, diminishes it, 
supports it or is related to it. A temporal link indicates if A arrives before B, if it 
precedes it or follows it in time and if it requires more time than the other. A spatial 
link indicates a relative position: under or above, through a plan, in 2D or 3D, from 
left to right, towards East or West, the way to make a cartography of the element, its 
sequential position on a plan and the way to read it. A mathematical link is expressed 
by a symbolism that reflects if one or the other logical condition involving A and B 
is present or if a mathematical representation of A or B can be executed, for exam-
ple, “A is B squared” or “A is a function of B”. A mathematical link can be expressed 
in terms like: “A is a function of B”, “A affects the occurrence probability of B”, “is

48
executable or translatable in algorithms in a server or software”, “is disjointed” or 
“is concomitant”.
Contrary to the relationships between entities, that in practice are very few, the 
elements or entities sensitive to interact in a social systems are countless. It is this 
phenomenon our team is facing by wanting to define and describe the elements and 
components of the community informatics design’s digital social system’s structure 
and process (Chap. 5). In this “normal social science” situation, we have deemed 
appropriate to focus on relationships our intuition considered important and that we 
could best understand a priori for the building of the COLAB. It is pointless to focus 
too much on relationships between elements that are not obvious, and we do not 
master cognitively. The relationships between entities, for example, interactions 
between available socio-digital media and design activities to be accomplished in a 
given context, can be simply identified in a “paired-down” way, according to their 
aspects, their components, their qualities, their properties and their attributes. The 
elements (social and human aspects) and entities (technological objects like infra-
structures and software architectures) can be limited in numbers (which often 
requires a cognitive and collective effort) to make a choice between secondary ele-
ments and prominent ones in a context where the mind if not helped by computer or 
by modeling software. The discovery and strategic alignment matrix we present in 
the present book represent an effort of establishing relations between several ele-
ments/entities in the context of dynamic development that often staggers over long 
periods in delocalized telepresence spaces with vague borders. They can be widely 
used by non-initiated people and by our students in their university work.
With this in mind, among the relationships we have examined, the most impor-
tant ones to notice are the ones whose interaction logic involves transitions in time 
and space. They are evolutive relationships in constant change. We were inspired by 
the state-transition systems theory while “relieving” them of their mathematical 
layer for a use by social and communication sciences practitioners. That type of 
relation “entails … ”, “provokes the emergence of … ” or “springs the following 
elements” is transitive in the following case: if A implies B and B implies C, so A 
implies C.  The propagation and emergence relationships have a direction or an 
intention that provokes mutations or transformations. The transitivity relationships 
also contain expressions like “precede” or “follow”, “is more complicated than … 
”, “is more West to … ”, “evolves towards … ”, and “provokes a change such as … 
”. However, let us note that all relationships are not implicitly transitive; for exam-
ple, the fact that A likes B and that B likes C does not necessarily imply that A likes 
C or even that such a relationship from A to B will automatically create the same 
one with C.
In large-scale complex systems like the digital social systems of “strategic alli-
ance collaborative network between several regions and countries” type, we notice 
a tendency towards long chains of relationships that evolve and propagate in time 
and space and are very difficult to seize by a mind whose cognitive operations are 
not supported by appropriate tools or methodology. For this reason, relationships 
established with the help of natural language that operates through institutions, pos-
tulates and hypotheses will have to be supported by associative processes of 
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

49
­established relations through formal computer languages. The integration of several 
relational dimensions with the help of modeling software, community informatics 
design’s help tools, collective creativity help tools, visual grammar or software like 
Excel that facilitate the organization of complex data, can free social and communi-
cation practitioners from disciplinary constraints related to hard sciences or even 
constraints related to the narrow entities of the word because of object languages 
that are too formal. In the future, in the image of more and more groups of research-
ers in social digital sciences throughout the world, we will try to associate the exer-
cise of modeling process and social systems with the help of digital tools. Thus, we 
wish to face the challenge of working in large partner groups to this deep, dynamic 
logic extended in time that will benefit from a computerized treatment for documen-
tation, qualification of information and simulation.
The deep logic according to Warfield (1986) refers to four or five similar propa-
gation relationships that follow each other in a rather predictable sequence we can 
frame thanks to qualitative identification of certain emergent interaction patterns 
likely to contribute to that evolution of system’s components towards very varied 
results, even unpredictable. In visual modeling languages like the ones the Stella 
software use (documented by Anthony Judge on his site Laetus in Praesens), we can 
describe complex psychosocial relationships like trajectories in a graphic or dia-
grammatic space. The simple problems involve a simple or less articulated logic. 
But complex problems, introduced in the last 10 years to build environments, orga-
nizations and virtual systems more and more complex, are difficult to apprehend 
with a surface logic. In fact, we introduce the idea of deep logic, colleagues are 
often discouraged, which contributes to the socio-technical systems’ representation 
to be often deprived of deep analysis. We can sweep them aside by saying that they 
are soulless systems, determinist, controlling and inhuman. We are wrong because 
these systems are already everywhere. We have to apprehend them with a more 
powerful conceptual equipment because the lack of deep logic in the DSS analysis 
will have a consequence on the creation of systems more or less favourable for the 
human being, like we see every day with Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. These 
systems propagate at the speed of light and have considerable psychological and 
sociological consequences. It belongs to us, artists, researchers, practitioners and 
citizens not to let computing to computer specialists even if they are the first artisans 
of the information society. The sub-conceptualization, sub-theorization and large-­
scale communication pathologies could be the direct consequences.
2.4  Archival Reproduction Tools
The fourth universal antecedent is the representation by archives and digital librar-
ies that refer to the different ways to reach, record, process, manipulate, file, manage 
and share new knowledge by communities of practice. In the social Web context and 
the progression of large virtual libraries like Wikipedia, the mass collaboration 
becomes a science, the “wikinomics” (Tapscott and Williams 2008, 2010). 
2.4  Archival Reproduction Tools

50
Observing the exponential explosion and growth of the number of blog followers 
and the emergence of massive virtual communities dedicated to innovation and 
knowledge sharing, Tapscott and Williams conclude that massive innovation is the 
result of millions of connected individuals who can actively contribute to the infor-
mation society and the capitalization of knowledge. Massive innovation that several 
researchers like Chesbrough et al. (2008) and Von Hippel (2007, 2005) associate to 
the creation of collective wealth, knowledge improvement and social development 
was only a dream until now. When the masses contribute to projects like the ones we 
illustrate in Chap. 10, they can make the arts, education, culture, science, demo-
cratic governance and the economic progress in an innovative and constructive way. 
Organizations and society that currently get involved in the creation of these 
technology-­mediatized social systems on the social Web discover the real meaning 
of the “social capital” concept in appropriation, exchange, memorization and 
knowledge filing activities personalized to all sorts of groups, communities and 
strategic networking alliances. This is why the increase of knowledge and skills in 
the design of these vast socio-technical systems becomes a national priority.
Even if, more and more, the functions we are describing in this section are auto-
mated by agents and “smart librarians”, the future orientation of these systems and 
the “thought sovereignty” requires that we develop these generation skills and 
bringing together the knowledge. This could considerably alienate the current cri-
tique of social media platforms that represent a social situation that any education 
systems must contain or eliminate. The critique is only one of the two necessary 
faces for the creation of future social systems that aim to make the world a bit more 
favourable for the human being. The other is the real capacity to orientate change, 
where lies the importance of design training at all levels of teaching: primary and 
secondary school, college and university. Mass socio-technical system design 
beyond the simple generation of content by users and the co-building of a universal 
database of emerging practices, as they are presented in the next chapters, repre-
sents one of the largest dimensions of our freedom in our society of knowledge.
2.5  The Validation of a Community Informatics Design’s 
Generic Science
Warfield (1986, 1994, and 1999) introduces a validation law and its corollary. He 
affirms that the validity of all science depends on a substantial meaning agreement, 
at its highest degree, within a scientific community, through shared meaning of rela-
tions and interaction definition. Its corollary is that validity of all science depends 
on the capacity of a scientific community to build definitions within the frame of 
relationships’ definition for the entire complex concepts that are involved in the new 
science. This law and its corollary are very difficult to achieve in the present 
research. They establish necessary conditions but insufficient to validate an 
approach. Therefore, other laws must be put to contributions.
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

51
It has become a habit, in social sciences, to resort to quantification of any research 
to answer the scientific models. Certain specific attributes of numbers and statistics 
calculus give quantification an air of respectability. Numbers, because they are uni-
versally understood, can help to quantify computers of a school, the degrees of 
appropriation of social media in an enterprise or the learning curve of a social mod-
eling platform. They help lay the foundations of the validity agreement when it is 
time to specify magnitude orders, proportions and differences between data units. 
However, we all know that in social and communication sciences, important quali-
ties and properties of our systems cannot be distinguished by quantification. The 
sweet clarity associated with numbers cannot systematically be transferred to these 
social systems qualities (ethics, aesthetics, emotional, conflictual and psychologi-
cal) by giving them quantification modes. If quantification can impart a value or 
enrich the validation in connection with the scientific process, it does not implicitly 
give them validity. According to Warfield, validity is obtained thanks to “referential 
transparency”, which commands a “deep logic”. If a science possesses the “referen-
tial transparency”, we are able to trace the logic in both directions through its struc-
ture and process. To achieve the referential transparency (not like the Holy Grail but 
like a certain rigor ideal to be achieved), our researchers team at the ACIL has tried 
to precise the foundations, theories and applications of community informatics 
design for 2 years. We have also made a systemic effort to try to show the feedback 
relations between these different stages of science according to Warfield’s 
prescriptions:
•	 The hypothesis that intervenes in the pragmatic DSS’ design foundations and 
underlying theories
•	 The selection of criteria, dimensions, aspects and fields we have used to create 
our modeling methodology and instantiation from the theories of social systems 
and socio-technical systems involved in the DSS co-design
•	 The roles of stakeholders and the environment (the exostructure or exogenous 
elements) in which DSS design methodology is applied (virtual environments to 
support DSS community informatics design)
•	 The evaluative feedback that applications provide by creating instruments for the 
analysis of social media uses and creativity tools in the DSS design modeling.
The component of interactive methodology and community informatics design’s 
applications constitutes the arena where different types of “participative research 
action”, sociocultural interventions or operational modeling of business models are 
organized and take place. The foundations and theory (concepts, principles and 
abstract prose) represent its corpus. The corpus represents as a whole, in limited 
principle, pieces, written documents or scientific conversations on the Internet and 
documentation elements relative to community informatics design. The constant 
circulation between the corpus and the arena create a living, open, dynamic science; 
it allows to feed the practice, and theories can, in turn, direct practices. It produces 
theories/practices where abstract separation between theory and practice disap-
pears, both being intrinsically linked. It avoids sterile debates between practitioners

52
and theoreticians and between quantophrenia scientific approaches (following the 
expression of Pitirim Sorokin) and research action without theoretical progress.
The absence of constant feedback between the corpus and the arena limits the 
community informatics design in its impact and its validity. It is true that the research 
action, for example, as a very generic methodological position, can discover valu-
able solutions to certain problems in certain intervention environments. But without 
the “conceptual weaving” related to the lessons learned from constraints and diffi-
culties, the research action remains insufficient from the standpoint of the creation 
of a new science like the community informatics design. The community informat-
ics imagination, the aptitude to imagine and make hypothesis on systems that do not 
yet exist, should be based on strong ontological principles (like pragmatism and 
systemism) and a creative and inspiring corpus if it wants to continue to imagine 
solutions to problems more and more complex at a very large scale. In the absence 
of an ontology and epistemology made explicit in the foundations and corpus, the 
research action condemns itself to drive its intentions at a small-scale instead of 
large-scale environments like the “network society” well highlighted by Manuel 
Castells (2011).
Warfield explains as follows the fact that physical sciences, for example, can 
almost perfectly negotiate their success in the arena of methodological and applica-
tive fields without referencing to their foundations and theories. By making it a 
computing representation of deep logic implied in physical sciences oriented 
towards practice, it problematizes their “action landscape” through issues like the 
human being’s nature, made of skills, language, integrator concepts and arithmetic 
and representations systems. He discovers how the measuring system “blocks” the 
interaction between applications and universal antecedents. Normalization that has 
been available in physical sciences for a long time dispenses the scientist to resort 
to constant foundations. Social and communication sciences, which occupy the 
largest part of information systems’ foundations and community information sys-
tems modeling, do not benefit from such normalization. Warfield tells us that as long 
as sciences will not find universally approved measuring systems, they will have to 
be accompanied by a disciplined management of universal antecedents to ensure 
their validity.
The implications of this affirmation are important. Among other things, the 
social science language must be continually confronted to the task of defining terms 
and concepts that are implicitly present in physical and pure in general. It is clear 
that whims and the “vague” aspect of the language make obvious the idea that cre-
ative representations that want to distinguish relations and interactions between 
concepts and fields are one of the necessary conditions of validity and rigor in social 
and communication sciences. Community informatics design and related sciences 
on which they rely (especially computer-assisted collaborative work, HCI, com-
puter-mediatized communication, computer-mediatized social participation, 
human-computer interfaces, the STS sector, Critical Research on Internet, the 
Internet Research domain and Sustainable Democracy development) often require 
“hard science” contributions, like the ones from physics, biology and computer sci-
ence. But they also widely borrow from the imprecise sciences (Moles 1990), and 
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

53
they must widely call upon a creative and rigorous language use, which requires 
definitions by relations/links and semiformal representations towards a prose/
graphic.
We use this attitude throughout this book, by recognizing with humility that our 
effort is well incomplete but is, nevertheless, a contribution in that sense. This is 
why we give a lot of space to the more normalized definition possible of certain 
terms like “model”, “reference framework”, “open innovation” and “instantiation”, 
and two chapters focus on the discovery of “quasi-standards”, meaning relations, 
the discovery and strategic alignment matrix method, to try to standardize our 
approach as well as to master the inherent conceptual complexity.
Even those precautions are not sufficient for the dawning community informatics 
sciences we outline in this book. In keeping with exercising a control over the qual-
ity of production of science or generic interventions, community informatics design 
needs an additional orientation mechanism. For this reason, we will examine an 
exploratory research conducted as part of the APSI that explores the basis of large-­
scale socio-technical systems co-design on the Internet. To do so, we will use the 
Warfield “science field model” as an analysis guide of construction and design of 
online social systems.
At the image of our Professor Abraham Moles who, as early as 1954, was giving 
examples of a way to introduce a rigorous thought in the sciences of vague (sociol-
ogy, psychology, communication, ethnology, anthropology, etc.), Warfield and an 
entire American movement that still goes on today (social system design research-
ers), wanted to show us that even if social and communication sciences are gener-
ally considered imprecise by essence (not as a consequence of a lack of objectivity), 
we can develop means to introduce a rigorous thought to deal with imprecise phe-
nomena like networking intercultural relations, socio-technical design of collabora-
tive platforms, planning and modeling of digital cities and the definition of policies 
on democratic participation by digital platforms (Moles and Rohmer 1986).
2.6  The Object of Community Informatics Design’s Field 
of Science
Community informatics design as a systemic science of construction of digital 
social systems is still in its early phases of creation: it contains a very large diversity 
of points of view, approaches and very diverse concepts regarding its nature, its 
reach, its formalization/standardization degree and its applicability. One of its most 
promising current theories on systems is the social systems design theory (G. S. 
Metcalf 2014; Churchman 1974, 1971, 1968; Banathy 1996, 1992, 1991, 1986; 
Giddens 1984; Fuchs 2008, 2004, 2003; Hofkirchner 2013. 2008), which seems 
particularly well adapted since it is possible to link them to Giddens (1984), 
Habermas (1984) and Luhmann’s sociology (1995, 1989) and to socio-cybernetics. 
After reviewing diverse definitions of science (Bunge 1998; Campbell 1952; 
Chalmers 1999; Kerlinger 1973), as well as several other works related to our

practice and our methodological teaching for 25  years, we have observed and 
retained certain concepts common to science: (1) an object or a field of study, (2) a 
series of concepts defined by a specific language, (3) a philosophy/theory and (4) a 
method for applications. According to Warfield (2006, 1986), the science of systems 
and, a fortiori, a generic community informatics design’s science should be cover-
ing four groups of activities for which he suggests fundamental components that 
integrate science of design and social systems and the socio-technical component 
we are adding to it within the unifying and transdisciplinary community informatics 
design’s frame. Here are the five sciences and their components we adapt to our 
specific field:
	1.	 A description science, which aims to describe problematic situations of any 
nature within the field of activities, for example, the description of components 
of a digital social system taking social aspects and technological aspects, accom-
panied by the description of their fields and integrated properties.
	2.	 A generic design science, for the design of social systems by means of various 
transdisciplines applicable through different disciplines, cultures or organiza-
tional forms that take into account the human being in all his dimensions, think-
ing, ethics, language and systemic concepts oriented towards a sustainable 
society. For example, community informatics design is currently built on multi-
ple bases: design thinking, the complexity sciences, human-computer interfaces 
(HCI), computer-assisted collaborative work (CSCW), evolutive social systems 
design, socio-technical approaches, social and communication sciences, virtual 
communities formal approaches, collaborative networks and living labs, the the-
ory of activity, conversational design, participative culture movements and 
design centred on the human, computer-mediatized communication, computer-­
mediatized social participation, knowledge management, political governance 
and collaborative project management. All these disparate fields could be con-
ceptually consolidated around the idea of Internet research.
	3.	 A complexity science, with the objective to develop dimensions and their qualita-
tive and quantitative measures and to model theoretical principles facilitating the 
understanding and interpretation of the complexity of problematic situations as 
well as the digital social systems design and their methodologies.
	4.	 An action science, to specify methodologies that allow to resolve complex issues 
within the community informatics design’s science field. We resort to an 
ontology/epistemology of action that allows not only the construction of virtual 
communities of all sorts but also the interactive management, the modeling of 
dialogic design’s science, living labs, fab labs, colabs, social platforms and dem-
ocratic and participation platforms for digital diplomacy.
	5.	 A communication and language science.
The five italicized terms represent the five major components of the social sys-
tems theory. These five sciences and subdisciplines integrated their perspectives to 
contribute to the knowledge basis of the community informatics design and to 
resolve the problematic situations of any nature, especially those of the large-scale 
digital social systems development dedicated to sustainable development. The five

meta-sciences provide “objective” bases for the definition of large-scale systems 
design, involving technological and social components, for example, virtual com-
munities or strategic inter-enterprise alliances. To adapt them to today’s world, our 
team has decided to define them, following Warfield and Christakis (1987), like 
systems of socio-­technical nature. Such systems involve the evolutive emergence of 
subsystems that combine social systems (soft) and technological systems (hard). We 
can say that any pair of elements derived from science (S) and technology (T) is 
emerging/evolutive in a context C or a design situation D, if an S+T fusion reveals 
the generation of a new element V that does not preserve the individual identity of 
any original elements. For example, when the social appropriation of a technology 
from a collaborative platform merges with an organization, it may result in a new 
community information system allowing network innovations that could not occur 
within the ancient system of human activities. This new socio-technical system has 
to be analysed according to its emerging properties, from its social and technical 
components.
A social system is a configuration of actors in interaction. According to Anthony 
Giddens (1984), a social system is a set of interactions located in time and space. 
Giddens distinguishes several social systems: organizations, groups, social move-
ments and societies as widen social systems. Peter Checkland (1981) presents a 
complete definition of the social system as a human activity system. While natural 
systems and engineer systems cannot be anything other than what they are, the 
human activity systems manifest themselves through the perception of human 
beings, who are free to assign a variety of meaning to what they perceive. There is 
never a unique way to report human activity systems; we observe a series of possi-
ble configurations, all valid according to a particular world vision. Considering the 
human being and its abilities, we have an important array of human activity systems 
on a continuum that goes from the individual handling a computer to international 
network political platform and enterprise portals (perspective of an observation con-
tinuum observation that goes from micro to macro through meso). A social system 
model is a configuration of roles that, together with the help of a script, report the 
interaction between different roles played by individuals or partners of organization 
stakeholders. Community informatics design of a social system consists of develop-
ing scripts and its roles as human activity systems aiming at producing technical or 
social artefacts.
A technical system is a series of artefacts, like communication, collaboration or 
coordination tools that interact in a DSS design project, according to intentions of a 
practice community and design activities it plans. Socio-technical information sys-
tems researchers instruct us to increase our knowledge about Web tools and their 
interactions with human activity systems. Cognitive mastery and collective design 
skills as well as human activities’ tool configuration become the new conditions of 
our freedom and imagination in the innovation and democratic participation of the 
future. We must ethically direct their contents and design. The European living labs 
and the American colabs are recognized for helping many groups of non-expert 
users to come together in order to generate their content and create the design and 
the personalized applications that meet their needs. A socio-technical system is born

56
and grows with the dynamic fusion of a social system S and a technical system T, to 
produce a socio-technical system V. From the moment when we recognize that a 
social system is dynamic and evolutive and that any dynamic system integrates 
another dynamic subsystem, we say that any socio-technical system is a dynamic 
and evolutive system. The integration of the social system and the technical system 
results in a socio-technical system. With the current social Web and the future 
Internet of Things, we have the possibility of building not only mirror sites but all 
new online institutions (Ostrom and Hess 2011) such as scientific communes medi-
ated by ICT or the entities of the Internet of Things, we have a complex permanent 
socio-technical system. We have a mission and duty to direct them in a direction that 
is more favourable to the human being rather than the one illustrated in the tyranny 
and the abuse we see in the current social media. We call them “digital social sys-
tems”; they will be co-built with a whole new social media interactive and participa-
tive design: the community informatics design.
The script of a digital social system, like a virtual community, will be built thanks 
to community informatics design using the following definition of community on 
three levels according to a conception inspired by socio-technical design:
	1.	 A socio-dynamic system supported by computer collaborative networks and 
applicative programs (like network infrastructures, educational platforms like 
Moodle, wikis and blogs).
	2.	 The continuous collaboration validation through computer-mediatized commu-
nication and computer-mediatized social participation. The digital communica-
tion is regulated and structured by general interaction procedures, common 
interests and particular collaborative modes instrumentalized (Lemire 2008) by 
creativity, design and modeling tools and general interaction intentions such as 
knowledge management and social networking we find on Wikipedia or 
Facebook.
	3.	 Collaboration and emotions related to the being and to the birth of multiple and 
shared identity and common values that can be born from computer-mediatized 
communication and the appropriation of computer-mediatized social participa-
tion tools emerge in activities of the community. This level is far from being 
reached in all virtual communities because several DSS are currently built on 
competition, the accumulation of identity differences and overrated reputations 
or a lack of ethics.
Community informatics, a recent face of communication’s applied sciences, has 
been traditionally developed under the social informatics label (Kling 1973, 1996, 
1999, 2007; Kling et al. 2001, 2005) and is also designated by expressions like 
“community networking”, “social Web”, “social media”, “cybercommunities”, 
“networking electronic communities”, “socio-digital networks”, “community-­
oriented technologies”, “collaborative networks”, “computer-mediatized social par-
ticipation”, “participative design”, “participative research action” and “co-design”. 
According to Gurstein (2006), one of the founding fathers of the field, community 
informatics refers to a series of principles and practices including the use of infor-
mation technologies and communication for the social, cultural, political and 
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

57
­economic development in the communities, by the communities and by their inter-
vention. Community informatics, as a new academic discipline, has, until now, been 
developing within older disciplines like information systems and social computing. 
With living labs and colabs oriented on vast communities and large-scale massive 
innovation, the notion of design oriented towards users has occupied a substantial 
place in documentation dedicated to the subject. We will see that currently, with the 
meta-design and the human oriented design (Krippendorff 2007), the virtual com-
munities movement promote, more and more, collective practices oriented not only 
on the production of contents but also on all sorts of fields related to design think-
ing1 at the service of innovation, human development and the democratic conscience 
of the majority.
In addition, today, community informatics is associated with terms like “social 
intelligence” and “collaborative intelligence” in fields like social psychology; socio-
cultural animation by community media; communication sciences; located or dis-
tributed cognition; artificial intelligence; complex systems modeling; the Internet of 
the future; the Web 2.0, 3.0 and even 4.0; and critical approaches of the social Web. 
We can consider it like a transdisciplinary approach that uses ICT to create, in a 
participative and collaborative way, the design of all sorts of action communities 
aiming the innovation creation like living labs, practice communities, collective 
intelligence processes, learning organizations, assisted design social platforms, 
health grids, knowledge-building communities, open innovation communities and 
mutual design help communities. We will see that as an applied discipline, it can 
benefit from several disciplines to guide its actions on the field and suggest concrete 
instantiation methodologies of people and communities’ intentions. In this context 
where social and communication action gives it a field practice character oriented 
on digital social systems co-design of the future, we call it “community informatics 
design”.
However, community informatics design goes beyond the simple tool configura-
tion on a website. In addition, it is not only interested in the generalized improvisa-
tion in the establishment of DSS by non-initiated communities. While recognizing 
the dynamism of certain practices, it rather validates the use appropriation of tech-
nologies to develop in a systematic and rigorous manner digital social systems like 
the communities that transcend the creation of unbridled social platforms and oppo-
site to ethics, to rather try to engage people in processes and communication activi-
ties that are socially responsible. For example, develop common intentions and 
visions through different types of language that do not only speak of innovations 
and artefacts but that give them their shared meanings. Sharing objectives, values, 
value beliefs and a responsible ethics regarding others analyses the activity flow in 
collaborative network at work, at home and in the local or global communities. 
Also, evaluate the stakeholders’ roles and partners in the co-creation of a future 
digital social system and facilitate groups and resolve conflicts with the help of 
modeling and representation tools. Plan collaborative networks projects of all sorts 
in the service of human development and their ethical governance.

In the next section, we will deepen the social and socio-technical principles that 
should guide the users/designers in their creation of future social systems. For the 
moment, let us simply mention that the community informatics designer needs to 
develop an excellent understanding of what is socially desirable, technically and 
economically feasible, legitimate, transparent and ethical in the creation of online 
interactions of all sorts. The community informatics designer also needs to under-
stand well all technology affordances tool functionalities and their constraints. He 
must learn to align the tools with the community needs and objectives, how tools 
can be related to each other, inter-operationally configured and integrated in new 
evolutive ecosystems: the digital social systems. In short, the entire effort of the 
UQAM’s applied community informatics lab consists of showing that, beyond the 
current improvisation in the Internet structuring, a semiformal approach does not 
aim to stifle users’ creativity or imagination, quite the contrary, but to direct practi-
cally and ethically.
The websites, hubs, portals and virtual organization’s co-design cannot be left to 
chance, without taking into account the several skills that allow it to involve govern-
ments, universities, enterprises and civil society in motivating projects for the econ-
omy and society. The context and virtual work environments become more and 
more complex, and they provoke more and more indignation, a loss of trust and 
fears because of not appropriate uses. We have the unique desire and opportunity to 
massively guide the change with the support of new information and communica-
tion technologies and technologies that are in a constant state of change and evolu-
tion. Community informatics design aims to optimize social and technological 
change and to represent a new intelligence technology that requires a deep under-
standing of logic (relations, links, strategic alignment between tools and social 
needs). This requirement has become necessary by the constant innervation of the 
social global tissue of social media, regarding the training of young people who will 
know that in an evolutive world, the community informatics design represents a 
promising contribution of orientation and cognitive, social, cultural and economic 
support of our societies.
2.7  Community Informatics Design’s Field of Science
Now, let us come back to the structuring of the community informatics design field 
of science according to Warfield’s works that will allow us to describe the essential 
elements we must establish in accordance with Charles Sanders Pierce’s orientation 
philosophy. The model explains the interaction concepts such as the foundations, 
the theory, the methodology and the applications of the community informatics 
design while making sure we describe their reciprocal links we believe it is possible 
to integrate parts of disciplines in the new community informatics design transdis-
cipline. The Warfield model can help us with this task because it offers an attempt 
to classify sciences in general and conceptual sciences in particular.
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

59
Warfield tells us that to ensure the referential transparency of a generic design 
science, and this applies to community informatics design in particular, we must 
strive to propose three communicational interfaces. One is the interface between 
researchers/producers of the new science and the users/practitioners of problem-­
solving and planning of the digital social systems design. A second interface must 
be suggested between community informatics experts involved in the co-creation of 
the future digital social system and the administrative partners and project managers 
that provide governance modes and appropriate orientations for the objectives. A 
third interface consists of setting up interactions between the administrative person-
nel and citizens. We add a fourth interface the Europeans would call a “partnership 
helix” between governments, universities, enterprises and citizens. This helix offers 
an identification systemic of different partners’ roles. Furthermore, in the current 
globalization context, where the problem of resource scarcity and sustainable devel-
opment becomes the world’s priority, we add a fifth interface that contains all the 
others: the environment and the ecosystems that contain experts and non-initiated 
humans; social, cultural and technological dimensions; ecological environments; 
and multi-profession partner helix around the director concept of sustainable devel-
opment. Current global issues command these new communication structures in the 
information society. Figure  2.1 illustrates this partnership helix model. (Source: 
Carayannis and Campbell own conceptualization based on Etzkowitz and 
Leydesdorff (2000, p. 112), Carayannis and Campbell (2009, p. 207; 2012, p. 14; 
2013) and Danilda et al. (2009))
The complexity governance brought by these new interfaces organized in the 
Internet networks and the “partnership helix” metaphor represents one of the main 
community informatics design contributions to the cognitive mastery of new social 
systems and their collaborative management in the new virtual environments. The 
multiplication and structuring of new social links of vast turban issues, related to 
risk situations or ecological disasters, force society to equip itself with means of 
quick understanding of global issues by suggesting interfaces and innovative part-
nerships, while maintaining a cooperative management through the flexible cycles 
of life and adapted to different design situations.
Besides the complexification of new problems our societies are facing more and 
more the necessity to make the new governance modes’ design to face it, we have to 
manage complexity in other fields. We must reduce the “virtual cognitive world” 
information overload from the individuals and find appropriate dialogue modes to 
create necessary consensus for action in various types of communities. We must 
find new projects’ life cycles, adaptable to this complexity that requires united 
behaviours and communities ready to face global changes.
Current design situations exceed the perception of individual problems and the 
capacity of human communities to face the set of their components. All sorts of col-
laborative tools are currently available to help individuals and groups to master this 
complexity, to model it, to simulate it for the purpose of social action and intentional 
social change. Warfield can help us to synthesize the functionalities relative to a 
correct community informatics design. These functionalities are validation and 
improvement tools for the design process. They take into consideration the design

and environment description process, identification of roles, governance criteria, 
leadership and the quality control by paying special attention to the sociocultural 
environment. We add a value table and an ethic design approach to it. We will come 
back to it at length in the sections dedicated to community informatics design 
instantiation strategies.
2.8  Community Informatics Foundations
As we have seen, Warfield distinguishes four universal antecedents of a design sci-
ence: the human being, the language, the reasoning by links and the archival repre-
sentation modes. By developing these concepts and by linking them to each other, 
he provides the essential context that fills the gaps of several sciences, especially 
information and communication systems applied sciences and major socio-­technical 
systems developed in collaborative networks on the Internet. The universal anteced-
ents’ science and community informatics object serve as the foundations of the 
community informatics design generic science. In the present section, we propose a 
detailed presentation of the science model foundations according to Warfield.

According to Christakis and Flanagan (2011), the field of science models 
(FOSM) presented by Warfield in 1986 was not sufficiently appreciated for its heu-
ristic value in the creation of a new scientific field like the community informatics 
design. The FOSM cannot only provide useful knowledge to better understand the 
intentions of a science but also highlights the foundations of this science, nominally 
the objects of a scientific field like the community informatics design that can ana-
lytically extend itself to various aspects of its development, the application ontology 
and the theories as well as their links with methodology. As we have already men-
tioned, today’s human beings must live and work with large-scale systems where 
technology applications largely exceed an individual capacity to analyse these sys-
tems and intervene upon them (e.g. large artificial intelligence systems or cyber-­
physical social systems). It becomes important to put into perspective the way the 
scientific actors build a field and interact between them and with practitioners, engi-
neers or computer experts. How do they perform cultural mediation between this 
science and the applications grounds? How do sponsors and subsidy organizations 
mediatize between them this science to other researchers and various concerned 
audience? In order to shed light on these partnership interactions, we will describe 
the FOSM by trying to present a few restrictions and some extensions to the com-
munity informatics design field.
•	 The restrictions refer to a conceptual knowledge base that incorporates only a 
part of the FOSM’s elements.
•	 The extensions contain knowledge bases that go beyond community informatics 
design to expend to fields related to science’s universal antecedents.
This conceptual exam will cause us to conclude that today, the construction of 
democratic user/designer platforms that is dedicated to large-scale human and sus-
tainable development can be submitted to restrictions related to formal operating 
fields (applied aspects appliqués of interventions in the field), while other restric-
tions are the fruit of an incompetence to relate community informatics design’s 
foundation (the FOSM applied to our field) universal antecedents of all sciences. 
Our will to shed light on these problems go beyond the framework of this present 
chapter. This study on its own could be the object of an entire other book. However, 
even by retaining a schematic writing, we believe this discussion on community 
informatics design’s foundations supported by 40 years of application is indispens-
able for a dawning science.
Our intention is to briefly show the community informatics design’s foundations, 
as a science that relies on various modes of dialogue, and to make connections 
between these modes and complex digital social systems design, in order to make 
them more transparent in referential terms and to make it a helping tool for our 
students and users/designers of all horizons that would be interested in these foun-
dations for their sustainable development and intentional social change works. This 
effort represents a first step in the identification commitment entries and the mobi-
lization of members of a practice community and users/designers of living labs in 
front of the extent of some DSS projects. The Warfield approach adopted by our 
team as an analysis guide and the FOSM systemic orientation use are appropriate to 
2.8  Community Informatics Foundations

62
all sciences and community informatics design, in particular in their conceptual, 
methodological and applicative aspects. They are relevant to the extent of several 
stakeholders and R-D partners form an innovation community where it is important 
to define the role of each one, which is far from being an easy task.
The referential transparency study of community informatics design of digital 
social systems stems from years of theorization in the design science and in the 
practice of the dialogic design (Christakis and Bausch 2006; Christakis 2005, 1987; 
Christakis and Harris 2004). It is useful to recall axioms and main components of 
these sciences too often considered like sciences without foundations having a large 
practice field. The field feeds theories and the theory guides the praxis. Furthermore, 
we must recognize that the most influential communication and contemporary dia-
logic “design thought” belongs to the field of the design sciences applications in situ 
and not by telepresence and sociocultural animation modes of today. The FOSM 
requires that from the applications developed for years in workshops in person, 
meaning without the generalized help of technology, we could evaluate if, in view 
of the important evolution of living labs, colabs and other forms of Internet demo-
cratic participation/creation, our current practice communities possess ways and the 
necessary tools to revise the validity of its basic axioms. Such a foundation revision 
is now mandatory by the great current society debates that question the role and 
power of social sciences in the evolution of the current network society as diverse 
design sciences find themselves in a generalized evolution process of in-person 
accompanying towards more and more complex accompanying of practice through 
means of collaborative tools and social Internet platforms.
The FOSM possesses the virtue of illustrating the distinctions of four fields spe-
cific to any science, the distinctions between the corpus and the field (arena) in the 
generic framework of a science activities. Figure 2.2 shows that this model created 
in 1986 will help us to understand the evolution of the community informatics 
design as well as the potential impact of its current development stage on social sci-
ences. The model contains the foundations that guide the theories, the theories that 
guide the methodologies and the methodologies and techniques that we can put into 
practice when a design context or situation demand it, as well as applications that 
are specific to today’s collaborative design (participative platforms, agoras, living 
labs, colabs). First of all, we will present this model with its restrictions and its pos-
sible extensions to communication design sciences and socially responsible net-
working. And second, we will present its application to community informatics 
design.
Within the community informatics design’s field of science, we distinguish four 
“open” blocks specific to the model, which start with the applications foundations 
and go to the theories and methodologies. Each block literally feeds its successor 
and acts retroactively on its predecessor in a never-ending evolutive spiral that goes 
from science to its applications and from applications to science.
Combinations  The combination of blocks constitutes the science under construc-
tion (Fig. 2.2 science). The corpus of science is a subsystem that only involves 
foundations and theories. The arena only involves methodologies and applications.
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

63
If the methodology is presented by Warfield as an integral part of science, it is 
nevertheless clearly possible to suggest, to develop and to use a methodology that 
does not have a clear connection with the corpus and that is strictly produced for the 
purpose of satisfying the needs of the arena or an explicit field. It is without a doubt 
one of the most obvious characteristics of the current design of sciences (sciences 
of conception according to Simons 2005) in all sorts of application fields, products, 
services, artefacts and social systems. For example, most current large-scale proj-
ects in the field of ubiquitous computing and social Web, guided towards applica-
tions and methodologies, do not draw their existence nor their orientation from a 
corpus nor an explicit and transparent conceptual framework. Rather, it is drawn 
from limited and volunteer initiatives of methodological transfers more or less 
appropriate between disciplines from the will of sponsors of enthusiastic consul-
tants’ discourses.
Connections  The four connections in Fig. 2.2 represent the links between the 
blocks we can identify as a feedback cycle between 1-Foundation/Theory, 2-Theory/
Methodology and 3-Methodology/Applications and the feedback end of cycle with 
4-Applications/Foundations or with the abbreviations FT, TM, MA, AF. They cor-
respond to the four following block’s orientation and organization functions, which 
allows to create an iterative virtuous circle benefitting the improvement of a science 
quality.

2.9  Community Informatics Design’s Four Fields and Its 
Application to DSS: General Vision
Like so, we will use the constituent elements of the FOSM to present the commu-
nity informatics design like a “design-for-all” science and like a type of systemic 
and practice research that involves both the social systems theories and the socio-­
technical approaches.
The systemic research centred on design of digital social systems includes the 
four Warfield’s FOSM interdependent fields (1986; Warfield and Christakis 1987): 
the philosophical foundations, the theories, the methodologies and the applications. 
According to Banathy and Jenlink (2005), the philosophical foundations of social 
systems are made of three dimensions: ontology (that defines the components of the 
reality to be analysed or built), epistemology (a knowledge theory) and axiology (a 
system of goals, values, beliefs and ethics). The ontology dimension lies on a sys-
temic vision of the DSS to be built, based on pragmatism (philosophy of action) and 
praxeology (science of action). It transcends the DSS vision designed like static 
systems (e.g. the Internet of “Things”) towards a social systems vision (educational 
system, healthcare system, enterprise model, as Social Internet of Things), as 
dynamic and open living systems, a vision that recognizes the primacy of relational-­
organizing-­self-organizing-evolutive processes.
The epistemology contains at least three fields of research. First, it studies the 
change, co-design or co-evolution process of a social system within which the 
research and development take place (a system called “design system research 
space”). In this design exploratory space, it produces knowledge to understand 
how the design systems will transform the work activity system (Engeström 1999), 
community networking practices, interpersonal relations and collaborative net-
work organizational interrelations. We introduce a third space within the frame-
work of principles and values of socio-technical approaches in organizational 
communication like human-computer interfaces (Hochheiser and Lazar 2007) that 
correspond to the “universal design” values (Fuchs and Obrist 2010) valorizing the 
appropriation of social technologies, the contents generated by the user and the 
design centred on the human being (Krippendorff 2007; Hofkirchner 2007; Fuchs 
and Obrist 2010). These approaches valorize the Technology Mediatized Social 
Participation (TMSP) domain (Preece and Shneiderman 2009), the collaboration 
and sustainable development field (Rico de Sotelo 2008, 2011; Agbobli and Hsab 
2011) and similar approaches we find in the work on social design theories and 
also, the whole field of “Community Networking” that the International ICT com-
munity put forward during the two World Summits on Information Society (WSIS) 
in 2003 (Geneva) and 2006 (Tunis). The systemic research axiology dedicated to 
community informatics design of digital social systems that are favourable to men 
and civil society puts forwards a preoccupation for moral qualities, ethics and 
systems’ aesthetics. It is particularly interested in social justice, equity and toler-
ance, to intercultural relations, to the facilitation of a social consensus through 
various dialogue modes, to social media development at the service of the 
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

65
community, to sustainable development through responsible development as well 
as to participative democracy.
The theories (the corpus) result from this philosophy and adopt a transdisci-
plinary approach that articulates the numerous concepts and principles of the theo-
ries of change in social and communication sciences, as well as the ones from 
diverse types of Internet domains previously mentioned in this book: for example, 
the commitment of users in digital ecosystem planning, the cultural intervention 
strategies supported by social media, the user’s involvement in contents and design, 
the use of open-source code technology for socio-economic innovation, the social 
appropriation of collaborative and creative tools, the participation in the decision-
making and democratic governance of ecosystem, the construction of virtual com-
munities of all types and with various intentions, interconnected sociability, 
co-design and the improvement of all citizens “digital skills” as well as the pleasure 
of being together and playing videogames at home. Collaborative intelligence, 
motivation, trust, well-being, quality of life and generalized collaboration for the 
benefit of all citizens are fundamental concepts in community informatics design. 
Community informatics design aims to adapt these principles and articulate them in 
a transdisciplinarity to intentional systemic change of our real/digital social systems 
or as human activities in cyberspace systems.
The methodological system includes three fields of study:
	1.	 The study of methods by which knowledge and the community informatics 
design’s knowledge basis are generated, the identification and description of 
applications strategies, information collection tools (ethnographic methods, 
qualitative research, questionnaire, discussion groups, case studies), collabora-
tive tools and platforms (socio-collaborative media), DSS configuration and 
instantiation methods like discovery and strategic alignment matrices of DSS 
objective tools, cooperative management and the organization of development 
principles
	2.	 The study of the models used to build a support model for community informat-
ics design research and the co-building of DSS according to stakeholders’ objec-
tives and the consolidation of their intentions/orientations through various 
modeling and visual representation modes
	3.	 The evaluation and appropriation of various reflection modes (Ranjan 2007; 
Burnette 2009) and dialogues (Bohm 1998, 1996) to facilitate user/designer 
practice communities and the diverse languages used for the tool configuration 
or the programming of a particular collaborative platform in accordance with an 
objective.
The application field (the arena) has close links with methodology. It takes place 
in functional contexts of intentions’ realization in relation with the design of a com-
plex solution through the DSS instantiation strategy created from a reference model. 
In fact, it refers to the interaction dynamic and the foundation’s translation (the 
philosophy), theory (the corpus) and methodology (the arena) in a social action 
system catalysed by the DSS and thanks to it. In the present book, we describe for 
the first time the entire set of fields that allowed us to build a DSS model through a 
transdisciplinary and multi-methodological process. It is a community informatics

design helping systems of other DSS with its norms and concrete instantiation strat-
egy through means of reflection modes and an iterative imagination process.
Through dialogue and languages, we not only observe the world, we “blend it 
into the practice” (Craig 1999, 2006; Krippendorff 2007; Morin 1982, 1985). This 
way, philosophy, theory, methodology and the applications of social systems come 
to life as varied transdisciplinary discourses that blend community informatics 
design into the four fields and that applies it in the functional and operating context 
of research on theory and systemic design just like the communication and social 
science systemic approaches used and applied in the DSS. It is in the practical con-
text of action and systemic research applications in social systems design and vir-
tual organizations that the philosophy, theory and methodology are confirmed, 
readjusted, modified and disputed. The systemic pragmatic philosophy, at the base 
of community informatics design, provides the values, beliefs, the hypothesis and 
the perspectives that guide us into the action by defining and organizing the “rela-
tional arrangements” of concepts and principles that constitute it. The systemic phi-
losophy and theory dynamically interact to guide us in the co-building, the 
decision-making and the organization of choices for the approaches, strategies, lan-
guages, methods and collaborative tools related to the epistemology frameworks of 
digital social systems action. The systemic methodology and its socio-constructive 
applications interact to guide us in the confirmation of our intentions, the necessity 
to reorientate our activities or to stay the course, to transform or modify the theory 
or the systemic epistemology. Each of the four fields acts retroactively on the others 
and on the whole community informatics field of science. These four described 
fields constitute the conceptual system of the systemic research in digital social 
systems’ design. As we will see further along, this influence relation of a field on 
another is recursive, commanding an iterative approach; it is multi-aspect and 
multimodal.
2.10  Community Informatics Design Science: A Specific 
Vision According to the Four Fields (Blocks)
Since the introduction of the FOSM and the presentation of social systems design 
10 years later, in 1996,2 until the current emergence of colabs and living labs, all 
sciences and all sectors of society and organization living have been affected by 
socio-technical innovations resulting from the progression of the Internet, social 
networks and now computer-mediatized collaboration social technologies. This 
context promotes the emergence of a transdisciplinarity in several fields, which in 
turn commands a certain basic philosophical positioning. This represents an intel-
lectual challenge.

2.10.1  The Foundations (Block 1)
The applied community informatics lab (ACIL) is basing its works on a general 
philosophy of transdisciplinarity that has been developed by Francis Heylighen 
(2007) and his colleagues by creating, over 20 years ago, the group on evolution, 
complexity and cognition (ECCO). The conceptual framework of the ECCO group 
leans upon philosophical foundations based on an action ontology that considers 
that constituents of reality are the actions and the agents (actors or techniques) pro-
ducing them. With the birth of a network society (Castells), more and more phe-
nomena and projects are designed like self-organized and evolutive networks that 
develop to become systems more and more complex, adaptive, intelligent and col-
laborative. The result is a world vision that allows us to integrate the more funda-
mental problem of the science philosophy we have previously presented (like in 
Banathy’s work) in addition to suggesting three others, ontology, epistemology and 
axiology, already presented in Warfield’s FOSM as fundamental foundations com-
ponents, with the help of Heylighen’s works (2007) and his colleagues, we add 
metaphysics, praxeology and futurology.
This vision tackles more particularly problems surrounding the duality of mind/
matter, or cognition/society, including the intentional origins and the subjective 
experience as well as the relations between perspectives of the first person (the 
world observer of the first phase science), the second person (two observers con-
fronting their world visions, second phase of science) and the third person (Basarab 
Nicolescu “included third” several observers acting on the world in the third phase 
of science). It succeeds by extending the intentional position from the simpler 
agents, elementary particles like the Higgs boson and atoms from the standard phys-
ics theory. In addition, according to Heylighen (2007), a world vision based on 
action can support a diversity of applications, including the design of self-organized 
technological systems like the digital social systems that aim to mobilize people to 
work in a motivated and coordinated way and any system supporting collaborative 
development and socio-construction of knowledge networks.
The clarification of this conceptual framework has two main advantages. First, it 
suggests a world vision that gives the community informatics design’s foundations 
as a self-organized system. Second, it gives us a practice method to create collabora-
tive Web systems, the “digital social systems”, like Wikipedia, the living labs, the 
colabs and the participative science portals. Furthermore, it provides a collection of 
methods, stigmergy strategies and technologies capable of supporting the self-­
organization of virtual communities and the collaborative intelligence, especially 
the self-organization of the interaction between people, who, together, will develop 
innovation communities or complex management and knowledge sharing systems.
Without getting into the details of the ECCO group philosophy, we will try to 
offer a few definitions and to examine its process with a few adaptations.
The ECCO group’s ontology maintains that the fundamental components of real-
ity are actions and agents. It is the elementary processes or transitions between 
interdependent states of eternal matter components. Therefore, their ontology is 
2.10  Community Informatics Design Science: A Specific Vision According…

68
fundamentally holistic and dynamic and reductionist. Interactions contribute to the 
emergence of organizations, social systems, virtual organizations and digital social 
systems. As these organizations and social systems emerge on the Internet, they 
manifest more and more perfected forms of distributed cognition, shared under-
standing and collective and collaborative intelligence; in other words, they develop 
collective skills to make enlightened choices between the actions. This ontology 
rejects the traditional dualist hypothesis that sees the mind and the matter as two 
separate entities, like two constituents of realities interdependent on one another. 
The matter and the mind are simply two aspects of the same basic actions 
network.
2.10.1.1  Metaphysics
If we could go back in time to the origins of the universe, we would see the agents 
and systems becoming more and simpler until losing all forms of complexity or 
organization. The organized forms we see around us are explained by a process 
called “blind variation” that produces random combinations of agents and actions 
and the natural selection process that retains only the “strongest” combinations, the 
ones that adapt or internally align best one with each other and externally with their 
environment. We will see that this adaptation process continues today on the 
Internet, in the context of natural and specialized languages that serve to establish 
and guide actions within digital social systems.
Futurology  is a generic process that postulates that this complexification/adapta-
tion can be extrapolated towards the future. It allows us to try to predict that, in the 
medium term, conflicts and frictions between human communities will decrease or 
increase, the cooperation and collaboration will expand worldwide and the quality 
of life will grow. Also, individuals will become more and more integrated in the 
socio-technical systems surrounding them, while human cognition and collective 
intelligence will increase significantly. In the long term, this prediction faculty will 
intensify with the social action and interaction between organization simulation and 
digital social systems, sciences and human development tools like the community 
informatics design. This will bear resemblance with the simulation in environmen-
tal sciences, while social sciences will use different simulation tools to better under-
stand and intervene on social phenomena. In fact long-term survival of our specie 
depends not only on prediction and projective studies but also on the development 
of human capacities to consciously realize systems co-design that will be more 
favourable. This capacity and these anticipatory skills in the social appropriation of 
collaborative technologies are an alternative solution to traditional futurology that 
has always faced the natural evolution process with trial and error. This process in 
its essence is nonpredictable since we have to be ready to face large-scale unex-
pected issues that will punctuate the human evolution through the next decades.
Axiology  postulates that evolution’s internal engine, or the implicit value that gov-
erns life, is the adaptation/alignment, which is survival, growth and development. 
The ECCO group agrees with the fact that in the current situation, this ­fundamental 
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

69
value can translate into a universal and sustainable quality of life or a generalized 
joie de vivre. In the present book, we will see that these values can translate into the 
evolutive and systemic design of social systems as advocated by community infor-
matics design in the context of social theories, theories on computer-­human inter-
faces and the theory of systems that will allow the contribution of a series of other 
values in support of this major value that invites us to orientate our future towards 
the adaptation of a more human-friendly world which is necessary to our long-term 
survival. These values are the openness, the connectedness, the tolerance, the dis-
covery of the positive properties of social systems, freedom, harmony, collabora-
tion, knowledge, self-control, health and a coherent world vision with these too 
often neglected aspects in our large-scale socio-technical systems. In the long term, 
this means that the capacity of alignment of the man with the world has to increase 
our capacity of generative and evolution alignment capacities beyond our living 
conditions that currently prevail in our societies. Actions and human activity sys-
tems that will favour a better integration of all in the world will be considered like 
good; the other actions will have to be progressively removed.
Praxeology  allows us to update these values in concrete life and to avoid various 
obstacles. Information sciences, systems theory and cognitive and social sciences 
have adopted several of these attitudes by suggesting various tools and strategies to 
take on the challenge of building large-scale complex systems like socio-technical 
systems. Today, computer-assisted collaborative work and the field of human-­
computer interfaces use it to reflect on their practices in the action. According to 
Alexandre Lhotellier and Yves St-Arnaud (1994), who introduced Donald Schön’s 
work on “knowing in practice” in Quebec, praxeology is an approach built on (aim, 
method, process) empowerment and the awareness of the action (at all levels of 
social interaction) in its history, in its everyday practices, in its changing process 
and in its consequences. The praxeological approach finds its foundations in the 
nature of the action (activities aiming a result ordered by intentions). Everything 
begins by reflecting on the sense of the communication act that contains an inten-
tion, an effectiveness, a symbolic, a meaning and an individual and social transfor-
mation. Praxeology cannot be integrated to pragmatism, only focusing on success, 
and even less to utilitarianism, that is guided by its actors’ interests. It is a contribu-
tion to society’s well-being that seeks to become more conscious of itself while 
guiding more consciously its future and its development.
Praxeology offers an important contribution to social and communication sci-
ences and implicitly to community informatics design because it reconciles, for 
action efficiency reasons, both poles that applied science nor research action has 
been able to integrate. In accordance to evolutive design theories conscious of our 
societies, it is a contribution to social empowerment of groups and communities to 
the well-being togetherness of a society that is built more consciously. We cannot 
mention theory without linking it to practice, because it would only be an abstract 
discourse plated on something concrete, nor can we ignore the feedback of the prac-
tice on theory. The community informatics design approach (feedback, collabora-
tive design, anticipation, description and relations, interaction and hierarchical 
decomposition, heuristic research, stigmergic coordination, discover and strategic

70
alignment matrices, socio-technical approaches, social systems design) is a funda-
mental praxeological approach. It is reflexive and not only conceptual: it is not just 
a practice’s conceptualization.
2.10.1.2  The Epistemology
To resolve problems and plan the action, we need the appropriate knowledge. 
Knowledge is not limited only to and objective reflection on reality nor to a simple 
model only useful to make predictions. Different problems can require different 
models of a same reality, without any providing the ultimate truth, the true represen-
tation. However, models containing a greater explanatory extend or that improve 
our understanding of a phenomenon are intrinsically better. Models stemming from 
cognitive or social sciences can help us better comprehend how our budding social 
systems grow and die. We should favour those who help distinguish interaction pat-
terns between various components of a socio-technical system and develop collab-
orative tools more and more adapted to the online social systems modeling/simulation.
Needless to say, the FOSM can help us reduce the divide between fundamental 
sciences and applied sciences. It also helps to characterize the “orientation func-
tions” that link the axiomatic foundations to the praxis. It is important for all sci-
ences to explicitly recognize the axioms on which they are founded, because 
discovery disparities in the applications can be understood as the manifestation of a 
deficient axiomatic comprehension or a gap in the basic theories’ considerations. 
Regarding the corpus of science or basic science, the community informatics design 
of digital social systems already possesses an axiomatic foundation based on more 
than 40 years of practice around the comprehension of evolutive systems of the 
“reality” experienced in the arena of participative and interactive design practice. It 
is the theory that inspires those axioms, in particular approaches like dialogic 
design, conversational design, cognitive sciences, social systems design and the 
theory of relations. The arena where applied science shares the methodology 
includes praxeology allowing to act and reflect upon practice or theories from sci-
ence. It puts this methodology in the applications with which it has “action inter-
faces” that engage the science practitioner (the subject). In the arena, the individual 
and stakeholders are represented by communities of practice, living labs and colabs 
discovering the relations between concepts, performing the action design and plan-
ning and modeling their future ideals through creativity and collaboration technolo-
gies that review the basic axioms.
2.10.2  Community Informatics Design’s Axioms
Christakis and Flanagan (2011), followed by Bausch and Flanagan (2012), remind 
us seven fundamental axioms related to social systems design in the context of wide 
users/designers’ communities take over open-source code software during the third 
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

71
phase of science’s emergence. We add several semiformal great axioms, some 
inspired by Abraham Moles’ works (Moles and Rohmer 1986, 1998; Moles 1990; 
Moles and Jacobus 1988) and some others come from our recent works performed 
within the framework of our research under the APSI program’s aegis.
Let us quickly remind ourselves the definition of the axiom. In philosophy, the 
Petit Robert tells us it is an “indemonstrable truth, but obvious to anyone who 
understands its meaning”. It is a great hypothesis that common sense can admit, 
provided that the proposition that articulates it be clear. It is an intellectually obvi-
ous statement from which we draw logical consequences towards the elaboration of 
a system (here, the FOSM system is applied to the creation of community informat-
ics design’s science). For example, we could say that “people have different ways to 
appropriate the Internet and the collaborative tools according to their cultural affili-
ation”, or even that “the current social Web progression and the ethics drift it creates 
need the development of values and norms aiming to guide its evolution and its 
design”. These general beliefs are encoded in the form of a proposition or a state-
ment postulating a relation/link between two entities, components or concepts. 
They serve as a guide for the action, in particular in the search for links between 
transdisciplinary concepts within an instantiation strategy of several fields related to 
the establishment of a socio-technical system.
Within the context of our research, we could adopt the following work definition: 
“a socio-technical axiom combines social and technical elements to account for 
various hypotheses potentially generalizable concerning individual behavior 
towards ICT, collaboration between social networking groups, evolution of virtual 
organizations and DSS design, assistance virtual environments for collaborative 
design and creativity tools that support and accompany them”. An axiom generally 
possesses the type structure “A is related to B”. A and B can be any entity or com-
ponent and the entities can be causal or correlational. For example, the statement 
“the well-designed sites are developed by people with the right digital skills” pres-
ents the characteristic structure of an axiom.
The values are different, because they have the following form: “A is desirable or 
right for the citizen. A is a value or an objective”. In fact, several researchers see 
values like evaluative beliefs. When an evaluative belief becomes more specific 
(such as validated in part, either empirically through documentation or other means), 
it becomes an axiom. For example, statements such as “social system design is 
good”, or even “community informatics design is good for the education system”, 
are evaluative propositions we would classify among values instead of axioms. 
However, if we say that “social system design is good and has become necessary to 
meet the challenges of our civilization”, or even that “community informatics design 
will produce competent and winning students in the knowledge society”, we make 
them axioms, because these statements suggest a relation and concrete interactions 
between two entities.
Let us start by presenting the seven axioms favouring the emergence of the third 
phase of science such as community informatics design, as suggested by Zeeuw 
(1996, 1997) and supported by Warfield (1986), Christakis (1987, 2007, 2010), 
Banathy and Jenlink (2005), Banathy (1996), Laszlo (1972), Laszlo and Laszlo

(2007, 2004), Laszlo et  al. (2002, 2010), Laszlo (2001), Laszlo et  al. (2002), 
Checkland (1981, 1976), Checkland and Holwell (1998), Checkland and Scholes

(1982, 1993a), Schön (1983), Christakis and Bausch (2006), Flanagan and Bausch 
(2011) and Flanagan and Christakis (2010) and several other great researchers (with 
our socio-technical framework adaptations).
	 1.	 The complexity axiom: Social systems design is a multidimensional challenge. 
It requires an observational variety to be respected when two stakeholders or 
observers take part in a dialogue while ensuring their cognitive limitations are 
not at odds with our efforts aiming to improve understanding (Warfield 1986; 
Warfield and Christakis 1987).
	 2.	 The commitment axiom: Social systems design like healthcare, education, smart 
cities and virtual community or inter-enterprise collaborative networks, without 
the authentic commitment of stakeholders, the establishment of projects is 
impossible (Özbekhan 1970, with adaptation).
	 3.	 The investment axiom: All stakeholders are involved if the collaborative design 
of their own social system must make their own investment in trust and faith-
fully commit in order to be ready to discover a mutual understanding and col-
laborative solutions (Flanagan et al. 2012; Flanagan and Bausch 2011; Flanagan 
and Christakis 2010).
	 4.	 The logical axiom: The appreciation of distinctions and complementarities 
through one inductive, deductive, “abductive” and “retroductive” logic is essen-
tial for the future creative comprehension of the human being. The abductive 
logic leads us to imagine new systems, and the retroductive logic makes “imag-
ination leaps” to the extent that it is capable to stock up on values and emotions 
in research and development, within the diversity of stakeholders (Romm 1996, 
2002, 2006).
	 5.	 The epistemological axiom: An exhaustive science around the human being 
should perform its researches from the human life in the totality of its thoughts, 
its desires and its feelings, like the indigenous people of Australia, the Athenians, 
are able to do. It should not be dominated by the Western epistemology which 
reduces science to intellectual dimensions (Harris and Wasilewski 2004).
	 6.	 The border transgression axiom: A community informatics design science 
engages stakeholders into action beyond geographical, cognitive and cultural 
borders in order to create symbiotic social systems that allow people of all 
social backgrounds to have a discussion beyond all borders, cultural, religious, 
racial or professional barriers, as components of a mutual enrichment of their 
way of perceiving, feeling and acting (Christakis 1993; Romm 2006, 2002, 
1996).
	 7.	 The power conciliation axiom: The social systems’ community informatics 
design seeks to reconcile individual and institutional power relations that are 
persistent and inherent to any stakeholders’ group according to their own pre-
occupations while honouring the required distinctions and perspective variety 
that occur in the action arena (Jones 2010).
2  Universal Anteriorities and Third-Phase Science

73
	 8.	 The self-organization axiom: In the technological society, individuals and com-
munities become able to self-organize by configuring, making, adapting, put-
ting to service and mastering any technical device regardless of its complexity 
level. In other words, complexity is not an obstacle or an objection anymore to 
the creation of any collaborative technical device. The creation of transdisci-
plinary teams where members master the open-source code contributes to cre-
ating more and more complex digital social systems that are highly reliable 
(Moles and Rohmer 1986, 1998; Moles 1990; Moles and Jacobus 1988; with 
our adaptation).
	 9.	 The dispersal axiom: Society in its whole possesses the will and the capacity to 
make available open-source code devices to publics and users who are prodi-
giously spread out demographically and geographically, to the extent that these 
publics feel a propensity to communicate and a “communicativity” strong 
enough to create a critical mass of users or an intense enthusiasm to justify a 
technically commercial effort supported by an innovation digital social system 
(Moles and Rohmer 1986).
	10.	 The proxemics axiom: The society of communicational opulence has been 
breaking the proxemics law for a long time (Hall 1962; Hall and Hall 1969; 
Hall et al. 1984), and according to which, historically, human relations have 
been built on a spectre of close sequence, meaning, that relations between indi-
viduals, groups and communities obey to a general evolution diagram where 
human beings influence each other more if they are closer in time and space. In 
this context, each action sequence determines more or less the following one. 
This law is disputed in its generality by the current progression of the social 
Web. The current social systems are not exclusively developed from relations 
between neighbour elements but also between elements that are geographically 
and socio-demographically distant. This situation gives rise to a new factor of 
socio-economic development based on new action and interaction forms that 
future social systems design must collectively support and orientate. ( Moles 
and Rohmer 1986, 1998; Moles 1990; Moles and Jacobus 1988; Harvey 2003, 
2004a, 2005, 2008; Harvey and Bertrand 2004).
	11.	 The digitization/personalization axiom: It is possible to do more with smaller 
work modules and collaborative devices capable of personalizing and manipu-
lating all sorts of knowledge at the speed of light. The current living labs and 
colabs have made this factor their modus operandi on the scale of several coun-
tries. In Quebec, the CEFRIO studies echo it largely. This possibility has dra-
matically increased the human capacity to massively implant algorithms 
formerly reserved to experts and that now distorts the world of objects, applica-
tions and services like online social systems implantation. This factor is cur-
rently exploding the exploratory design space (e.g. the number of options of 
available devices for the civil society and of creativity tools with open-source 
code supporting them). This axiom, well documented by our questionnaires 
and our case studies, shows that all sorts of groups, communities and organiza-
tions in Quebec are facing new ways of innovating that are reaching not only 
expert but also citizens in their everyday lives. New forms of social life and 
2.10  Community Informatics Design Science: A Specific Vision According…

74
social systems are born and command fulfilment criteria and norms we are not 
very familiar with (Harvey 2003, 2004b, 2005, 2008; Harvey and Bertrand 
2004).
	12.	 Social systems’ design skill axiom: DSS are not only the mirror of already exist-
ing institutions and organizations. Brand new forms of social systems and vir-
tual organizations are born from these new modules and devices, through global 
time and space at a pace never seen before. Never in the history of humanity 
were so many citizens able to learn so much from each other, to answer every-
one from such great distances and to give advice on solving a problem through 
transborder knowledge. The traditional library or the university one is more and 
disputed in their roles of exclusive producer and keeper of the human knowl-
edge. The metaphor of the Universal Encyclopaedia is more and more replaced 
by social systems of living and self-learning appropriation of knowledge and by 
multi-user designers’ networks and content producers (participative sciences 
are eloquent current examples). In this context, institutions in the field of edu-
cation must reflect on their roles in the information society. They must face 
“new digital literacy” that largely exceeds the appropriation of tools and the 
content production that questions their roles by taking over collective skills in 
design at the service of the innovation’s ubiquitous imagination (Harvey 2003, 
2008).
	13.	 The equity of technology’s access and information democratization axiom: This 
axiom is no longer a priority dimension in the Western world. With the social 
Web and collaborative platform generalization, these are replaced by the equity 
of new digital skills to be acquired in design. These skills must become basic 
tools in a knowledge society where ethics are maltreated and where threats of 
control over our lives are becoming greater. The progressive ICT infiltration 
progressive in all human activity spheres and the threat of “gadgetization” of 
everyday life by social media call for a radical turnaround of the present social 
informatization period where, from a global influence of technology on culture, 
we must put the human and the culture at the centre of human development: the 
citizen in the driver seat. The major design task of the upcoming decades is to 
become a “design centred on humans” and not only on the users (Harvey 2008, 
2013).
	14.	 The globalization design axiom: This axiom becomes the corollary of freedom, 
prosperity and innovation, while an increasing number of people become 
engaged in multimodal processes, like our evaluation questionnaire of design 
practices reveals (see annex for the APSI report on our website). These prac-
tices go from content production to new online social systems forms with all 
sorts of productions and innovations previously unseen at the time of mass 
media. This generalized social Web development has virtually replaced the 
ideal of the solitary discoverer or the inventive genius who works from the bot-
tom of his laboratory. This ideal gives way to mass users who in the networks 
and large-scale social systems create practice communities of passionate peo-
ple who take charge of the unprecedented activities through new forms of com-
munication action. They prepare the Internet of the future. In the design society,

a brand new economy is seeking innovative models. Programming or being 
programmed, making design or having our own social systems design made – 
such are the maxims of autonomy, democratic participation and the necessity to 
favour the generalized appropriation of digital skills in the design of the future. 
The present book wishes to offer the outlines, the legitimacy of the spreading of 
this fundamental cultural attitude by showing some directions to designers, by 
giving some suggestions to people in the education field and by suggesting 
concrete orientations to granting organizations. In the information society, 
designers can no longer master all aspects of the design and the innovative 
aspects of research alone. They must become socio-technical facilitators, expert 
guides able to work within delocalized transdisciplinary teams at the service of 
socio-economic development and massive innovation (Harvey 2003, 2004a, 
2005, 2008; Harvey and Bertrand 2004).

Community Informatics Design’s Theoretical 
Basis
3.1  Theories and Principles Related to the Corpus (Block 2)
After having presented the foundations of science in the previous chapter, we will 
now succinctly present a few theoretical general bases that help understand funda-
mental community informatics design orientations as a socio-technical science. A 
typology of principles that underlies this type of design will also be exposed as well 
as a certain number of laws supporting its development. Our objective is to suggest 
a synthesis from Warfield (1986) and other theoreticians’ model. Several other mod-
els will be presented in the following chapters.
This presentation of community informatics design’s aspects related to the “the-
ory and corpus” block aims to extract the general framework of a perspective of a 
socio-technical design anchored in solid traditions of a society of participative, col-
laborative, sustainable and responsible information, similar to the Scandinavian 
participative design. Our approach is normative because it encourages a particular 
information society, very much in line with the values supported by both world 
The proper study of mankind is the science of design. 
Herbert Simon (2005)
Our future will be above all a design matter.  
Vilém Flusser
Taking the premise of second-order cybernetics seriously and 
applying the axioms of human centeredness to designers and 
users alike calls on designers to conceive of their job not as 
designing particular products, but to design affordances for 
users to engage in the interfaces that are meaningful to them, 
the very interfaces that constitute these users’ conceptions of an 
artifact, for example of a chair, a building or a place of work. 
Taking, moreover, seriously the above-mentioned experiences 
that different people may bring a diversity of meanings to a 
design, meanings that are especially different from how 
designers conceptualize their designs, calls on designers to 
apply considerable cultural sensitivity to different users’ 
epistemologies. Designers who intend to design something that 
has the potential of being meaningful to others need to 
understand how others conceptualize their world – at least in 
the dimensions that are relevant to their design.

summits on information society held in Geneva in 2003 and in Tunis in 2005. This 
information society includes qualities that are desirable for a group of countries, 
fields and professions on matters relating to management and knowledge sharing.
The community informatics designer’s task consists of developing and anchoring 
in the foundations of a “science of communicational design socially responsible”, 
previously presented, a certain number of principles, theories and concepts that 
help build community information systems and then aligning them on democratic 
principles of participation, collaboration, coordination and fair networking gover-
nance and sustainability that become major notions related to the information soci-
ety concept. Our approach incorporates the general social science theories, design 
thinking and socio-technical approaches related to “Internet research”, like the com-
puter-mediatized communication and other activities from the sectors of science, 
technology and society (STS). Let us closely examine the works of our research 
group from the Applied Community Informatics Lab (ACIL) at UQAM and the 
characteristics of our approach.
Community informatics design (or socio-digital media design) is an intervention 
and support strategy that presents itself like an evolutive orientation model of social 
media and collaborative platforms, operating a change of significant paradigm for 
the acquisition of skills in the world of information and communications. It tran-
scends individual communication theories and traditional mass media culture by 
proposing a cooperative vision of human activity and a pragmatic orientation mode 
belonging today to the “computer-mediatized social participation” movement 
(Fischer 2013b; Shneiderman and Fischer 2011) and to the interactive design 
(Preece and Maloney-Krichmar 2005; Preece et al. 2004) supporting it. As a strat-
egy, community informatics design represents a specific ICT integration mode 
(social media and collaborative devices) to organizations, digital social systems and 
to virtual communities’ activities. As a practice, it supports the co-construction of 
reasoning spaces associated with conceptual design (the design space), to network 
knowledge management and the co-design of virtual environments currently multi-
plying in cyberspace: virtual campus, corporate universities, virtual organizations, 
Web-mediatized work groups, institutions portals, fun spaces and multiplayer 
games. Finally, it initiates an emerging, sociocultural and communication process of 
production of new social forms and social networks of the Web within which users 
value cooperation, responsible citizen commitment, knowledge sharing and the 
accumulation of information capital dedicated to social change. Figure 3.1 repre-
sents successive skill levels currently evolving in the social system. At the first level, 
we find the mass of users who possess different degrees of design skills with diversi-
fied uses. We illustrate these design uses by increasing order of specific skills at 
various levels. The sixth and last levels characterize the community informatics 
designer of large-scale socio-technical systems. Inspired by the works of Gerhard 
Fischer, this simplified model of the mediatized social evolution by socio-digital 
technologies accompanied us in the construction of our analysis tools (question-
naires, case studies) aiming to better understand who the co-design users are, the 
object of their design and their current skills level.

In the context of the present book, “co-design” extends from collaborative design 
in a partner’s community possessing various types of expertise in different fields of 
practice and research, contributing this way to the development of online social 
systems design, interactive scriptwriting of large-scale sustainable development 
projects and the creation of network collaboration interfaces. This evolution occur-
ring at various levels of society requires new collective skills.
3.2  Towards a Community Informatics Design  
Communication Model
Our research group, working at the UQAM’s ACIL, provides an important research 
effort to develop a new theory of collaborative design of digital social systems (digi-
tal environments) supported by the Web 2.0 and 3.0 social participation platforms: 
community informatics design.
In a world of continuous information and communication flow, the social sys-
tems appear and disappear at a speed never seen before in history. In a context of 
information overload, solving large-scale socio-economic problems and the “digita-
lization” emancipation of human activities, learning in virtual environments and 
knowledge sharing all become survival conditions of our societies. Socio-digital 
media and modern information technologies and digital communications are an 
integral part of our everyday lives, work and our communities. They pose a chal-
lenge to the theories of communication and traditional media. Since 2007, a new 
communication design thinking (Krippendorff 2007; Crilly et al. 2008; Mehlenbacher 
2008, 2009; Storkerson 1997, 2006, 2008; Aakhus 2007, 2010, 2011; De Moor 
2005; De Moor and De Cindio 2007) proves to be one of the strongest trends of the 
international theoretical and practical development regarding innovation and the 
necessity to develop more responsible social systems.

First, by resorting to the rich traditions of participative design – direct user and 
expert facilitators’ commitment – we will see that community informatics design is 
gaining prominence as a rhetorical paradigm anchored in the socially responsible 
communication, collaboration and cognition design notions. Second, community 
informatics design matures as a collective dialogue that formulates three essential 
propositions for communication and socio-technical reflection on the under construc-
tion design: ethic, systemic and pragmatic. Finally, examples of conceptual and 
applicative integration in various fields of expertise, especially practice healthcare 
communities, online multi-gamer communities and network animation learning 
communities, will help serve as illustrations in the section dedicated to applications.
3.3  Understand, Validate and Support Collaborative 
Cultures
Since antiquity, world cultures have defined themselves largely by their media and 
their communication tools integrated with their way of thinking, working, learning 
and collaborating. In the last decades, most media design has adopted a linear con-
ception that was making a very clear distinction between producers and consumers, 
between designers and users (Harvey 1995; Benkler 2006). Radio, books, records 
and, especially, cinema and television illustrate this orientation that has been anal-
ysed in our communication departments as the couch potato phenomenon. During 
several decades, for the vast majority of mass-media “couch potato” viewers, the 
remote control has represented the most important device of cerebral and behav-
ioural activity. This situation does not refer to a real democracy of users in the sense 
that we understand it today in the field of “Design Thinking” and “Open Innovation” 
where users of social media are also producers of the applications or program (the 
idea of “producers”). Likewise, for over a century, public relations systems cultivate 
a certain type of approach the “hypodermic bite” (Balles) to socialize enterprise’s 
and organization’s activities just like our mass education systems have favoured 
behavioural approaches considering the learners as “knowledge consumers” instead 
of knowledge producers and creators capable of generating socio-economic innova-
tion. Governments have also transformed the citizen into a “beneficiary” instead of 
an actor able to resolve problems and orientate social systems of the future. All 
these approaches harm the sustainable development of our societies and taint a cul-
ture of “chronic passivity” that stays with them forever. The results can be disas-
trous regarding motivating people to actively participate in their society and 
transforming their way of life, to become entrepreneurs and innovators. Students, 
workers and citizens are often kept aside of decision-making mechanisms, the polit-
ical class or education systems: instead of developing their skills in terms of auton-
omy, recreation of our social systems and active roles in the socio-economic 
evolution, we cultivate their aptitude to criticize and beg for services.
The recent expansion of the social Web and social media ecosystem has gener-
ated several practical and spectacular outcome of the works relying on a scientific

movement started 30 years ago in the field of “Social Computing” (Kling 1973), and 
about 15 years ago with the development of “Community Informatics” (Harvey 
2008 and Gurstein 2003), that is now facilitating the emergence of a “participative 
culture” paradigm for-co-design (Fischer 2011; Jenkins 2009; Preece and 
Shneiderman 2009) and a massive and historical “Citizen Science”. This participa-
tive culture, whose lack of conceptual foundations or enthusiasm has been deplored, 
proposes no less than a deep change of the passive consumer culture to an active 
citizen committed culture (Etzioni 2009). We progressively go from one culture 
where artefacts and devices are industrially made to a participative culture (Jenkins 
2009) of large-scale handiwork where individuals, groups and communities volun-
tarily contribute to the evolutive process of social information and massively col-
laborate to solving large-scale problems. These developments that may create 
all sorts of ethical, political and strategic problems represent no less than one of 
the perspectives of priority socio-economic development for Quebec, Canada and 
the world.
The world is changing and technological means are also transforming them-
selves. Recent developments of social media, ubiquitous computing, collaborative 
platforms and cloud computing arouse occasions we must seize within the frame-
work of national innovation strategies. Quebec and Canada must put in place a 
cutting-edge research for mediatized collaboration systems design through informa-
tion technologies and communication (DeSygnCoMéTIC). We must lead researches 
of national and international scale on socio-technical design approaches (combining 
social and technological systems) and a computing approach more centred on the 
human and society. As we evolve towards participative social and virtual worlds that 
free us from traditional worlds where only a small number of experts were defining 
politics, designing systems and rules and creating work artefacts, an entire field of 
new perspectives and large-scale challenges are opening to us: large projects of 
production and knowledge sharing of the twenty-first century in action and socio-­
economic innovation communities.
Our research program explores theoretical and practical foundations of collabo-
ration and co-creation of systems and online social networks in order to understand, 
value and support participative cultures emerging in the Internet virtual communi-
ties. Our basic hypothesis consists of saying that new Web collaborative platforms 
facilitate socio-economic innovation, while recognizing it is far from being suffi-
cient. The participative culture we find in virtual communities and in emerging 
social systems of the social Web, such as virtual campus, corporative universities, 
militant communities, living labs, colabs and online learning environments, are 
socio-technical systems since their development does not rely only on technology. 
They contain two types of process: technological systems that provide the possibili-
ties of desirable and reliable interactions between users’ systems and social systems 
(Luhmann 1989, 1995; Giddens 1984; Habermas 1984; Banathy 1996; Fuchs 2004, 
2008) that are dynamic, emerging, contingent and transitory in their interactions 
that are socio-technical entities, socio-constructive subjects and evolutive objects. 
All these types of social Web emerging systems are the results of transformations in 
the groups, the communities and behaviours observed in the social organization 
where contributors (Preece and Shneiderman 2009) actively commit, at various 
3.3  Understand, Validate and Support Collaborative Cultures

82
­levels, in the production of content and design of massive innovation, dynamic ICT 
appropriation (Harvey 2004a), the reconfiguration of technologies to their specific 
needs and the collaborative construction of knowledge.
Our analytical and conceptual framework relies on a large diversity of applica-
tion contexts such as the co-creation of an open-source code software, support tech-
nologies for collaborative computer-assisted work (TCAO), multiplatform creation, 
community informatics environments (Harvey and Lemire 2001), community facil-
itation and hypermedia facilitation in media design, urban planning and project 
management, distance education and community informatics, sustainable develop-
ment and communication for responsible development, meta-design, participative 
and collaborative design as well as the socio-construction of virtual worlds (Lemire 
2008). These different analysis and design perspectives, which we will define fur-
ther along in terms of research axis (Sect. 2.5), allow us to jointly articulate guide-
lines for human collective design and non-human (Latour 2008), as well as to 
articulate and incorporate multiple perspectives capable of guiding socio-technical 
platform design and especially to explore the conceptual framework capable of ori-
entating the action into social computing and community informatics on social and 
organizational participation and collaboration assisted by computers.
3.4  Collaboration Mechanisms: The ACIL’s 8C Approach
It is important to understand how collaborative technologies and platforms of the 
social Web allow the emergence of a participative culture where cognition, coopera-
tion, collaboration, coordination and communication concepts (the first five C) can 
account for important and relevant processes translating a wide diversity of impor-
tant challenges our society is faced with and the way to resolve them, for example:
•	 Large-scale communication problems that force us to reflect on new adaptable 
and evolutive models since the transmitter-receiver interpersonal model repre-
sents only a part of a global context where relations between individuals and 
society must be re-evaluated in terms of action in the world and double contin-
gency between the various actors involved in a specific communication situation 
in complex environments.
•	 Cognitive master problems and the necessity to create methodologies that can 
understand the governance modes at never-seen-before scales, requiring new 
information visualization tools, for example, to visualize all catastrophes and 
threat situations through the world such as the modeling Google Earth, 3D 
Warehouse and Google SketchUp.
•	 Systemic and transdisciplinary problems that require the collaboration of several 
experts from different fields of knowledge, especially the creation of collabora-
tive platforms and virtual environments dedicated to various types of collabora-
tive and participative design of online social systems like the ones developed by 
the ACIL in the context of its My Portal Col@b initiative at UQAM’s faculty of 
communication.
3  Community Informatics Design’s Theoretical Basis

83
•	 Problems of politics orientation and partnership development, in terms of 
research program creation and grants, as well as partnership initiatives able to 
promote massive social innovation and contribute to “support to information 
society transition”, the same name of the program suggested by the Quebec gov-
ernment and its ministry of Services gouvernementaux.
•	 Problems of personalizing collaborative and modeling DSS platforms (like virtual 
communities) in a changing world (Banathy 1996), systems that must rely on 
open architectures like the ones of living labs that are on the rise everywhere 
throughout the world (e.g. get equipped with generic design techniques to create 
data bases and digital libraries in order to answer the particular needs and the 
communicational requirements (Feenberg 2002) of underprivileged communities 
or handicapped people. We will come back to it in the Sect. 3 on methodology).
•	 Problems related to the self-organization of virtual communities, problems that 
are impossible to define well once and for all and requiring levels of social com-
mitment and mobilization because the co-design of social systems we are mostly 
interested in cannot be entrusted to organizations outside the community.
•	 Lifelong learning problems and the creation of distance education platforms 
capable of transgressing not only geographical borders but also the ones related 
to ethnic division, intercultural affiliations and language barriers which are the 
focus of our partners’ work Lionel and Pascal Audant, from UNIMASOFT, who 
have created a new language for distance learning within the global interconnec-
tivity: learning through hypermedia animation supported by community net-
working (mentioned in Chap. 5). We also continue important work in partnership 
with the native Wemotaci community in the fields of learning communities, Web 
radio and sustainable development with Guy Gendron, a member of the ACIL 
and a PhD student at UQAM, as well as with Yves Lusignan, engineer, pioneer 
of complex systems and technical functional modeling applied to sustainable 
development. As well as several professor researchers of the UQAM’s faculty of 
communication who have joined our efforts to develop a model for a collabora-
tive platform, a type of social architecture tool kit for the community informatics 
design (SADC).
Today, the development of what we now identify as a “circular” or a “sharing 
economy” or better, as a “Fourth Industrial Revolution”, is based on a “collaborative 
culture” supported by a vast diversity of products, applications and services: social 
media and networks, design tools, creativity devices, digital environments for learn-
ing, MOOCs and digital object libraries, information democratization tools, learn-
ing analytics, socio-technical co-creation methodologies, business platforms and 
open innovation in living labs. Many of these generic digital design environments 
are oriented by different fields of knowledge and assessment, allowing human and 
social sciences to progressively take part in the construction of new living and work-
ing environments by promoting the creativity “of all for all”. Knowledge sharing 
and the increase of collaboration capacities within the new users’ practice commu-
nities are progressively becoming contributors (Preece and Shneiderman 2009). 
These users’ communities allow the accelerated democratization of design and 
socio-economic innovation by placing the creators’ power (engineers, artists, 
3.4  Collaboration Mechanisms: The ACIL’s…

84
­multimedia designer, computer graphic designer, experts, architects) in the hands of 
widen users’ communities. These communities transform themselves into active 
innovation actors, the “prosumers” (Harvey 2009) of the online social systems 
design. New social systems (networking work groups, practice communities, virtual 
organizations, new institutions, economically innovative partnerships, cyber-physi-
cal social systems) are created each day to co-build products or create events, plan 
projects and draw a new platform, all that in real time, without any distinction of 
distance or borders. Thousands of websites and portals can currently testify the 
accelerated increase of this mass creativity movement. Hundreds of new environ-
ments are created each day by different participation and collaboration cultures.
One of the fundamental challenges of the living labs and the colabs dedicated to 
innovation, like the UQAM’s ACIL and My Portal Col@b, is to catalyse and capture 
the incredible creative of collaborative cultures. A second challenge consists of con-
ceptualized virtual environments, to make the design and to make these environ-
ments evolve. In addition to technically promote and increase the creative capacities 
of users’ communities, they will also systematically favour the members’ commit-
ment and the good collective governance of these new cyber-infrastructures. 
Collaboration is often influenced by individual efforts in the use of tools and by the 
validation of other users’ contribution. This effort of digital literacy and common 
production can be considerably reduced by providing the right tool and methodol-
ogy at the best moment and location by enticing people to participate in the social 
innovation efforts through collective force and by favouring the best alignment (fit) 
for the users’ needs, their vision of the future and their skills in the innovation con-
text. This alignment idea is extremely important in the organizational design theo-
ries, because they seek to show that beyond literacy, interested in media writing 
(Cartier 2011), we must insist on the capacity of self-creation of communities in 
regard to a specific communicational intention (teleology). One of the UQAM’s My 
Portal Col@b priority objective is to align (adapt) collective aspirations of groups 
according to functionalities and collaborative tools that accompany and individual 
and collective skills that help updating them. These skills will have to attract the 
explicit attention of all involved actors in the socio-economic development, because 
in the knowledge economy, a real skill in participative culture is not only a social 
life and leisure one but a collaborative skill oriented towards social innovation. 
Since all individual efforts can greatly vary from one person or organization to 
another, we must now tackle the co-design (collaborative design) of educational and 
training programs within innovative partnerships.
The Northern Plan, announced in Quebec in May 2011, almost abandoned in 
2013, could greatly benefit from this participative culture and virtual organization, 
provided we can build responsible ecosystems where we will be able to better define 
the roles of each actor and the necessary skills according to our socio-economic 
development objectives. This coordination skill and collective efforts is what is 
lacking today in Quebec, Canada and in the Western world. After two decades of 
individualism, how to convert the incredible energy and participative culture into a 
socio-economic emancipation force and sustainable development?
3  Community Informatics Design’s Theoretical Basis

85
The history of media teaches us that for millennia, the biggest cultural changes 
coincide with the birth of new media and new knowledge production devices. One 
of the questions raised by history regarding the current world participative cultures 
consists of trying to analyse if the current growth of virtual worlds and meta-­
universe will disrupt human activities like reading, writing and reprography have 
done in their day (Cloutier 2001). Will the power of the collective brain (symbiotic 
man, planetary brain, distributed cognition, collective intelligence and community 
informatics ubiquitous imagination) favour the emergence of a planetary conscience 
of urgent problems humanity is currently facing and the discovery of solutions that 
save the specie? Or shall we expect still unknown adverse effects like global com-
puter crashes, a decline of civilization and cultural disadvantages such as the ones 
currently condemned by several communication specialists, heirs of Socrates, 
Baudrillard or Derrida? Are we deconstructing the world or rebuilding it as a mirror 
in cyberspace without a good knowledge of global issues, advantages and disadvan-
tages of these new media and technologies for our future? Can we identify the major 
validation effects of information technologies and communication and try to reduce 
their negative effects? Which security issues will we be facing within the next few 
years?
3.5  The Various Aspects of a Theoretical Framework 
and Our Lines of Research
All these questions surrounding social media and the current collaborative culture 
can be thrilling, but it must not eclipse a fundamental phenomenon: the evaluation 
of various ways of dealing with numerous difficult and urgent problems. Through 
these ways, the appropriation of new media and the co-building of virtual environ-
ment for collaborative design and social systems can create winning economies for 
the future.
In this section, we will describe several concepts as well as research lines that are 
related to our theoretical and methodological emerging framework. This conceptual 
effort is culminating in a research program relying on 15 years of work supporting 
the creation of remarkable progress in the fields of communication and information 
sciences, the STS sector, information systems, community informatics, meta-design 
and design oriented on communities, programming-oriented aspects and commu-
nity informatics design as well as the socio-construction of virtual worlds. All these 
fields and approaches contributed to recognize the fundamental role of ICT within 
and information society (or communications, a knowledge community, etc.). 
However, we can only note the current theoretical poverty that accompanies the 
popular doxa surrounding social media. Already well-established fields, like social 
computing and other newer ones like Internet research, citizen research and new 
media study, have produced an important historical documentation on information 
society theory (Brier 2000, 2008, 2013; Hofkirchner and Fuchs 2008, 2003) that 
provide us with several analytical frameworks and a wide diversity of approaches. 
3.5  The Various Aspects of a Theoretical Framework and Our Lines of Research

86
The objective of the present book is to develop the beginnings of a taxonomy and 
the definition of these approaches that would help, on one hand, to recognize 
­challenges, weaknesses and perspectives of the current social media approach and, 
on the other hand, to contribute to the elaboration of substantial thinking lines and 
essential points of view. In short, a conceptual reference framework is on the rise. 
Before defining the most important terms of our research program and its develop-
ment lines, we think it is useful to succinctly present the reference framework we 
have built for the beginning of the APSI research.
Figure 3.2 allows to visualize a part of the starting conceptual framework used 
for the APSI research. On the top right are the philosophical foundations of our 
approach. If the FOSM showed the process of the new science, this image illustrates 
some of its content. The spherical image shows the disciplines that intervene in the 
co-creation of virtual environments called “digital social systems”, especially inno-
vation communities. At the centre are the objectives related to collective intelli-
gence and to the needs of social creativity. At the top of the sphere, we find the needs

of the ACIL’s 8C approach: cognition, communication and cooperation. On each 
side of the sphere, we try to give a clear picture of the confrontation and comple-
mentarity between cognitive points of view, between holism and reductionism or 
between the fields of psychology and social and communication sciences. We redis-
cover several of these concepts in various chapters of the book, and we will define 
the terms within the framework of various co-design processes like instantiation of 
innovation communities considered like digital social systems.
3.6  The Community Informatics Design Program: 
Methodologies (Block 3) and Applications (Block 4)
Our funding request for the APSI program (under the ministère des Services gouver-
nementaux) was aiming to elaborate a research program on the collaborative Web 
spreading over several years (from 2010 to 2016). We were coveting the integration 
of human, organizational and technological perspectives by means of collaborative 
design models. The significant challenge of this program was to facilitate the access 
of social media for the citizens by facilitating the co-construction of platforms 
through computer-mediatized cooperation and collaboration within co-designer 
communities by means of collaborative devices and community tools we can 
describe like community and organizational information software systems (Harvey 
and Lemire 2001). We were aiming the progressive elaboration, through analytical 
extensions and successive application “collaboration’s heuristic” and a co-design 
platform capable to serve several fields.
While user graphic interface’s design is accompanied by several design tools and 
individual creation software suites, it is largely renowned that few interfaces or 
technological integrated and universal platforms exist to facilitate information shar-
ing, design cooperation (co-design) and social sciences and information and com-
munication sciences co-creation. Most existing tools lack conviviality or are not 
equipped with work modules necessary for design and networking co-creation. The 
existing CAD (computer-aided design) systems and other types of design assistance 
platforms (e.g. AUTODESK) traditionally help engineers, architects and computer 
and experts in their creative tasks. Similarly, is it possible to create different CAD 
platforms for social system design? It is becoming obvious that community infor-
matics and socio-technical designers need support for the collaboration of innova-
tion project’s development in the short and long term with partners contributing to 
the production and integration of new knowledge from various disciplines. This 
way, they can improve meta-design (design for designers) and community informat-
ics design while developing diverse interactive applications. Therefore, the project 
and efforts suggested in our future program seek to build a flexible and modular 
infrastructure, a cyber infrastructure supported by a digital knowledge library, col-
laborative devices and cooperation evaluation tools between creators of community 
informatics design interfaces and devices.

3.6.1  The Applications (Block 4)
The present project and our general objectives seek the creation of a large collabora-
tive and sustainable development research centre with the mission of training young 
people about community informatics design, at different levels of the education 
system. The objectives of the research centre are the following:
	(a)	 Build a research and development infrastructure aiming to explore the potential 
and application of community informatics design and complex social modeling 
systems as a reference framework allowing to face fundamental challenges 
related to the creation of community informatics and collaborative platforms 
supporting the research-creation communication sciences, in social sciences 
and in Arts and letters.
	(b)	 Create the best possible alignment between support software systems dedicated 
to social systems design, the Réseau d’informations scientifiques du Québec 
(RISQ) platform, the high-performance calculus national Canadian platform 
and the e-learning systems, serious multi-user online games, problems, fields 
and communities of users in constant evolution which requires the use of large-­
scale collaborative platforms.
	(c)	 Define scientific, transdisciplinary and methodological foundations of applied 
sciences in the cyber collaboration with the objective to create design platforms 
and collaborative software systems as socio-technical environments (Moodle 
portal and its social learning environments at UQAM). They mobilize users like 
responsible and “owners of problems” that involve them actively and collabora-
tively in a perspective of continuous development of software tools. The goal is 
to personally and collectively support design and modeling activities that are 
significant and structuring in line with their emerging needs in fields where 
cyber collaboration is important.
3.6.2  The Challenge and the Applied Vision
Over the last decades, most software systems had the objective of optimizing the 
productivity of architectures and the system’s reliability. Incidentally, software 
engineer research has made enormous efforts and has acquired tremendous exper-
tise to meet these goals. However, we are currently entering a new phase of software 
development that, in addition to involving human and social factors, also suggests a 
brand new socio-pragmatic and communication paradigm: from computer codifica-
tion to the participative-ecological-contextual configuration of software tools in 
information and communication sciences through complex partnerships that include 
civil society. In fact, more and more people, beyond the status of content producers 
or software users, also intervene by their design, in a wider optic of improvement of 
life conditions where socio-technical design and software implantation contain 
3  Community Informatics Design’s Theoretical Basis

89
levels of collective commitment never seen before. (Only in the United States, we 
estimated at 13 millions of people who were user designers in 2012).
The current socio-digital media’s collaborative application explosion on the 
Internet and the swift progression of virtual communities of open-source code cre-
ators constitute powerful levers of a participative culture that aims to develop a 
“global expertise of ecosystemic analysis and software creation contextualized by 
social communication”. Existing software development, mainly centred on produc-
tivity in well-defined activities contexts, is insufficient to face the accelerated and 
increasing emergence of use centred on the human, at a large scale. This seeks to 
satisfy the fluctuating needs we meet more and more in the generation of new net-
work participation modes and the acquisition of collective design expertise in the 
extent of open possibilities by massive innovation practice. We need a new class of 
users and participative creation methodologies and collaborative software that does 
not end with implantation phase and deployment but that owe their success to the 
continuous participation of users’ communities (we particularly think about 
Moodle), under penalty of letting the “massive amateurism” expand and the gener-
alization of “anything goes”.
3.6.3  A Research Program Issued from The UQAM’s 
Communication Faculty Aiming to Improve Digital Skills 
in Quebec
The program pursues the development of a reference framework in community 
informatics meta-design in order to guide developers and improve citizens’ digital 
skills in the design of collaborative software systems oriented by the communica-
tional and democratic development context. Supported by professors’ researches 
from social and public communication’s department and few professors from the 
school of media regarding an important documentary study on design theories as 
well as the analysis of exemplary practices and the systematic evaluation of factors 
related to collaborative systems in several fields, our transdisciplinary research pro-
gram started with a partially articulated reference framework called “community 
informatics design” (Harvey 2006b). This reference framework is founded on the 
hypothesis that the design of several collaborative social systems like multi-user 
games, virtual learning communities and social science simulation games can be 
supported by our meta-model in the context of collaborative construction of a com-
munity informatics design’s assistance systems (SADC). The research program 
identifies and correlates technical, social and communicational characteristics 
involved in the design and development of collaborative software systems inviting 
users to collaboratively commit to the design of applications and innovations that 
will help solve their own problems. The noted characteristics (interaction and col-
laborative design methodology patterns in various disciplines) serve as orientation 
parameters to guide the development of the SADC, which is an assistance platform 
3.6  The Community Informatics Design Program: Methodologies (Block 3)…

for the development of software between several partners. A real and virtual devel-
opment co-laboratory is dedicated to the discovery and massive innovation of the 
“synerspace”. The SADC has been built in the Colab (sponsored by UQAM’s ACIL) 
in order to progressively generate the “synerspace” of My Portal Col@b as a cataly-
ser of real users’ efforts committed in the collaborative solving of complex prob-
lems of the social world in several design fields. Our researches have led us towards 
several research lines whose contexts we are presenting in the application below 
(Fig. 3.3).
3.6.4  The Suggested Six Research Lines and Their 
Applications Contexts
Research Line 1: Theory  Transdisciplinarity, social systems design theory and 
community informatics systems’ methodology
The adaptation and development of crossing paths between several different points of view 
constitute the success in the development of human centred interactive systems and its 
numerous contexts of collaborative lives.
3.6.4.1  Description
This transdisciplinary research centre project will contribute to build a new aca-
demic discipline from the consolidation/integration of many disparate works we can 
temporarily group under the terms “applied sciences cyber collaboration” or “com-
munity informatics”, for example, the human-computer interface design, the 
human-computer interaction, the multimedia-interface design and educational mul-
timedia, computer-mediatized communication and collaborative computer-assisted 
work, social media design centred on the user and participative research action, 
social and distributed cognition, digital social systems analysis and collaborative 
cultures. The development of collaborative interactive systems requires the

contribution of several people possessing different professions, playing different 
roles with different objectives and points of view in the development’s life cycle, 
that extend from participative design to knowledge engineering through business 
processes and several types of users.
As the communicational, contextual, emotional and cultural factors gain impor-
tance in the development of interactive and collaborative systems, within organiza-
tions and general affairs, the transdisciplinary, informational and communicational 
knowledge management becomes critical for the evaluations of needs and experi-
ences of users and for the coherent and consistent realization of relevant business 
process and innovative architecture services. We have developed an analysis and 
implantation conceptual framework, the SADC, as a general platform for the inte-
gration of different points of view and activities, the sharing of design resources, the 
monitoring of conceptualization and design conception channels, the development 
of new methods and devices (e.g. communityware and digital objects libraries) and 
the capitalization of community informatics design knowledge. The centre’s 
research program will continue to build and expand the SADC and will create other 
methods and tools to support development in interactive and collaborative systems. 
Like users’ profiles and organizational studies’ contexts, modeling, simulation and 
visualization systems, generation of interactive scripts, communicational evaluation 
of interactive processes, distance collaboration and business processes as well as the 
development of Web service architecture and social systems design is dedicated to 
sustainable development.
3.6.4.2  Application Example
Basic Transdisciplinary Studies on Collaboration
•	 R-D in knowledge management, in a plurality of disciplines, projects, co-­
laboratories and organizations
•	 Development of description and context analysis tools in the development of 
interactive and collaborative uses
•	 Development of planning, design and communicational evaluation methods of 
interactive and collaborative systems
•	 Assistance in the implementation of user/context study programs (like the short 
communication and risk program) in our classes in healthcare and human rela-
tions, the alignment of communicational processes with business processes and 
strategic management of the cyber collaboration through the creation of new 
Web service architectures, scientific communication program, animation and 
cultural researches, marketing and communication/health as well as the new pro-
file of the socio-digital media masters
•	 The massive innovation by social science simulation and its applications in the 
analysis and design of complex social phenomena (pandemic, ecological 
­mobilization, collaborative design of social systems dedicated to sustainable 
development)
3.6  The Community Informatics Design Program: Methodologies (Block 3)…

92
Research Line 2: Methodology  Community informatics design: contextualiza-
tion by communication
The understanding of use by the analysis of communicational processes in place is essential 
to the massive social innovation and design centred on users; social innovation, contents, 
contexts and information and communication devices jointly generate a communicational 
use experience.
3.6.4.3  Description
The appropriation and performance of an information and communication device 
widely depend on the communicational context in which it is used. Activities 
strongly focused on the extensive and expansive knowledge like mobile work, col-
laborative work, distributed learning and the decision-making field contain contexts 
and communicational processes particularly dynamic and complex. Our research 
centre program will propose a communicational theory and a socio-pragmatic meth-
odology and community informatics design that will systematically value and 
incorporate the communicational and transdisciplinary context in the design of 
devices and will allow to manage this context with the aim of enhancing the sys-
tem’s performance in terms of emancipation, human development and added value 
use experience.
The development of embedded technologies and ubiquitous computing requires 
a deep understanding of mediation mechanisms and interaction patterns as well as 
the incorporation of the “communicational context” concept that intervenes in the 
design of interactive and collaborative systems. Our program will develop mixed 
methods (Creswell) to observe, capture, describe, analyse, evaluate, manage and 
accompany the implantation of communicational processes able to intervene and be 
used in the research on community informatics design, interactive systems and col-
laborative environments (micro-, meso- and macrosocial levels). This global 
approach will pave the way for the development of reconfigurable architecture inter-
faces, which will facilitate the personalization and adaptation of interfaces, modules 
and materials to the needs of different projects, their contexts and their respective 
uses. We expose the first elements of our design research methodology in the next 
section dedicated to the methodology of community informatics design.
3.6.4.4  Application Example
•	 Mobile communications and intelligent interfaces in the transport systems
•	 Knowledge management in physical spaces physiques (in person), media and 
information and communication devices (remote)
•	 Learning, social networking, collaborative work and inter-organizational 
environments
3  Community Informatics Design’s Theoretical Basis

93
•	 Large-scale social systems design (cyber democracy, social cyber sciences, 
access and co-creation charts, communication and health co-laboratories, eco-
logical chart grille and economic development)
•	 Methodologies that are relevant to our field can come from social science meth-
ods like ethnography and sociological investigations as well as the ones originat-
ing from fields like human-computer interfaces and information systems. The 
understanding of use and appropriation processes of creativity tools now requires 
mixed research strategies like the ones proposed by Creswell (2008). Table 3.1 
offers an example of mixed methods we have used for the APSI research and 
their dynamic articulation (Table 3.1).

Network and embedded technologies value the integration of physical spaces and media 
spaces thus creating an unexplored space of support to the design dedicated to new applica-
tions in marketing, business, health and education, cyber-physical social systems and valu-
ing the collaborative creation of new socio-communicational products and services.
3.6.4.5  Description
Physical objects and the material carry a rich information that can excite the imagi-
nation and enrich our experience. This research line seeks to develop socio-­
pragmatic communication conceptual frameworks and co-design and co-creation 
methodologies to develop applications, products and services in open-source code 
according to the paradigm of the collaborative reconfigurable architecture. This 
type of architecture facilitates the implantation of concepts such as “communica-
tional contextualization,” by allowing a system to change its structural and paramet-
ric configurations and to adapt them to the emergent and evolutive users’ needs 
according to new interaction and design patterns in varied use contexts. It also intro-
duces a new dimension in the collaborative systems design where users directly 
commit at various levels to the exploration of interactive methodologies, innovative 
communication processes and the modification of software and material architec-
tures to better adapt to their own needs. It encourages an increased number of users, 
experts and uninitiated, including people with physical or mental handicap, to com-
mit creatively to the co-design tasks, collaborative work, self-organization of learn-
ing activities in physical and media spaces.
3.6.4.6  Applications Example
•	 Interactive learning and serious games for self-learning and acquiring digital 
skills for the co-creation of virtual learning communities.
•	 The experimentation and communication and social science simulation for the 
formulation of theories, the creation of “artificial societies” for the study and 
representation of social interactions and the analysis of social systems represen-
tations, organizations and emerging institutions
•	 The construction of architectures for the development of networked and interac-
tive products, applications in interactive management and collaborative inter-
faces design.
•	 The design of multimedia, reconfigurable and multimodal community informat-
ics interfaces.
Research Line 4: Knowledge Basis  Interactive environments of knowledge 
representation
Collaborative knowledge workers need the right content in the right format at the right time 
and in various locations and materials dynamically answering the evolution of tasks in 
varied contexts according to evolutive needs in continuous transformation. We will explore 
the relation between the location, the time, the information and communication.
3  Community Informatics Design’s Theoretical Basis

95
3.6.4.7  Description
The embedded and networking technologies (e.g. the USB stick), socio-digital 
media and many other types of networked information and communication devices 
promote the delivery of information in every situations, spaces and places where the 
user is located. Working environments of the knowledge workers like interactive 
knowledge management environments, research co-laboratories and digital online 
health and education platforms require efficient information and transmission 
access forms in compliance with contextual and organizational changes. However, 
no standard design process allows to visualize and present the information 
dynamically according to multiple modes. This research line focuses on the 
following perspectives:
	1.	 The fundamental dynamics and communicational processes that intervene in the 
communicational/media design and the information presentation
	2.	 The ways of describing the dynamic visualization of information and interac-
tions with users
	3.	 The situational topology for the space and time presentation and community 
informatics of knowledge and behaviour
	4.	 Boarding knowledge techniques in physical objects and collaborative 
environments
The methods developed in this research line will constitute a practical opera-
tional guide for the ubiquitous computing applications in the fields like learning 
organizations, health practice communities, great sustainable development projects, 
collaborative virtual work environments, home automation, cultural learning exhi-
bitions, cyber learning, virtual interactive museums and collaborative human-­
computer interfaces.
3.6.4.8  Application Example
•	 Informational environments design in various fields
•	 Industrial simulation and collaborative solutions prototyping
•	 Sociocultural and urban animation and computer graphic design innovation
•	 Decision-making support environments
•	 Interface design for product creation and network applications
•	 Knowledge management with the help of digital shared libraries and specialized 
collaborative ontologies
Research Line 5: Applications (Products and Services)  The definition of a new 
socio-economic holonic and fractal paradigm
The integration of the physical world and media spaces is the opportunity to develop, for 
people and communities, products and services with new network innovation paradigms 
containing several actors that make different levels of society intervene and promote trans-
versality as well as hierarchy by disrupting the traditional value chain and the positivist, 
sequential and linear business processes.
3.6  The Community Informatics Design Program: Methodologies (Block 3)…

96
3.6.4.9  Description
We are witnessing an increasing need to ensure the co-creation of products, virtual 
environments and shared documents. More and more, this need knocks down the 
traditional boundaries between the world of information and communication (media 
spaces and collaboration devices) and the one of physical spaces of human experi-
ence and the creation of sustainable manufactures products. With the new mobile 
technologies and the network communication technologies, both spaces were sepa-
rated until now into two distinct universes which tend to merge creating links 
between physical objects, media entities and human experience of creation in vari-
ous socio-economic sectors. According to the orientation of this line, we could 
investigate three emerging issues:
	1.	 The development of new transdisciplinary paradigms and products integrating 
physical and media spaces
	2.	 The incorporation of computing and community informatics functions into phys-
ical products by promoting the integration of organizations’ various life cycles of 
services and knowledge to the users and vice versa
	3.	 Position users through appropriation and network marketing as strategic partners 
and resource persons in the development of products and business models
3.6.4.10  Application Examples
Holonic and fractal design for products manufacturing
•	 The planning and decision-making support environments
•	 Smart home automation development
•	 Interfaces design for the co-creation and co-design of network products
•	 The development of network business models
Research Line 6: Sociocultural Ergonomics (Alignment Between Needs and 
Social Media)  The evaluation of sociocultural and communicational factors in 
interactive and collaborative media systems
Cultures create artefacts; artefacts create culture. Social systems influence the creation of 
technologies; technologies influence the evolution of social systems. Values, beliefs, con-
cepts and interactive and collaborative systems (ICS) performance must be an integral part 
of socio-cultural life cycles and creation cycles of social systems. This is an important chal-
lenge for communication sciences that would like to not only evaluate and analyze interac-
tive and collaborative systems but also contribute to ensure its design and implantation at 
various levels of society in different social change contexts.
3.6.4.11  Description
The understanding of cognitive and sociocultural factors related to users’ communi-
ties and the culture of diverse use has become critical to meet the communication 
requirement needs and psychosocial needs of users of interactive and collaborative

systems. This research line seeks to develop models and methods to evaluate, cap-
ture and represent cultural interaction and communication patterns that intervene in 
the community informatics design and modeling of artefact-human interactions. 
Our first approach will be the socio-pragmatic model of communication and the 
SADC that will integrate multiple points of view in the composition of a “poly-
phonic design” and various layers of training and cultural creation intervening in the 
description and creation mechanisms of collaborative and interactive systems.
3.6.4.12  Application Examples
•	 The construction of serious multiroles electronics and multi-user games
•	 The development of virtual and real social systems’ devices and interfaces
•	 The creation of inter-, multi- and transcultural interfaces
•	 The planning and creation of methods and communication and cultural evalua-
tion charts for application products intended for the international within the glo-
balization of services and sustainable human development
•	 The study and production of guidelines for studies on the user context, appro-
priation mechanisms and cultural and communicational factors that influence 
them
3.6.5  A Call for Action and for Socially Responsible 
Communication Design
Thanks to this research program, we introduce a new knowledge technology applied 
to communicational action that allows the co-creation of social-virtual systems eth-
ics (socio-technological) through community informatics design. It validates the 
users’/designers’ participative culture for the creation of socio-technical systems 
that possesses the “emerging strategic alignment” virtue, taking into account the 
new socio-economic realities of the communication society. At a critical era where 
speed, intensity and complex expansiveness of the Web’s changes constantly 
increase, our emancipation and skills should guide this change instead of being the 
victims or expropriated spectators (“who are distracted to death”, said Porter 
(Norman and Porter 2007; Porter and Kramer 2006]) depending on our capacity of 
giving desirable orientations to changes we all aspire collectively in our communi-
ties and our society. Social sciences and information and communication sciences 
are on the brink of an important paradigm change, the digital communication one at 
the service of evolutive design in society. We believe the acquisition of community 
informatics design and communicational skills can mobilize actors of the Quebec 
society in the exercises of participative and entrepreneurial democracy.
We really wish that, in a near future, all the partners of our current social system 
scan are really convinced of the emancipating powers of the community informatics 
design in the socio-economic development in order to collectively and consciously 
3.6  The Community Informatics Design Program: Methodologies (Block 3)…

orientate the creation of more favourable virtual institutions organizations. Social 
change does not operate only through the government or industry’s critique. In fact 
for some, design and its learning would be limited to certain professions or certain 
sectors of activities like software, engineering or architecture development. We have 
to develop a new design and social learning network culture in the education world. 
Community informatics design focuses only on the remarkable perspectives offered 
by the participative culture and the wealth coming from new forms of production 
and collaborative tool creation to promote desirable social changes. Community 
informatics design is not exclusive to experts; it concerns the entire society.
At the time, sciences like biology created medicine and surgery, physics gave 
birth to engineering and architecture, chemistry promoted pharmacies and its clini-
cal study, sociology produced social work and the research action, just like psychol-
ogy create psychiatry and psychoanalysis, mathematics created computer sciences 
and political science management and governance modes. It is now time to give to 
applied communications and information planning their intelligence technologies 
and their digital social systems design strategies by putting in common our ubiqui-
tous imagination transdisciplinary practices, collective creation large-scale inter-
vention and massive innovation.
If we are serious about the idea of committing more and more to people in the 
massive social innovation culture, we must develop a design culture at all levels of 
the education systems, in the business sector, government and non-government 
organizations as well as in the entire Quebec society. Members of My Portal Col@b 
project believe we must provoke concrete learning opportunities in community 
informatics design to develop the necessary skills for innovation at a time when 
Web technology is infiltrating all sectors of society. The transition to information 
society is not only an observation or Internet critique transition which is very useful 
university tasks. It is also a transition by the application of generic design skills for 
socio-economic innovation, individually and collectively, in various contexts of our 
life, at all levels of society.

Community Informatics Design in Action: 
Towards Operational Ways of Thinking 
in Order to Start a Design Process (Block 3)
4.1  Exploration Through FOSM and the Seven Design 
Spaces
As we have previously seen, the field of science models (FOSM) provides the theo-
retical and practical foundations of a collective operational imagination process 
called community informatics design. It is nothing less than an exploratory voyage 
through several thinking and action modes relying on transdisciplinarity. We will 
now see that these thinking modes are a very concrete way of operationalizing the 
community informatics design thinking by seven thinking modes (Burnette 2009; 
Ranjan 2007) likely to help the uninitiated or social and communication science 
students start a design process. These seven thinking modes constitute an opera-
tional model that can intervene at different stages of the FOSM, a life cycle or a 
design project. Each thinking mode is articulated in several natural or specialized 
languages and takes into account a different aspect of the FOSM (foundations, theo-
ries, methodology or the several applications). Each contains characteristics that 
allow to provide specific information and knowledge appropriate to each of the 
instances, procedures or actions related to the FOSM. Concretely, it means that each 
thinking mode allows to operationalize the different users’/designers’ intentions, 
their behaviours, the norms, the architectures, the role distribution, the resources, 
the management modes, etc. These thinking modes conciliate material thinking 
modes (hard) and software (soft). Let us examine how these thinking modes allow 
to explore “imaginary territories” of an innovation culture suggested by the FOSM.
The design process begins with the collective exploration of the “design space”, 
which resembles the trajectory of explorers searching for an unknown territory, the 
one occupied by an unbuilt ecosystem, innovation community, the specification of a 
product or an application or a service to the partners’ community. The research is led 
within the context of a great motivation from the actors, their desire to understand 
and imagine new knowledge universes with all the curiosity and open mindedness 
necessary for the creation of new ways to act, share and live together.

100
This voyage is also an interior one that does not only take place with cognitive 
representations or mental images of the project but also along a process we call 
“oriented sensualization” through a common intention, context and particular envi-
ronment design. It is made of different stimuli that take turn at the forefront of the 
creator’s mind, containing various sensorimotor sources, captured by the five senses 
as well as by feelings (emotions and intuitions) coming from different languages 
(gestural, non-verbal) with a deep sensitivity for the surrounding environment.
The exploration of the design space is accompanied with a series of perceptual 
and sensitive inputs oriented towards a goal (vague or precise) and that together 
provoke a certain amount of learning integrated with each other. This process con-
stitutes a sort of “complexity radar” and of the unknown, an expression seeking to 
translate the abductive capacities and collective imagination that, once combined 
together, will produce the degree of interest and tendency to the necessary commit-
ment to meet the communities’ objectives. The nature of the community informatics 
design’s thinking instantiates through a plurality of technological tools, creation 
process and thinking modes that evolve through the design process, life cycle or 
design phase in a certain given context/environment.
In the image of the systemic FOSM’s process (Chap. 1) and the seven iterative 
space model of community informatics design (Chap. 6), various thinking modes 
and their respective languages are coiled and iterative, and users/designers are gen-
erally comfortable in the uncertainty and have a great tolerance towards ambiguity. 
This allows them to face the type of exploration and sensualization commanded by 
innovation design, for example, the production of new collaborative open-source 
code modules. For example, in the space of design 1 of the FOSM’s block 3, a prac-
tice community clarifies its intentions; formulates its first objectives; examines the 
architectures, applications and existing modules; and then carries out a high-level 
analysis on the feasibility and potential obstacles. This “vagrant” and systematically 
unstructured exploration is progressing in space 2 towards the establishment of 
more specific analysis and synthesis categories introducing by successive observa-
tion levels (our CAPACITÉS model, presented in this chapter). This process is exe-
cuted by sections of brainstorming, collective imagination collective of more or less 
intuitive solutions and categorization of design activities until a reference frame-
work and a structure of the design space are developed and modeled.
In our case, the seven design spaces that define part of the methodology of our 
FOSM in community informatics design can be increased or decreased according to 
the requirements of a specific project representing an open process. It is a scaffold-
ing we have created following the observation of numerous projects’ life cycles in 
various fields like research action, software engineering, open innovation process 
design and collaborative networks or architecture. The idea is not to confine in the 
creation process and collective imagination in a closed algorithm but to show that 
we can orientate the iterative design space process in a way to guide the communi-
ty’s efforts and to validate them at various stages and mostly to evaluate them. 
Without direction, we go nowhere. With too much direction, we subdue the social 
Internet process which is our dynamic global innovation model.

As we have mentioned in our introduction, UQAM’s ACIL tries to semi-­formalize 
a design process that will be capable of associating and putting together skills usu-
ally found in the creation of infrastructures and software engineering platforms to 
combine them with the flexibility required by uninitiated communities from all 
horizons with needs to meet according to their experience and adaptability found in 
social and communication sciences.
The strict improvisation or spontaneous initiatives give extraordinary results in 
the social Web. But with the exponential increase of spontaneous design practices, 
evolutive and non-expert, research has a certain delay on what makes the success of 
these composite infrastructure initiatives at the basis of digital social systems. This 
formidable complexity can hardly be apprehended without the addition of quite 
complex philosophical and theoretical models, to understand them, model them, 
implant them and mostly, evaluate them. The current open innovation explosion and 
the new collective design modalities at a large scale command this effort. Will this 
be worth it? Only well-led empirical researches accompanying numerous cases of 
implantation will tell us.
We need to see in the semiformal design process an action-guiding process 
instead of a break to creativity and in the open innovation, a conscious process fac-
ing the future like the fluid currents and informational meanders of an action land-
scape (Barker 1968; Moles and Jacobus 1988) in which actors explore together the 
situation, context, design process, possible trajectories, promising scripts, the most 
efficient human activity systems and the human-centred digital social systems. 
Whether it is at a micro level like the work team or at the meso level like the com-
munity organization, or even at the macro level like the networks in the global soci-
ety, the possibilities are identified and the options are explicit, which facilitates the 
collective decision-making.
Our team took an inventory of a good amount of collaborative and analytical 
tools used by the designers from all backgrounds to design and model the commu-
nity information systems that support the digital social systems. These transdisci-
plinary, technological or methodological tools intervene in different stages of the 
project’s life cycle. Their appropriation or adoption depends on the project’s spe-
cific task and activities, the knowledge field and its relevance in various evolution 
phases as well as what the team finds appropriate to include in each one. Accessibility 
is important, but also the acquisition costs, individual and collective design skills in 
content planning, access codes and licenses, programming difficulty levels and the 
capacity of integration, compatibility and systems interoperability. These explora-
tions and sensualization of the design space activities will continue until the moment 
the innovation community is comfortable with all the concepts, until components 
and quantitative and qualitative properties met, until the decision-making deadline 
or until quality concepts have been captured in a creative way by the collective 
imagination of the actors who will then submit them to common exams, evaluations 
and validations.
These exploratory processes are executed according to a series of unique think-
ing patterns that, through each project’s personalized life cycle, evolve towards gen-
erative design patterns supported by various heuristic methodologies such as 
4.1  Exploration Through FOSM and the Seven Design Spaces

102
discovery matrices, a concept we will develop largely in the following chapters. In 
the exploration and interaction patterns proper to each design process, we examine 
relations and links between the roles of each partner according to project objectives, 
functionalities and socio-technologies of a portal in relation to the community needs 
or the management modes and governance according to ethical criteria and different 
stakeholders. Our contribution, in this chapter, consists of showing that at the cur-
rent level of socio-technical project of the collaborative Web, these processes are 
rarely documented even if they help the creative thinking and imagination of new 
systems. Substantial learnings can be obtained by the collective creation of double 
identity matrices that, in a combinatorial of dimensions and properties not always 
quantifiable, help evaluate alternatives and create a sort of incubator for the research 
of interaction and design patterns, thus provoking substantial qualitative leaps for 
the imagination and innovation.
Various thinking modes channelled in dialogue modes used in an explicit or dif-
fuse way in instantiation and discovering relation strategies allow the community to 
go from abstract fields (functionalities, technologies) to very tangible fields in their 
forms and treatment (the configuration of a digital social system). For example, a 
complex co-creation process of a complex social system can emerge from very sim-
ple expressions striped of collaborative social media alignment on an uninitiated 
community needs to evolve towards perfected forms of explicit diagrams and three-­
dimensional exploration matrices. These help to script complex architectures that 
take the abstract social sciences model or neophyte towards concrete diagram 
expressions like the one we are presenting in our chapter on technological, organi-
zational and social architectures.
Numerous decisions are taken throughout these exploration activities. We will 
show further along in this book that they can support highly strategic decisions, 
whether they are technological or with social and cultural dimensions. Successive 
decisions are taken throughout this trajectory, the first strategic ones are followed by 
decisions of a more tactical nature contributing to precise or modify an objective or 
examine in detail a series of problem-solving that makes a starting better aligned 
with the intentions or objectives of the community. However, once the design activ-
ity process is set in motion and enters a collective reflection space, it usually escapes 
the initial design team, and only the consequences are assignable to the designer in 
charge. The final result can be a success or a failure in complex contexts where radi-
cal changes create a loss of control regarding the expected results.
All these explorations remind the designer at all levels of perception, representa-
tion and senses, because the team’s highs and lows, the hesitations and the lack of 
skills, good or bad decisions, the loss of trust or the collaboration difficulties destroy 
each other’s trust. Sometimes, even the conduct and facilitation of a community can 
be a very united work especially if the team members do not benefit from the exter-
nal representation of the project by the team or the designer in charge. In other 
words, if the participants do not have the possibility to access the designers’ imagi-
nation at the basis of the coordination and action committee, the communicational 
action becomes difficult at all stages of a project’s life cycle. The impact of the 
results of a design can be positive or negative, just like a fire can warm up campers,

103
but, if not controlled, it can burn the forest surrounding it. It is the same substance, 
but it can have disastrous consequences if the project’s dimensions are not well 
managed or if no collective or consensual representation emerges. The decisions 
and judgments sometimes result in compositions that offer good development 
options, but other times, these compositions bring the stakeholder to make a bad 
decision. It is preferable to vary the decision-making tools, to consider problems 
from every angle and to reject options that are little relevant before continuing the 
DSS development cycled, the application or the service.
4.1.1  Community Informatics Design and Its Seven Thinking 
and Dialogue Modes
The design thinking, the communicational action and the design activities channel 
different thinking and dialogue modes; each puts to contributions in an appropriate 
project phase. One can be called to the rescue of a task or activity, and the other can 
help make a decision regarding the mobilization of creativity tools. In a design proj-
ect, these thinking modes are not necessarily sequential: we can easily go from one 
thinking mode to another as long as the mind or the collaborative team judges 
appropriate to use it throughout the activities that correspond to the different stages 
of an iterative life cycle or a design process. It is important to point out here that the 
appropriation of these diverse modes of collective creation and imagination applied 
to the FOSM and operationalized through the seven design spaces will allow the 
community informatics design to become an evolutive “doctrine” in a universal 
design science in the process of creation.
We will now examine each of these modes and the way we can assign them to the 
design activity articulation. The description of each mode is accompanied by a short 
development centred on several skills identified to the culture and design profes-
sions as well as on its applications to real-world design situations as the processes 
are “sensualized” and integrated to the collective imagination of new social worlds.
Following Burnette (2009) and Ranjan (2007) with adaptation by us, the seven 
thinking modes are (1) intentional thinking, (2) categorization thinking, (3) analyti-
cal thinking, (4) exploratory thinking, (5) abductive thinking, (6) synthetic thinking 
and (7) reflexive thinking. Each thinking mode contains its own dialogue 
activities.
4.1.1.1  Intentional Thinking
Intentional thinking is a series of operational reflections seeking to manage problem-­
solving, satisfying a need or a desire, for example, the construction of a digital 
social system like a health service. It serves to make a design project’s goals and 
orientations explicit. It can also be inspired by the experience, interest, a “stroke of 
4.1  Exploration Through FOSM and the Seven Design Spaces

104
genius”, the learning of a situation or even the idea of improving collective life. 
These thoughts can be animated by a sense of motivation for the intentional social 
change and documented by a particular philosophy like the improvement of an orga-
nization performance, a cultural intervention strategy or the sustainable develop-
ment in a particular field. In some cases, the motivations, instead of being explicit, 
are more dormant and are really only consciously oriented when users/designers or 
innovation communities have explored them with the reflexive practice thinking 
modes and made them visible and tangible in order to orientate the collective action.
A need’s perception, which is usually motivated by the imagination of a new 
world to build or universe to explore, gives birth to the vague notion of a “commu-
nity informatics design opportunity”, which is cognitively represented or collec-
tively “sensualize” like a “thing it is possible to do” or “a thing that must be 
realized.”. Often, the prerogative of one individual at the beginning, his thoughts 
remain until a form of a dialogue takes shape between actors and a question is 
asked, “what if we could do this differently?”, an affirmation would be made, “we 
can only continue like that!”, a visual expression scribbled would serve as an action 
plan surrounding a motivating question, a 3D drawing would illustrate a change of 
process to be planned, etc. The trigger can be a gesture or a non-verbal expression, 
a wave of the hand, a role play, a choreography, an involved song and a theatre per-
formance showing new roles to adopt and act as a symbolic, metaphorical or iconic 
system. Expressions, communicational action verbs and phrases illustrating various 
modes of dialogue (Judge 1998, 2017) like “propose a vision”, “involve members”, 
“review”, “state a mission ”, “motivate a team”, “establish our beliefs”, “share our 
information”, “open a dialogue”, “set objectives” and “consult its members” are 
examples of discourses susceptible to support this thinking mode. These expres-
sions translate, at the beginning, diverse modes more or less intuitive of a design 
situation perception that progressively improve the understanding of the field where 
the particular dialogue mode or expression can anchor itself. Diverse models and 
dialogues can be put to contributions to explore limits and boundaries of a starting 
design project, boundaries that are not immediately and necessarily obvious at the 
origin but that become so as the discovery and learning relations explore its outlines 
by an appropriate dialogue mode.
4.1.1.2  Categorization Thinking
This type of thinking is used like a heuristic mode to discover and organize various 
specific properties and functionalities of a design project in the context of a particu-
lar design situation. Thinking by categorization serves to identify facts, events, 
objects, structures and infrastructures and relevant and appropriate aspects of a 
given design situation. Brainstorming and classification are key processes that serve 
to structure a design situation throughout the FOSM and the seven spaces life cycle 
by exploring the interactions between a design process foundations, its theories, its 
methodologies and its applications on the ground. The systematic exploration of 
facts and design structures through the discovery matrix methodology allows a 
4  Community Informatics Design in Action: Towards Operational Ways of Thinking…

105
practice community to identify fields like social technologies and their functional-
ities, to relate them to the practice community needs by multiple iterations and suc-
cessive grindings. The clarity of the activities to realize emerges only once the entire 
project structure is discovered (its goals, its stakeholders’ roles, the infrastructures 
and architectures, the evaluation modes).
The identification, definition and classification process of fields with the help of 
the discovery matrix, exploration or strategic alignment allows to structure or model 
various types of facts or structures we already know and to confirm them but also to 
note hidden or intangible facts that until now were escaping the members’ compre-
hension. The collective development of visual structures organized like discovery 
matrices and their translation into 3D dynamic matrices allow teams to spread on 
vast territories to co-criticize and analyse individual works of a designer or collec-
tive works of a collaborative team involved in the project. The consolidation of 
known and unknown zones constitutes one of the most important discoveries of a 
direction in a given design situation or in the future research on the community 
informatics design science according to several feedback loops suggested by the 
FOSM.
These discovery matrix exploration or communication research general method-
ologies take place in the real world, through an instantiation strategy of various 
fields to be modeled. However, they allow a team of experts and users to open to a 
series of constraints like resources access, the identification of appropriate skills in 
a design situation, knowledge appropriation, the availability of necessary budgets 
for the action, the time feasibility as well as infrastructures and social media essen-
tial to the realization of experiences and trials susceptible to help shed light on a 
certain number of questions in the mind of the users/designers. These questions 
appear serious and will be taken into account and will need imperative answers in 
order to ensure the project’s success.
This thinking mode contains a dialogue mode that is articulated around expres-
sions like “assess what the team favours as design facts”; “focus our attention on 
what emotionally resonates with the team”; “lift human, material and financial 
obstacles”; “develop an argumentative line for the project’s funding”; “evaluate sev-
eral replacement scripts”; and “open a dialogue with new stakeholders around prior-
ity issues”, knowing that the establishment of a common program requires the 
knowledge sharing between actors, professions and disciplines. Certain well-­
executed explorations, but useless to an immediate project, will be kept in the digital 
library for a future application or other exploratory, local or delocalized activities.
4.1.1.3  Analytical Thinking
Current creativity tools and collaborative design assistance platforms can contribute 
to the exploratory design if it is possible to organize large quantities of data they 
generate in order to map them in the models. This way, it will help them to reveal, 
in a pragmatic and useful way, new knowledge within the framework of a juxtaposi-
tion and compared analysis process of relations between the aspects and concepts of 
4.1  Exploration Through FOSM and the Seven Design Spaces

106
an issue. Numerous analysis tools can be adopted and adapted by a community to 
manage a great diversity of data and types of information.
The material data analysis can be done from a point of view of their relevance 
regarding certain values or certain subprojects, according to their structural and 
functional viability in planning or according to their access or acquisition costs. 
With the formal and semantics data, one can adopt the social sciences or diverse 
cultures’ point of view from their ethical acceptability founded on several other 
properties and attributes to study, according to a series of parameters (skills, func-
tionalities required by a community), through conception tools and process appro-
priate to the type of data, information or knowledge required within the project’s 
framework and design context.
Experts and users/designers from all horizons largely borrow from all fields of 
knowledge and currently learn to use many creativity tools and design assistance 
platforms to conduct several types of explorations and analysis. Quebec’s users’/
designers’ communities we have surveyed between December 2011 and February 
2013 mainly learn from experts coming from various knowledge fields in order to 
lead well a collaborative portal project if the delays, budgets and members’ commit-
ment allow. However, our case studies reveal that they face several difficulties in the 
analysis tasks because of a lack of time, budget or skills. The required clarity degrees 
for the exploratory design task analysis are rarely achieved which makes it difficult 
to resort to external consultants or outsourcing, lacking the capability of “naming” 
the phenomena and the activities involved in the project. We often say: “we want a 
portal”. However, the lack of skill in the adequate analysis of the study’s phenomena 
often ends up approximately even with the help of a computer expert or designer. 
Also, physical boundaries or dimensions related to a design project are rarely clearly 
defined, so it becomes very difficult to define a first budget and action plan knowing 
the limits of the related activities, the exploratory analysis being more often impres-
sionist or under-documented.
The present book, which might seem complex at a first glance, seeks to suggest 
a simple way of performing the analysis of activities and boundaries inherent to any 
design situation and to express support requests that are more rationally dedicated 
to specialists when a project’s pre-planning and planning time comes. Like quantita-
tive studies and surveys today which do not obligate the social science researcher to 
possess high-level statistics knowledge to make his calculations, since he can resort 
to a statistician, today’s researcher must possess enough basic knowledge of tools 
and design analysis methods to collaborate with a specialist or obtain his help. 
Because of these difficulties, many projects that are half-improvised dare not com-
plete or cannot ensure their own longevity. The absence of exploratory analysis 
regularly ends up in the computer experts executing the tasks that are completely 
out of their fields of expertise, not knowing what to leave to the social science 
researchers or because they do not have the appropriate vocabulary to delegate a 
task. Currently, everywhere on the Internet, we seek to correct this situation as the 
social and communication researchers try to appropriate the vocabulary of their 
opposite in pure sciences and as they work within transdisciplinary teams to appro-
priate ontologies outside of their disciplinary comfort zone, according to a law of 
4  Community Informatics Design in Action: Towards Operational Ways of Thinking…

107
variety required in terms of terminology, an attitude, that will allow to face the chal-
lenge of the complexity of the tasks to execute in order to build transcultural digital 
social systems.
4.1.1.4  Exploratory Thinking
Many portals, websites or virtual environment projects take the shape of a trip to the 
unknown and should be led in an open way and form an administration stand point 
and the users/designers who currently participate in the global open innovation 
movement. This testing mind, this collective imagination culture of economics solu-
tions and volunteering participation to large-scale projects, needs encouragements 
at all levels of the social system because such mind is susceptible to provoke acci-
dental arrangements and unexpected discoveries that lie at the heart of the “com-
munity informatics imagination”.
These often improvised synergies can seem insignificant for many observers, but 
they are in fact a very critical and productive part of the current social Web innova-
tion. The type of research that takes place in the community informatics design’s 
process is reasonably centred on project collaboration and governance, but its results 
are largely unpredictable due to multiple emerging aspects that contain online digi-
tal social systems design.
Experienced designers who practice the design thinking understand very well 
that we can start from the known to escape in the unusual and less familiar spheres 
proper to the innovations of all kinds. Unpredicted results, surprising facts and 
unexpected discoveries can emerge when we can take the unbeaten paths. For that, 
one must be attentive to his creative colleagues, to ideas that provoke a new reflec-
tion, to conceptual explorations that help develop new sensibilities and to new atti-
tudes that contribute to the discovery of new properties of organizations and 
innovative social systems. Such explorations can be repeated and articulated at vari-
ous levels of society, at various fields of knowledge, at various scales going from the 
details of microsociology to macro-systems like international social systems and at 
the meso level of enterprises and virtual organizations. We can discover interaction 
and design patterns that allow to establish new scripts and contribute to the matura-
tion of a strategic and tactical thinking in the planning and execution of projects, 
thus feeding the imagination and the cascading decision-making inherent to all sorts 
of projects. These new directions can be re-evaluated and its patterns verified, once 
in a while, under various angles. This maturation of new ideas and feedback actions 
on patterns can be done iteratively in different design spaces as well as in various 
phases of the project at different times. They feed the oriented reflection on the pos-
sible, the feasible, the conceivable and the modelizable in the desired directions that 
go from the most abstract process to the most tangible and realistic expressions 
forms and from the simple drawing to the perfected forms of social, organizational 
and technological forms of the DSS.
4.1  Exploration Through FOSM and the Seven Design Spaces

108
4.1.1.5  Abductive Thinking
The exploratory design space is characterized by a sort or projective epistemologi-
cal process where the community informatics expert and the users/designers pro-
pose hypothesis from the observation of homogenous elements and by the intuitive 
discovery of action patterns where the objective is to validate these forms of activi-
ties, to realize dreams and collective aspirations or to cultivate hope through their 
realizations. This form of thinking, guided by the perception and the future’s con-
science, by its hopes and dangers, allowed Bateson (1972) to formulate ethics and 
aesthetic fears regarding human interventions in the world, for example, the identi-
fication of mistakes susceptible to happen again. This epistemology brings him to 
identify contact points between the words that help naming things and their map-
ping modes, whether it is solutions, problem ecosystems or conflicts, not as “con-
crete reality” (realism) but as a reality built and co-built by the mind mapping these 
entities. Bateson is interested in the mapping process rather than their simple spe-
cific existence. The mapping methodology, which he calls the ecology of the mind, 
allows to apprehend “ecology” in the larger sense we give it today, meaning the 
interaction of several species of messages, technologies and resources in a given 
cognitive context (brain/cyberspace relation, e.g.), by trying to balance and inte-
grate the potential “destabilizor” of conscious intentions of actors when they know 
to make place to different representations that do not only follow the original project 
mandate.
Bateson (1972) says the abduction is the word Pierce uses to designate the part 
of the research process where we bring forward a series of phenomena and often 
represents an occurrence of few rules previously laid down (e.g. a pattern that con-
nects life stories), but we would not stop here. According to this epistemology, the 
discoveries made in the FOSM arena can be faced with foundations and the theory 
in terms of logical level or abstraction, by comparing the relations between the word 
and the thing, between the map and the territory and between a new concept and the 
phenomenon or activity it represents. The correlations discovered in the ground, 
faced with the existing theories (patterns and models), allow to create feedback 
loops that are characteristics of an open and reflexive mind in the science process or 
in a complex design process. This is one important component important of the 
design exploration process. As a matter of fact, the abductive reasoning, contrary to 
induction and deduction, that release universal laws from individual cases or explain 
individual laws from general laws gets to project desirable properties and attributes 
in the future by exploring new forms. It is also able to move from one concept to 
another at different levels of abstraction, using a deep logic similar to the one used 
by artists and creators to make their metaphors.
This is what we discover with Bateson (1972) when he reviews his representa-
tion models under the angle of the rhetoric of different life stories through their 
different variations by exploiting them or by comparing them to a similar creation 
pattern. None has foundations that could serve for all the other ones; it is more a sort 
of self-organizing inference that is accomplished in a generative and imaginative 
way. Bateson uses abduction and the metaphor like a practice that allows oneself to 
4  Community Informatics Design in Action: Towards Operational Ways of Thinking…

109
decentralize from the object and oneself, in a way to transfer or put his attributes 
between parentheses to emancipate oneself from his properties. This avoids the trap 
of existing laws and the original identity of objects.
In the traditional discourse of science and classical logic, directed by conscious 
intentions, we try to carry out clear and distinct Cartesian representations based on 
the laws of identities. We operate by induction and deduction, we try to respect the 
types of logic, we want to get closer to the truth of the territories we explore and 
map, we observe first effective causes and we expect to be effective actors who 
cause observable consequences. In contrast, in the metaphor discourse, we always 
oscillate between the temporary “as if” preoccupation of the reality we create and 
with which we seem to religiously play. On the other hand is the fall and reconstitu-
tion of deep logical types. This epistemological pendulum is at the heart of Warfield’s 
FOSM (1986), who, while proposing axioms and foundation laws for the commu-
nity informatics design, also questions the metaphysics of these identity laws and 
introduces differences that contribute to intuitive results that, even if they are still 
not demonstrable, they remain a tangible consequence of our interventions.
If the metaphor and abduction pave the way of the community informatics 
design, the individual and collective imagination become central in the forms of 
distributed cognition and co-production of innovation to establish the collaborative 
governance of complex projects and the coordination of intelligence and large-scale 
collective skills. Collective imagination is the playful collaborative exercise that 
consists of utilizing community abduction and metaphor abilities to escape and 
crush the past efficient causes to introduce differences in the world of knowledge 
that represent “a difference that makes a difference”, according to the famous 
Bateson expression (Bateson 1972). Of course, the participative community infor-
matics design always needs analysis and diagnostics that will allow the intervention 
of induction- and deduction-like research process, but it goes further than that. 
Indeed, in accordance with the Pierce epistemology, followed by Bateson (1972) 
and Warfield (1986), its practices and interventions are founded not only on the idea 
of logical consequences but also on the projective inferences one that, in the users’/
designers’ mind and mental processes, are the equivalent of a causality generated 
imagination.
We could say that by injecting novelty in the world through imagination, we 
consciously provoke the transformation, which gives us the role of victims of the 
ongoing social mutations and the role of actors at the causes of these changes. The 
creator and the designer operate upon a research logic that seeks to consciously and 
collectively introduce novelty in the world, without necessarily be preoccupied by 
the idea of truth in the sense of classical logic, worrying instead about the ethical 
orientation of the future according to the desirable praxeological orientation of our 
future. We will retort that this represents a human potentiality that has always 
existed. But in the social Web era with its collaborative design platforms, the ubiq-
uitous collective imagination, the operating capacity to collectively and massively 
introduce novelty in the world through telepresence mechanisms, to shatter all “ide-
ological ready to wear”, anywhere, with anyone, anytime and at a low cost, repre-
sents a unique opportunity, never seen before in history, to innovate and orientate 
4.1  Exploration Through FOSM and the Seven Design Spaces

110
human activities. The ubiquitous imagination represents a unique potential to imag-
ine the virtual worlds that will accompany “idealistic” research and design for a 
better quality of life on Earth.
From this human capacity to imagine a new world, to play with what is real and 
what is not, from the representational gaps difficult to fill between the model and the 
represented thing, between the map and the territory, we will progressively build a 
new abductive science. Of these intangible simulated worlds that explode and rede-
fine our minds, of this epistemological adventure in which things and their relations 
are anticipated and brought to the forefront, of this new living together transdisci-
plinary complexity, of the preoccupation for the deep logic, of this tyranny of induc-
tive and deductive science, of these powerful visualization metaphors of worlds to 
be built “as if” like infinite innovation potential and of these open possibilities in the 
creative and free meanders of the social Web, we will try to build new skills, a new 
profession and new research trajectory based on an ubiquitous imagination that 
refuses domestication. Ubiquitous imagination opens unprecedented horizons and 
possibilities of co-creation and co-design. Like all horizons, community informatics 
imagination proposes points of reference and properties that are far from being 
opposed to reality. To the contrary, the community informatics expert practices a 
profession that oscillates between interaction rituals and action logic, between pure 
sciences and social sciences, between the traditional and the metaphorical and 
between the “lived” world history and its anticipation. These dialectical processes 
are at the heart of design situations we explore in this book.
4.1.1.6  Synthetic Thinking
The aptitude to play and articulate the ecosystem parts and the whole is an integral 
part of the community informatics design, just like it is necessary to be able to build 
exploratory tasks from the general to the particular and vice versa, going backwards 
a certain number of times as long as the design planning or modeling is in explor-
atory and intuitive mode. The research and explorations help precisely a certain 
number of alternative dimensions and scripts that are not rejected a priori but that 
are kept in reserve as potential orientations, following the collective learnings pro-
vided by the relation of dimensions and variables related to the digital social sys-
tems design. Certain facts or dimensions can seem far from the starting issue when 
we first “bird’s eye view”, analyse, but they fall into place as the practice team or 
community collectively identifies the variables and criteria that will serve to pro-
duce the ideal desirable concept, what we can call the “concept de design” or the to 
be validated prototype. This concept matured through the seven spaces of creation 
of the community informatics design.
The design concept possesses a very large number of properties, as we will see 
further along in this book. However, the reduction of these properties into fields by 
observation of interactions, relations and links between the concepts allow to seize 
them in one large expression. Furthermore, it is the role of the model and modeling 
of complex systems; this reduction helps the necessary decision-making along the

team of users’/designers’ progression in the exploratory design space, articulated in 
the seven spaces and various thinking modes channelled in their dialogue modes 
which contribute to update them.
It is strictly speaking a synthesis process that is usually realized during a visual-
ization activity (exploratory matrix, discovery matrix, conceptual mapping and vari-
ous drawings) able to capture the complexity of a design situation’s aspects and to 
favour the mastery of a set of properties or attributes that characterizes a design situ-
ation and its particular arrangements. The divers’ fields of design and their specific 
dimensions (needs, functionalities, tools, architectures) are no longer apprehended 
like accessories or indirectly related one to another, but more like a global model 
system of global expression as defined by Mucchielli (2005, 2006). A total ecosys-
tem contains visible and invisible, tangible and intangible and quantitative and qual-
itative elements. An evolutive global system containing a series of properties and 
criteria integrated into a design concept overview that satisfied the starting inten-
tions and objectives of the designers’ community as well as the stakeholders.
This synthesis exercise can take place during the different phases of the life cycle 
or a design planning strategy, either to update relations between concepts and 
dimensions or simply to feed discussions to better understand the emerging alterna-
tives or even to add educational elements to the feasible demonstration (proof of 
concept) or to the prototype. It allows to critically examine the links between the 
components of a design situation, to identify the potential vision obstacles and con-
flicts as well as contributing to extend the debate and democratic participation to an 
extended community, other teams or the entire society. Thus promoting, when the 
dialogue requires it, the appropriation of a participative culture capacitated by the 
co-design of a particular social system (education, health, cultural industries, com-
munity media, enterprise collaborative networks, etc.).
4.1.1.7  Reflexive Thinking
Reflexive thinking is in fact a “reflexive practice” as defined by Donald Schön 
(1983). Reflexive practice is an action mode that tries to distance itself from the 
design process to evaluate its development or the evolution of the entire process or 
even to objectify a particular practice. The evaluative processes range from the con-
tinuous evaluation of objectives to the validation effects of a given social media on 
co-design, including the skills evaluation. The technical and methodological tools 
used can be of subjective or objective nature. Several properties are rejected or 
accepted according to subjective appreciation or non-appreciation criteria. Other 
criteria contain measurable attributes, like costs to observe, the performance of the 
design team and the functional boundaries (functionalities to put in place or to 
respect). Then, we can resort to analytical tools and particular processes. In several 
cases of institutional development and creation of business, procedures and norm 
process as well as particular regulation mechanisms require a more formal evalua-
tion in the co-design of a playful community, for example. Furthermore, when par-
ticular norms must be observed, the users’/designers’ community is reminded to 
4.1  Exploration Through FOSM and the Seven Design Spaces

112
respect these rules or even document its actions and activities towards a future revi-
sion or a potential update made necessary by the fast evolution of the legal, cultural 
or socio-economical context.
However, like in any good imagination and creation process, the community 
informatics design of DSS does not only contain rational choices. Several choices 
on an ethic and aesthetic level are not guided by economics or quantitative consid-
erations. For example, the readability of screen pages often depends on the artist/
designer, his judgement, his senses and his personal preferences. The sponsors and 
the direction systematically trust the media designer. In Chap. 5, when we define the 
different aspects related to the DSS design, we will see that subjective, aesthetic and 
qualitative criteria of all sort can intervene in the modeling and design of various 
properties and attributes of a system. These “beauty” criteria and these playful or 
harmonious aspects are decided on the basis of an individual or group vision, and 
only time and use will tell us if the decision that has been made lead to the success 
or the failure of a project within its launch context.
Talking about context, we will admit that most of the time, the user and the 
designer do not have much control over it, until it is expressly to act upon the con-
text like in the case of global democratic participation within a given society or to 
evaluate and modify the social roles of a university within the general state context 
on education. In this case, different stakeholders act upon a global expression and 
communication system, and their decisions could have an impact on the choices and 
decisions relating to a very large systemic group. However, in the case of large-scale 
community informatics design concerning decisions that involve large social sys-
tems (education, health, legal system) or at the cultural level of a society, the context 
contains its own evolutive life cycle, and the reflexive qualities of all communica-
tional action in an exploratory and learning design space run the risk of being in 
conflict with other forms of thinking or vision. The stakeholders in place undertake 
actions susceptible to modify or orientated differently the starting intentions of each 
other. The thoughts, the values and the beliefs of other social actors can also inflect 
the basic orientations of a team of designers or a very large community of users/
designers. A particular DSS design can hurt the convictions and interests of differ-
ent groups, make waves and provoke changes in the context which forces other 
creators to answer in a reflexive, strategic or tactical way to different actions. Each 
one acts according to its own thinking and belief mode. A competition for the 
actions’ legitimization is then put in place, the basic idea being that the proactive 
reflection is a vast learning experiential and social mechanism.
We will see these different thinking modes that helped us throughout the research 
process are often implicitly used in various creation processes. They can become 
explicit by the reflection, training and design education at various cycles of our 
learning systems. The set of the seven thinking modes completes the FOSM and the 
seven spaces methodology because their contents translate an intentional and opera-
tional reference framework that allows to directly map several of the main proper-
ties and attributes of the digital social systems (infrastructures, architectures, 
functionalities, socio-technologies) that can be programmed for the first time into 
computer systems and subsystems oriented towards the objects and aspects which 
4  Community Informatics Design in Action: Towards Operational Ways of Thinking…

113
will be the topic of the chapter on instantiation methodology and discovery matrices 
(Chap. 7). Also, properties and attributes of the group of fields involved in the mod-
eling and visualization process will function as object/aspect agents in various ref-
erence frameworks of collaborative designs. Coupled with higher elaborated 
thinking modes, the fields will be developed with their respective visualization 
agents, and each mode will shed light on different fields that will be translated into 
various autonomous visualization modes in the context of intervention of a team of 
computer designers.
4.2  FOSM Implications and Its Various Thinking Modes 
for Community Informatics Design’s Creation
The overview model takes its value in a series of implications. The first one is pro-
vided by a reasoning space where we can better understand the claims of a science 
regarding the maturity of its development, meaning we can follow the iterative and 
evolutive development mode through various disciplinary thinking modes. Warfield 
speaks of “literative” development because by combining the L of learning with 
“iterative”, he obtains a neologism that explicitly refers to learning. We will add our 
own L to refer to the “languages” of the community informatics design’s science 
and its various thinking modes that will help us elaborate terminological elements 
and the evolutive science vocabulary according to these various thinking modes that 
serve to update and evaluate it. Thus, a scientific development process can be “lit-
erative” because it integrates the social learning process of a science through natural 
languages, various thinking modes and specialized languages. The “literatition” 
represents the evolution of as well as the maturation of a science. It allows to bring 
conceptual and practical improvements to an aspiring science taking into consider-
ation the contradictions or convergences discovered by applications with respect to 
a corpus. However, this process can only work if we examine in detail all the con-
nections and the overview network. For that, we need all community informatics 
design’s project stakeholder to have a sense of responsibility that transcends indi-
vidual interests of practice communities associated with each block. We believe that 
this responsibility can be favoured by living labs and innovation put to contributions 
in the training about the FOSM, its seven design spaces and its seven intentional 
thinking modes which we will come back to. Broken connections between theory 
and methodology and between applications and foundations can reflect a lack of 
interest and even responsibility for their joint maturation in time and space of 
research.
The FOSM had important repercussions at the level of our own evaluation of 
APSI research process. Indeed, whether someone is motivated or not by the research 
process, as generic knowledge tied to one or the other four blocks, nor by the net-
work between foundations, the theories, methodologies and the applications can be 
operationalized or improved with the help of a particular thinking mode. In the 
4.2  FOSM Implications and Its Various Thinking Modes for Community Informatics…

114
future, this model will serve as a global intervention framework, for example, in 
the evaluation of ICT as research support elements, at the conceptual level as well 
as at the level of specific methodology like modeling and society simulation. It will 
also help verify if certain results are disconnected from reality or if some others can 
be related to the corpus and to the community informatics design’s data base.
In addition, the FOSM contains organizational properties that inspired our way 
of “disciplining” our community informatics design approach and to develop this 
applied science model by coupling fields that are usually disjointed, for example: 
the coupling between instantiation, software and architecture engineering and the 
idea of organizations of interactions in communication; between cooperative man-
agement and collaborative networks; between semiotics and the analysis of levels of 
reality involved in STS projects and the implantation of an innovation colab-type 
portal. We found a great utility in it for the organization of our concepts and for the 
presentation of our research results which helps students to develop a desire for 
organization in their scientific work.
The FOSM has also been useful in the presentation of various chapters of the 
present book and in the holistic and systemic appreciation of diverse parts of the 
research. It helps the researcher and the graduate studies student to present the 
research stages and results by taking into account the necessity of a communica-
tional process supported within the members of a scientific practice community and 
various stakeholders involved in the partnership. It favours relations and important 
interactions for the evaluation of roles of different members involved in very differ-
ent ways in a project, sometimes isolated or more at ease with separated “blocks”. 
The model also contributes to determine the digital skills to promote in various 
fields and professions involved in the diverse fields of community informatics as a 
science, as well as the different types of sectorial leadership to develop to keep the 
dynamism of the iterative mechanism in its whole. It helps define and realize the 
task in a coordinate way, according to the plurality of thinking modes and interac-
tive mechanisms between blocks, while continuing to integrate these processes and 
all people in the organizational systemic and iterative vision resulting what we have 
been calling communityship for several years.
With that in mind, the model contains obvious social properties for those who 
want to examine the distribution and coordination of activities and roles historically 
attributed to fundamental sciences and applied sciences. One of the great merits of 
the model within our team was certainly to help determine the roles of technologies 
and collaboration tools within the community informatics design. Our “entry” in 
technology through action verbs lead us to evaluate the possible alignment between 
modeling technologies and design instrumentalized functionalities identified by 
verbs in a given design situation and context: “identify”, “list”, “define”, “classify”, 
“rank”, “link together”, “interact”, “model”, “sketch”, “draw”, “simulate”, “instan-
tiate” and “facilitate”. All this work of activity identification (Engenstrom 1999) 
and design task by verbs, under the direction of our colleague Gilles Lemire, appears 
in various chapters of the present book.
Finally, the model contains some important historical filiations with the prag-
matic philosophy of Charles Sanders Peirce, which we will see in the next pages 
4  Community Informatics Design in Action: Towards Operational Ways of Thinking…

115
regarding the ontological usefulness to pave the philosophical way for community 
informatics design in the action (Heylighen 2007) and communicational action 
according to Habermas (1973, 1984). The FOSM allows to distinguish community 
informatics design (as well as its related sciences: social Web, computer-mediatized 
communication, the STS sector, collective telework, human-computer interaction, 
human-computer interfaces, socio-technical, interactive, participative design and, 
actually, the new cyber-physical systems in the Internet of Things and the Internet 
of Places) as a generic collaboration science as well as the technology supporting 
and resulting it. The idea is to keep at the same level, equal and complementary 
respecting humans, their resources and imagination tools, just like Kling (1973, 
1996, 1999, 2000a, b, 2007; Kling et al. 2001, 2005), Moles (Moles and Rohmer 
1998; Moles and Jacobus 1988; Moles 1981) and several other researchers have 
done before us.
4.3  Some Overall Implicit Model Restrictions
To conclude this chapter, we now consider the consequences of a limited FOSM 
application to community informatics design, meaning to the intervention, research 
or research-action models that are made of sub-models of the overall model.
At the corpus level, it could be very possible for a community to limit its interests 
and observations to the foundations and the theory. It is often the case for episte-
mologists and philosophers of sciences.
At the arena level, a practice community could very well limit its considerations 
to the methodology and its applications on the ground. It is often the case for the 
research-action specialists.
At the theory level, it is also possible to be only interested in the articulation of 
concepts in a given issue without worrying about the foundations. It is currently 
often the case in the fields of information and community informatics that very 
rarely questions their own foundations.
At the applications level, we realize that currently, the majority of the social Web 
users are only interested in the social Web tools’ applications and collaborative 
platforms and that they do not even consider being interested in the development of 
the design thinking methodology.
We will evaluate this implications’ assessment briefly.
The restrictions of this type have been treated widely in the scientific works dedi-
cated to information systems and community informatics, and their implications are 
rather well documented. Thus, we will keep schematically reminding certain prob-
lems that happen when a team or a community limits itself to one or the other of 
these restrictions:
•	 The innovation community is quickly faced with application difficulties like the 
lack of supervision for the promotion of innovation, the lack of transparency 
between actors, the scapegoat issue, the intellectual property issue, the lack of 
norms and procedures and the unfounded threats and rumours.
4.3  Some Overall Implicit Model Restrictions

116
•	 Students take classes and training sessions that encourage the same type of irre-
sponsible behaviour, containing uncertain theories and unproven methodologies, 
without any sense of foundation because there are no foundations.
•	 Scientific documentation favouring articles where quantitative methods, under 
the multitude of curves and statistic data, hide a poor true theoretical and practi-
cal innovation. This attitude favours the interests of those who seek to obtain a 
promotion within their faculty, but it certainly has very little impact on the real 
problems of our society. In the worst case, it reaches results that contribute to 
increase the problems. We can ask ourselves if “our designs” really improve the 
life conditions for all.
•	 In the current explosion of the participative culture and the massive innovation, 
it is more and more difficult to distinguish the conclusive and structuring innova-
tions from those who are more short-lived enterprises or researches without qual-
ity because of our incompetence to consider them in comprehensive and thorough 
contexts.
•	 It is more and more difficult to capitalize on the knowledge associated with 
remarkable realizations in the development of our innovative social systems and 
methodologies that serve to study and build them. The fact that this knowledge is 
not adequately reflected in the fields of applications might compromise the vali-
dation of our future social systems’ performance.
•	 The extensive loss of knowledge due to an information overload or lack or reflec-
tion in the action might become recurrent and be more and more difficult to 
control.
•	 The teaching of appropriate thinking modes to various design situations and their 
contribution in the activities of the community informatics experts might be 
compromised. The absence of training on those various thinking modes and the 
forms of dialogue that support them might provoke an “improvisation without 
memory” that would generalize by the “digital illiteracy” of our students and the 
entire population.
•	 No matter how the innovation culture fragment itself, without real network links 
or without innovative structured social systems, our cultures and our society 
might become more and more vulnerable to other cultures that have massively 
decided to structure their national digital platform within vast research programs 
that validate massive innovation and collaborative design models. These, sup-
ported by a scientific design model which is articulated around a “reflexive pro-
cess thinking mode” founded on technology.

Generic Communication and Community 
Informatics Design: Evaluation and Validation 
of Socio-technical Design of a Universal 
Communication Platform, the Informatics 
Design Assistance System, Using 
the CAPACITÉS Evaluation Model
Our analysis of elements related to the development of a model of processes involved 
in the co-creation of socio-technical platforms seeks to result in useful norms for 
various types of collaborative design. The analysis is the first stags. Design rules are 
the synthetic result. First, the analysis allows to gather information, to measure 
them, to evaluate them and to incorporate them in the interactive construction, 
according to standardized rules, purpose of the previous operations.
This aspect allows us to justify the final “S” of CAPACITÉS and to determine the 
capacities of the systems thus built to generate rules, thanks to which the machine 
regulates its technological potential. The implementation of standardized, transcul-
tural rules acts as a bridge between the learning process through different languages 
(animated images, sketches, figures or natural languages), first moments of the 
deployment of a learning platform by community informatics design and transcul-
tural by these different languages, second moment of this deployment. It relies on 
our previous works (Harvey and Bertrand 2004; Harvey and Lemire 2001) devoted 
to the establishment of a communication model of the “dynamic appropriation”. We 
take the sector of education and the learning communicational platforms as an exam-
ple in order to make the abstract reality of platforms more cognitively accessible.
Design is primarily a thought process and communication 
process, transferring into action by communication. It is a 
natural function, expressed in the many activities we engage in. 
For the teleologist, design means the conscious attempt to 
create a better world. For the antitleologist design is the 
conscious part of action.

5.1  The Context
The online learning models generally contain two platforms: a technological plat-
form and a didactic platform. The functionalities and applications of the learning 
unit that allow to manage the learning uses and activities are of two orders: techno-
logical and social. The construction of a resource centre with its platforms and Web 
applications around different learning communities represents a socio-technical 
system (STS), meaning a social system built on a technological basis. The goal of 
this chapter is to present the parameters that guide the analysis and the construction 
of this socio-technical system.
A STS adds communicational and social demands from users to those of human-­
computer interactions. These interactions themselves contain needs related to the 
interface ergonomics and in place of the body and the body language in the didactic 
space, which pose specific conditions related to the infrastructure (hardware) and 
software.
A practice platform and community (experts, learners, stakeholders and part-
ners) are dedicated to the learning of a language or another discipline, from a socio-­
technical system (as defined by Whitworth and De Moor 2009a) using technology 
to socially connect people through various types of communicational and didactic 
tools (Harvey and Lemire 2001), for example, learning modules for vocabulary, the 
animated image’s grammar as well as the computer-mediatized communication on 
various platforms: email, social media and networks, learning exchange systems, 
e-commerce, blogs, chats, etc. If technologies are often new, social interaction prin-
ciples between people are not. However, lately, technological innovation values 
tend to conceal sociological bases that give birth to these innovations and orientate 
their development, which translates into not always happy results or even contradic-
tory ones in regard to desired results. We can quote the negative impact of certain 
video games on the concentration and conceptualization capacity of some young 
people. It is a real problem with unknown consequences yet. Several questions arise 
regarding the new ways of learning, reading, listening, memorizing, writing, design-
ing, representing knowledge and interacting.1 An important reflection is currently 
taking place surrounding what we call “the computer-mediatized educational 
communication”.
The needs and requirements of performing learning communities whether they 
are mediatized by computer or by physical world data (face to face or telepresence) 
contain several similarities. But we should not underestimate the impact of this bi-­
modality even less the learning multi-supported by ICT. With this in mind, socio-­
technical systems like distance education platforms must incorporate the 
psychosocial needs and technical performance, meaning meet the needs of the com-
munity and technical functionalities. If learning communities like UQAM’s My 
Portal Col@b, under construction, are essentially social systems of people interact-

119
ing with other people in a didactic social space, then didactic communication prin-
ciples must guide the implantation of the platform, instead of a design too exclusively 
orientated towards technology. Here, technology cannot be designed as a simple 
tool detached from human representation; instead, it becomes a stakeholder of the 
constitution of a new representation mode in various animated forms. In this case, 
we talk about “transformation technologies”. What does this expression mean?
Transformation technologies contain a certain number or computing tools that 
have a major repercussion on the representation and acting mode of the human 
being. It transforms both the mind and the body. While technical tools have been 
progressively detaching themselves from the body to become technical objects, 
these new knowledge tools restore technology as an intermediary between the body 
and the mind, between the gesture and the speech. In this sense, we can consider 
them like mediation technologies. Technology becomes a logos, speech of the mind, 
and a technè, gesture of the body. Internet provokes subtle changes, even undesired 
ones in our brains. It also modifies our body habits by making us more sedentary. 
Therefore, it influences our ways of life and our daily conducts.
Community informatics design is in the line of these transformation technolo-
gies. It updates them in the preliminary learning process of the creation of transcul-
tural or universal communication networks. It is about learning through different 
languages, like animation. Learning through animation is a teaching system that 
uses the image and animated image to try to make a bridge between languages and 
a new mode of transcultural communication. The animated image only makes sense 
according to the concept it corresponds to in the text. Learning through animation is 
an application of new technologies of transfers between the text and the animation 
related to the transformation technologies.
The evaluation tools in networking and systems theory we want to build and we 
want to account for in the present book constitute technological and sociological 
markers that allow to incorporate all the constitutive factors of this new anthropo-
logical transformation, towards which technological and current globalization pro-
cesses are aiming.
UQAM’s “Applied Community Informatics Lab” (ACIL) and its partners wish to 
contribute to the co-creation of a real learning society of online social systems’ 
design, to the extent here the partnership will succeed in establishing a social and 
educational synergy that is open and ethical: people respect others’ ideas without 
subduing their freedom nor threatening their intellectual property, their reputation 
or their credibility. To establish cooperation and collaboration between various 
agents’ real or virtual (like in the Internet of Things), people must be able to com-
municate with each other and coordinate their activities.
The global success of learning platforms like the Colab platform in ACIL depends 
on the way the global design of socio-technical systems jointly optimizes techno-
logical dimensions and online interaction architecture that support social and com-
municational dimensions of the didactic space; this is what we call “social 
architecture”.
5.1  The Context

5.2  Towards a Generic Communication Model
The traditional communication and didactic applied linguistics models consider 
their scientific analysis object as the verbal language, which is the regular language 
where words, phrase and texts constitute the basic entities. By keeping this objec-
tive, we avoid the fundamental contributions of the physical spaces, body language 
and gesture in the didactic communicational process.
We must understand where does this traditional model limitations come from in 
order to better comprehend the inputs of the new community informatics design’s 
approach as design with a communicational and social nature. Here, in fact, the 
question is not only about linguistics. It agrees with the very own language origins 
and from this anthropological and cultural transformation that allowed the human 
thought to emancipate itself from the instinctive nature constraints and to break with 
the limits of the perceptive body.
The community informatics design communicational model seeks to resituate 
the semiotic function of the body to allow it to free itself from the salvage animality 
constraints that weigh heavily on the current miserable human conscience in a deep 
transformation. Therefore, with the different natural and visual languages of the 
future My Portal Col@b platform, we could be able to take into consideration the 
entire aspect of behaviours linked to the body language and the movement of people 
in the social space and time of virtual animated learning environments.
This situation is still strange because when we observe communication phenom-
ena like where two people or members of a work group interact, it immediately 
appears to our senses and representations that we are facing multiple modalities of 
meaning creations, through actors’ activities and experiences. In fact, the inter-­
actors produce holistic and generic communication acts where the linguistics part 
must be extracted from a larger communication act. Several studies show that the 
verbal language constitutes only a small part of our capacity to communicate. So 
why is it the dominant language? It is the fact that it belongs to the field of symbolic 
and abstract reason that commands the human conduct. It occupies the majority of 
the semantics field that makes the human being able to produce universal concepts. 
The word represents the concept. And until here, humanity has not been able to 
produce a sign system equivalent to the word system of symbolic language. This is 
why, by transferring the semantics function of words into images, diagrams and 
animated images (computer graphic objects), we will be able to create a new lan-
guage that will also be invested of the semantics power of words and incorporate 
other dimensions of the body, especially the aesthetic dimension kept away from the 
semantics field of logos until now. Therefore, by combining the aesthetics and 
semantics functions of human faculties in only one representation, we could resitu-
ate this harmony of the body and the mind by reconciling the body’s impulses, now 
focused towards a superior level of aesthetic representations (transcendental), and 
the capacities of the human logos, which would have already achieved this level of 
superior transcendence. This is what our social project consists of, meaning the 
5  Generic Communication and Community Informatics…

121
communicational project of the socio-technical design of human activity system 
called the community informatics design.
The fact that we are first conceptualizing a cognition being instead of an interac-
tion being containing multiple communicational modalities like the body, the situa-
tion and the technology is nothing new. In fact, historically, we can distinguish five 
sources, if we consider the mythical period when the human reason does not yet 
aspire to be logos equal to the Gods. It is the Greeks who inaugurate the reason like 
logos, measure of all things as they are and as they are not. Thus, in Western history, 
here is how is stretched the domination of logical reason, logos, on the body 
impulses and all that is connected to it:
	1.	 Ancient Greek philosophy, which insists on the logos as a meaning, simultane-
ously rational mind and verbal language, reason discourse against rhetoric, dis-
course and body language art, mind cavern, prisoners of the senses.
	2.	 The Judeo-Christian disjunction/reduction between the body and the mind that 
recuperates the myth (divine logos) in favour of reason (human logos). This is 
how theology is born, the science of God, as if the divine logos could be objects 
of science, submitted to the human reasoning.
	3.	 The Cartesian dualist rationalism, which makes the thought the main substance, 
the indestructible rock of all truth. The body is the animal part, the mechanic of 
the human being, the temporary compartment of the spiritual mind.
	4.	 The formal structuralism of Saussure, with its decentration of the individual per-
formance, the speech and its accent on society language. Linguistics is born in 
this double articulation of the phenomenon language and the sense with it, the 
treatment of language as an autonomous structure equipped with quantitative 
and qualitative properties of any other phenomenon of nature or culture.
	5.	 Chomsky’s linguistics, with its intrinsic negligence of the body’s performance 
and its total centration on a grammatical, ideal or mental skill. With the recent 
studies on the complexity and philosophy of communicational sciences orien-
tated towards action, pragmatism or praxeology (action and activities oriented 
towards the emancipation of the human being) of the “incorporated mind”, time 
has come to promote socio-technical projects where the linguistics dimension 
incorporates the body and gesture in total communication situations where all 
other parts of the communicational action are designed like dynamic communi-
cation ecosystems that incorporate cognition, biology and the body, networking 
technology and social and physical environment.
This means the conceptual framework and analysis practice and the construc-
tion of learning environments like My Portal Col@b, designed at UQAM like a 
virtual social assistance system to the construction of other online social sys-
tems, can no longer be restricted by rational aspects of the cognitive being and, 
instead, must be designed at various levels of society – micro, meso and macro – 
by integrating in its reference framework the irrational, intangible, emergent, 
abstract and qualitative aspects like emotions, motivations, ethics, society, group 
and community dimensions, etc. Another important aspect of the consequences 
from this orientation is that “the language faculty” of the individual (his skills 
5.2  Towards a Generic Communication Model

122
and capacities) must be understood as a generic system of holistic communica-
tion containing the discourse and the behaviour, the animated language commu-
nication or the “diagrammatic” or visualization languages gathering the 
characteristics of verbal and non-verbal communication, the communication and 
learning situations and the behavioural and experiential semiotic. To synthetize 
our approach, we will say that My Portal Col@b is a collaborative and imagina-
tive platform based on a communicational transdisciplinary model, a generic 
socio-­technical communication and multimodal learning system practised by 
human and social organizations as an organizational and socio-communicational 
totality.
This generic transdisciplinary communication model (Fig. 5.1) will be succinctly 
and schematically presented here. It will be developed and implanted all through the 
experimental phase of prototyping of evolutive solutions of the “SADC platform”. 
It will be the conceptual framework, trans-scientific, transdisciplinary and metathe-
oretical serving the basis of construction of the experimental framework (see the 
“stairs model”, meaning the CAPACITÉS approach) with which we will evaluate 
and validate the functionalities and different applications of My Portal Col@b.
5.3  The Semio-pragmatic Communication Star
The semio-pragmatic communication approach is a generic reference framework 
that tries to take into account the several aspects of the human communication 
(bodily, verbal, non-verbal, psychological, social, technological) to incorporate 
them in researches and developments where several disciplines are brought in to 
increase the understanding of its various fields and their articulation on everyday 
life and the different human activities’ systems. It tries to incorporate the various 
theories’ assets like Maturana and Varela (1980, 1984) and Luhmann’s (1989, 1995) 
autopoietic systems and Warfield’s generic design foundations with its ontology and 
epistemology, themselves largely supported by Pierce’s semiotic pragmatism, von 
Foerster’s second-order cybernetics, Soren Brier’s works on cyber-semiotic (2000, 
2008, 2013) as well as Searle (1969) and Habermas’s theories on collective action’s 
intentions (1973, 1984).
Our under construction model tries to go beyond the models that have inspired 
design and the implantation of information systems for decades as well as the infor-
mation treatment machines which are characteristic of the traditional artificial intel-
ligence program. A pragmatic communicational model inspired by second-order 
cybernetics means that what is observed in the reality is not only of the same type 
of the observed situation, which is cognitively and communicational socio built, but 
that the subject observers, without being located outside like transcendental observ-
ers, are also represented like stakeholders of a collective observation and collabora-
tive design process. The observers, users/designers, in accordance with the 
5  Generic Communication and Community Informatics…

movement of the third phase science described in the previous chapters, are consid-
ered as living organisms involved in the observation process like bio-psycho-­
sociocultural human operators that partake in network social practices while 
researching the evolution of new modalities of science proper to the living labs and 
Colab movement. The appropriation of knowledge, the imagination of new human 
activity systems, the communicational action and the socio-technical design are 
devised here like collective semio-pragmatic activities. Thus this ontological posi-
tion and this epistemological demand support that the observer or the researcher is 
not only an individual subject but an intersubjective collective of stakeholders that, 
more and more, incorporates university researchers, government actors and the civil 
society of users/designers. Also, social and economic innovation is related to this 
attitude since it promotes the idea of collective imagination instead of the invention 
of an isolated solitary genius. This is why the “I” in the discovery connects with the 
“we” of the collective network imagination to greatly accelerate the online social 
systems’ design process that is a necessary condition for the massive citizen innova-
tion by networking.
The communicational semio-pragmatic star can be represented by a seven-­
pointed star where languages (semiotics), design practices (pragmatic) and values 
(ethics and axiology) are placed at the heart of the star to feed a rising universal 
conscience (humans and observers’ faculty to judge of their own globalized reality) 
(Fig. 5.1).
This way we can, from this heart, proceed with the dynamic description of the 
several points of the semio-pragmatic communicational star.
	1.	 At the heart of the star: The boiling of dynamic quantitative relations – animated 
or visual language qualitative ↔ facing the universal conscience as a faculty for 
humans to know their own reality and to judge it. As the new languages increase 
like animated languages from the cultural singularities of the world, this collec-
tive consciousness develops new realities like current social transformations that 
need to be problematized, imagined, resolved and identified.
“Knowing” is no longer the activity of a conscience thorn by multiple scat-
tered objects here and there in an exterior reality and in an unfinished culture. 
“Knowing” becomes a semiotic, pragmatic and ethic activity at the same time.
Around the heart: The contexts, environments, elements and properties’ 
sphere that feed the heart of the star and project towards the exterior the transfor-
mations operated in the heart of the star:
•	 The physical infrastructures, essential conditions indispensable for the pro-
duction and the maintenance of the entire system.
•	 The worlds of social action, language and discourse that assume the physical 
infrastructures and organize the communicational processes and social pro-
duction, design and sociocultural development connections.
•	 The cognitive worlds, the worlds of interfaces, architectures and superstruc-
tures, which give a sense to the basic infrastructures and orientate the existen-
tial sense of other worlds.
5.3  The Semio-pragmatic Communication Star

124
•	 The worlds of technological mediations that reinforce basic infrastructures as 
scientific, technological, cultural and relational superstructures. These worlds 
provide the necessary and sufficient tools for the development of other worlds.
•	 Collective and collaborative intelligence platform, space open to the entire 
humanity for its transformations as a harmonized cosmic species.
•	 The learning systems, generators of new types of humans more involved in 
the social becoming and having more and more access to superior levels of 
knowledge and knowledge sharing.
•	 The body’s faculty development, as an incorporated entity, at the same time 
individual and community subject, more and more open to the collective 
humanization process and the socially responsible communicational design.
	2.	 The seven points of the star and their external derivatives: Of this second inter-
mediary sphere are developed the seven points of the star, to give place to the 
constitutive external results of the semio-pragmatic star. These results mark the 
opening of the star to the cultural and cosmic world:

•	 To the physical infrastructures corresponds this emerging environment of the 
human world, a new place where human being activities of the life world can 
evolve.
Energy, order and disorder are the outcomes of this point. They reflect the 
quantitative and qualitative levels of the basic infrastructures. It is the basic 
ecological and environmental level.
•	 The worlds of social action and language create universal history and culture 
as places for language and memorization of the entire humanity. Collective 
memory establishes a new dynamic of representation appropriate to the cur-
rent globalization processes. The world becomes society and society is glo-
balized through various interactions of cultural singularities.
•	 The cognitive worlds are the worlds of sense and experimental development 
as existential experience of the knowing subjects and observers.
The conscience is an eruption of the experience of the self. It is related to the 
cognitive world in its quest for certainty and truth. The individual conscience 
is related to other consciences through languages, memory and collective 
imagination of more favourable words for the human being.
•	 The technological mediations’ worlds are new development spaces for the 
communication interfaces.
The technological interfaces, but also anthropological, between human and 
machine pave the way for this emancipation desire related to the emergence 
of a responsible communication, at the service of sustainable development, 
which is intended to set free the current humanity.
•	 The collective intelligence platform, which My Portal Col@b will use, with 
other transfer technologies: Texte ↔ Visual Animation become porters as new 
transcultural (universal) communication tools.
Communication networks and virtual and animated tools belong to virtual 
modes, always in expansion. They inaugurate these new radical transforma-
tion cycles allowing humanity to achieve, in an uncertain and undetermined 
future, this ubiquitous imagination concept and collective conscience looking 
to the future.
•	 Learning systems are generators of new types of cultural attitudes more and 
more accessible to superior levels of knowledge.
•	 The body’s faculty development makes it an incorporated entity, at the same 
time individual and community subject and more and more open to collective 
humanization processes.
By incorporating itself in the cultural and global space-time, the boiling at the 
heart of the star can bring out all sorts of combinatorial variations allowing to under-
stand the sense and trajectory of this stellar system’s activities:
•	 Either the star is in full activity and is deployed through its intrinsic properties.
•	 Either it is in a degradation process, gradually losing its potentialities.
The measuring and visually evaluating mechanisms must allow at any time to 
diagnose the system’s state of development and its components.
5.3  The Semio-pragmatic Communication Star

126
Furthermore, we should determine the quantitative and qualitative properties of 
each point of the star in order to extract the common traits and differences. Therefore, 
we could measure the impact values of the different constitutive components of the 
Un (the unit of plurality) and the way the entire stellar system moves in a given 
cultural and global space-time.
Our colleague Lionel Audant considers that there is an entire research to be done, 
from the elaboration of an algorithm point of view as well as the construction of 
various components in their quantitative and qualitative links, both complementary 
and contradictory. For now, the mathematical formulations of this algorithm are not 
presented here (underlying the patent on matrix function of the cosmic code), which 
are only providing framework elements for such research. Needless to say, it is a 
transdisciplinary and international research that would require the collaboration of 
several experts for the “algorithmic” point of view as well as the socio-technical 
one. The quantitative and qualitative systematization of different properties of the 
communication star belongs to a research that is both “quantitative” (numbers) and 
statistic (standard impact value).
It is a special research of magnitude that should be led, for example, by the 
PROMPT consortium and more specifically by UQAM’s Col@b under the direction 
of computer and visualization experts.
5.4  The Future Colab: A Socio-technical Learning System
A socio-technical learning system is a social educational system supported by a 
technical base, infrastructures, middleware, software and tutorials. It is a social 
communication system dedicated to learning and supported by technical means. A 
learning community can be electronically and physically mediatized. A socio-­
technical learning system consists of people communicating with other through 
information and communication technologies. The technological, cognitive and 
social aspects (infrastructures and middleware) represent various autonomous sys-
tems that interact to create a global ecosystem we will model in Sect. 4.5 like con-
ceptual stairs representing various levels of analysis at different tiers of society. 
Systems like UQAM’s Colab are not entirely reduced to their parts or their subsys-
tems, as long as their co-creation does not only involve these distinctive parts but 
also the retroactive complex interaction of the parties on the entire ecosystem and 
vice versa.
There is a double intentionality there that transcends and energizes the entire 
system. This double intentionality feeds and orientates the activities of each compo-
nent of the system even if these intentionalities, in their respective deployment, can 
be in conflict or evolve in a contradictory manner.
Each individual represents a cognitive subsystem like each learning group or 
learning community is an autonomous system of people or citizens in a learning 
situation. A didactic socio-technical system consists of diverse subsystems that, 
instead of cohabiting each on their own, constitute, recreate and regenerate them-
5  Generic Communication and Community Informatics…

127
selves by self-organizing and “self-maintaining” themselves. The community infor-
matics design assistance system (SADC in French) channelled in the Colab, as a 
socio-technical system, is not only a system where cohabit, side by side, a social 
system and a technological system. It is a human activity system, a digital social 
system, where ethics do not come in second after software engineering activities but 
where creativity, educational innovation and ethics contextualize and orientate tech-
nology. Social architecture rearticulates technology and technological architecture 
modules and then rearticulates the cognitive and social dimensions. With this in 
mind, the design of an experimentation framework for the Colab is not limited to the 
application of sociological or didactic principles to a pre-existing technology or the 
application of a software infrastructure on learning various languages. It encom-
passes also the evaluation of the integration mode of technological and social 
aspects in a communicational and socio-didactic system of superior level containing 
emergent and evolutive properties.
5.5  Socio-semiotic, Technical and Pragmatic Levels 
of Didactic Experimentation
The physical systems are not alone in the learning systems’ universe. The terms 
“information systems” and “community information systems” that represent My 
Portal Col@b and the SADC can be supported by several systems definitions. The 
philosophers suggest the idea of system in logical words and the sociologist in the 
social systems, the psychologists suggest the expression of cognitive systems, the 
community informatics expert talks shared objects and their co-construction, while 
economists have their economic systems, programmers their software systems, 
engineers their infrastructure systems and the biologists their physiological system. 
Which of these approaches correspond the best to the co-construction of an experi-
mental validation framework of a universal animated language system? 
Paradoxically, none and all at the same time. None, because each of these approaches 
represents only one way of representing the systems to be built.
There is an entire methodological approach to be put into place around the dou-
ble phenomenon of language and conscience boiling at the heart of the star. The 
explosion of sciences, each in its bubble, is also the explosion of the aesthetical 
conscience, the conscience in its quest for certainty, harmony and truth. The more 
the multiplicity is scattered, the more the conscience explodes into pieces, trying to 
catch up with the Un of these multiples. Human sciences, in particular, ended up 
emptying the human being of his singular substance singular (spiritual essence). 
The human being is dying. It is exploding from everywhere. And the scattered 
pieces of his nature, spread here and there in the particular sciences that plague him, 
make it more and more improbable the difficult reconversion of cultures around a 
central idea of the human.
5.5  Socio-semiotic, Technical and Pragmatic Levels of Didactic Experimentation

128
The Greek antiquity had made wisdom the centre pole towards which all previ-
ous knowledge should culminate. Human wisdom was bowing in front of divine 
wisdom, and theology had supplanted the architectonic science of the being as a 
place of absolute truth governed by the Word of God.
The Renaissance inaugurates the cut between both worlds. And modernity 
accomplishes it by giving rise to the sciences of man next to the sciences of nature. 
This explosion of the concept of Man, without a special status, increases the feeling 
of relativity and opens the way to all sorts of deviances all more powerful than the 
other. Communism proclaims the supremacy of the state and relativizes the indi-
vidual freedom in the name of scientific socialism. Capitalism reverses this relation 
and makes individual freedom the main development line in merchant relations. 
What man are we talking about? For what humanity social, political and technologi-
cal structures governing us are put in place?
Certainly, since this original removal of the symbolic thinking of constraints of 
the instinct and the residual submission of the body to the savage animal appetite, it 
is difficult for the human to unify his conscience. But the quest is always there, more 
present than before in this globalization marching towards the never reached and 
uncertain of the planet and in these new technologies that maybe finally offer the 
human the possibility of reconciling his animal and his spiritual parts. For example, 
the work of transfer technologies between text and animation/visualization should 
consist of offering to singular cultures this double space of reunified knowledge and 
reconciliation of the body’s impulses and values of the mind. As long as this original 
reconciliation is not accomplished, we cannot hope to achieve this unity of the con-
science. The handicap is constitutive of the hybrid nature of the human being, and 
this nature can only be restored in the process framework proper to the liberation of 
the body’s impulses. The “liberated” body can, at the same time, liberate the mind 
from residual constraints that prevent from looking further than these darken reflect 
of the shadows like they appear in the allegory of Plato’s Cave.2 In fact, taking into 
account the body’s space will contribute to its own liberation as well as its mind. 
With the both of them, they will climb the steep hill that leads towards quality of life 
for all and the truth of wisdom that should guide all human intentions of develop-
ment: the maturation of a universal conscience as a survival means.
Therefore we must, at all times during the deployment of the research develop-
ment, be able to establish relations of correspondence and complementarity, conver-
gent or divergent, even contradictory, that allow to find the universal knowledge Un. 
It is in that sense that the equations of the algorithmic and synthetic formulation 
must result in a Un (1), given that the quantitative and qualitative properties of vari-
ous parameters have become complementary and equivalent, beyond their singular 
contents. This result is the necessary and essential condition to allow the conscience 
to finally reach this unit itself, in its endless quest for certainty and truth. Unification 
and correspondence and complementarity transfer’s algorithms must then be 
designed like anthropological and cultural transformation algorithms. There too, we 
will need generations to achieve it, but we must start somewhere.

The visualization of a date base or memory in a digital library only represents a 
facet of such information system. The semiotic and social systems vision is another 
one. It is important in the discovery of the meaning (semantics) according to the 
social vision of the system. All these disciplinary approaches are relevant if each 
can describe an information system in a relevant manner without contradiction with 
the other levels, whether it is the philosopher preoccupied by the system’s ethics or 
aesthetics, the engineer by the performance of the infrastructures, the computer 
expert looking to create friendly interfaces, the biophysiologist concerned with the 
systems’ ergonomics, the psychologist interested in the users’ representation sys-
tem, the sociologist interested in the psychosocial dimension of the uses and inter-
action patterns or the didactic expert attracted by the co-construction of learning 
through network socio-communication and in virtual communities (as digital social 
systems).
Complex systems like the Colab increase the need for a systemic and generic 
approach of the phenomenon we study: the creation of a SADC based on a generic 
model of universal communication in visualization and animation language repre-
sents a good step in that direction.
In order to explain and evaluate the communicational aspects and the use of 
complex solutions like the SADC incorporated in UQAM’s Colab, in compliance 
with the analysis elements of the seven points of the communicational star, we must 
analyse several socio-technical uses’ tiers at different levels of society.
When we do research in communication, particularly when we practise “integra-
tive” studies that combine several disciplines like the complexity, computer and 
evolutive human communication sciences to build systems, we also want to be evo-
lutive; a transdisciplinary approach is required to cover the entire elements involved 
in the seven points of the star. First, the semiotic approach as a logical science of 
sign circulation in society allows to display two analysis continuums, the human 
need ones and the technological solution ones likely to fulfil them. This approach, 
illustrated in Fig. 5.3, allows to see how physical aspects (space, time, acoustics) are 
related to chemical, biological and ecological aspects that start at the bottom of the 
stairs from an informational vision to a communicational/semiotic vision, as we rise 
in the hierarchy of sciences, human and social sciences and the more abstract arts, 
in various contexts at different levels of society with the help of different languages 
allowing the emergence of a collective and collaborative intelligence.
The infrastructure and the software that represent the basis of the socio-technical 
system are located at the first two levels. The third level, biophysical, is there to 
negotiate the ergonomics and ethological aspects on top of intuitive (reflexivity) and 
instinctual (gregarious), communicational aspects and simply to think the place of 
the human in nature through the mediation of these socio-technical systems. The 
human being records his activities in the world not only through technological inno-
vations at the inferior level of the “stairs” but also as a human species that impacts 
the Earth and the world through various games of languages as defined by 
Wittgenstein. Languages allow exchange, content and meaning sharing in the com-
munities. Cognitive sciences, neurology and psycho-physical sciences rely them-
selves on biological disciplines that allow to study the information at a micro-cellular 
5.5  Socio-semiotic, Technical and Pragmatic Levels of Didactic Experimentation

130
level or between living organisms. These have to negotiate cognitive ergonomics or 
bodily issues, psychomotor education, related to the appropriation of messages or 
the sending of contents via diverse communicational signals. The human-computer 
interface systems rely in return on these biophysical aspects related to the brain and 
cognitive needs that reflect to the design of messages, the world representation and 
knowledge to be captured, modeled, coded and decoded.
At the fifth level, we find the sociological aspects of the socio-technical systems 
and the aspects of the social and public communication as well as the global conver-
sation allowed by today’s collaborative platforms and social media. These aspects 
cover other related aspects like ethics, aesthetics, the mind and the evolution of the 
conscience. The next level takes into account the connective networks that, from 
local to international level, cover the new needs created by the participative network 
culture. They account for the evolutive needs related to the community informatics 
design participative culture. The seventh and last level refers to the hyperconnected 
networks (collective and collaborative intelligence), the current and future Internet 
of Things where the needs for innovation and creation are channelled in an evolutive 
design culture we call “ubiquitous imagination”, where the games of natural and 
expert languages are used in the configuration of tools and contents contained in the 
collaborative design of the community informatics type proper to the design soci-
ety: they are “design games” like the ones we find in the adaptation of video games 
put at the service of citizen science, learning and teaching according to the gamifi-
cation principle. The languages used in the identification of current global issues, in 
the resolution of related problems, the imagination used in innovation and the net-
working identity that represents a certain applied consequence (the identics), com-
prise the application of these languages and design games that are massively shared 
to human activities.
The socio-communicational autopoietic system of language games is involved in 
the design of virtual organizations and digital social systems we find in the 
CAPACITÉS model (stairs model 5.2), inspired by the seven points of the star. 
Between the sixth and the seventh level, we add to it, in addition to analysis levels, 
concrete society levels where these “language and design games” are articulated, at 
the micro level (individuals and groups), at the macro level (global networks) and at 
the meso level (virtual organizations). We will need to carry on our researches to 
incorporate them even more, but we believe our demonstration is developed enough 
at this stage to encourage more investigation in this sense. Furthermore, an upcom-
ing book in 2018 entitled Théories des espaces communicationnels hyperconnectés 
will illustrate in part the CAPACITÉS analysis process and its potential for the 
design of social digital systems. A case of application of this chart to a Canadian 
video game enterprise will allow to start the validation.
Figure 5.2 stairs refers to a transdisciplinary analysis chart and a series of questions 
based on the elements of the stars, which are characterized by language and collabora-
tive design games whose updating and implantation require more than technology or 
individual agents. The superior levels transcend the informational design vision to 
suggest a communicational, semantics, social and holistic vision of the analysis and 
design activities that allow a full instantiation of the current socio-­technical systems.

The intersubjectivity related to cognitive worlds also requires the “ubiquitous imagi-
nation “of social and cultural worlds, themselves based on biological and technologi-
cal dimensions of the continuum. It is a fractal model, telescopic even, that combines 
transdisciplinarity, semiotics and functional language of the collaborative design by 
configuration and must be understood as a sort of “universal design grammar” where 
combined and incorporated language and design games become a “pragmatic”, even 
a praxeology put at the service of modeling and the implantation of emancipating 
socio-technical systems. Therefore, the model refers to not only the analysis chart of 
informational and communicational processes associated with socio-technical sys-
tems but also to the design activities collectively realized through means of various 
languages used in the design activities. We dedicate an entire section to this point in 
Chap. 5. The required communication skills for the future of the co-building of these 
new ecosystems that are digital social systems also cover certain computer skills that 
may be fulfilled through diverse stakeholders of the social system to be built (Fig. 5.2).
Indeed to do so, we must take over the communicational star analysis and build 
algorithmic equations according to the quantitative and qualitative criteria of the 
properties of each component (first level of the research). This requires a methodol-
ogy preliminary to the computerization of the system’s various components we call 
“the discovery and strategic alignment matrix”(see Chap. 9). Without going further 
in the programming questions we address in this book, we will now formulate a 
certain number of remarks to describe in more details the socio-dynamic of the 
stairs’ levels hierarchy in connection with the seven points of the star. By doing so, 
we will suggest a series of questions that, in the future, will serve as an analysis 
chart to evaluate and design large-scale socio-technical systems.
For each systems level, we will formulate a questioning allowing to frame the 
algorithmic research with the quantitative and qualitative properties of the global 
system’s components.
	1.	 Infrastructures’ systems are based on physical and material architectures and are 
facing energy exchanges, channel capacities, technological evolution and tech-
nological framework underlying the entire socio-technical system.
How can we improve and consolidate these basic infrastructures? What are they 
made of? How many under components and elements are there in each of 
these components? What happened to the impact values of these main com-
ponents? On which components should we act to make the system more able 
to support and incorporate the multiple and varied innovations of a SADC like 
the one in My Portal Col@b?
	2.	 The software systems emerge from the physical infrastructure physique; they 
rely on various information exchange levels, data, codes and formal languages 
and are facing infinite loops of recursiveness and iteration of the programming 
and processing.
How can we make this software accessible and easy to use? How many function-
alities are there? How many are useful or necessary? How many do we need 
5.5  Socio-semiotic, Technical and Pragmatic Levels of Didactic Experimentation

132
to make the navigation as efficient as possible? How many users are there? 
How many succeed?
	3.	 The bio-physiological systems must face challenges at several levels such as the 
immersive environment, the 3D modeling, the place of the body in the educa-
tional communication, the physical and cognitive ergonomics and the user-­
friendliness, the bio-physiological costs like fatigue, the time devoted to learning 
and integration of the body into the animation, the communication by gesture 
and the communication sensory and perceptual organs.
The Colab and its SADC seek to re-establish the body’s cognitive function 
(semantics and aesthetics). How can we trace the way of this restitution? How 
many steps are there? How can we measure their impact in the ongoing trans-
formation process?
	4.	 The human-computer interface systems (human-computer interaction) emerge 
from the three previous systems and focus on intrapersonal communication, the 
representation of reality and learning worlds, on meaning exchanges between 
two human systems and are facing challenges like information overload, the 
information status at the various systems’ levels and tiers of society, the under-
standing of visual animation language and intercultural comprehension of the 
users.
How can we increase the power of apprehension and comprehension of imagina-
tive intuition and symbolic reason? Does it require exercises and time? How

much? What will be the impact of these exercises on the reason and the ubiq-
uitous imagination? How long will it take (transformation time)?
	5.	 The socio-technical system emerges from the human-computer interface level 
and is based upon the links between the community and communal level, the 
level of normative exchange and the division of labour, and the level of activity 
coordination and collaboration mechanisms between individuals, groups and 
learning communities. It faces problems related to trust, loyalty, faithfulness and 
justice.
How can we increase the communicational exchanges in a context of kindness 
allowing to increase the feeling of security? What are the minimum and maxi-
mum numbers of networks and users? What are the values to implement in 
order to favour security and exchange?
	6.	 The level of computer-mediatized communication focuses on all the other levels, 
but it adds a large-scale international dimension to socio-technical systems like 
the SADC: a link to the entire humanity. It must face the challenge of intercul-
turalism, the learning of the others and the world in the vast digital learning 
social systems and activities related to massive network innovations in the soci-
ety of knowledge sharing.
How can we reach the critical mass constitutive of quantity and quality of the 
diverse components of the network? How can we favour the commitment, 
through which mechanisms or social technologies? How can we mobilize 
great actors’ collectives? According to which values?
	7.	 The level of collective intelligence involves levels of comprehension and intel-
ligibility of the world that go through new paradigms, discoveries and unseen 
emergences.
How can we incorporate the multiples into the Un to concretely catalyse the 
ubiquitous imagination? How many levels of knowledge should we incorpo-
rate? How can we evaluate the quantitative and qualitative properties of these 
different levels of knowledge?
These are the basic questionings we need to refine and make more operational.
Therefore understood, the technology (technè) is made of the dynamic material 
and software infrastructure. The whole organization of the SADC under construc-
tion gathers a research partnership, academic and scholar organizations, computer 
and software applications, people, users and their relations, policies and their busi-
ness models, norms and educational and didactic activities. When we say that the 
Colab/SADC system is a socio-technical system, this implies the seven socio-­
technical levels and their dynamic and evolutive interrelations. Our evaluation chart 
and our experimental protocol will try to ensure the harmonization of the connec-
tions between the infrastructure, the software and the middleware, between the body 
and the gesture, between the cognition and the human-computer interfaces and 
between the social and organizational systems, like the learning communities and 
5.5  Socio-semiotic, Technical and Pragmatic Levels of Didactic Experimentation

the computer-mediatized communication level and the networks at the level of the 
entire humanity and the paradigms emerging from the collective intelligence and 
the ubiquitous imagination (the aspiring intelligence in 5.2).
Since a society embraces more its road system, its people or active organizations, 
the didactic Colab system will emerge as an evolutive social form that will have its 
longevity despite the potential changes that could happen at the individual, com-
municational, didactic or architectural level of its evolution.
The socio-technical system’s levels also include the body, between the software 
informational level and the cognition level. As we have mentioned, this new 
­dimension incorporated into our experimental plan seeks to fulfil a gap in the edu-
cational communication, knowing that in addition to the verbal language, a generic 
communication requires the inclusion of the physical space, the body, the non-ver-
bal language and the gesture in the sensory creation system.
5.6  The Colab/SADC Systems Performance
The highest levels are an efficient way to describe the system but also to operational-
ize it. The stronger the feeling of belonging and identity to a group, the more this 
representation is likely to improve the group’s performance, for example, the acquisi-
tion of a new language. Generally, we define the performance of a didactic system at 
the highest level of productivity. If a level suffers a failure, the surrounding levels also 
suffer from it, like a chain reaction. Likewise, when problems occur in the infrastruc-
ture, they sometimes have repercussions on the software level and so on. Therefore, 
the success of a system depends on all its levels, even the more abstract ones. For 
example, a website with a good infrastructure will not receive any visit if at the soft-
ware and interface level it is full of bugs. Just like we can have technological bugs, a 
socio-technical system will not function if we do not take care of the cognitive, social 
and organizational aspects of its implantation. Even if the infrastructure, software, 
educational applications, social uses or the learning community cohesion failures 
seem different, they all have something in common: if a systems level does not work, 
the entire system runs the risk of failing (internal disintegration). For example, by 
adopting the Internet as a socialization and personalization platform supported by 
cloud computing, we modify the entire socio-technical system; we not only add a 
“human factor in the solution” like we would put a cherry on a sundae.
5.7  The Integration of Reductionism and Socio-
constructivism Challenge
Our analyses reveal that the conflict of representation that seems to exist between the 
constructivism and the reductionism followers seems to essentially result in the fact 
that we consider the level of Fig. 5.3 from the either bottom-up (parts define a whole) 
5  Generic Communication and Community Informatics…

135
or top-down of the system (the whole defines the parts). Constructivist psychologists 
like Piaget (1970), Chomsky (1986), Lemire (2008) and Maturana and Varela (1980, 
1984) state that people “construct” the world and see “one” world instead of “a” 
world, whereas determinists like Watson, Hull (1975), Skinner and Moles (Moles 
and Rohmer 1998) state that the objective world creates real that define behaviour. 
The first ones describe behaviour from the basis, while the others adopt a top-down 
approach. Communication sociology usually considers individual behaviour like 
expression conducts and the sense resulting from external social structures, while 
rejecting the explanations related to the cognitive, biological and physical levels like 
a defective reductionism. These top-down approaches cannot exist in isolation as if, 
somewhere magically, all the representations of a culture and human activity were 
erased the same way it would be possible to eliminate them physically.
We believe this is the heart of the problem. It is the double question of the will-
fulness status: is there a transcendental willfulness (a priori) and relations between

cosmic and human conscience willfulness? The first matrix function of the cosmic 
code poses the cosmic willfulness as a dynamic factor deciding the cohesion of the 
entire system. The second and third matrix functions take over this key factor quan-
titative and qualitative accumulation principle of the transformation to explain the 
status of the human conscience and its disarray regarding the meaning of its own 
trajectory.
It is a key issue, both as a theoretical matter and as a matter of change algorithms 
to be incorporated to technological tools (universal) and sociocultural networks 
(singular) in order to harmonize them in the Un ↔ Multiple. But we prefer not to 
address it here (see Harvey 2018 in reference).
Thankfully, sociology post Luhmanian technique (especially Fuchs and 
Hofkirchner ones, 2013, 2008, 2007) is reconnecting with psychological and cogni-
tive roots with substantial efforts supported by the works of Habermas (1973, 1984) 
with social action and communicational agents; the works of Bourdieu with the 
“habitus” notion, based on the individual perception of the social environment; the 
works of Moles (Moles and Rohmer 1986, 1998; Moles 1990; Moles and Jacobus 
1988) on the micro-psychology of usage (Moles and Rohmer 1976) and the human 
interface operator concept; the works of Giddens (1984) regarding mental models 
supporting the structuration social life; or even the works of Engeström (1999) and 
Wenger (1999) regarding the role of the subject in social learning and practice com-
munities. Furthermore, we take into account today that the emergence of sociology 
from psychology does not automatically imply that sociology can be reduced to 
psychology.
Reciprocally, at any level, reductionist approaches tend to deny the actor’s 
capacity of choice or decisions. For example, behaviourists define all behaviours by 
environmental stimulus or infrastructure contingencies while social determinists 
will tend to say that society articulates the cultural program, that communism or 
market laws (Hayek 1945) define special action from an “individual tabula rasa”, or 
even that “only communication communicates”, as declared by Luhmann (1989, 
1995) when he decrees the social systems primate on cognition and agents’ percep-
tion. The substitution of behaviourist engineering by social engineering can only 
progress with difficulty, to the extent that in those two world visions, the world is 
represented as a machine. Even in physics, no researcher can extract the observer 
outside the equation of the world, outside the cosmic matrix (Audant 2010; Hegel 
2006).
The debate between constructivists and reductionists often incorporates only one 
disciplinary view, but the “emergence” concept allows both the derivation of idea 
and of “new rules”, for example, the biological events derive from quantitative 
events but this does not transform the biology into a subdiscipline of physics. If 
biology coexists with physics, then sociology, communication, cognitive psychol-
ogy, social cognition, computing and software engineering can also collaborate to a 
common creation project of a universal communication and assistance system and 
community informatics design. Instead of reducing all disciplines to only one 
5  Generic Communication and Community Informatics…

137
­reality or world, let us give the possibility to each one to overimpose, modulate itself 
and rearticulate itself, letting the researcher and the designer free to choose their 
point of view. The transdisciplinary borrowing at multiple perspectives (multi-
aspectual design; Harvey 2010) can be perceived as the fact of walking around an 
object to observe and describe it from various angles. The creation of a universal 
communication and design language can greatly benefit from this programmatic 
culture and attitude. This experimental approach reintroduces the notion of freedom 
of choice while definitely abandoning the determinist isolation or reductive ↔disci-
plinary. The creation of a universal communication language that is diagrammatic 
and dynamic involves a vision that is both individualistic and holistic of the human-­
machine language system. But all this shall await a later research.
Thus, the SADC/Colab design and construction spaced can be seen like a physi-
cal infrastructure’s system, an information processing system, a meaning creation 
entity, a world representation cognitive system, a social and community structure 
for educational design and a universal collective and collaborative intelligence sys-
tem. These perspectives do not represent different systems but the desired overlap-
ping of various views of the same hyperspace system integrating different 
interconnected spaces: physical space, cognitive space, social space, cyberspace 
and collective intelligence space. This is why, from the beginning of this chapter, we 
suggest a generic applied communication model that, for now, seems capable of 
better taking into account the complexity of the socio-technical system we wish to 
build.
The SADC catalyses the interaction of all these things and probably more espe-
cially ethics and aesthetics of the collaborative and community informatics infor-
mation systems. For example, it corresponds to a didactic design social space where 
the challenge of creating a universal diagrammatic communication language can 
incorporate a support technology for the creation and generation of dynamics and 
animated (operability and atomization algorithm), to new representation spaces by 
animated language (representation space) and the presentation of live stories or uses 
stories (narrative and story time and processes abstraction) that put in place a new 
type of design, a community informatics design susceptible to validate the emer-
gence of new interactive, technological and social configurations applied to the 
analysis of complex issues and the design of computing and socio-technical solu-
tions oriented towards sustainable development.
Figure 5.3 illustrates this co-creation and co-design communicational process. It 
is a fundamental translation process, one of the natural languages represented by 
information visualization languages and varied psychosocial processes we will 
define later. It is the fundamental constitutive structure of the main components of 
cyclical and iterative processes of transfer technologies Text ↔ Visualization-­
animation tools in the socio-technical ecosystems in transition and evolution.
What are these cycles made of? What are their quantitative and qualitative com-
ponents’ properties? How do they influence themselves mutually in their respective 
deployment? We will continue to try to answer these questions in our future 
researches.

5.8  Socio-technical Systems’ Execution Conditions 
and Communication
Generally, we consider an information system does not have a high output in one or 
more of the following cases:
	1.	 It does not obtain results (ineffective).
	2.	 It is not built for usage (unusable).
	3.	 It contains too many bugs (non-reliable);
	4.	 It is prone to viruses (unsecured).
	5.	 It fails when functions change (inflexible).
	6.	 It cannot be incorporated to existing technological norms (interoperability).
	7.	 It cannot download or import external files, documents and applications 
(connectivity).
	8.	 It reveals sensitive data or personal information (privacy or indiscretion).
These eight elements will help us for the next phase of the demonstration. The 
attribute constellation model for the analysis and interactive construction of stan-
dardized educational technologies (CAPACITÉS) analyses five interdependent ele-
ments of a socio-technical system: the system’s border, its internal structure, its 
effectors, the receptors and the context (the context will be addressed indirectly in 
the present chapter; we will come back to it in more details in this chapter and in our 
next book (Harvey 2018 in reference). The design of each element, according to the 
community informatics design approach (a collective and collaborative understand-
ing of design), consists of reducing the risks and constraints at each level and tier. It 
gives rise to eight basic objectives that we complete with four “contextual” objec-
tives because they help define the educational situation and the specific learning 
environment related to educational activities.
Thus the evaluation of the didactic performance of a socio-technical system like 
the Colab will be done from an experimental framework containing several quanti-
tative and qualitative criteria. On one hand, these integrate risks and, on the other 
hand, perspectives, like in all human artefacts. Here we borrow from the works of 
Whitworth and De Moor (2009b).
	(A)	 The objectives (to define for each project) are related to boundaries. This ele-
ment distinguishes the platform of its environment and its context (the context 
is not necessarily a system).
	1.	 The risk: The protection of the private life or online learning against unde-
sired intrusions, wrong uses and personal or moral threats (security)
	2.	 The perspective: The use of elements exterior from the Colab like outsourc-
ing and cloud computing to improve a multitude of tools and learning 
devices
	(B)	 Structural elements define the internal portal/SADC’s operating.
	3.	 The risk: The longevity of the system’s operability despite the potential 
internal failures (reliability)
5  Generic Communication and Community Informatics…

139
	4.	 The perspective: The systems adaptation to environmental elements (flexi-
bility) and cultural ones (cultural ergonomics) or didactics (new educational 
technologies)
	(C)	 The effector elements seek to directly change the exterior world (e.g. thanks to 
individual or social learning).
	5.	 The risk: The increase of generalized costs of educational communication
	6.	 The perspective: The procurement of generalized utilities for the learning 
point of view, through the increase of direct action possibilities on the 
didactic environment, that is, a positive contribution to desirable socio-­
economic developments or the improvement of the animated language sys-
tem (functionality)
	(D)	 The receptor elements record the “co-creation of data visualization language 
world of knowledge” and receive exterior messages allowing the diagrammatic 
modeling of knowledge, information, culture, ethics and the cosmos (world 
vision and human integration through natural languages of the universe in the 
sensible or rational world).
	7.	 The risk: Management and control of the data recording relative to an entire 
social system of possible and incorporated traceability of the total socio-­
democratic profile of people and social systems (privacy, personal informa-
tion, social control)
	8.	 The perspective: The creation of social and mental learning models that are 
more relevant by using several tools, channels, information networks and 
communications, data, information, cultural elements, ethical criteria and 
world vision sharing with other communities or other didactic systems 
throughout the world
These eight objectives are widely known by experts, but their combination in one 
protocol (experimental transdisciplinary protocol) is something new and still rela-
tively empirically unexploited.
Analysis criteria and priorities vary according to the application context. For 
example, with My Portal Col@b, learning environments already validated by 
educational instances will reduce the importance of security criteria, whereas in 
new or intercultural environment, the questions of information systems ethics and 
the underlying axiology will give primacy to criteria that are relative to security and 
flexibility. The four dynamic criteria (functionality, flexibility, extensibility, con-
nectivity) increase the opportunities, while the four passive criteria (security, reli-
ability, privacy, conviviality) lower the risk (e.g. generalized utilities versus 
generalized costs related to individual and social appropriation of universal com-
munication languages by other languages).
We can hypothesize that the tendency to communicate and act through a new 
didactic protocol and a new language based on information modeling and psycho-
social processes will be even stronger and that the system will both jointly validate 
and evaluate the dynamic and active My Portal Col@b’s objectives.
5.8  Socio-technical Systems’ Execution Conditions and Communication

140
Even if we can think that the “functionality” elements, what the system is capa-
ble of, always have priority, the non-functional requirements of a digital social sys-
tem can have a heavy responsibility in the global system’s operating (all aspects 
related to the context). Not only code lines related to the interface can contain unex-
pected errors, but the entire appropriation context of the platform can depend on the 
actors’ commitment in the use or other contingent factors that go beyond computer 
programming considerations. The code’s strength or the technological characteris-
tics of the tool are not the only factors for success. We too often forget that Esperanto 
is a powerful and universally applicable language, but its massive social appropria-
tion is insignificant. In addition to creating the “code”, we must ensure its social 
appropriation in several users’ communities.
The SADC’s conceptual foundations both suggest the appropriation of an eco-
system and of a techno-system. Current researches in neuroscience, in cognitive 
psychology, in communication and media and in community informatics indicate 
that “virtual thinking space”, as supported by the community informatics design’s 
project and My Portal Col@b, is a guarantee for human cognition validation and 
collective intelligence, which are currently not well understood from social sciences 
as well as natural and engineering sciences. However, a universal pattern communi-
cation language through dynamic visualization can be greatly updated by new types 
of communication and information archival. The “computing technologies”, in 
today’s broad sense (telecommunications, information systems, community infor-
mation systems, social Web, social computing, 3D animation, visualization, anima-
tion and cybermetrics tools), promise to provide a wide array of tools and devices 
that are highly efficient for the creation of a visual, dynamic, emerging and deriva-
tive language capable of facilitating and supporting the human society. CAPACITÉS 
faces a crucial challenge by answering the following question: with which criteria, 
how and until what point can the Colab/SADC platform validate and support social 
and economic appropriation of new communication modes through the generalized 
use of a dynamic and visual information/communication and an animated diagram-
matic language?
CAPACITÉS will then analyse not only the status of material and logical tech-
nology in the co-creation of the system but also the biological, cognitive and social 
aspects that support the creation of the visualization language. We would especially 
like to:
	1.	 Analyse and validate dynamic support functions of the emerging language ele-
ments (inspired by exercises, scripts, routines, representations) at a structural 
level in addition to the traditional analysis of the iconic fauna, animated icons 
and visual sequences.
	2.	 Incorporate elements like the perceptions, the emotions, the representations, etc. 
to the verbal language, and validate the gesture and non-verbal language by try-
ing to anticipate and support the emerging and relevant communication avenues 
through socio-technical systems that support the creation of a universal visual-
ization language dedicated to information.
	3.	 Evaluate the best learning situations through animation language.
5  Generic Communication and Community Informatics…

141
	4.	 Support the evolutive Colab/SADC development in a dynamic process of classes 
and virtual groups in addition to virtual communities’ activities of co-creation 
and interactive processes that put large groups of participants to contributions 
internationally.
5.9  The Colab/SADC Socio-technical Performance Analysis
As we just briefly saw, the complexity of a platform design dedicated to the learning 
of new visualization language assisting the digital social systems’ design increases 
when multiple performance aspects can vary at multiple disciplinary or society lev-
els (Fig. 5.4). For example, reliability can play at the tools’ stability level but also at 
the level of trust between certain software. Each level puts different problems in 
interrelations. For example, the appropriation or conviviality of the platform (costs 
related to use, tendency to communicate or the educational activity), as a conse-
quence, is the reduction of learning time of certain scripts, cognitive costs related to 
the appropriation of a tool or applications, the effort related to cognitive ergonom-
ics, but also the available memory to use the software utility or the available energy 
for the operating of a laptop computer. Once again, all these elements represent 
different challenges for the design, especially when we think that the reliability and 
conviviality dimensions can happen at more than one level.
Figures 5.5 and 5.6 show the different basic elements of CAPACITÉS (see 
Fig. 5.4) as spaces for analysis, design and trial or validation per society levels and 
tiers (Fig. 5.4). Theoretical and methodological details of each of these elements 
will be provided in a later text after their empiric validation is performed by our 
partners. Let us say for now that the compilation of attribute constellations repre-
sents the whole of the systems performance, that the shape of each constellation 
represents the performance profile of a tool or an application or a service and that 
the lines represent the performance tensions between the perspectives and the risks. 
Knowing that the validation of a performance attribute can reduce another, for 
example, and that the increase of the platform flexibility can, in return, threaten its 
reliability.
Figure 6.1 allows to visualize the state of individual and cognitive performance 
in the appropriation of the platform.
For the benefits of the exposé, we present a generic methodology here. However, 
we will show that attribute constellations specific to the didactic experience could 
be created from the following criteria: identifiability, skills, activities, frequencies 
and temporality, communicability, rules and normativity, accessibility to resources 
and users’ profile (Fig. 6.1). Furthermore, we could create validation dimensions 
and criteria to evaluate the satisfaction of users. For example, we could build analy-
sis charts according to the following dimensions:
•	 The content: learning modules, content organization, granularity, education and 
educational scripts

codes and energy, software exchanges computer code and digital information, the 
body exchanges signs, sounds, gestures and images, the human being exchanges 
perceptions and representations by the individual and distributed cognition, com-

munities exchange meanings, knowledge and cultural elements and the networks 
allow the social link and the emergence of new human organization forms and col-
lective intelligence, through diverse animation languages and visualization.
5.10  The Alignment Between Educational Solutions and 
the New Visualization Language Implantation Problems
The alignment between the SADC and My Portal Col@b and the learning objec-
tives by visualization and animation require an evaluative look from the tactical 
point of view to the strategic one at the various levels of the analysis and society. In 
this section, we will expose the problems and general dimensions relative to the 
implantation of various cyber learning systems and techno-educational solutions in 
terms of design. Without exclusively focusing on the particular applications of the 
Colab, we will present a list of criteria serving as relevant examples for the evalua-
tion of many platforms and the construction of indicators. Since we do not precisely 
know all the products and applications to come from the platform, this section is 
destined to give a list of fundamental elements that could help in the decision-­
making regarding the evaluation perspectives to take into account. We try to align 
the best way possible the list of dimensions and criteria on the semio-pragmatic 
communication model (Fig. 5.2) and the CAPACITÉS model (Fig. 5.3), even if we 
are conscious of the fact that we will need to improve the coherence in connection 
with educational objectives to be developed in our community informatics design 
assistance portal. These dimensions are therefore suggested as a reflexive analysis 
chart for the partners as well as for the APSI project: “My Portal Col@b and com-
munity informatics design”. The exercise will consist of determining the indicators 
and criteria that can be grouped under the general particular constellation attribute 
dimensions, taken as an analysis chart to normalize.

	4.	 At the human level, we exchange not only information but also meanings and 
representations so that the functionality at the software level or interfaces is 
replaced by the user’s skills in a creation, innovation or execution task and the 
processing ease is replaced by the bodily, perceptive and cognitive use facility. 
The flexibility and the reliability of the system and its capacity to face changes 
that are effective of the exterior and the interior world are also featured at the 
human factors level. Wealth represents the degree of depth of the conveyed 
meanings, and confidentiality gives the individual the control of his image 
towards other people. Also part of this analysis level is the expansiveness of uses 
and security, which allows to defend against systems infiltration attempts.
	5.	 At the community informatics level, the social Web enable connective networks 
of people. Groups, communities, organization or society exchanges at large are 
done through shared rules, norms, beliefs, memes and culture. The users of a 
social group system or members of a learning community develop synergies if 
the social unit structure obtains more results than if its members would work 
alone. In addition, the participative culture uses codes of ethics or social capital 
when conflicts, aggressiveness or language abuses occur. The capacity of a soci-
ety to show tolerance requires a certain predictability or order from which we 
can judge the acts, while its innovation and re-creation capacity in new social 
space-time require autonomy and freedom. Digital social systems like virtual 
communities need rules to protect personal information in order to protect its 
members from each other. At the same time, they need transparency for people 
to exchange their ideas on “generativity” evolution of the system in the applica-
tions and media services. The openness means that a community lets other mem-
bers of external communities act and inject new values, while identity lays the 
foundations of the communal “us” and the “they”, which suggests a contract or

a constitutive act that prevents non-desirable or not appropriate behaviours com-
ing from the “outside” while defining the belonging to a group and its 
characteristics.
In socio-technical systems like the Colab/SADC portal, it is important to address 
the right evaluation level and the associated factors, knowing that a socio-technical 
design that would not take into account the factors’ diversity could have some unex-
pected consequences. Furthermore, in a socio-technical system devoted to the cre-
ation of a new visualization language, it becomes fundamental and necessary to take 
into account not only community informatics and social factors but also linguistics, 
pragmatic, semantics and semiotics factors:
	1.	 Synergy
	2.	 Ethics
	3.	 Rules
	4.	 Freedom
	5.	 Privacy
	6.	 Openness
	7.	 Transparency
	8.	 Identity
These important factors always incorporate this confrontation-tension dialectical 
between perspectives and risks. The problem the designers, researchers, managers 
and the political leaders are facing in the construction of a platform like a portal 
supporting a SADC is that the attention too specific to a particular factor can 
rebound somewhere else, on another problem. The right design explicitly requires 
innovative synthesis of conflictual goals, dialectical integration of objective often 
contradictory in the total design space (in the seven spaces of the evolutive and 
generative design spiral we have presented in the previous chapters).
5.11  The Conditions and Needs Related to Signification 
Exchange and the Production of Meanings
The human-computer interfaces’ line between connectivity and privacy gives a 
social dimension to socio-technical applications based on meaning exchange. These 
applications emancipate at the community informatics level of the physical space, 
until the entire humanity, through generative and evolutive mechanisms of the col-
lective intelligence.
Most communication exchange theories coming from the computer-mediatized 
communication movement (Harvey 1995; Harvey and Lemire 2001; Turoff and 
Hiltz 1976) suppose the existence of underlying cognitive factors of the appropria-
tion of technical solutions. The first theories were proposing a unique reference 
framework to analyse processes (Huber 1984; Winograd and Flores 1986) that com-
munication between actors already seemed to overflow the simple information

148
exchange. Furthermore, several process theories suggest interesting and relevant 
dichotomy: (1) the tasks versus the socio-emotional aspects, (2) the informational 
versus the normative, (3) the tasks versus the social and (4) the social versus the 
interpersonal. In 2000, Whitworth, Gallupe and McQueen combine these dichoto-
mies by incorporating them in a unique online communication model comprising of 
three exchange processes:
	1.	 The Information Solution: intellectual exchanges of contents originating from 
the literal meaning messages about the world
	2.	 The Relation to Others: the emotional exchanges related to the transmitter-­
receiver context
	3.	 The Representation of the Group: the intuitive exchange on the group position in 
relation to the world and the orientation and movement of the group with respect 
to its own meaning
Figure 5.3 summarizes the way the three meaning exchange processes try to 
interact through the representation of the group’s identity as a first element, the rela-
tions preservation as the second one and problem solving regarding the world as a 
third priority. From it stem three cumulative Internet development stages likely to 
influence, for example, a new animation language universal system.
The First Stage: a global knowledge exchange system
This stage seems to establish itself as the Internet becomes a vast digital library 
containing the entire humanity knowledge in all fields with the help of tools like 
Google, Wikipedia and Vizster as human capacity validation and augmentation 
systems.
The Second Stage: a global interpersonal communication network
This stage is also in motion and in the process of being updated, as people connect 
with other people throughout the world, through all sorts of tools and devices, 
arousing the gradual proxemics law abolition.
The Third Stage: a global community and a planetary brain through the 
emergence of collective and collaborative intelligence supported by the 
ubiquitous imagination of a sustainable society guiding the Internet of Things 
and its cyber-physical social systems
While the development stage is still embryonic, the Internet visionaries maintain 
that when virtual communities come into conflict with other social structures like 
the leadership, democracy and justice, a battle far from being stabilized through 
space and time, few common structures emerge. However, throughout the world, 
multiple initiatives call to mind a sort of global network creativity, likely to produce 
generative alignments and capacities for new never seen before human and social 
configurations with the help of the evolutive community informatics design. It is in 
those human configurations that we see the digital social systems of the future. We 
shall come back to that point later on.

5.12  An Evaluation Framework for Communication Needs: 
The Observation of Socio-digital Media’s Properties
One of the first attempts to classify communication media defines “media’s wealth” 
as a “capacity of the media to facilitate common sense and shared meanings”. 
However, according to us, the studies led in that sector are not conclusive as to 
whether the emergence of sense is related to the transmission capacity or as to the 
users’ preferences when the time comes to transmit the information or knowledge. 
We will need to be attentive to this matter as far as the wealth is not the only factor. 
Other dimensions, like the shared characteristic of information, the synchronous or 
asynchronous characteristic of communication or the degree of communicational 
“continuity” allowed by a given interface, can have some influence.
Other important dimensions must be added to time and space dimensions: the 
communicational connection of a tool depends on the combination of transmitter-­
receiver patterns (one to several, several to several, several to one) and design 
­interactivity patterns. (We will elaborate on the pattern notion in Chap. 6, when we 
discuss instantiation.)
The interlocutor’s socio-communicational position, information and tasks to be 
performed can come from facial expressions, gestures, behaviours and non-verbal 
sounds like grunts and exclamations (2005, Mucchielli 2006).
The computer completes these individual, interpersonal and common communi-
cations by adding and subtracting attitude scales and by spreading them in lines, by 
presenting the statistics and by visualizing them by attribute constellations, by 
semantics differentials (Harvey 2018) and by factor analysis with the support of 
data visualization software.
5.13  A Communicational Reference Framework
In the framework of creating a visualization language communication universal sys-
tem seeking to support the modeling of digital social systems, we are interested in 
the properties that contribute to the semantics wealth of messages; we can define as 
total shared meaning. However, if this perspective aims to evaluate the capacity of 
our SADC to support the task, actions and creation activities of the new language, 
we shall also focus on the system’s capacity to generate innovation beyond the per-
formances related to the task. The task is far from being the only required level of 
evaluation. In several respects, we expect from a SADC that it validates imagina-
tion, promotes creativity, supports the innovation capacity of individuals and groups 
and it opens new perspectives in fields of knowledge not yet demarcated: a collec-
tive intelligence that will guide designers with the objective of allowing creative 
work, nonstructured synthesis and happy and unexpected discoveries that will help 
achieve unprecedented results or acquire the creative skills of collaborative work in 
order to conquer unexplored ubiquitous imagination territories.
5.13  A Communicational Reference Framework

150
First, let us define the communicational framework that could contribute to 
define the semantics wealth, defined as the total shared meaning, in accordance to 
our generic communication model in Fig. 5.1.
	1.	 The Expressiveness: The total meaning at a specific moment, according to the 
number of channels and media wealth:
	(a)	 The Symbolic Position: A simple discreet symbol, an approval or a disap-
proval, is not a language in itself. A public that applauds or votes is a com-
municational symbol.
	(b)	 A Document (structured and static symbols): The textual language is made 
of alphabet symbols, connected with a syntax, translated in the form of sen-
tences that have a meaning. The diagrams have texts or graphemes, gestures 
and “gestèmes” that, according to the principles of the gestalt and the theory 
of action (Moles and Rohmer 1998, 1986; Moles 1990; Moles and Jacobus 
1988), will form significant objects or events in the field of the individual’s 
conscience (psychological space) or in the social fields of the identity com-
munity (social space).
	(c)	 The Sound and Audio-Dynamic Objects: The audio-dynamic communication 
allows the speech, the phonemes to create words and the sequence of the 
sentence. In music, the notes produce melodic and harmonic sequences, a 
polyphony that creates sequences of harmonious and emotional sounds. In the 
audio-dynamic timing, keys and tones translate feelings more expressively.
	(d)	 Multimedia (dynamic multichannel animation): The audio-script visual 
communications intervening in the creation of an animation language open 
multiple creation possibilities through the socio-dynamic of the multi-­
channel. These multiple communicational modalities interact in several 
ways in the ecosystem to optimize the messages’ wealth and the channels’ 
combinatorics, in order to validate the socio-construction activities 
(Engeström 1999) of language world.
At the physical level, expressiveness can be defined as the total capacity of net-
works, the total number of cables connected at once.
	2.	 The Informational and Communicational Continuity: The degree defining to 
what extent do we have continuous flows or pauses:
	(a)	 Continuous communication: The communication flow is continuous, when 
transmitted or received in a way that neither the transmitters nor the receivers 
have content editing problems, or the receiver needs to remember the mes-
sage. From the transmitter’s side, the flow could be unprecedented, sponta-
neous and authentic, while from the receiver’s side, it could be short-­lived. A 
communication flow is called “in real time” when the continuous flow exists 
on the transmission side as well as on the reception side of messages.
	(b)	 The recording: In recorder communication, the receiver is free to memorize the 
incoming communication until he decides to read it, listen to it or visualize it.
At the physical level, the continuous idea is the equivalent to the total length 
of time during which the entire network communicates.
5  Generic Communication and Community Informatics…

151
	3.	 The Connectivity: The number of people sending or receiving communications 
(Harvey 1995) in semantics link networks (Hai Zhuge 2005):
	(a)	 The Broadcast Media: the mass media, from one point to several points
	(b)	 The Interpersonal Media or Self-Media: from point to point, to point zero, 
the communication from self to self or from one individual to another
	(c)	 The inter-Media and Community Informatics: from several to several, multi-­
points, in one single transmission
At the physical level, the connectivity can be done online, wirelessly or by 
radio waves.
	4.	 The Generalized Costs: These costs, explicitly undefined in the present book, 
will be the object of a partner’s decision-making process, from analysis levels as 
well as society levels illustrated in Fig. 5.3, for example:
	(a)	 At the level of creation process alignment of animation language and the 
platform
	(b)	 At the level of the shared meaning exchange
	(c)	 At the level of interpersonal exchange and intrapersonal communication
	(d)	 At the level of the community informatics exchange, its nature and the depth 
of the personal and community contributions
5.14  The Evolutive Generative Design, Generative Alignment 
and Generative Capacity: The Evaluation of Skills 
and Emerging Dimensions in the Future, Colab/SADC
By looking to build a communicational and socio-technical model that evaluates the 
Colab/SADC performance as a complex ecosystem dedicated to creation and learn-
ing a new pragmatic communication theory applied to the community informatics 
design, we have insisted on the fact that our reference framework, mainly commu-
nicational, could not be limited to technology or tasks. In traditional researches on 
information systems (IS) and on community information systems (Whitworth and 
De Moor 2009; De Moor 2005), our focus has been on the performances related to 
the alignment between the communicational star model and the tasks associated to 
design activities in the CAPACITÉS stairs model. The alignment concept, we have 
used a few times in the present text, is often used in a quantitative and qualitative 
evaluation to take into account the way the applications and solutions design 
improves the entire performance of a platform and its value in the broader sense 
(e.g. the one of social design). Until now, documentation on IS has focused its atten-
tion on performance evaluation criteria relying on task efficiency measures as well 
as precision and productivity. This is why we have suggested from the star a socio-­
technical framework based on a generic communicational model in order to incor-
porate in our future experimental plans the evaluation of abstract factors often 
forgotten in concrete analyses, like representations and emotions. A vision of

community information systems like the one the ACIL’s team will update must 
incorporate the human and social factors at several analysis levels. This outs us in 
the vision of an ecosystem where users and designers’ expectations are established 
around the systems’ capacity to favour creativity, to open new visions and to imag-
ine new learning situations in fields of unmapped knowledge by experts’ knowledge 
and traditional disciplines.
The connection of cyberspace ecology and the creation of a dynamic universal 
modeling language of psychosocial processes associated with the community infor-
matics design will generate an invented world where ubiquitous imagination will 
play a big part. Since this world will be co-built with the help of all sorts of tools and 
devices, it was necessary to define a framework for the evaluation of physical, bio-
logical, cognitive, social and networking rules as well as for the exam of the indi-
vidual and collective subjects, static and dynamic objects, design and use activities 
and more complex creation and innovation processes.
To take up this challenge and complete this vision without developing them in 
the present book, we will present here the concept of “systemic generativity”, which 
seems particularly interesting in the development framework of a new universal 
communication system in community informatics design. The generativity concept 
will be all the more useful since it is inspired by diverse disciplines and it will allow 
us to explore the evaluative spaces of the attribute constellations. Like a dynamic 
modeling language is able to map a participatory network activity, that can be seen 
as an illustrated world, a representation of the world inhabited by machines along 
with the movement of human beings in real and virtual space and time, the concept 
of “generativity” will allow us to share and orientate the flow of textual, verbal, 
audiovisual, emotional sensing and perceptual data in collective representations 
channelled in the generative grammar of a new pattern language methodology.
The generativity concept, presented at the collective intelligence level, corre-
sponds to two evolutive generative design perspectives: the generative capacity, 
which translates the skills of an individual or group (innovation) to produce an 
imaginative or ingenious object (ingenious collectivity idea), and the generative 
alignment concept that refers to the enabling degree allowed by an artefact or a 
platform to catalyse these collective imagination results (brain’s alchemy), to com-
municate them and to further favour the generative capacity of individuals and the 
creation community.
In the following pages, we suggest a series of important dimensions we need to 
consider for the analysis of a system’s performance to favour creation, for example, 
at the “linguistic semantic/imagination “level or “the emergence of new linguistics 
and dynamic visual configurations”, and the demand of the alignment with the oper-
ational objectives of My Portal Col@b/SADC project (see the relations between the 
elements of Figs. 5.2 and 5.3), for example, to visualize the beginning of a genera-
tive design guide from the potential functionalities of the Colab/SADC platform.
From this communicational and socio-technical framework, we can now begin to 
define the main concepts in an operational manner, to exhaustively identify the theo-
ries, dimensions and analysis criteria by priority order and according to the most 
desirable action plan and to build analysis charts (questionnaires and observation

tools) useful to modeling and the implantation of such systems. It is a communica-
tional framework awareness that demonstrates the existence of very concrete trans-
disciplinary and communicational avenues, appropriate for digital social systems 
design and likely to accompany in a generative and evolutive way the design and 
instantiation of these ecosystems. In Table 5.1, we outline, as the conclusion of this 
chapter, the complementary plan of a possible alignment between the operational 
performance (potential performance) outlined in Table 3.1 and some relevant theo-
ries on reflection and desirable generative capacities to be put in place in different 
collaborative platforms (Table 5.2).
In the next chapter, we will deepen our exploration of several concepts related to 
the idea of evolutive and generative architecture and to its applicability to social 
digital and socio-technical sciences.

Towards a Scientific Collaborative Design 
Approach: The Construction of a Community 
Informatics Design Assistance System 
to Support Communities and Virtual 
Organizations
Collaborative design has become one of the main challenges in several fields of 
studies, especially social and communication sciences, physics and computer sci-
ences and even biology, architecture and ecosystems of innovation. It is part of the 
future research program in humanities and digital social sciences. Designers want to 
create systems where several entities (organizations and individuals) could collabo-
rate to society projects in an autonomous way, on site and in their sphere of respec-
tive work. Actually this social design process occurs within the collaborative 
network framework. Collaborative design seeks to allow collaborators to work in a 
more efficient way by realizing collaborative actions beyond cultural, disciplinary, 
geographical and temporal barriers. However, for the system to work, we must con-
figure it in order to meet the needs of social requests and changes. According to Lu 
et al. (2007), few disciplines have addressed the collaborative design study rigor-
ously, which remains a field of the occult science or black magic. These authors 
grant we should transform collaborative design in a real discipline, in other words, 
to take it from black magic practiced by very few people to a rigorous discipline 
understood by all (Lu et al. 2007). Researches on collaboration found a strong resis-
tance from the determinist philosophical tradition followers, resistance also coming 
from some misunderstandings created by previous works. We were wondering, for 
example, how to evaluate the human collaboration as an acquired social dexterity if 
we cannot study it scientifically. In other words, it is about presenting a community 
information systems design or to present the general social architecture of a col-
laboration platform, or in brief, the “reference architecture design and methodology 
for open collaboration”. In this case, how to build a collaborative design that allows 
to generate and share the knowledge? According to Wenger and Gervais, design 
does not rely on a simple communication activity:
Here, it is about unifying and coordinating the skills that exist in a practice constellation. 
The design challenge in organizations is not to find the form of skill that conditions all the 
others, but at the contrary, to coordinate multiple forms of skills in the organizational learn-
ing. (Wenger and Gervais 2005, p. 269)

156
The present chapter suggests an outline for the creation of the community informat-
ics ecosystem’s design and suggests a few leads and recommendations. It also pro-
vides a methodological framework, even a multi-methodological one, to support 
virtual environments. In other words, it is about experiencing a community informa-
tion systems design or to present the general architecture of a collaboration software, 
the “reference design for open collaboration”. The community informatics design 
assistance system (SADC) is essentially a framework presenting the adjustable 
design modalities according to the users’ needs. It is the starting point for virtual 
organizations and communities that wish to implement new collaboration solutions. 
As an adjustable socio-collaborative platform, the SADC covers both the community 
informatics design’s scientific bases, the design of virtual communities and the col-
laboration aspects. It links them in order to facilitate the information circulation and 
the access to knowledge and bring closer the users’ communities. To a lesser degree, 
the SADC is also a reference model, a conceptual framework defining a middle 
ground and a common terminology for communication and also, a platform proto-
type of open service, expandable and adaptable for the structuring and integration of 
all sorts of online activities, socio-technical systems, personalized portals and even 
all sorts of collaboration platforms like virtual communities or campuses.
The SADC contains a series of models offering a complete definition of the 
entire essential characteristics of a collaborative work environment. It will be the 
first collaborative design platform in Canada and internationally that will help build 
the design of online socio-technical systems in order to simplify the integration of 
collaborative design activities as well as the evolution of the virtual systems and 
normalization. It will contain the following elements:
	1.	 A governance architecture, containing the general architecture principles and 
general collaborative design strategies like the sharing of resources and the ser-
vice group financing which presumes code of ethics accompanied by norms of 
conduct, commitment and responsibilities.
	2.	 A social architecture, containing collaboration service norms as well as collabo-
ration model that covers organizational aspects in order to support new socio-­
technical or community informatics designers or their virtual environment design 
activities.
	3.	 An information systems architecture that defines a logical framework for the 
deployment of collaboration software that shows how the five different executing 
projects cover the different aspects of social systems design thinking and speci-
fies the interfaces with components like workspaces and Web services.
	4.	 A technical architecture that links the information systems components to the 
underlying applicative framework reflected in the standard reference models for 
the SADC design.
	5.	 A realization architecture that defines the formal and Colab norms and their use 
by different application components. In other words, it questions suggesting a 
new methodological orientation aiming to help designers of these new virtual 
environments (digital social systems) to discover products, applications, func-
tionalities and design assistance devices. We also want to indicate how it is 
­possible to apply the multi-methodological configuration to create reference

architectures to orientate virtual communities taken in an environment that is 
constantly evolving when it comes to collaboration activities, online decision-­
making, problem-solving as well as all sorts of online human activities like 
virtual communities or virtual campuses.
Other works will present an open framework for the SADC updating, thus con-
stituting an iterative process within which the users will submit reviews or sugges-
tions for the produced architecture (online). Thus, they will contribute to the review 
of future publications.
6.1  The SADC’s Vision
The SADC is a reference architecture for the design of collaborative software that 
derives from the seven reflexive and practical spaces of online socio-technical sys-
tems design. These spaces provide frameworks allowing to design the best scenarios 
possible in the life-cycle development of a community informatics design project. 
In the present book, it is a question of developing, in a diagrammatic representation, 
virtual environment designs as well as their exploitation for the community informat-
ics design. The SADC will serve as practice communities’ design activity planning 
according to an ecosystem and communication environment anchored in the socio-
technical systems design associated by computers. This platform will allow the com-
puter community informatics designers to explore the different solutions for the 
co-construction of knowledge and select which ones better meet their needs.
The SADC is before all a cooperation network between a plurality of platforms 
and social systems that seek to facilitate research, innovation and the validation of 
new collaboration technologies in pragmatic environments where stakeholders are 
the co-creators of their own collaboration environment.
The objective of the SADC is to facilitate the exploitation of a virtual platform 
by showing how we can use the software components, adapt them and integrate 
them in different contexts. The SADC intends to link organizations and virtual com-
munities by providing them vast collaboration platforms capable of gathering thou-
sands of users from all over the world by using the user-centred methodology 
promoted by European living labs and other labs focused on research and iterative 
design as well as the evaluation of collaborative supports.
The exploitations by users and virtual organizations are the following:
•	 On a technological plan, guides development and integration within the infra-
structure of existing enterprises and virtual communities
•	 On a socio-economic and socio-technical systems plan, illustrates possible 
technology applications in an array of different scenarios focused on the devel-
opment of project management products:
	1.	 The development of collaborative mechanisms of partnership validation to 
manage the relation with the more promising partners (coordination, concen-
trator, central animation for the concerted choice of collaborative tools)
6.1  The SADC’s Vision

158
	2.	 The selection and development of generic services through the SADC (plat-
form or virtual assistance environment for the digital social systems design 
generic methodology) as a socio-technical design platform of the first SADC, 
to manage the whole of its life cycle
	3.	 The development of mechanisms and cybermetrics, visualization, traceability 
and knowledge management tools that can serve the SADC life-cycle 
development
	4.	 The development of the digital library tools which can be used as memory 
and “patrimonial guide” for the next projects
	5.	 The elaboration of a business model containing the methodology and support 
and service tools
	6.	 The elaboration of necessary marketing tools and branding tools and the com-
mitment of groups and My Portal Col@b communities
	7.	 The integration and development of tools for online animation and project 
coordination
	8.	 The prototyping of a database on knowledge management
After having established the ontological, epistemological, theoretical, methodologi-
cal and applicative formal and semiformal framework for modeling, design and 
implantation of a first SADC as a digital social systems co-creation platform, we 
wish to favour the integration and alignment of the results of the various partners 
and projects in a global and evolutive architecture.
The SADC is not a rigid framework; we can use it in several ways:
•	 A collaboration springboard and a testing ground for users and projects that 
accelerates the implementation of free, punctual and easy-to-use collaboration 
opportunities, as well as the exploration and adoption of a virtual collaboration 
environment for distributed collaborative works (Budweg et al. 2006)
•	 A platform to lead researches and to develop and introduce new technological 
supports for collaboration, as a research location, together with the designers or 
tools and developers of commercial or non-commercial technology providers
•	 The pursuing of a development approach centred on the user, the maintenance of 
continuous communication channels and the exchanges with the user community 
(Appelt et al. 1999)
•	 An incubator for the new digital social systems models stemming from swarm-
ing, to integrate the new partners that use the collaboration and consultation les 
services in specific fields or to develop the functionalities of open-source code

We want to define a community informatics design and formal and semiformal 
reference models including ontology and typology associated with the development 
of all sorts of online human activities and generate collaborative networks and spe-
cialized digital social system divided into sectors or subfields. This operation 
requires a normalization of collaboration software components and interfaces. 
Indeed, by elaborating different models and approaches of soft systems, both to 
build and to accompany the imprecise or incomplete knowledge of social sciences

and cyber communication (digital communication, aspect exploitation), we will 
reach a universal reference framework that will be a model for organizations and 
virtual communities.
In other words, we want to produce the design of a reference architecture that 
will help the enterprises and virtual organizations or users to choose an appropriate 
or relevant collaborative technology that corresponds to their essential preoccupa-
tions. This architecture will allow them to choose a strategic direction that meets 
their business needs and expectations while helping them understand the possibili-
ties offered by collaboration software. To succeed in apprehending collaboration 
technology, we need a user guide or some sort of introduction that allows the users 
to choose the right tool and the right place to start their project or exchanges. This 
requirement is facilitated by the helpers who, thanks to piloting or prototyping, 
provide users with the necessary components for the design process associated with 
new collaborations by facilitating the contribution of stakeholders in the develop-
ment of organizations and virtual communities by also providing training resources. 
First, we must build a SADC that will be used later to build other socio-economic 
virtual communities and other society networking business models, even other 
online human activity systems and other socio-technical systems that we call “digi-
tal social systems” in the service of human being.
Communication between users and technology is made easier by reference archi-
tecture. This offers a middle ground and a basic communication terminology. 
Indeed, it uses terms that are easily understood as well as visual models that are not 
too technical, not for the users nor for the virtual community, without, however, 
ignoring the computing aspect. This strategy should facilitate the establishment of 
trustful relations between the stakeholders.
This architectural platform can also support changes at the organizational and 
management process level by integrating the cost methods and benefits, the analysis 
of the gaps, the modeling of current and future elements, the collaboration param-
eters, mapping and risk management as well as quality control and provide the 
managers with high-level scenarios. Its architecture vision is translated as follows:
	1.	 Establish principles and reference guides that can document licences, architec-
tures, interoperability and solutions security.
	2.	 Establish solid basis of an evolutive and collaborative architecture as well as the 
capacity to migrate new modules and integrate new functionalities.
	3.	 Develop a generic open-source code socio-collaborative architecture that is user-­
friendly, convivial, transferable, transparent, free or very inexpensive and 
high-performance.
	4.	 Develop a reference framework and user guide that is “ready to assemble” that 
will help all the partners to develop their own research, training and development 
services.
	5.	 Define a business model containing experts, students, teachers, the public sector 
and the business community in order to allow the future digital social systems 
development with the right configuration of cognition, network coordination and 
collaboration tools.

	6.	 Establish a tracking chart of tools and institutions and organize adjustment tables 
between tool functionalities and visualization (according to the types of tasks).
	7.	 Define and visualize the roles of all developers.
The SADC project seeks to develop an innovative software platform in order to 
facilitate the creation of collaborative workspaces for users and distributed teams 
for the support of collaborative design and engineering tasks. This software 
platform provides a distributed environment, rich in knowledge, oriented towards 
the users as well as the adaptable and evolutive workspaces on demand, allowing a 
dynamic creation for the users. They will be able to establish efficient partnerships, 
be creative, improve productivity and adopt a more holistic approach of engineered 
products design. The collaborative workspaces integrated at the higher level of the 
software platform constitute virtual meeting locations for problem-solving, conflict 
resolution, knowledge sharing and on-demand access to expert advice. Software 
platforms are designed to facilitate software development while allowing design-
ers and programmers to focus on the characteristics and functionalities of social 
systems and users’ requests instead of worrying about the operating details of a 
system.
6.2  The Design Framework Implementation
We will start by establishing experimental communities in order to collect, link and 
catalogue the information, knowledge and know-how for design and necessary for 
their development, like we will do with a computer expert company. In the remit of 
this task, we will develop and execute the design, thanks to community informatics 
staring by defining the fundamental functional characters of support, the nature of 
basic users as well as the practical and theoretical knowledge captured and recorded 
in the SADC digital library. During the SADC design, we must optimize the condi-
tions of this virtual environment by exploring tools, devices and ICT that support 
the listed design actions and activities and suggest a series of technical orientations 
for its design. More precisely, we will decompose the SADC in four subsystems 
equating to four distinctive interaction spaces: the instrumental space, the commu-
nicational space, the discursive space and the strategic space. In each space, we will 
try to map the respective social action and design categories in a state of progress. 
Accordingly, we will present a new collaborative design paradigm, the community 
informatics design, from which the implantation of a series of social media and Web 
devices that are part of the platform will be guided by social and communicational 
actions as well as by the human activity system the SADC seeks to support and 
accompany in the four interaction spaces.
We want to design a design framework in a reference architecture for collaboration 
software. This framework will be created from the combination of several software 
developed by collaborative space integrated projects (CoSpaces Integrated Project, 
cube ENoLL, Ning, Joomla!, Dokeos software, etc.). The SADC will use various 
6  Towards a Scientific Collaborative Design Approach: The Construction…

161
works performed in the remit of Ecospace and Collaboration@Rural projects and 
other approaches, namely, the construction of worlds. In the creation of the SADC, 
we try to exploit existing software by illustrating diverse ways of using, adapting 
and integrating software components in various contexts to contribute to the construc-
tion of the knowledge world. This platform made of platforms can be exploited by 
user enterprises to meet the goals they had set for themselves. The SADC will contrib-
ute to achieve the following objectives:
•	 Guide, on the technological plan, the development and integration of information 
technology infrastructures within the existing enterprises.
•	 Illustrate the possible technology applications in an array of different scenarios 
for the development of project management products on the commercial plan.
•	 Integrate and adjust the results of different partners and projects in a global evo-
lutive and interoperable architecture.
•	 Standardize the collaboration software components and the interfaces.
Currently, several researches are actively led with the goal of developing 
methodologies and technologies of computer-assisted collaborative systems to 
support designer teams that are geographically scattered, in view of the information 
technologies’ rapid progress. However, we are mostly interested on the innovative 
practices and European living labs because they are centred on the human being. 
We are witnessing a change in paradigm where designers and engineers are not 
alone able to put their works in common at an international level in the context of 
collaborative design, because the users, which have become designers, can now 
closely collaborate with designers. The collaborative design system requires two 
types of capacities and facilities: distribution and collaboration. To support these 
two functions, we must develop and distribute information technologies like the 
Web, Java and XML languages and other technological services built as cyber-physical 
systems (Zhuge 2011; Ning et al. 2016). However, even with the best technologies, 
without a distributed architecture specifically designed to meet the requirements of 
performance and functionality and to establish human-human and human-computer 
links, there can be no effective collaboration. Therefore, by suggesting a reference 
architecture, we can help organizations and virtual communities to choose the tech-
nology and the type of collaboration that corresponds to essential preoccupations as 
well as the strategic orientation that meets their needs and business requirements and 
help them understand the possibilities offered by collaboration software. The suc-
cess of launching a collaboration technology is made easier by helpers, who choose 
the right starting point, for example, with piloting and prototyping, this technology 
provides the necessary components for the design of new collaboration processes, 
it facilitates the stakeholders’ mobilization in the business development and it presents 
itself as a resource for training.
It offers a middle ground and a basic communication terminology; in fact, it uses 
easily understandable terms as well as visual models that are not too technical for 
the user nor for the virtual communities without ignoring the computing aspect. 
Communication between business people, community members and technology is

communication terminology. In fact, it uses easily understandable terms as well as 
visual models that are not too technical for business people without ignoring the 
computing aspect which should facilitate the establishment of trusting relations 
between stakeholders.
This architecture can also support the change management process by incorporat-
ing cost and benefit methods, gap analysis and the state of modeling and collaboration 
parameters, mapping and risk management as well as quality control, while providing 
managers with high-level scenarios.
Collaboration spaces will be developed from a distributed platform of innovative 
software in order to facilitate the creation of collaborative workspaces for users and 
distributed teams for the support of collaborative design and engineering tasks. This 
distributed software platform allows the users to dynamically create an on-demand 
collaborative workspace rich in knowledge, oriented towards the users as well as the 
adaptable and evolutive workspaces features that will be implemented. The users will 
be able to be creative and establish efficient partnerships, improve productivity and 
adopt a more holistic approach of engineered product design. The collaborative 
workspaces integrated at the higher level of the software platform constitute virtual 
meeting locations for problem-solving, conflict resolution, knowledge sharing and 
on-demand access to expert advice.
Software platforms are designed to facilitate software development while allow-
ing designers and programmers to focus on the enterprises’ direction aspects and 
the users’ needs instead of dealing with a work device’s troublesome details. 
Software platforms promote the reuse of all the architectures in a defined applica-
tion field. They establish and optimize architecture of these applications, also in a 
precise field, that allows their reuse in other fields. The implantation of a good plat-
form allows software designers to focus more on the particular current problems of 
a virtual community instead of the underlying infrastructure.
In the SADC, it is known that the collaboration space development within an 
organization or a virtual community requires an adaptation and implementation of 
a reference to work with the existing computing infrastructures, to manage other 
questions and users’ needs and to support the requests for personalized work-
space. It is also important that the reference implementation elaborated by the 
SADC evolves and expands to support additional functionalities and capacities so 
the organizations and virtual communities can understand the implications of new 
systems functionalities and make decisions regarding the adoption of new 
capacities.
6.3  Theoretical Vision
Our idea is to put in place a design theory that helps to better understand how, 
with a complex approach, a communicational complexity approach, it is possible to 
create a communicational design science (or community informatics) at the service of 
socio-technical systems developers, human activity systems supported by technology 
(Fig. 6.1). According to Garnham:

Creating a public access model of the Internet requires non-commodified social spaces. 
Public access models are superior to market and commodity models of media, culture, and 
communication because it provides “all citizens, whatever their wealth of geographical 
location, equal access to a wide range of high-quality entertainment, information and 
education. (Garnham 1990, p. 120)
According to Nigel Cross (1974, 1984, 2001), the will to “scientify” design dates 
back to the 1920s. Buckminster Fuller was the first one to adopt the concept of 
design science, but it is only in 1965 that it was adopted by S. Gregory (1966) in his 
conference on the design method. The notion of design, until now, does not have a 
definition universally accepted by all; it is a polysemous term used by different 
researchers. Depending on the field they are in, it takes on specific properties. 
Nigel Cross tried to identify the frequently used definitions by researchers:
•	 The elaboration of action plans seeking to transform an existing situation into a 
preferred situation (Simon 1960)
•	 The beginning of changes in artificial things (J. Christopher Jones)

•	 The process of inventing physical things that show a new physical order, a new 
organization and a new form, as an answer to function (Christopher Alexander)
•	 The structuring argumentation aiming to resolve “serious problems” (Horst Rittel)
•	 A reflexive conversation with the material in a design situation (Schön 1983)
•	 A democratic and participative procedure (Karl Ehn)
•	 The creation of a complex socio-technical system that helps workers to adapt to 
the uncertain changes and requests of their jobs (Cross 2001)
According to Nigel Cross:
The science of addresses the issue of determination and the categorization of all usual phe-
nomena of systems targeted by design and the design process. The science of design also 
addresses applied knowledge deriving from natural sciences as suitable information for the 
designer’s use. This definition, of course, expands beyond the “scientific design” and 
encompasses the systematic knowledge of des processes and methodology as well as 
scientific-­technological functions of the artefacts design. (Cross 2001, p. 52)
As Imre Horváth supports (Horváth 2001), there is a myriad of texts that reveal a 
scientific reflection effort on the technological odyssey of the cultural communities 
and the practical exploitation of technical design. Researches have also emerged 
from scientific, sociological, government, industrial, historical and technological 
spheres. In general, researchers look more into the fields of target applications like 
architecture, mechanics and electronic engineering, confining the design process to 
problematic zones we find in conceptualization, detailed design, computing support 
and the realized products.
We retain Cross’s idea (2001), supporting that design science refers to an 
approach explicitly organized, rational and completely systematic of design, not 
only for the use of scientific knowledge on the artefacts but also as a scientific activ-
ity in itself. This activity has expanded to collaboration networks to form a scientific 
discipline. It is now a question of collaborative design, collaborative networks that 
allow various autonomous organizational entities to be supported by computing net-
works. Consequently, we must find the preliminary conditions to the construction of 
this new discipline, to quote Luis M. Camarinha-Matos. But what is a scientific 
discipline? According to Camarinha-Matos, a discipline possesses six fundamental 
characteristics: a study centre, a paradigm, reference disciplines, principles and 
practices, a research program as well as a teaching program and a profession 
(Camarinha-Matos and Afsarmanesh 2005).
Several research projects have been performed in this field, and we identify more 
and more practical cases stemming from different forms of collaborative networks 
throughout the world. The implementation of collaborative design is a discipline. As 
a study centre a collaborative network scientific discipline must focus on the struc-
ture, the behaviour and the evolutive dynamic of autonomous entity networks that 
collaborate to better reach the common objectives. This approach must take into 
consideration the principles and practices for the design, the analysis, the simula-
tion, the implementation and the operating of the digital social systems’ central 
nervous system.
A large diversity of collaboration networks has emerged through the last years 
due to the difficulties experienced by the business travellers and scientists worldwide.

The advanced and highly integrated supply chains, the virtual communities and 
organizations, the professional virtual communities, the value constellations and the 
virtual collaboration labs only represent the tip of a major trend in which enterprises 
and professionals are seeking the complementarities and the common activities that 
allow them to participate in competitive business opportunities and innovative 
developments. Similar trends are also found in collaboration networks with lucrative 
purposes or oriented towards social goals (Camarinha-Matos et al. 2005a, b, c).
For Imre Horváth (2001), technical design technique is a discipline in itself since 
it synthesizes new information for the realization of a product. It also establishes the 
quality by the definition of functionality as well as the materialization and the appa-
rition of artefacts, and it has a growing influence on the technological, economical 
and commercial aspects of production. Therefore, the author continues, by generat-
ing knowledge on the design and for the design, this discipline focused on scientific 
research which is decisive in the technical design development.
Therefore, the number of scientific publications on design’s technical aspects has 
significantly increased since 2008 or 2009, while researches on philosophical, episte-
mological and teleological of design research do not seem to be developing that fast. 
Although some authors have conducted investigations on technical design, on several 
fields of interest and on university and industrial research approaches, they could 
not achieve a systematic analysis, confining instead to different reasoning systems. 
The foundation of these assessments varies from the simple chronological principle to 
the phenomenological classification and the contextual taxonomization.
In the case of the SADC (a sort of computer-assisted design destined for social 
sciences and humanities), instead of treating technical problems of the socio-­technical 
design, our book is supported by an investigation centred on the state of the research 
that seeks to establish theoretical foundations, even scientific of the technical platform 
design and the evaluation of cultural, innovative and existing systems. Like in the 
living labs’ methodology, we will apply an approach focused on the reconciliation 
with the human being and technologies. Therefore, we have explored the technical 
design research frontiers by trying to extract, from several studies and theories, a com-
munity informatics design theory through assembling a knowledge corpus and theo-
ries with virtual community co-construction, social systems, activity theories, cultural 
pattern formation and self-organizational emergence as objects. We also present the 
state of progress they have experienced over the past few years.
The main difference between the SADC and the other taxonomical approaches is 
that we introduce a model that allows the users and the virtual communities to iden-
tify the markers of their own development and to stimulate the interactivity and 
creativity of the users. The SADC, like the living labs’ approach, incites users and 
virtual communities to create their own platform by seizing all sorts of experiences 
involving their values, success, best user practices and their own creativity in order 
to create a sustainable platform that will meet their needs. It allowed us not only to 
define a field of discourse but also to explore intrinsic relations between complex 
nature networks, complex institutional and organization networks and the modeling 
of designs oriented towards the community, communication and the dynamic of 
knowledge and practice activities.
6.3  Theoretical Vision

166
So, it is virtual communities whose design corresponds to the socio-technical 
human activity systems we are going to build. We can already see this new design 
assistance systems science looming where a regional and national design is emerg-
ing as well as international social systems networks supported by new languages. 
These new languages will allow to apprehend not only the needs but also the direct 
perceptions, the shared representation, the different aspects of a communication 
combining the sounds and the images, the diagrammatic texts, etc. that will take us 
towards a social mutation more impressive than the invention of telegraphy.
The technical innovations brought by the development of communication and 
information technologies have been too fragmented or incomplete. For example, 
traditionally, the launch of technical products and services was done in a closed 
framework; now there is a deep division between the real market and the users that 
results in gaps of productivity and efficiency at the social and economic level 
(CoreLabs 2007). Digital social systems rise and disappear without even having 
enough time to occupy the social space.
In an attempt to solve this problem, virtual enterprises try to maintain an open 
organizational frontier because we have come to open innovation (Chesbrough 
2003). In fact, we must stay away from the vertical thinking that makes an organiza-
tion manage its R-D activities on itself, in order to find a horizontal way to align 
stakeholders and users in the co-production act (Von Hippel and Thomke 2002). 
Consequently, users are invited to innovate through collaboration. In this scenario, 
users can also be partners or stakeholders of end users. This type of collaboration 
can also be of interest on a more international level, having already been encour-
aged by European initiatives (CoreLabs 2007). These initiatives are at the heart of 
the European Network of Living Labs movement. Their goal is to reinforce and 
increase the innovative capacities within the European states by engaging the user 
in a co-creative manner through the entire innovation process.
Various questions arise regarding leadership, users’ management, partnerships, 
resources, policies and strategies:
•	 Which norms should be implemented to ensure a good governance?
•	 How to provoke users and stakeholders’ creation and inventiveness?
•	 What should I do with my ideas? Who should I address to solve my problems?
•	 Which system providing innovation opportunities can we create within the 
SADC?
•	 What are the available resources to help users to innovate?
•	 What does being creative mean?
•	 How to stimulate innovation?
•	 What are the tools, experiences and methods that better favour the exchange?
6.3.1  Collaborative Network Complexity
The collaborative networks are new complex systems. Taking diverse shapes in the 
different application fields, they consist of multiple facets, and their understanding 
requires the input of several disciplines. In fact, the diverse manifestations of

collaborative networks have been studied by specialists stemming from various 
fields like computer sciences, computer engineering, management, economics, 
sociology, industrial engineering and law only, to name a few. We are now at the 
stage that Kuhn (1975) calls a pre-paradigmatic phase, where the phenomenon of 
collaborative networks is described and interpreted differently in studies according 
to the researcher’s field of activity.
The acceptance of a new paradigm is not a pacific process (Kuhn 1975); sciences 
and paradigms tend to resist the introduction of a new “competitor”, preferring to 
widen the field or the existing science rules to explain new phenomena. This tension 
situation is intensified by the multidisciplinary nature of phenomena, especially in 
the case where a plurality of traditional disciplines of organized knowledge and 
professional are fighting over the mastery of a new field. This is exactly what we are 
observing today in the case of collaborative networks. It remains to be seen if a new 
paradigm will emerge.
In the past, systems design research was mainly founded on the epistemology of 
physical sciences and humanities and on models and theories stemming from the 
general observation of the human behaviour and the processes and observable 
properties of various objects and environments. The new orientation is obvious in 
the growing use of designers’ analysis protocols: there is a change in the construc-
tion of theories exclusively founded on external processes objectively observable 
that now incorporate the knowledge of internal human processes. According to 
Terence Love (2001), there is a substantial change in design research founded on a 
more detailed comprehension of the individual’s functioning and his influence on 
the human interactions between themselves and with objects and environments. For 
his part Andy Dong theorizes design like a cognitive sociocultural system:
One could express this socio-technical view on design by extending […] a commonly 
accepted descriptive definition of design as: the transformation of natural processes and 
the “given world’ through a systematic technical methodology mediated by social processes 
to create an artefact that achieves a set of goals established as a result of designers’ shared 
understanding of the artefact’s function, behavior and structure within a context defined by 
both the natural environment and human interests. (Dong 2004)
Yet, already in the mid-1990s, Love had developed a metatheoretical method to 
analyse the development of theories associated to research on design and more par-
ticularly on systems theories that apprehend the human being in different contexts 
by using various versions that were published regarding the designer, design, cogni-
tion, information systems, electronic education and the inclusion of the social quali-
tative. Nine layers of abstraction forming what Love calls a “theoretical chain” 
emerge from it (Table 6.1).
At the heart of this distinction stands the research founded on the plan that high-
lights the understanding of the insecurity of the real world practice, the context 
being an integral part of the history instead of foreign variables to be trivialized. 
Furthermore, the research founded on the plan implies a certain flexibility in the 
revision of concepts, a plurality of depending variables and the taking into account 
of social interactions. Participants are not considered as “subjects” affected to 
processes but like co-participants to the design and analysis. Finally, research 
highlights the characterization of situations, by opposition to control variables.
6.3  Theoretical Vision

168
Love’s studies (2001, 2003) indicate that systems could greatly benefit from 
human cognition because there is a progression on the development of systems 
theory, where the era of the machine implies sociological epistemology that involves 
cognito-affective human activities. Engeström’s studies on human activities could 
also be a good marker in the modeling and governance architecture. According to 
this author:
Activity systems comprise of the subject: individual/subgroup of the community chosen as 
part of the analysis, tools: physical or methodological, object: problem space or product at 
which the activity is directed and which is transformed into outcomes, community: individu-
als who share the same object, division of labour: division of tasks between members of the 
community, rules: regulations, norms and constraints. (Engeström 1994, p. 237)
Inspired by Love’s hierarchy and his metatheoretical taxonomy of design theories, 
we suggest to make an adaptation of it in ten levels of decreasing abstraction, in 
order to illustrate certain relevant theories of the community informatics design 
applied to digital social systems (an adaptation of Love 2001). The table below 
illustrates the evolution of disciplines and a way to model them in a more systematic 
manner to choose the most relevant ones (Table 6.2).

can also be formal depending on the situation, the field and the culture, the 
type of artefact, the architecture scenario, the events and circumstances

Inspired by Love’s hierarchy, we suggest a general modeling framework contain-
ing multiple criteria for the optimal design of digital social systems. This well-
adapted framework favours the comprehension of disciplines and theories likely to 
inspire the design of ecosystems and platforms stemming from uncertain and socio-
dynamic socio-technical environments. The choice of the theoretical approach to 
use relies on the aggregation of preference cognitive and functional functions that 
serve as design and base criteria for the decision-making in the mass of knowledge. 
These criteria help social systems’ designers to optimize the use of theories and 
researches that are relevant to their projects. It is in that context that our lab has 
developed a theoretical and methodological modeling tool, inspired by Love’s hier-
archy and Banathy and Lemire’s works (2008) in epistemology and with the basic 
principle of observation and evolution of disciplines according to three types of 
ontological elements to evaluate:
	1.	 The objects and the results of the research (material aspects, tools, architectures)
	2.	 The actors involved in the co-creation process and the evolutive life cycle of 
projects
	3.	 The actions and activities, by profession and by fields, the organization of theories, 
communication and design process theories
Figure 6.2 illustrates this tool and processes that are associated to it. Taking into 
account the three fields of knowledge allows to evaluate the fields and relevant 
theories in various design projects.
Furthermore, the design criteria founded on reliability serve as reassurance for 
users and virtual communities about the structural security characteristics in view of 
uncertainties in modeling and seismic charges a social system can be subjected to dur-
ing its life cycle. We talk about the chaos and the demands of the code, which are also 
easy to incorporate in this optimal process design. The methodology is illustrated by 
a simple example: a three-platform SADC design which overlays the open collabora-
tion reference architecture, the integrated information reference infrastructure and 
the technical reference model, according to the conceptual framework architecture 
of The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF).
A platform is presented in the form of a steel structure building for which the 
uncertainty of the ground movement is characterized by a probabilist answer of the 
spectrum that is developed from available attenuation formulas and seismic eventu-
ality models. To paraphrase an article published in the Health Economics journal 
(Zweifel et al. 1999) fundamental design research is not a series of approaches with 
the intention to produce new theories, artefacts and practices that have repercus-
sions on the learning and teaching in a natural environment. Like Cobb and his col-
leagues explain:
Prototypically, design experiments entail both “engineering” particular forms of learning 
and systematically studying those forms of learning within the context defined by the means 
of supporting them. This designed context is subject to test and revision, and the successive 
iterations that result play a role similar to that of systematic variation in experiments. 
(Cobb et al. 2003, p. 9)

design. It semi-formally habilitate the designer to study the Objects (technologies

and artefacts), Actors (partnership helix and stakeholders) and Actions (human 
activity systems). It also enables us to evaluate the approaches, codes, theories to 
build new sociotechnical systems in an open and evolutionary way.
Collaboration is an applied field, and collaborative design researchers try to add 
to their program the apprehension of design technologies by trying to reproduce 
precise results such as the increase of user and stakeholder participation in the pro-
duction of science, the creation of online communities for professional improve-
ment, the design of organizations and virtual communities or the solving of 
management problems associated with preexisting users or community members’ 
beliefs. For this reason, the SADC researchers have observed that in order to have 
an appropriate collaboration, we must develop technological tools, programs and 
mostly theories that help understand them and systematically predict the way the 
collaboration is executed. This research on virtual community design offers several 
advantages: research results that take into account the role of the social context and 
that have a good potential for influencing collaborative practice, tangible products, 
programs likely to be adopted elsewhere and a validation of results according to the 
use effects (Messick 1992).

6.3.2  Systems Thinking and the SADC
The phenomenon of collaborative social systems is not new. Many organizations 
and enterprises rise and disappear, while others greatly succeed. On our part, we 
will study what contributed to the success of certain organizations and the failure of 
some others. According to our research, several critical factors explain the success 
and prosperity of virtual organizations. These factors touch upon trust, the commit-
ment of members in the innovation process, access to appropriate information and 
cutting-edge technology, adapted methodologies and updates as well as good gov-
ernance. In this context, the SADC, in terms of various interdependent and comple-
mentary objects, feeds a collaboration mechanism in a framework of a distributed 
systems design architecture with the objective of satisfying the performance and 
functionality’s requirements. Of course, there are several researches currently ongo-
ing on collaborative design, but with the SADC, we want to develop a system and 
methodology prototype able to support any organization. This research will lead to 
a mutual comprehension of systems thinking and co-laboratory design, as well as 
the learning of reflection processes in place.
Systems thinking is a process that seeks the comprehension of the social 
systems’ functioning mode. We consider design like a way to rethink virtual orga-
nization support environments and to make it a launching pad for the collectivity’s 
prosperity in order to reinforce the entrepreneurship capacities and to promote a 
continuous sustainable improvement. The SADC is founded on systems thinking. It 
encourages the collaboration systems reflection, the innovation thinking, the strate-
gic discovery and processes. Systems thinking, according to Checkland (1988), is a 
holistic analysis approach that focuses on constitutive elements of a system in cor-
relation with the systems functioning in time and in larger systems framework. By 
supporting our SADC’s design on a multidisciplinary and collective approach with 
the help of the grounded theory, the research action and the associated reflection of 
experimental research, we will be able to contribute to a new innovative thinking. 
Let us mention that an innovative thinking is linked to creative thinking and 
problem-­solving, meaning the ability to manage a new thing or to find new ways to 
solve problems. We find several elements in the design thinking:
•	 Collaborative thinking includes the multidisciplinary thinking and collective 
intelligence.
•	 Innovative thinking that encompasses performance, communities and chains of 
values.
•	 The discovery, used by critical thinking, anchored theory, action research and 
experimental approach.
•	 The treatment that encompasses work flow, architecture, reflection in real time, 
risks, efficiency, maturity and information services.
•	 Strategic thinking refers to control, cause-to-effect relations and finality 
(Bertalanffy 1968).
6.3  Theoretical Vision

174
The SADC calls on theoretical points of view and multiple research paradigms in 
order to build understanding of nature and learning conditions, cognition, collabora-
tion and development. In the collaboration context, it emphasizes the way users col-
laborate. The design of this framework implies the development of technological 
tools, programs and mostly theories that will help understand and support the collabo-
ration process. Furthermore, several researches show that collaboration, cognition, 
knowledge and context are irreducibly co-built, iterative and inseparable.
In his model focused on cognition, Hutchins (1995) draws a design theory like a 
“contextualized action model” that focuses on the emerging behaviour of human 
activity. Wertsch (1991), on his part, suggests an approach of distributed cognition 
that makes the examination of people, objects and tools they use necessary as well 
as the social organization factors influencing the cognition. The mediatized action 
theory delimits the reciprocity between agents (actions) and their tools (Fig. 6.3).
Let us remember the main objective of the SADC: Be a design platform for other 
platforms; serve as an assistant framework for social services design; and contribute the 
longevity, the quality and efficiency of virtual organizations. As a whole, we intend to:
•	 Create a platform for learning and exchange.
•	 Allow users and virtual communities to experiment.
•	 Support collaboration and visualization of activities.
•	 Use an approach founded on participative research action.
These platforms will be transformed into knowledge and exemplary practice 
springboard that will help to improve human cognition and extract fundamental 
problems and complex systems comprehension. The discovery process is supported 
by research process critical analyses.
6.3.2.1  Basic Concepts
Reference architecture1 provides a proven solution model for the architecture of a 
particular field. It also suggests a common vocabulary to discuss the pooling, often 
with the objective of emphasizing standardization. A reference architecture is often

comprised of a list of function and indications relative to their programming 
interfaces as well as their mutual interactions and with the external functions of the 
reference architecture.
Reference architectures can be defined at various levels of abstraction. At the 
most abstract level, a communication network links diverse pieces of equipment and 
each one offers different functions. At an inferior level, an architecture could, 
for example, illustrate interactions between procedures (or methods) of a given 
computer program during the execution of a very precise task.
Reference architecture provides a model that often relies on the generalization 
of efficient solutions. These solutions were generalized and structured for the repre-
sentation of an architecture both logically and physically founded on the exploitation 
of models that describe observations in a certain number or successful realizations. 
Furthermore, it shows the way to compose these pieces to form a solution. Each 
reference architecture is applicable to a particular field or project.
The reference model2 is provided with a taxonomy and a generic vocabulary and 
is universally applicable. A reference model is also a basic architecture. A reference 
architecture emphasizes more on the utility than the absolute and universal validity; 
it can contain concrete and specialized contents, like component samples, processes 
and services catalogues. The relevant reference models, like the technical reference 
model (Ning, Joomla!, Dokeos), the reference models for integrated information 
infrastructure, interconnection open systems and distributed processing open models, 
must, however, rely on a reference architecture.
The collaborative network regroups, according to Frans M. van Eijnatten, “self-organizing 
multidisciplinary cyber teams of heterogeneous human agents (individuals, groups, organiza-
tions) from different networks that intensely interact with each other – mainly through the 
Internet – in order to reach a common goal”. (Van Eijnatten 2005)

In this chapter, we present the reference architecture for collaboration systems. 
This model can be used by enterprises for the construction of their own collaboration 
architecture, by selecting and widening the reference content. This model is based 
upon proven technological solutions, used at the Centre de Communication Adaptée 
de Montréal (CCA) and the ACIL, a band council, etc.

6.4  Methodologies
6.4.1  A Methodology to Apprehend Community Informatics 
Design
We did draw from several studies performed in the field of education elements that 
confirm the importance of community informatics design by trying to place it within 
the methodological paradigm to try to investigate relations between individuals, 
groups, learning environments and technological innovations in setting an educa-
tional designer (Barab and Squire 2004). The community informatics design field is 
a new discipline; therefore, it requires a method or a theory allowing users to appre-
hend design well. In fact, we must put in place a methodology that is favourable to 
collaboration, co-construction, design and innovation. By relying on adapted infra-
structures and methodologies, the SADC (as a platform of design of other design 
platforms) enlists a great number of users from the phase of products and services 
design instead of only at their validation level. It benefits from talent pools, cultural 
creativity and diversity form different virtual organizations and groups seeking to 
better validate potentialities linked to users’ inventiveness and imagination. By 
going beyond the traditional use of platform, it must allow to adapt in real time the 
design of new products and new services.
We have used several cases that utilize varied methodologies. In the SADC con-
struction, it is crucial to have a global methodology that ensures its longevity. To 
start, we gave ourselves a reference framework in order to crystallize our reflections 
on the appropriation of social systems on issues related to the evolution of the 
SADC, its creation and its longevity. As we previously mentioned, the SADC is 
above all a set of complex socio-technical systems involving several objects and 
components in dynamic interaction that give rise to various levels of communica-
tion requiring common behaviours in the appropriation. Consequently, we are deal-
ing with transdisciplinary concepts that, through various types of socio-technical 
systems, scales of observation and different disciplines, end up creating a desirable 
design. This design meets the requirements of Bela Banathy (2000) to rehabilitate 
the man at the heart of the action.
6.4.2  ENoLL’s Cube Method and European Living 
Laboratories
This methodology allows to regroup in a coherent whole various tools and necessary 
methods for a maximal use of the SADC. This model (Fig. 6.4) was originally 
named Living Lab Harmonization Cube, but the APSI/Colab project team preferred 
to name it “ENoLL’s cube”. We will get inspired by it in part to build our SADC. 
6.4  Methodologies

180
Since the living labs use a multidisciplinary and open approach and they have 
proven their effectiveness in several fields, with projects like e-Inclusion, direct 
democracy and the participation, we believe it plays a vital role in our design 
approach of services for citizens, virtual organizations and any social group that 
wishes to evolve, interact and represent itself within social systems.

6  Towards a Scientific Collaborative Design Approach: The Construction…

181
We find in the ENoLL cube method three primordial phases: the creation and the 
implementation of the living lab that allows to note the essential points before 
starting, the durability in order to make the approach durable and the extensibility 
that consists of considering from the start the future development of the lab.
The three columns of the cube correspond to the basic notions that form the 
whole of collaborative platform fundamental problems: the organizational, contextual 
and technological aspects. The co-creation and collaboration processes are covered 
in the organizational aspects. The co-construction of knowledge, generations of new 
ideas and new implementation strategies of services or products resulting from it are 
addressed in the contextual aspects. Finally, comes the development of technolo-
gies and design assistance systems that favour collaboration between different 
stakeholders (Mulder et al. 2008).
In the living lab experience, each partner or each stakeholder uses six main 
components in order to determine the roadmap and the needs which allow all to 
have a global vision of the challenges to face in order to move forwards.
However, we cannot neglect the users’ participation, considered as a key element 
of the living lab; in fact, the users are at the heart of this concept. We must know 
how to both involve and motivate, gain their trust, collect and synthesize their ideas 
and measure their activity. According to Baecker et al. (1995), if the traditional

decor favours spontaneity and realism of meetings in a specific time, the virtual 
decor mostly depends on groupware that also gives flexibility and spontaneity to 
interactions. To succeed in including users in an innovative co-creation process, we 
must stimulate the discussion and the creativity. Furthermore, it is important for the 
participants to be sufficiently varied to stimulate the discussion and the creativity 
while avoiding points of view that are too contradictory and could provoke a slow-
down of the exchange or the experience (Bloor et al. 2001). However, a great users’ 
participation depends on the dynamism of the group; therefore, the participants 
must be diversified in order to stimulate the discussion. It is not rare that the genera-
tion of ideas and concepts is intergraded in the discussion group to reinforce the 
creativity of the participants or to draw, by using examples of what is seen in terms 
of methods like brainstorm and the construction of scenarios (Bloor et al. 2001).
To ensure the SADC’s durability, we must ensure the users’ participation. 
Consequently, it is important to develop a system that takes into account the degree of 
the daily activity of users, for example, by using indicators that discretely evaluate the 
use of technology by the users. In the SADC, since we focus on the role of the user at 
the heart of the system, we must go beyond traditional approaches and find motivating 
elements that arouse an active users’ participation in their social networks. A way to 
proceed consists of provoking a feeling of belonging for users, to establish an atmo-
sphere that stimulates exchanges. For example, in the Colab case, we will find a way to 
share good practices and experiences in the field and foresee regular meeting and 
exchange moments according to precise modalities. This is how we manage to main-
tain a real circulation of ideas and give life to the community (Fig. 6.5).
At the same time, we must process the organizational aspects that might compro-
mise the durability or longevity of the SADC. In this case, how can we motivate the 
users to participate in the co-creation process? We must not only find technological 
tools that are easy to use but also reassure the users regarding the confidentiality of 
their transactions and the respect of the private sphere. We must also take into 
account the use of social networks and the impact measuring tools have on users 
while taking into account the legal and cultural differences. Since the SADC is des-
tined to serve as a framework for social systems networks beyond geographic con-
fluences, we must take into account the cultural perspectives and relativism. These 
aspects will be addressed in the context of governance, which talks about manage-
ment, roles and ethics. Finally, the technological tools used by users for collecting 
data must be the object of great attention during the construction of the SADC.
In order to create a favourable setting for exchanges and engage the users, it is 
primordial to define their objectives and their expectations regarding the SADC, so 
we must organize discussion groups and initial workshops with the potential part-
ners to precise the expectations of each one of these partners, the efforts we demand 
and the form of their potential commitment. Another aspect is found in the feedback 
that could promote an iterative process of experienced lived within virtual commu-
nities. Besides, regarding the user’s motivation, we must be on the lookout for 
technologies by constantly ensuring the collaborative tools are relevant and they 
meet the users’ needs. In our initial workshops, we have asked the participants to 
elaborate a conceptual map of their current employment and technologies. It is 
important to suggest and to develop tools that will serve to vitalize the SADC’s life.

At the beginning, the SADC reference architecture content has been selected 
according to the needs of users, researchers and technology providers of the project. 
A pragmatic approach has been adopted. Various established or in-progress work 
platforms like Moodle or Sakkhai or the learning content management systems 
(LCMS) were discarded because of their complexity, restrictiveness and orientation 
on exclusive enterprise architectures instead of general reference architectures and 
also because they do not focus enough on collaborative technologies. Instead of 
that, we have followed the methodology established by Dokeos, the European living 
lab communities and CoSpaces, and we are determining the questions the architecture 
must answer and the contents to be included.

6.5  The SADC Principles: Its Visions and Requirements
In this section touching upon the governance architecture, we will present the 
general motivations and underlying principles for the implementation of the SADC 
collaboration systems.
The European living lab designers have built platforms that allow to consolidate 
and reinforce the innovative capacities of their labs, by taking into account, however, 
the principles that ensure its longevity: continuity, openness, realism, users’ capaci-
tation and spontaneity. For these designers, continuity plays a crucial role on the 
maintenance of collaborations between users and organizations; it allows to develop 
trusting relations allowing the associate and the users to accumulate knowledge 
together. The creation of open frameworks promotes the innovation process in the 
sense that users feel free to develop ideas and take on social or commercial adven-
tures everywhere they are. According to living lab designers, stakeholders must 
design this type of lab like a natural or realist environment where users are placed 
in the context of a real and authentic life experience. In addition, motivated and 
stimulated users participate more in the innovation process. Furthermore, the living 
lab must also be equipped with the capacity to detect users’ reactions and take into 
account the input resulting from the entire innovation process and stakeholders 
instead on the users input only:
The Living Lab approach enables the user to be a part of the whole innovation process by 
incorporating a wide range of methods for user involvement. These take place both in tra-
ditional face-to-face settings such as focus groups and workshops and in virtual settings 
supported by distributed tools. The virtual settings also enable the Living Lab to reach a 
bigger community. (Schumacher and Feurstein 2007)
In order to meet the SADC objectives, the partners have determined it would be 
efficient to start with a set of common principles and pragmatic expectations related 
to this architecture. The following directive principles were recognized as essential 
to the development of a practical and useful architecture, acceptable both by orga-
nizations and virtual communities and by those who perform the in-depth researches 
on collaboration technologies. For example, any community or virtual organization 
must be equipped with a service policy which is a declaration related to the obliga-
tions, constraints and other conditions of the platform use by users. Furthermore, 
any architecture should have as a precise goal the increase of the efficiency of the 
effort and the utility of the description resulting from it. The goal determines the 
impact, which leads the definition of characteristics, the delays and the require-
ments related to the data as well as the level of detail or granularity. It must be 
aligned with the priorities of the community and contribute to the success of its 
mission’s objectives.
This principle is also applied to the description of an architecture in its whole or 
a part of it or a view of an architecture. It also applies to architecture groups within 
a federation or an enterprise. For example, it will be easier to compare architectures 
built by different research projects in evaluation of the office work if, from start to 
finish, they are all built with this comparison spirit.
6  Towards a Scientific Collaborative Design Approach: The Construction…

185
Any virtual architecture that is sustainable must be simple, direct and easy to 
understand. Without pretending exhaustiveness, we present here a few principles 
that contribute to ensure the longevity of an architecture.
6.5.1  A Simple and Direct Architecture
The development of an architecture that is too complex consumes a lot of time and 
money. It is better to pay special attention to the determination at the appropriate 
detail level to meet the desired objectives of the architecture design effort. We will 
take into consideration:
•	 The evaluation of the architecture impact
•	 The levels of the architecture decomposition
•	 The specificity levels in the definition of elements data architecture
In the first version of the SADC architecture, the essential architecture elements 
were identified; the next versions will provide additional elements given the experi-
ence acquired by working with industrial partners in the living labs and virtual com-
munity and organization setting.
6.5.2  An Architecture Well-Understood by Users
The architecture must be understandable to reinforce the applicability of information 
between its users. It must guide the process of human thinking in the discovery, the 
analysis and the problem-solving in order for designers (architects) and analysts to 
understand the issues quickly. The architecture must represent the information clearly 
by using common terms and definitions and by avoiding superfluous information.
6.5.3  Interoperability in the Entire Enterprise
The architecture must be expressive, by using a standard vocabulary with a clear 
semantics and a well-defined structure, to allow the comparability of data and the 
interoperability with other architectures of the same industrial enterprise or virtual 
organization. The application of this principle resorts to a set of common architec-
tural construction elements or reference documents as a base for the architecture 
description. It is also essential that the architecture descriptions clearly define the 
external interfaces with other technologies and commercial components, in a coher-
ent way with the method used to describe internal relations. This common basis for 
the development ensures the use of similar formats to display the information which 
allows the integration, the federation, the comparison and the reuse of disparate 
architectures.
6.5  The SADC Principles: Its Visions and Requirements

186
6.5.4  Flexibility
The architecture must be modular, reusable and decomposable to reach a level of 
desirable flexibility. The architecture description is preferably composed of con-
nected pieces that can be rearranged with a minimum of adaptation, allowing a 
multiple purpose use. A flexible architecture gives its users the means to function in 
a dynamic environment.
6.5.5  The Architecture’s Vision
The architecture’s vision of the SADC is taken from the CoSpaces technical objec-
tive, the creation of an innovative and distributed software framework facilitating 
collaborative work and the diffusion of workers and teams’ knowledge in order to 
support collaborative design and engineering tasks. The software framework allows 
users to practice a dynamic creation in distributed collaborative work environments, 
modifiable (variable or expendable), rich in knowledge, oriented towards workers 
and available on demand in a way to establish efficient partnerships that can col-
laborate, show creativity and improve their productivity as well as adopt a holistic 
approach of the product phase implementation. These interactive work and collabo-
ration environments become virtual meeting points for problem-solving, dispute 
resolution knowledge exchange and on-demand access to expert advice. These 
spaces offer a transparent and natural collaboration between workers and distributed 
knowledge teams. They are founded on an evolved communication, simulation 
services, knowledge support, innovative visualization and natural interaction; they 
offer a sufficient level of security, and they contribute to transform the current work 
practices to promote competitiveness of the entity on the global market.
The challenges to face are numerous in the sense where the architecture must 
allow the collaboration at multiple levels within the organization. In this case, we 
have to address the complexity of design by building a collaboration architecture to 
avoid errors and that could be costly in the design process. According to Huang 
et al. (2010), eight main aspects are likely to have a strong influence on a platform 
construction:
	1.	 The capacity of adaptation to change or failures that occurred within the archi-
tecture network
	2.	 The heterogeneous platforms’ conviviality functioning on different exploitation 
systems
	3.	 The semantics interoperability or the use of heterogeneous languages by differ-
ent agents
	4.	 The capacity to transmit the messages and modify the data (in relation with 
semantics interoperability)
	5.	 A quick configuration of the implementation of the product’s environment (tak-
ing into account the delays, the calendar, etc.)
6  Towards a Scientific Collaborative Design Approach: The Construction…

187
	6.	 The decrease of incidences of a service agent change
	7.	 The preparation to a potential expansion
	8.	 The preparation to the gaps in the information processing (Huang et al. 2010)
These elements can serve as a control list for the development of a reference 
architecture which is considered as a way to integrate criteria and collaboration 
requests to the planning process.
6.5.6  The Technological Strategy
The Office of Community and Rural Affairs (OCRA) technological strategy relies 
on an architecture oriented towards services (AOS). The AOS is an approach of 
enterprise architecture and distributed computing that allows to outsource oneself in 
functional applications at the local level and thanks to remote available services. 
More specifically, the AOS is an architectural style that guides all aspects of cre-
ation and procedure uses, presented like services all through their life cycles as well 
as the definition and supply of the computing infrastructure that allows the different 
applications to exchange data and to participate in the procedure, independently of 
the exploitation systems or the original programming language.
The AOS provides a general model, used by architects, whose functionality is 
decomposed into small distinct units (services) that can be distributed on a network or 
combined and reused to create commercial applications. These services communicate 
with each other through data from one service to another or through a coordination 
activity between two or several services. The SADC follows the AOS services and 
uses the AOS modeling to describe the different aspects or architecture views.
6.5.7  Social Systems Strategy
It is obvious that the commercial strategies are specific to each enterprise. 
However, we include certain general strategies to our reference architecture, like 
common examples of reasons to modernize the collaboration support infrastructure. 
The globalization of industrial activities is at the origin of the migration of design 
activities and production throughout the world, in order to optimize the logistics 
and the supply chain and to differentiate the product according to the needs and 
regulations of each market.
Consequently, the engineering sectors in Europe now endure strong pressures to 
reduce the delay of commercialization of new products and improve their quality, 
the clientele reaction and the market reactivity regarding the overseas enterprises 
with important shares in the European market, which reinforces competition. 
However, globalization offers European manufactures new possibilities to expand 
their activities in emerging countries where the current European Union penetration 
is limited to niche products.
6.5  The SADC Principles: Its Visions and Requirements

188
The deconstruction strategies and emphasis on basic skills in place by the orga-
nizations and virtual communities promote the growth of virtual distribution enter-
prises. Through the last years, we have changed through an organization focused on 
discipline (based on the different services of a desk study) to a process (or program) 
more flexible based on the organization. In this context, people from several disci-
plines are gathered in co-located platforms (the product of integrated teams) with 
the representative of the production and the technical support through the product 
development phase. In the future, because of the great reactivity to the market 
demands and to get to another important step in terms of costs, cycle type and qual-
ity, it has become necessary to get orientated towards a more flexible and adaptable 
type of organization. In this organization, the engineering process is shared between 
the various teams of knowledge in a linked network. This considered organization 
requires punctual collaboration activities, a strong control and supervision system 
and appropriate and interdependent working spaces for each type of engineering or 
design activity.
6.5.8  Social Systems Objectives
The partners of the aeronautics and automotive industries in the design of collabora-
tive spaces have underlined several general objectives in a collaboration architec-
ture (Table 6.3):
6.5.9  The Stakeholders
The design of a stakeholders’ card is to identify the commitment architecture’s 
stakeholders, precise their influence in commitment and highlight questions, issues 
and preoccupations that need to be addressed in the architecture framework. In a 
reference architecture, it is favourable to stay focused on the identification of the 
main types of stakeholders and to let the detailed definition of their preoccupations 
to local enterprise architectures, because these questions are generally specific to 
each establishment. In particular, the most important preoccupations vary from one 
enterprise to another; the same happens to the most important to be grasped from 
the architecture point of view.
6.6  SADC Social Systems Architecture
The field of social systems architecture meets the needs of users, planners and 
virtual communities and organizations’ managers. While the main part of the social 
systems architecture’s content describes strategies specifically to management and

operational aspects of the virtual community, the reference architecture can also 
present main preoccupations and basic concepts in order to establish a common 
terminology of collaboration social systems.
6.6.1  The Collaboration Model
The SADC has adopted from TOGAF and developed a varied explicative and 
descriptive model to reflect the various aspects of collaborative work in organiza-
tions and private and public virtual communities. It is founded on the experience of 
works performed with an array of industrial and social organizations, as well as the 
existing documentation on cooperative computer-assisted work related to distrib-
uted cognition, education and social and organizational psychology, management 
sciences and the collaboration within the healthcare teams (Fig. 6.6).
This model can serve as a work framework to define and structure the needs of 
generic users for new technologies or collaboration practice purposes. It allows the 
decision-makers, the designers and the developers to examine the interaction of differ-
ent factors that, together, constitute a collaboration system. It also allows them to 
specify fields they aim in order to increase the interoperability and efficiency of the 
collaborative work. For example, they could develop technologies to help diminish 
cultural or professional differences likely to influence the group collaborative work.
The classification and the identification of design activities remain a very com-
plicated task in the sense where they risk to bring certain structuring problems to 
light. The fundamental objective of design is to understand the problem structure 
Fig. 6.6  Framework for 
collaborative practice
6  Towards a Scientific Collaborative Design Approach: The Construction…

191
with the solution that is in part integrated in the design effort, which is structured in 
a way to solve problems. The plurality of visions brings designers to spend more 
time trying to structure the problem instead of solving it. This is why it is important 
to confine the design activities before suggesting potential design solutions. 
Table 6.4 presents the majority of those activities.
The evaluation activities (Table 6.4 centre column) seek to find possible design 
solutions. These activities touch upon the analysis and the potential solutions’ eval-
uation of the design requirements or needs. According to Sim and Duffy (2003), 
according to the design model, we adopt a centred approach, either on the project or 
on the product, inside of which planning and execution of diverse design activities 
are made. The approach oriented on the project is focused first on problem analysis, 
followed by a systematic fulfilment processing, or a series of possible solutions are 
generated and evaluated progressively and then decomposed to converge towards 
the best solution. The approach oriented on the product is more centred on the use 
of solution conjectures to generate a solution concept allowing to enrich knowledge 
and to improve the problem’s definition. The great number of analyses and evaluations 
preformed on problem activities allows to optimize the problem’s decomposition 
and its solution. Sim and Duffy emphasize that the solution analysis and evaluation 
constitute a phase of common design activities of both approaches. There is a design 
category that analyses and evaluates performance solutions according to certain 
criteria. This is what we call the evaluation of design activities or the design analysis 
and the activity evaluation.
The third column of Table 6.4 describes the management activities that address 
the relations or interdependence between the activities taking place during the 
design process. Designers must be able to influence the design process by perform-
ing strategic considerations. The knowledge management experts and experienced 
communauticians opinions are determining in the strategy selection. Several types 
of strategies are used at various levels of an organization, and there also are different 
levels of detail in the development or the process. In this case, strategic knowledge

is a basis for the expertise in the fields where management or governance problems 
depend on the actions to undertake. This choice is problematic and requires a con-
siderable amount of human expertise. In fact, it is knowledge that allows the strate-
gies formation; the action plans determine the types of knowledge and tactics to use 
according to the problem context. That being said, there is a design activity category 
that encompasses the choices made by the designers to manage the design process 
progress. They are the management activities. Therefore, the criteria of activity cat-
egory classification rely on the acquired knowledge in the design process manage-
ment (Sim and Duffy 2003).
6.6.2  Reference Enterprise Services and the Functions
The collaboration model describes the different aspects of collaboration. In practice, 
these aspects are tightly linked in most collaboration environments. By drawing 
inspiration from the collaboration model, we have chosen to distinguish four main 
types of collaboration services:
•	 Communication services, they are related to the exchange of interpersonal infor-
mation; they focus on the actors and group factors of collaboration.
•	 Cooperation services, collaboration relative to the use of tools to manipulate 
objects with the objective to produce results; they focus on the aspects that facili-
tate collaboration.
•	 Coordination services, they are related to the orchestration, the choreography 
and the emerging organization of tasks, processing and human and material 
resources.
•	 The reference service offers the users the production of knowledge and information 
that are part of the environment and are available throughout the collaboration.
These four types of services are strongly interdependent. For example, through 
cooperation, the coordination is often achieved thanks to communication. The 
inclusion of certain tools or information contents with the main basic objective of 
cooperation instead of in the context of collaboration, or vice versa, sometimes is a 
subjective judgment. We chose to apply this structure because it allows a certain 
organization of the great number of available services. The 3C of collaboration 
(communication, coordination, cooperation) are also well established in the research 
community in collective teleworking, while the collaboration context has been 
underlined as being fundamentally important by the CoSpaces users.
6.6.2.1  The Communication Services
On the collaboration model basis (TOGAF, 2009) and a survey regarding the 
research works, requirements and scenarios of the CoSpaces users, we have identified 
several generic communication services. They are related to the exchanges of 
6  Towards a Scientific Collaborative Design Approach: The Construction…

193
interpersonal information; they focus on the actors and group factors of collaboration. 
They are represented in Fig. 6.7.
The generic services presented in Fig. 6.7 and resulting from these three groups 
could not be considered like an exhaustive, definitive or complete list. Like the 
TOGAF (2009) enterprise continuum, it must be considered as a “virtual bank” of 
reusable architecture elements that will be elaborated, adapted and expanded by 
norms of the community in the context of an open living architecture.
Also, if Fig. 6.7 indicates some specialization relations between the main services, 
several dependency relations could have also been included. In order to preserve the 
generality and legibility of the models, we have, however, chosen to not present a 
great number of these dependencies.
Support to the conversation remains the most generic form of communication. 
Meetings are planned conversations likely to have a predefined program. Figure 6.7 
shows more specializations of communication according to the media (text, audio 
and video) and the structure (brainstorm, structured conversations). The majority of 
other services support communication through the organization of people (role and 
group management) or by increasing the bandwidth or the availability of the virtual 
communication (avatars, population awareness, session’s history). Finally, we 
highlight social networking like being one of the important aspects and goals of 
communication.

6.6.2.2  Cooperation Services
Generic cooperation services address the use of collaborative tools to manipulate 
objects in order to produce results by emphasizing the aspects that facilitate collabo-
ration. Once again, the service’s list is not exhaustive, and several other specialized 
services should be included in the architecture of a society, a network organization, 
a project or a particular scenario group.
Most of these services are distributed in three main categories: information pro-
duction, information management and application management. Information pro-
duction addresses the management of documents and data, including the 
collaborative edition of documents, annotations and comments and the detection of 
problems, product life management or PLM, product data management or PDM, 
etc. Information management supports and coordinates the production of informa-
tion; it ensures the management of the working space and access control, specific 
role examination, change management, the control of versions and configuration 
management, the interoperability of data, reproduction and transformation. Let us 
underline the existence of underlying awareness, resources and notification services 
that serve them and meet several other needs. Finally, the applications management 
related to the sharing control and remote execution, screen sharing, collaborative 
visualization and simulation, so many services that facilitate simultaneous design, 
are integrated in the platform.
6.6.2.3  Generic Coordination Services
Coordination services can be supported by an explicit representation of the work to 
be accomplished, whether it is emerging or structured, like task management, or if 
they subscribe to predefined workflow like the social systems processing man-
agement. The support of information management offers a necessary overview to 
the exercise of a leadership supported by surveillance services and control panel. 
The data entry processing and the session’s history can serve as foundation. The 
support to proactive management ensured by services allows a management by 
strategies and objectives, project management and planning, workforce planning, 
systems regulations and policies, the definition of execution constraints, etc. 
The horizontal coordination can very well be taken over; however, other functions 
like the reiteration in collaborative sessions, services and calendar planning, the 
entry of the best practices and their reuse (e.g. processes) are more often designed 
in a horizontal coordination spirit.
We can regroup the generic design activities in three main categories:
•	 The definition activities: These activities aim at the complexity management of a 
complex evolutive design while defining it gradually until it possesses all the 
details required for production.
•	 The evaluation activities: These activities consist of analysing and evaluating the 
feasibility of potential design solutions by rejecting unrealizable solutions; they 
contribute to reduce the solution space of design.
6  Towards a Scientific Collaborative Design Approach: The Construction…

195
•	 The management activities: These activities manage the complexity of activity 
coordination associated with an evolutive design environment and its processing.
•	 The context of collaboration contains multiple dimensions. The organizational 
and personal dimensions require help to find experts, to personalize collaboration 
services and to use role playing for learning, exploration and skills management. 
The physical dimensions require an awareness to the location and distances as 
well as the possibility to create a virtual environment that reproduces a remote 
environment that generates the feeling of “being there” for the remote participants 
and the experts offering their services remotely during their local inspections. 
The dimension of information and knowledge of the context also translates 
through the necessity of knowledge management, training services, an under-
standing of the lessons learned, information exchanges and metadata management. 
Finally, we need a certain number of generic services to use contextual information, 
like navigation, filtering, visualization, multiple views as well as points of view 
and awareness of the supply context.
6.6.2.4  Dependencies and Orientation Analysis
In order to create a socio-technical system’s architecture and a collaboration archi-
tecture at the user level, it is not enough to identify the necessary services. We must 
also capture the collaboration aspects and the applicable criteria to each service in 
order to help users solve their problems. The relations between generic aspects of 
the collaboration model and the services supporting them illustrate the complexity 
of interdependence relations between collaboration aspects and the services. 
Therefore, we have used this structure to guide users on technological support and 
analysis methods applicable to these dependency relations. The services supporting 
the construction team have been identified. The meetings about support and the 
reflection are for the construction team, while the avatars and the conversation 
support can improve knowledge (familiarity) and other psychological factors that 
will contribute to the team support and reinforcement.
In order to support a concrete collaboration scenario, constitutive elements of 
this generic service model must be widened, specialized and decomposed in various 
targeted collaboration services. The collaboration model and functional service 
points of view presented in this section seek to guide the solution development 
process by helping stakeholders to determine the levels of advanced collaboration 
services adapted to their situation.
6.6.2.5  Reference Needs
The user’s needs, such as expressed by the CoSpaces industry partners, can serve as 
starting points to analyse the needs in an organization, a virtual community or an 
inter-organizational project. The analysis needs (requests) often face the dilemma of 
the chicken and the egg: users have a hard time understanding the range of needs 
6.6  SADC Social Systems Architecture

they need to validate, while developers do not want to give them strict advice in 
order to limit the entry bandwidth. By providing examples of current requests, the 
SADC illustrates the requests’ nature and form (needs) and provides a reusable 
request declarations catalogue (requests) a community or virtual organization can 
select. This strategy presents the risk of users selecting too many requests (need) 
less important in this preproduction data list and leaves aside the additional needs 
(requests) that are more important to them.
The collaboration space needs model reflects the different aspects of such 
methodology:
•	 The needs are grouped by types and by categories.
•	 The needs are related to the use scenarios and processing where necessary.
•	 The types of needs categories are related to the different aspects of the collabora-
tion model.
•	 The collaboration model aspects, the types and the needs are related to collabora-
tion services and technological elements that resolve the needs or are influenced 
by them (Sim and Duffy 2003).
These dependency links can be useful for the needs analysis. With more details, 
they complete the highest level of collaboration models and the easiest one to use. 
We have discovered that a great number of needs, classification relations and other 
dependency links make this model somewhat complex illegible. The categories and 
types fill a key function in the filtering of needs according to the preoccupations of 
the different stakeholders and the relevance of the different scenarios.
In view of a great number of specific needs, an analysis method based on the 
representation of direct relations between the needs and all software would be 
both tedious to establish and complex and difficult to use. In order to provide a 
simpler and easier framework to use, we have chosen to use the collaboration 
model as a lens to analyse the needs. By grouping the needs according to the col-
laboration model elements they report to, we are able to identify the relevant 
technologies founded on the links between architecture software and the collabo-
ration model.
Instead of directly linking each of these numerous needs to the collaboration 
model, we have simplified them even more by linking them to the type of model 
and the need categories instead. Most of these relations reflect the specialization, 
which takes into account the types and the categories, by incorporating them to 
the elements and services of the collaboration model and vice versa. This indi-
cates that both structures are in fact at the same level and that they play similar 
roles in the global architecture. Ideally, these structures should be combined, so 
that the types and the needs categories would be an integral part of the collaboration 
model. The current model reflects the historical progresses of collaborative work 
where the collaboration model originates from the needs. In a next revision of the 
architecture, all needs should be classified again according to the collaboration 
model instead of types and temporary categories.

6.6.2.6  Security and Communication Design
The point of view of physical technologies deals with security problems and 
communication. It is a challenge to support the dynamic nature of collaborative 
work while ensuring the appropriate processing of questions related to trust and 
security. A collaboration system must provide support to the information users and 
put at their disposal a knowledge support sub-system in addition to take into account 
their current activity context, like producing and sharing knowledge in a community 
of practice. More precisely, the security framework provides the users with a sup-
port for the selection at the participants’ request, documents and necessary data for 
a collaboration session. This framework facilitates the integration of participants in 
the collaboration sessions and the access to their collaborators and applications. 
This requires associated devices automatically configurable for punctual collabora-
tion purposes.
The security architecture is specifically designed for the following purposes:
•	 Secure communications and appropriately protect information resources used in 
the collaborative tools.
•	 Support efficient commercial transactions and secured service provisions.
•	 Capture the opportunities to obtain security synergies and economies of scale on 
the IT plan.
In a wider perspective, IT security is a continuous process where the material, 
software and users’ knowledge are continuously the object of observations, improve-
ments and updates. The security is analysed according to diverse points of view:
•	 The authentication and authorization
•	 The security and infrastructure process
•	 The network’s security
A secured technical and manageable infrastructure must take into account the 
elements above at a precocious stage of its design regarding the new Web 
­components. If this awareness is made possible thanks to an integration with exist-
ing applications, it will be about applying well-defined exemplary practices.
The data security includes technical procedures and measures put in place to 
prevent any unauthorized user to access, modify contents or use and distribute 
stocked or processed data by the system. Data security also includes the data integ-
rity (the preservation of their exactness and their validity) and the system’s protec-
tion against physical damages (including preventative measures and collection 
procedures).
The authorization control limits the access to data of each level to authorized users 
only. Guidelines and procedures can be established for accountability and levels as 
well as the control type. This obligation encompasses the possibility to specify data 
subgroups and to differentiate between users’ groups. Furthermore, a decentralized 
authorization control assumes a particular importance for distributed systems.
6.6  SADC Social Systems Architecture

198
Data protection is necessary to prevent an unauthorized user to access the data. 
Coding the data is one of the main methods to protect them. It is useful for stocked 
information on the hard drive as well as for information exchanged on the network.
Because the SADC calls for an intensive collaboration between several organizations 
established in various countries, the security considerations are an essential aspect. 
In our approach, services and application providers make authorization decisions 
based on the parameters affected to the user by his organization. This principle is to 
protect the resources without damaging the flexibility and the support of the work 
environment.
In the grand schemes of things, the SADC contains a set of model views that 
offer a complete definition of collaborative work environments. In order to simplify 
the integration of existing enterprise architectures as well as their evolution, poten-
tially their normalization, its structure follows the TOGAF norm. The content 
includes:
•	 A governance architecture, encompassing the general principles of the architecture 
and the current commercial strategies focused on collaboration
•	 An enterprise architecture, with the contribution of standard services and a 
collaboration model on the organizational aspects of collaboration
•	 An information systems architecture that defines a logical framework for collabora-
tion software, illustrating how to implement this framework and that specifies the 
component interfaces such as workspaces and Web services
•	 A technical architecture that relates the information systems components to the 
underlying application of the framework reflected in the standard reference models 
for the TOGAF technology and the integrated information infrastructure
•	 A realization architecture that identifies formal norms and collaboration industry 
norms as well as their use by different application components.
The SADC platform will start with the Colab that will serve as a model for virtual 
enterprises and organizations. The Colab will be a starting point for the enterprise 
wishing to implement new collaboration solutions. Like an enterprise architecture, 
it covers both enterprise and collaboration aspects, and it relates these two notions 
in order to advise enterprises in the choice of technology that better meet their 
commercial needs. We have explained how TOGAF’s development architecture 
methodology (DAM) can be applied to create reference architectures in industry 
sectors, enterprises and collaboration projects at the architectures level, starting 
with the integration of the Colab.
Other works will allow to establish an open framework to update the SADC, 
describing the process by which other contributors could submit revisions or extensions 
to the published architecture and accept future revisions of a publication.

From Modeling to Implantation: the 
Reference Framework, Instantiation 
Methodology and the Discovery and 
Strategic Alignment Matrices
–In this part, we will present a construction guide for digital social systems (virtual 
communities, innovation communities, collaborative platform) that contains several 
reference models which translate into a series of guidelines and means to support 
the processes and activities involved in the co-design (large-scale collaborative 
design, also called community informatics design) of these new virtual environ-
ments. The community informatics design guide aims to help creators of diverse 
types of digital social systems, the framework and the virtual environment design 
experts to understand well the development conditions as well as the set of mecha-
nisms, functionalities and creativity tools to manage and operationalize their entire 
life cycle and the various roles of actors and partners.

Chapter 7
Reference Model, Governance Framework 
and Instantiation Strategy
Digital social systems can be centred on several economic activity models seeking 
to transform the physical creativity vision of organizations and traditional social 
systems (architectures and construction of buildings with well-defined borders, lin-
ear process of enterprises’ value chain, university or government institutions) in a 
multiform and multifunctional network structure, in order to increase their chances 
to commit to “collaborative activities” producing value. New virtual environments 
co-design to assist the design of digital social systems (services portal or innova-
tions community) that systematically uses the network and socio-digital media 
infrastructures. Community informatics design will take a considerable scope in the 
next years because the “participative social architecture” (PSA) adds a sense of 
location and time and an additional value to traditional notions of physical space 
and social time, where human activities used to take place (Harvey 2018, to be 
published).
Web 3.0’s and Web 4.0’s digital social systems (DSS) emerge thanks to the col-
laboration mechanisms put in place through the social Web infrastructures that must 
be included like social collaborative architectures. Indeed, DSS apply the common 
network infrastructures and the ICT in order to free themselves from the restrictive 
barriers of the geographical determinism, without forgetting, of course, the tangible 
aspect of human relations or inter-organizations. However, the infrastructure aspect 
does not exhaust the structuring work of the community informatics expert in the 
development of new collaborative spaces. Computer-mediatized collaboration and 
communication contain several complex and abstract processes related to affilia-
tion, trust, cohesion and resources sharing. To provide the necessary elements for 
social communication in the new collaborative spaces and to ensure the develop-
ment of a virtual community understood as a digital social system based on inter-
connectivity allowed by technology, we suggest to revisit the idea of a “socio-technical 
system”, expression introduced by the Tavistock Institute of London that we will 
apply to our study object: the construction of digital social systems by the commu-
nity informatics design team. This research orientation has expanded over several 
decades, and we shall see that in order to understand and build the future DSS, we 

202
must drastically extend not only our theoretical foundations regarding the usual 
communication and social science concepts but also any praxeological foundation 
of a communicational action science for the construction of collaborative virtual 
environments. In this context, we must borrow a few concepts from management 
and computer sciences and community informatics design, not to formalize our 
approach but to give it a more systematic and operational character.
Therefore, from the design and social systems design works of Banathy (1996) 
and his successors, Laszlo et al. (2010), Laszlo and Laszlo (2002, 2004, 2007), 
Laszlo (1972), Jenlink (2004, 2009), Jenlink and Banathy (2002, 2008) and 
Reigeluth and Jell-Carr (1998), and those of Flood and Jackson (1991) on critical 
social systems, Günter Ropohl’s (1979, 1999) on socio-technological systems, 
those of Wolfgang Hofkirchner (2009) and Christian Fuchs (2004, 2008) on social 
sciences applied to design and knowledge management, the convergence theories of 
Gunilla Bradley in Sweden, the re-articulation of the collective action theory of 
Bruce Bimber in the United States, the works of Rob Kling (1997, 2007) and Alice 
Robbin (2011) on social computing and Elinor Ostrom’s (Ostrom and Hess 2011) 
on the analysis of socio-ecological systems, we have strong theoretical foundations 
to analyse and build the DSS. We complete this generic approach of social systems 
by a socio-technical reference model included as a subsystem of human activity 
(Checkland and Scholes 1990; Checkland 1981), a socio-technical system. In this 
context, community informatics design is a design centred on the human that uses a 
complex system thinking, the social science one, as an explicit reference basis.
7.1  Digital Social Systems Objectives and Benefits
DSS have several objectives from an economic or organizational standpoint. 
Whether they are oriented towards social action, organizational design, social 
design, platform design, the business and innovation field, organizational change or 
educational activities, their main objective is to establish the trust (Luhmann 1989, 
1995) between the members that wish to collaborate by decreasing the general costs 
of the communication action (Moles and Rohmer 1986; Moles 1981; Harvey 2008; 
Habermas 1973, 1984) aiming to identify partners for a particular digital social 
systems configuration (a virtual team, a learning community, a strategic inter-­
enterprise network). The DSS provides concepts, creativity tools and methods to 
shorten the development stage of a community or a socio-technical system through 
the various life-cycle phases of the community informatics design.
The DSS creation and design may contain several benefits for their members. 
From the network support and the infrastructures related to information technolo-
gies and communication point of view, Afsarmanesh and Camarinha-Matos (2005) 
and Camarinha-Matos and Afsarmanesh (2006, 2008) note ten from the most impor-
tant ones that we will adapt to our context:
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

203
	 1.	 Action flexibility and promptness to help the members seize new collaboration 
opportunities
	 2.	 The acquisition of a widened dimension, in order compete with larger 
organizations
	 3.	 The influence of partners by lobbying and marketing, to expand their geograph-
ical presence in a global market’s perspective
	 4.	 An increased power of negotiation in partnership purchasing situations
	 5.	 Access to a transparent collaboration infrastructure, turnkey, to facilitate col-
laboration and the updating of different activities between members
	 6.	 Mechanisms, processes, guidelines, design and innovation guides, assistance 
services, animation and support data base to facilitate creation and the deploy-
ment of a digital social system
	 7.	 Proactive profiling of members and partners and dynamic management of indi-
vidual and collective skills to ensure the optimization of skills and resources 
likely to meet an innovation or business opportunity or to contribute to the solv-
ing of a problem or the settlement of a dispute
	 8.	 Innovation support services like questions related to copyright, learning or con-
tinuous education and tailor-made training through various types of institu-
tional support (foundation, expertise, advice, platform design)
	 9.	 Introduction of trust consolidation mechanisms between members or between 
partners and the network
	10.	 Presentation of the general principles of community informatics design and 
ethics guiding the development of collaborative design, like remote work, and 
information, knowledge and resource sharing principles
However, in order for the DSS to develop correctly and so they can generate 
these benefits for the community or the organization, we have prepared a series of 
required conditions:
	1.	 An information technology and communication infrastructure (exclusive and 
open-source code) and a series of creativity tools and social media that support 
the management of the evolutive virtual environment prototype and the creation 
of the digital social system. In the “My Portal Col@b and community informat-
ics design project”, it is our portal that will fill these functions in the wider sense 
like a large socio-technical system (or virtual environment) assisting the com-
munity informatics design of DSS (communities and online organizations of all 
sorts like a corporate platform for real estate management).
	2.	 The active involvement of members and their commitment to participate to the 
co-creation of the prototype, especially through the generation of updated con-
tents and made available to the community and by the identification of their 
respective roles and skills.
	3.	 The scenario of a viable community (business model, economic model, organi-
zational design or community strategy).
	4.	 The implementation of a global governance strategy and management strategies 
(people, knowledge, resources, etc.).
7.1  Digital Social Systems Objectives and Benefits

204
	5.	 The establishment of evolutive learning strategies and digital skills management 
to improve reflexive practice, the DSS quality and life conditions of all in the 
context of a “communicational responsible act”.
7.2  Community Informatics Design Social Architecture: 
An Evolutive Life Cycle
Several strategic approaches in organizational communication use systemic think-
ing and design thinking to engage the stakeholders and coordinate their activities in 
diverse participative process and to consider the interconnections between the orga-
nization and its action context, for example, interactive management (Warfield 
1990), the methodology of flexible systems (Checkland 1981), idealized systems 
design, evolutive systems design (Laszlo 2001; Laszlo and Laszlo 2004), the inter-
vention in total systems (Flood and Jackson 1991), management of complexity 
(Gharajedaghi 1999), organizational modeling (Morabito et al. 1999), enterprise 
architecture (Nadler 1981), the self-organization approach (Jantsch 1980), socio-­
technologies (Bunge 1999), design thinking (Brown and Duguid 1996, 2000, 2001; 
Brown and Isaacs 2005), practice communities (Wenger 1998), activity theory 
(Engeström 1999) and the structured dialogic design (Christakis 1996; Christakis 
and Bausch 2006), Transition Design (Terry Irwin 2015).
However, none of these changes and innovation approaches systematically takes 
into consideration the role and challenges of the ICT and their impact on intentional 
change and the creation of the future digital social systems, except recent initiatives 
in transition design. By contrast, according to the general implicit culture of these 
different approaches, social and communication sciences are not only useful to the 
critic of social systems, they can also be integrated to different disciplines with 
more technological perspectives, for example, information systems management, 
social computing, community informatics, technology and society sciences, Internet 
research, computer-assisted collaborative work, human machine interfaces that 
require both a certain formalization of their approach and a short-term perspective 
and problem-solving as well as researches and integrated approaches in the long 
term like ethnography and participative research action (Eriksson et al. 2006; Shuler 
1993) and all kinds of ecosystem innovation.
Community informatics design does not integrate social sciences before or after 
the social systems design process to put the activities into context. It makes them 
intervene in a critical and reflexive way throughout the co-design phases. In the next 
sections, we will present a creative and reflexive framework for the DSS develop-
ment while integrating an ethic and a semiformal architecture approach, which is 
often lacking in social sciences, in the name of intuition, emergence and emotional-
ity. A socially responsible community informatics design cannot let fate, vagueness, 
conceptual or disciplinary imprecision guide the implantation of large-scale digital 
social systems.
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

205
In the society of communication, innovation, social inclusion, protection of 
children and elderly, dispute settlement, content organizing and knowledge sharing 
in communities of all sorts require digital and generic skills that must be taught at 
all levels of the educational system and society. It is not a phenomenon foreign to 
the human being or one that we can exclusively criticize from the outside or from 
only one discipline. In fact, several systems and social system design approaches 
can be put to contribution to build democratic platforms of the future. The commu-
nity informatics design approach is evolutive and emerging; it operates through a 
semiformal social architecture, by incorporating the powerful social systems design 
approaches without neglecting the management sciences, cognitive sciences, busi-
ness ecosystem, information systems and the complexity sciences approaches. We 
combine them and incorporate them in a general ethical design framework we call 
“community informatics axiology” (see the glossary), which are general principles 
and shared values in design activities.
Therefore, community informatics design can be considered as a scientific pro-
cess in the classical sense of the word, containing development phases and well-­
identified procedures, but it is above all a culture of the reflective practice defined 
by Schön (1983), an open and flexible heuristic that requires creativity and imagina-
tion in the democratic vision of the socio-economic development. Heuristic and 
semiformalism are not opposed; they complete each other in an evolutive and gen-
erative vision of social change. However, it is not an algorithmic process where the 
results would be predictable and where rules and procedures would be fixed and 
preformatted for any type of use. Community informatics design can be motivated 
by problem-solving or strategic planning, but it focuses mostly on viable sociologi-
cal change solutions and the suppression of social or organizational pathologies.
Community informatics design is a heuristic in the sense that it constitutes an 
exploratory design space where multiple creation, modeling and emergence possi-
bilities are catalysed in a series of generative processes that involve the definition of 
a research frontier or the exploration of relevant processes to a specific problem. It is 
not about stages that are well defined and that would lead to predictable results. The 
heuristic aspect contains three main dimensions: (1) an ontological and epistemo-
logical component that provides the basis for the creative exploration of community 
information design; (2) a meta-methodology and meta-design perspective that allow 
the exploration of a universe of possibilities and complementary social creativity 
approaches (Fischer 2011, 2013a; Fischer and Konomi 2007) like in human centered 
design (methods and techniques collaboration and creativity tools); (3) and finally, a 
series of principles and consensual values that serve as quality criteria through which 
we can guide us to perform the design research and invent the DSS of the future. It is 
a responsible communication heuristic put at the service of sustainable development, 
an open and flexible heuristic that generates appropriate creativity processes to each 
situation, community and specific organization that uses it. It falls under the intuition 
and the generic comprehension of stages and knowledge bases (not always well 
defined nor fixed ahead of time) that make DSS operational. Contrary to certain 
approaches of traditional information systems, it does not aim data and practice codi-
fication, nor does it suggest a standardized and well-established scientific approach. 
7.2  Community Informatics Design Social Architecture: An Evolutive Life Cycle

206
This does not translate a lack of a certain procedures’ systematization nor the fact 
that this beginning of formalism is against the emancipation of human and social 
factors. It is a flexible and systematic way to begin a rigorous research process.
Understood like that, community informatics design can be defined as a heuristic 
approach (semiformal) seeking to support and guide researchers, practitioners and 
partners in the participative co-creation of sustainable, desirable and responsible 
DSS. Useful until a certain point for the non-initiated, it prescribes a general com-
municational action framework and even provides a fundamental checklist (see 
Chap. 10) and very detailed entities, things and structuring elements that can be 
incorporated and organized in DSS to make them evolve in a permanent way. Here, 
it is a question of team management, collaborative learning, methodology and activ-
ities. Because it is about complex activities that will have a real repercussion on 
individuals’ activities, groups and partner organizations, we suggest a semiformal 
approach that lies between neopositivist formalism of information systems engi-
neering and the more open participative research-action pragmatism of social sci-
ences and information and communication sciences.
Social systems are varied, dynamic and unique. They represent a substantial part 
of the cultural heritage of our societies and economies. For this reason, we must pay 
a particular attention to the development of information systems (community) that, 
once operational, will either value or hinder social systems and existing organiza-
tions. Flexible and evolutive social architecture that supports the DSS must meet the 
particular members’ needs. However, as architectures built for housing or the tradi-
tional construction industry, several of the entities, resources and materials that con-
stitute it are found entirely or partially in various types of organizations and online 
communities. Just like we always need foundations, walls, hallways and rooms in 
the architecture of housing construction, for example, the DSS must be built on 
solid foundations, and it contains certain restrictions on access to certain services, 
informational spaces accessible to the public and others reserved for experts and 
certain partners, creativity tools and platforms that can be restrictive or convivial for 
the user (ref. Harvey 2018). All these elements and several others will be the object 
of a reflection, a collective decision-making on scenarios or alternative infrastruc-
tures on the realization phases to respect, on costs, time and the risks associated 
with different DSS projects. This is why the entire community informatics design 
process resembles an evolutive life cycle that is supported by a series of “attractors” 
like the value of innovation for the quality of life and the economy, responsible 
communication in organizations, the instrumental value of certain creativity tools 
and their intrinsic functional utility for the lifestyles, a value added in a new busi-
ness model.
Community informatics design also suggests possible approaches (research 
action, ethnography of uses and practices, events or situation simulations), creativ-
ity tools and conceptual resources that can be useful for the DSS design. By no 
means should we let chance or improvisation dictate the development of social sys-
tems that could in certain cases contain significant strategic dimensions for the 
members and partners (even if creativity and spontaneity of certain initiatives 
­sometimes require a field of larger action and imagination freedom and with fewer 
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

207
constraints and formalism). Participants of the DSS design process create their own 
community informatics design implantation approach according to the type of 
favoured organization or platform design. They select relevant elements, method-
ological approaches and collaborative tools by combining their ideas and docu-
menting the creative solutions exploration with the appropriate resources, according 
to the ideal image of the digital social system they want to build for themselves. 
However, even if we can find as many versions of DSS as community informatics 
users/designers teams, they will always have a common denominator, what we call 
a reference model, which promotes the continuous exploration of evolutive values 
and principles of the community and, combined with an evolutive design ethic, will 
allow to continue the research in accordance with the actors mainly targeted by the 
new systems.
During our research process, our community informatics design approach has 
made explicit our commitment to improve the digital skills of users and permanent 
learning. Because these elements are explicit in the general research-action process 
in social and communication sciences, learning values the design process, and 
design values the learning process. Several trajectories are possible when comes the 
time to direct our activities towards sustainable development and socio-economic 
innovation, and the notion of learning and improving the skills is the driving force 
of this continuous process at the heart of the DSS community informatics design.
7.3  Community Informatics Design Social Architecture: 
A Conversation
Community informatics design is built on a basis of processes, contents and flexible 
technologies, but not random, that each community or organization can adapt and 
recreate or take the design according to its particular objectives and needs. These 
processes and contents are consolidated through the means of conversational design 
and the learning of new collaboration architectures through new platform design 
methodologies and tools.
We introduce here the concept of conversational design (Banathy 1996) to 
explain two types of dialogue that are appropriate for the non-initiated designers 
that need to execute community informatics design of digital social systems. From 
the works of Schein (1993) and Beck (2009), Banathy and Jenlink (2005) try to link 
the discussion on dialogue to the social systems design communication mode. 
Members of a practice or innovation community can now enter the universe of digi-
tal social systems design and explore the discourse method or the type of communi-
cation/animation that applies best to the DSS development. Banathy and Jenlink 
state that the combination of a generative dialogue and a strategic dialogue leads to 
a complete social communication method that is more viable to use for the members 
of a designer’s community. They call this method “conversational design”. The 
importance and the power of dialogue in the design of practice communities become 
a more and more common topic, especially when the designers’ community must 
7.3  Community Informatics Design Social Architecture: A Conversation

208
configure architectures or give advice on the structure of the future online commu-
nity (Brown and Isaacs 2005; Bohm 1996; Wheatley 2002). Contrary to engineering 
practices of information systems where the conversation between designers is artic-
ulated around the formal codification language of reality and the programming of 
closed functionalities, conversational design uses community informatics design 
like a human process through which we create our institutions, our cultures and, 
today, our digital social systems. The great physicist David Bohm tells us that the 
real dialogue consists of “thinking together”. Nevertheless, conversational design, 
as an open-decision-making process, requires certain particular skills from the par-
ticipants and becomes more efficient socially when it is articulated and facilitated 
within certain general adaptable instructions, from both the field of information 
systems and the field of social sciences. Our portal will provide some precise 
examples.
As we illustrate it in Fig. 7.2, the semiformal community informatics design pro-
cesses are the following:
	1.	 Generative Processes: Processes and mechanisms by which the designing com-
munity learns to realize its aspirations and create an innovation community that 
becomes collaborative and responsible. Through a generative conversation, the 
members of the future online platform community learn to develop their indi-
vidual potential and their collective and collaborative intelligence.
	2.	 Evolutive Learning Processes: By progressive and evolutive learning, the mem-
bers of the innovator community develop their individual, collective and digital 
skills that can lead them to become dynamic community informatics designers, 
capable to build DSS and online communities and platforms of all kinds. The 
evolutive learning is guided by the development life cycle that goes through the 
evolutive development stages, from the evolutive conscience to the evolutive 
praxis.
	3.	 Strategic Processes: These processes catalyse the intentional, communicational 
and collaborative action as a creation, governance, ethics and partnership pro-
cess in the community informatics design development cycle that will allow to 
engage the members, designers and partners in the creation of the DSS. The 
practice community represents innovation in itself, and at the same time, it cre-
ates a future digital social system that will help generate other social or eco-
nomic innovations; in other words, it is getting ready for evolutive action.
	4.	 Integration Processes: The planning and the different DSS design phases are 
represented in these processes that bring the innovation community to commit to 
a dynamic conversational design process with its environment (physical, biologi-
cal, psychological, ecological, sociocultural; situations, contexts, events, part-
ners). The conversation must be taken in the sense of actions, activities and 
interactions through which members commit to the conscious DSS structuring 
that will influence its environment and will be influenced by it in return.

action is built in four evolutive development stages (Laszlo et al. 2002, 2010; Laszlo 
and Laszlo 2004, 2007; Laszlo 1972); we can describe in the following way:
	1.	 The Evolutive Conscience: This learning stage entails the passing of an individ-
ual conscience to a collective conscience, challenges to face and problems to 
solve that go beyond a certain “egocentric immediacy” proper to the individual 
apprehension of a situation, a project or a given issue. The evolutive conscience 
puts at risk the expansiveness and the social skills associated with the aptitude to 
collaborate to the co-design and to develop cognition towards a collective com-
prehension of problems to be solved. It is acquired in the context of intercon-
nectivity of the worlds and the “distributed” nature of the activities to realize. It 
also goes through an increase of empathy for others and the knowledge of their 
needs in the setting of an innovation co-creation process for the participant, his 
community, his organization and the entire society.
	2.	 Digital Literacy: This stage involves a global and systemic understanding of 
computer-mediatized communication and collaboration, anchored in the reality 
of socio-digital networks, as well as processes promoting the participation to 
common activities through resources sharing and the digital badges to evaluate 
the twenty-first century co-design skills.
	3.	 The Generative Skill: This generic ability seeks to develop digital skills and abil-
ities for a behaviour in accordance with the prescriptions of the previous two 
stages, the empathy and the knowledge of others. It entails a personal commit-
ment process as a DSS community informatics designer.
	4.	 The Generative Praxis: This skills stage shows an important outcome in the 
mutual commitment and requires a permanent effort of openness to others and 
real and virtual worlds as a community informatics designer participating proac-
tively in the development of his community, organization or the entire society. 
Community informatics design promotes the acquisition of collaborative knowl-
edge and skills in the virtual worlds but also in all everyday activities, whether at 
home, at work or in the community.
These different skills and their respective development stages establish substan-
tial foundations, the global context, the reference model on which the interdepen-
dence of community informatics design, learning, design instantiation and action 
forge a systematic and intentional conversation.
7.4  The Life Cycle for the Creation of a DSS 
Through Community Informatics Design
In this section, we will describe the life cycle of a DSS as a methodological configu-
ration that we started to develop in 2004. That year, following a symposium at the 
Association canadienne pour l’avancement des sciences (ACFAS), we had pub-
lished an article entitled: “De l’intranet à la communautique, ou Valoriser l’entreprise 
interconnective pour le partage des savoirs” (Harvey 2004b). The idea was to

outline the different evolution life phases or stages of a DSS and of a construction 
model of a knowledge management practitioner’s community. Actually, a DSS 
emerges from its creation stage until its dissolution or, on the contrary, until the 
reach of a certain maturity or innovation stage. We presented in this text the com-
munication, collaboration, leadership and technology management and innovation 
strategic process outlines. From the complexity and activity theories and a transdis-
ciplinary anchoring from the technologies and information field and communica-
tion, we were suggesting then a first approach to model and implant community 
information systems (human-computer interfaces, collective teleworking).
Then, we broadened this perspective in successive works: in 2007 and 2008, in 
various conferences, we suggested, in a schematic form, the complete life cycle of 
community informatics design (Harvey 2008), which we had perfected over the 
years in our Masters and PhD classes without, however, describing the methodology 
in detail. It is in 2010, in an article published by Sage (Harvey 2010), that we pre-
sented a community informatics design overall approach relying on B.H. Banathy’s 
theory (1987, 1996) of organized activity, complexity and social systems design. We 
were showing then that, in order to innovate in the educational social systems just 
like in the co-creation of learning communities, the design research could constitute 
a valuable alternative solution to traditional educational technologies. The co-­
creation of virtual communities, educational ecosystems, e-commerce communi-
ties, strategic online business alliance platforms or non-profit organization 
communities can benefit greatly from community informatics design as a generic 
construction approach for these systems.
Nevertheless, the design of digital social systems and the sustainable develop-
ment strategies advocated today throughout society cannot be accomplished in the 
improvisation nor in a development approach that promotes old ways of doing, 
traditional linear management or the implantation of closed systems. The commu-
nity informatics design foundations and the collaborative learning culture on which 
it relies on largely are basic necessary conditions for conversational design and the 
joint optimization of social and technological. Thus we must understand the com-
munity informatics design as a commitment approach proposition and communi-
ties’ animation, in a creative process that considers not only the present or local 
state of a social system but also its context, as well as its interest for a specific 
organization or the community and its innovation potential for the economic life of 
future generations (e.g. by mastering new forms of organizations and digital social 
systems well and their possible repercussion on society).
In the following paragraphs, we will present the general description of the com-
munity informatics design architecture of the digital social systems. We will refer to 
you, readers or site navigators, as designers. First developed by Banathy (1996) and 
his successors (Laszlo and Laszlo 2004; Carr-Chellman and Savoy 2004; Laszlo 
et  al. 2010; Jenlink and Banathy 2002, 2008; Jenlink 2001, 2004; Jenlink and 
Reigeluth 2000; Reigeluth 1983, 1993), social systems design can be understood as 
a new intellectual technology that showed relevance right away for the DSS com-
munity informatics design.
However, in addition to social systems designer’s works, we add a particular 
three-level effort. In fact, the life cycle suggested takes into account information and 
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

211
communication technologies and activities (Engeström 1987, 1999) that are associ-
ated with each phase of their implantation as well as their strategic management and 
ethics. Thus, to the four phases stated by Banathy (1996) in his digital social sys-
tems design description (design solution space or DSS), we add three more that 
allow us to directly incorporate ICT in the system’s design and instantiation spaces. 
Figure 7.10 illustrates the phases described by Banathy (1996). We add an explora-
tion phase (S1) preceding the “imagine” phase related to creation and representa-
tion; a socio-technical space (S4) that allows to perform the design of creativity 
technologies and social media, of technological architecture and design and cre-
ation assisting tools; and finally a prototyping space (S6) and a deployment space 
(S7), because a DSS depends not only on the quality of the collaboration tools but 
also on their large-scale deployment that involves social appropriation of new tech-
nologies and a sociocultural animation strategy.
On this last note and as we have mentioned in the previous sections, this “socio-­
technology” is not only a creative imprecision with random results. Even if the 
community informatics design results are always uncertain because this form of 
design relies on human relations, on uncertainty associated with multiple skills and 
actors’ roles, as well as the difficulty to establish complex partnerships, the 
Community Informatics Design life cycle allow an exhaustive analysis of the many 
dimensions in presence. It also favoured a systematic operational instantiation of 
the solutions adopted during any social design project. Also, as it relies on the 
dynamics and trust between actors, emerging interpersonal interactions as well as 
favoured collaboration mechanisms, we could not ignore certain design and model-
ing norms. This involves not neglecting certain activities, certain prerequisites, cer-
tain procedures more efficient than others according to the case and the type of 
system to co-build. Instantiation flexibility does not mean conceptual or operational 
weakness.
Our works and observations in 2012 and 2013 have led the ACIL team to think 
about a semiformal methodology where socio-technical creativity is instantiated in 
three main types of collaboration support architecture in the DSS: social, organiza-
tional and technological architecture. These three great types of architecture, the 
structure and the processes from Sect. 5.6 serve as the base for the community 
informatics design cycle updating, which is combined with the DSS life cycle, 
because the design process, like the life of living organisms, is never completed. In 
this sense, community informatics design is the way through which a DSS, as living 
systems, maintains its structure while evolving.
We are conscious of the fact that researchers in social sciences or practitioners in 
information or communication sciences consider our reference model and our 
­methodological approach too orchestrated or its planning too formal which could 
damage the “sociological imagination” or stop the creativity conducive to socio-
digital networks’ spontaneity. Nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, the creation of a 
social system like an innovation platform in an enterprise cannot rely on pure impro-
visation nor lack a formal programming structure. Even in the case of an emerging 
virtual community, our experience has taught us the importance of having a project 
management minimum and ethical design principles to ensure the realization of a 
DSS project and the relevance of this new social structure. Therefore, even in the 
7.4  The Life Cycle for the Creation of a DSS Through Community Informatics Design

212
case of a temporary social structure, we will at least speak of scaffolding, and in the 
case of a practice community or innovation inter-enterprises that requires a more 
systematic overall approach, we will talk of architecture. Since this last concept is 
not very familiar to social or communication sciences researchers, the DSS con-
struction project overall and collaborative networks give it a large space within the 
community informatics design approach.
The decision to adopt a somewhat rigorous, systematic or relatively flexible 
approach depends on the situation, project, the more or less authoritarian or demo-
cratic nature of the system the partners wish to establish, etc. Whether it is for a 
more or less temporary collaborative network scaffolding or in the context of a 
long-term organizational architecture construction, our reference model is one of 
the first to be presented in English to the co-creators of DSS and online communi-
ties of all kinds. Without being an absolute prescriptive model, it still constitutes a 
reference model that inspires co-creation.
7.5  The Community Informatics Design’s Seven Spaces: 
General Principles
From design works from a first course in community informatics design we have 
built in 2010 for the students in the master’s program in communication at the 
University of Bayreuth, in Germany, we present our “reference model” or the basic 
community informatics design architecture which is based on seven phases (or 
design subspaces) such as we present it in a chapter in 2014. These seven design 
spaces are essential to the reflection and the activities linked to the community 
informatics design. These reflection and action spaces seek to document the design 
process and its specific life cycle. This process is not dynamic or evolutive in itself, 
but, once fed by the members’ representation, the situation analysis, problems diag-
nosis and the research on partner’s needs and aspirations, it will provide a support 
and intervention tool for the members so they can commit to establish a responsible 
communication for sustainable development and strategic innovation management.
Other perspectives can be put to contribution thanks to more specific social inno-
vation guides for the analysis of social appropriation of new technologies or other 
design elements from the enterprise architecture, organizational modeling and vir-
tual communities design and also thanks to technology appropriation or strategic 
implantation of online animation technique guides and to user guides for the strate-
gic management of innovation ecosystems implantation (that guides the most part 
of our research in the present book).
All this preliminary phase is destined to establish a first enriched image 
(Checkland) of the starting situation (intuitive problematic, non-initiated) that will 
be useful for the definition of each project’s life cycle. Life cycles are not universal, 
but they can look alike from one discipline or project to another. Thus, according to 
the state of the situation, the needs or the budget, the life cycle could be extended by 
a few weeks even a few months or years and will incorporate several methods, 
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

213
techniques, procedures and stages. In the My Portal Col@b project setting, the life 
cycle was a starting point to define theories, methodologies, the community infor-
matics and communicational reference framework and the stages to overcome, in 
short, the detailed architecture. The task was huge but very stimulating.
The seven exploratory design spaces were mapped in the summer of 2010 
(Fig. 7.6). These design spaces schematically represented an imaginary reflection 
territory explored, thanks to conversation and dialogue, and creativity in the action, 
as a possible space for concrete activities (instantiation process) being developed 
through “conversational design”. In Fig. 7.6 diagram, we integrate the ­“conversational 
design” theory (Jenlink 2004), Banathy’s theory (1996) and the works on activity 
theory from Engeström (1987, 1999) and Engeström et al. (2010). This “participa-
tive research-action” territory is traversed by an evolutive, recursive and iterative 
spiral where the conversation and diverse thinking modes are articulated around 
different dialogue modes (exploratory, abductive, deliberative). Here is the repre-
sentation of dialogue modes (according to Anthony Judge’s works on his site Laetus 
in Praesens) incorporated to the activity theory (Fig. 7.1).
We got inspired by the entire conversational design system represented in 
Fig. 7.1, starting from space 1 of Fig. 7.5, “Explore”, and continuing our temporal

trajectory towards the right, through space 2, “Imagine”, and so on, by navigating 
outside and inside each space, like a film director thinks about all his project’s steps, 
thinking about the roles, the possible scenarios, the infrastructures, architectures 
and processes to establish, the budgets and, most of all, the values and the ethical 
aspects to promote in the future design platform. Throughout this project’s starting 
period, we have done a first reading of the situation, the possible way to improve the 
existing situation as well as the role of social sciences in the design and manage-
ment of this type of project. We have summarily analysed existing social networks, 
recruited a basis team, thought of potential partners, the type of innovation (portal, 
SADC, business platform design) we would like to achieve and a social pathology 
to transcend or eradicate (job losses and need for innovation in Quebec). In short, 
we have started to verify the state of the situation and our own context (organization, 
extended family, university and colleges, local, community, global society, interna-
tional network), on the members’ needs, the required conditions, the preliminary 
activity calendar, the disciplines and fields to put to contribution, their ontology and 
the definition of fundamental concepts associated with the processes to implement, 
the roles of diverse actors, expert or citizen members and the contracts to conclude 
with various partners.
In this first space and with the help of the conversational design diagram, we 
initiated ourselves to the objects, products and services to develop, the applications 
to favour as well as the tools to develop, configure or establish from our first case 
studies. We have tried to consider the basic required digital skills to build our portal. 
However, we quickly realized that beyond the programming oriented towards the 
object by the traditional information systems approach, we should adopt a 
­programming oriented towards the aspects (Basden 2000, 2002, 2006) or towards 
communication that includes various wider aspects of a community information 
system design problematic. For example, at the architectures’ level, we had to go 
beyond the pure sciences technological architecture to suggest three other aspects: 
the seven spaces architecture, acting as a reference and reflection model, brought us 
to suggest technological, organizational and social architecture elements. 
Community informatics design, in fact, by combining social, communicational and 
technological aspects, must compose with the multiple aspects of a complex situa-
tion of which we will expose the main elements in the following chapters.
7.5.1  Community Informatics Design Exploratory Space
The present section is inspired by the APSI research program of the Quebec 
Government that works and seeks to define an analytical framework to understand 
the distributed and collaborative nature of what designers usually call the “design 
space” and that, within the APSI research of at the ACIL setting, refers to the com-
munity informatics design’s exploratory space. The design space concept (Sanders 
and Westerlund 2011) is useful to understand the designer’s act and the reflection in 
7.5  The Community Informatics Design’s Seven Spaces: General Principles

216
the action (Schön) that intervenes in design activities (Engeström 1999, 1987). With 
the collaborative design practice increase and the partnerships that put more and 
more non-initiated designers to contribution (Preece and Shneiderman 2009), our 
researches lead us to consider co-design space and community informatics design 
exploratory space concepts.
The co-design and the community informatics design space differ from the tradi-
tional “design space” concept because they can be conceptually and practically situ-
ated (Hutchins) at the very beginning of a design process (predesign), relying on the 
collective creativity of designers that work closely with non-expert designer com-
munities. These designers negotiate very complex issues like social change, organi-
zational transformations and DSS co-creation. They underline the importance of 
product, service and application instantiation in several fields that are more and 
more non-material like action and social practices. Our researches on action verbs 
in community informatics and in community informatics design, as noted in our 
different case studies and in both questionnaires, show that an analytical framework 
based on the notion of “community informatics design exploratory space” will 
substantially enrich our comprehension of community informatics design users’ 
needs by making the experience, the exploration and the experimentation in the 
community informatics design seven spaces, through these spaces, from the DSS 
design to its instantiation in a portal.
This analytical framework is also supported by a more general one developed in 
the Fall of 2010, we call the attribute constellation for the analysis and interactive 
construction of standardized educational technologies (CAPACITÉS), and serves as 
a basis reference framework for the development of this more operational analytical 
framework. Let us remind that CAPACITÉS develops a systematic and holistic 
model of the appropriation phenomenon and the DSS and virtual community design. 
All with the help of a schematization that situates the appropriation complexity and 
the design generativity on two continuums: one, vertical, goes from technology 
(hard) to the social (soft), and the other, horizontal, situates the community’s gen-
erative capacities in terms of needs and appropriation capacities of design tools. We 
will see later on how these modeled activities can inspire us in the creation of a 
concrete analytical framework, based on users’ practices our theoretical and empiri-
cal studies have shown us (case studies and questionnaires).
7.5.1.1  The Design Space’s Structure and Components
Therefore, from our works of the last 2 years, we suggest the community informat-
ics design exploratory space to be conceptualized like a scenario and possibility 
space to realize a DSS that extends beyond the expert design concept to cover a set 
of design activity uses by non-expert people and communities, according to three 
interpretations or definitions:
	1.	 The experiential design and navigation space in which design takes place (portal, 
infrastructure, social media platform).
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

217
	2.	 The design space, in terms of activities realized by users in the work of the designer.
	3.	 The design space of the possible futures often called “solutions space”. These 
solutions are updated by the imagination of participants and stakeholders, with a 
prospective attitude that aims the participants’ emancipation and the improve-
ment of social and organizational life conditions.
The expansion of the design space (Botero et al. 2010) towards the design in use 
(first questionnaire) and the design in community co-creation (second question-
naire), as community informatics design suggests, goes through mapping uses and 
strategic practices of the community informatics design, by diagrammatically posi-
tioning the activities identified by the verbs and collaborative design possibilities 
offered to participants on a continuum that goes from consumption to the proactive 
creation. By doing so, we suggest an analytical reference framework to understand 
and situate the interventions for community informatics design research and a visu-
alization tool destined to map the design activities. This represents a major result in 
our research because this new tool allows:
•	 To argue the fact that a community informatics design exploratory space is 
always actively co-built by a team of expert and non-expert partners and that it is 
explored by multiple collectives of actors through communication and social 
interactions and the social-mediatized participation by information technologies 
and communication.
•	 To discover the various co-design strategies through which the participants of the 
DSS construction conceptualize and instantiate the actors, the roles, the activi-
ties, the functionalities, the resources, the decisions, the management and gover-
nance modes as well as the strategies made explicit and available in the seven 
design subspaces in the community informatics design exploratory space. This 
design tool shows the functional and emerging relations between the seven 
spaces, the contemporary open innovation theories and the large perspectives 
offered to us to explicitly support collaboration and community informatics 
design activities through My Portal Col@b and its SADC. All these elements 
were surveyed in our questionnaires and discussion groups.
These activities are linked to the results of both our questionnaires and case stud-
ies. They are at the origin of our analytical framework and can be the object of the 
following questions in order to guide the action: In what type of activities are people 
involved in? What types of social appropriation of technologies do they favour? 
What are the needs to fill? What creativity, innovation and training processes could 
we put in place to support them? To build this framework, we had to refer to several 
lines of research like the collaborative ontologies, open innovation and budging 
theories on living labs, collaboration theories and collaborative and participative 
design, Gilles Lemire “verb theory”, the meta-design of Fischer and Shipman 
(2011), Fischer (2010), Fischer and Konomi (2007), Giaccardi and Fischer (2008) 
and Wenger et al. (2002), on “virtual habitats”, etc., which we have completed with 
our qualitative empirical studies and our observations on practices and digital skills 
in 86 practice communities in Quebec, Canada.

7.5.1.2  What People Do with the Tools
Figure 7.3 presents the basic dimensions of our analytical reference framework, the 
community informatics design exploratory space.
The vertical line represents the main elements of “what people do”, in terms of 
design action verbs and expressions that translate a vision per appropriation levels 
similar to the different design activities illustrated by the appropriation and the 
CAPACITÉS community informatics design evaluation chart. Indeed, the realities 
of the design worlds are located on a generative continuum that go from hard types 
of appropriation (structures, infrastructures and technological architectures) to soft 
types (interactions and social practices relative to collective and collaborative intel-
ligence), with the objective to illustrate and catalyse the different points of view to 
reconcile in the appropriation of the DSS tools and design because they are likely to 
complete each other in a co-creation and instantiation strategy. The horizontal line 
translates the dimensions related to the “generative capacities of tools appropria-
tion”, which seek to qualify the previous activities by letting us see they could be 
related differently to an evolutive continuum going from use (social media appro-
priation and collaborative tools) to community informatics design (co-creation, 
content production, tutorial guides and platform design). To elaborate more on the

operational vision, we illustrate the analytical framework by positioning three 
exemplary cases along the continuum:
	1.	 Reconfigure Excel as a design platform device, which corresponds to the action 
verb “innovate in the use”.
	2.	 Adapt electronic games engines to collaborative tools creation – here we “adapt” 
or “divert” platform uses according to new intentions or a “wrong use” (Samuelle 
Ducrocq Henri).
	3.	 Innovate in design and recreate, with the help of a collaborative platform like 
MediaWiki (Wikipedia), or use Joomla! as a SADC, in relation with the idea to 
“recreate” or “reproduce” applications by adding modules or extensions.
In this case, the particular position of a tool depends on the use conditions and 
the possibilities surrounding the activities to be realized, which provide users or 
observers with an action orientation in the exploratory design space. Let us look at 
it closer by defining each element expressed by a verb.
The inferior portion of these design activities refers to the composition/decom-
position issues, the decision-making on material and technological resources and 
the infrastructure’s identification/definition. It is easy to categorize alike activities 
usually associated with the tasks of design experts, the professional product designer 
or the computer expert. However, by identifying them in a socio-technical perspec-
tive, a softer categorization can emerge from it, if we rely on practice fields we have 
often relied on during our APSI researches: the science sector, technology and soci-
ety (STS), human-computer interfaces, computer-assisted collaborative work, inter-
active American design, participative Scandinavian design, software programming, 
community informatics and social computing. All these disciplines address issues 
related to socio-digital design and collaborative technologies.
Each time an analysis level is added, the superior element aims towards the soft 
perspective that represents more organizational or social design activities. Some of 
the superior level activities pose a problem for certain researchers or practitioners 
because we consider them like real design activities if we look at them from a strict 
product or technological applications point of view. Yet, according to the commu-
nity informatics design widened definition, which reconciles the social and the tech-
nological in the DSS construction or that considers virtual communities design as a 
socio-technical systems co-creation for the participative research action, these 
activities are considered more and more as design (Krippendorff 2007; Crilly et al. 
2008), especially according to the current “design thinking” movement (Brown and 
Duguid 1996, 2000, 2001; Brown 1992; Dunne), which currently penetrates the 
field of information systems and community information systems.
To define and synthesize these soft design activities, we use concepts taken from 
previously quoted authors and the results of our research on the action verbs we 
have extracted from our works on case studies and two questionnaires. These two 
theoretical and empirical perspectives give a coherence and a concrete foundation to 
the suggested analytical framework, as well as the digital skills analysis framework

(the skills triangle) necessary to support the passage towards the information 
society. Figure 7.3 illustrates these skills.
Program/Integrate/Write Modules: At the inferior level, like in the CAPACITÉS 
model, there is the digital and socio-technical systems design that requires a knowl-
edge of formal programming languages and software programing algorithms 
(Apache, PHP, C, C++, Java, JavaScript). These activities require specialized skills 
in the mastery of computer languages, data processing and information manage-
ment. They are performed by design decision-making, tools explorations and infra-
structure integration that affect the final technological choices (platforms, software, 
social media). In addition, they refer to coding activities and data abstraction pro-
cesses. The designs stemming from it are the product of very specialized profes-
sions and experts organizing modular reusable components for non-initiated 
communities. These modules provide high-level services for other design activities, 
especially through interface programing applications (API) users.
Using Modules and Libraries  At the second software design level, software com-
ponents are composed of different applications that perform relevant functions for 
DSS users and the community. These pro-software, tutorials and integrated com-
munity software rely on software libraries and underlying modular. These assem-
blies usually take place on the same computer. Their integration is performed by 
experts.
Assembling the Components  The implementation of certain software designs does 
not require specialized expertise or particular skills. In the last 5 years, several user 
guides and tool kits have been designed, modeled and realized with the intention 
that the non-initiated can design their own community information systems or, at 
least, configure and personalize turnkey virtual environments for a given objective 
(e.g. the “Platform Design Toolkit 2.0”, a work by Simone Cicero). However, at this 
stage, several applications require high-level digital skills because a programming 
expertise can sometimes be necessary. These various types of design activities aim 
to integrate new tools for personalization, the expansion of a platform by the addi-
tion of new components like plug-ins that allow the system to acquire new func-
tional capacities.
Combine/Reorganize  A complex ecosystem like the SADC evolves through com-
munication services and design connected one another in a flexible and agile way. 
The addition of mashups, a recent evolution of Internet applications that represents 
characteristic functionalities of the Web 2.0 and 3.0, can be considered as a set of 
new design services created by the addition of information or applications coming 
from other Web services offering Web API in free source code. Today, a good part 
of the design activities in Quebec’s virtual communities and elsewhere in the world 
focuses on digital skills development that combine and reorganize products and 
applications in a useful and innovative way. Several Web services like the ones from 
Google are used in the design of platforms and learning communities, according to 
various skills profiles we can define with the typologies and skills’ verbs identified 
in our APSI project. Google Docs and Google Maps become prime services to manage 
diverse types of design applications like remote education or practice communities 
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

221
because they now offer standard mashups that facilitate and accompany various 
design types. We can also think of YouTube, Facebook and Flickr.
Integrate  Most software tools we use daily in our work devices are connected in 
some way to other tools, particular configurations only the user can disclose. When 
we think about the whole diversity of circumstances and use situations that occur in 
all kinds of communities from a diversity of work tools and creativity, we can only 
remain pensive in front of the formidable growing integration of tools we will put at 
the service of various designs daily and the challenges our future innovation strate-
gies will face.
Configure/Personalize  This is an exploratory design space characteristic of the cur-
rent social Web evolution where more and more non-expert users/designers engage 
in all sorts of design activities, products, services, applications and DSS. Socio-­
digital media and collaborative software usually integrate several types of configu-
rations, virtual environments and technological assemblies that play a mediation 
and transformation for communications and collaboration. They also contain user 
guides and modes adaptable to various use contexts and personalized interaction.
Create Other Solutions  The discovery of replacement solutions designates the means 
users utilize to improve certain products, services or applications or perform using 
scenarios that transgress the collaborative platform limits. These solutions are not only 
creative; they are also a dynamic way to forge links together between the artefacts and 
the people around a common task or new ways to work as a team on a project.
Develop Partnerships and Social Agreements  A partnership is a contract between 
stakeholders that foresees the service provisions, the gathering of resources and the 
capitalization of knowledge in a collective project containing common development 
objectives. A social agreement represents a consensus surrounding a task or objec-
tive within a practice community or a DSS. Usually concluded at the initiative of a 
small leisure or work group, these agreements can evolve towards a more formal 
contract between two or several organizational entities (partners or stakeholders). 
The hashtags, the micro-blogging and the “working out loud” (Claudine Bonneau) 
allow to translate the collaborative work intentions or the tasks that force to “work 
together” and to collaborate.
Generate Social Practices  Social practices and communicational acts are human 
activity systems incorporated and mediatized by technological arrangement con-
figurations of all kinds. The community informatics design seven spaces and the 
parameters and dimensions of the instantiation strategy represent a way to describe 
associations between management, design, collaboration activities and various 
resources, strategies or tools. Social practices and communicational acts are exam-
ined under the conversational design angle that allows to make decisions and opera-
tionalize strategies. Social practices are self-organized activities that last in various 
times and space horizons. Therefore, they evolve towards a set of governance 
and ethics, through a series of social agreements, partnership agreements, behav-
iour patterns and design called to evolve as the DSS communities will promote their 
own growth with tools, conventions, conversational design and the co-construction 
7.5  The Community Informatics Design’s Seven Spaces: General Principles

222
of new social forms and online DSS. For example, the current increase of video-­sharing 
sites like YouTube allows to observe the phenomenal growth for the social link 
visualization need innovative social practices that invite members to invest and 
support audio-scripted visual conversations, by different types of use and visual 
languages, scenario annotation, visualization, etc.
The emergence of virtual design support environments and future ecosystems 
like the SADC creates new social situations for the design of community informa-
tion systems. The analysis chart here accompanies very well the community infor-
matics design instantiation strategy, because it refers to pragmatic activities where 
different actors, experts or not, are interested in concrete and relevant solutions for 
the future DSS construction. This means that original ideas, the imagination of new 
systems of human activities and the inspiration are innovation categories at the same 
level as technology design when we want to influence the dynamic composition and 
the instantiation strategy that guide the concrete articulation of the design’s explor-
atory space made of the seven design spaces. In the same spirit, all design subsys-
tems included in the community informatics reference model operate on an ancient 
tool basis as well as solutions, and new choices fall under the social and the technol-
ogy. The collaboration realized with the help of this analysis chart and design guide 
by a good concrete instantiation strategy with tools and technology gives an enor-
mous potential to the DSS projects in the near future.
The expansion of the traditional design space in an exploratory design space in 
community informatics design contains large social significations. If the “global 
generative capacity” of experts and non-initiated actors was increased by the open, 
fluid and collaborative participation of all sorts of stakeholders, in a plurality of 
society levels, types of use and design practices and that innovation communities 
would organize more DSS environments, if the traditional design space would 
evolve towards a continuous “design for all”, the repercussions would be felt on the 
entire set of digital skills in Quebec’s society. Thus understood, community infor-
matics design represents, for more and more people, a powerful value added strat-
egy of digital skills growth with the potential to positively influence the 
transformations that are currently happening in our society. We hope our research 
will contribute to this collective support of effort towards the information society.

In this section, we outline several perspectives of a relevant multi-methodological

matics design (or socio-technical systems design) in My Portal Col@b project and 
community informatics design framework.
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

The management and governance system of this important research program is 
particularly well adapted to the co-creation of infrastructures for computational 
social sciences and the development of the digital communication field. It relies on 
the collaborative network theory of knowledge management (Camarinha-Matos and 
Afsarmanesh 2008), the theory of social systems design (Banathy 1996) and the 
Scandinavian socio-technical approach of participative design (Whitworth and de 
Moor 2009). It helps organize in a creative way the design activities of a practice 
community according to a given ecosystemic and communicational environment. 
We can design the future ecosystem like a DSS design space that relies conceptually 
on Habermas (1973, 1984), theory of social action, Engeström’s activity theory 
(1987, 1999), on Luhmann social systems theory (1989, 1995) and Harvey’s com-
munity informatics design methodology, inspired by the works of Flood and 
Jackson, Checkland (1976, 1981), Checkland and Scholes (1990), Ackoff (1974), 
Ackoff and Emery (1972), Banathy (1987, 1996, 2000), Krippendorff (2007), Moles 
and Jacobus (1988) and Manzini (2007, 2009).
In the present section, we will do the synthesis of a diagrammatic representation 
of the socio-technical systems seven spaces of design we can consider like a class 
of particular collaborative virtual environments seeking to support new socio-­
technical or community informatics designers in their design activities of virtual 
environments in the socio-digital media context. Community informatics design 
supporting virtual environments becomes collaboration platforms that are essential 
for a new class of contributors/designers of the free software movement and for the 
knowledge users/producers, in a wide array of fields like tool configuration soft-
ware, online decision-making, problem-solving, social and cultural architectures 
and the planning of all sorts of online human activity systems like virtual communi-
ties, virtual university campus or business design platform.
We find all these activities in the heart of social sciences and the current digital 
communication. Mario Bunge (1999) calls them “socio-technologies” seeking 
social change and its planning. The implicit techniques can help to “virtualize” all 
kinds of projects or collaborative organizations, meaning they can support all sorts 
of complex projects that tend to use the media or social devices to manage, decide, 
perform follow-ups, realize the design, draw and work with the support of virtual 
environments in diverse fields and disciplines. In the case of our project, the com-
munity informatics design seven-phase spiral life cycle has served as a heuristic tool 
to evaluate the co-creation stages of a theoretical reference model, a governance 
model of the project and the semiformal instantiation framework of community 
informatics design, the object of the present book. Therefore, community informat-
ics design benefits from two great development phases we expose in the following 
sections: a creativity phase around the seven exploratory spaces and a concrete 
development phase containing a specific instantiation methodology allowing to 
define phase by phase a series of detailed stages to follow to create and make a DSS 
operational during its entire life cycle.
However, like most reflections and current design, orientations are either guided 
by artistic approaches that contain gaps in terms of heuristic foundations, either by 
approaches that are too formal or too systematically oriented towards technology. 
7.6  My Col@b/UQAM Portal Project Methodology Framework and Community…

224
We would like to suggest an approach that takes into account design collaborative 
activities that occur in all sorts of socio-economic activities, like virtual communi-
ties dedicated to transformational change and in particular socio-economics (like 
the field of social innovation). In this context, we would like to suggest a new meth-
odological orientation to help those new virtual environment designers (digital 
social systems and design platform) to discover products, applications, functional-
ities and assisting devices for socio-digital media design in a perspective of social 
innovation. Borrowing theorization elements from Checkland’s (1976, 1981; 
Checkland and Scholes 1990) flexible systems methodology from evolutive systems 
design, Laszlo and Laszlo (2004, 2007) and Banathy and Jenlink’s (2005) social 
systems design and Habermas’ (1984) social action perspective, it will allow us, as 
a relevant programmatic questioning, to define our vision and objectives while orga-
nizing My Portal Col@b’s collaborative design activities. Thus, we suggest seven 
iterative design spaces (Fig. 7.4) that represent the seven abstraction levels of the 
“design spiral”, iterative, emergent and never completed, specific to community 
informatics design.
We have started to apply this method to My Portal Col@b co-construction that 
will be the first Quebec example, a first application of this original methodology 
that will help build the first Canadian collaborative design platform and one of the 
first international one that will help socio-technical systems design dedicated to 
innovation. The seven reflexive and practical design spaces pose a series of ques-
tions at each research phase, which will help UQAM’s My Portal Col@b to incor-
porate their case studies, their need studies and their design patterns to design the 
best scenarios possible at a very early stage of the community informatics design’s 
development life cycle. This is what we call the first creativity phase that consists of 
describing the seven phases in detail. The second phase, less flexible, semiformal 
and more logical, is called the rational phase. The exploratory phase is the first 
feedback loop. After successfully describing these first activities, which consists of 
the main flexible community informatics design’s activity, the team of designers 
performs three other loops to get to the instantiation strategy. We will start with the 
first creativity loop by examining the seven design phase description.

Community informatics design lifecycle: an approach aiming to enable and guide the expert and 
non-expert users/designers through the domain of community informatics design foundations, theories, 
methodologies and applications. The design space and its seven sub-spaces enable an “optional field” 
to guide decisions in the spirit of action-research projects.

sharing in common virtual spaces. It is the analysis level where we start to examine 
the highest level of abstraction of a socio-technical system to co-build on a concep-
tual map of a type of system to build, objects to model and actions to define and the 
definition of the actors’ role (in accordance with our modeling methodology). In 
this space, our research is articulated around the questions such as: Why use the 
“design thinking” paradigm for the design research? What theories or what method-
ologies would be useful to us (design platforms for social innovation, collaborative 
networks or knowledge management network)? What applications and what tools 
could be useful to us? What types of evaluation could we put to contribution (quali-
tative research, case studies)? What are the boundaries of our theme, our subject or 
object and our virtual environment? Within the community informatics design proj-
ect framework and My Portal Col@b, it is about building an assisting community 
informatics design portal that, with the help of documentation and virtual communi-
ties case studies, aims to extract interaction, collaboration and design patterns use-
ful for the creation of a SADC.
We will define ourselves like a virtual community of communities (a meta mega 
community) that, in a collaborative portal, will co-build one or several collaborative

227
platforms or community informatics design assistance systems, which will later 
serve to build other virtual socio-economic communities and other business models 
of the network society, even other online and other innovation assistance socio-­
technical systems. Therefore, the suggested questioning reflects two parallel objects: 
our aspirations as a collaborative designers’ community organized in partnership 
around a portal (My Portal Col@b) and our own intentions and needs in the construc-
tion of a community informatics design platform (the SADC). In order to make the 
right decisions, the team could decide to create an “optional field reference source 
creation” (Fig. 7.5) a sort of help tool for decision-making incorporating theoretical 
perspective to develop (in relation also with the hierarchy of Love’s theories, in 
Chap. 6), as well as evaluate the society and analysis levels (with the CAPACITÉS 
model’s help in Chap. 5), the types of interaction with the partners and other systems 
to consider and the system characteristics and components of the design to be real-
ized according to the general objectives of the design process to develop.
Spiral 2, Imagine, aims to formulate the fundamental definition of a digital social 
system as socio-technical design ecosystem of community informatics platforms. In 
this spiral, research starts by asking the general questions: Why build a system dedi-
cated itself to the construction of another community informatics design platform? 
More precisely, what are our intentions and our aspirations at the service of our 
community and the entire Quebec society? What are the aspirations of the ACIL and 
the colab members, their partners, the designers’ communities and stakeholders, the 
government, citizens and enterprises? What is the common vision of all these peo-
ple in the portal construction and design of an assistance community informatics 
design system, according to the social, economic and cultural objective our SADC 
will strive to fulfil? What is the objective or the common intention that will give all 
the members (those who serve, those we want to serve) a commitment and a clear 
orientation regarding our project? What is the apprehended methodological perfor-
mance of community informatics design as presented in the present section? What 
are the other existing portals in our field? Where is the evolution of virtual environ-
ment for collaborative design assistance (or community informatics design)? From 
a detailed description and a synthesis of answers to these questions, we have formu-
lated a complete definition of the future system to develop. One of the conceptual 
tools we have developed for this spiral is the “diagrammatic reasoning with the help 
of conceptual mapping” concept (Fig. 7.6).
The reflexive practice methodology illustrated by Fig. 7.6 is close to Checkland’s 
idea of “rich image”. It allows a team with a collective intention to do the design of 
a new digital social system and to build these “imaginatics maps” in three phases to 
share visions and common representations of the system to build. From these reflec-
tions made in the first space, “Explore”, on the situation or the issue, the team:
	1.	 Experiences relevant scenarios or alternatives, suitable for the design situation in 
order to continue the analyses
	2.	 Observes similar systems while orientating its works on certain aspects, objects 
or norms to model according to the conditions, perspectives and constraints to 
foresee and the values of the users/designers group
7.7  The Community Informatics Design Spiral Process Socio-Dynamic

228
Spiral 3, Resolve, is a design space dedicated to the development of the 
collaborative design portal characteristics and the SADC. At the end of the 
project, the various basic definitions of information, technological and social 
architectures will merge into one single virtual design assistance environment. 
For now, we distinguish them, but when the designers’ community will finish the 
platform, it will be incorporated into the UQAM My Portal Col@b. The research 
now gravitates around the following questions: Who will be the users of both 
systems? What Web and training services as well as design applications should 
we develop for them? What should be their characteristics and functionalities? 
Where, when, how, for whom, why and with what results these services should 
be created? To whom will the system or its different parts belong? How can we 
distribute the property and collaboration? What will be the rights, duties and 
responsibilities of each of the users and partners? How can we establish good 
relations with the different members, partners and the entire Quebec society?

How will the portal be managed? Who will receive the potential benefits? What 
economic model will satisfy everyone? The answer to these questions will allow 
community informatics designers to explore more in depth these scenarios and 
alternative techniques and methodologies and to select those answering best the 
definition.
In Spiral 4, Incorporate, the space aims to promote the coordination for the 
design management of the project and the general organization of the partners’ 
communities’ activities (governance), both for My Portal Col@b and the SADC, in 
order to obtain the best results possible for both expected realizations. The analysis 
of the portal’s modules and the community informatics design platform functional-
ities will guide us in this emerging task of organizing our activities. The task now 
consists of executing the design of a subsystem, such as analysed and documented 
in the four previous spirals, and the one of another subsystem with the organiza-
tional capacity to operationalize and carry out its functions.
The management system designers seek to know what design will validate the 
system in the following tasks:
	1.	 Orientate the functions
	2.	 Energize, motivate and inspire people
	3.	 Interact with other people, virtual designers’ communities and the general socio-­
economic environment
	4.	 Ensure the availability of information and resources to share in the platform
	5.	 Engage the members of the new digital social system and the communities in a 
continuous organizational learning
Within the organizational design framework, we will ask ourselves the fol-
lowing questions: What individual, organizational and collective skills are neces-
sary to ensure the functions identified throughout the documentation phase? 
What people and partners (at the technological and material resources, software, 
and psychological, sociological and cultural level) possess these capacities and 
skills? How should we organize and incorporate the material, infrastructure, 
technological, human and material components in a viable relational arrange-
ment and a sustainable socio-­economic model? What financial, material and 
human resources to allocate to which person or which groups? What communi-
cational and organizational model promotes the construction of virtual and 
responsible ecosystems?
Spiral 5, Model, in the community informatics design context, is articulated 
on the modeling of four socio-technical subspaces, in the social action perspec-
tive of Habermas (1973, 1984), the activity theory of Engeström, the analysis 
framework of Knowledge Commons from Ostrom and Hess (2011) and commu-
nicational design (Krippendorf 2007; Harvey 2008; Crilly et al. 2008; Aakhus 
2007, 2010, 2011). It suggests that the preliminary analysis of systems and sub-
systems of design activities has been performed in the three previous spirals. Its 
objective is to accompany the design and optimize the conditions of a virtual 
environment for collaborative design (or community informatics design platform) 
7.7  The Community Informatics Design Spiral Process Socio-Dynamic

by exploring the tools, the devices and the ICT supporting the chosen design 
actions and activities and to suggest a series of technical orientations for the 
platform design. More precisely, we decompose the SADC in identical four 
subsystems with four distinct interaction spaces, each trying to map the respec-
tive categories of social action and design activities in an interaction design 
between designers and 3D visualization that serves to evaluate the state of 
progress.
Accordingly, we present a new design paradigm and digital environments co-
building methodology for the new collaborative design field we call “Community 
Informatics Design”, from which the implantation of a series of socio-digital media 
and Web devices will be part of the future SADC platform. It will be guided by 
social and communicational actions and the system of human activities for which 
the application’s objective is to support and accompany the users/designers com-
munity in the definition of its four interaction spaces. First and at this stage of our 
research, we believe this approach can be used in the following activities:
•	 Provide several relevant elements regarding the type of actions and the different 
design activities that should be supported by tools with open-source code and 
free platforms and social media
•	 Guide the selection and the decision-making associated with the development 
and the configuration of communication collaborative tools and platform design 
as well as the most powerful metaphors accountable
•	 Align data, information, knowledge, culture and values with the tools necessary 
to capture them, memorize them, process them, produce them, manage them, 
learn them and share them while keeping in mind the ethical orientations of the 
project and its underlying development principles
•	 Report clearly the project’s state of progress and inform the SADC participants 
and co-designers on the useful audio script visual support and on the social 
action and the completed design activities
•	 Create a matrix and a visual tool facilitating the realization of the four previous 
activities (Fig. 7.7)
In the SADC co-construction context, the 3D space will allow to model a com-
plex ecosystem containing a static geometric structure, objects and dynamic enti-
ties, hypermedia conceptual maps, avatars and digital social systems simulation 
tools (upcoming); all these elements interact with the holistic environment of the 
spiral 4, which incorporates itself recursively with the six other design spirals and 
is, itself, as we have already announced, from four design subspaces:
•	 The instrumental space, where users/designers execute the portal and the SADC 
design platform
•	 The communicational space, where users/designers communicate with each 
other and collaborate
•	 The discursive space (or conversational), where users/designers configure their

•	 The strategic space, in which we define the roles of users and participants, 
partners and the socio-dynamic of their inter relations
In this spiral and its four activity subsystems, the questions could be the 
following:
	1.	 In the instrumental space:
•	 What basic elements compose My Portal Col@b and the SADC design and 
all their abstractions, representations and metaphors?
•	 What tools (software, CAD, visualization) will best support the selection and 
management of the base and composition elements of the platform (My Portal 
Col@b and SADC)?
•	 From the users’/designers’ needs, case studies, documentation and the 
observation of competing transactional sites scenarios, how can we opti-
mize and make more efficient the collaborative behaviour of users and their 
interactions with design activities and specific members’ collaborative task 
helping tools?

	2.	 In the communicational space:
•	 What synchronous or asynchronous communication devices should we pro-
vide users with to facilitate the information, knowledge and communication 
sharing between users/designers?
•	 How to incorporate various types of users’/designers’ design uses to report 
(make them conscious) the various types of situation (in the work space, in 
the coordination of tasks, in the division of work, in the taking into account 
the situations of learning, context, particular environments of certain 
activities)?
•	 How to promote the sharing of points of view and ideas between participants 
with the help of a multitude of collaborative tools and participative social 
media (e.g. at the conceptual design level)?
	3.	 In the discursive space (and educational):
•	 How to best promote the transfer support and content sharing in the personal 
spaces and work sharing (and between life-cycle spaces, in the various design 
spirals, at various levels of society)?
•	 What tools to put to contribution to present the community informatics design 
to new users and put them in a permanent learning situation in an educational 
space? How to visualize and manage the acquisition of knowledge from con-
ditions, requirements and needs of users while doing the monitoring of these 
activities?
•	 What tools can we provide the users/designers with in order to annotate texts 
or any audio script visual document that could be part of the Dictionnaire 
encyclopedique des sciences et technologies collaboratives à l’heure du Web 
social (an online dictionary by Harvey will be soon available in the beginning 
of 2018 for the French-speaking audiences) and the construction of a collab-
orative ontology (especially the semantics elements associations of the instru-
mental space)?
	4.	 In the strategic space:
•	 How to define and divide the roles and skills, duties, responsibilities and the 
respective rights of each group or community regarding the shared knowledge 
by each of the partners?
•	 How to follow up on the roles and tools chosen to visualize the various types 
of contributions according to these roles?
•	 How to optimize the attribution of roles and adjust them in an evolutive way 
(training, text and visual animation, technical follow-up, programming, inte-
gration of theoreticians, practitioners, community informatics and collabora-
tive network experts)?
These important questions will guide the development of a generic and system-
atic framework in community informatics design.
Figure 7.9 illustrates the result of the answer to certain of these questions regard-
ing the modeling space as a rich complex matrix that, by the adaptation to the life

cycle of a given project containing its own architectures and basic functionalities, 
results in dimension monitoring matrices to take into account in digital social sys-
tems platforms. According to the team’s decisions and from the options offered, 
certain collaborative design scenarios could be considered from these elements. Let 
us note that the chosen project’s development cycle does not correspond exactly to 
the seven-phase model but that it is close since our team uses this base matrix 
(Harvey and Bertrand 2004) to model the evolutive architecture of the seven-phase 
design development cycle. It is inspired by Fig. 6.3 that describes the evolution of 
the disciplines intervening in the design with the help of the object/actors/actions’ 
model (Lemire 2008) (Fig. 7.8).
Spiral 6, Prototype, operationalizes the models of two new systems. The portal 
should be prioritized in terms of systems and content architecture, whether it is the 
partners’ ones or the ACIL ones, and the personal pages of professors and students 
of UQAM’s communications faculty. All must start on the same line, at the same 
place. The examination of the existing platforms and exemplary portals in the proj-
ects similar to ours was realized in the summer of 2011, and convincing case studies 
were led the following fall, in particular on various European and South African 
living labs alongside following the SADC development.
At this stage of the project, socio-technical design is close to the final state as we 
complete our design description of our portal as a collaborative work space and the 
SADC as a design support platform for this type of online organizational structure 
(and also various other types of DSS). Such description can be obtained by the addi-
tional development of five models:
	1.	 The system/environment model, birds’ eye view of relations and interactions of 
our portal and its community with the environment.
	2.	 The structural/functional model, the conceptual map and the objective architec-
ture, cleared by the tools described in the second part of this present book.
	3.	 The activity model (Trestini and Lemire; also incorporating Engeström 1987; 
Giddens 1984; Habermas 1973, 1984; Ostrom and Hess 2011; Krippendorff 
2007; Aakhus 2007, 2011; Harvey 2010) and relational arrangements either the 
relations of communities in terms of project and governance management.
	4.	 The process/behaviour model that gives the image in movement the way the 
inputs are transformed in outputs through community informatics design.
	5.	 The generic evolutive model that simulates the transition states (Lemire 2008) 
and the complex transformations of the system in order to help designers under-
stand the emerging socio-technical phenomena like the system state changes. 
This last model also incorporates the new tools and intelligent agents that accom-
pany the intentional and natural SADC evolution (that we will present in the 
second part of this chapter).
The five first integrated models collectively represent a description both static 
and socio-dynamic of the ACIL’s two systems (My Portal Col@b and the SADC), 
as well as their functional and operational integration modalities in real time and 
continuously: a real sociocultural representation of the new system and its envi-
ronment (Fig. 7.9). They also allow to lead a series of investigations that validate

the work of designers/community informatics experts in the difficult task of eval-
uating and validating the equation of different subsystems of portal architectures 
with the needs of users/designers and the viability of the SADC as a construction 
assisting platform of such digital social systems (Hatchuel et al. (2011) call por-
tals like the SADC “assisting platform to platform design”). The architecture 
vision is another way to model the necessary functionalities for the spiral 4 
model update. In accordance with our training objectives, the co-construction of 
this type of architecture should be taught to our students throughout the next 
years.
The last task consists of planning and formulating a prototyping and deploy-
ment plan of the various architecture subsystems and their components. The 
model in Fig. 7.9 (inspired by CoSpaces and TOGAF) aims to represent a struc-
ture and a socio-dynamic development model through a socio-technical architec-
ture similar to the one illustrated previously and to operationalize it, implementing 
it in a viable prototype for all participating actors. The creation of these complex 
architectures contains technological aspects but also social and organizational 
aspects. Their realization is part of the community informatics expert’s future 
task.
The space of spiral 6 is the penultimate task which consists of planning and 
formulating a prototyping and deployment plan of the new systems from the 
results obtained in spaces 4 and 5. It is not always easy nor useful to distinguish 
these three design spaces. However, it is often necessary to obtain a generic model 
of the portal and the SADC that are well operationally incorporated. This can only 
be verified by prototyping that must be inspired by a valid experimental plan 
made from different modelings of spiral 5. The various models are operationally 
incorporated in one single design model, empirically valid in part. At this stage, 
we know by representation that SADCs and citizen design work “on paper”, but 
we still have to verify their viability, their effective appropriation and their socio-
economic longevity, concretely and at a large scale, in multiple projects.
The distinction between the services, the functions and the processes of the digi-
tal social system is probably the most difficult thing to understand in this multi-­
model platform. The processes that describe the functionalities like commercial 
services and the user’s assistance functions are anticipated and provided. Functions 
can be applied at any level of granularity, while community and organizations’ ser-
vices are useful at a superior level where services and their interfaces are officially 
managed by researchers and the partnerships organization.
The last part of the platform architecture regroups the different points of view 
to be suggested to the architecture’s stakeholders, as diagrams that would be too 
tedious to reproduce here. The points of view are expressed to users by experts 
as groups of architecture blocks schematically represented as crossed matrices 
(e.g. a relations matrix and dependency links) or in a catalogue (as a checklist, 
we will see an example in Chap. 10). These representation tools facilitate the 
discussion on the SADC normative and ethical points of view and help the

knowledge sharing and the mutualization of meaning fields specific to the partners 
of the “five helices”.
Spiral 7, Deploy, represents the implantation and validation space of the proto-
type by society tiers and the large-scale deployment one (see the society tiers and 
the CAPACITÉS model in Fig. 5.3). It requires additional resources to succeed in 
the territories or the relatively vast collaborative networks. The implantation of our 
solutions and applications in a large number of users/designers communities spread 
in virtual communities of all types or evolving in virtual environments that are the 
Internet’s future is a task that should not leave all the space for improvisation. The 
current participative culture where everything is allowed must accept a design cul-
ture where the strength of network society, the information society, is channelled 
and catalysed in the best methodologies and in permanent learning of socio-­technical 
design of knowledge at the service of socio-virtual systems of the future. Figure 7.10 
suggests a simple model to visualize but complex and very useful for the evaluation 
and validation of a platform or a digital social system prototype and its design pro-
cess. This diagram can help the construction of dashboards and quantitative or qual-
itative visualization tools.

7.7.1  The Seven Spaces Work: Towards and Instantiation 
Methodology
Once the first creativity phase is over and the answer to all questions serves to imag-
ine the future system, its vision and objectives, the partners’ role and their interrela-
tions, the second creativity phase, supported by the spiral revision of the complete 
seven spaces cycle, has allowed us to have a preliminary idea of what portal to build 
and the future digital social system we would like to co-design. The first image we 
have obtained while doing this overview was to note the task was enormous. In fact, 
this first stage of planning was showing that in order to build a reference model, we 
had to enrich the theoretical foundations of community informatics and community 
informatics design. It was our first group’s activity. This also allowed us to realize 
that we did not have norms nor an architecture to build our portal. While noting the 
seven space cycle spiral was a good creativity tool to start establishing solid and 
detailed bases of the activities to perform, we quickly realized that we imperatively 
needed to focus on five main tasks:
	1.	 The situation diagnosis, through case studies and an investigation by surveys
	2.	 The discovery of multifunctional architectures in order to develop a valuable 
reference model, transdisciplinary and adapted to the DSS design
	3.	 The reference model articulation and specifically required functionalities
	4.	 Perfecting a methodology promoting collaboration and management in virtual 
environments
	5.	 A detailed instantiation methodology containing the activities to perform at each 
stage or phase, their description, the techniques, collaborative tools and the spe-
cific socio-digital media to support our definitions and our base ontology, the 
concepts’ specification, the functions in the form of verbs and tools and the 
design of the entire SADC structure
To do so, it was not necessary to answer all the questions asked in the seven 
spaces description presented above. Conscious of the extent of this mandate and its 
research hypothesis scope, our team has decided to answer it systematically and 
rigorously. Therefore, after a general high-level brushing corresponding to a first 
exploration of the seven spaces of design, the answers to the various questions first 
allowed us to make some adjustments to the seven spaces spiral and precise our base 
definitions and our glossary, while allowing us to maintain the process’s clarity and 
coherence. It was important to manage the different versions of our documents and 
that each one would share his finds and resources in order to ensure the entire work 
would be coherent and rational.
In the third feedback loop around the seven spaces spiral, our ACIL team has 
started to define, through case studies and group discussions, the functions system 
and functionalities that describe the precise activity articulation within a collabora-
tive creation process aiming the creation of a DSS. The base definition of a DSS and 
the digital social systems typology established by our team, supported by characteristics 
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

239
developed in the two previous creativity loops, provided us with the necessary basis 
to consider the functions that our portal/SADC should incorporate and harmonize, 
as DSS or socio-technical entities, and to make the relevant decisions in that sense. 
The entire evaluation step of the existing portals, support environments for the DSS 
design and the “Leonardo” case studies have helped us a lot in this task.
The questions we asked ourselves, for the online case studies and the discus-
sion groups, were similar to these: What key functions and sub-functions our 
DSS (portal/SADC) should have, in order to support and develop other DSS in 
the future? What services should we provide to the various types of users accord-
ing to the types of DSS to be built? One of the keys to our reflection was, as sug-
gested by Gilles Lemire, to think in terms of action verbs or activities to realize 
to provide the appropriate services and guide the activities in the two other feed-
back loops.
Another essential question was: To build the portal/SADC, how do these func-
tions and their sub-functions interact and how can we organize them in a functions 
system? In other words, we were looking to identify the main activity categories; 
the main roles played by the members of our team and our partners, within each 
“functional universe”; and the way to link them to the various activities and class 
role categories to create a discrete subsystem of activities such as an organized col-
laborative network or a viable digital social system. A systematic and disciplinary 
answer made all the difference in the world, giving us the rigour of a rational method 
coupled with the heuristic creativity.
The fourth feedback loop around the seven design spaces consisted of giving 
shape to the functions defined by verbs, architectures and communicational and 
collaborative activity diagrams inside a schematic and generic architecture (orga-
nizational structure) favouring management, coordination and the integration of 
roles and activities in My Portal Col@b, as well as the community informatics 
design of other various types of DSS. The generic task consisted of incorporating 
the social and communication sciences dimensions to the management, computer 
sciences and public relations ones. After this final iteration in December 2011, we 
produced a general outline with all the components noted in our research to opti-
mize the construction of DSS and of the portal. It is the entire DSS model, the rich 
picture (Checkland and Holwell 1998; Checkland and Scholes 1990), serving as a 
conceptual attractor to guide the daily, tactical and strategic DSS operations that 
constitutes a crucial step towards the updating of the ideal system visualized by the 
designers’ community in space 1 and the first iterative loop.
At this stage of our presentation, it becomes more and more obvious that strate-
gic conversational design produces language acts that generate generative detailed 
design processes and activity structures (analysis and research) that guide the DSS 
co-design. It is in that iterative modeling trajectory that the first results emerge from 
the first feedback loops to multiply as the conversational design gives rise to new 
operating concepts. This creative and iterative approach involves a trajectory that 
runs through the seven spaces in a transitory process, non-linear, through the over-
view spiral and the spirals represented by the spaces 1–7, by performing loops 
7.7  The Community Informatics Design Spiral Process Socio-Dynamic

240
sometimes clockwise and sometimes counterclockwise of the conceptual map in a 
recursive dynamic of exploration and continuous creation.
While continuing to benefit from our readings, our document researches, our 
syntheses, our conceptual analyses and our results from the different spaces, we 
found ourselves committed in a self-generative process that is very appropriate for 
the reception of internal energy of the team and the lab members and to the exter-
nal forces that structure the action landscape of partners and the socio-economic 
environment. It is the ethics conversation that makes the trust evolve between the 
project’s partners and that contributes to the changes that promote the emancipa-
tion of each at the service of everyone’s well-being. To better understand or visu-
alize the community informatics design approach, we can compare it to rivers 
growing as other water courses join it, visible or invisible contributions, tangible 
or intangible, more or less important or relevant. The members and the partners 
interconnect while continuing to engage in the operational DSS aspects, progres-
sively translating the rich starting image into programs, functionalities and activi-
ties to organize, to plan, to instantiate and to implement. This is what we will 
show in more detail in the following sections. We will see that between the meth-
odological creativity phase and the rational methodological one, there is a logical 
link where the mind starts from the community informatics design’s strange effect 
to enter more deeply into the more familiar methods and where the activity con-
trol processes, action verification monitoring and RD innovation capture are 
closer to logic than to flexibility. We will see that this only constitutes a logical 
passage between the implicit creativity of community informatics design, its 
translation into a more formal methodology and its potential passage into method-
ological ways or technical recipes accepted by the habit (e.g. the interview tech-
nique in social sciences or the research action). Thus, to synthetize these 
considerations, we will say that dynamic communities and enterprises must make 
a large place to creativity and innovation.
The creation of DSS is an innovation in itself, and the use of community 
informatics design is another one. We will take it into account in our reference 
model. We must, however, use these approaches to systemize more inventive 
methods at the beginning and that through conceptual maturation and practice 
become more logic and more operational in the value creation of the enterprise 
and designers communities. Potentially, the heuristic method evolves towards a 
more rational methodology (e.g. governance) to enter in the culture of a field 
research (social communication) and, finally, become an accepted and validated 
method by theoreticians and practitioners of the field make it a second nature 
(norms). It is in this precise sense that we can say “if you don’t move forwards, 
you go backwards”, showing that the ­methodological pluralism and novelty can 
be salutary for organizations and society. The new articulation suggested by a 
new philosophy of community information systems which consists of amalgam-
ated interpretative paradigm, socio-critical approaches and neopositivism can, 
despite several obstacles, hold innovation and value for the entire socio-eco-
nomic life.

7.8  From the Creativity Phase to the Rational Phase: A Basic 
Terminology
In this section, we will not come back on the theoretical and historic contributions 
related to the establishment of a reference model for community informatics. It is a 
task we will perform in other sections dedicated to the virtual organization architec-
ture and to community informatics models. However, as we mentioned previously, 
a common problem in social sciences and in sciences in general is the absence of 
concepts and a common vocabulary as well as the introduction of new concepts 
coming from other disciplines to create a common conceptual base that might add 
even more confusion instead of clarifying things. We will therefore start with defin-
ing a basic terminology we can also find in the dictionary.
The establishment of reference models for the DSS community informatics 
design if often cited among the most urgent needs for the conceptual consolidation 
and the sustainable development of the field. Paradoxically, there does not seem to 
have many studies nor consensus from the community informatics fields, informa-
tion systems and social computer sciences nor on what we understand as “reference 
model”. In fact, our document study brings us to note that as for social science and 
communication research methods, this term represents very different notions from 
one researcher to the next which is translated by the varied perceptions of its utility 
for our researches. Therefore, it was necessary for us to reach for our dictionaries 
and the Internet to clarify the notion of reference models.
This task is far from being easy because confusion is king in the entire basic 
terminology of these fields. Knowing the creation of a field always requires basic 
vocabulary, we had included this important task in our research proposal of 2010 in 
the APSI program of MSG. For example, the terms “reference architecture”, “refer-
ence structure”, “system”, “system architecture”, “architectural structure” and sev-
eral others intersperse with more or less overlaps. Without pretending to give a 
definitive sense to these terms, we believe it is useful to give a few definition ele-
ments and “generic orientation”:
Model  Environment, system or entity more or less complex from the physical, 
organizational, social, communicational or logical world. Traditionally, a model 
refers to certain particular aspects of a reality phenomenon. Two or three models of 
the same reality or same phenomenon can be essentially different or divergent, 
especially regarding the required conditions, modeling perceptions, conceptual 
approaches, theoretical or epistemological frameworks, ontology, aesthetic 
­preferences, designers’ experience or empirical studies. Accordingly, a model’s 
users must understand well its underlying base intentions, its application context, its 
postulate and its validation criteria. There are various models at various detailed 
abstraction levels (it is the community informatics case), ranging from very abstract 
general concepts (praxeology, axiology) to representations very close to the entity 
to be modeled (a portal or a virtual environment) or its implantation (a collaborative 
design guide for the portal).
7.8  From the Creativity Phase to the Rational Phase: A Basic Terminology

242
Reference Structure  In the wider sense, work framework or conceptual arrangement 
that accompanies or frames another structure or activities subsystem. In the field of 
modeling (organizational or in information system), a reference structure can be 
considered like an “enveloping” contextual framework that may contain a certain 
number of subsystems, partial models, organizations or design patterns, procedures, 
norms, rules and tools (modeling language, DSS theory, ethics rules).
Reference Model  Generic abstract representation that helps understand the entities 
of a system or a phenomenon (e.g. a system of human activities) and the significant 
interrelations of these entities (people, resources, functions) within a field and with 
other precise models, relevant for the particular cases of the same field. It is prefer-
able to find reference models on a small number of unifying concepts so they can 
serve to other research groups to be usable online. In the case of digital environment 
models, as well as in education, for E-learning and for tailor-made training, to 
explain and analyse cases and make scenarios and most of all, to develop socio-
technical human activities systems like DSS knowledge infrastructure, a well-built 
reference CID framework could be of great utility.
A community informatics reference model and applied science of digital social 
systems’ construction (collaborative networks and virtual organizations) designate 
a generic conceptual model helping to synthesize and formalize concepts, transdis-
ciplinary principles and better practices for the development of DSS. It is destined 
to have authority and provide development perspectives, design and animation 
guides, means to facilitate the co-creation of models centred on various aspects of 
the DSS as well as on the different types of architectures and implantation models 
useful to the development of specific DSS. A reference model is generic; its goal is 
not to apply itself directly to concrete cases but, instead, to serve as a base for other 
more concrete models, closer to the DSS construction cases, for example. It is the 
community informatics design instantiation methodology that gives the guidelines 
for the constructions of the DSS (see Sect. 7.2).
Architecture  Abstract and schematic description of a system or a model; at a logi-
cal level, it tends to indicate the system’s structure, functions of its components, 
their relations and their oppositions. Serving the development of the system, the 
architecture is centred on the “construction of a given system” and must be updated 
according to various levels of theoretical or practical levels. The word “architec-
ture” is often used in engineering, architecture of buildings, software engineering, 
computer science infrastructure, in technology and management, in design of busi-
ness ecosystems, in multimedia creation and in video game design. The role of 
architecture evolves with the professions and the fields of expertise because it 
depends on the various principles of development and available technologies. With 
community informatics design, we witness an accelerated transdisciplinary network 
between the Internet information technologies. Various types of expert and non-­
expert architectures will emerge from it in the next years as we refine our collabora-
tion mechanisms with the creativity tools of the social Web.
An architecture can be descriptive or prescriptive. Descriptive, it helps the critic 
systems analysis and the evaluation of the impact of a given elements’ configuration 
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

243
on human relations, organizational strategies and social change. Prescriptive, like in 
the community informatics design, the social architecture of our future virtual 
environments will force the possible fields with scenarios and particular forms of 
systemic arrangements and relational entities with emerging and original processes.
Community Informatics Design Reference Architecture  Not to be mistaken with the 
DSS architecture resulting from it. Channelled architecture in the seven design 
spaces have the objective of structuring globally and specifically the sub-architec-
tures (participative, technological and organizational) in a particular field (here, we 
refer to the modelization of DSS infrastructure during co-design activity). It defines 
a unified particular terminology of action verbs, functionalities and roles of each 
system’s component. By doing so, it provides elements corresponding to the differ-
ent behaviour patterns or communicational activities specific to a social system, it 
suggests various architecture models accompanied by type scenarios or exemplary 
practice cases and it suggests a methodological design. The methodological con-
figuration of community informatics design represented in the seven design spaces 
is the base architecture on which we can realize particular architectures’ design 
(collaboration, decision-making, visualization, management) for a type or a cate-
gory of DSS covered by community informatics and its social systems typology 
presented in Sect. 6.4. Thus, in the DSS field, a reference architecture for their 
design and management and for the virtual organizations represents the “structure”, 
the principles and the guidelines to be followed by members to define the concrete 
architectures of a given DSS. The parallel creation of a data base for the reference 
architecture and the derived architectures (activity subsystems) also introduces the 
idea of exemplary practices to renew, reusable entities or reusable, “construction 
blocks”. This helps us take our distances regarding the approaches that do not take 
into account the valuable theoretical ones or the ones that do not learn the lessons 
from experience, and this forces the designers to “reinvent the wheel” every time.
7.9  The Community Informatics Design Reference Model
The creation of a virtual community, an innovation community or any other digital 
social system or platform is a design and dynamic modeling process that must pro-
mote the best possible collaboration between members and partners. Community 
informatics design represents in itself an innovation process created by several 
orders’ collaborative activities and at various organizations levels ranging from the 
largest collaboratory social system even overflowing the national borders. It must 
allow to create value for the stakeholders and increase their human, social, organiza-
tional, technological and financial capital. Community informatics design creates a 
value by offering services through a service portal, in the shape of a community 
informatics design assistance system. These services are provided as theories, con-
cepts, methodologies, techniques, design reference guides or toolkit that favour the

244
establishment of common activity grounds for the interaction, communication, 
cooperation, collaboration, management and the commitment of the DSS members.
After defining what a reference model in community informatics design is, we 
will now focus on the practical means to orientate ourselves to make it into concrete 
instantiation which constitutes one of our main expected realizations from the APSI 
program (the reference framework and the discovery of development norms that 
correspond to the hypothesis 2 of the research proposal). In the following sections, 
we will then define and present in detail the entities, elements and key components 
of community informatics design. These elements are the required conditions for 
creation, modeling, design and the management of a DSS in the entire life cycle of 
the community informatics design. In doing so, while presenting an approach and a 
complete realization architecture, we will describe the concrete architecture of My 
Portal Col@b and its contents that become our first guide or SADC prototype.
Let us note that we do not pretend to drain the reference model structure; we will 
confine ourselves to process the elements that were brought to the attention of our 
team to establish this first reference framework in the form of a design guide. The 
model could be improved and completed as part of future researches.
7.10  The Community Informatics Design Endostructure
The endogenous elements (or endostructure, the exostructure being the environ-
ment) are characteristic properties of the community informatics design that can 
help describe the DSS design elements and components. Initially, this modeling and 
DSS design vision rely on social sciences and Mario Bunge’s social systems defini-
tion (1997, 2000, 2004a). Bunge situates the social system as systems that refer to 
the emergence concept and the emerging properties, concepts that are also related to 
the digital social system’s concept. He states that each object of the real world is 
either a system, either a system’s component. Accordingly, the emerging properties 
in the creation of social systems and digital social systems are always the properties 
of other systems in interaction. In accordance with this dynamic and interactionist 
vision of the systems he presents in the form of a symbolic equation called CESM, 
Bunge states we can model and entire complete system “s” in the following way:
C(s) = Composition: the entire parts of the systems
E(s) = Environment: the entire elements other than the ones contained in s and that 
act on some of the components s or are affected by them
S(s) = Structure: the entire relations, especially the links, within the components of 
s or among the elements of E(s)
M(s) = Mechanisms (or functions): the entire process that rules the behaviour of s
A mechanism is a process or a “function”. Based on the precision given by 
Bunge (2004a), we keep the term “function” to describe the mechanisms essential 
to the survival of the system that constitutes the essence of its activities. For exam-
ple, one of the main specific functions of a digital social system is to allow cohesion, 
trust and collaboration between its members which is not necessarily the function of 
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

245
a collaborative tool that has the purpose to build it. These functions can vary in time 
and in space and find themselves also in other types of systems (computer of non-­
human agents).
Departing from these foundations and various collaborative network modeling 
frameworks and DSS like the ones from ARCON and Ecolead (VBE), the works of 
Romero and Molina (2010, 2011) and Romero et al. (2008), TOGAF, CoSpaces, 
etc., the ARCON European project suggests a modeling vision that reuses elements 
similar to the Bunge model for the subsystem called “endostructure”. Its elements 
are:
	1.	 The structure, which includes the network structure of the DSS collaborative 
network and its structural topology in addition to people, their roles and their 
internal or external relations, structure we have named “situational topology” in 
another book (Harvey 2006a, b in Proulx et al. 2006) and links between the vir-
tual spaces and the physical and human elements
	2.	 The composition, which refers to all the parts of the system in terms of resources 
like humans and their skills, social media, creativity tools, collaboration tech-
nologies, information, knowledge basis, ontologies and specialized glossaries
	3.	 The function, which, according to a DSS’ characteristics, designates the proce-
dures (code of ethics, management modes) and the methodologies (monitoring, 
evaluation) at the base of the functions and operations related to the seven phases 
of the life cycle
	4.	 The behaviour (or mechanisms),which covers the entire principles, politics and 
management or governance rules that orientate and constrain community infor-
matics design and the DSS, the community informatics design being the element 
that catalyses the DSS “socio-dynamic”.
7.11  The Structural Modeling
The structural modeling helps to identify a diversity of actors, partners, social roles, 
relations and other structural characteristics, as well as their reciprocal links. The 
DSS actors are people or organizations that are members or that perform commu-
nity informatics design:
	1.	 The business world, which provides products, services or applications on the 
market and participates to the creation of organizations or virtual institutions 
with a lucrative objective
	2.	 The non-profit institutions or NGO, which participates in the DSS construction 
to obtain qualitative benefits like social capital
	3.	 The partners’ institutions or project support, like lawyers, computing consultants 
or in social media information, Internet services providers, health services, 
insurance companies, ministries like MESRST or the Conseil du Tresor in 
Quebec, Canada, the association sector and the ecological organizations
7.11  The Structural Modeling

246
If we go a bit further, several roles can be played by DSS actors. Here are a few 
of them we also find in the DSS community informatics design:
	 1.	 The members make up the users’/designers’ core base or “design organiza-
tions” that are registered as participants in good standing with the community 
informatics design activities, especially the generation, sharing and the content 
arrangements.
	 2.	 The administrators, executives and directors are in charge of mobilizing and 
engaging the members in design activities, modeling, evolution, exploitation, 
animation, cooperation and promotion within the DSS. Among other functions, 
they determine and meet the needs in terms of skills and practical and collective 
abilities associated with the DSS development. They seek to recruit and invite 
potential partners, they ensure day-to-day management of the general DSS pro-
cess, and they suggest means of settling disputes and lift the communicational 
obstacle in the community and the subgroups. They also detect leaders and the 
processes that promote communityship, they ensure the implementation of 
capitalization mechanisms (financial, technological, knowledge and know-­
how), and, finally, they define viable common policies.
	 3.	 The director of knowledge management is responsible for the data base or the 
digital library; he takes care of the production, classification, knowledge pro-
cessing as well as their sharing modalities, their updating and their diffusion to 
various publics or target communities according to the public or private data, 
information and knowledge status.
	 4.	 The collaboration broker has the responsibilities of discovering partnership 
possibilities and skills to acquire through means of new collaborations, by 
using strategic monitoring, marketing and public relations around the commu-
nity informatics design skills, and to recruit potential producers, consumers and 
designers.
	 5.	 The DSS planner is responsible for making the necessary digital skills for the 
DSS long-term management and expansion. Once it is built, by using strategic, 
commercial or technological monitoring, alliances or the useful partnerships 
for the evolution of the new virtual organization (identified by the broker), the 
planner can now think for the long-term policy options.
	 6.	 The coordinator is in charge of the DSS management during the co-design and 
throughout the construction and evolution life cycle, in order to meet the func-
tioning and collaboration needs, to answer the emergencies with the 
­administrators’ assistance, to ensure the execution of the action plan and to 
organize workshops.
	 7.	 The experts/consultants are responsible of various specific expertise compo-
nents, like the computing infrastructures, media design or the use of socio-­
digital media in public communication in order to assist the DSS community 
informatics designers and the administrators.
	 8.	 The services providers have the responsibility to provide an array of services 
like the Internet connection, collaboration support tools and development 
mechanisms appropriate to the various actors.
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

247
	 9.	 The DSS ontology provider is in charge to define, with action verbs and an 
appropriate terminology, tools, services and common applications to the differ-
ent community or DSS members.
	10.	 The innovation manager has to identify the government policies, methodolo-
gies and social innovation guides, products or processes and to ensure their 
appropriation in the DSS culture.
	11.	 The cultural animator has the duties of planning the meetings, interventions 
and the cultural mediation actions and to provide the necessary tools for the 
members’ commitment as well as establishing support and change tools pro-
moting the emancipation of members and the quality of community life.
	12.	 The partner institutions strive, as per the agreements and contracts, to main-
tain the DSS in place; to make it evolve by the resources service and the 
expertise in their field and by the upgrading of technologies, according to 
trends and the evolutions of the members’ needs; to suggest solutions; and to 
provide optimal means of organizational or community development, in order 
to assist members and administrators in their tasks according to the specific 
DSS objectives.
	13.	 The guests are the external organizations solicited by the DSS to play different 
roles in the information research and in the council related to the necessary 
grants for the longevity of the initiatives. They are eventually invited to be part 
of the DSS as full members.
	14.	 The accountant is responsible for the budget, the opening of a potential com-
mon account, the respect of the costs according to a schedule and activities, the 
financial arrangements for grants and the respect of the norms and ethics proce-
dures in this field.
7.12  The Community Informatics 8Cs
These different roles pose a problem in their interrelations and their complementar-
ity in the community informatics design, in the perspective of collective intelligence 
and collaborative intelligence (network collaborative practices). The approach cho-
sen by the UQAM’s ACIL at first was to be inspired by the important works of 
Wolfgang Hofkirchner (2007, 2008, 2013) and de Christian Fuchs (2003, 2004, 
2008), two theoreticians of the Ecole de Salzbourg who favour a social science 
approach focused on the “Internet research”. These two researchers use three con-
cept categories related to the production and management of social-mediatized 
information by the ICT: cognitive, communicational cooperative processes (the 
3Cs). Our recent works show that these very important complex systems thinking 
concepts must, however, be completed with another series of integrator concepts 
that serve to report in a more specific way the precise “relation categories” that 
intervene in the DSS community informatics design. Therefore we present a brief 
definition of these concepts (the 8Cs) while suggesting to take it into account to 
7.12  The Community Informatics 8Cs

248
describe the interdependence that takes place on the collaborative continuum 
occurring in the contexts of the member networking and the design partners:
	1.	 Connectivity: Structure of various DSS socio-technical entities and the infra-
structure process that deploys the base technological architecture for exchanges, 
through the ICT, allow to unify two people, a group or a community in an 
exchange process and creative conversation generating common benefits.
	2.	 Conversation: Discursive process, widely communicational, that acts as semiotic 
mediation tool within the cooperative, collaborative, creative and cultural activi-
ties. These activities are essential to understand and capture the interaction and 
interdependent design patterns in the social fabric and more particularly in the 
DSS construction. The use of the activity theory (Engeström 1999; Lemire 2008) 
as a reference framework to understand the mediation role of conversation and 
artefact design as a human activity system (DSS) represents one of the substan-
tial inputs of our research. We will come back to it further along.
	3.	 Cognition (social): Process that, in the very wide sense, refers to the mental, 
especially emotions, motivations and the reflections that happen at the individual 
at intra-subjective level. Cognition considers the actor like an information pro-
cessor. In the case of inter-individual behaviours, like in a situation of interac-
tions between two partners, for example, we may talk about the beginning of a 
consensus building, the emergence of collective intelligence or a distributed rep-
resentation. The information generation is more considered like a sense and 
shared meaning production. In virtual communities, if individual intelligence is 
the antecedent of collective intelligence, collaborative intelligence and the action 
intentionally oriented represent its outcome. We then talk about social cognition 
(Houde et al. 1998), the field of knowledge and know-how related to people that 
study interpersonal relations between individuals identified by personal and psy-
chosocial parameters (roles and status). In the DSS case, they are in computer-
mediatized interaction where the functions assumed by members within a design 
activity or a DSS are studied in the setting of creativity tools appropriation and 
computer-mediatized social collaboration that defines new social communica-
tion contexts, mutual positioning, cooperation and collaboration.
	4.	 Communication: Process of multiple interactions within a group of individuals 
or a community. These plural processes can be the object of a multi-level analy-
sis of abstraction and practices at different tiers of society (see Fig. 5.3). They are 
information generativity and meaning evolution processes resulting from the 
coupling of cognitive subjects and social cognition mechanisms. For several 
years, they are the objects of studies, mainly in the computer-mediatized 
­communication field (but also in the fields of Internet, social Web social, socio-­
digital media, the STS sector, computer-mediatized collaborative work (TCAO) 
and human-computer interfaces), all illuminating and stimulating fields for com-
munity informatics design and the DSS.
	5.	 Cooperation: Formal, evolutive and integrating process that concerns the supra-­
individual level and favours the information production and sharing and that 
emerges from synergetic effects (Fuller and Heylighen 2007) of communicating 
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

249
and conversational actors. At the beginning, this research theme was the TCAO 
ones, computer-mediatized collaborative work and even the very important 
Anglo-Saxon movement of computer-supported cooperative work. In commu-
nity informatics (Harvey 2008), the statement of an insufficient apprehension of 
technological reality incorporated to the social reality has recently led research-
ers to suggest the notion of user producers (produser) and ourselves to suggest, 
with other researcher groups, the term user/designer (Harvey 2010) to show the 
fact that humans are not only connected by computers but the real nature of this 
connection is human and cooperative. The consumer and designers’ convergence 
and of the increase of the non-expert members’ role in design and modeling of 
new virtual environments and DSS are the new Web application and social 
media’s real underlying strength. The cooperation between actors is intense, but 
it only involves limited resources.
	6.	 Collaboration: Process relying on mechanisms and previous processes to push 
cooperation further until not only the sharing of objectives and common activi-
ties but also the risks, resources, responsibilities, benefits and sanctions associ-
ated to them. Collaboration often underlies long-term activities and intangible 
and informal relations. It commands a common mission between partners and an 
exhaustive planning and commonly established. Communication channels and 
creativity tools are commonly identified and acquired. A collaborative structure 
or a particular DSS type determines the roles and the authority structure. The 
sharing of resources makes the leadership and power problematic an important 
issue. The intensity of sharing and synergies is reinforced; we are all on the same 
boat. Community leadership and synergy can result in communityship, a more 
explicit and global sharing of all constitutive elements of a virtual organization 
or a DSS conceptualized like a generative community. The results exceed those 
of individuals who act alone; in some cases, the benefits are more substantial 
than those of the cooperation.
	7.	 Culture: In design, processes through which we favour the global creativity of a 
group and massive innovation in the DSS according to the values, the customs 
and the habitus that prevail. We can define a social creativity process like a cul-
tural product, applications and social innovation development process. Thus, 
the creativity process is not the prerogative of certain genius individuals but a 
sociocultural generic skill to analyse, evaluate and promote at the level of an 
entire community or an organization. Furthermore, innovation processes must 
align (generative fit idea) with the strategies of other partners or stakeholders 
whose infrastructures, practices, habitus, technological customs, structures and 
creation processes harmonize in the best possible way the organizational cul-
tures likely to converge or diverge. Then, with the help of Engeström’s activity 
theory (1987, 1999), evaluate the sociocultural, economic, practical and distrib-
uted nature of the creation collaborative process in the context of the media and 
the socio-­digital networks (as mediational entities). Therefore, we will monitor 
the exploration, commitment, clarification, semantics and representational 
negotiation, design conversations and the actors’ argumentation, the evolutive 
creation mechanisms and the continuous redesign. The community informatics 
7.12  The Community Informatics 8Cs

250
designer and the community informatics expert must pay a particular attention 
to the individuals’ commitment mode in the collaborative creativity processes 
according to the diversity of the partners’ organizational cultures and the new 
ways of working in the computer-mediatized collaboration context and the 
computer-mediatized social participation. Ironically, social culture and creativ-
ity must also be the object of a modeling and an architecture.
	8.	 Contract: A major difference between the community informatics design of DSS 
networking knowledge and the traditional object-oriented approach is the notion 
of co-responsibility of collective behaviour, common communicational acting or 
collective generative capacity (Van Osch and Avital 2010a, b, c). Usually, a con-
tract exists to precise the respective obligations of a service provider and his 
client. In the agreement formulation, one must specify the calendar, the budget, 
the conditions and the methods of each of the partners. However, what is a little 
disturbing is that beyond the traditional characteristics, the specification notion 
must be processed in the most open and flexible way in the DSS environments, 
because community information systems that support the DSS involve fields that 
are a lot less formalized than the service delivery in technology or engineering in 
addition to put a wide diversity of roles at risk which complicates the strategic 
alignment of all the actors on a shared intention. Fields like social participation, 
culture, human relations, social creativity, innovation and the DSS structure 
belong more to a research and development context where everything can be put 
“in a contractual can” ahead of time and where the very own nature of the dis-
covery collaborative context of activities to realize cannot be precisely defined 
without threatening the project’s success. It is a paradox. Our APSI research 
seeks to increase the precision of these systems development, but at the same 
time, we must admit that the entire operation must play on the level of precision 
and abstraction of each subsystem or virtual organization or DSS’ field in order 
to align them in a community informatics design strategy. Therefore, the collec-
tive action precision and imprecision are two benefits to reconcile in a partners’ 
agreement.
7.13  A DSS Semiformal Typology
Finally, the community informatics design approach tries to rely on the distinction 
between several types of DSS which brings us to summarily propose a virtual orga-
nizations’ typology (semiformal). A future research should bring us to perfect this 
typology from better formalized criteria of social virtual classification forms. 
Among the important criteria, let us mention time, space, hierarchy, heterarchy, 
institutionalization, generative capacity, information, entropy, the degree of free-
dom, the evolutive digital skills, the culture, the structuring degree, procedures and 
the work division/coordination, management modes, the size and the duration. 
Without justifying our evaluation criteria, because we will come back to it in another 
book, here are some DSS types that can be used as starting points for our students 
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

251
and the users. Our first analyses show the emergence of more stable forms in the 
DSS in the last few years: institutions (Wikipedia), virtual communities (Facebook), 
social movements (Twitter) and projects (Sun Teams). Here are a few emerging 
generic structures, more or less stable in time and geographic space but likely to 
help the structural modeling of a DSS and the decision-making:
•	 The high activity team accomplishes a certain number of intensive tasks within a 
certain delay.
•	 The project team accomplishes a specific cooperative project within a certain 
delay.
•	 The collaborative work group has formal and organizational design objectives to 
execute activities with an added value and to deliver products and services.
•	 The informal network’s goal is to produce and share business information, estab-
lish trust links and rekindle relations with new partners.
•	 The collaborative network is an alliance made of a wide diversity of entities 
(organizations, partners, people), largely autonomous, geographically distrib-
uted and heterogeneous in terms of environment, culture, social capital and 
goals. The cooperation is supported by the ICT.
•	 The organization in collaborative networks (online institutions) is a network of 
long-term partnerships collaborating to projects or common R-D. The objectives 
and activities are commonly defined in a “peer-to-peer network” of partners. The 
organization and institutionalization forms can be deep and durable. The rules 
and structures are well defined by a formal or relational contract, and the partici-
pants develop an identity and a strong sense of belonging on computer-assisted 
collaborative work platforms (e.g. Wikipedia). A strategic alliance contract 
between multiple actors, structured around a design platform, is a possible exam-
ple. The free source code movement and the free software DSS movement are 
examples of global network organizations.
•	 Punctual virtual community represents a spontaneous form of unification, alli-
ances or coalition, for a case like political activism, or as an answer to an emer-
gency situation or a catastrophe.
•	 The virtual community is a community on the Internet or on another interactive 
platform of the social Web (SMS or mobile), made of a group of people interact-
ing, sharing and using information in relation with the interests, characteristics 
or professional activities. A virtual community can be used for innovation prod-
ucts or social innovation in a community informatics design setting or in a logic 
of an open innovation community. This type of community does not implicitly 
belong to a formal enterprise network or a business.
•	 The practice community is a concept that EduTechWiki, by referring to the 
Wenger Gervais’s book (2005), defines like a group of people working together 
and that is led to constantly invent local solutions to problems they go through 
in their professional practice. By sharing their knowledge and their expertise, 
these people learn together. This informal collective learning produces social 
practices that reflect the evolution of problem-solving and the interpersonal rela-
tions that follow. These practices also contribute to establish the necessary 
7.13  A DSS Semiformal Typology

252
vocabulary to establish tasks. Furthermore, they make a rather monotonous and 
repetitive work acceptable for participants by developing a pleasant atmosphere 
made of rituals, habits and shared stories. For Dillenbourg et al. (2003, p. 5), 
“a practice community regroups employees of a same organization or several 
organizations who collaborate outside the framework established by their 
organization”.
•	 The innovation community: Von Hippel (2005, 2007) and his collaborator showed 
that very often, the technical innovation takes place in practice communities with 
experienced users. Even if this approach has been productive in the studies on 
innovation in a management perspective, it does not take into account the descrip-
tion of innovations implemented by the non-expert users/designers where the 
community development process is part of the innovation itself and where the 
process is a lot more spontaneous and emerging. Yet, the community informatics 
design project and the APSI My Portal Col@b state another alternative hypoth-
esis. Our case studies which are about Wemotaci (the ACIL collaborative project 
as part of Guy Gendron doctorate studies), community informatics, CCA, 
Unimasoft, Cablexpert, the communication faculty and Botnia show it is not 
relevant to discriminate between the technical innovation and the social innova-
tion in a practice community or the other. Our different case studies show that 
this development in a co-evolutive and generative “socio-technical” hardly 
apprehended by a causal relation and too strictly related to the formal enterprise 
modeling framework. We have discovered that the development of those two 
types of innovation can be better understood as a co-evolutive process where the 
technological infrastructure and the virtual practice community evolve by incor-
porating in their specific environment. This is why, following Van Oost et al. 
(2007), we suggest the innovation community concept as a way to conceptualize 
the type of community informatics innovation implemented from the users’ 
experience where the community’s co-design (collaborative design) becomes an 
integral part of the innovation.
•	 The affinities community is an important DSS archetype where the cohesion 
between actors and agents is motivated by a similar attitude towards certain 
products, services or events. The online consumer associations are typical exam-
ples of these communities that express their beliefs in social networks and act 
retroactively in different ways and via various media, especially by critiquing 
certain products in a blog, by exchanging experiences on the appropriation of 
certain services, by commenting the consumption’s current events in the main 
media relayed by social media. They are the ones we call “prosumers”, and these 
producers-consumers are sometimes very useful for an enterprise that specializes 
in innovation and that must launch new products and services. The experience 
exchange results in collective learning cycles that emerge from the collective 
intelligence and the digital communication.
•	 The interest community (in design) does not directly worry about problem-­
solving or innovation even if in practice, it sometimes does. It unites actors with 
a common interest like the discovery of norms for the DSS development or new 
innovation methods in different fields. The interested community gathers 
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

253
­stakeholders and partners from various horizons and practice communities. 
These participants meet to share information or to discuss certain common inter-
est design problems. The interest community is a community of communities or 
representative of communities. Its members have a common interest in the co-
construction and the global design problem-solving members that are unifying. 
Often temporary, the interest community is created in a specific context or envi-
ronment to dissolve when the project is over. It contains a larger innovation and 
transformation potential than a simple practice community, professions or 
experts institutionally attached, under the condition to exploit the well-known 
“ignorance symmetry” as a social creativity source.
•	 The scientists’ community represents the entire scientific core and researchers of 
all fields, its relations and its interactions, as an answer to the society expecta-
tions towards research centres and universities, namely, the production of reli-
able and viable knowledge. It is normally divided in subcategories of casts, 
schools and chapels more or less open, each one working in a particular field 
within an implacable meritocracy pyramid that reproduces itself in the light of 
mandarinate through symposiums, conferences and other intellectual and com-
petitive private grounds. This functioning and the community in its whole are 
called into questions because of the emergence of social forces and new DSS in 
charge of organizing and distributing the knowledge (e.g. Wikipedia), which 
threatens not only the leadership of intellectuals but also the governance of the 
states that historically used to be in charge of producing and validating new 
knowledge destined to society as a whole and the training of young people. If, 
traditionally, scientific communities were exclusively enough related to a func-
tion an employment status or an institutional affiliation, researchers and profes-
sors of the network society must more and more associate themselves with all 
sorts of partner organizations and institutions organized in collaborative net-
works that generate new DSS like living labs, makers labs and colabs. These 
innovative structures invite researchers to take their expertise outside their labs 
to make it mature, to share it and to jointly validate it in the new fields of research 
of the knowledge economy at the service of sustainable development. The scien-
tific communities go from the knowledge transfer paradigm (knowledge 
transmitter-­receiver model) to the learning communities and community infor-
matics design ones, responsible for a large part of the knowledge production in 
the network society (the dynamic knowledge appropriation and resources mutu-
alization model). A new trust dynamic and open innovation is established and 
progressively replaces the authority, control and authoritarian logic of the her-
metic “private clubs” of the industrial society.
•	 The hypercommunity is a hypermedia community that transcends the traditional 
boundaries of the enterprise, the region and the country. The current increase of 
global issues and borders crises favours the co-creation and management of col-
laborative socio-economic environments where the business world, governments, 
civil society and universities interact locally and globally at various society levels – 
micro, meso and macro – to structure common projects and establish new gover-
nance modes to lead these projects to success while allowing all actors to keep their

identity, their institutional structures and their action properties according to their 
specific skills. However, all community partners recognize the socio-economic 
validation power of the “open complex networks” and the capital gains (social, 
financial, tangible or intangible) they are likely to cause.
By outlining this first semiformal typology of virtual organizations, we are aware 
of not draining the topic and to pose other important research problems, like the 
choice of criteria allowing to execute this typology. However, our ACIL team 
believes that it is the good way to show users, experts or non-experts, the necessity 
to better understand the online social forms in order to develop them in accordance 
with the social needs and, above all, to choose better structuring modeling aspects 
or objects to develop them.
7.14  Community Informatics Design Exostructure
The exogenous elements’ modeling and their interactions with the external DSS 
context seek to identify the DSS interactions with its social, political and economic 
environment. By referring to the works done by ARCON and by relying on the 
works of Camarinha-Matos and Afsarmanesh (2005) and Camarinha-Matos et al. 
(2005a, b, c) and more specifically their book entitled Collaborative Networks: 
Reference Modeling (Camarinha-Matos and Afsarmanesh 2008), we reveal the fol-
lowing modeling subspaces:
	1.	 The market that aims at the design with consumers’/designers’ interaction and 
their competitors
	2.	 The organizational support that refers to the various types of support services 
ranging from the infrastructure design to the institutions likely to support the 
DSS development
	3.	 The societal that aims to model the interactions between the DSS and society in 
general and its various systems, like education, health and justice
	4.	 The organizational elements that deal with potential relations with future mem-
bers, the subgroups and the external group members, in innovative “morphologi-
cal” arrangements or new forms of network organization
7.14.1  The Market Modeling
The vision centred on the market modeling covers an array of problems and issues 
related to the interactions between the communities and the consumers and those of 
the competitors or the potential partner institutions. The interaction of a DSS with 
the vast consumers market may contain elements like electronic transactions and the 
establishment of contracts (e.g. e-commerce), participation agreements or existing 
commitments and the marketing strategy, open externalization or branding. 
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

255
The modeling of the competing elements may contain dimensions like the evalua-
tion of other market strategies, equity or property policies, actors and products posi-
tioning in various markets. The account of these external elements takes us back to 
the intention modeling aspects, the mission and vision of the DSS and its value 
proposal for the socio-economic world.
7.14.2  The Institutional Support Modeling (and Potential 
Partners)
This modeling is related to the definition of various types of services the DSS is 
likely to need and that can be provided by public or private institutions or external 
organizations. Here, we can think about different types of entities like colabs and 
university research institutes, insurance companies, computing or management con-
sultants, financial or logistics services, training institutes, certification organiza-
tions, organizational communication support enterprises and several others. We 
distinguish institutional support modeling that refers to the modeling of necessary 
services for creation and a DSS support and the partnership modeling that aims 
more at the economic collaboration models and strategic innovation partners in a 
particular field. The first one mostly aims the DSS design and the second one, the 
field of social or economic field in which the DSS will evolve.
7.14.3  The Societal Modeling
The societal modeling of a DSS in community informatics design refers to the stra-
tegic of the socio-technical relations structuring in the DSS (like in the virtual com-
munities as community informatics study objects), according to an approach that is 
further, only in part, from the modeling management approaches to enter in a more 
open perspective of the innovation and participative culture. It completes the market 
modeling. Since the management approaches of the business process modeling 
(enterprise architectures) have brought a narrow vision of organizational design, 
community informatics design strategy, inspired by communication and social sci-
ences, had to broaden these economy perspectives towards the non-profit organiza-
tions’  – requesting a “social design” (Morelli)  – to the government services, 
associations and community sector and the universities. We must keep in mind that 
the types of DSS we explained in our semiformal typology (Sect. 7.13) imply a 
comprehension of the field that expands to other forms of DSS, to other forms of 
socio-technical structuring and multiple aspects of information systems program-
ming that are more or less tangible. This more flexible approach towards less 
authoritarian social forms or controls seeks to “put some network in our pyramids”, 
without adopting an absolute approach where we would affirm it, a bit too quickly, 
that in cyberspace, hierarchy and control disappear. This counterproductive 
7.14  Community Informatics Design Exostructure

256
intellectual position is contradicted by our own experiences. The community 
­informatics and the design only seek to enlarge the conceptual framework and the 
information systems discourse by adding social and communication-science con-
cepts to it to lay the theoretical and practical foundations of information systems 
centred on the community and the DSS.
In fact community informatics is an emerging discipline (Stillman et al. 2009) 
that incorporates two orientations. From a socio-technical point of view, it borrows 
from the information sciences and social computing to lead researches on virtual 
communities design as DSS that are socio-technical systems themselves. The sec-
ond orientation is communicational (with socio-political, semiotics, psychosocial 
and anthropological variants); it borrows largely from social sciences to understand 
the societal issues of the DSS implantation and formulate the sustainable develop-
ment intentions that go well beyond the technological and business processes with-
out neglecting them. For example, in addition to the technological and organizational 
architectures, the societal architecture modeling in community informatics design is 
inspired by the paradigms of a discipline we can call “community sociology” (func-
tionalism, evolutionism, conflicts, interactionism; Harvey and Bertrand 2004), in 
order to evaluate their utility and their potential epistemological performance in the 
comprehension of technological uses and the daily relational behaviour of the mem-
bers and communities. The community informatics analysis and diagnostic are 
enriched by the way each of the paradigms defines the community, information, 
communication and technology concepts.
The widened community informatics approach is distinguished from the general 
information systems approach because it enlightens the various ways information 
and social communication which are addressed in social sciences and computing 
while showing the similarities. Thus, for the past 10 years, information systems 
specialized authors such as Hevner et al. (2004), Hirschheim (1985), Hirschheim 
and Klein (1989), Basden (2000, 2002, 2006, 2008, 2010), Whitworth and De Moor 
(2009) and De Moor (2005) have shown the relevance of the Habermas communi-
cational act theory (1984), Giddens’s theory (1984) on structuring social relations, 
Luhmann’s theory (1989, 1995) on the analysis of computing social systems and 
information systems and the philosophy of sciences from Dooyeweerd (1984) to 
establish information systems transdisciplinary bases at the frontiers of interpreta-
tive, sociocritics and positivist approaches. By widening the modeling perspectives, 
an entire research program opens to us in the next few years.
Even if the societal modeling aspect may contain a very wide analysis and 
activity that goes beyond the present connection, the basic idea is to better under-
stand the complex interrelations between a DSS and other social systems, their 
repercussions, their issues and the problematic they raise for the entire society 
(innovation mechanisms, automation, delocalization, sustainable development, 
employment, regional issues, capitals attraction and investments). This perspec-
tive can help us understand the positive or negative elements of the DSS on the 
development of local economies, legal issues, decisional instance attitude, skills to 
validate, the level of education, the conflicts to resolve, the solutions to prioritize 
and the institutional roles to play.

257
7.14.4  The Institutional Modeling: Three, Four or Five 
Helices?
Even if community informatics design is mainly centred on the social systems, it 
does not forget about the entire “business strategies” that inhabits several collabora-
tive network organizations and that is an integral part of the partnership activities. 
Thus, the institutional modeling includes various types of potential, individual, 
institutional, organizational, public or private members. In this spirit and as part of 
our researches on partnership models applicable in the context of the social systems 
construction, we were looking to identify the specific models to optimize the col-
laboration validation effects for the various actors aimed by My Portal Col@b ser-
vices. Let us be reminded that this effort is part of our will to promote the emergence 
of new innovation validation mechanisms within the various actors of the Quebec 
society. Our research task was to explore and redefine a model we have called the 
“quadruple helices” that represents a flexible innovation model and multiparty stra-
tegic alliance as well as a management model aiming to explore the different roles 
of the stakeholders within a given ecosystem (region, local government, various 
organizations).
For 10 years now, several European research groups have been working on a 
triple helix model (Leydesdorff 2002, 2003, 2006) that incorporates the partner-
ships between universities, enterprises and governments. Today, we try to incorpo-
rate a fourth partnership helix to the first three by mobilizing and engaging the civil 
society in the start model, according to the social design philosophy centred on the 
user and, now, on the community. We are even discussing a fifth helix that metapho-
rizes and personifies a fifth innovation actor, the environment (Carayannis and 
Campbell 2011), or more precisely the environment ecology, in the communica-
tional ecology sense suggested by Moles and Rohmer (1986, 1998) almost 40 years 
ago as founding entities of a new collaborative innovation diplomacy and a democ-
ratization of network knowledge. This stakeholders’ pluralism and the diversity of 
the forms they can take, according to the particular intentions of the DSS builders, 
will be the object of our future researches.
For now, we have been looking into the quadruple helix model which focuses on 
the vast cooperation and collaboration projects that represent a progress even an 
intellectual breakthrough towards a systemic innovation policy definition, open 
and centred on the user and the practice community dedicated to innovation. An 
entire development era, linear, oriented from the top to the bottom of organiza-
tions, directed by products and services management experts rationalized in an 
effort and demand logic, gives way to different forms of co-production, co-cre-
ation, co-design with consumers, clients and citizens who progressively become 
users/designers of contents, services and applications. This transformation, high-
lighted in our case studies, our two questionnaires and our European living labs 
observation, is well illustrated in the last CEFRIO studies on social media uses 
(2011). It poses challenges to the university world and to public authorities in 
terms of new digital skills acquisition. In terms of productivity, it opens research 
7.14  Community Informatics Design Exostructure

258
perspectives to explore and also an important debate on the support means for a 
more inclusive growth centred on the ways to ensure a better connection between 
stakeholders and a more intelligent use of resources.
Our current works show that the concept of quadruple helices must not be used 
as a unique entity to be built but rather like a modeling matrix or a collaborative 
continuum capable of helping the decision-making in terms of DSS design and the 
observation of issues related to it: the communicational “holes” in actors’ networks, 
the attractive factors for members or the informational gaps between potential col-
laborators, the ethics and trust issues, the construction of action plans and common 
meanings, membership rules, innovation marketing and sustainable DSS develop-
ment, commitment and participation techniques, as well as the participation of the 
civil society in innovation.
Let us briefly cite four possible forms:
	1.	 The enterprise-university-government model, to which we add the user/citizen 
designers, hence the quadruple helices
	2.	 The colab model centred on the enterprise and the design of strategic alliance 
networks
	3.	 The European living lab model centred on the public sector and the innovation 
research
	4.	 The democratic platform model centred on the citizen
All these forms and several others are emerging in our knowledge economy. The 
analysis of roles, functions, design and management of these models in the socio-­
economic innovated context can offer an entire array of research possibilities as 
winning organizational forms of the future. It could allow to shed light on the vari-
ous government levels that would be very different from one social system form to 
another. According to the sector and production field, the structure of the value 
chain will also be diversified and evolutive. These models can serve as hypotheses 
for the DSS design in a later research.
7.15  The Community Informatics Design Reference Model
In a very simple and succinct manner, we can define the community informatics 
design management (CIDM) as a group of processes and functions associated with 
the organizational strategy and a DSS business model. The CIDM include the con-
tinuous design process and the DSS management, decision-making processes, the 
modeling processes and the implantation strategies that allow to validate innovation 
that these strategies aim the DSS creation, the innovation in terms of products, ser-
vices, digital communications, social platforms and virtual environments or market-
ing and the brand strategy to improve the quality of the socio-economic life and to 
provide concrete tools favouring the success of the DSS and the organizational life 
(virtual and physical).
7  Reference Model, Governance Framework and Instantiation Strategy

259
At a deeper conceptual level, the CIDM seeks to dynamically relate various 
dimensions attached to the life-cycle functionalities, like the DSS management pro-
cesses, the partners, the design, the members, the infrastructures, the equipment and 
the innovation maintenance, by keeping in mind the political and sociocultural con-
texts and the environmental factors. The CIDM is the art and the science of using 
design to improve the collaboration and synergy between users, designers, experts, 
non-initiated, managers, administrators, researchers and citizens in order to opti-
mize the strategy or the business process. The fundamental business processes can 
become central in the case of short- or long-term contracts and unavoidable for the 
DSS design and its competitiveness. Even in social sciences, the management 
dimension becomes a synonym of success and exemplary strategic practices in the 
conduct of projects like the current context of budget restrictions.
The design support process or the background process is strategic or business 
subprocesses that allow to operationalize the DSS in all its life-cycle phases and its 
development. The business process constitution, of a partnership contract or a busi-
ness plan from a collaborative economic model, is an unavoidable activity in situa-
tions where innovation validation is performed by contracts, partnerships, 
collaborative networks and organization alliances. The general process underlying 
by the executed management is an integral part of the DSS community informatics 
design in order to reach a certain rationality in the definition of activities, tasks and 
actions associated to it. The community informatics design management process 
scope may vary and expand from the daily management to the tactical functional-
ities management of an organization’s design, to the strategic activities design and 
collaborative ontological modeling or various processes, including operations, pro-
gramming, human resources and collaboration processes modeling. The CIDM 
joins several types of professions, like multimedia production managers, enterprise 
architects and organizational designers, creation managers, design strategists, inter-
active and participative designers, animators, planners, administrators, marketing 
and branding managers, colab and living lab researchers and any manager making 
decisions regarding the community informatics design functioning modes at various 
cycles of the DSS projects.

An Instantiation Methodology  
and Its Multiple Aspects
It is a common ground to affirm that today, all disciplines are in a crisis. Computer 
and social sciences are no exception. Contrary to what we diffuse in some fields, 
research centres and Quebec universities do not lack ideas, quite to the contrary. We 
experience the ideas inflation (Moles and Rohmer 1986, 1998; Moles 1990; Moles 
and Jacobus 1988), but it is the epistemological mechanisms and practices of ideas 
transition from the lab to the society that are at the heart of the storm. The crisis is 
also linked to the compartmentalization between disciplines, at the origin of the cur-
rent view’s narrowness and the difficulty to create systems that work and contribute 
to the quality of life of all members of society. In our field, community informatics 
design, an international reflection, began 6 or 7  years ago, and the Community 
Informatics journal founded by Michael Gurstein (2003) questions the theoretical 
foundations of information systems design and those of the related disciplines 
(human-computer interfaces, collective teleworking, social computing, socio-­digital 
media, interactive design, emancipated design, human-centred design and, more 
recently, communicational design and community-centred design). This transdisci-
plinary debate is often located at a very abstract level. The present chapter aims to 
fulfill these gaps somehow.
In fact, for the moment, transdisciplinarity does not seem operational in the 
implantation of information and communication systems because we are lacking 
common vocabulary to exchange on our various fields. But there is more. The entire 
problem of field ontology or terminology refers more to a lack in the “sharing of 
meanings” between disciplines that do not communicate, as well as the fact that we 
do not have philosophical foundations to unify these disciplines, which constantly 
expose us to risks of useless verbosity and conflicts related to points of view. Without 
going too far in the epistemology and ontological questions related to our discipline, 
let us simply underline that we must make an effort of openness by observing the 
language of compartmentalized disciplines and explode the various speciality 
boundaries (as a reference to the Henri Laborit’s new chart), to transcend boundar-
ies and linguistics uncertain zones between psychology, with its emphasis on cogni-
tive aspects, sociology for its social aspects, economy for its aspects related to costs 

262
and budgets and studies in operational research on risks or aesthetics for issues 
related to harmony, balance, beauty and systems form. These multiple aspects, like 
we will see further, must be harmonized in the design and implantation of systems 
centred on the human. The contribution of several disciplines is a sine qua non 
condition of the description of fundamental dimensions of social systems and sub-
systems of activities evolving in interaction, through discourses, languages and 
artefacts. We will see a first attempt of this type of effort in the definition of trans-
disciplinary dimensions suggested by community informatics design and in the 
articulation of these dimensions in the form of a “fundamental checklist” that con-
stitutes the heart of our instantiation strategy.
The presentation of the UQAM Colab’s 8C’s approach, the DSS formal typol-
ogy, the metaphor of the partnership strategy quadruple helix, the activity theory 
and its normative transdisciplinary dimensions, the different modeling types of the 
endostructure and the exostructure of collaborative network systems, all that is to 
demonstrate the numerous aspects that concern the social or technological factors 
but also to push our analyses and design parameters further, approaches we need to 
widen while integrating them to the legal, management, biological and formative 
aspects of the community information systems development.
We have no idea regarding the number of aspects we had to take into account for 
modeling, building and commercializing a computer before a consumer could have 
one in front of him. So, we try to imagine the number of disciplines that must 
“exchange their spheres of disciplinary meanings” in order to develop a DSS. The 
worlds to build, the socio-construction (Lemire 2008; Harvey and Lemire (2001)) 
of DSS worlds to analyse, must tend to conciliate multiple meaning spheres to 
instantiate and develop a socio-technical system like a DSS or an innovation com-
munity. The computer expert will see a code to be used and a formal programming 
language to master; the psychologist will examine the interfaces appropriation’s 
psychic aspects; the linguist will work from the information flow, the discourse 
analysis and conversations as well as ontologies management; the semantics Web 
specialist will invest himself in a vocabulary formalization; the sociologist will want 
to get involved in the improvement of the social link through collaboration; the 
manager will seek management methods of roles and resources; the ergonomist will 
manage backaches; and so on.
In the real world, there are no more economic or social problems than “disciplinary 
catastrophes”. The world is not only a disciplinary procedure. Crises are lived in an 
“anthropocentric” and holistic way because they question the being and the com-
munities according to several aspects especially regarding the perception, in addi-
tion to having a physical reality. Despite that, the entire world works in meaning 
spheres, according to various aspects, which generate numerous socio-economic 
repercussions and provoke interference between disciplines, practices, people and 
management modes and between reductionist world visions. However these world 
visions are intrinsically linked to real life problems, like cultural or socio-economic 
conflicts, they have a concrete impact on society, as they have an influence on every 
people’s life. When we add to this the difficulty of current world crises, we can 
understand better why community information systems are so difficult to build and

263
maintain, while at the same time, they represent a formidable simulation tools of 
social processes and an important challenge for the disciplinary evolution of social 
and communicational sciences in the future.
Let us look closely at these fifteen modal aspects without having to develop an 
entire philosophical background to explain them. From Andrew Basden’s works 
(2008, 2010a, b, 2011), the disciple of the philosopher Dooyeweerd (1979, 1984), 
here is how we can divide the various aspects of a DSS, like all the meaning worlds 
that intervene in the design of community informatics systems. We also provide 
some orientations for community informatics design, accompanied by examples:
	 1.	 The quantitative aspect: the analysis of the number of users, attitudes, design 
generations, information system analysis and screen pages to create
	 2.	 The time-related aspect: the analysis of movement in a network, the simultane-
ity or the differentiation of activities, the tasks continuity and the components’ 
parallelism of these tasks in an action plan
	 3.	 The kinematic aspect: the movement and transitions in the building of 3D 
sequences and in the construction of animated images, corporate videos and 
mechanisms related to acts and activities
	 4.	 The physical aspect: the energy, the forces, the mass; closer to us, the material 
resources, work environment, networking, technological infrastructure and col-
laborative platform
	 5.	 The biotic aspect: the vital functions; the human beings; the challenges related 
to the organism; the cognitive and physical ergonomics, illness or malaise 
caused by the computer; and the use of different tools, the environment ecology 
and any other pathology
	 6.	 The psychic aspect: cognition, emotion, users’ psychology, interpersonal sup-
port, video or audio signals that transmit sensations, interactivity and multiple 
intelligences, creativity tools and reflexivity in the action and practices
	 7.	 The analytical aspect: the distinction in the information, the differentiation of 
tasks, the judgment on quality and the information relevance, the press and 
contents analysis tools, the discernment regarding the veracity of information 
sources and the knowledge classification
	 8.	 The formative aspect: continuous learning, schematization, processes control 
and monitoring, power to act, collaborative tools mastery, knowledge of remote 
education mechanisms or the DSS implantation/instantiation and learning 
organizations
	 9.	 The linguistics, semiotic and semantics aspects: the shared symbolic meanings; 
the conversational design; the mediation role and discourse transformation and of 
written and animated languages; the links between activities and disciplinary dis-
courses; the integration of generative ontologies; the establishment of skills termi-
nology; the writing of characteristics by activity field, texts and tables destined to 
the instantiation; the establishment of bridges between practices and disciplines; 
and the lifting of communication obstacles, dispute resolution, comprehension, 
memorizing, social and public communication and collective intelligence
	10.	 The social aspect: social relations, partnerships, roles, functionalities, institutions, 
cooperation, collaboration, communication, connectivity, contract, the acting

264
together and the subsystems of activities that allow it, computer-­mediatized 
social participation and communication and informational mechanisms of 
collaborative design, leadership and communityship, collaborative ontologies 
and social cognition and collaborative intelligence
	11.	 The economic aspect: resources management, budget calculations, manage-
ment sciences, sustainable development, frugality, budgets management and 
the respect of costs and spending, the responsible human development context, 
return on investment (ROI) and social capital
	12.	 The aesthetic aspect: the harmonization of people, policies and values, trust, 
quality interfaces, educational fun social games, design and language games, 
attractive simulations, minimalist design approaches, colour balance, signatures 
and graphic chart
	13.	 The legal aspect: donation, appropriation, people’s rights, the Creative Commons 
licence, intellectual property, contracts negotiation, validation and marketing of 
products and services, social and strategic innovation of products, agreements in 
principle, partnerships conventions and fair sharing of resources
	14.	 The ethical aspect: the citizen science approach, people science, third-phase 
science, donation culture, business deontology, culture of open-source code, 
gift of self, generosity, respect of people, intercultural openness, common 
social values, orientation towards the emancipation of men and women and 
recognizing minorities
	15.	 The vision and hope aspect: the motivating and emancipating orientation, the 
actors’ identity, the evolutive culture, the generative capacity of actions ori-
ented towards the future, the members’ commitment, the recognition of contri-
butions, the lifting of uncertainties, the tolerance towards ambiguity, the 
capacity to settle value conflicts, the unifying optimism and the orientation 
towards change and innovation that requires the mobilizing of energy and 
resources
To conclude this presentation, we would say that DSS design and development can 
be done metaphorically, according to the requirements and required conditions of all 
their aspects like the integration and coordination of the “shared meaning spheres” 
(Sloterdijk 2002, 2005a, b, 2009; Basden 2000, 2002, 2008, 2010a, b) that, within 
collaborative networks with human and non-human components (Latour 2008), will 
create transformational mechanisms that, through conversational design iterative 
spirals (Fuller 1982; Fibonacci 2003), (Bohm 1965, 1996; Banathy 1987, 1992, 1996, 
2000; Banathy and Jenks 1991; Jenlink and Banathy 2008; Luppicini 2008) will cre-
ate DSS projects for the innovation under multiple aspects related to design and the 
community informatics instantiation methodology. We will see that these three power-
ful metaphors (spheres, networks, spirals) will constitute the visual metaphors of My 
Portal Col@b and the SADC, because they, respectively, illustrate the sense (spheres), 
the link (the network) and the dynamic movement (the evolutive spiral) animating 
them on the roads to the evolutive and generative DSS knowledge. They illustrate a 
sort of fundamental core, a creation matrix, a “graphic signature” and a creativity 
chart in community informatics design.
8  An Instantiation Methodology and Its Multiple Aspects

265
8.1  Instantiation Methodology Objectives
The instantiation methodology has the main objective to support the community 
informatics design process by the meticulous deconstruction of its multiple aspects, 
understood as meaning spheres or activities, whether it is management mechanisms, 
design processes, architectures, methodologies or resources that allow to operation-
alize the community informatics reference model in its various virtual and real 
application environments. The development of an instantiation methodology repre-
sents a great challenge for a small research team like the ACIL. This activity, which 
is not present or validated in social sciences, requires the combination of an array of 
models elaborated by a large number of authors in different fields. More specifi-
cally, projects like TOGAF, Ecolead, ARCON, CoSpaces, Botnia and Laboranova 
have inspired us greatly in the creation of this model and doing so under various 
aspects: the definition of partners’ roles, the identification of information sources 
and knowledge, the rights and responsibilities of members, the democratic princi-
ples of development, the governance and management modes and the implantation 
of commitment and innovation strategies. The community informatics reference 
model and the community informatics design (the seven spaces) guide the creation 
and collaboration management process in a DSS to obtain and maintain up to date a 
coherent list of criteria and dimensions, as well as to define, describe, design, 
implant, prototype and operationalize practice communities and innovation strate-
gies in accordance with certain communicational, organizational, social and techno-
logical requirements. We believe that these activities are greatly lacking in the social 
sciences and humanities and most of all in the field of virtual communities that has 
had several empirical studies for several years but that has not consolidated its appli-
cation field theory-wise and the practice phases to reach.
The community informatics instantiation process is a semiformal approach 
(focused on the emergence), both heuristic and systematic, controllable in terms of 
time, money and validation process because it is rigorously defined and able to 
guide the enterprise or the community in the inference of activities’ subsystems 
specific to the reference model or the community informatics’ social architecture at 
three modeling levels: general, sectorial and particular levels. This process will 
allow to establish all the dimensions and conditions required for each modeling 
level: from the general required conditions (theoretical definitions) to the optimiz-
ing and specification of activities subsystems and various sectors or points of view 
(resources, governance, communication, collaboration, coordination, innovation) 
until the particular implantation in a specific field (communication software implan-
tation or decision-making). For the purpose of the present book, the DSS instantia-
tion process refers to the community informatics design process that characterizes 
the creation of the virtual environment (My Portal Col@b and the SADC’s entities and 
components will be presented in detail in the following sections). Community infor-
matics instantiation process describes a series of steps that supports the mecha-
nisms, methodologies and techniques aiming at the generative specification of a 
DSS customizable model, by describing its components for a greater accountability

towards its members and to capacitate them to realize the design of a certain type 
of DSS, of which the components represent the entire particular instance of the 
community informatics reference model.
8.2  The Community Informatics Instantiation Process
Before describing step by step the various instantiation mechanisms, methodologies 
and creativity tools that allow to personalize a life cycle and a particular type of DSS 
according to the needs of its future members, a strategy or a given business model, 
we will first define the generic analysis processes of activities and the basic 
functionalities.
8.3  The Instantiation Methodology and the Conceptual 
Framework Context
Community informatics design is a communicational activity by nature; it depends on 
the discourse as a semiotic mediation tool within cognitive, collaborative, cultural and 
creative activities that are essential to master the socio-economical and historical pat-
terns that are an integral part of the society’s structuring (Giddens 1984; Jenlink 2001). 
We will use the activity theory (Kant; Hegel 2006; Marx; Vygotsky 1978; Leont’ev; 
Luria; Cole; Engeström 1987, 1999; Jenlink 2009; Jenlink and Banathy 2002, 2008; 
Trestini and Lemire 2009) as a basic conceptual framework to understand the impor-
tance of the conversation’s mediation role (and the conversational design) in the com-
munity informatics design, as a sociocultural perspective and a design perspective 
oriented towards research and enlightening the community informatics design rela-
tion, as a human activity system, as defined by Peter Checkland (Checkland and 
Holwell 1998), as well as the more general sociocultural context in which design 
activities take place. From Checkland and Scholes’s works (1990), community 
informatics design can be understood as a type of human activity system, naturally 
intentional, which can serve to create new systems like DSS that do not exist in the 
real world (e.g. the SADC or any business design platform).
8.3.1  The Activity Theory
In the activity theory reference framework, the community informatics designers 
(the community informatics experts) and the participants of the DSS co-creation are 
guided by objects (what Pelle Ehn and his followers call the Internet of Things) or 
by expectations founded on their motivation to create an ideal DSS or more favour-
able to citizens, by addressing multiple aspects of information systems design, that 
8  An Instantiation Methodology and Its Multiple Aspects

267
go further than the traditional systems design perspectives (Basden 2010a, b). The 
collective creation activity is mediatized by the use of cultural artefacts that can be 
understood as a combination of series of rules, procedures, roles, symbols, manage-
ment modes, cognitive appropriation activities, communication and language, col-
laboration patterns, structures and social and organizational processes, creativity 
tools and collaborative design platforms like a SADC. Among the important per-
spectives in the use of community informatics as a DSS design technology, let us 
mention the language systems (natural, computing, management, communication) 
and conversational design. We also consider like critical factors of the design orien-
tation process, the set of sociocultural rules, to harmonize with the objects, mem-
bers’ motivations, their expectations, communicational requirements and the 
different aspects of the socio-technical design context (see the aspect theory of 
Andrew Basden 2010a, b). We also consider essential the entire management aspect 
of members in a partnership for social innovation and the entire context of stake-
holders commitment that seek to realize the design of an ideal DSS, for example, in 
education, health or business, thus creating a designer’s community. The commu-
nity group composition balance between internal members and the partners is real-
ized by a facilitator or administrator who designs the division and coordination of 
the work by favouring an authentic commitment of all participants in the change 
process. At the centre of all essential perspectives of this reference framework is the 
ethics perspective, the values and beliefs adopted by the participants that give a 
coherent social logic to the design community.
The activity theory is an essential reference framework to understand the differ-
ent spheres of meanings of a human activity system like the DSS. It rests on the 
“relational socio-dynamic” between the subject (cognition and social appropriation 
of technologies), the object, the mediation artefacts (collaborative tools, social 
media and creativity tools), sociocultural tools, the work division and the designers’ 
community structure as a human activity system dedicated to the DSS construction. 
The designers’ community gathers people that share the same object, the co-­creation 
of an ideal system. The rules refer to the explicit norms, the values, the criteria 
and the conventions that constrain the actions. As for the work division of action 
oriented towards objects and design aspects, it aims at the roles determination and 
the coordination of collaborative work flow.
As a sociocultural theory of human activity and learning, the activity theory focuses 
its attention on the interaction within the DSS and between people as the first source 
of communicational action, an interaction that will result in the objectification of the 
human subjectivity through social action. As we mentioned in the presentation of the 
seven design spaces (Sect. 6.5), community informatics design is based on the point 
of view of a “social action” concept for the identification and the intentional organiza-
tion of detailed activities of collaborative design in all the phases of its instantiation 
and life cycle. The human activity systems are complex actions, activities and 
practices and interdependent design systems located in a historical, sociocultural, 
political and economic context (see the digital literacy triangle, Fig. 7.5).
The top triangle (C) represents an element of the activity system that helps define 
the relations between the subject, the object and the mediation artefacts. The subject 
8.3  The Instantiation Methodology and the Conceptual Framework Context

268
of any activity is the people for whom the design activity is initiated. The object is 
the reason, the intention or the implicit or explicit result of the activity. The mediation 
artefacts, the tools and the media are both of cultural and technological origin and 
serve as “mediators” between the actions and subjects and the activities by which the 
object is transformed or is the object of a new design throughout the objectification 
process and, on the other hand, the human subjectivity (computing social or formal 
languages, various forms of political or socio-economic organizations, cultural or 
ethical norms, ideals supported by DSS projects).
The second triangle (A), at the bottom left, represents one of the interdependent 
elements of the activity system. This element and entities they contain describe the 
relations between the subjects and the sociocultural rules of the design community 
(related with the object, the objectives and the results) the community makes 
explicit, even formal.
The third triangle (B), at the bottom right, represents the relations between the 
objects or the intentional results, the community or the DSS in which the subject is 
a member of, as well as the work and tasks repartition to realize in a particular activ-
ity, in this case, the design activities for the subsystems creation. The work division 
should be designed in terms of description and differentiation of members or part-
ners roles, as well as in terms of coordination and task management within the com-
munity informatics experts’ community and, then, in the emerging DSS.  The 
community informatics culture produces the DSS prototype, configures it, adapts it 
and transforms it as the individuals and the users/designers attend their various 
activities.
Connected and interdependent, the three sub-triangles (A, B and C as actions 
subsystems) make a reference framework for the analysis and design of a human 
activity system like a DSS or a community informatics designers’ community. With 
this reference framework and the help of the seven design spaces life cycle, we will 
elaborate a community informatics design instantiation methodology as a complex 
activity subsystem and the relations that validate community informatics designers 
in the completion of their tasks.
In fact, the activity theory states that an activity, like community informatics 
design, conversational design and social change, is a social unit that involves a 
socially defined goal and the execution of specific social actions that have evolved 
in time and resulted in the achievement of this goal: a DSS co-creation. The activi-
ties contain cognition, communication, coordination, negotiation and creation pat-
terns that interact with other patterns associated with the start of the DSS or the 
definition of roles, which implies the community informatics designer masters a 
series of creativity and collaboration tools like the symbolic ones (programming 
languages) to discourse tools (like communicational action, socially responsible 
communicational design, conversational design) and to process tools (like members 
management, collaborative project and community informatics design manage-
ment) or a series of social media and complex collaborative platforms as illustrated 
in the Brian Solis (2010) conversation prism, which illustrates the use contexts of 
social media and its related activities. Let us note that, since the creation of its first 
prism in 2008, in 2013, Solis notices the extent of the conversational social media 
explosion that took place in 5 years (Fig. 8.1).
8  An Instantiation Methodology and Its Multiple Aspects

269
The activity theory, applied to social media uses in the Solis prism, shows us that 
the social participation of people in conversational design activities is similar from 
one system to another. The ACIL team’s point of view is that computer-mediatized 
social participation and collaboration contain fundamental activity patterns regard-
less of the tools used by the activity system to be developed. Whether it is analysing 
the world to inject some sense or to print new meanings with the help of various 
design types, we find the same fundamental simple forms. Even if each field or 
specific tool use contains its priorities, its components and unique mechanisms, 
fundamental activities come back in each field or DSS type.
Instead of different fundamental behaviours, we foresee differences in the context 
characteristics. Each context or field of application of a tool like Wikipedia or 
Facebook can produce its own research or conferences trend. Also, we could reform 
the Solis prism’s petals with more theoretical fields, like the ones from our semi-­
typology (Chap. 6), and introduce activities contexts like education, health or busi-
ness, collaborative network organizations, communities or synchronous or 
asynchronous learning networks, virtual communities, virtual organizations, social 
media, virtual teams, computer-mediatized communication, compute-mediatized 
social participation, human-computer interfaces, DSS design, etc. In all these contexts, 
the conversation is not just a metaphor for design: it constitutes a fundamental activity. 
Participation, commitment, management, negotiation and collaboration take root in 
the conversation.

8.3.2  Conversational Design
Thus, conversation, in the DSS design context, is not just verbiage or a vague dialogue 
on not well-defined issues; it is instead largely considered like a communicational 
action, a real media through which participants contribute to the generation of con-
tents and the infrastructure design by committing to a transdisciplinary research 
leading to the creation of a new DSS in its multiple aspects and objects. Conversational 
design is not just a particular type of discourse, it is a dynamic system in interaction 
with other discourse systems (management, collaboration, negotiation), each with 
its objectives and its intentions and channels a specific mediation importance as a 
semiotic tool in community informatics design activities.
When we analyse it through the activity theory prism (Fig. 7.3), communicational 
action, practice discourse and orientations founded on research of various aspects of a 
social system, conversational design raises an important and deep system of social 
actions based on rules and communication mechanisms of various types, at several 
levels. These actions are mediated, mediatized and ruled by social languages and 
disciplinary discourses that are politically and culturally tainted by their context of 
origin. The complexity of community informatics design, as reflected in the seven 
design spaces, requires a wide array of fields and disciplines, reinforces our argu-
mentation according to which we need various forms of discourse to realize all the 
stakeholders input as they get invested in the design process.
Community informatics design represents a series of communication and social 
actions that take place within a more general design activity dynamic (the exostruc-
ture). The community informatics design global activity system can be represented 
as a set of events, situations, project management activities, collaborative commu-
nication activities, processes, functionalities and interdependent socio-digital 
media. We will see in Chap. 6, a series of tables that follow the rhythm of the instan-
tiation phases of the community informatics life cycle, that deconstruct each DSS 
functionality activity to transform each object or aspect into an operational and 
explicit intention. By doing so, we execute three tasks:
	1.	 We transform a fundamental list of aspects, dimensions and parameters to 
explore into a series of intentional actions directed towards a goal.
	2.	 We analyse languages and discourse of different fields (e.g. management, social 
and computing sciences) to use in order to make the design of an ideal DSS or a 
desired strategy.
	3.	 We outline and create the DSS “enriched image” that would have the intention of 
improving social justice, equity, cultural differences, the conscience level read-
ing various issues or even to create a socio-economic innovation strategy or a 
more ethical business model.
Without an in-depth exploration of the role of conversational design in community 
informatics design, we will say it constitutes a meta-conversation that incorporates 
each form of discourse, ethics or computer related, which contains each of the discourse 
forms associated with design activities: the natural language discourse, the strategic 
8  An Instantiation Methodology and Its Multiple Aspects

271
and generative discourse, the conversation in social media, the creativity tools that 
generate contents, the semiformal discourse of media design and collaborative 
co-design platforms and the programming languages formal discourse. The key to 
this conversational meta-design resides in the fact that we must train students and 
future professionals with the necessary skill to realize the effective transition 
between the discourse forms and use each discourse form in a relevant way at all 
stages of the design activity and life cycle. Like Gilles Lemire (2008) reminds us, as 
a programming tool, configuration tools, exchange and disciplinary sharing (at the 
same level as tools and social media), conversational design “instrumentalizes” the 
user, the student and the expert involved in the design activities.
8.3.2.1  Conversational Design as a Community Informatics Design 
Activity
In this context, members, users/designers and the stakeholders have two functions: 
they realize the ideal community informatics system’s design and then the design 
and modeling of their own design process, and they redo the structure, processes 
and the essential social media design that are fundamental to their concrete com-
munity informatics design activities. In this sense, conversational design fulfills a 
mediation function that serves to mediate the activities of the community informat-
ics system’s global seven spaces of design. It constitutes in fact the meta-discourse 
and meta-design through which the community informatics DSS system design is 
created. In other words, there are two design strategies: the DSS scenario and the 
design strategy scenario specific to each DSS, according to the required conditions, 
the needs and the type of DSS to build.
Just like in the ideal concept of “social system design” put forward by Bela 
Banathy (1987, 1992, 1996, 2000; Banathy and Jenlink 2005), which is a central 
source of inspiration for the DSS community informatics design, the activity theory 
recognizes the importance of the mediation role of the conversation in the analysis 
and the multi-aspect design of these systems. Also, language is a mediation tool 
between the community informatics design and the activity theory. By pushing even 
further, several great theoreticians (Bausch and Flanagan 2013; Bausch 2000, 2001; 
Jones 2008, 2010; Jones et al. 2007; Christakis and Bausch 2006; Warfield 1976, 
1990, 1999; Pask 1975a, b, 1976) have recognized the importance of the dialogue 
and the conversation in the DSS design thanks to the conversational power of the 
socio-digital media. We can consider that contrary to the mass communication 
media, social or socio-digital media, through the great interactivity and intercon-
nectivity capacity they allow (blogs, chat rooms, online forums, videoconference, 
creativity, machine learning tools, cyber-physical system tools and design assis-
tance tools), represent several modalities of the social conversation that is necessary 
to properly understand the mediation role in the future DSS in order to improve our 
skills in their design. But that is not all. The conversation instantiation incorporates 
socio-digital media like an operationalization chart of the exchange and collaboration 
between active participants in the DSS creation.
8.3  The Instantiation Methodology and the Conceptual Framework Context

272
Indeed, when we observe and analyse conversational design nor only in its 
mediation role but also as an activity, the researcher’s attention goes from the socio-­
digital media mediation role to the transformation role, in the reference framework 
of the activity theory. As an activity system (or subsystem), conversational design 
focuses its attention on the object and the activity aspects within the global activity 
system design represented by the seven spaces. More precisely, if we consider that 
the human activity system (e.g. a portal like the Colab, dedicated to the design of 
DSS) is a set of interdependent activities, the design of a community informatics 
system must consider the object or the particular aspects of each design activity. 
The discourse form, the social or technical language, formal or semiformal, the type 
of socio-digital media and the communicational platform collaborative design 
network are semiotic tools that “mediatize” or mediate the stakeholders and users/
designers social actions.
These semiotic forms of technical and social discourse are largely determined by 
the inherent objects and aspects of each of the activity subspaces instantiated in the 
instantiation methodology analysis chart we will present in the next section: at each 
activity subspace in all the life-cycle phases, ethics rules, sociocultural norms, a 
social or community structure and a work distribution/coordination specific to a 
field which influence the design activities. The seven spaces “instantiation field” is 
a complex attractor of discursive activities, a conversational field that constitutes a 
matrix for the community informatics design conversation. In fact, each discourse 
form or each allowed discourse modality contains a certain number of technical and 
sociocultural rules, its ontology and specific terminology, its interaction and coop-
eration patterns and specific collaborative social actions so that each design field has 
its unique discourse, like the present book, for better or for worse.
Each conversation field of each sub-field of activity contributes to the evolution 
of the matrices that supports the conversational design and the community informat-
ics design in all its entities, elements and world aspects to be instantiated (manage-
ment, collaboration, rules). Let us note that for our students, each field of activities 
and each discourse field associated to it represent a series of functions and function-
alities relatively well observable and classifiable. In fact, within the reference 
framework of the activity theory, the conversational field is generated in and through 
the relations between the subject, the mediational field and the language, as well as 
through the object and its aspects. The influence of socio-technical and sociocul-
tural rules can allow to observe the object transformations (a DSS) and its diverse 
aspects on the design activity through the mediation discourse, that in return, helps 
to structure the social or organizational transformation processes.
One of the most important points to remember is that the type of discourse and 
hyper media language (“audioscriptovisual”, 3D animation, schematization, process 
visualization) used as a modeling semiotic tool influences the object transformation 
in all its aspects (the DSS and its various cognitive, social, technological, functional 
or aesthetic aspects) into a community informatics design system dedicated to the 
co-creation of the ideal DSS. Once again, the double function of conversational 
design, as a mediation tool and an activity allowing the instantiation of concrete design 
activities’ subsystems, refers to the double user/designer role of the stakeholders, 
8  An Instantiation Methodology and Its Multiple Aspects

273
a critical role for the understanding of conversational design as an inherent and 
essential activity system in community informatics design.
The attentive reader will understand that as an activity system, conversational 
design requires the differentiation of roles, functions and work values, and the coop-
eration of many proactive partners and futures DSS members’ in the planning and 
coordination of a series of design activities mediatized by discourses and social 
media (see Fig. 7.1). The participation of all stakeholders (experts and non-initi-
ated) as users/designers represents a fundamental characteristic of the conversa-
tional field construction and the instantiation methodology of the definition matrix 
of activities at each phase of the seven design spaces’ life cycle. It is a fundamental 
characteristic of meta-design, which, by searching to define the forms and the dif-
ferent semiotic registers of the discourse in all activities subsystems sections, seeks 
to update and operationalize community informatics design in its various aspects.
As we will concretely see below, the conversational patterns are built by the 
instantiation of activities and activities subsystems specific to the design of a particu-
lar DSS type. Conversational patterns and evolutive and generative ontologies are 
built through the different design activities we will examine in the following section. 
In return, the energy and dynamic of exchanges resulting from the identification of 
the various forms of discourse and modeling languages make the language patterns 
evolve and generate a potential for creativity and transformation at a superior level. 
It is one of the fundamental inputs of our research, because even if the language 
identification is never an enclosed or premeditated exercise, it is important to define 
the disciplinary terms partially unified to facilitate the collaboration between people 
and communities of all horizons.
8.3.2.2  The Community Informatics Design Fundamental Processes: 
Verbs and Instantiation Activities
In this section, we will define with verbs and design activity expressions a series of 
operations to realize that we will find in the community informatics design instan-
tiation methodology charts (In Chap. 6).
Manage the members and the management structure  Set of activities and support 
tools allowing the members integration, their accreditation, their banishment, their 
recruitment and the categorization of their status within a DSS. This operation is 
spread into mechanisms dedicated to the members’ registration, the roles assignment 
and the work and responsibilities distribution.
Manage digital skills  Set of activities and tools helping the design and creation of 
digital and collective skill profiles (Le Boterf and the Canadian Alliance) of the DSS 
members, to identify the DSS digital skills, what we call, with Van Osch and Avital 
(2010b), the “collective generative capacity”. It is the generic capacity of a DSS or 
a virtual community to collectively commit to the production of new socio-technical 
configurations and new creation possibilities as well as to the conceptual framework 
change, in order to defy the static character of certain organizations in the context of 
8.3  The Instantiation Methodology and the Conceptual Framework Context

274
intentional communication action. This operation also contains the capacity to train 
members and to evaluate their collaborative skills and those of new members, as 
well as the discovery of new digital skills to be acquired in order to improve the 
DSS competitiveness structure (Harvey 2011) in a multitude of innovation fields 
and communication and disciplinary contexts.
Identify the collaboration possibilities  Set of activities and tools helping to discover 
new collaboration possibilities and that could trigger the formation of a new virtual 
organization or DSS. The potential collaboration avenues on the dynamic between 
individual and collective DSS skills and the ones of potential external members in 
a particular field. The collaboration perspectives can come from the inside or the 
outside, locally or internationally. They concern a member, a community or an 
organization and can be discovered by a mediator or an organization dedicated to 
employment.
Characterize the collaboration possibilities and plan “as the crow flies”  Set of 
support activities and tools allowing to determine and define individual and collec-
tive skills, practical abilities, capacities and aptitudes required to answer a promis-
ing collaboration opportunity as well as to schematize the approximate DSS 
structure from a first description of skills, at each feedback cycle of the life cycle 
including the desired organizational form and the partners’ roles. At this stage, it is 
important to examine the respective DSS partners’ skills according to the DSS type 
targeted by the co-design and the type of partnership we wish to update with con-
tracts or cooperation agreements.
Choose partners and create partnerships  Set of communicational and informational 
activities and series of socio-digital media promoting the scouting of partners and 
negotiation, their rigorous evaluation and selection by matching their skills with the 
required skills to meet the requirements of collaboration opportunities and face the 
innovation challenges associated to them. Among the relevant dimensions, let us men-
tion the generic digital skills, the economic stability, the financial situation, the prefer-
ences, the reliability indicators, notoriety and the expertise acknowledgement.
Create partnership contracts and negotiate  Set of management activities and sup-
port tools that assist people, community members and partners throughout the vari-
ous iterative discussion and conversation phases with the objective of matching the 
needs and skills of various actors seeking to create a DSS. Community informatics 
design management includes agreement form design and relational and administra-
tive contracts as well as workshops and contracts techniques. Important issues to 
address in this process are the following: determination of the entities and the 
program aspects to negotiate, the protocol or negotiation democratic mechanisms, 
decision process and the dimensions that correspond to it, availability of collabora-
tive tools and socio-digital media, the sharing of resources, the use of licences, 
the agreement representation and their potential diffusion in the media and on the 
Internet. In a DSS co-design setting, the contractual process involves a great nego-
tiation that goes beyond the parameters related to technology or objects. Other 
dimensions must be taken into account, especially the relational contract, the ethics 
8  An Instantiation Methodology and Its Multiple Aspects

275
contract and the social contract. All these aspects must be considered before starting 
the works and launch of the DSS.
Manage DSS knowledge and manage contents  Set of activities relative to the appro-
priation, process, production, diffusion and sharing of the information and knowledge 
within the DSS community and in the extended DSS and the partners. These tasks aim 
at the necessary elements for the DSS construction as well as the introduction of new 
members or partners, the update of the digital library and heritage conservation, 
archives and hypermedia and audioscriptovisual productions. These activities seek 
to support the works and development projects of the DSS at all life-cycle phases, 
to conserve and share the use cases, the research results, the best practices, the 
collaborative ontologies by fields and the lessons learned from the design of virtual 
organizations and previous DSS.
Establish trust  Set of design activities and tools that are useful for the evaluation of 
the basic trust we can give to new members (like credibility, authority, financial 
stability), as well as the evaluation and the subsequent monitoring, throughout the 
collaboration processes commanded by collaborative projects.
Evaluate collaboration (performance)  Set of evaluation activities and monitoring 
and analysis tools that allow to start a DSS, to follow its evolution, to qualify it and to 
adjust its collaborative mechanisms by using dimensions and performance indicators. 
A social and collaborative dashboard can be a visual support for this activity.
Making decisions  Set of management activities and software tools that contribute 
to support the monitoring activities of performance indicators and the visualization 
of DSS activities (dashboards). These tasks can be separated in various mechanisms 
like conflict management, levels of skills, communication obstacles, alerts, perfor-
mance declines and trust issues at various levels.
8.3.2.3  Subsystems of Activities and Process
Define strategic communication and the marketing plan  Set of design and management 
activities and tools that support the formulation of a strategic plan and the planning 
of co-creation activities (including the marketing process and branding strategies), 
in order to promote the generative capacity of the DSS as well as the skills and 
abilities of its current and potential members and consumers interested by its services 
or applications.
Make a budget and assign resources  Set of management activities, accounting 
tools, responsibilities structures and accountability procedures that guarantee the 
DSS financial health by specifying the admissible sending or not and ensuring an 
efficient, effective and fair resources distribution.
Structure the governance  Set of design activities and support tools related to the 
global management policy of the future DSS, including internal and external opera-
tional rules, regulations, procedure and the norms supporting the daily operations of 
8.3  The Instantiation Methodology and the Conceptual Framework Context

276
the network structure and the social processes of the DSS: members and partners, 
positions, roles, status, rights and responsibilities, ethic rules and their applications 
as well as relations between all these parameters.
Capitalize (memorize and appropriation)  Set of design activities and appropriation 
and memorizing tools that seek to transform DSS activities into human, organiza-
tional, social and financial capital by accumulation: hypermedia documents and 
video to share, efficient methodologies on the epistemological and practical plans, 
collaborative tools and social media to share, lessons learned and exemplary prac-
tices, useful and efficient governance policies and network support contacts for the 
development of the DSS. These activities are divided into specific mechanisms of 
access rights (the public, targeted public, micro-markets, specific virtual communi-
ties, private access, limited use) for all the DSS members and partners and diffusion 
policies for announcements and events.
Realize the design and act in the respect of ethics  Set of design activities and tools 
that guide change and innovation according to the future desired orientations and 
common values of the DSS members and partners. This set contains support func-
tionalities of tangible and intangible, material and non-material values of the DSS 
community that organize the general and specific expectations and requirements of 
the members and partners. The general DSS co-creation activity through commu-
nity informatics design relies on the self-organization and shared expectations ideas, 
as well as on the taking over of all activities regarding the DSS to be developed.
Ontologize  Set of conversational design activities (semantic and semiotic) and 
software tools that support the ontological adaptation of the community informatics 
design and the DSS in a socio-economic field or a specific innovation sector. These 
activities also accompany the evolution of the DSS through the community infor-
matics design catalysed in the seven spaces methodology of its life cycle. They 
contain the definition of glossary terms or a terminology specific to a field of activi-
ties or practices that constitutes the reference or instantiation architecture of the 
DSS. This vocabulary and these definitions also support the training, the learning 
and the skills acquisition process in the creation and organization of contents. They 
also support the global generative capacity of the DSS and members’ social creativ-
ity processes. On the Internet, the words of the DSS community become the com-
munity itself.
Configure and manage information and communication technologies  Set of design 
and management activities in community informatics that seeks to define the func-
tions and functionalities required by a DSS that later translate into support tools. 
These various collaborative tools, for example digital media, design tools, open-
source design platform and creativity free software, which are easily configurable, 
should facilitate online sociability and be inter-operational in the ICT infrastructure 
of each of the distributed partners. They aim to allow the different DSS users and 
partners to perform the design of various applications and tools obtained in the 
cloud in order to exchange and share the resources and the capitals of any nature 
(human, social, technological, financial) in a transparent and continuous way in 
order to collaborate to the design of innovation solutions on the Internet.
8  An Instantiation Methodology and Its Multiple Aspects

277
Identify supporting institutions  Set of design and management activities and a series 
of Web design tools and methodologies allowing to identify, incorporate and facili-
tate supporting institutions for the DSS development. Without being socio-­economic 
partners dedicated to the innovation, these contributors provide the necessary 
services for the DSS development and its activities. The information related to the 
supporting institutions selection and the justification of choices (tenders, Web 
approaches, selection criteria) are entered in the digital library through management 
software and recording mechanisms similar to the members registration.
Design and manage the innovation process  Set of activities and tools that allows 
the new DSS to model and manage mechanisms and innovation forms in various 
activities sectors:
	1.	 The identification of possibilities and development perspectives
	2.	 The imagination of new worlds and ways to access them
	3.	 The proposition of new rules and strategies that could produce new results
	4.	 The construction of new teams and organizations of the new knowledge econ-
omy, like the innovation communities and DSS
	5.	 The adoption of new practices and the appropriation of new tools like commu-
nity informatics design

Chapter 9
Toward a Discovery and Strategic Alignment 
Matrices for Socio-technical Systems’ Design
Towards A Multi-aspect and Multi-field Modeling 
Architecture and Complex Social Systems and Virtual 
Communities’ Design
In the introduction of the present book, we have underlined the fact that the socio-­
technical systems’ complexity and extent are experiencing an exponential growth in 
the strong progression of global markets, technological capacities, social media 
platforms, consumers’ and users’ expectations and social needs. All these factors 
contribute to the complication of websites, portals, collaborative networks and vir-
tual practice communities’ co-design dedicated to human development that expands 
beyond the formal paradigm of traditional engineering systems. These challenges 
force software engineers, technology managers and the all ICT users/designers to 
consider technological platforms, social media and collaborative technologies like 
broader systems components containing not only technical aspects but also social 
and human aspects. The current conceptual models, coming from software engineer 
systems and the social science field (human-computer interaction, computer-­
mediatized collaborative work, Scandinavian participative design, interactive 
design, digital design), are limited in their perspectives, more specifically in their 
aptitude to represent the information and complex virtual systems’ architectures. 
This chapter presents a conceptual structure and a modeling framework seeking to 
improve the existing socio-technical systems’ design architectures. Returning to the 
notion of social architecture, we suggest an analysis and design framework that 
allows to jointly optimize, operationalize and instantiate architectures defined in the 
previous chapters (technological, organizational and informational, participative 
and collaborative architectures) for the DSS design as ICT-mediatized human activ-
ity systems (social media, collaborative platform creativity tools).
The value of our theoretical and practical effort will be to allow computational 
social science and digital communication practitioners to have, for the first time, 
tools and means to design and visually arrange the social informational and collab-
orative structure of their online activity systems while allowing engineers, managers 
and computer programmers to ignore the frontiers of their specialties in order to 
structure various types of discourses, conversations and languages to facilitate 
socio-technical systems design like the DSS.  This chapter represents a way to 
increase the existing documentation by suggesting a clear generic structure for the 

280
construction of human activity systems on the Internet, such as DSS in health, learn-
ing communities in education, virtual campuses and universities, social networks 
and virtual communities and cultural intervention and strategies. It does not require 
a special computer programming or formal language coding expertise. Based on the 
discovery matrix, the technique of morphology analysis, heuristic questioning 
matrices in the creative and imaginative thinking (Moles and Rohmer 1986, 1998; 
Moles 1990; Moles and Jacobus 1988) as well as on the multi-field and multi-aspect 
matrices (Basden 2011), our approach seeks to provide social science researchers 
with a qualitative and methodology that could be used by communication students 
and citizens/designers to identify, name and organize community information sys-
tems to better capture, memorize, treat, analyse and design complex data related to 
community informatics systems that will have a stronger ethical and socio-­
communicational character in a near future.
Community informatics design is a field of investigation that seeks practical 
solutions to important multi-aspect socio-technical problems. Its emergence 
throughout the past 20 years was answering a growing complexity of ICT uses, the 
insufficiencies of existing conceptual frameworks as well as gaps in the comprehen-
sion of theories and practices that guide communication and social science research-
ers, the policymakers, the non-expert systems design professionals, technology 
managers and software engineers who face important disciplinary integration chal-
lenges, like design and management of large-scale complex systems. Community 
informatics design can especially find an interest in the following activities:
•	 The co-creation of socio-technical systems like virtual communities
•	 The definition of government technological policies, enterprise business strate-
gies research, platforms and grant policies
•	 The integration of human and social factors in the management of engineering 
projects, open innovation, social entrepreneurship and democratic community-
ship in design thinking and citizen science
•	 Participative research action and participative in health, education and sustain-
able development
•	 The orientation of marketing and public communication strategies for commu-
nity managers
•	 The analysis of stakeholder networks in the collective decision-making
•	 The development of products and services from social science theories and new 
communicational models to orient society’s large-scale socio-technical project
9.1  The Industrial Design, the Collaborative Network 
Architecture and Organizational Modeling
The problems community informatics design seeks to fix are not new at all. They are 
not a discipline’s prerogative since several fields of research are developed around 
tools and methods related to social appropriation of technologies, socio-technical

281
intervention, participative design and interactive design. However, except for a few 
defined research fields like engineering, technology management, social computing 
and community informatics, few fields have adopted an extended perspective to 
explain and develop, in a transdisciplinary vision, systems that incorporate behav-
iours, organizational structures, social and human aspects, life sciences, manage-
ment and socio-technical systems. Community informatics design seeks to 
incorporate these various disciplines in order to discover the principles, properties 
and fundamental processes of various technical and social systems that accomplish 
important functions in our societies. These social systems are human activity sys-
tems, as defined by Peter Checkland (1981), systems that are very different from 
purely physical systems like biologists or engineers design them. They embrace 
multiple aspects (particularly technologies, ethics, aesthetics, education and social 
interactions) of large-scale complex systems (Basden 2010a, b), for example, manu-
facturing systems, education practice communities, health services design, public 
communication policies and the development of platforms and democratic 
ecosystems.
In the previous chapters, we have presented several research sectors for the co-­
design of large-scale complex systems like socio-collaborative network and educa-
tion practice communities, sustainable development studies, social change or human 
development. These perspectives contain the following elements:
•	 The optimal design of general and specific objectives for such systems
•	 Hard but mostly soft approaches for the social, organizational and technological 
architectures modeling of such systems (Chap. 6) by non-initiated managers, 
researchers and students in social sciences and in communications. 
Transdisciplinary approaches (Nicolescu 1996, 2010) allowing to represent and 
model the architectures and the social subsystems associated with these 
objectives
•	 Methods and tools allowing to model and understand the behaviours of use and 
design (conversational design, the activity theory, the DSS typology, the com-
munity informatics design exploratory space, the social media alignment matrix)
•	 Technical and practical means of prototyping, evaluating and testing models, 
development scenarios and new real digital social systems
•	 Approaches, methods and collaborative and social media that could help the 
decision-making, visualization of information and interactive social processes, 
an evaluation questionnaire of uses and the culture of design in virtual communi-
ties, exemplary case studies, websites analysis and a flexible and emerging life 
cycle that could support the DSS, instantiate them, operate them and ensure their 
monitoring and use them
In order to bring forward knowledge and the mastery of concepts and practices 
in these fundamental fields of research, university researchers in social and com-
munication sciences must discover and suggest a philosophical examination related 
to these systems, like ontology (the study of the nature of these systems), episte-
mology (the study of ways to study these systems and to learn though them) and 
9.1  The Industrial Design, the Collaborative Network Architecture…

methodologies appropriate to their design and applications. This reminds us a few 
fundamental research questions:
•	 How can we define community informatics design and the digital social 
systems?
•	 What information or data do we need to describe and analyse digital social 
systems?
•	 Where can we find the relevant information?
•	 How can we observe the DSS?
•	 Do we have the conceptual and practical tools to develop the theories on DSS 
and their community informatics design?
•	 What are the ontological, epistemological, theoretical and practical challenges 
associated with the integration of social sciences, semiotic theories in communi-
cation, management, design thinking and communicational engineering?
In this chapter, we will examine these questions by going back briefly on the his-
tory of systematic thinking and design to note the current gaps of online social 
systems co-design like virtual community systems (human activity system includ-
ing multiple socio-technical aspects) that, beyond technology and media, are pre-
sented like community or social information systems. Then, we will present an 
ontological community information system model likely to help the DSS construc-
tion. By using this conceptual structure, we will present a conceptual framework for 
the modeling and design of these systems based on the CAPACITÉS socio-­technical 
model (Chap. 4) and called “discovery and strategic alignment matrices for the DSS 
community informatics design”. In other aspects, we will examine the required 
information to describe a DSS, the location where the information is memorized, a 
technique that allows to find this information and instantiation methods of this 
information in the community informatics design.
This chapter will also provide community information systems practitioners with 
various means to improve the knowledge basis to facilitate community informatics 
design of human activity socio-technical systems like the co-design of virtual com-
munities. In addition, for the first time, our methodology provides the social and 
communication sciences practitioners with an approach for the identification and 
organization of community information systems in order to allow the reception, 
memorizing, stocking, processing and analysis of these management and sharing 
platform and systems that we call DSS. This design methodology, by modeling 
design and instantiation tool configuration, represents a programming effort des-
tined to managers that are not familiar with technology, non-expert designers in the 
civil society and to computational social science and communication researchers 
through digital social media. Far from the formal programming languages and com-
puting codes, they allow to configure into natural language the necessary tools for 
the construction of community information systems specific to support DSS activi-
ties or a virtual organization.

9.2  The Foundations: The Systems Sciences as a Research 
Field
Regarding the applications related to human relations and the development of digi-
tal social systems and virtual organizations, the systems sciences can contribute to 
model and provide an online DSS construction methodology that should be a grow-
ing concern for a transformational social science and communication models ori-
ented towards change at the service of humanity (Laszlo and Laszlo 2003). Contrary 
to the field of engineering systems, social sciences have not yet seriously taken into 
account systems sciences and social systems (Luhmann 1989, 1995; Banathy and 
Jenks 1991; Banathy 1987; Hofkirchner 2007, 2008; Fuchs 2003, 2008) to enrich 
their comprehension of the human activity systems’ evolution into a large-­scale 
network.
Community informatics design (Harvey 2008, 1996) that very early on had some 
interest in the systemic approaches is part of numerous fields of knowledge that 
have recently emerged relying on the systems’ approach to organize the world and 
interpret it and add upon (Brill 1999). The systemic vision gives a distinct perspec-
tive on humans and nature (Laszlo 1972), without dividing them nor incorporating 
them without discernment. It seeks a holistic world vision; in that sense, it is a con-
trast with the traditional “reductionist” visions. Instead of favouring systems that 
are disintegrated by the obsessive analysis in more and more simple elements, 
reduced to their simpler expressions for the analysis commodities, the systems’ 
approach embraces a global, holistic vision of the world (Popper 1961, 1972; 
M’Pherson 1974).
9.3  The Notion of a System
The notion of systems designates the manifestations of natural phenomena and pro-
cesses that satisfy certain general conditions. In its wider classical design, it con-
notes a set of complex components in interaction, including the relations they 
maintain between them, which allows to identity a frontier entity and a dynamic 
maintenance process of this frontier. As we will see further, several definitions and 
different formulations have been given since the foundation of systems’ sciences. 
For the purpose of our works, we will start by a definition based on the works of 
Russell Ackoff (1974) and Ackoff and Emery (1972), one of the founders of the 
social systems design theory (Ackoff 1974). A system represents a series of two or 
several linked elements that meet the following criteria:
	1.	 Each element has an effect on the entire operating.
	2.	 Each element is influenced by at least one other element of the system.
	3.	 All possible element subgroups also possess both first properties.
9.3  The Notion of a System

284
By replacing the concept of “elements” (Laszlo 1972) by the “component” 
(Bunge 2003), it is possible to get to a relevant definition for the identification of 
any type of system, whether it is formal (mathematics, computer coding, program-
ming language), existential (lived world of Habermas 1984), emotional (aesthetic, 
harmonious, emotional, imaginative, creative) or linguistics (semiotic, semantics, 
pragmatic). In each case, the system is a whole made of a series of elements or 
components in interaction. Thus, in its most fundamental definition, a system is a 
group of components in interaction, containing a sum of components in addition to 
their reciprocal relations (the system itself) by entertaining a certain form of identi-
fiable relations with other systems.
9.4  Recent Trends in Social Sciences and Systems Sciences
The exploration of the systems sciences development by its more eminent represen-
tatives (Laszlo et al. 2002) shows us that its history can be retraced through a great 
diversity of intellectual activities and application efforts. For the commodity of our 
work, we will make here a certain number of distinctions. If we refer to the general 
field of theory of general systems, the first distinction to establish resides in, on the 
one hand, the development of ideas and the systems perspectives as such and, on the 
other hand, the application of the system idea in the existing disciplines (like the 
application of the system concept to engineering study programs, social systems 
design and the design of DSS and virtual organizations in communication and social 
sciences). This distinction allows us to distinguish two main fields of research on 
systems.
We can also distinguish various systemic fields in themselves: on one side, the 
purely theoretical development of the system’s idea and their inter-relations, and on 
the other side, the applied perspective, with the objective to develop systemic ideas 
in various fields of application in the real world. The general systems theory by Von 
Bertalanffy (1968) represents an example of the first field while the development of 
engineering systems or social systems an example of the second one. There are, of 
course, classification examples that lead us to distinguish three kinds of systems: the 
hard systems like engineering systems, the soft systems that serve to characterize 
naturally “imprecise” problems (Moles and Rohmer 1986) and the mist systems, 
mainly used in operational research and socio-technical approaches.
The systems’ classification between hard and soft represents an effort to attract 
the attention to both the degree of knowledge we have regarding a system and the 
systems’ objectives or the underlying intentions of its development. Peter Checkland 
(1976, 1981), Checkland and Howell (1998) and Checkland and Scholes (1990) 
have developed this classification, largely taken up in the field of information sys-
tems and technology management that represents a continuum going from the for-
malization of a system to its semi-formalization and its openness, more or less big 
depending on the case.
9  Toward a Discovery and Strategic Alignment Matrices for Socio-technical Systems’ Design

285
A hard system like a telecommunication infrastructure or a network application 
is easier to define because its goals and intentions can be clearly defined. It is often 
the case of engineers in various fields like architecture or a software creation, to 
create machines, processes, smart agents, home automation systems, planes, trains 
or automobiles, for example. However, the intentions’ simplicity and the clarity of 
frontiers do not guarantee the modeling, design or implantation facility. The entire 
current field of systems engineering is currently looking into the role of possible 
researches in social sciences to incorporate important factors that are a lot less quan-
tifiable, but those are important dimensions to a system’s success. A socio-technical 
system like the construction of a hospital contains highly complex dimensions.
At the other extreme are the soft systems that are characterized by human beings 
as main elements. These systems are difficult to define because they are blended 
with the existence and are often accompanied by technology. Without well-defined 
boundaries, they often contain vague intentions. The socio-technical systems we 
will mention below are part of it. At the virtual organization level and multi-person 
DSS and the widen elaboration in time and space, we often encounter disciplinary 
alignment problems, contentious visions and coordination problems that operate 
simultaneously. The objectives and aspects to be prioritized can then change with 
time. The design problems are therefore more complex.
9.4.1  Critical Systems Thinking
Recent works in the field of soft systems resulted in a promising thinking move-
ment, not well known from the humanities and social science researchers that are 
called “emancipatory systems thinking”. This field of knowledge that leads to criti-
cal systems thinking adopts an epistemological position that voluntarily leaves aside 
the ontological considerations to defend a critical and complimentary use of various 
systemic approaches and a disciplinary and methodological pluralism.
The critical systems thinking is a recent and solid research trend in the work 
studies oriented on humanist perspectives. Under the direction of pioneer research-
ers like Banathy (1992, 1996, 2000), Banathy and Jenks (1991), Floyd and Jackson 
(1991), Ulrich (1983, 1990), Ulrich and Reynolds (2010) and Romm (1996, 2002, 
2006), all, to a certain point, disciples of Churchman (1968, 1971, 1974), one of the 
founders of emancipatory social systems thinking, this approach seeks to adapt the 
concept of “knowledge constitutive interests” according to Jurgen Habermas (1973, 
1984), as well as Michel Foucault’s interpretive analytical orientations, in a meta-
methodology that incorporates a constant critical reflection. This methodology 
serves as a base to the generation of a new methodology that applies various critical 
systems thinking to problem-solving, especially critical social conscience, comple-
mentary methodology, complementary theory and the emancipation of human 
beings.
In social systems design, a person possessing a critical conscience is able to 
analyse the premises, the orientations and the underlying theoretical weaknesses to 
9.4  Recent Trends in Social Sciences and Systems Sciences

286
the methods and techniques used, whether in the consideration of a society tier, a 
systemic level or the entirety of a system. Social conscience brings into play the 
society environment and the organizational culture that influence the appropriation 
of a given system or the one of a social system through time and space. Methodological 
plurality and complementarity are interested in the use of various techniques and 
methods in order to achieve the objectives, to satisfy the intentions of a project or to 
realize certain activities. Finally, the notion of human emancipation seeks to create 
an improvement for individuals and to enhance the quality of life while being at the 
service of the commitment of concerned people by a cultural or organizational 
intervention.
9.4.2  Total Systems Intervention
One of the highly interesting subgroups of critical systems thinking is the total sys-
tems intervention. This approach starts from the principle of all problem-solving 
methods that are complementary. The conditions required for each problem-solving 
situation or design project planning gather the best applicable methods to each 
aspect of the problem. The selection of methods, modeling or collaboration tools 
and the intervention media is a particular configuration, an organization of specific 
elements for each project, that is accomplished by the community informatics 
expert, specialist of organizational collaboration supported by creativity tools, col-
laboration social media, project management tools and certain operational proce-
dures. These procedures can greatly contribute to harmonize social media and the 
DSS strategies, according to three total systemic intervention modalities: the critical 
revision mode, the problem-solving mode and the critical reflection mode.
Even if critical systems thinking opens large new social sciences and communica-
tion that must contend with the development of socio-technical systems, this 
approach bears the imprint of a dominating rationality that serves as a conceptual 
structure enveloping the reality it seeks to observe and upon which it seeks to inter-
vene. This approach seeks to emphasize the purely epistemological aspects of the 
system’s theory. Other theories stemming from this perspective try to develop a more 
normative design of the system’s reality. In digital social systems, we insist less on 
the technological information characteristics and telecommunications than on the 
values that guide their appropriation in change projects supported by vast techno-
logical systems (social media platforms, business ecosystem, collaboration charts).
It is especially the case of the multimodal systems thinking put forward by J.D.R. 
de Raadt (2000, 2001) that suggests a research perspective where human reason is 
part of a normative, supra-subjective and supra-arbitrary order. This normative 
order is supposed to precede reason and rationality and to determine the status of 
reason and the limits of science. In socio-technical projects, the complete control of 
traditional rational management and complete formalization in engineering systems 
collide with intuition, with the non-quantifiable, with emergence and with “enlight-
ened improvisation”.

9.4.3  The General Theory of Evolution
Since the 1990s, action systems oriented on the development of human and natural 
systems emerge from the study of evolutive processes in the environment and soci-
ety. This approach is known as the “evolutive systems general theory”. The general 
evolution of the universe is made of a “cosmic process” that manifests itself by 
event and situation sequences largely overflowing the physical or biological phe-
nomena’s framework to extend to a multitude of complex dynamic systems’ evolu-
tion aspects like social systems and with Internet’s advent, the DSS, through 
information, knowledge management and the generalized collaboration mecha-
nisms in virtual organizations. As we have shown in our book entitled Cyberespace 
et communautique (Harvey 1995), the evolution of structures goes from atoms to 
stars, from great apes to the human being and from rudimentary forms of social 
structures to the creation of complex societies.
Today, the dominating organizational phenomenon resides in the evolution of 
virtual network cooperation/collaboration structures that go from the personal web-
site to the virtual mega-communities of global social networks (UNESCO, OCDE, 
The World Bank, USAID). Human societies evolve through the convergence of 
organizational levels that are higher and higher to informational levels that fluctuate 
at various levels of society. When the flows of people, information, knowledge, 
energy, products and technological applications reach a certain “critical mass”, they 
transcend the social systems’ formal frontiers. In our 1993 doctoral thesis, we had 
shown that small tribes and neighbouring villages converge towards ethnic com-
munities or better incorporated organizations that, in return, will become cities, 
regions, conurbations, countries, provinces, states, nations and, eventually, vast 
empires. All these evolutive states represent not only various levels of society that 
are in accordance with our CAPACITÉS model but also social information levels 
that articulate themselves at different levels of reality. These various levels of social 
information have been put forward by Jacques Jaffelin in Le promeneur d’Einstein 
(1991). Figure 9.1 highlights these social information levels that any social systems 
designer should master in order to understand better the context of uses. The differ-
ent round charts illustrate an evolutive continuum of the social information com-
plexification that has been emerging since the dawn of humanity. Each round chart 
contains a different level of universal impact information. Each level represents a 
different information status that relies on the previous round charts; it commands 
specific design skills like the ones that consist of aligning and organizing the infor-
mation in a portal according to the various targeted publics, according to the infor-
mation status and in accordance with the available media tools in various design 
situations. This hierarchy is not without reminding the levels of needs from the 
Maslow pyramid or the CAPACITÉS model’s society level diagram.
Currently, we are witnessing the explosion of new forms of socialization and 
online social structures that go from the individual websites to the great strategic 
and collaborative alliances through practice communities and the innovation com-
munities’ platforms, through an organizational, cultural, economic, political and

technological convergence. Together, the humanity puts in place the complex gov-
ernance processes of multiple stakeholders by creating vast political and economic 
blocks like the European Community, NAFTA, ASEAN, UNASUR, etc.
The “bifurcation” notion (Hofkirchner), which is non-linear space and time tran-
sitions and often undetermined between the system’s states (see Fig. 10.1), allows 
community informatics design to analyse, under the angle of the evolutive systems 
theory, the conditions that prevail in a social system that undergoes changes or 
transformations at a precise moment, in a particular space. Community informatics 
design reorganizes its structures to establish a new socio-dynamic regime (a new 
culture, policies, socio-technical design properties, the systems’ state and transi-
tion) that could be founded on the previous components and past bifurcations or 
disintegrated in more stable individual components. The bifurcation concept refers 
to the revolutionary transformations our social systems, our systems and social vir-
tual organizations and the entire society endure. The reins of power change hands, 
the work division design and its coordination are redone; virtual communities are 
born, thanks to networking; new ideas emerge, like the open massive transborder 
innovation; new social movements rely on technology; and new behaviours and 
lifestyles appear and take the initiative. When the order is re-established, transfor-
mational chaos disappears leaving room for a new, more stable system state.
Immanuel Wallerstein (quoted in Harvey 2004a) teaches us that bifurcations can 
be calm and continuous but also explosive, catastrophic, abrupt and absolutely unpre-
dictable. This is why we must try to anticipate the future of our societies in a sense 
that is favourable and that ensures the future of the specie. Thus, facing uncertainties 
and global disruptions in our current world, the community informatics expert and 
the systems designer must be attentive to the bifurcation our social systems are expe-
riencing, by exploring and selecting scenarios and alternative solutions likely to give 
a satisfying answer to periods of indetermination and large-scale disruptions.
The general theory of evolutive systems is founded on the fundamental transdis-
ciplinary orientations, on the integration of principles of the general systems theory, 
cybernetics and systemics, information and communication theories, the complex-
ity and chaos theory, the theory of dynamic systems, the thermodynamics and all 
relevant science for the analysis, modeling and design of a DSS. Community infor-
matics design, by using these sciences as a foundation, gives itself tools and means 
to understand underlying laws, rules and the socio-dynamic that govern the evolu-
tion of complex social systems in various fields of investigation. The basic concepts 
of these new disciplines can be developed in a way to show the dynamic and rapid 
evolution of digital social system and socio-technical systems.
9.4.4  Social Systems Design
Open social systems design represents a field of research that is relatively new and 
unknown among the communication and social science researchers. Yet, its integra-
tor framework based on the systemic approach makes it an interesting

transdisciplinary approach, able to bridge the gap between disciplines like comput-
ing, information systems and community information systems, management and 
technology. Among the pioneers of the first wave are Simon (1969), Jones (1970), 
Churchman (1971), Jantsch (1976, 1980) and Warfield (1976). The memorable year 
for this approach was 1981, marked by contributions from Ackoff (1974), Ackoff 
and Emery (1972), Checkland (1981), Nadler (1981), followed by Argyris (1982, 
1993a, b), Ulrich (1983), Cross (1974, 1984, 2001) and Banathy (1984, 1996, 1999, 
2004). More recently, researchers like Laszlo and Laszlo (2004), Reigeluth and 
Jenlink (2008), Fuchs (2008) and Hofkirchner (2008, 2013) have continued 
Banathy’s work in similar directions, with the creation of “evolutionary systems 
design” we will see in the next section.
Social systems design has emerged recently as a manifestation of open systems 
thinking corresponding to the soft systems approaches. As a research discipline 
oriented towards the anticipation and the creation of the future, it incorporates both 
a component focused of the results and a component focused on the decision-­
making. We will see that these two components are important for the DSS commu-
nity informatics design. The first is related to research in the classical sense of the 
word with a strong component in social and communication sciences. It uses vari-
ous disciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches. The second 
perspective is less interested in research results than in the knowledge application 
results; in this sense, it tends more concrete problems’ investigation, a way to create 
pragmatic knowledge and applications favouring intentional social change.
This last idea is important for the communication research or the social science 
practitioner dealing with new digital fields. While the “information systems” and 
the “organization theory” traditional methods, including the “organizational com-
munication” one, have failed or, at least, were tardy to offer a clear vision of virtual-
ity, virtual communities, collaborative network organizations containing horizontal 
organizational architectures and new forms of governance put in place by stakehold-
ers and partners groups, the information community and socio-technical systems 
methods (Whitworth and De Moor 2009), pragmatic Web and the languages/action 
theories (Goldkuhl and Lind 2010; Te’eni, 2006; Winograd, 2006) and symbolic 
action perspective in information systems (Aakhus 2014) have wanted to fill this 
gap since the beginning of the century. All the works, more and more known on 
“organizational semiotics” and “cybersemiotics” (Brier 2000, 2008, 2013), can also 
help us in the design of digital social systems and community information systems 
by incorporating the social, pragmatic and semantics levels (Krippendorff 2007).
In fact, the social systems design approach seeks to understand a creation and 
collaboration situation (e.g. the creation of a scientific collaborative portal on social 
Web’s platforms or a business design platform) as a set of interconnected, 
­interdependent and interactive processes. Therefore, solutions they seek to suggest 
(alternatives, design resumption, reuse, planning emerging from a vision that incor-
porates multiple aspects; Basden 2000) go well beyond the traditional information 
systems approach that went from an information technology application paradigm 
to an opportunity to build a new social field: the social Web, media and socio-tech-
nical networks that support the co-creation and design of new social systems and

collaborative virtual organizations; in short, community informatics design is the 
social systems design to which human factor perspectives, socio-technical systems 
(Clegg 2000) and social computing are added (Kling 1973, 1999, 2007; Kling et al. 
2005). These research orientations favour the design of future virtual social ecosys-
tems thanks to a holistic comprehension better documented of the dynamic govern-
ing online social systems as living and organic systems. This means that all citizens 
can and must take the responsibility of socio-technical systems design for the co-
creation of our future, in interdependence with all the involved stakeholders in the 
co-development of a system. These are the computing enterprise participating citi-
zens as users/designers (Harvey 2010), the universities’ colabs, the democratic liv-
ing labs and the responsible policies of various government levels.
By its nature, DSS design is a participative activity: it is not the business of 
experts, and the significant changes currently required in our societies are led to 
terms only by communities that are affected at the first degree by these new systems 
that solicit them and choose their orientations and the way to implant them. If we 
consider that the information systems in the enterprises and in the current electronic 
commerce industry and the services can be considered like digital social systems, 
we will admit that people and communities represent the critical factor and the main 
beneficiaries of their potential socio-economic validation effects. Furthermore, we 
will concede that it is essential that it be them to undertake the changes and trans-
formations and that we should incorporate them in our efforts. This process is every-
one’s business; it gives a fundamental role to social science researchers in modeling, 
design, virtual communities and Internet socio-critical systems implantation.
In accordance with the basic social systems design philosophy (Banathy 1987), 
DSS community informatics design, realized with the help of social Web collabora-
tive creativity tools and the open-source code, support the “participative democ-
racy” through which people directly engage in the issues and activities that mainly 
concern them. It is a fundamental orientation that will guide the implantation of a 
citizen portal in the setting of the research focus works 3, entitled “Online 
Democracy”, from the Commission citoyenne sur les droits et l’harmonisation des 
relations interculturelles’s project funded by the Conseil de recherche en sciences 
humaines du Canada (under our colleague’s direction: Mireille Tremblay). To 
understand this research orientation well from a scientific point of view, we take our 
inspiration from the systems’ theoretician Bela Banathy (2000, 2001) and Banathy 
and Jenks (1991) that characterizes the systems as follows: “Science focuses on the 
natural world’s study. It seeks to describe what exists. Centred on the research of 
problems, it studies and describes problems in various fields. Humanities focus on 
comprehension and the discussion of the human experience”. In design, we focus on 
the research of solutions and the creation of objects and value systems that do not 
yet exist.
The scientific methods include controlled experiments, classifications, acknowl-
edgement models, analyses and deductions. In humanities, we apply the analogy, 
the metaphor, the critic and the evaluation. In design, we divide alternative situa-
tions, we create models, we make synthesis and we use situations and solution 
models.

Science promotes objectivity, rationality and neutrality. It cares about the truth. 
Social sciences validate subjectivity, imagination and commitment. It cares about 
justice. Design validates pragmatism, ingenuity, creativity and empathy. (And we 
add abduction.) It cares about the alignment equity and the impact of design on 
future generations.
9.4.5  Evolutive Socio-technical Systems Design: Community 
Informatics Design as a New Digital Skill
Recent efforts to apply the general evolution theory to the design of social systems 
mediatized by and through social media and collaborative platforms as socio-­
technical systems (Trist and Bamforth 1951; Trist 1953; Emery 1993; Weisbord 
1992; Badham et al. 2000; Fischer and Konomi 2007; Whitworth and de Moor 
2009; De Moor 2005) mark the rise of community informatics design as one of the 
social intelligence technologies allowing the computer-mediatized social participa-
tion (Fischer 2010, 2013a, b; Giaccardi and Fischer 2008) with the help of “innova-
tion colabs”. Evolutive socio-technical systems design is a praxeological field 
(Moles and Rohmer 1986, 1998; Moles 1990; Moles and Jacobus 1988; Le Moigne 
1979a, b, 1983) oriented on the creation of evolutive crossroads for the sustainable 
development of life on Earth. As a research discipline, it tries to validate the work 
of social science and information and communication science practitioners to define 
what could be “socially responsible communicational design”. The evolutive com-
munity information systems designer is called a community informatics expert (or 
a “communitician”). He has the responsibility to strategically align systems, like 
social, organizational and technological architectures he creates through socio-­
dynamic means (Moles and Rohmer 1998; Moles 1967), cultural change and pat-
terns and behavioural interaction models and collaboration that intervene in the 
development of virtual environments put at the service of our societies’ sustainable 
development.
Relying on the general evolution theory (Laszlo 2004; Heylighen 2007) as well 
as on their methodological concepts of social systems’ design approaches (organi-
zational semiotics, semio-pragmatism, cybersemiotics, the activity theory, conver-
sational and multi-aspect design), as well as on the new field of computer-mediatized 
social participation, the evolutive community informatics design faces challenges 
arisen until now by an intentional strategic monitoring of decision assistance 
­systems dedicated to the environment and the sustainability of our planet ecosys-
tems. This implies that we would engage in the co-creation of our future in an evolu-
tive interdependence (Harvey 1995) with our social and natural environments.
This approach is based on the belief that we are able, on one hand, to configure 
our future in a way that it would be favourable, thanks to our self-organizing capac-
ity to understand multiple aspects, characteristics and required conditions by our 
environment and, on the other hand, to realize it according to an ethical design 
9  Toward a Discovery and Strategic Alignment Matrices for Socio-technical Systems’ Design

293
approach that respects our values, our aspirations and our expectations. The orienta-
tions of this praxeology and this pragmatic philosophy have been elaborated for 
40 years already from the pioneer researchers program from The Club of Rome 
(Ozbekhan 1969; Christakis 1987, 2010) and is currently ongoing within the objec-
tives of the European projects called FuturICT Flagship, which seeks to understand 
and manage socially interactive, complex and global systems by highlighting dura-
bility and resilience (Bishop et al. 2011; Lukowicz and Conte 2011). According to 
researchers that promote this pilot project, to reveal the hidden laws and processes 
that underlie the “evolution” of our societies represents the biggest and more urgent 
scientific challenge of our century (Helbing 2010, 2011, 2012a, b).
According to the promoters of this approach that unites researchers from all hori-
zons and various countries, the integration of three fundamental fields, information 
and communication technologies, complexity sciences and social sciences, will 
lead to a change in paradigm that will facilitate the symbiotic co-evolution (De 
Rosnay 1975) of ICT and society. Large-scale monitoring systems will provide 
massive data and information coming from our global complex information sys-
tems. This data is collectively generated from the global data base in order to 
develop durable models of socio-technical and economic systems. The results will 
allow to better understand the global functioning of our social systems and to docu-
ment the design and development of a new generation of ICT systems that are 
socially adaptive, self-organized and co-built in, by, for and through energy and 
intelligent collaboration of vast collectives of actors. “Having become conscious 
about the evolution, we must make the evolution conscious now. If this is what we 
want, the next step in the development of human societies can be intentionally 
guided” (Laszlo and Laszlo 2003).
To do so, we will have to multiply, for Quebec, Canada and the rest of the world, 
disciplinary crossroads and trans-profession practice fields, where individuals and 
communities will collaborate, according to their own desire to get involved in new 
socio-political contracts, in the reflexive co-design of knowledge representation 
systems put at the service of the creation of flexible social, resilient, open and 
favourable systems to the human being.
Community informatics design of evolutive social systems supports an “antici-
patory democratic philosophy” where people and civil society apply their digital 
socially and ecologically responsible multi-skills by becoming active participants in 
the conscious definition of our future. Innovative ICT practice communities engaged 
in community informatics and evolutive socio-technical design make an evolutive 
learning user/designer community (Harvey 2010; Laszlo et al. 2010), and this type 
of local or extended community by telepresence (Moles 1973) and remote 
­collaborative networks favour the emergence of an “evolutive design culture”. This 
process is destined to the improvement of “evolutive socio-technical skills” of all 
citizens: a universal and generic appropriation mechanism leading to an improve-
ment of digital literacy. Digital literacy refers to a desirable state of individuals 
update, human communities and vast collectives of actors involved in large-scale 
socio-technical projects, a state that is marked by the cognitive and social ICT mas-
tery, through the knowledge capacities, practical abilities of media and social 
9.4  Recent Trends in Social Sciences and Systems Sciences

294
platform appropriation, by a critical attitude towards emancipation tools and meth-
odologies and by the required values for collaboration and ICT-mediatized design 
activities. Digital literacy validated by digital badges represent a whole program of 
research based on our UQAM’s Applied Community Informatics Laboratory 
(ACIL), in Montreal.
Along with literacy, digital literacy should be promoted and taught at all levels of 
the education system and society as a whole. It is an essential condition for massive 
innovation and the pursuit of more sustainable modes of existence. It is the duty of 
social science oriented towards the improvement of life quality and a socially 
responsible communicational design to favour the emergence of such an emancipa-
tion culture for all, where large-scale technological projects intervene (see the next 
section). These modes of life and survival for our societies join the co-creation of 
products, services, applications and change processes in terms of numerous social 
systems aspects that can be socially desirable, culturally emancipatory, psychologi-
cally validating, economically sustainable, technologically feasible, operationally 
viable, environmentally friendly and generationally sensible.
The analysis, monitoring and evaluation of all these aspects simultaneously 
exceed the skills of a single individual and require the implementation of robust 
virtual environments (Darzentas and Spyrou 1995) where creativity and collabora-
tion tools can help develop adaptative and evolutive alignment strategies that will 
ensure the longevity and maintenance of new ecosystems at various levels of society 
(individuals, groups, organizations, practice communities, collaborative networks, 
social systems, global network systems).
In accordance with our CAPACITÉS modeling approach, based on De Moor 
theories (2005) and Whitworth and De Moor (2009), community informatics design 
of evolutive systems seeks to identify opportunities to increase the dynamic stability 
and the self-creation of social systems through various levels of society, in interac-
tion with an array of components that are larger than in traditional engineering sys-
tems, according to different temporalities and spaces (e.g. the efforts of Léo 
Semashko in tetrasociology).
In the image of expressed aspirations by the vast FuturICT Flagship European 
project, we would like to suggest a project where vast fields of knowledge could 
illustrate the evolutive and emancipatory potential associated with various fields and 
where society in its whole could benefit from the different investing efforts in the 
complex dynamic systems that globally limit the scientific field of community 
informatics design of the future social systems (we will present this project at the 
end of the present chapter). The strategic monitoring and the technological intelli-
gence of literacy and digital skills of all citizens become, in accordance with the 
results of our APSI research realized with the financial help of the Secrétariat du 
Conseil du Trésor du Québec, one of the main objectives of evolutive community 
informatics design.
Thanks to the implementation and the experimentation of democratic socio-­
technical platforms that promote the involvement of individuals and communities in 
the co-creation of “crossroads” specific to the sustainable evolutive development 
and the harmonization of international efforts for the balance between the human

being and nature, we seek in the present book to define the foundations and prac-
tices of evolutive learning communities in community informatics design in the 
field of general science and in the field of social and communication sciences in 
particular. In the next section, we will examine large-scale technological projects 
from the tetrasociology, socionics and sociocybernetics angle.
In the context of a citizen commitment process in the sociological imagination 
(C. Wright Mills) and the creation of transdisciplinary bridges (or “crossroads”), the 
current research on evolutive community informatics design seeks to promote and 
adapt synthetic models of evolutive learning communities in community informat-
ics design in the real world, for example, “the intelligent worlds” (Abdoullaev 
2011), collaborative virtual environments, innovation co-design in virtual commu-
nities (Brandtzaeg et al. 2010) and the intelligent cities (Komninos and Tsarchopoulos 
2013; Komninos 2003). Alexander and Katia Laszlo (Laszlo et al. 2010) define an 
evolutive learning community like a group of two or several individuals possessing 
a common intention, a common identity as well as a commitment in the co-creation 
of spheres of meaning seeking to develop evolutive skills through the co-design 
“learn-to-learn” (Nicolescu 1996, 2010), in harmony with the dynamics of their 
own physical and sociocultural environment. Evolutive learning communities in 
community informatics design do not want to adapt the environment to the mem-
bers’ needs nor to unilaterally adapt the members’ needs to the environment. Instead, 
they jointly mature the major issues of our time by the harmonization of co-creation 
and co-design processes, a socio-dynamic of sharing resources that aim the sustain-
able co-development. Problems are transformed into issues, uncertainty situations 
are considered like perspectives and individual dreams become collective projects. 
From these dynamics and activities, digital and social skills are increased, which 
allows to validate the comprehension of organizations and change models and pat-
terns associated with any complex dynamic system through energetics and informa-
tional transformation.
In connection with social and communication sciences, complexity sciences and 
the ICT transdisciplinary field, community informatics design of evolutive social 
systems provides theoretical foundations and evolutive governance principles of 
coordination/collaboration/evolutive communication and ethics. It makes us think 
that the harmonization of human activities and the balance of human future can be 
entrusted to the citizen and the civil society as long as it is possible to create today 
the necessary skills for the use of creativity and design tools at the service of strate-
gies, alignments and harmonization platform through which we could, together, 
guide the sustainable and desirable development of our societies and 
organizations.
The fact that community informatics design of evolutive social systems can cur-
rently rise is related to substantial advances in several fields, especially social and 
collaborative Internet platforms, social systems design and conversational design, 
modeling and human activity visualization tools and the research of a form of criti-
cal systems thinking that gives it an emancipatory and harmonizing interest that 
relies on soft systems approach, critical systems approach, emancipatory systems 
approach, massive educational orientations of remote and permanent education and

the learning communities in community informatics design supporting these orien-
tations. The result is a DSS approach supported by the ICT, oriented in a humanist 
way, understood as a meta-methodology, a meta-design (Fischer 2013a), that 
accompanies and facilitates the critical application of various aspects of socio-­
technical systems to the numerous situations of the real world.
9.4.6  The Socio-technical Design Culture
The 2009 publication of the book by Brian Whitworth and Aldo de Moor entitled 
Handbook of Research on Socio-Technical Design is an important turning point in 
the research issues and approaches on evolutive socio-technical systems. The social 
interaction and action are at the heart of this approach. Socio-technical systems are 
described as computing technologies that validate social interactions of all types, 
whether for email or blog conversations, chat groups, collective writing (wikis), 
e-commerce (eBay), online learning (Web City, Moodle, Dokeos), social network-
ing (LinkedIn, Facebook), co-design or modeling (mind maps, Cmap). Whitworth 
and De Moor note that the Internet has evolved from the content generation and 
static data base applications hosting towards global communication platforms. 
According to them, like ICT that become an integral part of social life, the social 
world should also be part of technical design. Without it, a “socio-technical gap” 
emerges, which translates to a deficit between what society considers desirable and 
what makes technology.
Socio-technical systems rise when social systems emerge from technical systems 
that can expand from small collaborative groups to great technological systems 
(GST) documented by Hughes (1983, 1987, 1990), with components that can be 
physical, legal, organizational, institutional, community or societal (Ostrom and 
Hess 2011). They contain complex interaction patterns encompassing invention, 
discovery, economic development and social innovation systems. Whitworth and 
De Moor (2009) consider the socio-technical field as transdisciplinary; they believe 
no university discipline can avoid this field nowadays. From the communication and 
social sciences stand point, the socio-technical systems approach transcends the 
human-computer interaction, the community information systems, the computer-­
assisted collaborative work and the computer-mediatized communication (Harvey 
2010). Depending on the situation or the project, we will resort to communication 
theories or the perspectives of the language-action movement, the pragmatic Web or 
the cognitive sciences, the engineering systems, computing, health and education 
sciences, sociology, business management and more recently the symbolic action 
perspective.
Krippendorff (2007), great communication and human-centred design specialist, 
assures the movement we tend to call human-centred design unites all these 
approaches.1 The assumption is that technology or the infrastructures are not “defi-

297
nite static data” but entities co-created by humans for their own use instead of from 
technology for its own purposes. In this sense, two authors join the promoters of 
evolutive design:
In the end, the global humanity must control guide and define computing, la technology that 
is transforming humanity and maybe we need to change what is changing us in order to 
survive. If society is the context of technology and not the other way around, we have to 
define the conditions, designs and measures technology will have to follow. (Whitworth and 
De Moor 2009)
This is why in our conceptualization of community informatics design, as socio-­
technical problems are put in context and resolved, it becomes important for the citi-
zens and the society in general to consider the critical systems thinking to envision 
socio-technical questions. A highly “technologized” society like ours is affected by 
the growing innervation of the social fabric by technologies, but it can also “social-
ize” the technology it contributes to create. Conversely, technological designs exist 
within a social context; they must integrate this context in their modeling to grow in 
harmony with social requirements.
Thus, socio-technical systems are essentially hybrids: they contain a mix of 
socio-cognitive structures, complex social structures, hard infrastructures and soft 
architectures that are difficult to model. The development of technical systems and 
DSS by community informatics design is a complex socio-technical approach and 
is difficult to realize since it tries to balance and harmonize human and social aspira-
tions (Harvey 1995) with the constraints and challenges brought by technologies. 
We do not think this is an easy task to realize at first, but we hope that the matrix and 
combination model we present in this chapter will answer most of the requirements 
expressed by different users/designers having different worldviews and many types 
of digital skills.
9.4.7  The Socio-technical Interaction Network Methodology
In this spirit and according to this approach, one of the most eminent of social com-
puting, referred to by Whitworth and De Moor (2009), is Rob Kling (1973, 1996, 
1999, 2000a, b, 2007; Kling et al. 2005), and Kling et al. (2001), according to whom 
information and communication do not exist separately on the social or technologi-
cal plan (Lamb; Sawyer; Kling 1973, 1996, 2000a, b, 2007; Kling et al. 2001, 2005). 
According to Kling, several assumptions underlie a new social computing and com-
munity informatics research strategy called the socio-technical interaction network 
or STIN. Kling’s approach (2003) is an emerging conceptual structure aiming to 
identify, organize and analyse social interaction models, to develop systems and 
configure the components of an information system. Therefore, it is not a mature 
theory by an approach that seems promising. This is why we allow ourselves to add 
some theoretical elements, especially, as we will see further, Hughes’s elements on 
great technological systems (Scacchi 2006). Since 1991, Kling has considered the 
information systems foundations as network models designed like a set of equip-
ment, applications and techniques, containing identifiable capacities of information 
9.4  Recent Trends in Social Sciences and Systems Sciences

298
processing as replacement solutions to “engineering systems” that are centred on 
the infrastructure and equipment components, on their information processing com-
ponents and the formal organizational arrangements as “social action” base.
The socio-technical interaction network approach relies on the social construc-
tion of technology and on socio-technical approaches associated with researchers 
like Bijker and Pinch (1987), and we add Hughes and his large technological sys-
tems (1987, 1990, 1998). This last approach retains technical artefacts, legislative 
constraints, organizational structures and natural resources. Hughes defines large 
technological systems like open intentional systems that exist to solve problems and 
that interact in an environment containing two types of factors: the independent 
ones and those that depend on the systems. A large technological system distin-
guishes itself from its environment by control limits applied by other components of 
the system. These limits define the system’s frontiers.
Hughes talks about components by mentioning the concept of “system’s struc-
tures” that are both technical and socio-technical components in dynamic interac-
tion. He designs these systems like a hierarchical structure that seems to be the 
inventors, innovators, organizers and information systems’ managers’ preference. 
In the image of the complexity hierarchy evolving at various levels of the system 
and levels of society that compose our CAPACITÉS model presented in Chap. 4, 
Hughes defines and understands the structure of great technological systems like 
socio-technical systems in dynamic interaction. He informs researchers to be atten-
tive to the level of analysis often forgotten by the followers of traditional engineer-
ing hard approaches. Hughes introduces several tiers of analysis that translate 
various behaviours of systems, understood as evolutive models of large technologi-
cal systems. In this sense, his approach is compatible with Kling’s (1973, 1996, 
1999, 2000a, b, 2007; Kling et al. 2001, 2005) and the great evolutive systems one 
presented in the previous sections. It helps to better understand the dimensions 
involved in the design of great DSS that is currently exploding on the Web. It is also 
based on the actor-network theory associated with Latour (2008), Law and Callon’s 
works, from l’École des Mines in Paris.
All these approaches can differ from one another but all equally help to under-
stand the role of the social behaviour in the creation and use of technological arte-
facts. From the actor-network theory, the socio-technical interaction network 
maintains the concept of actors that can be a human or a non-human participant. In 
addition to assure that technology and the social are inseparable, Kling (1999, 2007) 
states that social behavioural theories should influence the choices related to techni-
cal design that the participants are incorporated in multiple interrelations ­intertwined 
and non-mediatized by technology and that they consequently possess multiple con-
tradictory commitments where sustainable development, routine and operating pro-
cedure questions are critical. In this context, the socio-technical interaction network 
and the great technological systems make two relevant approaches for the analysis, 
the development and design of multiple “inter-actor” network systems such as DSS 
that we define as large-scale socio-technical human activity systems that require 
important decision-making to ensure their development according to flexible, open, 
operational and evolutive options or scenarios.

299
9.4.8  Systems Oriented by the Context
All these approaches validate the postulate according to which the attention given to 
people, their uses and their socio-technical design skills is a rare resource and a lot 
more important than the information system in itself, even a community one. The 
American researcher Gerhard Fischer, one of this movement’s leaders, calls these 
“human-centred computing systems”. In a recent article, he develops a multidimen-
sional conceptual framework, the “context-oriented systems”, one that relies on a 
particular attention to the many dimensions of the context and that seeks to face this 
challenge by transcending the current socio-technical systems, which neglect cer-
tain aspects of the context without paying attention to the problems this negligence 
could create. This structural and process framework is based on an array of different 
systems, developed and evaluated by for 20 years to explore different dimensions of 
the context we will examine closely in Sect. 9.6.2, by presenting 15 socio-technical 
systems aspects of Andrew Basden (2000).
Fischer (2010, 2013a) tries to define the context elements more precisely, its 
aspects that would allow to provide the right information, at the right moment, at the 
right place, in the right way, to the right person. We add to it the requirement to 
provide the right knowledge to the members of a given virtual practice community. 
Thus, Fischer poses the challenges, the orientations and the “design negotiations” 
(potential dangers, gaps and promises). He gets an innovative conceptual frame-
work out of it for the design of the future generation of systems oriented by context. 
These systems will support the advanced interactions (collaboration processes), to 
assist people and practice communities in the appropriation of network knowledge, 
to make them more productive, more creative and more innovative, by insisting on 
several aspects that had been neglected until then by computer experts and engineer-
ing systems experts.
Therefore, according to Fischer (2012), a first important aspect of the context 
definition depends on the way to obtain information elements that concern them, 
among the following:
	1.	 In this new approach and in accordance with our DSS approach, open-source 
code software, ubiquitous computing and computing clouds allow people to 
commit to virtual environments that accompany them in the design, the 
­implantation, the surveillance and the monitoring that provide them with a myr-
iad of information on these activities.
	2.	 In design activities, the context is not a static entity with fixed properties but an 
entity with multiple aspects that are emerging and without definite boundaries. 
Some context aspects can be inferred with partial designs (interfaces, plans, 
drawings, project planning), but the designer might have to explicitly articulate 
his intention by precising more systematically the nature of certain 
components.
	3.	 Certain context parameters are determined by information and knowledge com-
ing from outside the virtual environments, for example, the members of a learn-
ing community that discuss around an interactive white board. Such environment

sometimes requires appropriation mechanisms to map external events and trans-
late them into computing objects; people can also provide this information 
explicitly, alone or in a group.
The second important context element is the way to design it, model it and rep-
resent it. One important challenge at this level is to infer high-level objectives from 
the observation of lower-level operations. For example, if the users must collec-
tively generate information on the context, the question of the objective consists of 
knowing who among the partners or the stakeholders is volunteering to realize these 
activities.
The third important question is to know to which project objectives or specific 
intentions the context aspects and information are destined. Instead of generating 
useless or too many contents, it is better to proceed by strategic alignment between 
the context, tools, methods and techniques and to ask questions like: Who says 
what? To whom? By which means? What for? With what intention? The creation of 
different discovery and strategic alignment matrices between a project’s objectives 
and socio-digital media may constitute an important design and creativity tool. 
While being careful of not creating an addition problem of “informational over-
load”, taking into account the context should contribute to optimize the planning of 
contents and knowledge for different groups and users’ communities.
Taking into account the context of design leads us to suggest a multidimensional 
research framework (Chap. 6), where the active users’ support becomes our priority 
intention for many tasks, for example: the design is centred on the users’ needs and 
aspirations; the contexts are differentiated and customized with their help; same 
with the articulation of the design intentions that are built with the 8C’s approach; 
the access to information and knowledge is realize through the sharing of several 
analysis tools and collaboration open-source code software. In all these activities, 
conversational design and co-design are seen as social learning activities coming 
from the cooperation between experts and non-experts, in different aspects of the 
programming and tools’ configuration context. And, finally, all the actors work on 
the alignment of all the elements around the DSS project. The underlying idea is to 
analyse community information systems with the angle of “participative culture” 
contexts.
In front of global and pressing systemic problems our world is facing, we must 
try to transcend the cognitive level of individual spirit to better apprehend the chal-
lenges of collective intelligence and mobilize the collaborative comprehension in 
the discovery of solutions that are favourable to man. We have seen that the solving 
of this problem requires network virtual social structures (like the DSS) that favour 
the human knowledge, organizations, capacities and their application to various 
fields of human activities, at work or elsewhere. The creation of collaborative virtual 
environments aiming at the planning of large-scale projects and the solving of prob-
lems to promote the work of virtual communities to analyse, synthesize and share 
knowledge in order to support the collective generation of contents, community 
informatics design, networking, citizen democracy as well as various activities of 
common knowledge around sustainable development. These knowledge-updating

activities seek to put the new co-design social structures at the service of the human 
being and require to promote a participative “design culture” like our two APSI 
questionnaires and our case studies have revealed the growing importance in Quebec 
and globally.
From this brief reminder and various elements mentioned above, we will now 
suggest a conceptual framework based on the ACIL works within the APSI pro-
gram, where we have led our research projects for 2 years. This semiformal concep-
tual framework will allow us to analyse and operationalize the instantiation strategy 
we have suggested in Sect. 7.2.
9.5  A Digital Social Systems Conceptualization: 
The Foundations
Let us remind that a conceptualization is a simplified world vision, represented 
towards a certain intention. It provides a base for a field of knowledge formally 
represented (or semiformally in social sciences), to represent the objects, concepts, 
aspects and other entities and elements we presume that exist in a given field of 
knowledge. Explicitly or implicitly, each socio-technical system relies on a certain 
conceptualization that describes its concepts, its class of components, its typology 
of values, its interactions and its relations.
In Sect. 7.2, we described and defined several elements of a conceptual frame-
work under construction for the analysis and design of socio-technical systems 
applicable to the structuring and development of digital social systems. This frame-
work aims to meet the challenge of better understanding the collaborative design 
assistance virtual environments and to suggest a practical design framework that 
expands well beyond the existing according to a conversational ontological co-­
design model. From Bunge’s works (1983, 2000, 2003, 2004a, b), our framework 
systematizes and semi-formalizes the identification and the definition of common 
fields to all DSS considered like socio-technical systems of a particular type. Our 
approach also incorporates philosophical foundations of complex evolutive systems 
that underlie the transdisciplinary works of the UQAM’s ACIL team.
These fields contain the following elements:
	1.	 The foundations of community informatics “design thinking” (ontology, meta-
physics, futurology, axiology, praxeology, epistemology) we have seen in Sects. 
2.9 and 2.10.
	2.	 The context (the multiple aspects) and the multiple design situations, at various 
levels of society and at various complexity degrees
	3.	 The environment and the exogenous (exostructure) and endogenous (endostruc-
ture) components
	4.	 The social and communication field (social network, social media-mediatized 
social network that consists of describing human and social dimensions, the DSS 
type of social structure and the interrelations between these two elements)

	5.	 The functionalities (including objectives and the intentions of the socio-­technical 
system or the DSS and its organizational, social and collaborative architectures
	6.	 The ICT that incorporates the physical and material architecture and the other 
DSS non-human components, especially the material, software, the infrastruc-
ture and the community information system
	7.	 Processes (methodologies, techniques, design and modeling sub-process, the 
activities realized by the socio-technical system, people, communities and 
machines).
9.6  DSS for Users: Design Oriented Towards Everyday Life 
(A Praxeological Ontology)
The practical objective is to remind the foundations of a general theory of commu-
nicational design processes destined to build collaborative DSS that, as we have 
seen, we wish to contribute to the design of a conscious evolutive design (Banathy 
1996; Laszlo and Laszlo 2003; Fuchs and Obrist 2010; Harvey 2010) that incorpo-
rates the technological and human aspects in a semiformal operational process 
resulting in the emergence of new social structures more favourable to man.
The design of a participative culture and a collaborative society requires not only 
a basic conceptual framework but also the construction of a transdisciplinary meth-
odology that incorporates nature, society, conscience and technology according to a 
cooperative mode. To do so, we must incorporate various levels of reality (Harvey 
1996) into an ecosystemic theory understood like a field of interactions that contains 
significant human relations and collaborative management modes focused on the 
quality of life of many as well as on social computing and natural sciences.
Our comprehension of systems reality, our society model, is not naturalist nor 
culturalist, reductionist or dualistic but praxeological (Brier et al. 2004). Our vision 
of reality is based on a non-reductionist, multidimensional and complex approach as 
suggested by Edgar Morin (1982, 1984, 1985, 1990) in his various books dedicated 
to system’s complexity. We represent the various aspects of reality from the angle of 
social and semiotics practices (Brier 2000, 2008, 2013; Gazendam 2001; Stamper 
et al. 2000). These semiotics design practices are represented in the problem-­solving 
process of the 8C, which is focused on three aspects: survival and evolution, social 
roles and power issues and balanced and a fulfilling life. In Chap. 4, we suggested a 
visual model of these various levels of reality the “semio-­pragmatic communication 
star”. We have coupled this model with a hierarchical vision of complex systems, 
the CAPACITÉS model. The semio-pragmatic ontological vision of the 8C, the 
CAPACITÉS model and the communication star form a series of seven great dimen-
sions taken into account for a communicational design approach.

9.6.1  The Multiple Aspects Contextualizing Community 
Information Systems
Based on a 2500-year-old critic of philosophical thinking, the Dutch philosopher 
Herman Dooyeweerd (1984) suggests an atypical approach of reality that allows us 
to address and build information systems and their connection to everyday life, in 
the image of de Habermas’ life world (1984), but in a more extensive way. 
Dooyeweerd (1984) suggests a deep critic of the theoretical, analytical, scientific 
and philosophical thinking. However, he shows that we must not abandon these 
formal forms of thinking like the anti-rationalist do because we can find promising 
links with their daily activities. We lack space to present in detail such an important 
approach. Our effort will consist of showing that an aspect-oriented approach could 
complete the object-oriented approaches in the design of community information 
systems seeking a sustainable information society. We will see that by linking them 
to relevant articulated questions in a discovery matrix, we can transform these ele-
ments into prodigious a creativity and reflection tool.
Mario Bunge, from McGill University, like several other contemporary thinkers, 
pre-suggests the possibility to adopt a theoretical attitude to understand the world. 
We fully adopt this attitude, even if other postures may differ from it. Thus, 
Dooyeweerd (1979) considers that this philosophical attitude constitutes a problem 
in itself, by adopting an attitude based on the flow of everyday life in order to reflect 
the various aspects the experience acquired day to day, within which he sees a curi-
ous coherence. Let us examine this closer. It is a contrast regarding the world to 
build, but not a contradiction. Basden (2000, 2002, 2006, 2008, 2010a, b) quotes, as 
an example, the elements (things) like a manufacture, a book and a trip to Mars, 
where we find aspects (multiple modalities), particularly physical, logical and legal, 
which cannot be processed each against the others. The physical causality strongly 
reverberates in the logical relation antecedent consequence and in the legal relation 
between intellectual property and afferent sanctions. We will examine these 15 
aspects in detail in Sect. 9.6.2.
On the basis of this experience modality, Basden argues that the logical aspect 
(or analytical) does not have a privilege position “above” other aspects, but it is not 
only one aspect among many, without any significance. If we recognize the ­historical 
importance of the analytical aspect in sciences and in philosophy, it is not to elevate 
it as a modality superior to the others but instead to differentiate the roles it can play 
in our behaviour as human beings. This is why it offers an important model that 
promotes the input of social sciences in the representation and modeling of basic 
concepts associated with information systems destined to online communities and 
DSS, as knowledge sharing systems for the innovation and the sustainable 
development.
The most popular knowledge representation approaches in the object-oriented 
models are the objects, the attributes, the qualitative and quantitative values that 
feed these attributes, methods and procedures, messages and languages and a lim-
ited number of relations between these various entities. For each of these elements, 
9.6  DSS for Users: Design Oriented Towards Everyday Life (A Praxeological Ontology)

304
we must ask ourselves questions like: Why such component was chosen to represent 
knowledge related to a specific field? To what extent is this choice appropriate in 
practice? Wand and Weber (1990a) have tried to root their information systems 
approach in the philosophical ontology of Bunge (2003, 2004b), as seen in Chap. 6, 
because they thought his works could directly apply to information systems. Wand 
and Weber retain the following grammatical concepts to map Bunge’ philosophical 
concepts:
•	 Things, properties, states (stable or unstable), events (internal or external, pre-
cisely defined or not), transformations, stories, couplings, class systems and 
types
•	 The relative laws: the state of the laws, the appropriate legal state spaces, the 
legal event spaces and the legal transformations (e.g. the sociocultural law evolu-
tion cycles according to Abraham Moles 1967)
•	 The concepts associated with the evolutive systems theory: the composition, the 
environments, the structure, the subsystems, the deconstruction and the structure 
level, to which we add the mechanisms or processes
The Wand and Weber (1990a) data model contains a vaster extent than the previ-
ous object-oriented computing models and an extended capacity to include appro-
priate elements to the knowledge representation in complex systems like DSS. But 
it does not go far enough to analyse the current context of “free source code” the 
innovation users/designers one that requires the use of natural language instead of 
strictly formal programming languages to represent the knowledge of the world we 
lived daily. The multimodalities of the Dooyeweerd model (1979, 1984) incorporate 
not only the formal science languages but also those of social sciences, letters and 
arts. Multiple languages can take into account and validate the programming skills 
of non-initiated and users in their role as developers of digital social systems in the 
spirit of “citizen science” and “social design”. By neglecting certain important 
aspects and plurality of the “lived world” of the user mass, we might end up with big 
mistakes and important socio-technical problems, like digital skills deficiency for 
the appropriation of information systems destined to the development of virtual 
communities and DSS.  The world, the worlds, is not strictly representable like 
things around the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems or independent like 
fields of meaning; we must analyse these things in relation with the world and its 
multiple dimensions.
In every day’s attitude (by opposition with the abstract world of experts’ data) 
and the lived world, multiple aspects can be taken into account. We can use an infor-
mation systems to compile socio-demographic data (logical aspect), as well as to 
share and comment them in a group setting (social aspect), or to keep confidential 
data (ethical aspects). In the types of activities relative to the procedures, the 
analytical-­logical aspect specific to computing experts could be dominating, while 
in the DSS, where knowledge sharing is generalized within a widen community, we 
could incorporate more diversified aspects like ethical principles. We could evaluate 
the social and cultural aspects of a given design situation, reflect on its legal and 
physical aspects and observe the linguistics and communication behaviours. In the 
9  Toward a Discovery and Strategic Alignment Matrices for Socio-technical Systems’ Design

305
transdisciplinary approach of community informatics design, it is important to 
understand that the aspects cannot be modeled and understood as autonomous, 
abstract and independent modalities. It is important to consider that formal lan-
guages and science’s analytical perspectives are only an aspect, a modality of the 
world to socio-build and make evolve into complex interrelation complexes, within 
systems containing several transitional, emerging and dynamic systems.
9.6.2  A Proposal to Represent DSS Activities and Knowledge
We could use the study of aspects in relation with the requirements of community 
information systems from the linguistics modality that scans all aspects of social 
systems to model. For each aspect, conversational design and linguistics can pro-
vide a series of complementary dialogue modes encompassing their symbols that 
can any express potentially significant activity or knowledge within each aspect of 
a social system. In accordance with the approach we have adopted for a decade, we 
will discuss the aspects in terms of “worlds to build” or “meaning spheres” as 
Basden calls them (2000, 2002, 2006, 2008, 2010a, b) inspired by Dooyeweerd 
(1979, 1984) and Habermas.
For Dooyeweerd (1979, 1984), the aspects are meaning spheres and rules that 
allow any reality to be and to occur. The type of content we can extract from each 
aspect includes all what aspects validate in terms of reality production (or con-
science). The set of aspects validates or creates the following properties:
•	 The spheres are distinct modes of being (things, entities, elements, components, 
events, processes).
•	 The spheres are distinct types of property basis.
•	 The spheres are distinct types of rationality or inference.
•	 The spheres define distinct ways to link things and people’s communities.
•	 The spheres are distinct types of rules, laws, procedures or significant constraints.
•	 The spheres define distinct ways to function and act.
The worlds to build, the DSS and the socio-technical systems like the virtual 
communities command appropriate representations and modeling to the users’/
designers’ needs. The concrete proposition we formulate in the present section goes 
towards the sense of a multi-aspect representation that could be suitable for the 
modeling and design of DSS. It is not exhaustive nor definite, but it is an illustration 
of the community informatics approach that favours the “primitive aspectual multi-­
modality” useful to the representation of knowledge in evolutive systems (adapta-
tion of Dooyeweerd 1979, 1984; de Basden 2002, 2006, 2008, 2010a, b).
The following list’s goal is to present examples of aspects to take into account in 
the design of community information systems, instead of imposing a systematic 
model to follow. It suggests a series of primitive elements to validate for the poten-
tial integration of different meaning spheres in the users/designers’ everyday 
experience.

Chapter 10
The Fields and the Definition Taken into 
Account for the Construction 
of the Multimodal and Multi-aspect Discovery 
and Strategic Alignment Matrices (2MDSAM) 
for the DSS Design
From the reference framework described in the previous chapter and the whole enti-
ties defined as modalities or aspects to be taken into account in the DSS instantia-
tion and implantation, in this chapter, we present the definition of the multimodal 
and multi-aspect discovery and strategic alignment matrices (2MDSAM) for the 
DSS design. The 2MDSAM provides an operational reference framework to orga-
nize and model the elements in interaction and the dynamic DSS components as 
well as a way to describe the design process and activities. It seeks to fulfil the gaps 
of current modeling systems in information systems through the input of multiple 
disciplines and fields to the DSS modeling. The evolution of the Web in the past 
10 years took us from the design of information and communication systems dedi-
cated to content production and planning to digital social systems supporting com-
munity, family, organizational and social life at a large scale. Social sciences have 
remained quiet until now in front of this major phenomenon of the third millennium. 
In this chapter, we wish to fulfil this gap by suggesting a concrete representation and 
modeling tool while showing the potential for universal design (generic) centred on 
the human. The 2MDSAM operationalize the DSS conceptualization (its instantia-
tion) while facing the challenge of pushing back the framework limits existing in the 
design of organizations and DSS. It provides a way to organize the information on 
various modalities and several DSS aspects in order to facilitate the co-creation and 
cognition distributed for the development of better DSS.
10.1  Community Informatics Design Systems’ 
Conceptualization
We can visualize the 2MDSAM like a cross containing row entries and identical 
columns (Fig. 10.2). The diagonal represents the system’s components, and the cells 
other than the ones from that diagonal (off-diagonal cells) represent the relations 

314
between components. The cells on that diagonal represent a graph of a particular 
class of knots. Each knots class “is aligned with” one of the DSS fields. The block 
of cells from the diagonal represents the multimodal and multi-aspect relations that 
connect a diversity of knots classes.
The readers familiar with the IEEE standards could interpret the 2MDSAM as a 
collection of models referring to the totality of the digital social system. Each row 
or column in the 2MDSAM represents a “vision”, a point of view, a particular aspect 
and a series of concerns or questions related to the system being studied or under 
construction. In addition, the 2MDSAM lays the foundations for the “face-to-face” 
interactions between elements, which give the entire DSS a more systematic per-
spective founded on the theory.
The 2MDSAM is modeled according to an enriched data structure able to repre-
sent the social information and contents for community informatics design and the 
management of the digital social systems project. The 2MDSAM is both a hyper-
graph and a multigraph. A hypergraph contains various graphs that contain different 
classes of knots. There are interactions between the different types of knots (e.g. 
between the stakeholders and the infrastructures, between certain social aspects and 
socio-technologies). A multigraph may contain several types of cross checking or 
boundaries between knots. For example, two practice communities could possess 
reciprocal relations, like communications through socio-digital media and eco-
nomic links.
Each knot and each social system and sub-social system under development rela-
tion can be described as properties and attributes of these properties. For example, 
a property related to quantitative aspects can be described by an attribute (binary, 
abstract, scaling up, digital) or by a statistic function. Furthermore, the 2MDSAM 
allows to represent the temporal evolution of the social system (knots, relations, 
properties), in accordance to our adaptation of the “systems in transition state” 
theory.
The 2MDSAM data structure is made of seven classes of knots that correspond 
to seven fields connected to the DSS development: the exostructure, the endostruc-
ture, the design activity processes, the socio-communicational processes, the func-
tionalities, the socio-technologies and ethics. It is the modeling of a type of 
complexity architecture, according to Simon’s expression (1960, 1962), that repre-
sents an effort of entities definition to appreciate the wealth of its interrelations, in 
order to analyse the community information systems and the realization of creative 
DSS scenarios. Before presenting the discovery matrix, here is an attempt to synthe-
size and semi-formalize the present components. An entire work of fundamental 
and applied research must be performed to validate these operational definitions and 
to instantiate them in systems that would be more favourable for us. Let us examine 
the fields identified by our team within the APSI research.
10  The Fields and the Definition Taken into Account for the Construction…

315
10.1.1  The Exostructure (Exogenous Elements or 
Environment)
The exostructure encompasses the modeling of exogenous elements and their inter-
actions with the external context of DSS design; the identification of the DSS inter-
actions with its social, political, economic and cultural environment; the market 
modeling; the support and organizational and institutional support modeling; the 
societal; the partnership helix modeling; the evolutive criteria and sustainable devel-
opment modeling; as well as ethics principles.
10.1.2  The Endostructure (Endogenous Elements)
The endostructure brings together the elements that describe a series of properties 
specific to community informatics design while taking into account the relations 
between components in interaction in a DSS: the network structure, its infrastruc-
ture topology, the stakeholders, the identification and the negotiation of their roles, 
the procedures and constraints, the management and governance rules and the 
socio-communicational aspects (the 8C approach, the aspects philosophy, the quin-
tuple helix theory, the activity theory, the conversational design theory of various 
dialogue modes, the processes diagrammatic, etc.).
10.1.3  The Community Informatics Design Activities: Process, 
Collective Creation Mechanism and Sociocultural 
Design
The main global aspects of the community informatics design activities are: the type 
of social system to co-build; the philosophical modeling position according to 
themes and situations; the design process (design activity sequences, the life cycle, 
the phases, the tasks, the subtasks realized by the DSS or within it, the basic termi-
nology); the design context; the relations between aspects, properties and attributes; 
the relations between aspects and objects (especially between the resources level 
and the project’s objectives’ ambition level); time and the calendar; transitory states; 
the system’s boundaries to model or develop; design ethics; entities’ representation 
modes; an entity state; the description of the entity state; past and current DSS 
­properties; desirable properties; the design situation (a DSS state combination, the 
process state and the context state at a precise moment); the description of the 
design situation (the values of all properties); the scenarios; the alternatives; the 
determination of activities; tasks and subtasks to realize; transformations; muta-
tions; the design process objectives and the choice of elements to represent; model-
ing methodologies; and the design space and reality modes of representation (at a 
certain moment in time).
10.1  Community Informatics Design Systems’ Conceptualization

316
10.1.4  Socio-communicational Structure and Processes
The main socio-communicational aspects are: the social and organizational archi-
tecture; the analysis of the network sociometrics structures (made of people, peers 
networks, partner communities, stakeholders and organizations); people’s interests 
and needs in the DSS co-construction, workshops and dialogue; resources to inves-
tigate community informatics design activities, understand them and engage multi-
ple actors in network collaborative practices; the analysis of social networks; the 
participative architecture for user’s content generation and contributions manage-
ment; the participants’ identity and the participation mechanisms in various interac-
tion patterns; dialogue modes and their interaction (collateral commitment and 
resources sharing); pragmatic and cybersemiotics; communication dedicated to 
action and activity coordination and conflict management; the language action per-
spectives; “organizing” and “sense making”; the community informatics design 
consequences on the relations between people and partner users/designers and the 
evaluation of these consequences, communication values and principles; the proce-
dures; the research-action methodology, cultural intervention phases and reflexive 
practice; as well as the epistemology of design thinking and community informatics 
design thinking modes, virtual communities types and online collaborative net-
works platforms.
10.1.5  Functionalities
Functionalities encompass what the system does in relation to goals, objectives, 
reasons and the social DSS justification, motives of various actors, stakeholders and 
the DSS intentions. It is the functional incorporated architecture of the set of three 
architectures, especially through the identification of action verbs and DSS planned 
activities in order to combine tools, applications and services to validate and accom-
pany what the DSS wants to do (its intentions and objectives). For example, func-
tionalities at the content production and communication level consist of sharing, 
standardizing, diffusing and virtualizing processes, to unite resources and intranets 
with the help of Web research tools, RSS feeds, Atomz and folksonomy. At the col-
laboration level, it is about sharing; coordinating; managing; making collective 
decisions through blogs, wikis, social networks, platforms and instant communica-
tion systems like Skype; as well as developing its collective identity and collective 
efficiency, to stand out, to produce, to innovate and to co-create. At the applications 
accompanying workspaces level, functionalities seek to personalize, facilitate, visu-
alize, adapt work spaces according to professions, simplify life, draw, model, sche-
matize by composite apps and open and free suites. At the collaborative processes 
and the free services level, functionalities must make fluid, accompany, optimize, 
motivate to promote collaboration between actors (people, communities, organiza-
tions, partners, stakeholders), optimize the capture and collective information

317
visualization, train participants to the modeling and familiarize them with the 
instantiation and implantation processes of favourable solutions for the community 
or the organization, such as modeling applications like SMART or matrix naviga-
tors, or even decrease the administrative delays through the use of online simplified 
forms, contract types, self-service applications and creativity tools that are lower 
cost and user-friendly.
10.1.6  Socio-technologies
The main socio-technologies are the technological architecture and its norms, the 
physical aspects of the DSS infrastructure and components and non-human DSS 
elements, including the infrastructure, the interfaces design, the smart agents, the 
socio-digital functionalities and the commitment strategies of the participants ori-
ented towards social communication and collaboration. Socio-technologies contain 
a large part of the social and socio-communicational architecture, and they are 
incorporated into marketing, governance, optimization of numerous communica-
tion processes, public communication and public relations, design support through 
collaborative tools, artificial intelligence and smart agents, modeling, simulation, 
decision-making, investigations and participative research action.
In social sciences and in community informatics, the social architecture and 
socio-technologies refer more and more to the community informatics experts work 
that applies the analysis principles and social media design and information archi-
tecture (content generation, contact strategies, viral marketing, open externaliza-
tion, ubiquitous computing, social applications, business models and processes, 
knowledge economy, community development, communication for development, 
the user’s experience and the users/designers commitment). They now encompass 
the construction of platforms and digital environments, modeling and simulation of 
complex social processes, transmedia platforms and, in the present book, the DSS 
design assistance platform. The technologies, methodologies and various approaches 
of all nature are the ones seeking to introduce new aspects in the world, to change it 
or to improve it. Socio-technologies are the art and the science of making things 
happen in order to improve everyone’s quality of life.
10.1.7  Ethics
Community informatics design, in the way we address it in this book, refers to the 
fundamental orientations a collective of users/designers wants to offer to the evolu-
tion of its future social systems. Community informatics design ethics refer to the 
norms designers and multiple stakeholders decide to adopt to learn to live together 
and to make consequent collective decisions for the future rising generations. Ethics 
in the deep and more generic sense we can give consists of determining the 
10.1  Community Informatics Design Systems’ Conceptualization

318
sought-­after qualities of the final result according to the actors’ objectives and inten-
tions. For example, to understand the functionalities in relation to sustainable devel-
opment ethics criteria (self-realization, the respect of culture and identity, the 
learning of others, economic durability, economic feasibility, operational viability, 
institutional and social validation, the respect of the environment, the motivation of 
all generations or the inclusion of various social classes).
10.1.8  Community Informatics Design’s Activity System Time 
and Transition States
The seven DSS community informatics design components and their environment 
change through time and their development. The components (elements, entities, 
people, intentions and norms), their properties and their attributes can be modified: 
we add some, we remove some, and we modify their characteristics. A DSS con-
tains emerging properties that result in interactions between the social and socio-­
technological components. In Chap. 4, we have presented the CAPACITÉS model’s 
“flexibility” property; we implicitly tried to introduce this concept like an evolution 
degree measurement of a social system through time, as an emerging property of a 
socio-technical system that can be understood by examining social and technologi-
cal fields that jointly interact in a DSS to evaluate and measure a DSS’s flexibility; 
a community informatics expert must understand its changing sources, grasp the 
influence of new components on different parts and the whole and determine who is 
responsible of the implementation and management of these changes.
By getting inspired by the works of Isabelle Reymen et al. (2001, 2003, 2006), 
we have chosen to represent a community informatics design system by using the 
transition state systems. This complex system modeling theory inspires us because 
it has a general impact to take into account the similar design processes in the vari-
ous disciplines we have examined through our case studies and the document 
research realized within the APSI research (project life cycles, software engineering 
architectures, in building architecture, in technologies management and in partici-
pative research action in social sciences). We see here an interesting heuristic 
approach because it can help the realization of the seven modeling fields of the DSS 
community informatics design’s evolution and to socio-dynamically model an array 
of “design situations” (Reymen et al. 2001, 2003, 2006) and “design activities”. It 
helps define the imprecise but fundamental concept of “situational topology” by 
describing the interactions between spaces and time, infrastructures, behaviours and 
resources that intervene at various moments and various levels of analysis in sys-
tems modeling. It finally helps the operationalization of various transdisciplinary 
combinations to model DSS involving several specialities and professions.
In the state of transition systems theory, a state is defined as the situation at a 
given moment in time, a state modified by transitions. A community informatics 
design situation corresponds to a state; a community informatics design activity 
10  The Fields and the Definition Taken into Account for the Construction…

319
corresponds to a transition. Descriptive and normative modeling of large-scale com-
plex systems, we suggest in our book, uses the transitions state concept to describe 
the various design processes in a DSS discovery and strategic alignment matrices. 
Only observable users/designers behaviours are taken into account. Furthermore, 
only basic transition state systems concepts help us describe the users/designers 
behaviour. The mathematics aspect and the formal notation of these systems have 
not been retained for obvious reasons, linked to the impossibility of measuring the 
phenomena in the strict applied sciences sense and also facilitating the process com-
prehension by a more general audience of university professors and practitioners 
that are less keen about mathematics (which is our case and most of our students’ 
case as well). Let us finally note that the basic terminology of transition state sys-
tems modeling is extended to the terminology and the common use concepts in 
technical sciences and that we have used to describe the community informatics 
design seven fields of modeling as notions of representation, property, attributes of 
these properties, activities, structures, relations and processes (with several concep-
tual extensions and by analytical prolongation towards social sciences, even sci-
ences of the imprecise (Moles 1967, 1992).
10.1.9  System’s Boundaries
DSS have difficult boundaries to determine since they are built in networks that can 
expand to several levels of complexity in an “evolutive social geography” with 
sometimes imprecise origins. For our purposes, DSS design and for modeling needs, 
let us say that the boundaries are temporarily defined by components control that 
constitute the systems (in various fields) and by their strategic alignment with the 
system’s intentions (its current or anticipated functionalities). The DSS components 
make a unified whole that interacts with the environment (exostructure) as an open 
and evolutive systems oriented towards the improvement of various ecosystems.
Often, a socio-technical system like a DSS incorporates components that do not 
contribute to the system’s objective anymore and remain passive. Certain compo-
nents can even provoke the system’s inertia and weight constraints or require exag-
gerated procedures and rules. Others make it divert from its objectives. Because 
social systems are systems in permanent evolution, the system must adjust, adapt to 
face social pathologies (Yolle), dysfunctions and conflicts threatening it. Even if 
certain members of a DSS or a collaborative network are disagreeing on a procedure 
or certain elements of a project plan, the system will self-regulate or the facilitator/
designer will find a way to adjust the components by realigning them on the objec-
tive and the system’s intentions. We can think of the components replacement, their 
modification, the modification of policies or other modes of change adaptation. In 
certain cases, the omission to make these adjustments might lead to the system’s 
death. Mutations and transformations are the nature of living systems; like the DSS, 
we can consider like self-adaptive complex systems capable of recreating their own 
existence conditions.
10.1  Community Informatics Design Systems’ Conceptualization

320
10.1.10  Other Properties: Complexity Levels, Society Tiers 
and Their Relationships
The interdependence between parties and the components constitutes another prop-
erty of the socio-technical systems, therefore the DSS. The current state of a design, 
a system and a community informatics design system depends on the previous 
states. We may think the social construction of a DSS is the result of hundreds of 
decisions made throughout its development. The DSS depends on the choice of 
several types of knowledge and theoretical contributions, which changes our way of 
observing, analysing and evaluating these systems through time. Therefore, the 
comprehension efforts of human decisions, impromptu events and other types of 
information on behaviours require a deep knowledge of each of the seven fields.
As we have demonstrated in Chap. 8, socio-technical systems like DSS exist 
through various levels of complexity (see the CAPACITÉS model) and at various soci-
ety tiers while containing multiple entities and components in dynamic interaction. 
Figure 10.1 represents the characteristics of complex socio-technical systems accord-
ing to a space-time plan containing various technologies mediatized dynamic interac-
tions which favours evolution and social systems generativity, for better or for worse.
Even if our conceptualization of the DSS fields centralizes its attention on large-­
scale complex socio-technical systems, our basic socio-technical systems analysis 
and design model design DSS from different degrees of complexity, from the more 
technical to the softer one, from the infrastructure to the global social networks and 
from a simple individual interacting with an artefact for an intention or a need to the 
global collective networks capable of interacting with millions of people (LinkedIn, 
Facebook, Twitter). The infrastructure, architectures and structure of the socio-­
technical system set of components should reflect those of its social organization. 
This is why the CAPACITÉS schematic representation reflects various levels of 
social complexity, supported or accompanied by a physical and software infrastruc-
ture and by the appropriate analysis levels. The social field and the relations between 
partners or stakeholders have the priority on socio-technologies and help define the 
inferior complexity levels. It is difficult and even less desirable to trace well-defined 
limits between levels; it is not necessary to also have opaque boundaries between 
each of the seven modeling fields.

The main environmental components are the political, social, cultural, economic 
and technological factors that promote, force or modify the DSS characteristics. 
Each of these exogenous elements and contain properties and attributes that describe 
the characteristics of each of the components. For example, for the practitioner’s 
community of a hospital, the governance and regulation mechanisms, the city’s 
goods and services and the cost of electricity and science state of advancement con-
stitute environmental components.
Let us start by observing the interactions between exogenous elements and exog-
enous. It is sometimes important to analyse this type of interaction. For a hospital, 
it could be interaction between the fair medication price (exogenous component) 
and the help and the government grants (exogenous component), or the gap between 
government norms and policies guiding the medical acts and real practices of clini-
cian communities.
10.2.2  Stakeholders
The stakeholder’s matrix represents the social system, a large part of the DSS 
endostructure field, encompassing the relations between partners and the social 
appropriation of collaboration technologies. Stakeholders are the components 
(entities, elements, for a modeling abstract purpose) that contribute to the system’s 
objective and that control the various systems’ resources (the community) dispose 
of them. The influence of the network’s power of action, spatial extension or cyber-
space and the mastery of action landscape and various elements of the endostruc-
ture (organization, DSS, partnership contracts, collaborative network) represent 
the system’s boundaries. To identify the stakeholders of a DSS project, it is useful 
to ask the following questions: Who benefits from it? What are the concrete bene-
fits? Who finances the project? Who provides the 2.0, 3.0 or 4.0 media or collab-
orative platforms? Who loses? What are the constraints and norms in effect with 
each partner?
Interactions between stakeholders make the collaborative social network 
mediatized by technology. These multiple interrelations can be analysed and 
synthesized in different ways. In the setting of a health agency and its regional 
partners, for example, the analysis of social networks can facilitate the compre-
hension of interactions between a hospital and the various healthcare partners, 
for example, or between the departments and the associative communities of a 
region in order to organizational design of the care continuum, to verify the 
information relating to the best collaborative practices or to optimize the care 
efficiency for certain types of illness through the exchange of inter-professional 
expertise.

10.2.3  DSS Objectives
The objectives matrix represents a part of the functionalities field that defines the 
often complex combinatory between the various actors’ intentions and the general 
and specific objectives of the project. The objectives contain the explicit and implicit 
DSS needs and the communication requirements and conditions specific to each 
participating member (within or outside the institution or responsible organization). 
A hospital objective can be to create practice communities in metal health in order 
to improve daily patients monitoring. Properties and attributes can include quantifi-
able needs, performance indicators and analysis tools for social media’s perfor-
mance in the patient’s evaluation and monitoring, concerning the increase of family 
doctors according to the communities to serve, the number of emergency admis-
sions, the structuring degree of an ambulatory shift or the relief of an emergency 
regarding the level of collaboration of various partner communities.
The objectives × objectives interaction matrix allows the modeler or the com-
munity informatics expert to represent the interactions between various objectives. 
For example, if a hospital seeks to reduce its operating costs and optimize the qual-
ity of life of its personnel, there might be some enormous contradictions in the 
system. Likewise, if we wish to maximize contacts between patients while putting 
all the clinical actors in distant geographical networks, certain contradictions might 
occur. Or if we try to make certain practices transparent that could potentially harm 
the expertise exclusivity of certain doctors. Finally, the simultaneous desire to cut in 
all the healthcare services and increase the number of doctors in remote regions will 
create problems at the healthcare administration level.
The objectives × objectives interactions are essential to all complex projects 
because they reveal obvious important contradictions or paradoxes at the beginning 
and throughout DSS projects.
10.2.4  Functionalities
Functions (or functionalities) describe the actions the DSS performs to meet the 
objectives. Described by verbs in the community informatics design model, they are 
accomplished in priority by humans but also by smart machines (robots), collabora-
tive platforms and creativity tools. Each function must have a link or a relation with 
an objective or another function. Like in the APSI project, it was about creating 
instantiation norms to build a SADC; several functions of our DSS nominally seek 
to coordinate and create governance modes and respect ethics modes to maintain the 
trust and reputation. They may contain properties and attributes easily identifiable, 
measurable like socio-demographic or socio-professional information of the mem-
bers of a community (or even the list of components to instantiate by fields). They 
can also be connected to certain forms of DSS or favour certain particular aspects 
and attributes of a field. Each community informatics design socio-technology or 
10.2  Multimodal and Multi-aspect Discovery and Strategic Alignment Matrices…

324
activity is connected to a particular form of DSS to co-build, hence the importance 
to link the functionalities to the fields of activity (see our DSS typology essay in 
Chap. 6).
The ethical or cultural aspects are sometimes more difficult to seize, but these 
heuristic methods very well serve to apprehend them qualitatively, even if we need 
to equip them with a more systematic evaluation measure later on. For example, 
how can we guarantee the security of all patients’ electronic files in a hospital? 
What tools or platforms can meet the users of a hospital website trust needs and 
security? What types of mobile applications can satisfy the physiotherapists acting 
in emergencies at the level of any administrative region while accessing the infor-
mation contained in the patients’ files? What information, communication and col-
laboration tools can accompany knowledge sharing (functionalities) in a virtual 
community tribe of diabetics with international ramifications? In a hospital, func-
tionalities related to the personnel and patients training or to the collaboration 
between community organizations and the hospital professional services could be 
retained for more general functionality purposes of the healthcare services’ 
coordination.
As for the functionalities × functionalities interactions, our group has identified 
various types of functionalities between different functions associated with the 
­creation of a DSS, for example, the respective knowledge of the members of a 
healthcare community and the necessity to share certain knowledge, discuss and 
talk about the healthcare service planning, simulate costs and its specific gover-
nance modes and debate the ethics factors to consider and the service modeling 
procedures and needs. There can be various types of more abstract social relations 
to consider (socio-communicational aspects). For example, the type of network 
according to existing hierarchies, relations between services (between human 
resources and the members training formation). In fact, we can deconstruct social 
relations into sub-functions like extra training units, actors collaboration in diverse 
sub-tasks, emergency services to improve users’ well-being, information services to 
create and social networks to promote.
10.2.5  Socio-technologies (Technological Architectures 
and Collaborative Tools)
Socio-technologies’ matrix brings into play the platforms’ physical infrastructure 
components, software tools and collaborative technologies for design support. It is 
also the field of study that observes social media associated with the analysis, 
research, research action and R-D relative to the improvement of computer-­
mediatized social participation technologies, in all sorts of fields and for all sorts of 
activities, in practice or innovation communities. These components are destined to 
create technological infrastructures and non-human physical entities that support 
10  The Fields and the Definition Taken into Account for the Construction…

325
design and research for the benefit of stakeholders, users/designers of civil society, 
universities, enterprises and organizations, the government and its agencies.
Socio-technologies’ matrix supports the efforts of one or several practices, vir-
tual or not, communities in the realization of their objectives according to the func-
tionalities identified by the team in charge and the stakeholders. For the APSI 
project, the Colab infrastructure has been hosted at the UQAM’s Sciences Pavillon 
by our colleagues Guy Gendron and Abderraman Ourahou. The platform choice 
(infrastructure) was the latest version of the Joomla! platform, from a series of cri-
teria elaborated in a previous project funded by our partner Clarica/Sun Life through 
the researches we were conducting at Hexagram/UQAM (a research and art cre-
ation and media technologies centre based in Montreal), we have been members for 
12 years and where we have developed the virtual communities design and socio-­
technical systems foundations. The ACIL houses educational software and tools for 
cyber learning in the spirit of digital literacy. The multi-criteria analysis chart guid-
ing the choice of a platform will be presented later.
Socio-technologies × socio-technologies interactions, interactions between vari-
ous types of technological objects, like infrastructures, the material and software, 
social media and creativity tools (modeling, simulation, visualization), have been 
the object of an important reflection the present book wants to acknowledge. Instead 
of adopting a classical techno-centred approach or reject it completely, the entire 
reflection about technological structures was made around socio-technical systems 
in order to find an instantiation method focused on the human that could take into 
account the various types of architectures, like the technological systems and the 
organizational architectures (technologies management approaches and institu-
tional governance, enterprise architectures and organizational design) to which we 
have added an important analysis and design perspective we call “social and partici-
pative architectures” (closer to the social science theories and methodologies and 
participative research action our researchers were more familiar with).
Therefore, the interaction between diverse technological components cannot 
ignore the human-machine interfaces that are at the heart of the mediation and 
media coverage of collaborative social links. The socio-technologies × socio-­
technologies interaction is distancing itself from the pure machine × machine or 
infrastructure × infrastructure interaction, even if it necessarily keeps several aspects 
form it since infrastructures modeling accompanies the more abstract interactions 
promoted by platforms and social media. We focused our attention on problems like 
applications compatibility, systems interoperability between stakeholders, social 
appropriation of applications destined to the evolution of the community depending 
on the professions, the mastery of tools by professionals and clinicians, training 
needs and the cost of licences acquisition regarding open-source code software. In 
healthcare, for example, the evaluation of existing platforms of each of the partners 
according to professional activities and skills of various departments is an unavoid-
able socio-technical issue. We will give an example of the alignment matrix between 
objectives, functionalities and the social Web 2.0 tools.

10.2.6  Community Informatics Design Activities  
(As an Evolutive Process)
10.2.6.1  What Is a Design Situation?
The activities, as defined by Engeström’s activity theory (1987, 1999), associated 
with community informatics design represent the dynamic field of analysis and the 
implementation of socio-communicational processes according to two models:
	1.	 A descriptive model of the generic activity, based on the activity theory, serving 
to identify the best design activity model for a specific field ecosystem or a spe-
cific form of DSS (e.g. a business platform or an enterprise collaborative net-
work). This model also helps describe the DSS in terms of media and collaborative 
tools, individual and community intention, the distribution and coordination of 
work, tasks and sub-tasks to perform, norms, procedures to respect and expected 
results as well as contradictions between socio-communicational processes and 
within each of them.
	2.	 A normative model (Reymen 2001) seeking to accompany users/designers and 
community informatics experts thanks to a reflexive structure on the design 
­process that contains seven phases of an iterative and open life cycle made of the 
following generic elements:
•	 A design situation that contains the DSS to be co-created, because they do not 
yet exist, the properties and attributes of the DSS influencing the design pro-
cess, for example, the seven phases of community informatics design that 
could be increased, decreased or modified depending on the case (the number 
of phases of the life cycle potentially creating different tasks and sub-tasks), 
depending on a more or less finished suite of steps or sequences of activities 
to be realized, as well as factors describing the exostructure and the endo-
structure influences (or socio-communicational processes) on design activi-
ties (properties and attributes of various aspects of objects, products, 
applications and services of the DSS that can evolve during its construction 
and the dependent factors of the people or community determining them).
•	 The relations in community informatics design that unite properties and fac-
tors (limiting or rewarding) and express the influence of a property, an attri-
bute or a factor on another property in a given design situation. For example, 
the relations in a practice community in hospitals could be of hierarchical, 
heterarchical or lateral; causal relations could be the object of hypothesis; we 
could also discover dependence or interdependence relations by analysing 
certain types of behaviours or conducts, appropriate or not, ethical or not. 
Relations could also be noted between the tools, the requirements and the 
needs of people, for example, telepresence workshops regarding social media 
and video-conferencing tools available in various patient communities, tools 
limiting or enhancing the workshops.
10  The Fields and the Definition Taken into Account for the Construction…

327
•	 The representation of an entity (components and elements), that is, the DSS 
undergoing modeling and design, a design process like the community infor-
matics design seven phases spiral is the reproduction of a series of properties, 
attributes and factors of this entity in a mental image, an enriched image, a 
drawing, a collective representation model, a theoretical model, a graph, a 
diagram, a visualization or a 2D or 3D model, a prototype or a discovery or 
alignment matrix. For example, we could visualize the co-design activity pro-
cess of doctors and nurses in a department, represent the members of a net-
work with drawings and diagrams, describe the dialogue modes or 
conversational design according to certain functionalities to be created and 
make the enriched image of a DSS practice community project with all its 
components. The representation of a software can be its open-source code or 
an information flow diagram. Different representations of a same entity or 
technological object can be suggested and found in various sections of a digi-
tal library or a design assistance website. The cognitive or mental representa-
tions of various actors can be different on several aspects. The design 
intentions can be represented according to a variety of thinking modes, lan-
guage types (formal or informal) and dialogue or animation modes. 
Representation modes can be aligned, contradict, oppose and complete 
themselves.
•	 The state of an entity, or the series of values, identified for all properties and 
factors that influence this entity (related to the DSS or the community infor-
matics design process) at a certain given moment in time. The state of an 
entity can also be considered, in Dooyeweerd’s aspects definition (1984), like 
a specific property of this entity. It also describes a particular portrait of this 
identity according to the project’s state of advancement or DSS maturation. 
Its value is represented by a series of values.
•	 The description of the state of an entity, or a specific representation of a sub-­
series of values (monetary, ethics, cultural) of the state of the entity, based on 
the general terminology of state transition systems. A state description by the 
concepts text must be put to contributions. Therefore, to represent dynamic 
phenomena, concepts can be represented by images, videos, animations and 
various types of diagrams.
•	 Current properties of a social system of a design process at a certain moment 
in time.
•	 Desirable properties related to intentions and objectives of the community or 
the community informatics expert. Current properties are determined or influ-
enced by the users/designers community (eventually based on expert design-
ers experts’ opinions) and by the design context. Users/designers can identify 
the desirable properties but factors related to the exostructure or emerging 
factor scan also be determining for the design elements articulation. The 
desirable properties rely on questions and concepts generally used in various 
design professions, such as needs, constraints, procedures, conditions, speci-
fication, modeling and instantiation.
10.2  Multimodal and Multi-aspect Discovery and Strategic Alignment Matrices…

328
•	 The current state of the DSS under design or under a community informatics 
design process is a series of values for all current properties.
•	 The desirable state of a DSS under construction or under a community infor-
matics design process, represented by different series of values for all desir-
able properties.
From these definitions, we will admit that a design situation, at a precise moment, 
can be defined as a combination of the state of advancement of the DSS being 
designed, the community informatics design process state and the state of the design 
context at this moment. According to Reymen et al., this means the design situation 
includes:
	1.	 The series of values of all properties of the different aspects describing the DSS 
under construction
	2.	 The series of values of all properties serving to describe the design process
	3.	 The series of values of all factors influencing the DSS being designed and its 
community informatics design process
This means that during the design process, community informatics experts build 
the representations of the DSS to co-build, the design process (inspired by the life 
cycle and classical design phases or by developing their own imaginative model) 
and the design context. The representation fabrication entails the modeling of ­reality 
from a particular point of view, by neglecting certain non-relevant aspects while 
validating others. Therefore, we will define the description of a community infor-
matics design situation like the specific representation of relevant aspects’ subcate-
gories, the series of values and the series of all properties serving to describe the 
DSS being co-designed as well as the design process and the series of values influ-
encing the DSS under co-construction and its community informatics design pro-
cess. The description of a design situation is greatly improved by using entities’ 
discovery and strategic alignment matrices (components, elements, communication 
phenomena) that allow to identify and describe the relations between the aspects 
properties and the DSS characteristics and the factors involved in the design 
situation.
Reymen’s team and co-researchers suggest a way to make a difference between 
an entity, its representation, the state of an entity and the state of the description of 
this entity. Therefore, an entity exists in the realty (its aspects and its aspects’ prop-
erties). Just like Reymen, we have chosen to model our entities (component s and 
reality elements) through the state concept (more relevant than the static entity con-
cept) by including the values concept (and attributes) for properties and factors; a 
state is an “objective” because it is defined by the users/designers (e.g. a subjectivity 
shared in a distributed cognition). An entity can be represented in various ways 
(texts, diagrams, information flows, photos, video, animations). The representation 
of an entity is realized by a person, a community or an intelligent agent, according 
to a limited list of properties and factors. We do not insist on the values and proper-
ties in mathematical terms because they pose problems to large segments of the 
population. Large-scale design for all can today take advantage of several modeling 
10  The Fields and the Definition Taken into Account for the Construction…

329
tools combining texts and graphic elements, but where the entire computational 
aspect has been “algorithmed” in user-friendly software for a wide community of 
users.
In the community informatics design process supported by discovery and strate-
gic alignment matrices and containing several types of aspects, properties and 
states, the concept of “interactive scenario” becomes important. The values of a 
certain property contain “relations” (e.g. costs regarding the resources to mobilize 
for a project) that can lead to a scenario or several possible scenarios when we anal-
yse various types of aspects, properties and values combinations linked to each of 
the scenarios. For each possible scenario, the various properties of an entity can be 
more or less important. These scenarios can emerge in current design properties or 
in desirable properties.
10.2.6.2  What Is a Design Activity?
A community informatics design situation can be transformed into another design 
situation by one or several actions. Users/designers can change the current state of 
a DSS under development as well as the design process and its activities. Stakeholders 
can also change the design context. Let us remind that stakeholders are actors or 
partners that have an interest in a DSS products, applications or services. ­Users/
consumers, users/designers in civil society, elected in charge of governance, admin-
istrators planning innovation policies and production or logistics managers can 
make the decisions at various stages of the development time continuum. The design 
context can also be modified by certain interactions between community informat-
ics experts and stakeholders.
We call “transformation” an action oriented towards a goal. An action put in 
place without an explicit goal is a “mutation”; this happens spontaneously, without 
any intervention of the human conscience. This distinction is important in order to 
avoid language abuse and fakes. Therefore, a design activity is a transformation 
according to a design objective at a given moment and space, initiated by a user/
designer or a community informatics expert that provokes a state transition of the 
DSS under construction or under the design process. For example, for the construc-
tion, in a hospital, of a virtual campus that adds to the traditional training given by 
the human resources direction (the type of university offering computer training), 
the implementation of a new training course like the one of Moira Allen’ socio-­
constructivist healthcare approach and the implantation of a collaborative learning 
community will constitute a design activity. The change is triple since three new 
properties are added to the system in place. In fact, we go from:
	1.	 A linear knowledge diffusion system (computer training) to a learning system by 
project
	2.	 A bank of courses to teach to collaborative design activities by social learning
10.2  Multimodal and Multi-aspect Discovery and Strategic Alignment Matrices…

330
	3.	 A group of users in individual training to a learning community by collaborative 
project (a new knowledge sharing mode, by socio-constructivist exercises in a 
learner community)
Transitions in the design context are described by transformations. Unplanned 
and emerging changes that occur during the deployment of the new solution are 
described as mutations. Community informatics experts and users designer of a 
virtual community of a DSS can modify the properties of the DSS under design and 
the community informatics design process (life cycle, phases, improvisation of 
actions to implement, occasional adaptations). The current properties and the 
desired properties can be modified, and other scenarios can be suggested. These 
could be articulated as prototypes to be experimented, social media to be configured 
on the hospital virtual campus platform, or simply a new concept to try according to 
a design objective and the functionalities related to it.
These new experimentations are helping to take calculated risks. Unheard prop-
erties emerge from new inputs or new knowledge brought in the DSS or the design 
process. Existing properties can be deconstructed into several sub-properties. The 
acts and actions seeking to modify the DSS state or the ongoing design process are 
translated by a new under design DSS representation or by design process modifica-
tions containing properties changes or new factors influencing the DSS structure or 
the design process. We can also modify the design process, its life cycle, its stages 
and tasks and sub-task sequences by carrying out changes on the entire process or 
at the level of certain specific sub-processes.
The production of a representation means either the creation or the co-creation of 
a new representation or the modification of an existing representation. For example, 
going from a conceptual mapping and the semantics network relying on the theory 
to a representation of living knowledge of the nursing personnel by the representa-
tion of objects, actions and people that Moira Allen’s approach entails, it represents 
a transition between two types of representation. The transition of experts’ theoreti-
cal concepts to the co-creation in conceptual maps teams, taking into account the 
real nursing personnel’s practices, shows another transition, a radical one, in the 
way of seizing and sharing knowledge in order to produce more interactive online 
training scenarios and more iterative mock-ups.
The objective of a design activity is to create, with the help of Engeström’s activ-
ity theory (1999) and his triangle “representing” an activity system at a moment in 
time, a modeling of the current social system (or the ecosystem), in other words, to 
create a representation of the desirable DSS state according to the desirable objec-
tives we had set. The DSS under design must respect the desired DSS properties 
conditions, and the DSS representations must respect the desired properties for a 
given representation. In this spirit, the representation must respect the requirements 
of a representation media (a written description, the transcription of a dialogue, a 
photo, a 3D modeling, a video presentation, a schematization, an animation with or 
without a text) as well as the stakeholders’ needs, depending on the utilities or the 
general costs related to a solution or a given scenario.
10  The Fields and the Definition Taken into Account for the Construction…

331
Often, the final goal of a design activity is not explicit. For example, it could 
mean to make the desired use of a website research tools more convivial. For the 
DSS desired state, functionalities × collaborative research tools mock-ups could be 
produced as double-entry discovery matrices where information research systems’ 
convivial properties, like learning time, cognitive costs and tool appropriation 
efforts, would be defined by values or arbitrary or symbolic measures, thus translat-
ing more or less accurately their conviviality degree. The representation could con-
tain text, symbolic equations and transactional video scenarios on the Internet 
allowing to determine the level of tools’ ease of use and to help the design of poten-
tial replacement scenarios.
10.2.6.3  A Descriptive Design Process
In accordance with the semiformal approach we have adopted throughout the pres-
ent book, we do not define the design process like a formal programming and plan-
ning algorithm, what would be contrary to community informatics creativity and 
imagination. Nor do we define it as a completely informal system where we would 
have a total creativity freedom. In the first case, it is a more closed-up process, con-
taining well-defined stages. In the second one, it is about the emergence, even 
improvisation, without the capacity to seize all the interaction and design patterns, 
an operation made impossible by the lack of traces. Furthermore, this second 
approach is not really interesting for us, because the lack of stages or of a scaffold-
ing of semi-open or semiformal sequences would prevent us from carrying out 
approaches that are specific to the grounded theory, for example, by learning from 
the ground experience or by feedback and a process evaluation (lack of process). 
The heuristic does not mean an unbridled creativity but a discovery and imagination 
process characterized by a semiformal approach and catalysed by animation and 
well-identified governance mechanisms.
Without coming back to the definition and design theories addressed in the first 
part of the book, with modeling in mind, let us remind that we can consider the 
design process like a more or less finished sequence (because sometimes it ends in 
the project’s computing section) of design activities necessary to meet a need, a 
result fulfil an intention or meet an objective. Theories, research process, quantita-
tive or qualitative methods, collaborative tools and platforms, DSS time spaces and 
their various arrangements, the three levels of skills and digital literacy are all exam-
ples of design situations.
A designer, a community informatics expert or an important collective of users/
designers can perform design activities according to more or less linear sequences, 
iterative circular processes or more or less parallel applications incorporated during 
a phase of designs consolidation. In fact, the community informatics design process, 
as collaborative and participative design, can be realized by various teams and in 
different time spaces. The change objects, aspects and subjects sometimes com-
mand a different co-design life cycle from one community to another. The design 
process properties can also be different from one team to another and act on the

332
causes of these changes, which could modify the activity sequence and the tasks to 
realize.
During the entire community informatics design process, community informatics 
experts can focus in turn on the under design DSS, on the design process (in seven, 
eight or nine phases or depending on the various aspects to model), on the design 
context or on the current and desired design properties. Series of properties and values 
(e.g. various modes of co-creation) can be added, deleted or modified according to 
new experiences, the context evolution or the collective maturation of an issue. The 
development and evaluation of design propositions or alternative scenarios constitute 
ways to realize social learning or experiences during a design process. In fact, it is a 
highly creative process that entails a “sociological imagination”, the exploration of 
new knowledge worlds with open data and prospective efforts in the research of future 
development solutions based on new goals and best practices outcomes (Fig. 10.3).
The goal of a design process is to create one or several under design DSS repre-
sentations, giving an ideal image of its properties, and its future desirable state, like 
discovery and exploration matrices, can allow us to do so. The DSS must also meet 
the members and the stakeholders’ needs in terms of desirable design process prop-
erties. Often, the goal of a design process entails its desired properties (e.g. the 
alignment of goals with certain functionalities). These desired properties can be 
formulated at the level of the final design process state (like the budget and the proj-
ect completion) or focus on the process state during the design (like the schematiza-
tion of certain design process states, the adoption of a certain type of modeling

matrix, the appropriation of a software tool to manage the projects or visualization, 
the planning of various types of presentation or workshops seeking to present stages 
reports and intermediate results, instructions for the documentation or bibliography 
or the creation of a glossary). The design goal can then be formulated and articu-
lated as a product co-creation, a task or a specific application during a particular 
process (choosing a decision-making for remote teams’ works). The design goals 
are then jointly defined by stakeholders and users/designers, usually with the help 
of a community informatics expert or a computing designer whose skills allow con-
figuration and the integration of any software applications at all level. Users/design-
ers and computing experts collaborate to define the properties of the DSS to build; 
they have the power to determine the desired representations with the technical 
advice of computing experts.
Let us remind that the current and desired properties, as they are modeled with 
discovery and exploration matrices, can be added, modified and deleted during the 
entire DSS co-creation process. It is both a natural evolutive change process and an 
intentional cultural process. In the evolutive systems theory like in the social sys-
tems one, the simultaneous evolution of current properties and desired properties 
are called “co-evolution”. We can then create in a community of practice one or 
several representations of a system (e.g. for the UQAM’s Colab, we started from a 
schematic representation of the system’s global architecture by text zones and 
arrows to get to present the various versions of the portal’s architecture as a table of 
contents that describes the portal structure in a linear way, Chap. 6). We could res-
cue these modules in the modules in a table of contents’ tree view (“home page”, 
various sections like “projects”, “members”, “tutorials”, “collaborative tools”) and 
present them as text to later transform them into more educational synthetic texts 
succinctly describing modules that can be incorporated into an action plan to repre-
sent the design steps and facilitate programming and Web planning.
A design task at a certain moment is a task that aims at the design goals at this 
moment of the development, starting with the current design situation. One or sev-
eral users/designers, sometimes scattered in various stakeholders, perform a task by 
carrying out design activities. Another way to express this design task concept is to 
say that it is made of a series of actions seeking to transform the current state of the 
DSS being co-designed or the characteristics and properties of the community 
informatics design process by taking into account the context elements at the micro-, 
meso- and macrosocial level. This evolution at the tasks level is often related to the 
design process goals, which, at the beginning of the project, are often vague and 
intangible. Certain constraints or procedures associated with design activities force 
the users/designers and the community informatics experts to modify their strategy, 
to plan differently their creation processes and refine their goals and objectives. The 
end of the co-design process (according to the design maturity criteria determined 
by a team) occurs when the state of the under design DSS and its multiple represen-
tations (properties, attributes, instantiation modes) aligns with the design project 
goals. In the daily practice, let us remind that tasks are not always well explained.
A community informatics design task can be made of several sub-tasks when the 
discovery and strategic alignment matrices reveal its properties in a more precise

way or an appropriate questioning on the ways to proceed, in relation to the DSS 
objectives, show the usefulness. A sub-task at a certain moment is a task that simply 
seeks to reach the design objectives at a precise moment in the DSS development. 
For example, it could be about creating a collective under-construction DSS repre-
sentation at a certain level of detail or analysis or at a certain society tier, by focus-
ing on certain DSS co-design aspects at a precise moment of the community 
informatics design life-cycle process. For example, during phase 1 of the design’s 
seven-phase life cycle, a community could decide to create a list of useful concepts 
for the design of a certain form of DSS under design and agree to divide this opera-
tion into sub-tasks mediatized by a wiki, by distributing it to the team in charge and 
the network partners in order to reduce the burden of defining the terms related to 
the entire task and, therefore, improve the concepts comprehension connected to the 
study of the design situation and the co-design process. Also, we could decide to 
adopt a specific dialogue mode, to use this communication mode for the implemen-
tation of design workshops and organizational coordination sub-tasks for various 
members or teams.
The evolution of properties, representations and positive or negative feedback on 
design activities can influence the design objectives. At the end of a DSS process, 
new sub-tasks (e.g. theoretical concepts to define by the grounded theory technique) 
require other new modeling and modification sub-tasks leading to a renewed design 
process. This is what happened to our team, during the APSI project, when the 
examination of our reference architectures properties like TOGAF, ARCON, 
Zachman framework and CoSpaces empirically convinced us of the necessity to add 
two additional phases to the life cycle seven original ones, and furthermore, these 
phases could be replaced by “metamorphosis”, a phase when an important transi-
tion forces the team to adopt a wide array of the DSS properties or representations, 
or, also, by a dissolution phase when, on an ad hoc basis, a virtual practice commu-
nity must stop its works or dissolve the team or simply because we have reached the 
end of a funded research project.
The execution of a sub-task creation can be the work of a manager in charge of 
collaboration, the facilitator of a practice community or the director in chief of 
knowledge management. Carrying out sub-tasks is articulated around several fac-
tors, a certain duration in time, the team composition and its various professions and 
transdisciplinary expertise, the DSS and form DSS favoured by the team and the 
operational objectives, social media and collaborative tools available or really mas-
tered by the team’s members and the stakeholders’ respective responsibilities. Work 
distribution and general sub-task coordination related to the community informatics 
design seven spaces and their scheduling in precise sub-tasks can be considered as 
a strategic design activity, with a verification list of entities (elements and compo-
nent) established from Engeström’s activity theory triangle (1999) modeled through 
the stakeholders discovery and strategic alignment matrices and social networks, 
objectives and properties matrices and social media matrices and functionalities).
Each design task at each life-cycle stage, for each type of architecture (techno-
logical, organizational, social) identified in our DSS model, has a specific design 
context; each design context is in turn defined in connection with a specific design

context. Users/designers and community informatics experts performing a design 
task and afferent sub-tasks can interact with other stakeholders, other professions 
and specialists of various disciplines involved in the projects. According to a spe-
cific design context, they can exchange different types of social information (Jaffelin 
1991, 1995; Harvey 2005, 2006a, b, 2008), from various modes of computer-medi-
atized communication and social participation devices. Namely, they can share 
knowledge regarding the under-construction DSS desired properties, refine the 
design process properties with the help of concepts expressed in this chapter, pre-
cise and validate the desire properties, evaluate the values of different factors like in 
the social appropriation of various collaborative modeling tools. They can also 
influence and modulate these factors by various dialogue modes (Banathy and 
Jenlink 2005; Christakis and Bausch 2006; Judge 2008a, b) and coordinate their 
negotiation/deliberation on global and local solutions to add to the various types of 
issues and challenges related to DSS design/implantation.
A “design space” or a “co-design exploratory space”, at a precise moment, is a 
design activity space that contains the current state of the social system to transform 
as well as a series of all possible states directed towards a goal and motivated by the 
under-construction DSS design intentions and its articulation, its feedback and its 
potential effect on the ongoing design process. The design space in the various com-
munity informatics is modeled like the global architecture of a design system repre-
sented by the community informatics design’s seven spaces with entities that are 
evaluated by the community informatics design analysis matrix and by the “design 
space concept”, matrix which contains the modeled design process entities in the 
present section and the questions and programs in the following sections. The first 
one indicates the types of design that occur in an experts’ practice community or 
non-initiated and their state at a given moment of the DSS development. The second 
one helps us identify all the future desired states by people in charge and stakehold-
ers with the help of a design process.
We will see that the global architecture schematized by the seven spaces allows 
to collectively generate analysis of use and the types of design to adopt to accom-
pany and model the future desirable or desired states according to the three main 
types of community informatics architecture: technological, organizational and 
social. These future states of architectures as well as the identification of their prop-
erties and their values are channelled in the current design state, for input activities, 
removal or modifications of properties and values related to them. The states of the 
environment and the design context belong only partially or indirectly to the design 
space, because designers of any level and expertise have no real influence on them, 
unless the DSS has the explicit goal of influencing the environment (the exostruc-
ture) and the design context with a particular attention to social architectures (e.g. by 
the animation and the large-scale cultural or socio-political intervention strategies).
The design space concept as defined by Elizabeth B.-N.  Sanders and Bo 
Westerlund (2011) is useful for the comprehension of the design act and tasks 
related to it and for the reflection in the action (Schön 1983), intervening in design 
activities (Engeström 1999). With the multiplication of collaborative design prac-
tices and partnerships involving more and more the non-specialist designers’ contri-

336
bution (Preece and Shneiderman 2008, 2009), our researches lead us to consider the 
co-design space concept and the community informatics design exploratory space 
as more precise than the traditional design space done on the drawing table or on a 
microcomputer of a single designer. Taking into account the social media growth, 
the citizen science rapid evolution, like in the fab labs and the living labs concepts, 
society becomes a sort of innovation co-laboratory where players are not defined 
ahead of time nor once and for all. To the contrary, community informatics imagina-
tion plays a great role because our models have a hard time adapting to all these 
changes.
In this spirit, the co-design or community informatics design space differs from 
the traditional “design space”, because it can be conceptually and practically located 
(Hutchins 2000, 2010) at the very beginning of the design process (pre-design or 
pre-planning of sub-space 1, “Explore”) which relies on the collective creativity of 
designers working together with non-specialist designers communities. They nego-
tiate and deal very complex issues like social change, organizational transforma-
tions and the DSS co-creation through various dialogue modes. They empathize the 
importance of products, services and applications instantiation, in fields more and 
more immaterial like social action and practices and social systems design. From 
there, emerges the need to evaluate a “design space” in terms of change or transi-
tion, not only at the level of its properties but also at the best practices level of the 
design process of future desirable states.
Our researches on action verbs in community informatics and in community 
informatics design, as revealed in our various case studies and two questionnaires, 
show that an analytical framework based on the notion of an evolutive community 
informatics design exploratory space in transition state can substantially improve 
our comprehension of users’ needs by experiencing, exploring and experimenting 
in, by and through the moments illustrated by community informatics design seven 
spaces, the DSS design to its instantiation in a portal open to change.
Community informatics design is a transformation activity of the existing social 
system or DSS’s current state serving to validate an existing community or to create 
new institutions and to “digitalize” them as communities or virtual organizations 
through a communication reframing of the design process oriented by the DSS 
objectives. To practise their profession and their skills, community informatics 
designer, new essential figures in the computational social sciences, root their prac-
tices in the design situation at a precise moment and perform their various tasks and 
sub-tasks to achieve the design objectives. The interaction modeling task between 
expert designers, users/designers, stakeholders and peer networks in the design con-
text is a complex task made necessary so that all DSS co-creation participants are 
informed of the representations by all members and ontologies of other partners, in 
order to debate important factors of the design context and to deliberate on the influ-
ences of important DSS characteristics and properties as well as on the adoption and 
negotiation of design processes and activities to favour. Sometimes, these discus-
sions bring practice communities to modify the design goals, just like a context 
change can occur because of unexpected exogenous factors influencing the design 
objectives in a completely different way than the objectives formulated by the 
partners.

By developing a community informatics design model process, our team has 
defined concepts and terms as parts of reality (entities, components, elements, prop-
erties of these elements, values of these elements studied by the philosophy of sci-
ences) and others as representations of reality (signs, discourse symbols, meaning 
studied by semantics and semiotics). In the table of the following page, our concepts 
are presented in the left column and channelled in a matrix that, row by row, pres-
ents the general questions we can formulate in a communication research context.
10.3  A Normative Design Process Guiding the Critical Thinking
We can define the reflection upon the community informatics design process like a 
critical thinking process structured around the community informatics design seven 
spaces, according to a descriptive model developed in Sect. 5.6. The normative 
community informatics design model is only summarily elaborated here for explor-
atory matrix modeling process purposes. The detailed seven spaces instantiation 
process has been presented in the previous section. In Chap. 7, we presented a list 
of concepts based on this operational strategy that could be supported by discovery 
and strategic alignment matrices. In Chap. 8, we presented a list of terms aligned on 
the example of the adaptation of a life cycle supported by the seven spaces generic 
methodology. Supported in this task by our colleagues Marie Kettlie André and 
Hassane Beidou, we will present a fictitious instantiation and modeling strategy that 
relies on the theoretical definitions of the community informatics instantiation and 
modeling and on the list of terms defined and presented in the last two chapters, 
especially within the aspects theory framework and the transition state’s systems 
theory. The concepts focused on critical thinking rely more specifically on the 
descriptive model terminology.
Let us note that we try to identify and define all the concepts of the study well. If 
this model can eventually throw off certain researchers who are not familiar with 
several of our concepts, they at least are accompanied by references and the research 
teams’ mention that created them, often by relying on numerous transdisciplinary 
researches. We simply wish to put a little rationality where certain researchers only 
see improvisation, emergence, unbridled creativity and artistic freedom. Science rises 
more from rigor than from debonair behaviours. In addition, an online glossary will 
eventually accompany our definitions (Harvey’s online site 2018), which represents 
another effort towards the inter-comprehension between disciplines and professions.
10.3.1  Community Informatics Design Reflection Process
The main descriptive model concepts presented in Sect. 5.6 are the design situation 
and the design activities. Community informatics experts start from a design situa-
tion in space 1 of the design spiral at certain moment. We define the “design process 
10.3  A Normative Design Process Guiding the Critical Thinking

338
reflection” like an activity seeking the critical examination of designers’ percep-
tions on the collaborative design situation and on what they cognitively master from 
the design activities. This process is done through various philosophical design 
thinking modes (as seen in Chap. 3) that offer a reflection basis to systematically 
consider the ways a community informatics expert guide himself on certain princi-
ples, of which he analyses, interprets and develops a thinking oriented by a goal and 
intentions, and all these acts (once again channelled in the verbs) are articulated 
together. We will come back to it further along in this chapter. The design process 
reflection will be defined than as a combination of “reflexive thinking mode on the 
design situation” and the reflection about design activities retained or memorized in 
a data base.
The design situation gives a static base to the design process, while the design 
activities give a dynamic perspective of the process. The analysis of discourses and 
representation modes on the design situation brings to light the following elements:
	1.	 The difference perceived between the current situation and the desired properties 
of the future DSS to develop must be known in order to verify if all the important 
aspects to model and instantiate are taken into account, individually and 
collectively.
	2.	 The real difference between the current system state and its desired state through 
the design process, which is useful to judge and evaluate the project’s progres-
sion or maturation.
	3.	 The discovery of important factors in the exostructure or the design context that 
is useful to determine the future interactions with the design context entities and 
elements.
Different discovery and strategic exploration matrices can be built by teams that 
will later analyse the interaction patterns to extract from the social practices related 
to design. According to our vision, the seven spaces reflection (at least) should 
answer several essential questions: Are we trying to resolve essential problems or 
are we entangled in the sub-optimization of processes that have no incidence on the 
change or innovating objectives? Are the partial results satisfying or should we do 
more iterations or other feedback loops? Is our way of performing the design satis-
fying or efficient for all members? Is the seven spaces process a satisfying one? In 
other words, do the matrices allow to discover interactions between components and 
properties that are really relevant for our issues?
10.3.2  Community Informatics and Participative Reflection 
Process
The thinking process contains three main activities: the analysis, the synthesis and 
the reflection in action. These three activities have direct links with the basic seven 
spaces of the community informatics design life cycle (Harvey et al. 2013), with the 
basic mechanisms of the reflexive practice as suggested by the important works of 
10  The Fields and the Definition Taken into Account for the Construction…

339
Donald Schön (1983) and Schön and Bennett (1996) for the main phases of problem-­
solving creative processes described in the works of Daudelin (1996), as well as 
with the generic interactions specific to various design processes as revealed by the 
discovery and strategic alignment matrix.
The analysis stage which corresponds to Space 1 called, “Explore”, consists of 
documenting the subject, collecting the facts, preparing the start questions of the 
entire project and doing the critical analysis of the facts as revealed by a variety of 
tools, use case studies, questionnaires, group discussions and discovery matrices. In 
the preliminary analysis context, the facts are those we bring to light by returning to 
the properties; the factors connected with the various aspects of the issues identified 
by the discovery matrix; the relations between the design situation properties and 
factors, in the sense we described in this chapter; and the design activities per-
formed throughout the design process itself. Evaluation criteria like coherence; 
project boundaries’ identification; the approach and stage complementarity; the 
work consistency; the feasibility, the fidelity and the validity of the analysed facts; 
etc. could be of great utility.
The synthesis stage is a representation, vision and image formation stage that 
suggests a synthesis of analysis facts, either by mapping or by schematization of an 
image enriched as defined by Checkland or by other visualization, modeling or 
simulation software tools. To be equipped with an enriched image of facts and pro-
cesses under study seeks to select elements (entities, components, properties) and to 
give ourselves an image of the DSS to build as globality, as a total ecosystem con-
taining our instantiation concepts supported by discovery matrices analysis ele-
ments as well as concrete facts from the self-reflection done at the analysis stage.
During the stage of reflection in the action, the community informatics expert 
analyses the image obtained at the synthesis stage. He asks the following questions: 
Why is the situation represented this way? What can I learn? What should we 
change? What should be the next steps? Should we keep the same objectives?
10.3.3  Structured Reflection
The structured reflection is a community informatics design process; in the sense we 
understand it in this chapter, it is a combination of a reflection that is rigorous and 
systematic (we call it semiformal) and a reflection that leads on an ad hoc basis, as 
the collaborators team evolves in its reflections and practices in the action. The sys-
tematic approach (not scientific nor completely formal like in pure sciences) contrib-
utes to reduce the risks of avoiding certain important elements of the design process. 
The regular team reflection allows to bring potential changes and to suggest modifi-
cations to adjust the objectives. The structured reflection on the seven stages indi-
cates what changes could be made and when and how they could be implemented. In 
the following pages, we will briefly focus on the “how”, knowing it would be pos-
sible to answer the other questions in the next research or another book.

340
10.3.4  Reflection Regarding the Design Situation 
and the Activities
Towards the end of the APSI project, we had the idea to obtain an overall view of 
important facts regarding several facts from our theoretical models and of a begin-
ning of acquired experience. This exercise ended up in three interrelated lists. The 
first list is an exhaustive description of the community informatics design situation, 
based on the questions relative to the DSS properties and the community informat-
ics design process. The second list suggests a theoretical point of view; it is the 
intention of this chapter to give instantiation elements to carry out as well as the 
design process, exploration, alignment properties to do the first stage and the analy-
sis one. The third list is meant to present the basic concepts and to define the funda-
mental terms associated with DSS properties, in order to extract the forms, 
boundaries, characteristics and attributes; the relations between properties and fac-
tors, in a design situation; the activities really performed; and the planned activities 
according to goals by including a strong communication perspective, in other words, 
the relations and interactions cartography between all these entities, must they be 
tangible and intangible (Verna Allee 1998, 2002), formal and semi-formal, artistic 
and emotional, quantifiable and qualifiable.
During the APSI mandate and through all the co-design processes, whether they 
are workshops, group discussions, modeling or decision-making regarding collab-
orative tools or the choice of social media that are useful for the community infor-
matics design process, our forms took the configuration of tables, sheets of paper 
and task list to fulfil in the management software Communa4 suggested by the 
researcher Abderraman Ourahou, members and partners directory, basic and com-
mon ontologies vocabulary in the philosophical sense of the word. The conservation 
of all these elements is to allow us to come back on certain computer-memorized 
elements or to keep on file the fundamental texts destined to the post-project reflec-
tion (which is the goal of the present book) and to the identification of important 
contents for subsequent publications. The entire chapter seeks to connect the prac-
tice and the theoretical models.
The second list was channelled in the metaphorical expression of “Hassane’s 
boxes”, taken from the list of elements to instantiate by the researcher Hassane 
Beidou, and we had to systematically analyse the conceptual and practical interac-
tions. To make that list, largely inspired by the important work of Luis M. Camarinha-­
Matos and Hamideh Afsarmanesh et al. (2008), we have put together a new smaller 
team of three people and defined, from the first iteration of our own works, our 
reference models and our research results, a list of elements, entities to take into 
account, by keeping in mind the elements surveyed in our questionnaire (the socio-­
demographic characteristics, the types of virtual and innovation communities, 
design, governance, ethics, the project’s closure or expansion activities, etc.), the 
case studies results and the enormous documentation on living labs. This list, and its 
results exposed in the following chapter, helps to take into account a good number 
of elements to maintain in various design situations and in the design activities

341
associated them. It also helps define an instantiation or research framework, in other 
words, design boundaries, by making an inventory of the aspects to be retained by 
the community informatics experts. It finally must be made up to date with current 
sociological, managerial and technological evolution.
For community informatics design as envisioned by the present design proposi-
tion, this list is an example to take into account in the community informatics 
instantiation process presented in the first part of this chapter. It helps to establish 
norms, sections, functionalities and the entities’ properties to instantiate from the 
description and the synthesis of the seven fields to model: the exostructure, the 
endostructure, the community informatics design activities, communication struc-
tures and processes, functionalities, socio-technologies, ethics and values.
The third list, presented as questions, was created by our colleague Marie-
Kettlie André. This detailed list is presented in a text, first inspired by community 
informatics design “seven spaces”, that suggests a “verification list” for the scaf-
folding of the technological, organizational and social architectures and overall 
entities in the design process. In doing this task, with the help of the Camarinha-
Matos and Afsarmanesh framework (2008), and by analysing the precise commu-
nity informatics design situation we have followed, it rather suggests a “nine 
spaces” nomenclature, and that, after a reflexive process of return on our situation 
(and our activities) during several months, in early 2012. This list incorporated to a 
strategic exploration text is presented in Chap. 5. (We can also find long excerpts 
in the Colab website.) It is a fictitious modeling example (instantiation) after the 
completion of the research and development My Portal Col@b mandate realized 
within the APSI project. These nine steps are aligned with the seven initial steps of 
the community informatics design exploratory space, and they complete it by add-
ing two more.
Therefore, from a checklist organized as terms and questions and coming from a 
methodological questioning related to the creation of the seven spaces, several ques-
tions related to the three main architecture types (TOGAF, Ecolead, Zachman) sug-
gested in the present book and a list of questions related to the creation of questions 
contained in “Hassane’s boxes” from the ARCON project, we end up with a sce-
nario example containing the entire elements and research or design activity ques-
tions, as well as two additional stages. Hassane Beidou and Marie Kettlie André 
wanted to answer the generic following questions: What are the Colab or a DSS 
desired properties? What part of the effort and the budget should be dedicated to this 
stage? (Let us remind that the costs and the budget and action plan realization evalu-
ation go through an appropriate terminology definition and by the identification of 
concrete realization steps appropriate to each design situation.) What are the proj-
ect’s stakeholders and what are their needs? What are the generic entities to take 
into account? What are the important steps of the life cycle to determine, to keep, to 
modify and to add? These questions seek to show that users/designers can answer to 
these questions in team while performing an important and interesting approach of 
the life cycle in the light of budget time as presented in Chap. 6 dedicated to the 
presentation of transition state systems theory.
10.3  A Normative Design Process Guiding the Critical Thinking

342
These lists seek to show the feasibility of an instantiation inspired by a reference 
framework norms aiming to explore more concrete possibilities of a project. These 
work propositions for the definition and classification of systems should be evalu-
ated in the next few years in workshops, classes and concrete realizations (longer 
ones). They could, and it is our dearest wish, inspire our future students dealing with 
DSS development during their undergraduate or graduate studies.
10.3.5  Reflection Regarding the Design Situation
The description of a design situation entails that we model reality as we have done 
here, from a certain point of view, of a certain world vision of this reality by neglect-
ing certain characteristics. To do so, we asked ourselves the following questions, 
based on our foundations, our ontological definitions, our definitions of aspects, 
properties, etc. One of the good methods consists of making checklists and forms 
specific to help designers in making decisions on the important elements of a given 
design situation.
To describe a design situation is like explaining the state of a design task to a 
person involved or removed from the project. The problem is formulated in terms of 
reference frameworks and instantiation strategy; the needs to meet are described 
just like the desired solutions, the design process state (in part) and the activities 
associated to it. The means, tools, methodologies and techniques to achieve it are 
also drawn. Social media are described by functionalities, from the life cycle and 
the co-creation process related to it. The desired results are also stated; the fields of 
representation are brought out in order to show the coherence between the life cycle, 
the aspects and the fields to be modeled.
How to describe a design situation? We suggest to do a textual description of a 
set of relevant elements, by giving references of other types of representations: 
matrix, process diagrams, modeling software, specific governance techniques or 
information research and prototypes. The description is a complex combination, 
created in an exhaustive way for a given situation while knowing that at each 
phase of the project, the personalized list of elements to model and instantiate can 
change. The description may contain elements from various disciplines, with 
skills from different fields of expertise or university departments, tangible or 
intangible elements, quantitative or qualitative information and more or less spe-
cialized knowledge. Let us remind that the exercise does not aim at exhaustiveness 
at all cost; it is instead about making a design proposition that maintains the 
aspects, their most important properties and factors. It is important to realize that 
the main goal of the element list described in this chapter is the reflection and the 
non-formalization of a completely document process of the issue relative to a 
solution. We cannot say which aspect is the most important, because it depends of 
each discipline, each task to execute and skills more or less specialized of each 
designer.

10.4  A Fictitious Case Study: Informatics Design Project 
Planning and Its Monitoring by Creating Entities Lists 
Through a Transdisciplinary Interaction Matrix
In the present section, which serves as an introduction for the next chapter, we rely 
on the works performed by researchers David Romero and Arturo Molina (2010) 
described in their article “Virtual organization breeding environment toolkit: 
Reference model, management framework and instantiation methodology”. Our 
goal is not to systematically use their work but get inspired by it and adapt it. In this 
spirit, we will show how to use it in the context of community informatics strategies 
in terms of project structuring, diffusion, innovation, management and planning 
community informatics design that can create a DSS within an organization or a 
territory community or cross-borders.
Therefore, the community informatics design process that we will try to demon-
strate contains a vision oriented towards several conceptual categories described in 
our reference model, with the support of our methodological and systematic itera-
tion process, that refer to the seven fields to model (endostructure, exostructure, 
etc.) within the seven spaces design life cycle presented in the previous chapters. 
One of the first elements of this strategy is to proceed to a first complete iteration of 
the seven phases and by keeping in mind the seven fields to model, but without 
systematically taking them in a fixed way, in other words, by referring to it in terms 
of checklist elements to take into account during the design realization. This list will 
vary according to each specific project. Therefore, at each of the seven design spaces 
(“explore” “imagine”, “resolve”, “incorporate”, “model”, “prototype”, “deploy”), 
we will examine the design tasks to accomplish as well as the terms and concepts 
referring to them, in terms of reference framework and action to undertake. We start 
the process by keeping in mind our seven spaces and our seven fields, and we reor-
ganize them according to large modeling lines that correspond to the open and flex-
ible nature of the community informatics design process. These guidelines, widely 
inspired by our reference framework, endure adjustments from our own experience 
during the reflection on our APSI research design process. These modeling lines for 
a DSS instantiation are:
•	 The composition that refers to the available resources for the community infor-
matics design development as a technological innovation platform.
•	 The functionalities that are made of verbs surrounding the design or that take part 
of its definition (communicate, collaborate, cooperate, innovate, etc.).
•	 The behaviours, to see the approaches and roles attributed to designers by vari-
ous stakeholders.
•	 The ontology, the implementation of governance, ethics and innovation notions.
•	 The DSS dissolution or evolution, the metamorphosis or state transition in terms 
of a virtual community life cycle deploying or dissolving.
•	 The business strategy, also called “organizational strategy (business models and 
platforms)”.
•	 Ethics, a few aspects will also be on the agenda.
10.4  A Fictitious Case Study: Informatics Design Project Planning

344
To reach the short-term objectives of a DSS oriented towards the finalities and 
perspectives at the basis of the collaboration in network systems, community infor-
matics design commands previous co-creation of a good development environment. 
In other words, skills and the capacity to provide the essential conditions and mech-
anisms for a quick and flexible community informatics design configuration. In fact, 
this research presents a community informatics design reference model as a refer-
ence guide for design initiators, designers managers, experts in practice communi-
ties and users/designers in charge of the creation and the functioning of virtual and 
applicative environments.
Therefore, within the community informatics design reference model, the man-
agement aspect is also presented as a set of management activities and support tools 
to ensure a community informatics design will fulfil all the necessary tasks and 
functionalities to reach its objectives. The seven spaces can be considered as a gov-
ernance system, and the community informatics design instantiation method is pre-
sented like a controlled process and monitoring until a certain point, addressing the 
systematic entities, with a series of evaluation measures and then with qualitative 
and semiformal measures, supported by various means (e.g. creativity and modeling 
tools and methods) to help establish management functionalities and operating of a 
design during its complete life cycle, on the community informatics design refer-
ence model basis.
In fact, once again, we remind that this section dedicated to the operationaliza-
tion of a DSS by community informatics design is inspired by Romero and Molina 
(2010, 2011) and is an adaptation and a reappropriation of several concepts discov-
ered during the APSI research and at the heart of our community informatics design 
researches, which gives its highly illustrative value since it combines both 
approaches. In this spirit, this chapter is widely dedicated to create an illustration of 
the way to use the seven iterative spaces of community informatics design while 
adapting them to several elements of our seven fields of modeling (exostructure, 
endostructure, functionalities, resources, etc.) and by the description of entities to 
model contained in a checklist. We will focus on this type of modeling through the 
creation of these lists in the next chapter.

Chapter 11
The Organization and Governance 
of an Incubation and Learning Environment 
with the Help of Tool Boxes: Reference Model, 
Community Informatics Design Framework 
and Instantiation Methodology
For 30 years, a wide variety of long-term strategic alliances have generated organi-
zations such as the industrial clusters (Norman and Porter 2007; Porter and Karmer 
2006), the industrial districts (Becattini et al. 1990) and network organization eco-
systems such as collaborative enterprise networks and interconnective universities. 
These alliances have emerged in common regions (technology hub) gathering orga-
nization groups ready to cooperate with the objective of creating group opportuni-
ties within organizations that taken individually would not have benefited from the 
same development capacities, especially regarding the level of cost.
These alliance strategies have been limited on the long term, either because of 
the geographical proximity of the members making up this group, either because of 
the lack of adequate telepresence or convivial tools. Retroactively, this limitation 
presents a certain advantage, to energize the local cultures common to a group of 
given partners, which facilitates the establishment of a trusting environment and a 
sense of community. Let us think here about the case of the Cité du multimédia and 
the Cité du commerce électronique in Montreal. However, with the ICT, globaliza-
tion, the market in constant movement and new virtual forms’ progress over the past 
few years, these strategic alliances are more and more focused on the virtual indus-
tries (Molina et al. 1998) and on the organization of a virtual gathering of commu-
nity informatics design environments.
These technological trends arouse the interest of organizations, especially the 
small and medium enterprises (SME), in order to overcome their geographical situ-
ation and to join in collaboration with one or several of these organizations in the 
global landscape. Community informatics design and its SADC, which we can 
define as an open-source code innovation ecosystem, to support users or managers 
of online communities and design assistance for interaction websites, are in the 
long-term an interactive design platform that will promote strategic alliances 
between the organizations seeking to offer multimodal conditions (human, finan-
cial, social, infrastructural and organizational) necessary to support the quick and 
fluid configuration of collaborative platforms useful to organizations and society. 
Therefore, community informatics design, defined by the UQAM’s ACIL as 

346
“socially responsible communicational design”, mainly focuses on the creation of a 
suitable environment for the establishment of an adaptation, an appropriation, a 
cooperation and a collaboration, with the help of different technological supports, 
facilitating the implementation of an efficient environment for user/designer 
practices.
However, the DSS are coalitions and organization dynamics created in the short 
term and more or less well adapted to a maturation and collective commitment envi-
ronment (gathering, incubation or learning environment that often commands long-
term activities) to take advantage of a collaboration opportunity between designers 
and virtual environment users. This long-term intersectorial integration for collec-
tive action should done while incorporating the basic skills and necessary resources 
to reach, alongside with the quality frameworks and the evaluation of the delays and 
the costs expected by the recipient users whose cooperation is supported by com-
puter networks (Camarinha-Matos and Afsarmanesh 2007) and digital media.
We have seen in the previous chapters that the present research offers an array of 
tools made of socially responsible design, oriented by seven design phases, a refer-
ence model, a management framework and an instantiation methodology, constitut-
ing a set of guidelines to support the processes and activities involved in the creation 
and functioning of new virtual environments. The community informatics design 
toolkit (the SADC) seeks to help design initiators and managers to understand the 
requirements and the planning mechanisms of the ICT tools and functionality 
management.
11.1  Community Informatics Design Characterization
The traditional organizations’ design is generally focused on the linear and iterative 
transformation of the point-by-point value chain, towards the organization of a net-
work structure known under the name of value network, aiming to increase the 
chances to take advantage of the collaboration opportunities. Community informat-
ics design completes this perspective without rejecting it, based on the efficient ICT 
infrastructures to overcome the geographical constraints, in order to provide the 
common basis to instantiate the interaction between its members and with the final-
ity of facilitating the configuration and the implementation of DSS.
The design then focuses on the introduction of new approaches and reinforce-
ment mechanisms of trust as prerequisites for any collaboration. Therefore, com-
munity informatics design seeks to improve the members’ preparation to join the 
community, the potential of future DSS defining a common ICT infrastructure stand 
and commercial rules of cooperation between autonomy and heterogeneity of com-
munities of practice through electronic means (e.g. the information on systems and 
data bases; Afsarmanesh and Camarinha-Matos 2005).
11  The Organization and Governance of an Incubation and Learning Environment…

11.2  Community Informatics Design’s Aim and Benefits
As we have mentioned above, community informatics design seeks to establish a 
trusting basis between users and designers collaborating in a DSS, by reducing the 
costs and unnecessary delays to find suitable partners and to perform well-inte-
grated architectural configurations, while providing the appropriate assistance (e.g. 
for methods, resources and tools) in order to reduce the complexity of the imple-
mentation and management throughout the digital social system creation process 
(Camarinha-Matos et al. 2005a, b, c). However, a community informatics design 
process development can provide various benefits to its users (e.g. in a creative way 
and to join a group environment that meet their requirements).
The most relevant benefits, according to researchers like Camarinha-Matos and 
Abreu (2005), Afsarmanesh and Camarinha-Matos (2005) and Camarinha-Matos 
and Afsarmanesh (2006), are:
	 1.	 The flexibility in the leveraging of fundamental perspectives, to create a virtual 
system to facilitate the emergence of a possible collaboration in terms of 
organization
	 2.	 The increase of the apparent size, to compete with big enterprises
	 3.	 Influential lobbying and marketing, to widen the geographic presence coverage 
and the access to occasional global markets
	 4.	 An increased negotiation power, for joint purchases
	 5.	 ICT infrastructure system access, transparent, easy to use and affordable, serv-
ing as a catalyser of interoperability between designers
	 6.	 The performance of mechanisms, directives and services destined to facilitate 
the creation of the virtual system process
	 7.	 Proactivity, community informatics design facilitating the member profiling 
and skills management in order to ensure the availability of skills and resources 
to take advantage of the collaboration possibilities
	 8.	 Support to the provision of services, such as insurance, guidance and training, 
through support institutions
	 9.	 The introduction of mechanism-establishing trust between community infor-
matics design users
	10.	 General guidelines for the collaboration, especially regarding work and shar-
ing between DSS users
Nevertheless, Afsarmanesh and Camarinha-Matos (2005) list a set of require-
ments with respect to community informatics design to function properly and gen-
erate all these benefits:
	 1.	 A strong ICT infrastructure, providing a set of tools to support community 
informatics design in the management and the digital social systems creation 
process
	 2.	 An active participation of community informatics design users including updat-
ing the information on basic skills
11.2  Community Informatics Design’s Aim and Benefits

	3.	 The establishment of a viable modeling system of community informatics design 
organization
	4.	 The establishment of community informatics design management strategies and 
governance rules
11.3  Community Informatics Design Value Creation 
Perspectives
Generally, community informatics design represents real organization ecosystems 
where trust is progressively built and where virtual environment dynamics are cre-
ated each time collaboration opportunities are present or identified. In fact, com-
munity informatics design creates value for its users by offering a set of services, 
including various tools and methodologies, for the creation of a field of interaction 
and common cooperation between users and designers, aiming towards their 
involvement in a real virtual system dynamic. Also, community informatics design 
creates value for the market, mainly, thanks to the dynamic resulting from the cre-
ation processing seeking to select the most suitable virtual system in the eyes of the 
partners and according to their basic skills. The main goal here is to exploit the 
unique capacities and the strategic assets to deliver a product, a service or an appli-
cation respecting time, cost and expected quality constraints.
In sum, in terms of value creation, the community informatics design strategies 
aim to help their users discover and develop new ways to promote technological 
innovation and economic growth through collaboration means (Romero et al. 2006).
11.4  The Community Informatics Design Life Cycle
A community informatics design life cycle constitutes all the phases of an incuba-
tion environment of collective network activities, where we can cross all stages 
from the creation phase (space 1, “Explore”) until the representation of a possible 
dissolution, going through the organization processes performed by community 
informatics design managers during all these stages. We explore, we analyse, we 
document and we diagnose communicational needs and requirements. The creation 
stage, “Explore”, can be divided in two substages: the initiation and recruitment:
	1.	 The initiation phase is interested in various themes like strategic pre-planning, 
issues and initial incubations of the maturation environment (gathering, incuba-
tion or learning environment).
	2.	 The project launch phase (not the DSS launch as planned in stage 7, “Deploy”) 
is the constitution and the launch of the community informatics design process.
11  The Organization and Governance of an Incubation and Learning Environment…

349
The first substage could be about the generic exploitation of the community 
informatics design reference framework and its object and themes to develop; 
whereas at this evolution stage, we process small daily changes in community infor-
matics design, as functioning principles, in order to start the design process.
The second substage is the metamorphosis, big changes made to the community 
informatics design functioning principles that result in a new operating form. 
Partnerships are examined and the recruitment and partner commitment process is 
initiated. We explore possible avenues and solutions.
11.5  The Community Informatics Design Reference Model
We have seen in Chap. 6 that a reference model is a generally well-known concep-
tual framework. The comprehension all designers have of certain design concepts, 
entities and relations must be significant, in order to facilitate the implementation of 
guidelines and the creation of specific models in the field of virtual communities. 
The “holistic” reference model described in the present book is not really well 
known, but it relies on several common terms, documented from an abundant review 
of the literature, whether in systems theory, in design, in management and technol-
ogy or in social and communicational sciences.
The community informatics design reference model seeks to synthesize and for-
malize basic concepts, principles and long-term practices of collaboration networks. 
Therefore, the community informatics design reference model framework sug-
gested in this study sought to provide a common framework for traditional repro-
duction environments (oriented towards production and services), like living labs 
and fab labs, industrial clusters, organization ecosystems like technopoles as well as 
new aspects like emergency networks in case of disasters and colab virtual networks 
(Camarinha-Matos and Afsarmanesh 2006).
The community informatics design reference model mainly consists of present-
ing a complete overview of the key elements and components of an incubation and 
learning environment and formulating the main requirements allowing to create and 
manage the course of its entire life cycle in seven phases.
Tables 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6, 11.7, 11.8, 11.9, 11.10, 11.11, 11.12, 
11.13, 11.14, and 11.15 constitute a checklist of entities to take into account in a 
normalized design approach. They present a community informatics design based 
on a reference model from the ARCON modeling, defining two subspaces each 
equipped with four types of modeling representing the point of view on DSS to 
build, inspired by our seven fields to model. These modelings give an abstract rep-
resentation of a community informatics incubation and learning environment from 
its interior environment (endogenous elements or endostructure) and exterior ones 
(the exogenous or exostructure interactions).
At this stage, it is important to mention that the community informatics design 
reference model containing seven fields to model only aims to give a first synthetic 
overview of the environment’s key elements as described in various chapters of the

The dissolution entails all the assets shared by the CID users/designers; the main person in charge of this process is the CID manager. In the university context, it 
is all about the research result sharing, their diffusion and the sharing of products and potential applications. In the context of an enterprise, various types of 
intellectual, human, social, financial, material or organizational capitals can be shared within a platform (a business platform or a design platform as DSS). See

present book. Nevertheless, it cannot be considered as finished or exhaustive since 
new elements can be added to it or removed from it depending on the needs and 
requirements specific to each project while respecting the concerns raised by design-
ers, design managers, virtual communities and communities of practice (COP) 
experts as well as the characteristics of the design situation according to its applica-
tion field, its environment and the intervention contents. Therefore, the seven fields 
are not static but heuristic and dynamic.
11.5.1  Community Informatics Design Endostructure
In this spirit, the endogenous elements making up community informatics design 
endostructure aim to identify a set of specific properties and characteristics to cap-
ture a design practice and to constitute the elements and suggest different modeling 
framework like ARCON that promotes modeling of this subfield. Therefore, from 
our reference framework comprised of seven fields, we can realize the design of a 
set of elements and entities and describe them from various modeling angles. Each 
developers’ team can choose the fields and elements to model, the types of represen-
tation and modeling as well as the analysis level of depth or detail. These elements 
and their modeling angle are divided into four subfields:
	1.	 The structural elements, referring to the community informatics design’s struc-
ture from the network and constituent elements such as actors, roles, relations as 
well as the network topology of a community of practice
	2.	 The compositional elements, referring to the community informatics design’s 
composition of human and material resources, users, socio-technologies, infra-
structures, information, knowledge and ontologies
	3.	 The functional elements, to assist the community informatics design process 
implementation, as well as procedures, methodologies and basic functions and 
operations associated to the various stages of the community informatics design 
life cycle
	4.	 The behavioural elements, encompassing principles, policies, community infor-
matics design governance and ethics rules for designers making them adapt their 
behaviour to the pre-established norms regarding the use of community infor-
matics design
11.5.2  Community Informatics Design Structural View
Structural modeling allows to identify a plurality of actors, roles, relations and other 
community informatics design structural characteristics. In fact, community infor-
matics design actors and users are the organizations registered in the DSS environ-
ment. First of all, we observe the commercial entities, private organizations and

government institutions that offer products and services on the market instead of 
getting involved in the organization of digital and online communities to enjoy 
quantitative benefits, such as durability and economic aspects. The second aspect to 
remember refers to the non-profit institutions like NGOs and support institutions 
involved in the organization of the virtual environment to make enormous qualita-
tive benefits. Here we can talk about social prestige or social capital. Finally, the last 
community informatics design structural element refers to legal services, contrac-
tual service providers and enterprises ensuring the maintenance of individuals’ 
lives. It is important to mention at this level the entire aspect of access to new cli-
ents, for example, insurance and training companies, ministries, associations in the 
ICT and design sector, chambers of commerce as well as environmental organiza-
tions campaigning for a healthy sociobiological ecosystem.
Furthermore, different roles can be played by community informatics design 
actors, designers and users. These roles are taken into account in the incubation 
and learning environment specific to each DSS. Stakeholders negotiate their par-
ticipation rules from their respective meaning fields they later put in common for 
future action and activities. Together, they determine the envisioned challenges. 
Thus, we find:
•	 The members (users) of community informatics design, forming the basis of the 
role played by design organizations or online practices that are ready to partici-
pate in design activities.
•	 The administrator or director (manager) of community informatics design, play-
ing a role of the person in charge of the platform’s functioning and evolution as 
well as the role of promoter of the cooperation between the members possessing 
design skills. He also has the mandate of recruiting new organizations or inviting 
them to participate in the daily management of general community informatics 
design processes. Alongside these functions, the manager ensures and facilitates 
dispute resolutions as well as the preparation of active tools to make the com-
munity informatics design policies common to all design users.
•	 The broker, in charge of identifying and acquiring new collaboration opportuni-
ties through marketing and promotion strategies, also possesses negotiation 
skills with community informatics design potential clients.
•	 The digital social system planner (organization or community), assuming the 
responsibility of identifying the necessary skills and the virtual systems partners’ 
potential in terms of new virtual organizations structuring.
•	 The virtual system’s coordinator (organization or community), in charge of the 
virtual community management throughout its life cycle, in order to fulfil the 
objectives set within a collaboration opportunity.
•	 The community informatics design advisor also playing the role of advisor in 
charge in the specific expertise fields of collaborative design assists community 
informatics design users, members and managers in their daily tasks.
•	 The services related to community informatics design, focused on contributors 
responsible to provide or transmit a wide variety of services, support tools and 
mechanisms to various community informatics design actors.

•	 Institutional support supervisor, keeping community informatics design up to 
date by incorporating the trends and the new technologies of his field of exper-
tise, in order to suggest optimized solutions to help users or design managers 
accomplish their mission.
•	 Community informatics design’s guests, organizations located outside the com-
munity informatics design process and interested to find general information on 
the learning environment to potentially become members of a community infor-
matics design team.
In other words, different relations can be established between community infor-
matics design actors (members, users, designers, peers, stakeholders), each entail-
ing different degrees of interdependence that go from collaboration networks to 
coordination and cooperation networks in order to trace a collaboration continuum 
towards the multiplication of inter-organizational relations. These relations and 
interactions are described in the discovery and strategic alignment matrices that, by 
reusing the elements of an instantiated concepts list, examine several important 
interactions between the fields to model: the exostructure, the endostructure, the 
community informatics design activities, the communicational structures and pro-
cesses, the functionalities, the socio-technologies and the ethics.
As clearly described by Camarinha-Matos and Afsarmanesh (2006), it is a net-
working involving a communication and an information on the benefits of mutual 
exchanges by comparing generalized utilities and collaborative actions (Moles and 
Rohmer 1986; Harvey 1996). As for coordination, which constitutes the second ele-
ment of reflection of these researchers, in addition to activities they consist of align-
ing or modifying, the goal is to wait for more efficient results. Finally, the notion of 
cooperation extends and explains the interdependencies associated with resource 
sharing between design actors to reach compatible objectives.
In sum, these important concepts represent constituent elements of a generic 
social architecture seeking a good collaboration between design users. This collabo-
ration is considered, as previously mentioned, like a process where risks, resources, 
responsibilities and rewards are shared by these actors in the achievement of a com-
mon objective.
Finally, in order to distinguish a new community informatics design features, 
researchers Camarinha-Matos and Afsarmanesh (2007) suggest a semi-typology, in 
order to identify and postulate the specific attributes of the existing and emerging 
properties of a design oriented towards the determination of skills profiles and rel-
evant characteristics (the design situation). This semi-typology can be summarized 
in four community informatics design types or fields. They are the stable field of 
products and services (available in open-source code on the market or online), the 
one-of-a-kind stable domain like electricity or citizen services, the emerging field 
(the type of DSS to build) and a field led by innovation (new process, new work 
methods, new forms of production or applications, etc.).
11.5  The Community Informatics Design Reference Model

402
From these first checklists of entities to model, we can make sub-lists by examin-
ing the entities to model according to the seven spaces of design. Therefore, in the 
following tables, we make a list of entities by using the action verbs corresponding 
to the activities contained in these seven design spaces (Camarinha-Matos and 
Afsarmanesh 2007, 2008) (Tables 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6, 11.7, 11.8, 11.9, 11.10, 
11.11, 11.12, 11.13, 11.14 and 11.15).
The examination of this checklist for a DSS community informatics instantiation 
allows to discover the complexity of the structures and the decision-making that 
intervene in the development of numerous types of digital institutions and environ-
ments. We believe it resolves a certain number of issues but it also creates new ones. 
Let us simply think about ethics and aesthetics concepts and questions we have not 
addressed until now. It is only the beginning of a complex process that will need the 
support of creativity, simulation and visualization tools. In the next section, on the 
first checklist basis, we will show the utility of crossing all these fields in a first 
trans-field discovery matrix (non-exhaustive) related to the healthcare field.
11.6  Trans-field Interactions
In this section, we present an illustration of the relations’ evaluation between enti-
ties from the need and utility to constitute checklists in the healthcare field.
We will use here some of the several elements of the checklist presented in the 
previous section in order to examine and illustrate with examples the interactions 
between several fields with entities, properties and components that could be essen-
tial to the start of a new community informatics design project. In compliance to our 
first chapters where we insisted on the relevancy and importance to identify rela-
tions (between fields, between entities, between domains) in order to help the reflec-
tion and decision-making about design, we are connecting here the creation of the 
list and the relations between the fields in the healthcare sector.
In the present section, we will use certain elements of our checklist while com-
paring their contents, which helps the decision-making. The majority of these exam-
ples are the results of our own modeling experience and virtual community 
implantation at the Centre Hospitalier Pierre-Le-Gardeur, within a project we car-
ried out with our colleagues Albert Lejeune and Gilles Lemire as well as several 
UQAM students. The project that took place between 2003 and 2006 was entitled 
“community informatics and distributed learning”. Here are interaction examples 
corresponding to several relations between fields already identified in the present 
chapter. Let us be reminded that the objective of the exercise is not to drain the sub-
ject of be exhaustive but to show the utility of making element checklists (entities, 
components) and to evaluate the performance of the 2MDSAM matrix for a team of 
users/designers and community informatics experts containing degrees of skills and 
various expertise:

403
•	 The Exogenous Element Interactions × Stakeholders: The exostructure elements 
can affect entities (properties, components, elements) of certain endostructure 
parts like the stakeholders. It is the case of the computerization of electronic 
patient files in a hospital where socio-demographic characteristics command the 
reorganization of trainings, because of dissimilar skills levels of actors and spe-
cialities to implement in this upgrade.
•	 The Exostructure × Objective Interactions: The exogenous elements often influ-
ence the setting of objectives. The increase of a beneficiary population affects the 
profitability of hospital services.
•	 The Exostructure × Functionality Interactions: The exostructure (the market) 
can influence the development of information services and the knowledge level 
with respect to the planning of contents. A hospital could be tempted to add new 
functionalities like management services and knowledge sharing in response to 
certain cultural or socio-demographic characteristics or from a market (exoge-
nous factors).
•	 The Exostructure × Socio-technology Interactions: An exogenous element can 
affect technological objects or their acquisition, if it concerns policy and govern-
ment infrastructure acquisition and appropriation procedures. This case requires 
consultation by the hospital informational resource department, websites and 
government documentation regulation policies on infrastructures used by the 
hospital and its regional partners.
•	 The Exostructure × Design Activity Interactions: The exogenous elements can 
influence the situation and the design activities as well as the necessary changes 
for the hospital system, because some information can be publicly revealed while 
others must be kept strictly confidential and can only be shared by the profes-
sional body. The state of science and best medical practices can also play an 
important role.
•	 The Stakeholder × Exostructure Interactions: Even if we noticed earlier that in 
most cases, individuals and stakeholders do not have any influence on political or 
cultural environment factors, they can have some influence at certain moments 
through democratic means like voting, protesting or committing to large-scale 
projects. The medication cost takeover by the state or certain organizations; the 
increase of virtual healthcare communities in a region, the number of family doc-
tors in a province; the training of clinical communities of practice in a particular 
sector like mental health, blood banks and artificial insemination; and ethics in 
biotechnologies are all examples where a plurality of stakeholders or participants 
must obtain consensus for the design decision-making or have constructive citi-
zen dialogues.
•	 Stakeholder × Objective Interactions: The structures, properties and components 
of stakeholders (endostructure) influence the DSS design objective definition. 
For example, if the hospital management suggests a service reorganization or a 
new strategic plan, it can face opposition or inertia, or on the contrary, obtain the 
support of social or organizational groups depending on the process and structure 
characteristics that could feel threatened by the new structure or strategy. A DSS 
multi-field matrix could cross the entities of the new strategic policy with the 
11.6  Trans-field Interactions

404
policy positions of different actors in a data base in order to document a serious 
theoretical multi-gamer model to analyse opinion divergence, to analyse the flow 
of positive or negative actions for the project and try to align the interests.
•	 Stakeholder × Functionality Interactions: This matrix allows to map the socio-
metric influences the stakeholders have over the corresponding functionalities. 
For example, a hospital functionality in the issue of knowledge network diffu-
sion in practice communities that will be related to stakeholders interested by 
this functionality.
•	 Stakeholder × Socio-technology Interactions: DSS stakeholders generally wish 
to make the decisions regarding social media platforms and collaborative and 
creative tools that concern the DSS to co-build or destined to accompany the 
design process. There are “socio-constructivist” interactions between stakehold-
ers and the choices of infrastructures, software and tools. During the implanta-
tion of home care services, a community of “nomadic therapists” might want to 
choose the best mobile tools for diagnosis and the sharing of knowledge by net-
work between the members on the ground and professional services at a 
hospital.
•	 Stakeholder × Activity (Design) Interactions: The human elements contribute to 
an array of tasks and sub-tasks within a DSS project. In a practice and learning 
community social media functionalities in the hospital environment, they can 
model the tasks by conceptual mapping (e.g. a rich picture), describe the medical 
acts, carry performance studies, contribute to the redaction of charts and forms, 
mediatize all sorts of files related to the execution of their tasks, make mock-ups 
of learning scenarios and imagine new ways of doing.
•	 Objective × Exostructure Interactions: The populational objectives of a DSS can 
influence the dimensions, properties and endogenous values associated to it. In a 
hospital system, the creation of virtual communities can question the traditional 
role of the doctor and his expertise, confronted to the new reality of tribes and 
communities of practice progression or healthcare learning. The healthcare DSS 
objectives can affect the public perception regarding the real doctor’s skills or his 
real and exclusive expertise to provide cares.
•	 Objective × Stakeholder Interactions: DSS objectives can affect the stakehold-
ers. The creation of virtual professional communities can affect the professional 
relations or the departments and their relations with their patients. These new 
relations can also affect the questioning about doctors’ and nurses’ remuneration 
since they see their tasks diminish with the progression of preventative cares 
provided by the community.
•	 Objective × Functionality Interactions: The functional composition and decom-
position of a DSS start with the objectives pursued by the community in charge 
of the DSS co-creation. For example, if a community of practice objective is to 
support the clinical service efforts of a hospital, the relations hypotheses, the 
ones diagnosing an illness, which ensures the best response for specific or urgent 
cares in a given field that received a complaint and processes it, refer to function-
alities such as the reception of hospital admission messages, the responsibility in 
answering such messages and ensuring the patient transport and the priority 
treatment of the patient and so on and so forth.

405
•	 Function × Objective Interactions: From the moment where designers’ work 
tries to align or directly direct the entire or a part of the functions to the DSS 
objectives, several interactions are occurring between functionalities and the 
DSS objectives. An example consists of aligning the structure of communities of 
practice with the hospital management process: an analyst could measure the 
cost of resources and workforce allocated for each DSS objective to meet (patient 
support, clinical service support, document writing for prevention).
•	 Functionality × Socio-technology Interactions: The attribution of functionality 
maps each functionality specific to an element or certain DSS properties. Each 
functionality is corresponded with a physical component, an infrastructure ele-
ment or a particular social media. For example, the functionalities to “memorize 
information corresponding to patients’ files” and “model relations between vari-
ous services” will be associated with modeling capacities from Cmap or mind 
map.
•	 Functionality × Activity Interactions: There are several interactions between the 
design activity system and the functionalities the DSS has to assume. The “dis-
tribution of an appropriate medication to various groups of patients” function 
corresponds to activities, norms and procedures occurring in the task chain asso-
ciated with the delivery of the right medication to each patient.
•	 The Socio-technology × Exostructure Interactions: There are numerous interac-
tions within socio-technologies and between them and the environment of socio-
technical projects like DSS for the innovation. The existing hospital infrastructures 
can constitute new material, just like the lack of skills can slow down the appro-
priation of new telecommunication infrastructures. Some needs like large diag-
nosis devices (scanners) cannot be met because of a lack of resources from the 
government to the hospitals.
•	 The Socio-technology × Functionality Interactions: All ICT and all infrastruc-
tures can be described by a functionality. However, in the case of a hospital or 
another public establishment like a university, the acquisition cost represents a 
property containing attributes (different prices can change quarterly) likely to 
prevent the purchase of necessary material and the obtainment of a functionality. 
Open-source code software configurable by available local teams can represent 
an alternative solution. For example, the acquisition cost of an exclusive com-
munity information system (e.g. a business platform or a social design platform) 
has a direct link with the sub-functionalities of knowledge management.
•	 The Socio-technology × Activity (Design Process) Interactions: Most activities 
related to a DSS and socio-technical systems generally require suitable technolo-
gies. Several DSS designs contain processes, tasks and sub-tasks that require 
technologies: the modeling process, highly complex and specialized, that 
requires computing modeling tools, crossed matrices between functionalities to 
create with the technologies accompanying them which has an important inci-
dence on the activities related to the design process. In certain cases, these con-
straints have a decisive impact on modeling and the feasibility of complex digital 
social systems.
11.6  Trans-field Interactions

406
•	 The Activity (Design) × Exostructure (Environment) Interactions: The activities 
related to a particular design situation interact with exogenous elements. For 
example, an analysis of the procedures on the cycle of adopting the best steriliza-
tion practices in a hospital can reveal that excellent practices occurring every day 
might not appear in the government portal and are never used as exemplary prac-
tices in the entire hospital system even if empirical scientific data validate this 
data. The problem of updating all members’ knowledge occurs regarding the 
great trends or best practices (exostructure) undergoing in a hospital or a given 
community.
•	 The Activity (Design Process) × Stakeholder Interactions: A feedback targeting 
certain stakeholders can be useful, for example, to notify the interested parties 
the slowness or the stop of a computing system and the success rate of the new 
tool appropriation of the satisfaction level of patients regarding the implantation 
of a service prototype or even to remind an administrator the non-respect of a 
commitment or a contract.
•	 The Activity (Design Process) × Socio-technology Interactions: A socio-techni-
cal system the scope of a DSS dedicated to knowledge management in a hospital 
can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, even 10 or 20 million of dollars. 
Therefore, it is important to identify socio-technologies related to design pro-
cesses and activities that will support hospital DSS activities because the auto-
mation of certain functions at great costs may harm the hospital or partner 
institutions instead of helping them if a strategic alignment analysis matrix of 
micro-, meso- and macro-care acts performed by the hospital is not correctly 
carried out (it is the fine analysis of what people do in their everyday task).
11.7  Construction Guide of a Discovery and Strategic 
Alignment Matrix (2MDSAM)
The 2MDSAM is a useful collaborative tool to develop different modes of thinking 
and relations in a wide diversity of analysis fields, namely, service design, great 
socio-technical systems, business platforms and innovation communities, collabor-
ative project management and the analysis of many types of digital social systems 
design. A 2MDSAM co-construction, like a community informatics design life-
cycle process, is a circular, iterative and non-linear process, because it does not take 
place according to a sequence of predefined stages. The community informatics 
expert has the latitude to add, subtract or modify the information on DSS fields and 
properties throughout the seven design spaces’ process. Before building a 2MDSAM, 
the analyst/designer and his team have to determine the project’s goals, define the 
type of DSS to model and determine the information sources and data useful to the 
first decision-making. Table 11.16 reproduces a first exploratory matrix we have 
created for a team we are part of at UQAM (the Citizen Commission group, under 
the direction of Mireille Tremblay). This matrix serves to identify the priority

information before making deeper decisions about the DSS to build, thanks to 
detailed discovery matrices. It corresponds to space 1, “Explore”, and also allows to 
review the elements related to the six other design spaces by favouring a first itera-
tion of the complete cycle, in the first analysis. We believe it is a simple and efficient 
starting tool.
After answering these types of question in a particular workshop or at the begin-
ning of any DSS projects (for example in using these questions in Space 1 “Explore”), 
and according to the nature and complexity of each project, a group of users/design-
ers or a group of diverse stakeholders could take the decision of not modeling cer-
tain fields and abandon certain others in a clear manner. They could also decide to 
proceed differently if time, cost or skills constraints could hinder the process. In 
other cases, it will be necessary to model all domains for different reasons like secu-
rity, the exhaustiveness needs, the aesthetics or artistic aspects or the particular 
requirements of a sponsor.
In the case of a DSS community informatics design, a project manager using a 
2MDSAM could start by suggesting to use the simplified matrices presented above 
to a list of stakeholders involved in the project in order to explore the orientations 
and to proceed to a bird’s-eye view analysis. Certain participants involved in the 
design and potential users of the service, the application or the DSS could also be 
part of it. Then, this social matrix made of stakeholders, partners, communities and 
potential users could be organized in a more detailed way by gathering the needs, 
roles and possible relations’ information between various parties, what we call the 
“stakeholder matrix”. It is the first matrix to build.
The second matrix to build is the objective matrix. Generally, the objectives are 
formulated by action verbs. The different information sources that constitute it 
could include the first matrix participants’ conditions and requirements; the market-
ing data obtained from interviews, discussion groups or questionnaires; data 
obtained on the Web; as well as other sources. While building the objective matrix, 
the community informatics experts and the user/designer community of practice 
could put in relation each objective with each stakeholder identified in the 
Stakeholder × Objective matrix. All users/designers or participants of a project can 
infer a good amount of important knowledge of these three matrices, schematically 
the main stakeholders and their objectives. This information is vital to each seven 
design spaces’ life cycle because it helps designers to understand the roles of part-
ners, in order to know which one is influencing what aspect of the life cycle and 
which ones are affected at what moment and for what reason.
Then, the members could build the DSS functionality matrix by decomposing 
the DSS under construction and its constituent functions. The objective action verbs 
can be reused or diversified in order to attribute the functions. The attribution of 
functions relates the functionality matrix to the socio-technology matrix 
(Functionalities × Socio-technologies) as well as the activity matrix (Functionalities 
× Activities) as the digital social systems designers (communitician) ensure the sug-
gested designs support the entire DSS functionalities.
The socio-technology matrix, more specifically, represents the portion chan-
nelled in socio-technical design. It examines relations between technical subsys-

409
tems (social media, collaborative and design tools, platforms) and other fields and 
their components (objectives, functionalities, activities). The activity matrix 
observes the relations between the DSS processes (activities) and the tasks and sub-
tasks to realize while aligning them. The 2MDSAM also allows users/designers and 
community informatics experts to link each relevant part to the design activities 
(Stakeholders × Activities) and the socio-technology components to the activities 
(Socio-technologies × Activities), in order to capture information and important 
knowledge on the interaction and the interconnectivity between fields.
The designers/analysts can identify and memorize the factors related to the endo-
structure and the exostructure, thanks to the construction of the environment matrix 
that considers the exogenous and the endogenous elements. This aspect we have 
greatly developed in the present chapter through an important checklist presentation 
helps them capture important information on the social and human aspects that are 
too often forgotten by computing specialists and traditional information sciences. 
As the DSS community informatics design matures through the stakeholder com-
munication throughout its life cycle, the 2MDSAM records the transitions of state 
and the evolution of components between the fields.
For the collaborative management of DSS design projects, community informat-
ics experts as well as non-experts people can easily follow a procedure similar to the 
one we are proposing in the 2MDSAM framework. Our component listing from the 
previous section is an example. It all depends on the developing DSS maturity; the 
elements and sources and the quality of the information necessary for the construc-
tion of a DSS will vary within each project.
For example, a simple spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel can generally 
be used to build a simple 2MDSAM and offer a variety of statistics and very valu-
able mathematical tools. Simple double-entry similarity matrices can be used to 
master the complexity of fields to take into account in order to improve the DSS 
design. However, in the future, analysis and visual modeling tools will have to be 
used or created in order to realize the full 2MDSAM potential.

The Conclusion: Towards a Computerized 
Modeling Tool for a 2MDSAM with Fully 
Qualified and Assigned Functionalities
The future tasks we need to accomplish to create a 2MDSAM with fully qualified 
information represent a highly complex socio-technical modeling. However, to 
simplify this task, our team will use software like the systems modeling and the 
representation tool created at MIT by Jason Bartolomei’s team. Among the new 
tools, the systems modeling and representation tool (SMART) is one of the best for 
the construction of systems models, like the 2MDSAM, from the documentation 
system and text systems (Bartolomei et al. 2012). He performs this task by using a 
new process, the qualitative knowledge construction (or QKC). SMART records 
the information for different classes of the matrix’s knots, relations and properties 
(attributes) over time and facilitates the extraction of information and knowledge 
by allowing to export them and translate them into mathematical formulas 
(Bartolomei 2007).
The QKC process is a technique of qualitative information incorporation in sys-
tems models. We would like to use such tools to instantiate the qualitative informa-
tion in systems models, in our case, DSS models and their various fields. The 
information could be gathered by interview, questionnaire or discussion groups and 
by different types of observation. It is converted into text that is subsequently coded 
or tagged by content analysis categories (knots, relations, reports, properties and 
attributes). Once coded or inserted in an image grammar, the data is automatically 
incorporated to an enriched data structure (organized to increase the intelligibility) 
that uses colour, geometric shapes and movement languages to catalyse the infor-
mation and represent it. The system or the social system targeted by the analysis is 
then visually represented by distribution of values in a cell; the data rendering that 
supports the representation is contained in the cells. By developing a program 
aiming to translate textual observations reports and coded data interviews likely to 
be systematically and quantitatively analysed, the communication or social science 
researcher can translate the qualitative information into quantitative information.
By establishing a transparency and an obvious traceability in the qualitative and 
quantitative translation process, this type of tool fulfills Warfield’s promise stated in 
the first chapter when we wanted to bring precision without necessarily be ­confronted 

412
by the mathematics barrier. While doing their data processing work, human and 
social researchers do not need to be mathematics and statistics experts to identify, 
observe and model DSS. Software like QKC lifts these epistemological barriers, 
paving the way to the construction of better social systems models, better application 
designs and a collaborative complexity management.
The demonstration of a 2MDSAM construction can be performed here without a 
longer development. Let us simply remind that such models offer enormous benefits 
for the analysis, monitoring, simulation and imagination of new DSS. The 2MDSAM 
we present here represents a substantial effort from our team to offer a framework 
containing a deep logic allowing to organize and represent knowledge related to 
large-scale socio-technical systems as presented in the first chapter, according to the 
meaning and definition Warfield gives.
12.1  Towards a Universal Generic Visual Language Model
Modeling and visualization tools like Stella and the Métaphore universelle inc. 
(visualization and representation software of complex data with the help of metaphors 
like spheres, colour, shapes and movement) could help establish a visualization 
prototype of the transition state structure of activities during a DSS, thus providing 
a feasibility demonstration for design activity analysis and psychosocial processes 
involved in the construction of DSS. Let us briefly examine a possible research 
scenario where the challenge is to examine the interesting generic functionalities to 
represent the co-construction of online organizations and DSS. The argument here 
is to use 3D modeling software for the complex political planning and implementa-
tion of new governance mechanisms of large-scale socio-technical projects. First, 
we have insisted on the fact that any type of large-scale project required design ads 
implementation of suitable governance processes. Any governance type represents 
a challenge for cognitive mastery and comprehension of organizations complexity 
and DSS. The use of traditional project charts, electronic acetates and simple cogni-
tive maps are not suitable for the capture of DSS complexity and evolution. We will 
need extra coherence in the analysis. Here, we will use as an example the precursory 
works of Anthony Judge (2008a). This researcher, in his website and through various 
works and conferences, has explored at length the use of polyhedrons to represent 
the complexity and the way to computerize this process to facilitate the emergence, 
representation and transformation of “psychosocial organizations”, his own expres-
sion, which correspond to our DSS. Inspired by very important authors, like Atkin, 
Fuller and D. Alexander, the Australian researcher Anthony Judge considers that 
polyhedrons, especially those that refer to a high complexity, offer representation 
devices on which system’s complexity can be represented in a way to improve 
mnemonic possibilities and to validate a sense of transformational potential, 
especially when these validation factors are reinforced by regularity, symmetry, 
movement and transition properties and by a palette of suitable colours.
12  The Conclusion: Towards a Computerized Modeling Tool for a 2MDSAM…

413
Our statement will be to consider the possibilities and functionalities offered by 
the use of visualization metaphors like the polyhedrons as conceptual support, 
cognitive help or support to collaborative works of practice communities.
Here, we pick up some elements suggested by Judge who utilizes the Stella soft-
ware functionalities (Robert Webb 2000) that can represent today and in the future 
complex 3D and 4D phenomena in various governance contexts of vast collabora-
tive design projects. We focus here on certain applications that can be commonly 
used in this optic and on the way we could extend them as support to certain fields 
and identified functionalities in our instantiation strategy and discovery matrix pro-
cess in particular. Our use of the Stella software is justified by the fact that it is very 
well-known of our French-speaking colleagues and that this imaginative attitude 
could be applied to other similar visualization software for modeling assistance. 
Our succinct development simply seeks to show the feasibility of transfer of such 
toll configuration process towards other visualization tools at the service of design-
ers. Implicitly, we wish to explore if such application can suggest unexpected 
approaches likely to facilitate the emergence, representation and transformation of 
virtual organizations and DSS, whether for remote work groups, virtual teams, net-
work organizations, collaborative inter-enterprise alliances, large-scale issues, cul-
tural intervention strategies or concepts and values related to the planning of great 
socio-technical systems.
Our outlook on DSS facilitation, their emergence and their representation 
depends on the confluence and transdisciplinary convergence of independent 
research fields that unfortunately have remained unexplored during several years, 
especially because of intellectual property issues or a lack of managers training, for 
example:
•	 The purely geometric representation of the polyhedron upon which rely the sym-
metric tensegrities: in a virtual network organization or a DSS, tensegrity (attrib-
uted to Buckminster Fuller) is a metaphor made of the words “tension” and 
“integrity”; we define it temporarily as the study of tensions, harmony, balance 
or unbalance between the various structures of a social network taken as a group 
of unities (technologies, humans, agents) in dynamic interaction (the character-
istics of an ecosystem).
•	 The analysis of the non-linear dynamic that characterizes the tensegrities.
•	 The challenge of tensegrity for the architects in the industry of construction.
•	 The implications of the training concept associated with the works of the conver-
sation and interaction of actors theory based on the tensegrity theory.
•	 The implications of spatial metaphors in the physical space on the design of 
cognitive spaces and social systems.
•	 Private visualization software (our input)
•	 The relevancy of these fields, examined by Judge:
–– For the new governance forms (2008a) that it would allow to analyse and model
–– For the observation of new forms of organization in which cybernetics of third 
order is considered as significant (2007)
12.1  Towards a Universal Generic Visual Language Model

–– For the emergence and support of new forms of virtual organization within 
social networks and video game environment, regarding their potential for the 
rapid cognitive mastery of a phenomenon and their dynamic development
–– To encourage their use where the issue of intelligence and collective and 
collaborative imagination is important (2005)
–– For the cognitive relevancy of the spherical metaphor applied to various 
modes of dialogue (2011, 1998), in the organization of knowledge (1994), in 
learning spaces and problem-solving (1996)
What are the relevant functionalities of the Stella visualization software 
(Webb 2000) in various fields of interest for the DSS design and implantation? 
In the following lines, we will briefly examine these functions while underlining 
that other types of modules and visualization devices could be evaluated in the same 
spirit. Here are a few schematic comments on the Stella functionalities likely to 
improve the mnemonic function which could be very relevant in institutional design 
and varied strategic situations for the following purposes:
•	 Select/deselect: The polyhedrons’ faces and edges could be selected indepen-
dently for subsequent operations.
•	 Mapping 2D/3D networks: The polyhedrons and visual languages can be rep-
resented as solid 3D forms; we can pivot and move from left to right and top 
to bottom. The 2D networks can represent all sorts of network structures and 
relations. These two representation modes can be combined by modifying the 
window or the interface.
•	 Use colour: A complete colour spectrum like the universal spectrum of traffic 
lights can serve to distinguish values, interests, opinions or attitudes, in accor-
dance with different schemes of information qualification.
•	 Choose images: The application of images at various faces of the polyhedron is 
excellent in various applications like Stella. We can represent:
–– The logos of the organizations collaborating in a coalition of design partners
–– The portrait of the representatives, stakeholders, sponsors and collaborators 
involved in the planning of a collective project
–– The portrait of the organization members, contacts and friends in a collabora-
tive network like it is the case in several current social networks
–– The portrait of the participants and the facilitator of a workshop
•	 These functionalities are only a small example of the basic possibilities offered 
for any Web page relevant for a project and that allows to represent different orga-
nizations or different DSS and explore them with a virtual reality navigator.
•	 Qualify/label: We can convert a text into images or present it under various formats 
and use the rotation function to identify them. Traditional labelling can contain:
–– People (contacts, collaborators, friends, partners)
–– Organizational units, virtual communities, networks and collaborative organi-
zations and various types of DSS
–– Problems and elements of a problem
–– Various planning and community informatics design strategies and the 
properties and components related to them

415
–– The fundamental values of a design project from an ethic chart
–– Multi-aspect and multifunctional dashboards to follow a project
–– Qualitative and quantitative information syntheses
•	 Transform:
–– Structures between them; go from one structure to the other in different ways 
that are useful for a project. To be explored since Stella does not have this 
function.
–– A 2D representation into a 3D representation in order to improve the images 
or diagrams strength to map the strategic challenges of the Quebec digital 
platform. In the context of sustainable development projects, we can also 
capture variables such as P for “population and security”, H for “health and 
well-­being”, L for “learning and education”, C for “commerce and production”, 
E for “environment and impacts” and R for “regulation and norms of equity”.
•	 Capture the various fields of an instantiation strategy and the challenges related to 
the identification of properties and their reciprocal connections in order to make 
decisions that are better founded in a field option or better articulated scenarios.
•	 Use colours, shapes and movement to distinguish the complex arenas and the 
heterogeneous fields in order to discover the models of conduct or behaviour 
considered like “virtual dialogue environments”, where some text or image 
analyses can favour the synthesis, the conciliation of points of view or the mastery 
of a situation’s complexity.
•	 We could continue at length in this direction, and this exercise will be done in our 
future research projects. We simply want to signal here the great possibilities of 
the current visualization tools to better master the collaborative management of 
complex projects. These visualization activities go beyond the information visu-
alization; they expand to all sorts of psychosocial processes while showcasing 
the great importance of this process of information related to community infor-
matics design qualification in connection with the computing possibilities of sev-
eral tools available on the market. For now, we will not go any further in the 
practical aspect of the computerization of this process, because our statement 
could become too technical for the non-expert readers. We will simply identify 
the various possible applications of visual modeling software applied to the DSS.
12.2  The Potential Applications of Visual Modeling 
Languages to the DSS
Let us take, for example, various elements taken from the virtual practice communi-
ties associated with various DSS development strategies.
•	 The integration of virtual teams: One of the possible application fields of languages 
and model visualization is the construction of online teams. One of the important 
theoretical inputs we can refer to is the Stafford Beer one and the “viable systems”. 
12.2  The Potential Applications of Visual Modeling Languages to the DSS

416
The central statement in this application is constituted by the creation of social 
structures based on 3D tools to validate the socio-­organizational characters or 
roles, compatible or not (Beer 1985; Espejo and Harnden 1989).
•	 The social networking: An important variant of the previous application is an 
extension of the fields of the media and social networks, considering the current 
interest for the validation of visualization and conceptual mapping of the social 
networks that currently have the shape of friend networks and personal contacts 
or family networks. The question is if more coherent commitment and participa-
tion structures, based on a suitable suite of 2D and 3D visual interfaces, can serve 
as catalysers or DSS organization models. This could be the proof that this type 
of tool represents an additional option to master the complexity of great projects 
as a complement to lists of partners belonging to different networks we can clas-
sify by name, activity type, in any relevant order or from criteria serving to build 
an analysis chart or a discovery matrix. Furthermore, one of the main reasons to 
favour such computing development is beyond the simple list of names or roles, 
and from the works related to the construction of discovery matrices, we can 
discover new qualities and important characteristics on the relations between 
stakeholders, so many elements are taken into account in the construction of 
practice communities associated with the development of a DSS dedicated to 
innovation. This exercise could be a big step towards taking into account the 
various qualities and values more or less visible or tangible associated with the 
development of more coherent or performing communities.
•	 The online games guilds: Another favoured application of the visualization use 
and various modes of activity representation and design process is the guilds 
(practice communities, associations, circles, tribes) that are devoted to collabora-
tive design and online interactive games management. We especially think about 
the design situations that have hidden aspects, secrets, badly mastered because 
they contain intangible coherence and cohesion factors that would be relevant to 
discover in order to guide certain activities. Analysis observation and evaluation 
charts which allow to better understand the structuring and operating of the 
online gaming communities could constitute a fundamental input to evaluate the 
strategies and offer competitive benefits. In this esprit, the growing overlap 
between strategic simulations and electronic scenarios of a game could offer in a 
few years a mastery of a more suitable complexity by revealing the “secrets” of 
all sorts of training strategies in various fields like health, education and the envi-
ronment, which could lead to the success of reality in these activities fields.
•	 The research colabs, the living labs, the excellency centres and collaborative 
research networks: Because of the transdisciplinary challenges such DSS design 
environment pose, sociometric mapping and the schematization of various 
design processes or playful activities through 2D and 3D visualization tools, 
under various forms of “organized complexity” apprehension, could be fruitful 
in the identification of qualities and factors intervening in the integrative nature 
of such DSS, at their rising stage, their growth or their metamorphosis, dissolu-
tion or access to maturity. We can easily imagine all the utilities of such modeling 
tools can bring to the structuring of excellency centres of the federal government 
or to the Quebec government innovation validation activities.
12  The Conclusion: Towards a Computerized Modeling Tool for a 2MDSAM…

417
•	 Digital social systems: In a more generic way, we consider the mapping of 
stakeholders and the necessary functionalities to meet their expectations (e.g. the 
translation of the discovery matrices results in an evolutive 3D model) through 
various representations and modeling interfaces that can improve in a relevant 
manner the “visualization sense of a group’s integrity”, which could bring a con-
crete and operating complement to the comprehension of the structuring and the 
functioning of these groups. Analysis charts built in groups and mediatized in 3D 
modeling suitable tools would contrast with simplistic diagrams usually used in 
this type of activity, in particular in the communication through social media. In 
particular, we would need suitable analysis and media validation tools to identify 
and characterize the levels of additional complexity to take into account to 
improve the efficiency of the virtual work teams and online training. Beyond the 
psychosocial analysis, the real interest of using modeling tools resides in the pos-
sibilities offered by a series of “visual and design interaction models” that could 
constitute a sort of “visual mirror” of the directory of strategies useful for design, 
the implantation and the deployment of DSS, especially in the competitive ubiq-
uitous contexts. Another advanced possibility would be two innovation commu-
nities wanting to create a collaborative network that could visualize their 
interrelations around the same models.
•	 The relations complementarity and unbalance: Another functionality of the DSS 
co-construction and innovation communities is the development of stakeholder 
communities in terms of coalition and strategic alliance between multiple partners 
where we must ensure the required variety of elements and complementary com-
ponents (people, organizations, technological resources, design strategies, shared 
values concepts or functionalities). The possibility to identify symmetries and 
differences offered by different types of interfaces like Stella could help distin-
guish even more the elements of a field (cognitive, social, legal aspects), its mul-
tiple aspects, its properties and their relations and connections, through colours, 
shapes or movement. The use of this grammar of the 3D image applied to the 
mediatization of the strategic alignment and discovery matrices results could also 
greatly help showcase the potential unbalance between stakeholders.
•	 Mapping and coding of socio-communicational functionalities: Beyond the quan-
tification of more measurable objects (like socio-demographic aspects, degrees of 
ICT appropriation or the attitudes ladder), the value of 3D modeling software’s 
language models could be clearly associated with their “cognitive qualitative 
meaning”, which could be usefully mapped in different aspects of a design strat-
egy (exostructure, endostructure, community informatics design activities, com-
municational structures and processes, functionalities, socio-­technologies, ethics 
and values) in a way to showcase the convergences and divergences, contrasts and 
complementarities in the various relations and connections between stakeholders. 
This could be useful in the exploratory activities related to spaces 1 and 2 of the 
seven spiral design spaces, in the exploration of a common vision, or even in the 
simulation of context more favourable to action, for a small interest group or a 
large innovation community. It could also be the development of a communica-
tional or educational device, the symbolic comprehension of a project and the 
monitoring of the members’ perceptions dealing with a complex activity. 
12.2  The Potential Applications of Visual Modeling Languages to the DSS

418
The projections and the imagination of a new virtual territory scope are directed 
towards the desired and desirable values. In its more obvious shape, the visualiza-
tion of complex systems issues resides in the identification and informational 
typologies and the distinction of psychosocial functionalities specific to a design 
project, whether it is values or principles that guide activities, action and interven-
tion programs, quantities, qualities or properties associated with various fields to 
be modeled or developed. If the presentation of a series of element list by fields, 
accompanied by their discovery matrix process, represents an important step in 
the more systematic DSS design, we should consider the connections between 
these series of elements more. The visualization of these connections and their 
operating arrangements for the planning can be of a considerable importance for 
the rigor, the integrity and the viability when we try to apply them to design 
situations. The example of vast social systems like the healthcare system in 
Quebec illustrates the arrangement of elements often disparate and badly pro-
cessed, like documents, reports, articles and policies not considered in a holistic 
manner. The dynamic conceptual mapping of systems and subsystems of activi-
ties could contribute to ask better research and development questions when the 
observation of complex reports between elements is done in a more systematic 
way, through the discovery and representation of interaction models and graphic 
design. In our case, the community informatics field, the particular interest resides 
in the series of aspects and modeled fields we have identified and defined in an 
entire instantiation strategy by trying to reduce the numerous fields to seven great 
types (exostructure, endostructure, etc.) to make the typology of their elements as 
a checklist in order to appreciate the connections and arrangements through 
discovery matrices with the objective of computationally translating them in 
visual languages with two, three, four or even more dimensions.
12.3  Future Researches
The use of the entire community informatics design methodology supported by new 
modes of visual representations will be the topic of our next works on complex 
social systems governance, in particular we are thinking of: the empowerment of the 
civil society in design problematics, the organizational transformation through the 
co-creation of many kinds of digital design platforms, the perspectives opened by 
the proliferation of all kinds of computerized artwork and visualization tools and 
their related cognitive issues, the overcoming of obstacles and the resolutions of 
conflicting worldview, the results of consensus building in conversational work-
shops, the assessment of psychosocial impacts of various modes of dialogue and the 
responsible communication at the service of innovation ecosystems and sustainable 
digital social systems.
The ubiquitous imagination in a complex design world is only the beginning. 
The concrete FOSM contribution to community informatics design and the 
2MDSAM in the apprehension and implantation of DSS systems has yet to be

419
proven. We would need several important socio-technical projects to validate their 
foundations, their theories, their methodologies and their applications. Even if we 
believe that the conceptual scaffolding, reference framework and instantiation 
strategies presented in this book are sufficient to describe several complex social 
systems of interest for our society, we do not know yet if the seven design spaces 
and the seven fields of modeling presented represent a design methodology suitable 
for the DSS development and, if so, to what extent. In particular, we need to better 
define the fields of exostructure, design processes and applied ethics.
Important researches have started and are realized everyday in the world in order 
to explore the interactions between several socio-technical systems of human activi-
ties. To move towards more rigorous approaches in the comprehension and implan-
tation of these systems, we shall create “design and knowledge catalysers” like the 
SADC and 2MDSAM, to be able to represent complex ecosystems where each of 
the systems or subsystems interacts with the exostructure or the endostructure of the 
other. The first apprehended results of these researches, combining complexity sci-
ences, computing and social and communicational sciences, already promise the 
discovery of unexpected facts with an organizational behaviour we badly master 
and with governance modes and integration mechanisms we do not explore enough 
in the context of disparate and diversified social systems.
We believe the conceptual model presented in this book, with its methodology, 
as well as our first APSI research results on the social appropriation of methodolo-
gies and design collaborative tools will contribute to improve the existing systems 
but also to provoke the appearance of a strong social interest for modeling and the 
implantation of social systems that will be more favourable in the future. They pro-
vide a wider model to scientifically and methodologically represent socio-technical 
systems we call digital social systems. The invaluable free open-source code 
software input frees the imagination for a new movement of “design thinking” free 
of the limits provided by the use of private software. This movement makes possible 
a larger amount of programming and modeling systems that, once integrated in an 
analytical framework and a semiformal instantiation methodology, promise us 
social systems that will accompany human activities in all sorts of socio-economic 
activities spheres.
Finally, the heaviest task consists of developing partners’ commitment and 
implantation strategies especially at the level of future research policies. The data 
visualization strategies and the development of exhaustive criteria in order to deter-
mine when and how the modeling of complex social systems should be applied here 
are research subjects really worth exploring.
The FOSM, community informatics design and its seven exploratory spaces as 
well as the 2MDSAM now allow users/designers, expert or not, to reflect and repre-
sent each scientific block of socio-technical systems design and the fields associated 
to them. Users can contribute to map the interactions within and between these 
fields as well as to “configure” their relations and connections through discovery 
matrix and modeling tools. They can also represent the DSS evolution through time 
and their various states of transition, in terms of structure – evolution of the knots 
and relations between fields – and the properties of elements and components of 
12.3  Future Researches

420
various aspects of the systems to build. The approach is systematic enough to be 
programmable and translated into visualization tools with n dimensions to assist 
various users/designers audiences. From qualification of information and knowledge, 
we come back to a quantification that will also command and new qualification, 
according to fields and never-ending knots of the global scientific conversation.
Finally, the FOSM of community informatics design, its seven design spaces and 
the 2MDSAM allow us to process for the first time, in a unified manner, social inter-
actions and techniques in the context of the social Web under construction. This will 
allow us to direct the ubiquitous imagination and the participative culture of users 
towards the construction of DSS, innovation communities and social networks at 
the service of our society’s development and to study them with the bets theoretical, 
methodological and technological tools.
