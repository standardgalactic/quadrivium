xii     Samsung Galaxy S7 For Dummies

Introduction     1
Introduction
T
he Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are powerful smartphones, perhaps the 
most powerful mobile phones ever sold. As of the publication of this book, 
the Galaxy S7s are the standard against which all other Android-based 
phones are measured.
Each cellular carrier offers a slightly customized version of the Galaxy S7 line-up. 
Some phones from cellular carriers come out of the box with preloaded applica-
tions, games, or files. Some come with accessories, such as a corded headset; 
­others don’t. This book doesn’t dwell on these kinds of differences.
The name for each network is different, these phones are largely the same. (At 
least one marketing person at each cellular carrier is cringing as you read this.) 
This similarity allows me to write this book in a way that covers the common 
capabilities.
At a more core level, these phones are built for high-speed wireless communi-
cations. The cellular carriers have spent kajillions upgrading their networks to 
offer more coverage and better data speeds than their competition. Again, this 
book doesn’t dwell on these differences in network technology because they don’t 
really make much difference. (Again, at least one engineering person at each 
­cellular carrier is cringing as you read this.)
Similarly, most of the capabilities of the Galaxy S7 Edge, with the cool curved 
screen, and the Galaxy S7 with the cool flat screen, are identical. Some apps take 
advantage of the S7 Edge’s ability to display content when the phone is lying flat. 
Most apps do not. When there is an important distinction between the S7 and the 
S7 Edge, I will mention it. Otherwise, I will just call the phone the Galaxy S7.
I assume that you already have a Galaxy S7, and I just hope that you have good 
coverage where you spend more of your time with your phone. If so, you’ll be 
fine. If not, you need to switch to another network; otherwise, the experience 
with your phone will be frustrating. I would advise you to return your phone to 
that carrier and buy your Galaxy S7 at another cellular carrier. As long as you 
have good ­cellular data coverage, owning a Samsung Galaxy S7 will be an exciting 
experience!

2     Samsung Galaxy S7 For Dummies
First, in much the same way that different brands of PCs are all based on the Micro-
soft Windows operating system, all Galaxy S phones use the Google Android plat-
form. The good news is that the Android platform has proven to be widely popular, 
even more successful than Google originally expected when it first announced 
Android in November 2007. More people are using Android-based phones, and 
more third parties are writing applications. This is good news because it offers you 
more options for applications (more on this in Chapter 8 on the Play Store, where 
you buy applications).
In addition, all Galaxy S7 phones use a powerful graphics processor, employ 
­Samsung’s Super AMOLED touchscreen, and are covered in Corning’s Gorilla 
Glass. The superior screen experience differentiates this product line from other 
Android phones. Because of these enhanced capabilities, you can navigate around 
the screen with multi-touch screen gestures instead of the hierarchical menus 
found on lesser Android phones. Plus, the videos look stunning from many angles.
Smartphones are getting smarter all the time, and the Galaxy S7 is one of the 
smartest. However, just because you’ve used a smartphone in the past doesn’t 
mean you should expect to use your new Galaxy S7 without a bit of guidance.
You may not be familiar with using a multi-touch screen, and your new phone 
offers a lot of capabilities that you may or may not be familiar with. It would be 
unfortunate to find out from a kid in the neighborhood that the phone you’ve been 
carrying around for several months could solve a problem you’ve been having 
because you were never told that the solution was in your pocket the whole time.
In fact, Samsung is proud of the usability of its entire Galaxy line-up — and 
proud that the user’s manual is really just a quick start guide. You can find lots of 
instructions on the web. However, you have to know what you don’t know to get 
what you want unless you plan to view every tutorial.
That’s where this book comes in. This book is a hands-on guide to getting the 
most out of your Galaxy S7.
About This Book
This book is a reference — you don’t have to read it from beginning to end to get 
all you need out of it. The information is clearly organized and easy to access. You 
don’t need thick glasses to understand this book. This book helps you figure out 
what you want to do — and then tells you how to do it in plain English.

Introduction     3
I don’t use many conventions in this book, but here are a few you should know 
about:
»
» Whenever I introduce a new term, I put it in italics and define it shortly 
thereafter.
»
» I use bold for the action parts of numbered steps, so you can easily see what 
you’re supposed to do.
»
» I use monofont for web addresses and email addresses, so they stand out 
from the surrounding text. If you’re reading this as an e-book, these links are 
live and clickable. Note: When this book was printed, some web addresses 
may have needed to break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest 
assured that we haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indi-
cate the break. So, when using one of these web addresses, just type exactly 
what you see in this book, pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
I think you’ll find every last word of this book scintillating, but I may be a little 
biased. The truth is, you don’t have to read
»
» Sidebars: Sidebars are those gray boxes throughout the book. They’re inter-
esting, but not essential to the topic at hand, so if you’re short on time (or you 
want only the information you absolutely need), you can skip them.
»
» Text marked with the Technical Stuff icon: For more on this icon, see the 
“Icons Used in This Book” section, later in this Introduction.
Foolish Assumptions
You know what they say about assuming, so I don’t do much of it in this book. But 
I do make a few assumptions about you:
»
» You have a Galaxy S7 phone. You may be thinking about buying a Galaxy 
S7 phone, but my money’s on your already owning one. After all, getting your 
hands on the phone is the best part!

4     Samsung Galaxy S7 For Dummies
»
» You’re not totally new to mobile phones. You know that your Galaxy S7 
phone is capable of doing more than the average phone, and you’re eager to 
find out what your phone can do.
»
» You’ve used a computer. You don’t have to be a computer expert, but you at 
least know how to check your email and surf the web.
How This Book Is Organized
The 18 chapters in this book are divided into six parts. Here’s what you can find 
in each part.
Part 1: Getting Started with  
the Samsung Galaxy S7
The first part of this book gets you familiar with the basic capabilities of your 
Galaxy S7 phone. Chapters 1 and 2 are an introduction to everything from turning 
it on and off to managing battery life.
Part 2: Communications
In this part, I walk you through the basic capabilities of the Galaxy S7 for commu­
nicating with voice, texts, and email. Chapter 3 is about making calls. Chapter 4 
covers what you need to know about texting. Chapter  5 covers emailing, and 
Chapter 6 explores how the phone works with your Contacts database.
Part 3: Live on the Internet: Going Mobile
This part is all about the Internet — how to access it from your Galaxy S7 phone. 
I also introduce you to the Play Store, where you can trick out your phone with 
more apps.
Part 4: Entertainment Applications
An important use for many smartphone owners involves entertainment. Chapter 9 
­covers the impressive picture-taking capabilities of your phone, but really covers 
only some of the capabilities. Chapter 10 looks at the impressive gaming capa-
bilities; Chapter 11 explores navigating to all the fun places you can go in the real 
world; and Chapter 12 walks you through playing music and video on your phone.

Introduction     5
Part 5: Productivity Applications
In this part, I cover the capabilities of the Galaxy S7 smartphone that make you 
more productive at home and work.
Part 6: The Part of Tens
This wouldn’t be a For Dummies book without a Part of Tens. In this book, the Part 
of Tens covers ten ways to customize the phone to make it truly your own, how 
to keep your information safe, and ten capabilities to look for in future releases.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, I used icons (little pictures in the margin) to draw your 
attention to various types of information. Here’s a key to what those icons mean:
This whole book is like one big series of tips. When I share especially useful tips 
and tricks, I mark them with the Tip icon.
This book is a reference, which means you don’t have to commit it to memory — 
there is no test at the end. But once in a while, I do tell you things that are so 
important that I think you should remember them, and when I do, I mark them 
with the Remember icon.
Whenever you may do something that could cause a major headache, I warn you 
with the, er, Warning icon.
These sections provide a little more information than is necessary to use your 
phone. The hope is that these sections convey extra knowledge to help you under-
stand what is going on when things go wrong, or at least differently than you 
might have expected.
Beyond the Book
In addition to what you’re reading right now, this product also comes with a 
free access-anywhere Cheat Sheet. To get to this Cheat Sheet, simply go to www. 
dummies.com and search for “Samsung Galaxy S7 Cheat Sheet” in the Search box.

Where to Go from Here
You don’t have to read this book from cover to cover. You can skip around as you 
like. For example, if you need the basics on calling, texting, and emailing, turn to 
Part 2. To discover more about photos, games, and apps, go to Part 4. To find out 
about the phone’s calendar functions or about using the Microsoft Office, turn to 
Part 5.
Many readers are already somewhat familiar with smartphones and won’t need 
the basic information found in Parts 1 and 2. A reasonably astute mobile phone 
user can figure out how to use the phone, text, and data capabilities. Parts 1 and 2 
are not for those readers. For them, I recommend skipping ahead to the chapters 
in Parts 3 through 6.
Former iPhone users, on the other hand, are a special case. (First, welcome to the 
world of Android!) The reality is that the iPhone and Galaxy S series have very 
similar capabilities, but these functions are just done in slightly different ways 
and emphasize different approaches to the similar problems. iPhone users, don’t 
worry if you find that this book spends a fair amount of time explaining capabili-
ties with which you’re familiar. You can read through those chapters quickly, focus 
on the how instead of the description of what, and bypass potential frustration.
Current Samsung Galaxy S6 users are also a special case. The Samsung Galaxy S7 
is very similar to the Galaxy S6 in many ways. Galaxy S7 operates mostly like the 
S6, but has improvements in usability, power consumption, and performance. If 
you’re comfortable with the Galaxy S6 and now have a Galaxy S7, Chapters 15 and 
beyond would be of interest to you.
The majority of readers of this book are actually very astute and get the fact that 
this book covers the basics of using the Samsung Galaxy S7. A subset of readers 
complain in Internet reviews that a For Dummies book is too basic. If you do this, 
people will know that you did not read the title. Be sure to read the title and avoid 
public embarrassment.

hether you want just the basics from a mobile phone (make and take 
phone calls, customize your ringtone, take some pictures, maybe use a 
Bluetooth headset) or you want your phone to be always by your side 
(a tool for multiple uses throughout your day), you can make that happen. In this 
chapter, I outline all the things your Samsung Galaxy S7 can do — from the basics 
to what makes Galaxy S7 phones different from the rest.
Discovering the Basics of Your Phone
All mobile phones on the market today include basic functions, and even some 
entry-level phones are a little more sophisticated. Of course, Samsung includes 
all basic functions on the Galaxy S7 model. In addition to making and taking calls 
Chapter 1

10     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
(see Chapter 3) and sending and receiving texts (see Chapter 4), the Galaxy S7 
sports the following basic features:
»
» 12MP digital camera: This resolution is more than enough for posting good-
quality images on the Internet and even having 8 x 10-inch prints made. There 
is also a front-facing camera that is useful for videoconference calls.
»
» Ringtones: You can replace the standard ringtone with custom ringtones that 
you download to your phone. You also can specify different rings for different 
numbers.
»
» Bluetooth: The Galaxy S7 phone supports stereo and standard Bluetooth 
devices. (See Chapter 3 for more on Bluetooth.)
»
» High-resolution screen: The Galaxy S7 phone offers one of the highest- 
resolution touchscreens on the market (2,560 x 1,440 pixels).
»
» Capacitive touchscreen: The Galaxy S7 phone offers a very slick touchscreen 
that’s sensitive enough to allow you to interact with the screen accurately, but 
not so sensitive that it’s hard to manage. In addition, it has an optional setting 
that steps up the sensitivity for special circumstances, like when you want to 
use one hand!
Taking Your Phone to the Next Level:  
The Smartphone Features
In addition to the basic capabilities of any entry-level phone, the Galaxy S7, which 
is based on the popular Android platform for mobile devices, has capabilities asso-
ciated with other smartphones, such as the Apple iPhone and the phones based on 
the Windows Phone 8 operating system:
»
» Internet access: Access websites through a web browser on your phone.
»
» Photos: The Galaxy S7 comes with a very intelligent camera that has millions 
of combinations of settings, filters, and resolutions and also has the capability 
to manage photos.
»
» Wireless email: Send and receive email from your phone.
»
» Multimedia: Play music and videos on your phone.
»
» Contact Manager: The Galaxy S7 lets you take shortcuts that save you from 
having to enter someone’s ten-digit number each time you want to call or 
text a friend. In fact, the Contact Manager can track all the numbers that an 

CHAPTER 1  Exploring What You Can Do with Your Phone     11
individual might have, store an email address and photo for the person, and 
synchronize with the program you use for managing contacts on both your 
personal and work PCs!
»
» Digital camcorder: The Galaxy S7 comes with a built-in digital camcorder that 
records live video at a resolution that you can set, including UHD (ultra-high 
definition, which is just now becoming available on the newest televisions).
»
» Mapping and directions: The Galaxy S7 uses GPS (Global Positioning System) 
in your phone to tell you where you are, find local services that you need, and 
give you directions to where you want to go.
»
» Fitness information: The Galaxy S7 automatically tracks important health 
information within the phone and with external sensors.
»
» Business applications: The Galaxy S7 can keep you productive while you’re 
away from the office.
I go into each of these capabilities in greater detail in the following sections.
Internet access
Until a few years ago, the only way to access the Internet when you were away 
from a desk was with a laptop. Smartphones are a great alternative to laptops 
because they’re small, convenient, and ready to launch their web browsers right 
away. Even more important, when you have a smartphone, you can access the 
Internet wherever you are — whether Wi-Fi is available or not.
The drawback to smartphones, however, is that their screen size is smaller than 
that of even the most basic laptop. On the Galaxy S7 phone, you can use the stan-
dard version of a website if you want. You can pinch and stretch your way to get 
the information you want. (See Chapter 2 for more information on pinching and 
stretching. For more information on accessing the Internet from your Galaxy S7 
phone, turn to Chapter 7.)
To make things a bit easier, many popular websites offer an easier-to-use app 
that you can download and install on your phone. This is discussed in detail in 
Chapter 8. Essentially, the website reformats the information from the site so that 
it’s easier to read and navigate in the mobile environment. Figure 1-1 compares a 
regular website with the app version of that website.
Photos
The image application on your phone helps you use the digital camera on your 
Galaxy S7 phone to its full potential. (It would almost make sense to call the 
­Samsung Galaxy S7 a smartcamera with a built-in phone!)

12     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
Studies have found that cellphone users tend to snap a bunch of pictures within 
the first month of phone usage. After that, the photos sit on the phone (instead of 
being downloaded to a computer), and the picture-taking rate drops dramatically.
The Galaxy S7 image management application is different. You can integrate your 
camera images into your home photo library, as well as photo-sharing sites such 
as Picasa and Flickr, with minimal effort.
For more on how to use the Photo applications, turn to Chapter 9.
Wireless email
On your Galaxy S7 smartphone, you can access your business and personal email 
accounts, reading and sending email messages on the go. Depending on your 
email system, you might be able to sync so that when you delete an email on your 
phone, the email is deleted on your computer at the same time so that you don’t 
have to read the same messages on your phone and your computer.
Chapter 5 covers setting up your business and personal email accounts.
FIGURE 1-1:

and the app 
version of the 
main site.

CHAPTER 1  Exploring What You Can Do with Your Phone     13
Multimedia
Some smartphones allow you to play music and videos on your phone in place of a 
dedicated MP3 or video player. On the Galaxy S7, you can use the applications that 
come with the phone, or you can download applications that offer these capabili-
ties from the Play Store.
Chapter 12 covers how to use the multimedia services with your Galaxy S7 phone.
Business applications
Whether your company gives you a Galaxy S7 phone for work or you buy your 
Galaxy S7 phone yourself, you can use the Galaxy S7 to work with Microsoft Office 
applications.
Chapter 14 explores how to set up your phone to work with Microsoft Office appli-
cations. After you set it up, you’ll have unprecedented access to your calendar.
Customizing Your Phone with  
Games and Applications
Application developers — large and small — are working on the Android platform 
to offer a variety of applications and games for the Galaxy S7 phone. Compared 
to most of the other smartphone platforms, Google imposes fewer restrictions on 
application developers regarding what’s allowable. This freedom to develop reso-
nates with many developers — resulting in a bonanza of application development 
on this platform.
As of this writing, more than one million applications are available from Google’s 
Play Store. For more information about downloading games and applications, turn 
to Chapter 8.
Downloading games
Chapter  10 of this book is for gamers. Although your phone comes with a few 
general-interest games, you can find a whole wide world of games for every skill 
and taste. In Chapter 10, I give you all the information you need to set up differ-
ent gaming experiences. Whether you prefer stand-alone games or multiplayer 
games, you can set up your Galaxy S7 phone to get what you need.

14     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
Downloading applications
Your phone comes with some very nice applications, but these might not take 
you as far as you want to go. You might also have some special interests, such as 
philately or stargazing, that neither Samsung nor your carrier felt would be of 
sufficient general interest to include on the phone. (Can you imagine?)
Your phone also comes with preloaded widgets, which are smaller applications that 
serve particular purposes, such as retrieving particular stock quotes or telling you 
how your phone’s battery is feeling today. Widgets reside on the extended Home 
screen and are instantly available.
Buying applications allows you to get additional capabilities quickly, easily, and 
inexpensively. Ultimately, these make your phone, which is already a reflection of 
who you are, even more personal as you add more capabilities.
What’s cool about the Android platform
The Samsung Galaxy S7 is the top-of-the-line Android phone. That means you 
can run any application developed for an Android phone to its full capability. This 
is significant because one of the founding principles behind the Android platform 
is to create an environment where application developers can be as creative as 
possible without an oppressive organization dictating what can and cannot be sold 
(as long as it’s within the law, of course). This creative elbow room has inspired 
many of the best application developers to go with Android first.
TAKE A DEEP BREATH
You don’t have to rush to implement every feature of your Galaxy S7 phone the very 
first day you get it. Instead, pick one capability at a time. Digest it, enjoy it, and then 
tackle the next one.
I recommend starting with setting up your email and social accounts, but that’s just me.
No matter how you tackle the process of setting up your Galaxy S7 phone, it’ll take 
some time. If you try to cram it all in on the first day, you’ll turn what should be fun into 
drudgery.
The good news is that you own the book that takes you through the process. You can 
do a chapter or two at a time.

CHAPTER 1  Exploring What You Can Do with Your Phone     15
In addition, Android is designed to run multiple applications at once. Other smart-
phone platforms have added this capability, but Android is designed to let you to 
jump quickly among the multiple apps that you’re running — which makes your 
smartphone experience that much smoother.
Surviving Unboxing Day
When you turn on your phone the first time, it will ask you a series of ten ques-
tions and preferences to configure it. Frankly, they are trying to make this book 
unnecessary and put me out of business. The nerve!
The good folks at Samsung are well-intentioned, but not every customer who 
owns a Samsung Galaxy S7 knows, from day one, whether he or she wants a 
­Samsung account, what’s a good name for the phone, or what the purpose of a 
cloud service, such as Dropbox, is and how it would be used.
WHAT IF I DIDN’T GET MY PHONE  
FROM A CELLULAR COMPANY?
With a few exceptions, such as an “unlocked” GSM phone, each phone is associated with 
a particular cellular company. (In this context, a locked phone can work only on its origi-
nal carrier.) Maybe you bought a secondhand phone on eBay, or you got a phone from 
a friend who didn’t want his anymore. If you didn’t get your phone directly from a cellu-
lar provider, you will need to figure out which provider the phone is associated with and 
get a service plan from that company. Some Galaxy S7 phones sold in the United States 
all have the cellular company’s logo on the phone printed on the front. That makes it 
easy to know under which carrier a phone will operate.
If there’s no logo on the front, you’ll have to figure out which cellular carrier it can work 
with. The quickest way is to take the phone to any cellular store; the folks there know 
how to figure it out.
To narrow down the possibilities on your own, you need to do some investigation. Take 
off the back of the phone to find the plate with the model and serial number for the 
phone. If you see IMEI on the plate, the phone is based on a technology called Global 
System for Mobile (GSM); it’ll work with AT&T, T-Mobile, MetroPCS (or all of them). If you 
see ESN on the plate, the phone will work with Verizon, Sprint, or US Cellular.

16     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
You can relax. I’ll help you answer these questions — or, when appropriate, refer 
you to the chapter in this book that helps you come up with your answer.
On the other hand, if your phone is already set up, you probably took a guess or 
skipped some questions. Maybe now you’re rethinking some of your choices. No 
problem. You can go back and change any answer you gave and get your phone to 
behave the way you want.
The following are the kinds of questions you may be asked. These questions may 
come in this order, but they may not. They typically include the following:
»
» Language/Accessibility: This option lets you select your language. The 
default is English for phones sold within the United States. Also, the phone has 
some special capabilities for individuals with disabilities. If you have a disabil-
ity and think you might benefit, take a look at these options. They have really 
tried to make this phone as usable as possible for as many folks as possible.
»
» Wi-Fi: Your phone automatically starts scanning for a Wi-Fi connection. You 
can always use the cellular connection when you are in cellular coverage, but 
if there is a Wi-Fi connection available, your phone will try to use this first. It is 
probably cheaper and may be faster than the cellular.
At the same time, you may not want your phone to connect to the Wi-Fi access 
point with the best signal. It could be that the strongest signal is a fee-based 
service, whereas the next best signal is free. In any case, this page scans the 
available options and presents them to you.
»
» Date and Time: This is easy. The default setting is to use the time and date 
that comes from the cellular network and the date and time format is the 
U.S. style. Just tap on the next button and move on. This date and time from 
the cellular network is the most accurate information you’ll get, and you don’t 
need to do anything other than be within cellular coverage now and again. If 
you prefer non-U.S. formatting, such as a 24-hour clock or day/month/year 
formatting, you can change your phone any way you want.
»
» Sign up for a Samsung Account: Go ahead and sign up for an account. The 
Samsung account offers you some nice things to help you get your phone 
back should you lose it. All you need is an account name, such as an email 
account, and a password.
When you buy a Galaxy S7 smartphone, you are now a customer of multiple 
companies! These include Samsung for the phone hardware, Google for the 
phone operating system (Android), and the wireless carrier that provides the 
cellular service. Plus, if you bought the phone through a phone retailer, such 
as Best Buy, it is in the mix as well. All of them want to make you happy, which 
is a good thing for the most part. The only downside is that they want to know

CHAPTER 1  Exploring What You Can Do with Your Phone     17
who you are so that they can provide you with more services. Don’t worry. 
You control how much they offer you.
»
» Google Account Sign-up: Google account means an email account where the 
address ends in @gmail.com. If you already have an account on Gmail, enter 
your user ID and password here. If you don’t have a Gmail account, I suggest 
waiting until you read Chapter 5. I highly recommend that you create a Gmail 
account, but there are some considerations on selecting a good name. If you 
are game, pick a name for your Gmail account now. Otherwise, it can wait 
until you read Chapter 5.
»
» Location Options: Your phone knowing your location and providing it to an 
application can be sensitive issue.
If you’re really worried about privacy and security, tap the green check marks 
on the screen and then tap the button that says Next. Selecting these options 
prevents applications from knowing where you are. (This choice also prevents 
you from getting directions and a large number of cool capabilities that are 
built into applications.) The only folks who’ll know your location will be the 911 
dispatchers if you dial them.
If you’re worried about your security but want to take advantage of some of 
the cool capabilities built into your phone, tap the right arrow key to move for-
ward. Remember, you can choose on a case-by-case basis whether to share 
your location. (I cover this issue in Chapter 8.)
»
» Phone Ownership: This screen asks you to enter your first and last name. Go 
ahead and put in your real name. If you want to know more, read Chapter 5.
»
» Cloud Services: The chances are that you will be offered the option to sign 
up for a cloud service where you can back up your phone and get access to 
a gazillion MB of free storage. This can be a tricky decision. You could sign up 
for every cloud service that comes along. Then you need to remember where 
you stored that critical file. You could sign up for one, and you may miss a nice 
capability that is available on another. You could have one cloud service for 
work and another for personal. Here is what I recommend: Sign up for what-
ever is the cloud service your phone offers during this initial setup process 
if you do not already have one. You will see what it is later. If you are happy 
with a cloud service you already have, such as Dropbox or OneDrive, chances 
are, they will have all the services you need for you and your phone. You can 
link your Galaxy S7 to this service by downloading the necessary app (which I 
cover how to do in Chapter 8).
»
» Learn about Key Features: If you think you don’t need this book, go ahead 
and take this tour of all the new things you can do. If you think you might need 
this book in any way, shape, or form, tap the Next button. This screen is for 
setting up the coolest and the most sophisticated capabilities of the phone. 
I cover many of them in this book. For now, skip this to get to the last screen.

»
» Device Name: When this screen comes up, you’ll see a text box that has the 
model name. You can keep this name for your phone, or you can choose to 
personalize it a bit. For example, you can change it to “Bill’s Galaxy S7” or “Indy 
at 425-555-1234.” The purpose of this name is for connecting to a local data 
network, as when you’re pairing to a Bluetooth device. If this last sentence 
made no sense to you, don’t worry about it. (I go over all of this in Chapter 3.) 
Tap Finish. In a moment, you see the Home screen, as shown in Figure 1-2.

n this chapter, I fill you in on the basics of using your new Samsung Galaxy 
S7. You start by turning on your phone. (I told you I was covering the basics!) 
I guide you through charging your phone and getting the most out of your 
phone’s battery. Stick with me for a basic tour of your phone’s buttons and other 
features. Then I end by telling you how to turn off your phone or put it in “sleep” 
mode.
Unless you’re new to mobile phones in general — and smartphones in particular — 
you might want to skip this chapter. If the term “smartphone” is foreign to you, 
you probably haven’t used one before, and reading this chapter won’t hurt. And, 
just so you know, a smartphone is just a mobile phone on which you can download 
and run applications that are better than what comes preloaded on a phone right 
out of the box.
First Things First: Turning On Your Phone
When you open the box of your new phone, the packaging will present you with 
your phone, wrapped in plastic, readily accessible. If you haven’t already, take the 
phone out of the box and remove any protective covering material on the screen. 
(There is no need to keep the plastic. It is not an effective screen protector!)

First things first. The Power button is on the right side of the phone. You can 
see where in Figure 2-1. Press the Power button for a second and see whether 
it vibrates and the screen lights up. Hopefully, your phone arrived with enough 
electrical charge that you won’t have to plug it into an outlet right away. You can 
enjoy your new phone for the first day without having to charge it.
FIGURE 2-1: 
The Power 
button on the 
Galaxy S7.

CHAPTER 2  Beginning at the Beginning     21
The phones that you get at the stores of most cellular carriers usually come with 
the battery installed, partially charged, and registered with the network.
If the screen does light up, don’t hold the Power button too long, or the phone 
might turn off.
If the phone screen doesn’t light up (rats!), you need to charge the battery. Here’s 
the rub: It’s important to fully charge the battery for 24 hours, or at least over-
night, so that it will last as long as possible. That means that you have to wait to 
use your beautiful new phone. Sorry.
THE NITTY-GRITTY OF HOW  
YOUR PHONE WORKS
As soon as you turn on your phone, several things happen. As the phone is powering 
up, it begins transmitting information to (and receiving information from) nearby cellular 
towers. The first information exchanged includes your phone’s electronic serial number. 
Every cellphone has its own unique serial number built into the hardware of the phone; 
the serial number in current-generation cellphones can’t be duplicated or used by any 
other phone.
This electronic serial number is also called an International Mobile Equipment Identity 
(IMEI) number. It is 14 or 15 digits long. Cellular equipment is fine with long numbers. We 
mere mortals have enough trouble remembering 10-digit numbers, even with the hack 
of having only a limited number of area codes. To help us out, you and I get to use the 
shorter number and the cellular equipment happily keeps track of the 10-digit and the 
14/15-digit numbers and shows us only what we can handle.
It doesn’t matter to the phone or the cellular tower if you’re near your home when you 
turn on your phone — and that’s the joy of mobile phones. All cellular networks have 
agreements that allow you to use cellular networks in other parts of the country and, 
sometimes, around the world.
That said, a call outside your cellular provider’s own network may be expensive. Within 
the United States, many service plans allow you to pay the same rate if you use your 
phone anywhere in the United States to call anywhere in the United States. If you travel 
outside the United States, even to Canada, you might end up paying through the nose. 
Remember: Before you leave on a trip, check with your cellular carrier about your rates. 
Even if you travel internationally only a few times yearly, a different service plan may 
work better for you. Your cellular carrier can fill you in on your options.

22     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
Charging Your Phone and  
Managing Battery Life
Although you probably don’t have to plug your phone into an outlet right away, 
here’s a handy rule: The first time you do plug it in, allow it to charge overnight.
You’ll hear all kinds of “battery lore” left over from earlier battery technologies. 
For example, lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries don’t have a “memory” (a bad thing 
for a battery) as nickel-cadmium (NiCad) batteries did. And the Samsung Galaxy 
S7 does use Li-ion batteries. That means that you don’t have to make sure that the 
battery fully discharges before you recharge it.
Your phone comes with a two-piece battery charger (cable and the transformer), 
as shown in Figure 2-2.
The cable has two ends: one end that plugs into the phone, and the other that’s a 
standard USB connector. The phone end is a small connector called a micro-USB 
that is used on many Samsung devices and is the standard for charging cellphones 
and other small electronics — and for connecting them to computers.
FIGURE 2-2: 
The 
­transformer 
and USB cable 
for charging 
your phone.

CHAPTER 2  Beginning at the Beginning     23
To charge the phone, you have two choices:
»
» Plug the transformer into a wall socket and then plug the cable’s USB plug into 
the USB receptacle in the transformer.
»
» Plug the USB on the cable into a USB port on your PC.
Then you plug the small end of the cable into the phone. The port is on the ­bottom 
of the phone. You will see that the top is a little smaller than the bottom. It’s a 
trapezoid with rounded edges. Orient the plug with the hole in the phone and 
make sure that you push the little metal plug all the way in.
It doesn’t really matter in what order you plug in things. However, if you use the 
USB port on a PC, the PC needs to be powered on for the phone to charge.
Unplug the transformer when you aren’t charging your phone. A charger left 
plugged in will draw a small but continuous stream of power.
If your phone is off when you’re charging the battery, an image of a battery 
appears onscreen for a moment. The green portion of the battery indicates the 
amount of charge within the battery. You can get the image to reappear with a 
quick press of the Power button. This image tells you the status of the battery 
without your having to turn on the phone.
If your phone is on, you see a small battery icon at the top of the screen showing 
how much charge is in the phone’s battery. When the battery in the phone is fully 
charged, it vibrates to let you know that it’s done charging and that you should 
unplug the phone and charger.
It takes only a few hours to go from a dead battery to a fully charged battery. Other 
than the first time you charge the phone, you don’t need to wait for the battery to 
be fully charged. You can partially recharge and run if you want.
In addition to the transformer and USB cable that come with the phone, you have 
other optional charging tools:
»
» USB travel charger: If you already have a USB travel charger, you can leave 
the transformer at home. This accessory will run you about $15. You still need 
your cable, although any USB-to-micro-USB cable should work.
»
» Car charger: You can buy a charger with a USB port that plugs into the power 
socket/cigarette lighter in a car. This is convenient if you spend a lot of time in 
your car. The list price is $30, but you can get the real Samsung car charger for 
less at some online stores.

24     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
»
» Portable external charger: You can buy a portable external charger with a 
micro-USB port that you can use to recharge your phone without having to 
plug into the power socket or cigarette lighter in a car. You charge this gizmo 
before your travel and connect it only when the charge in your phone starts 
to get low. These usually involve re-chargeable batteries, but some of these 
products use photovoltaic cells to transform light into power. As long as there 
is a USB port (the female part of the USB), all you need is your cable. These 
chargers can cost from $30 to $100 on up. See some options in Figure 2-3.
»
» Wireless charger: This option is slick. You simply put your phone on a charg-
ing mat or in a cradle, and the phone battery will start charging! Your Galaxy 
S7 uses the widely adopted Qi standard (pronounced chee). This option saves 
you from having to plug and unplug your phone.
Ideally, use Samsung chargers or chargers from reputable manufacturers or 
retailers. The power specifications for USB ports are standardized. Reputable 
manufactures comply with these standards, but less reputable manufacturers 
might not. Cheap USB chargers physically fit the USB end of the cable that goes to 
your phone. However, Li-ion batteries are sensitive to voltage. There are many, 
many creative options available outside the store where you bought your phone, 
but avoid the allure of low price.
Li-ion batteries do not like extreme heat. A warm room is one thing, but if you 
leave your phone on the dashboard all day in Phoenix during the summer, your 
battery will die an untimely and permanent death. When your battery dies, your 
phone dies because the Galaxy S7 does not have a user-replaceable battery. If your 
phone is with you, and you can stand the heat, your battery will be fine.

ing options.

CHAPTER 2  Beginning at the Beginning     25
INCREASING YOUR CHARGING KNOWLEDGE
There are so many charging options out there these days, it can be confusing. My simple 
advice is to use a micro-USB cable from a reliable supplier. This is completely valid. 
However, some well-meaning “friends” may try to lead you astray and try something 
else. Do not allow yourself to be fooled.
The following figure shows some of the options that are out in the market right now. 
The micro-USB is on the left. The ones to the right will not work with your phone. Buying 
these would be a waste of money. Trying any of these won’t fit in the receptacle on your 
phone.
The first option is the micro-USB 3.0. The front view of the micro-USB 3.0 connector 
looks like the micro-USB connector front view with a rectangle welded on to the right. 
Frankly, it kinda looks silly, which is why it never really caught on. Samsung used it on the 
Galaxy S5, which is why you might see it in some stores.
The next connector type is the micro-USB C type. This connector type is just coming on 
the market and shows a lot of promise. For a number of reasons, Samsung chose not to 
use it on the S7. This connector can charge a device very quickly. It does this because this 
connector communicates with the device to ensure that the battery doesn’t get too hot. 
If the battery gets hot, the connector knows to slow down the amount of power and give 
the battery a chance to cool.
The third option is the Apple Lighting cable. This is unlike the others because the connec-
tors are visible rather than being protected by a metal shroud. The best thing about it is 
that it costs more, as you can see in the figure that shows car charges from Ventev (one 
of those reputable suppliers I have told you about).
(continued)

26     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
Be aware that the conditions that make for a good charge with a photocell also 
tend to make for high heat. It will do you little good to have a beautifully function-
ing charger and a dead phone.
Navigating the Galaxy S7
Galaxy S7 phone devices differ from many other mobile phones in design: They 
have significantly fewer hardware buttons (physical buttons on the phone). They 
rely much more heavily on software buttons that appear onscreen.
In this section, I guide you through your phone’s buttons.
The phone’s hardware buttons
Samsung has reduced the number of hardware buttons on the Galaxy S7. There are 
only four: the Power button, the Volume button, the Camera button, and the Home 
button. Before you get too far into using your phone, orient yourself to be sure 
that you’re looking at the correct side of the phone. When I refer to the left or right 
of the phone, I’m assuming a vertical orientation (meaning you’re not holding the 
phone sideways) and that you’re looking at the phone’s screen.
Images courtesy of Ventev
The same product has a $5 premium for the Apple connector. (Okay. The Apple cable 
has the smarts I mention for the Type C connector and prevents the Apple iPhone from 
overheating.)
(continued)

CHAPTER 2  Beginning at the Beginning     27
The Power button
The Power button (refer to Figure 2-1) is on right side of the phone, toward the top 
when you hold it in vertical orientation.
In addition to powering up the phone, pressing the Power button puts the device 
into sleep mode if you press it for a moment while the phone is On. Sleep mode 
shuts off the screen and suspends most running applications.
The phone automatically goes into sleep mode after about 30 seconds of inactivity 
to save power, but you might want to do this manually when you put away your 
phone. The Super AMOLED (Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode) screen 
on your Samsung Galaxy S7 is cool, but it also uses a lot of power.
Don’t confuse sleep mode with powering off. Because the screen is the biggest 
user of power on your phone, having the screen go blank saves battery life. The 
phone is still alert to any incoming calls; when someone calls, the screen auto-
matically lights up.
The Volume button(s)
Technically, there are two Volume buttons: one to increase the volume, and the 
other to lower it. Their locations are shown in Figure 2-4.
The Volume buttons control the volume of all the audio sources on the phone, 
including
»
» The phone ringer for when a call comes in (ringtone)
»
» The notifications that occur only when you’re not talking on the phone, such 
as the optional ping that lets you know you’ve received a text or email
»
» The phone headset when you’re talking on the phone
»
» The volume from the digital music and video player (media)
The volume controls are aware of the context; they can tell which volume you’re 
changing. For example, if you’re listening to music, adjusting volume raises or 
lowers the music volume, but leaves the ringer and phone-earpiece volumes 
unchanged.
The Volume buttons are complementary to software settings you can make within 
the applications. For example, you can open the music-player software and turn 
up the volume on the appropriate screen. Then you can use the hardware buttons 
to turn down the volume, and you’ll see the volume setting on the screen go down.

28     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
Another option is to go to a settings screen and set the volume levels for each 
scenario. Here’s how to do that:
1.	 From the Home screen, press either Volume button.
You can press it either up or down. Doing so brings up the screen shown in 
Figure 2-5.
If you press the volume up or down, the ring tone gets louder or softer. Hold 
off on this tweak for now and go to the next step.
FIGURE 2-4: 
The Galaxy S7 
Volume 
buttons on  
the left.

CHAPTER 2  Beginning at the Beginning     29
2.	 From this screen, tap the arrow down in the upper-right corner.
Tapping it brings up the screen shown in Figure 2-6.
3.	 From the screen shown in Figure 2-6, set the volume at the desired setting.
You can adjust the volume of any setting by placing your finger on the dot on 
the slider image. The dot will get bigger; you can slide it to the left to lower this 
particular volume setting or to the right to raise it.
The Home button
The biggest button on the phone is the Home button (see Figure 2-7). It’s on the 
bottom of the front screen.
The Home button brings you back to the Home screen from wherever you are in 
an application. If you’re working on applications and feel like you’re helplessly 
lost, don’t worry. Press the Home button, close your eyes, tap your heels together 
three times, and think to yourself, “There’s no place like home,” and you will be 
brought back to the Home screen.
You don’t really need to do all that other stuff after pressing the Home button. Just 
pressing the Home button does the trick.

The touchscreen
To cram all the information that you need onto one screen, Samsung takes the 
modern approach to screen layout. You’ll want to become familiar with several 
finger-navigation motions used to work with your screen.
FIGURE 2-7: 
The Galaxy S7 
Home button 
on the front.

CHAPTER 2  Beginning at the Beginning     31
Before diving in, though, here’s a small list of terms you need to know:
»
» Icon: An icon is a little image. Tapping an icon launches an application or per-
forms some function, such as making a telephone call.
»
» Button: A button on a touchscreen is meant to look like a three-dimensional 
button that you would push on, say, a telephone. Buttons are typically labeled 
to tell you what they do when you tap them. For example, you’ll see buttons 
labeled Save or Send.
»
» Hyperlink: Sometimes called a link for short, a hyperlink is text that performs 
some function when you tap it. Usually text is lifeless. If you tap a word and it 
does nothing, then it’s just text. If you tap a word and it launches a website or 
causes a screen to pop up, it’s a hyperlink.
»
» Thumbnail: A thumbnail is a small, low-resolution version of a larger, high-
resolution picture stored somewhere else.
With this background, it’s time to discuss the motions you’ll be using on the 
touchscreen.
You need to clean the touchscreen glass from time to time. The glass on your 
phone is Gorilla Glass (made by Corning) — the toughest stuff available to protect 
against breakage. Use a soft cloth or microfiber to get fingerprints off. You can 
even wipe the touchscreen on your clothes. However, never use a paper towel! 
Over time, glass is no match for the fibers in the humble paper towel.
Tap
Often, you just tap the screen to make things happen (as when you launch an app) 
or select options. Think of a tap as a single mouse click on a computer screen. A 
tap is simply a touch on the screen, much like using a touchscreen at a retail kiosk. 
Figure 2-8 shows what the tap motion should look like.
One difference between a mouse click on a computer and a tap on a Galaxy S7 
phone is that a single tap launches applications on the phone in the same way that 
a double-click of the mouse launches an application on a computer.
A tap is different from press and hold (see the next section). If you leave your 
finger on the screen for more than an instant, the phone thinks you want to do 
something other than launch an application.

32     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
Press and hold
Press and hold, as the name implies, involves putting your finger on an icon on the 
screen and leaving it there for more than a second. What happens when you leave 
your finger on an icon depends upon the situation.
For example, when you press and hold on an application on the Home screen (the 
screen that comes up after you turn on the phone), a garbage-can icon appears 
onscreen. This is to remove that icon from that screen. And when you press and 
hold an application icon from the list of applications, the phone assumes that you 
want to copy that application to your Home screen. Don’t worry if these distinc-
tions might not make sense yet. The point is that you should be familiar with 
holding and pressing — and that it’s different from tapping.
You don’t need to tap or press and hold very hard for the phone to know that you 
want it to do something. Neither do you need to worry about breaking the glass, 
even by pressing on it very hard. If you hold the phone in one hand and tap with 
the other, you’ll be fine. I suppose you might break the glass on the phone if you 
put it on the floor and press up into a one-fingered handstand. I don’t recommend 
that, but if you do try it, please post the video on YouTube.
On average, a person calls 911 about once every year. Usually, you call 911 because 
of a stressful situation. Like every phone, the Samsung Galaxy S7 has a special 
stress sensor that causes it to lock up when you need it most. Okay, not really, 
but it seems that way. When you’re stressed, it’s easy to think that you’re tap-
ping when you’re actually pressing and holding. Be aware of this tendency and 
remember to tap.
FIGURE 2-8: 
The tap 
motion.

CHAPTER 2  Beginning at the Beginning     33
Moving around the screen or to the next screen
Additional finger motions help you move around the screens and to adjust the 
scaling for images that you want on the screen. Mastering these motions is impor-
tant to getting the most from your phone.
The first step is navigating the screen to access what’s not visible onscreen. Think 
of this as navigating a regular computer screen, where you use a horizontal scroll 
bar to access information to the right or left of what’s visible on your monitor, or 
a vertical scroll bar to move you up and down on a screen.
The same concept works on your phone. To overcome the practical realities of 
screen size on a phone that will fit into your pocket, the Galaxy S7 phone uses a 
panorama screen layout, meaning that you keep scrolling left or right (or maybe 
up and down) to access different screens.
In a nutshell, although the full width of a screen is accessible, only the part 
bounded by the physical screen of the Galaxy S7 phone is visible on the display. 
Depending upon the circumstances, you have several ways to get to informa-
tion not visible on the active screen. These actions include drag, flicks, pinch and 
stretch, and double taps. I cover all these gestures in the following sections.
Drag
The simplest finger motion on the phone is the drag. You place your finger on a 
point on the screen and then drag the image with your finger. Then you lift your 
finger. Figure 2-9 shows what the motion looks like.
Dragging allows you to move slowly around the panorama. This motion is like 
clicking a scroll bar and moving it slowly.
Flick
To move quickly around the panorama, you can flick the screen to move in the 
direction of your flick (see Figure 2-10).
FIGURE 2-9: 
The drag 
motion for 
controlled 
movement.

34     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
Better control of this motion comes with practice. In general, the faster the flick, 
the more the panorama moves. However, some screens (such as the extended Home 
screen) move only one screen to the right or left, no matter how fast you flick.
Pinch and stretch
Some screens allow you to change the scale of images you view on your screen. 
When this feature is active, the Zoom options change the magnification of the area 
on the screen. You can zoom out to see more features at a smaller size or zoom in 
to see more detail at a larger size.
To zoom out, you put two fingers (apart) on the screen and pull them together to 
pinch the image. Make sure you’re centered on the spot that you want to see in 
more detail. The pinch motion is shows in Figure 2-11.
The opposite motion is to zoom in. This involves the stretch motion, as shown in 
Figure 2-12. You place two fingers (close together) and stretch them apart.

CHAPTER 2  Beginning at the Beginning     35
Double tap
The double tap (shown in Figure 2-13) just means tapping the same button area 
on the screen twice in rapid succession. You use the double tap to jump between 
a zoomed-in and a zoomed-out image to get you back to the previous resolution. 
This option saves you frustration in getting back to a familiar perspective.
When you double tap, time the taps so that the phone doesn’t interpret them as 
two separate taps. With a little practice, you’ll master the timing of the second tap.
The extended Home screen
The Home screen is the first screen you see when the phone is done with set-
ting up. Additional screens off to the right and left. make up the extended Home 
screen. They can be seen as a panorama in Figure 2-14.
At any given moment, you see only one screen at a time. You navigate among the 
screen by flicking to the right and left. Pressing the Home button will always bring 
you back to one of these screens. Right now, the left-most screen is designated as 
the Home screen.
The extended Home screen is where you can organize icons and other functions 
to best make the phone convenient for you. Out of the box, Samsung and your 
cellular carrier have worked together to create a starting point for you. Beyond 
that, though, you have lots of ways you can customize your Home screen for easy 
access to the things that are most important to you. Much of the book covers all 
the things that the phone can do, but a recurring theme is how to put your favorite 
capabilities on your Home screen, if you wish.

36     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
To start, check out the layout of the Home screen and how it relates to other areas 
of the phone. Knowing these areas is important for basic navigation.
Figure 2-15 shows a typical Home screen and highlights three important areas on 
the phone:
»
» The notification area: This part of the screen presents you with small icons 
that let you know if something important is up, like battery life.
»
» The primary shortcuts: These five icons remain stationary as you move 
across the Home screen. If you notice in Figure 2-15, these have been deter-
mined by Samsung and your cellular carrier to be the five most important 
applications on your phone and are on all the screens.
»
» The Function keys: These three keys control essential phone functions, 
regardless of what else is going on at the moment with the phone.
There are a series of dots just above the primary shortcuts on the extended Home 
screen. You may also notice that one of the dots isn’t just a dot — it’s a little 
house. That is the “home” Home screen. The brightest dot indicates where you 
are among the screens. You can navigate among screens by dragging the screen to 
the left or right. This moves you one screen at a time. You can also jump multiple 
screens by tapping on the dot that corresponds to the screen number you want to 
see or by dragging the dots to the screen you want to see. The following sections 
give you more detail on each area.

CHAPTER 2  Beginning at the Beginning     37
Adding shortcuts to the Home screen
You have a lot of screen real estate where you can put icons of your favorite appli-
cations and widgets (refer to Figure 2-14). (Widgets are small apps that take care 
of simple functions, like displaying time or the status of your battery.) You can 
FIGURE 2-15: 
Important 
areas on the 
Galaxy S7 
phone and 
Home screen.

38     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
add shortcuts to the apps and to these widgets to your Home screen by following 
these steps:
1.	 From the extended Home screen page where there is some space for the 
icon of an app, tap the Apps icon on the primary shortcuts.
This brings up a directory of all the apps you currently have on the phone. The 
page shown in Figure 2-16 shows just one page. The number of apps and 
pages for their icons is practically unlimited. (I cover how to add new apps in 
Chapter 8.)
2.	 Press and hold the icon of the app you want to add.
The screen with the app icons fades, and the page with the space for the icon 
appears with the icon under your finger.
3.	 Move the icon to where you want it to be on the Home screen page and 
release.
Done.
FIGURE 2-16: 
An Apps page.

CHAPTER 2  Beginning at the Beginning     39
Taking away or moving shortcuts
Say that you put the shortcut on the wrong spot. No problem. Press and hold the 
icon. The screen grays out except for your icon. It looks something like Figure 2-17, 
except the icon you pressed is in full color under your finger.
You then drag the icon to the place on the screen you want it to reside and release. 
Taking a shortcut off your Home screen is simple: Press and hold the icon on the 
screen. In a moment, you see the grayed out home page. Drag the doomed short-
cut to the garbage can, and off it goes to its maker.
It’s gone, but if you made a mistake, you can get it back easily enough. To re-
create it, simply go back to the App Menu key and follow the process again.

Home

40     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
The notification area and screen
The notification area is located at the top of the phone (refer to Figure 2-15). Here, 
you see little status icons. Maybe you received a text or an email, or you’ll see an 
application needs some tending to.
Think of the notification area as a special email inbox where your carrier (or even 
the phone itself) can give you important information about what’s happening 
with your phone. These little icons at the top tell you the condition of the different 
radio systems on your phone: The number of bars shown gives you an indication 
of signal strength, and usually the phone will also tell you what kind of mobile 
data speed you’re getting – such as 3G or 4G.
You could take the time to learn the meanings of all the little icons that might 
come up, but that would take you a while. A more convenient option is to touch 
the notification area and pull it down, as shown in Figure 2-18.
The rest of the screen is written so that you can understand what’s going on and 
what, if anything, you’re expected to do — for example, if you see that you have 
connected to the Wi-Fi access point you intended.
When you’re finished reading the notifications, you slide your finger back up to 
the top. If this screen gets too full, you can clear it by tapping the Clear button. 
You can also clear notifications one at a time by touching each one and swiping it 
to the side.
If you want a shortcut to control some key phone capabilities, you can tap one of 
the five, dark-blue circles. For example, if you want to turn off Wi-Fi, you could 
just tap the Wi-Fi icon. This would save you from having to get in to Settings to 
do the same thing.
FIGURE 2-18: 
Notification 
area pull down.

CHAPTER 2  Beginning at the Beginning     41
If you want to add more of these, simply tap the arrow down to see your Quick 
Settings options. These are seen in Figure 2-19, although you may have slightly 
different choices on your phone.
For example, many people find the Flashlight capability to be handy. If it is not 
already there when you pull down the notifications screen, see whether it is 
among the options. If it is, press and hold on the flashlight icon. Then drag it to 
the top. The other icons scatter, and then you release it. You turn on the flashlight 
by tapping it. Try it and see.
The Device Function keys
At the bottom of the screen, below the rectangular screen display, are three impor-
tant buttons: the Device Function keys. They’re always present for you to navigate 
your phone even though the backlight might switch off to hide their presence. 
Whatever else you’re doing on the phone, these buttons can take over. I talk about 
the Home button earlier in this chapter. The other buttons are equally cool.
FIGURE 2-19: 
Notification 
area options.

42     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
Recent Apps button
The button to the left of the Home button is the Recent Apps button. Tapping the 
button brings up a list of the open apps. This is handy to navigate between run-
ning apps. Figure 2-20 shows a typical screen of recent apps.
You can scroll among the open apps by flicking up or down. You can jump to one 
of these apps by tapping somewhere on the image. You can also shut down one of 
the apps by tapping the x on the upper-right corner. You can shut them all down 
by tapping the link at the bottom that says Close All.
The Device Function keys are cool because they light up when you’re touching 
them or the screen, but fade away the rest of the time.
The Back button
The Back button on your phone is similar to the Back button in a web browser: It 
takes you back one screen.
FIGURE 2-20: 
Recent Apps 
screen.

CHAPTER 2  Beginning at the Beginning     43
As you start navigating through the screens on your phone, tapping the Back but-
ton takes you back to the previous screen. If you keep tapping the Back button, 
you’ll eventually return to the Home screen.
The keyboard
The screen of the Galaxy S7 phone is important, but you’ll still probably spend 
more time on the keyboard entering data on the QWERTY keyboard.
Using the software keyboard
The software keyboard automatically pops up when the application detects a need 
for user text input. The keyboard, shown in Figure 2-21, appears at the bottom of 
the screen.
Using Swype
Some Galaxy S7 phones come with an enhanced data-entering capability called 
Swype. This option may have been preloaded on your phone. If not, you can down-
load it from the Google Play Store. With a little practice, it can dramatically speed 
your ability to type fast on your phone.
Here’s how Swype works: Instead of tapping each discrete key on the keyboard, 
you leave your finger on the screen and swipe from key to key. The Swype applica-
tion figures out the words you’re wanting to type, including inserting the spaces 
automatically.
If you like Swype, you can use it anytime you’re entering data. If you don’t care for 
it, you can just tap your letters. It’s all up to you!
FIGURE 2-21: 
Use the soft-
ware keyboard 
to enter data.

44     PART 1  Getting Started with the Samsung Galaxy S7
Using voice recognition
The third option for a keyboard is . . . no keyboard at all! Galaxy S7 phones come 
with voice recognition as an option. It’s very easy and works surprisingly well. In 
most spots where you have an option to enter text, you see a small version of the 
microphone icon shown in Figure 2-22.
Just tap this icon and say what you would have typed. You see the phone thinking 
for a second, and then a screen tells you that it is listening. Go ahead and start 
talking. When you’re done, you can tap the Done button or just be quiet and wait. 
Within a few seconds, you’ll read what you just said!
The orientation of the phone
Earlier in this chapter where I discuss the Power button, I refer to the phone being 
in vertical orientation (so that the phone is tall and narrow). It can also be used in 
the landscape orientation (sideways, or so that the phone is short and wide). The 
phone senses in which direction you’re holding it and orients the screen to make 
it easier for you to view.
The phone makes its orientation known to the application, but not all applica-
tions are designed to change their inherent display. That nuance is left to the 
writers of the application. For example, your phone can play videos. However, the 
video player application that comes with your phone shows video in landscape 
mode only.
FIGURE 2-22: 
The voice 
­recognition 
icon.

CHAPTER 2  Beginning at the Beginning     45
In addition, the phone can sense when you’re holding it to your ear. When it 
senses that it’s held in this position, it shuts off the screen. You need not be con-
cerned that you’ll accidentally “chin-dial” a number in Botswana.
Going to Sleep Mode/Turning  
Off the Phone
You can leave your phone on every minute until you’re ready to upgrade to the 
newest Galaxy S7 phone in a few years, but that would use up your battery in no 
time. Instead, put your idle phone in sleep mode to save battery power. Note: Your 
phone goes into sleep mode automatically after 30 seconds of inactivity on the 
screen.
You can adjust the sleep time out for a longer duration, which I cover in Chap-
ter 16. Or you can manually put the phone in sleep mode by pressing the Power 
button for just a moment.
Sometimes it’s best to simply shut down the phone if you aren’t going to use it for 
several days or more. To shut down the phone completely, simply press and hold 
the Power button for a few seconds. The following options appear:
»
» Power Off: Shut down the phone completely.
»
» Restart: The Android operating system is stable. Well, mostly stable. 
Sometimes you may want to reboot it because it starts acting quirky. Tap the 
restart option and see whether that solves the problem.
»
» Emergency Mode: This is an interesting option. Once you have agreed to 
some terms and conditions, your phone will go into hibernation, but it can 
come back to life quickly if you feel you need to dial 911. Before you can use 
this option, you need to agree to some of the limitations.
Good night!

Calling People
A
t its essence, any cellphone — no matter how fancy or smart — exists to 
make phone calls. The good news is that making and receiving phone calls 
on your Galaxy S7 is easy.
In this chapter, I show you not only how to make a call, but also how to use your 
call list to keep track of your calls. And don’t skip the section on using your phone 
for emergencies.
Finally, if you’re like many people, you’re never doing just one thing at a time, 
and a Bluetooth headset can make it easier for you to talk on the phone while driv-
ing and getting directions, checking email, wrangling kids and dogs, or just plain 
living life. In this chapter, I show you how to hook up your phone to a Bluetooth 
headset so that you can make and receive phone calls hands-free.
Making Calls
After your phone is on and you’re connected to your cellular carrier (see Chap-
ters 1 and 2), you can make a phone call. It all starts from the Home screen. Along 
the bottom of the screen, above the Device Function keys, are five icons, which are 
Chapter 3

50     PART 2  Communications
the primary shortcuts (see Figure 3-1). The primary shortcuts on your phone may 
differ slightly, but in this case, from left to right, they are
»
» Phone
»
» Chrome (Internet browser)
»
» Messages
»
» Apps
To make a call, follow these steps:
1.	 From the Home screen, tap the Phone icon. 
You will see a screen like the one shown in Figure 3-2. This screen shows any 
calls you have made or received, such as the one from your carrier to confirm 
that you phone has been set up correctly.
2.	 Tap the Dial Pad icon.
This icon is a green circle with little white dots that symbolize the touch pad on 
a regular landline phone.
3.	 Tap the telephone number you want to call.
The Keypad screen (see Figure 3-3) appears. This looks like a full-sized version 
of a touch pad on a regular landline phone. (If you have not made or received 
any calls at all, tapping the Phone icon takes you right to the Keypad screen.)
Don’t be alarmed if you don’t hear a dial tone. Smartphones don’t connect to a 
network until after you dial your number and tap Send. At this point, a dial 
tone would be pointless.
For long distance calls while in the United States, you don’t need to dial 1 before 
the area code — just dial the area code and then the seven-digit phone 
number. Similarly, you can include the 1 and the area code for local calls. On 
the other hand, if you’re traveling internationally, you need to include the 
1 — and be prepared for international roaming charges!
FIGURE 3-1: 
The primary 
shortcuts on 
the Home 
screen.

CHAPTER 3  Calling People     51
In Chapter 6, you can read about how to make a phone call through your 
contacts.
4.	 Tap the green phone button at the bottom of the screen to place the call.
The screen changes to the screen seen in Figure 3-4. You have a chance to 
verify you dialed the person you intended.
Within a few seconds, you should hear the phone ringing at the other end or a 
busy signal. From then on, it is like a regular phone call.
5.	 When you’re done with your call, tap the red phone button at the bottom of 
the screen.
The call is disconnected.

screen for the

52     PART 2  Communications
If the other party answers the phone, you have a few options available to you by 
tapping on the correct icon/hyperlink on the screen, including
»
» Put the call on hold
»
» Add another call to have a three-way conversation
»
» Increase the volume
»
» Switch on a Bluetooth device (see the section “Syncing a Bluetooth Headset,” 
later in this chapter)
»
» Turn on the phone’s speaker
»
» Bring up the keypad to enter numbers
»
» Mute the microphone on the phone
You can do any or all of these, or you can just enjoy talking on the phone.
FIGURE 3-3: 
Dial the 
number from 
the Keypad 
screen.

CHAPTER 3  Calling People     53
If the call doesn’t go through, either the cellular coverage where you are is insuffi-
cient, or your phone got switched to Airplane mode, which shuts off all the radios 
in the phone. (It’s possible, of course, that your cellular carrier let you out the door 
without having set you up for service, but that’s pretty unlikely!)
Check the notification section at the top of the screen. If there are no connection-
strength bars, try moving to another location. If you see a small airplane silhou-
ette, bring down the notification screen (see how in Chapter 2) and tap the plane 
icon to turn off Airplane mode.
If you pull down the notification screen and you don’t see the green silhouette of 
an airplane, scroll the green or gray icons to the left. This icon may be off the page. 
Alternatively, tap the icon with the boxes in the upper-right corner, and you will 
see all the notification icons.
FIGURE 3-4: 
Dialing screen.

54     PART 2  Communications
Answering Calls
Receiving a call is even easier than making a call. When someone calls you, caller 
ID information appears in a pop-up screen. Figure 3-5 shows some screen options 
for an incoming call.
To answer the call, tap or slide the green phone button. To not answer a call, you 
can simply ignore the ringing, or you can tap or slide the red phone button. The 
ringing stops immediately, and in either case, the call goes to voicemail.
In Part 4, I fill you in on some exciting options that you can enable (or not) when 
you get a call. For example, you can specify a unique ringtone for a particular 
number, or have an image of the caller pop up (if you save your contacts to your 
phone).
Regardless of what you were doing on the phone at that moment — such as lis-
tening to music or playing a game — the answer pop-up screen can appear. Any 
active application, including music or video, is suspended until the call is over.
FIGURE 3-5: 
Possible 
screens when 
you’re 
­receiving a call.

CHAPTER 3  Calling People     55
For callers to leave you messages, you must set up your voicemail. If you haven’t 
yet set up your voicemail, the caller will hear a recorded message saying that your 
voicemail account isn’t yet set up. Some cellular carriers can set up voicemail for 
you when you activate the account and get the phone; others require you to set up 
voicemail on your own. Ask how voicemail works at your carrier store or look for 
instructions in the manual included with your phone.
The answer and reject icons are pretty standard on any cellular phone. However, 
your Galaxy S7 is no standard phone. There is a third option, and what happens 
depends on your individual phone. In addition to the standard options of answer 
or reject, you have one more option — to reject and send the caller a text message. 
As your caller is sent to your voicemail, you also can immediately send the caller 
a text message that acknowledges the call.
Some of the typical canned messages that you can send are
»
» Sorry, I’m busy. Call back later.
»
» I’m in a meeting.
»
» I’m driving.
»
» I’m at the movie theater.
»
» I’m in class.
You tap the message that applies. The message is sent as a text right away, which 
alerts the caller that you’re not ignoring him — it’s just that you can’t talk right 
now. Nice touch.
You can also create and store your own message, like “Go away and leave me 
alone,” or “Whatever I am doing is more important than talking to you.” You 
could also be polite. To create your own canned message, tap Compose new mes-
sage and type away. It’s then stored on your phone for when you need it.
The caller has to be able to receive text messages on the phone used to make the 
call. This feature doesn’t work if your caller is calling from a landline or a cell-
phone that can’t receive texts.
Keeping Track of Your Calls: The Call List
One of the nice features of cellular phones is that the phone keeps a record of 
the calls that you’ve made and received. Sure, you might have caller ID on your 
landline at home or work, but most landline phones don’t keep track of whom 

56     PART 2  Communications
you called. Cellphones, on the other hand, keep track of all the numbers you called. 
This information can be quite convenient, like when you want to return a call and 
you don’t have that number handy. In addition, you can easily add a number to 
the contact list on your phone.
By tapping the Recent link on the phone screen, you get a list of all incoming and 
outgoing calls. (This hyperlink is located toward the top of the screen shown on 
the left side in Figure 3-2.) When you tap the Recent hyperlink, you see a call log 
like the one shown in Figure 3-6.
The tabs along the top include
»
» Outgoing call you made: An orange arrow points to the number.
»
» Incoming call you received: A green arrow points away from the number.
»
» Incoming call you missed: A red phone silhouette with a broken arrow.
»
» Incoming call you ignored: A blue slash sign is next to the phone number.
FIGURE 3-6: 
A call log.

CHAPTER 3  Calling People     57
The log is a list of all the calls you made or were made to you. This is handy so that 
you can easily call someone again or call her back. By tapping any number in your 
call list, you see a screen like the one shown in Figure 3-7. From this screen, you 
can do several things:
»
» See the date and time the call was logged and all previous calls to and from 
this number.
»
» Call the number by tapping the green call button.
»
» Send a text to that number by tapping the orange envelope icon. (More on 
this in Chapter 4.)
»
» Mark that number as a favorite by tapping the More hyperlink. Your favorites 
appears on the Keypad screen (refer to Figure 3-3), which saves you from hav-
ing to dial the number.
»
» Add the number to your contacts list by tapping the Create Contact button 
if the number does not have a contact set up or Update Existing if this is 
someone who has a contact entry, but for whom this is a new number. I cover 
contacts in more detail in Chapter 6.
FIGURE 3-7: 
Call Log detail.

58     PART 2  Communications
Making an Emergency Call: The 411 on 911
Cellphones are wonderful tools for calling for help in an emergency. The Samsung 
Galaxy S7, like all phones in the United States and Canada, can make emergency 
calls to 911.
Just tap the Phone icon on the Home screen, tap 911, and then tap Send. You’ll be 
routed to the 911 call center nearest to your location. This works wherever you’re 
at within the United States. So, say you live in Chicago but have a car accident 
in Charlotte; just tap 911 to be connected to the 911 call center in Charlotte, not 
Chicago.
Even if your phone isn’t registered on a network, you don’t have a problem as long 
as you have a charge in the battery. You phone lets you know that the only number 
you can dial is a 911 call center, even if the Home screen is locked.
When you call 911 from a landline, the address you’re calling from is usually dis-
played for the operator. When you’re calling from a cellphone, though, the opera-
tor doesn’t have that specific information. So, when you call 911, the operator 
might say, “911. Where is your emergency?” Don’t let this question throw you; 
after all, you’re probably focused on what is happening and not on where. Take 
a moment and come up with a good description of where you are — the street 
you’re on, the nearest cross street (if you know it), any businesses or other land-
marks nearby. An operator who knows where you are is in a better position to help 
you with your emergency. Your phone does have a GPS receiver in it that 911 cen-
ters can access. However, it’s not always accurate; it may not be receiving location 
information at that moment, as is the case when you’re indoors.
WHEN YOU ACCIDENTALLY DIAL 911
If you accidentally dial 911 from your phone, don’t hang up. Just tell the operator that it 
was an accidental call. She might ask some questions to verify that you are indeed safe 
and not being forced to say that your call was an accident.
If you panic and hang up after accidentally dialing 911, you’ll get a call from the nearest 
911 call center. Always answer the call, even if you feel foolish. If you don’t answer the 
call, the 911 call centers will assume that you’re in trouble and can’t respond. They’ll track 
you down from the GPS in your phone to verify that you’re safe. If you thought you’d 
feel foolish explaining your mistake to a 911 operator, imagine how foolish you’d feel 
explaining it to the police officer who tracks you down and is upset with you for wasting 
the department’s time.

CHAPTER 3  Calling People     59
When traveling outside the United States or Canada, 911 might not be the number 
you call in an emergency. Mexico uses 066, 060, or 080, but most tourist areas 
also accept 911. And most — but not all — of Europe uses 112. Knowing the local 
emergency number is as important as knowing enough of the language to say you 
need help.
Syncing a Bluetooth Headset
With a Bluetooth headset device, you can talk on your phone without having to 
hold the phone to your ear — and without any cords running from the phone to 
your earpiece. You’ve probably come across plenty of people talking on Bluetooth 
headsets. You might even have wondered whether they were a little crazy talk-
ing to themselves. Well, call yourself crazy now, because when you start using a 
Bluetooth headset, you might never want to go back.
Not surprisingly, Galaxy S7 phones can connect to Bluetooth devices. The first 
step to using a Bluetooth headset with your phone is to sync the two devices. 
Here’s how:
1.	 From the Home screen on your phone, tap the Apps icon.
This gets you to the list of all the applications on your phone.
2.	 Flick or pan to the Settings icon and tap it.
The Settings icon is shown here. This screen holds most of the settings that you 
can adjust on your phone. If you prefer, you can also bring down the notifica-
tion screen and tap the gear icon or tap the menu button on the Home screen. 
All these actions will get you to the same place.
Tapping on the Settings icon brings up the screen shown in Figure 3-8.
3.	 Tap the Bluetooth icon.
This will bring up one of the two screens shown in Figure 3-9. If Bluetooth is off, 
it will looks like the screen to the left. If it is on, it will look like the screen on the 
right.
4.	 Put the phone in to Pairing mode by turning on Bluetooth or by turning 
Bluetooth off and on again.
This step enables your phone to be visible to other Bluetooth devices. This 
state will last for about 60 seconds — enough time for you to get your 
Bluetooth device into pairing mode so that both devices can negotiate the 
proper security settings and pair up every time they “see” each other from now 
on. For example, the phone in the right image in Figure 3-9 recognizes its old 

60     PART 2  Communications
friend, the Bose Color SoundLink. This device and the phone are seen in this 
image trying to re-establish a connection. The SoundLink and this phone had a 
connection at one time. That connection was broken. Now they want to pair up 
again. This is automatic once you exchange the correct security code.
5.	 Next, put your headset into sync mode.
Follow the instructions that came with your headset.
After a moment, the phone “sees” the headset. When it does, you’re prompted 
to enter the security code, and the software keyboard pops up.
6.	 Enter the security code for your headset and then tap the Enter button.
The security code on most headsets is 0000, but check the instructions that 
came with your headset if that number doesn’t work.
Your phone might see other devices in the immediate area. If so, it asks you 
which device you want to pair with. Tap the name of your headset.
Your headset is now synced to your phone. If you turn one on when the other 
is already on, they recognize each other and automatically pair up.

CHAPTER 3  Calling People     61
Options Other than Headsets
Headsets are not the only option anymore. Although many people walk around 
with the ubiquitous Bluetooth headset dangling from an ear, many other choices 
are out there. You can sync to all kinds of Bluetooth devices, including external 
keyboards, laptops, tablets, external speakers, and even your car.
There are also external sensors for measuring blood pressure, heart rate, and a lot 
of other physical information. Some of these are built into wearable devices, like 
a fitness bracelet. Manufacturers are now embedding computers into home appli-
ances that can also connect to your smartphone through Bluetooth!
The good news is that regardless of the technology, you can connect all these 
devices to your phone simply by using the steps described in the preceding ­section. 
I talk more about these possibilities in later chapters.

Discovering the 
Joy of Text
S
 
ure, cellphones are made for talking. But these days, many people use their 
cellphones even more for texting.
Even the most basic phones support texting these days, but your Galaxy S7 phone 
makes sending and receiving text messages more convenient, no matter whether 
you’re an occasional or pathological texter. In this chapter, I fill you in on how to 
send a text message (with or without an attachment), how to receive a text mes-
sage, and how to read your old text messages.
This chapter uses images from the Samsung Messaging application. It is possible 
that your phone may have as its default another texting application. If so, you 
can easily switch to the Messaging app. You can also use the default app, but the 
images will be somewhat different. Your choice.
Sending the First Text Message
Text messages (which are short messages, usually 160 characters or less, sent by 
cellphone) are particularly convenient when you can’t talk at the moment (maybe 
Chapter 4

64     PART 2  Communications
you’re in a meeting or class) or when you just have a small bit of information to 
share (“Running late — see you soon!”).
Many cellphone users — particularly younger ones — prefer sending texts to mak-
ing a phone call. They find texting a faster and more convenient way to communi-
cate, and they often use texting shorthand to fit more content in a short message.
There are two scenarios for texting. The first is when you send someone a text 
for the first time. The second is when you have a text conversation with a person.
When you first get your phone and are ready to brag about your new Galaxy S7 and 
want to send a text to your best friend, here’s how easy it is:
1.	 On the Home screen, tap the Messages icon.
The Messages icon looks like an envelope. When you tap it, you will get a 
mostly blank Home screen for texting. This is shown in Figure 4-1.
When you have some conversations going, it begins to fill up.
FIGURE 4-1: 
The initial  
Messaging 
Home screen.

CHAPTER 4  Discovering the Joy of Text     65
2.	 Tap the New Message icon (the pencil hovering over a blank page).
Tapping the New Message icon brings up the screen seen in Figure 4-2.
3.	 Tap to enter the recipient’s ten-digit mobile telephone number.
A text box appears at the top of the screen with the familiar To field at the top. 
The keyboard appears at the bottom of the screen.
As shown in Figure 4-3, the top field is where you type the telephone number. 
The numerals are along the top of the keyboard.
Be sure to include the area code, even if the person you’re texting is local. 
There’s no need to include a 1 before the number.
If this is your first text, you haven’t had a chance to build up a history of texts. 
After you’ve been using your messaging application for a while, you will have 
entered contact information, and your phone will start trying to anticipate your 
intended recipient.
FIGURE 4-2: 
A blank texting 
screen.

66     PART 2  Communications
4.	 To type your text message, tap the text box that says Enter message. 
Figure 4-4 shows you where to enter your text.
Your message will appear in the text box to the right of the paper clip icon.
In the Android Messaging app, your text message can be up to 160 characters, 
including spaces and punctuation. The application counts down the number of 
characters you have left.
5.	 Send the text by tapping the Send button to the right of your message.
The Send button is grayed out before you start typing. After you type some-
thing, it turns full-on orange. Once you tap the button, the phone takes it from 
here. Within a few seconds, the message is sent to your friend’s cellphone.
After you build your contact list (read about this in Chapter 6), you can tap a name 
from the contact list or start typing a name in the recipient text box. If there’s 
only one number for that contact, your phone assumes that’s the receiving phone 
you want to send a text to. If that contact has multiple numbers, it asks you which 
phone number you want to send your text to.
FIGURE 4-3: 
Type the 
recipient’s 
number in the 
upper text box.

CHAPTER 4  Discovering the Joy of Text     67
In most cases, the default for your texting app is for your phone to automatically 
correct what it thinks is a misspelled word. You can see it guess on the darker gray 
area under the text message. This capability is called autocorrect. You may find 
it very handy, or you may find it annoying. If you like it, you should still verify 
that it corrected the word in the right way. If you want evidence as to why this is 
a good idea, search “funny autocorrect examples” in your favorite search engine 
(although some can be very racy).
You’ve probably heard a thousand times about how it’s a very bad idea to text 
while you’re driving. Here comes one-thousand-and-one. It’s a very bad idea to 
text while you’re driving — and illegal in some places. There are Dummies who 
read this book, who are actually very smart, and then there are DUMMIES who 
text and drive. I want you to be the former and not the latter.
FIGURE 4-4:

68     PART 2  Communications
Carrying on a Conversation via Texting
In the bad ol’ pre-Galaxy S days, most cellular phones would keep a log of your 
texts. The phone kept the texts that you sent or received in sequential order, 
regardless of who sent or received them.
Texts stored sequentially are old-school. Your Galaxy S7 keeps track of the contact 
with whom you’ve been texting and stores each set of back-and-forth messages 
as a conversation.
In Figure 4-5, you can see that the first page for messaging holds conversations. 
After you start texting someone, those texts are stored in one conversation.
As Figure 4-5 shows, each text message is presented in sequence, with the author 
of the text indicated by the direction of the text balloon.
FIGURE 4-5: 
A messaging 
conversation.

CHAPTER 4  Discovering the Joy of Text     69
Note the Enter message text box at the bottom of the screen. With this convenient 
feature, you can send whatever you type to the person with whom you’re having 
a conversation.
In the bad old days, it was sometimes hard to keep straight the different texting 
conversations you were having. When you start a texting conversation with some-
one else, there is a second conversation.
Before too long, you’ll have multiple conversations going on. Don’t worry. They 
aren’t the kind of conversations you need to keep going constantly. No one thinks 
twice if you don’t text for a while. The image in Figure 4-6 shows how the text 
page from Figure 4-1 can look before too long.
It is easy to change the font size of conversations. To make the fonts larger and 
easier to read, use the stretch motion. Use the pinch motion to make the fonts 
smaller so that you can see more of the conversation.

Sending an Attachment with a Text
What if you want to send something in addition to or instead of text? Say you want 
to send a picture, some music, or a Word document along with your text. Easy as 
pie, as long as the phone on the receiving end can recognize the attachment. Here 
is the recipe:
1.	 From the Home screen, tap the Messages icon.
2.	 Either tap the New Message icon and enter the number of the intended 
recipient or pick up on an existing conversion.
You’ll see the text creation page from Figure 4-2. Enter the information you 
want like a normal text.
3.	 To add an attachment, tap the icon that looks like a paper clip to the left of 
where you enter text.
The paper-clip icon brings up the screen you see in Figure 4-7, which asks what 
kind of file you want to attach. Your choices include pictures, videos, audio files, 
and some others I describe in Chapters 9, 12, 13, and 14 when you have some 
good files to share. For now, it’s just good that you know you have options.
4.	 Tap your choice of file type, and your phone presents you with the options 
that fall into that category.
Get ready to be amazed. At the bottom of the screen, you have three choices. 
Figure 4-7 shows the Other category. This is for any file you want to attach that 
is already on your phone. It can be your electronic business card. It could be 
a video.
The middle option, Gallery, takes you to all the images you have stored on your 
phone. Samsung knows that the most common attachment is a photo. 
Tapping the Gallery options makes it that much easier.
The last option, going right to left, is the Camera. When you select this option, it 
opens up your camera so that you can take a picture and immediately send it 
to the recipient. How cool is that?!
5.	 Continue typing your text message, if needed.
6.	 When you’re done with the text portion of the message, tap the Send 
­button, and off it all goes.
A simple text message is an SMS (short message service) message. When you add 
an attachment, you’re sending an MMS (multimedia messaging service) message. 
Back in the day, MMS messages cost more to send and receive than SMS messages 
did. These days, that isn’t the case in the United States.

CHAPTER 4  Discovering the Joy of Text     71
Receiving Text Messages
Receiving a text is even easier than sending one.
When you’re having a text conversation and you get a new text from the person 
you’re texting with, your phone beeps and/or vibrates. Also, the notification area 
of the screen (the very top) shows a very small version of the Messages icon.
You can either pull down the notification area from the very top of the screen or 
start the messaging application. Your choice.
If an attachment comes along, it’s included in the conversation screen.
To access the text, you need to unlock the screen. The Messages icon (an envelope) 
also displays the number of new texts that you have. Tap that icon to open the 
conversations.
FIGURE 4-7: 
File types you 
can attach  
to a text.

72     PART 2  Communications
Managing Your Text History
The Messaging Conversations screen stores and organizes all your texts until you 
delete them. You should clean up this screen every now and then.
The simplest option for managing your messages is to tap the Menu icon and then 
tap Delete Threads. You can then select and unselect all the conversations that you 
want deleted. Tap the Delete link at the bottom of the screen, and they disappear.
Another deletion option is to open the conversation. You can delete each text by 
pressing and holding on the balloon. After a moment, a menu appears from which 
you can delete that message. This method is a lot slower if you have lots of texts, 
though.
I recommend that you be vicious in deleting the older texts and conversations. 
Trust me; deleting all your old messages can be cathartic!

f you’ve had email on your phone for a while, you know how convenient it is. 
If your Galaxy S7 phone is your first cellphone with the capability to send and 
receive email, prepare to be hooked.
I start this chapter by showing you how to set up your email, regardless of whether 
your email program is supported. Then I show you how to read and manage your 
email. Finally, I tell you how to write and send email in the last section in this chapter.
Setting Up Your Email
These days, many people have multiple personal email address for many reasons. 
Your phone’s Email app can manage up to ten email accounts. With a Galaxy S7 
phone, you may need to create a separate email account on Google’s Gmail just for 
your phone. If you do not get a Gmail account, you’ll miss out on so many exciting 
capabilities. I highly recommend setting up a new Gmail account if you don’t have 
one already (see the upcoming section “Setting up a new Gmail account).
Chapter 5

74     PART 2  Communications
The Email app on your phone routinely “polls” all the email systems for which 
you identify an email account and password. It then presents you with copies of 
your email.
Your phone mainly interacts with your inbox on your email account. It isn’t really 
set up to work like the full-featured email application on your computer, though. 
For example, many email packages integrate with a sophisticated word processor, 
have sophisticated filing systems for your saved messages, and offer lots of fonts. 
As long as you don’t mind working without these capabilities, you might never 
need to get on your computer to access your email again, and you could store 
email in folders on your phone. In practice, however, phone access to email is best 
used in working with email that is in your inbox.
Setup is easy, and having access to all your email makes you so productive that 
I advise you to consider adding all your email accounts to your phone.
Getting ready
In general, connecting to a personal email account simply involves entering the 
name of your email account(s) and its password(s) in your phone. Have these 
handy when you’re ready to set up your phone.
As mentioned, you can have up to ten email accounts on your phone; however, you 
do need to pick one account as your favorite. You can send an email using any of 
the accounts, but your phone wants to know the email account that you want it to 
use as a default.
Next, you may want to have access to your work account. This is relatively 
­common these days, but some companies see this as a security problem. You 
should consult with your IT department for some extra information. Technologi-
cally, it’s not hard to make this kind of thing happen as long as your business 
email is reasonably modern.
Finally, if you don’t already have a Gmail account, I strongly encourage you to 
get one. Read the nearby sidebar, “The advantages of getting a Gmail account” to 
find out why.

CHAPTER 5  Sending and Receiving Email     75
Setting up your existing Gmail account
If you already have a Gmail account, setting it up on your phone is easy as can be. 
Follow these steps from the Apps menu:
1.	 Find the Gmail icon in the Apps list.
Here is a confusing part. The icon on the left in Figure 5-1 is the Gmail app. The 
icon on the right is for the general email app. The general email app is for your 
combined email accounts. The general email account is the app that you will 
use to access any and all of your email accounts.
THE ADVANTAGES OF GETTING  
A GMAIL ACCOUNT
You might already have work and personal email accounts. You might even have an old 
email account that you check only once in a while because some friends, for whatever 
reason, haven’t updated their profile for you and continue to use an old address.
The thought of getting yet another email address, even one that’s free, might (under-
standably) be unappealing. After all, it’s another address and password to remember. 
However, some important functions on your phone require a Gmail account:
•	 The ability to buy applications from the Google Play Store. (This is huge!) I go over 
the Play Store in Chapter 8.
•	 The ability to use the Google Drive for storage. (This is pretty important and almost 
huge!)
•	 Free access to the photo site Picasa (although other sites have many of the same 
features).
•	 Automatic backup of your contacts and calendar. That’s explained in more detail in 
Chapters 6 and 13.
To make a long story short, it’s worth the trouble to get a Gmail account, even if you 
already have a personal email account.
FIGURE 5-1: 
The Email and 
Gmail icons.

76     PART 2  Communications
2.	 Tap the Gmail icon.
Because your phone does not know if you have a Gmail account yet, it offers 
you the option of entering your Gmail account or whether you want to create a 
new account. This page is shown in Figure 5-2.
3.	 Enter your Gmail account email address and tap Next.
Be sure to include the @gmail.com suffix. Tapping Next brings up the screen 
shown in Figure 5-3.
4.	 Enter your existing Gmail password and tap Next.
Go ahead and type your password. When you’re ready, tap Next on the  
keyboard.
You may get a pop-up reconfirming that you agree with the terms of use and all 
that legal stuff. Tap OK. You’ll see lots of flashing lights and whirling circles while 
your phone and your Gmail account get to know each other.
FIGURE 5-2: 
Add your 
account page.

CHAPTER 5  Sending and Receiving Email     77
If everything is correct, your phone and your account get acquainted and become 
best friends. After a few minutes, they are ready to serve your needs. There are 
even a few screens that tell you all the wonderful things that your Gmail account 
will do for you. Believe every word!
If you have a problem, you probably mistyped something. Try retyping your infor-
mation. From this point on, any email you get in your Gmail account will also 
appear on your phone!
Setting up a new Gmail account
If you need to set up a new Gmail account, you have a few more steps to follow. 
Before you get into the steps, think up a good user ID and password.
Gmail has been around for a while. That means all the good, simple email 
addresses are taken. Unless you plan to start using this email account as your 
main email, which you could do if you wanted, you’re probably best off if you pick 
some unusual combination of letters and numbers that you can remember for now 
to get through this process.
FIGURE 5-3: 
Enter your first 
and last name 
on this screen.

78     PART 2  Communications
When you have all of this ready, follow Steps 1 and 2 in the previous section, 
but tap the Or Create a New Account link when you get to the screen shown in  
Figure 5-2. From there, follow these steps:
1.	 Enter your first and last names on the screen and tap Next.
Google asks for your name in the screen shown in Figure 5-3. This is how 
Google personalizes any communications it has with you.
You may be tempted to use a fake name or some other clever two-word 
combination in place of a name. Don’t do it. You will still be getting email to Rita 
Book or Warren Peace long after the humor has worn off.
2.	 Enter the username you want to use with Gmail and tap Done.
On the screen shown in Figure 5-4, enter the username you want. Hopefully 
you get this name approved on the first shot.
If your first choice isn’t available, try again. There is no easy way to check 
before you go through these steps. Eventually, you hit on an unused ID, or you 
will use one of the suggestions in blue font. When you’re successful, it will 
congratulate you.
FIGURE 5-4: 
The Username 
screen.

CHAPTER 5  Sending and Receiving Email     79
3.	 Accept the terms and conditions of the account.
You may want a lawyer to review these terms and conditions. Or not. Basically, 
the terms are that you should be nice and not try to cheat anyone. Don’t abuse 
the privilege of having the account.
4.	 Prepare a security question and an alternate email address and tap Done 
or Skip.
If you forget your password, Google wants to verify that you’re really you and 
not someone pretending to be you. Google does this check by sending a 
­confirmation email to another account or sending a text to your phone. You 
can do this now or tap Skip to do it later.
After you tap Done, light flashes, and you see the screen working away. This pro-
cess usually takes less than two minutes. While you wait, you’ll see all kinds of 
messages that it’s getting ready to sync things. Don’t worry. I explain these mes-
sages in good time. For now, you can add any other email accounts you want by 
following the steps in the next section.
Working with non-Gmail email accounts
Your phone is set up to work with up to ten email accounts. If you have more than 
ten accounts, I’m thinking that you might have too much going on in your life. No 
phone, not even the Galaxy S7, can help you there!
I now cover the steps to adding your email accounts. Once you tell your phone all 
your email accounts, the Email screen will let you see the inbox of each account 
or combine all your email in a single inbox. You can choose which option works 
best for you.
Adding your first email account
To get started, have your email addresses and passwords ready. When you have 
them, go to your phone’s Home screen. Look for the Mail icon; it is an envelope 
with an @ on it (refer to Figure 5-1). This is probably on your Home screen as 
one of the four primary shortcuts just above the Device Function keys or in your 
application list.
1.	 Tap the Menu icon from the Email screen.
This brings up a menu like the one shown in Figure 5-5 with the options to set 
up an email account. If your email service come from Yahoo!, AOL, or Outlook, 
you can tap that button. It is then simply a matter of entering your email 
address and password. Otherwise, continue on.

80     PART 2  Communications
2.	 Tap the Add Others Account icon.
This is a generic way to enter lots of kinds of email accounts. If you have an 
email account on Yahoo!, AOL, Outlook.com, or another email service that is on 
your screen, you can tap that icon. However, the process and the result will be 
the same. Tapping one of these icons brings up a screen that looks like the 
image shown in Figure 5-6.
3.	 Carefully enter your full email account name and then enter your password 
in the second field.
Your email address should include the full shebang, including the @ sign and 
everything that follows it. Make sure to enter your password correctly, being 
careful with capitalization if your email server is case-sensitive (most are). If in 
doubt, select the option that lets you see your password.
4.	 Tap Next.
You see all kinds of options you can select. Just go with the default settings for 
now. This brings up the screen seen in Figure 5-7.
FIGURE 5-5: 
The menu for 
the Email app.

CHAPTER 5  Sending and Receiving Email     81
5.	 Select your desired Sync Settings and then tap Next.
You can select how often you want your phone and the email service to 
synchronize. A lot of thought and consideration has been put into the default 
settings. If you just want to get started, tap Next.
If you want to fine-tune things later, it is not hard to go back and adjust these 
settings. These settings are intended to be gentle on your data usage.
If you want images in email to download immediately, store older email 
messages on your phone, check to see whether you have new email all the 
time, you can change these settings on this page for this email account. If you 
know what you want that is different from the default settings, make the 
changes and then tap Next.
6.	 Enter a name for the new email account.
The next screen is seen in Figure 5-8. This gives you the option to call your 
email account something other than its address. You can always use the email 
address for the name, but I recommend choosing something shorter, like Joe’s 
MSN or My Hotmail.
FIGURE 5-6: 
The Add 
Account 
screen.

82     PART 2  Communications
7.	 Tap Done.
Using Figure 5-9 as an example, you can see that my account is now registered 
on my phone. It worked!
Adding additional email accounts
Once you have entered your first email account, there are a few different steps to 
add additional accounts.
1.	 Tap the More link at the top-right part of the screen.
This tap of the More link brings up the pop-up screen seen in Figure 5-10.
2.	 Tap Settings.
Tapping Settings brings up the screen seen in Figure 5-11.
3.	 Tap Add Account next to the green plus sign.
This brings you back to the Set up email screen seen back in Figure 5-5.
FIGURE 5-7: 
The Sync 
­Settings screen.

CHAPTER 5  Sending and Receiving Email     83
At this point you can add up to nine more accounts, and remember, you will be 
asked which email account you want to be your primary account. It is entirely 
up to you. You can send and receive email from all your accounts by selecting it, 
but only one can be the primary account used if you send an email from another 
application, such as the Contacts app.
Setting up a corporate email account
In addition to personal email accounts, you can add your work email account to 
your phone — if it’s based upon a Microsoft Exchange server, that is, and if it’s 
okay with your company’s IT department.
Before you get started, you need some information from the IT department of 
your company:
»
» The domain name of the office email server
»
» Your work email password
»
» The name of your exchange server
FIGURE 5-8: 
Naming your 
email account.

84     PART 2  Communications
If the folks in IT are okay with you using your phone to access its email service, 
your IT department will have no trouble supplying you with this information.

CHAPTER 5  Sending and Receiving Email     85
Before you set up your work email on your phone, make sure that you have per-
mission. If you do this without the green light from your company, and you end 
up violating your company’s rules, you could be in hot water. Increasing your 
productivity won’t be much help if you’re standing out in the parking lot holding 
all the contents of your office in a cardboard box.
Assuming that your company wants you to be more productive with no extra cost 
to the company, the process for adding your work email starts at your email Home 
screen seen in Figure 5-5.
1.	 From the email Home screen, tap the Corporate icon.
2.	 Enter your email address and password.
The Corporate screen is seen in Figure 5-12. It is similar to the screen shown in 
Figure 5-6, but this time, in Figure 5-12, I have closed the keypad and you can 
see the full screen.
3.	 Tap Manual Setup.
This brings up the screen seen in Figure 5-13.
The chances are that you haven’t got the foggiest notion what any of this 
means or what you are to do now.
FIGURE 5-11: 
The Email 
­Settings screen.

86     PART 2  Communications
4.	 Verify that your IT department is good with you having email on your own 
device and have them give you the necessary settings.
Seriously. It is increasingly common that a firm will give you access on your 
phone. At the same time, they do not generally circulate documents with how 
to make this happen. This would be a big security problem if anyone could get 
access. Save yourself the time and get help from IT.
Reading Email on Your Phone
In Figure 5-9, you can see how the email screen looks for what I have called My 
Personal Email. You can also set it up so that this screen is set up so that it com-
bines all your email into one inbox. At any given time, you might want to look at 
the accounts individually or all together.

CHAPTER 5  Sending and Receiving Email     87
To look at all your email in one large inbox, tap the downward pointing arrow next 
to the word Inbox and select Combined Inbox. This lists all your email in chrono-
logical order. To open any email message, just tap it.
If, on the other hand, you want to see just email from one account, tap the box at 
the top that says Combined Inbox. When you tap this icon, your phone will display 
all the individual email accounts. Tap on the account you want to focus on at the 
moment, and your phone will bring up your email in chronological order for just 
that email address.
Writing and Sending Email
After you set up the receiving part of email, the other important side is composing 
and sending email. At any time when you’re in an email screen, simply tap the 
Menu button to get a pop-up screen. From the pop-up menu, tap the Compose 
icon to open the email composition screen.
FIGURE 5-13: 
The Manual 
Setup screen

­corporate email 
accounts.

88     PART 2  Communications
Here’s the logic that determines which email account will send this email:
»
» If you’re in the inbox of an email account and you tap the Compose icon 
after tapping Menu, your phone sends the email to the intended recipient(s) 
through that account.
»
» If you’re in the combined inbox or some other part of the email app, your 
phone assumes that you want to send the email from the default email 
account that you selected when you registered your second (or additional) 
email account.
When you tap the Compose icon in the Menu pop-up menu, it tells you which 
account it will use. The Email composition screen shown in Figure 5-14 says this 
email will be coming from this account: galaxysfordummies@gmail.com.
As shown in this screen, the top has a stalwart To field, where you type the recipi-
ent’s address. You can also call up your contacts, a group, or your most recent

CHAPTER 5  Sending and Receiving Email     89
email addresses. (Read all about contacts in Chapter 6.) Tap the address or contact 
you want, and it populates the To field.
Below that, in the Subject field, is where you enter the email’s topic. And below 
that is the body of the message, with the default signature, Sent from my Samsung 
Galaxy S7, although your cellular carrier might have customized this signature.
At the top of the screen are three links:
»
» Attach: Tap this hyperlink to attach a file of any variety to your email.
»
» Send: Tap this link to send the email to the intended recipient(s).
»
» More: Tap this option, and you get the pop-up seen in Figure 5-15. This gives 
you the following options:
•	 Save in Drafts: This allows you to complete the email later without losing 
your work.
•	 Send email to myself: This is an alternative to saving the email in your 
Sent mail folder.
•	 Priority: This option signifies that this is more important that the average 
email to your recipients.
•	 Security options: You have some fancy, 007 options here. You can sign 
the document or encrypt it.
•	 Turn on Rich Text: To save data usage, email is sent in a default font. If 
you want to burn at little more data, you can get creative and add more 
elaborate fonts.

If you change your mind about sending an email message, you can just tap the 
Back key. If you’re partially done with the message, you’re asked whether you 
want to save it in your Drafts folder.
The Drafts folder works like the Drafts folder in your computer’s email program. 
When you want to continue working on a saved email, you open the Drafts folder, 
tap on it, and continue working.
Replying To and Forwarding Email
Replying to or forwarding the email that you get is a common activity. You can do 
this from your Email app. Figure 5-16 shows a typical open email message.
You can reply by tapping the icon with the return arrow at the bottom of the 
screen. If other people were copied on the email, you could tap the double return 
arrow to Reply all.
FIGURE 5-16:

CHAPTER 5  Sending and Receiving Email     91
When you tap either of these options, the Reply screen comes back with the To line 
populated by the sender’s email address (or addresses) and a blank space where 
you can leave your comments. (In the case of Figure 5-16, you could ask that your 
dad not send you any more jokes like these.)
To forward the email, tap the arrow pointing to the right above the word Forward 
and enter the addressee just as you do when sending a new email.

Managing Your 
Contacts
Y
ou’re probably familiar with using contact databases. Many cellphones 
automatically create one, or at least prompt you to create one. You also 
probably have a file of contacts on your work computer, made up of work 
email addresses and telephone numbers. And if you have a personal email account, 
you probably have a contact database of email accounts of friends and family 
members. If you’re kickin’ it old school, you might even keep a paper address 
book with names, addresses, and telephone numbers.
The problem with having all these contact databases is that it’s rarely ever as neat 
and tidy as I’ve just outlined. A friend might email you at work, so you have her in 
both your contact databases. Then her email address might change, and you update 
that information in your personal address book but not in your work one. Before long, 
you have duplicate and out-of-date contacts, and it’s hard to tell which is correct. 
How you include Facebook or LinkedIn messaging in your contact profile is unclear.
In addition to problems keeping all your contact databases current, it can be a 
hassle to migrate the database from your old phone. Some cellular carriers or 
firms have offered a service that converts your existing files to your new phone, 
but it’s rarely a truly satisfying experience. You end up spending a lot of time 
­correcting the assumptions it makes.
You now face that dilemma again with your Galaxy S7: deciding how to manage 
your contacts. This chapter gives you the advantages of each approach so that you 
Chapter 6

94     PART 2  Communications
can decide which one will work best for you. That way, you won’t have the frus-
tration of wishing you had done it another way before you put 500 of your best 
friends in the wrong filing system.
Using the Galaxy S7 Contacts App
Your phone wants you to be able to communicate with all the people you would 
ever want to in any way you know how to talk to them. This is a tall order, and 
your Galaxy S7 makes it as easy as possible. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if the 
technology implemented in the Contacts app becomes one of your favorite capa-
bilities of the phone. After all, your phone is there to simplify communication with 
friends, family, and coworkers, and the Contacts app on your phone makes it as 
easy as technology allows.
At the same time, this information is only as good as your contact database disci-
pline. The focus of this section is to help you help your phone help you.
Learning the Contacts App on your phone
The fact of the matter is, if you introduced your phone to your email accounts in 
Chapter 5, the Contacts list on your phone has all the contacts from each of your 
contact lists.
Take a look at it and see. From your Home screen, tap the Contacts icon.
If you haven’t created a Gmail account, synced your personal email, or created 
a contact when you sent a text or made a call, your Contacts list will be empty. 
Otherwise, you see a bunch of your contacts now residing on your phone, sorted 
alphabetically (as shown in Figure 6-1).
Along with the Contacts application that manages the data, this database does 
more than just store names, phone numbers, and email addresses. However, you 
can have the contact include any or all of the following information:
»
» All telephone numbers, including
•	 Mobile
•	 Home
•	 Work
•	 Work fax

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Contacts     95
•	 Pager
•	 Other
»
» Email addresses
•	 Home
•	 Work
•	 Mobile
»
» Instant Messaging addresses
»
» Company/organization
»
» Job title
»
» Nickname
»
» Mailing address for
•	 Home
•	 Work
•	 Another location
FIGURE 6-1: 
The 
Contacts list.

96     PART 2  Communications
»
» Any notes about this person
•	 Web address
•	 Birthday (or other significant event)
•	 A phonetic spelling of the name
As if all this weren’t enough, you can assign a specific ringtone to play when a 
particular person contacts you. I cover the steps to assign a music file to an indi-
vidual caller in Chapter 12.
Finally, you can assign a picture for the contact. It can be one out of your Gallery; 
you can take a new picture; or (as I discuss in Chapter 8) you can connect to a 
social network like Facebook and use that person’s profile picture.
Fortunately, the only essential information is a name. Every other field is optional 
and is only displayed if the field contains information to be displayed. Figure 6-2 
shows a lightly populated contact.

­populated

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Contacts     97
Deciding where to store your contacts
Before we get too far, it is important for you to decide the default option where 
you want to store your contacts. Deciding this now with the information this sec-
tion provides you will make your life much easier as you go forward. It is possible 
to combine contact databases, but even the best tools are imperfect.
The first time you try to save a new contact, the Contacts App will offer you a pop-
up screen, as seen in Figure 6-3. This lists the options you have and will take your 
first entry as the option you want as a default.
Whenever you save a new entry, you can manually switch to another of these 
databases. Save yourself some time and aggravation and decide now what you 
want to do. Here are your options on where to save new contacts:
»
» Within the memory of your phone
»
» On the SIM card inserted in your phone
»
» Within your Gmail account
»
» As a contact in one of your other accounts
FIGURE 6-3: 
Choosing a 
default for 
creating new 
contacts.

98     PART 2  Communications
Each of these four options has advantages and disadvantages. If you simply want 
my advice, I suggest using your Gmail account to store new contacts. If this satis-
fies you, skip to the next section on linking contacts from other sources. Read on 
if you need some context.
Here is the deal: If everything is working properly, all options work equally well. 
However, if you switch phones regularly, ever lose you phone, need to make sig-
nificant updates to your contacts, or are frequently out of wireless coverage, such 
as on an airplane, you should consider the options.
The first option mentioned involves storing your contacts within your phone. This 
is a great option, as long as you have your phone. However, there will come a day 
when Samsung (or HTC, or LG, and so on) has something faster and better, and 
you will want to upgrade. At that point, perhaps next year or in ten years, you will 
need to move your contacts to another location if you want to keep them. Plus, if 
you lose your phone, I sure hope that you have recently used one of the backup 
options I explore in Chapter 17.
The second option is to store your new contacts on your SIM card. The SIM card 
is familiar technology if your previous phone worked with AT&T or T-Mobile. 
Figure 6-4 shows a profile of a typical SIM card, next to a dime for scale, although 
yours probably has the logo of your cellular carrier nicely printed on the card. To 
the right of the SIM card is the newer micro SIM card. This is the same idea, but 
in a smaller package.
If your cellular carrier is Verizon, Sprint, or US Cellular, you may be confused. Your 
Galaxy S7 has a SIM card. What’s the story? These carriers use CDMA technology 
for voice and for some data features. Up to 3G, the phones using CDMA technol-
ogy and data services didn’t use a SIM card. Today, all carriers in the United States 
are implementing a super high-speed data technology called LTE, also called 4G. 
Because your phone is capable of LTE, you now have a SIM card.
FIGURE 6-4: 
A SIM card  
and a micro  
SIM card.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Contacts     99
The cool aspect of using your SIM card is that you can pluck it out of your existing 
phone and pop it in another phone and all your contacts come with you. It works 
this easily if you stay with an Android smartphone of recent vintage. It almost 
works this easily if you, say, switch back to a feature phone (as in the kind of 
phone that merely makes calls and texts and costs $1). Another advantage is that 
your SIM card does not rely on having a wireless connection to update changes.
The next option is to store new contacts on your Gmail account. What this means 
is that your new contacts are automatically copied from your phone to the Gmail 
account of Google servers. This keeps the records on your phone, but Google 
maintains a copy of this record in your Gmail account. You can make changes to a 
contact on your phone or on your PC.
The two reasons I recommend using your Gmail account are
»
» You can maintain these records with your full-sized keyboard rather than the 
smaller keyboard on your phone.
»
» It is easy to get back all these contacts on a new Android phone simply by tell-
ing the new phone your Gmail account. Because you will probably enter your 
Gmail account right away when you get a new phone, your contacts reappear 
quicker than the fourth option.
The fourth option is to store the contacts in one of your existing email accounts. 
This may be the best option if you already consider your email, either your per-
sonal or work account, to be the primary location where you store contacts. If 
you already have good database discipline with one of your email accounts, by all 
means, use this email account as the default place to store new contacts.
If this particular account you currently use for keeping your contacts is not set up 
yet on your phone, you can tap the Add New Account link shown in Figure 6-3 to 
go through the process described in Chapter 5 to set up a new email account.
Linking Contacts on your phone
The Contacts list is smart. Allow me to explain some of the things that are going on.
Say your best friend is Bill Boyce. You sent Bill a text earlier to let him know about 
your new phone. You followed the instructions on how to send a text in Chapter 4 
and entered his telephone number. You took it to the next step and tapped Add 
Contact. When you were prompted to add his name, you did. Now your phone has 
a contact, “Bill Boyce.”

100     PART 2  Communications
Then you linked your email. Of course your buddy Bill is in your email Contacts 
list. So while you were reading this chapter, several things happened. First, your 
phone and your Gmail account synced. Your phone thinks about it and figures this 
must be the same person. It automatically combines all the information in one 
entry on your phone!
Then your phone automatically updates your Gmail account. On the left side of 
Figure 6-5, you see the Google logo just beneath Bill’s email address. This contact 
is synced with your Gmail account. You didn’t have to do anything to make this 
happen.
Your phone noticed that Bill’s work number was in your email contact informa-
tion, but the mobile phone number you used to text him was not. No problem! 
Now the contact on your phone includes both the information you had in your 
email contact as well as his cellular phone.
Now, as slick as this system is, it isn’t perfect. In this scenario, both contacts have 
the same first and last name. However, if the same person also goes by a differ-
ent name, you have to link these contacts. For example, if you created a contact 
for Bill Boyce, but your email refers to him as William D. Boyce, your phone will 
assume that these are two different people.
FIGURE 6-5: 
Two contacts 
for the same 
person.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Contacts     101
No problem, though. Do you see the chain links icon in Figure 6-5 in the box 
that says Connected via? Here are the steps to link the two contacts for the same 
person:
1.	 From a contact, tap on the chain icon.
This brings up the pop-up shown in Figure 6-6.
Choose the contact whose name you want to be the primary name. For 
example, I tapped the link on the Bill Boyce contact, which is saved in Gmail. 
This will be the name used on the combined contact going forward.
2.	 Tap the Link Another Contact link at the bottom of the screen.
Your phone will try to help you with some suggestions, as shown in Figure 6-7. If 
it gets it all wrong, you can just find the other contact by searching alphabetically.
FIGURE 6-6: 
The Linking 
Page for Bill 
Boyce.

102     PART 2  Communications
3.	 Tap the contact you want joined.
In this case, the second guess, William D. Boyce, is the one you want. Tap the 
selection box to the left of his name. The result is shown in Figure 6-8.
4.	 Now tap the link that says Link in the upper-right corner of the screen.
This combined link will now have all the information on this one person.
Let no man put this link asunder (unless you made a mistake and want to change 
it. Then go tap the chain icon to break the link).
FIGURE 6-7: 
Some linking 
suggestions.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Contacts     103
Creating Contacts within Your Database
Your phone is out there trying to make itself the ultimate contact database with as 
little effort on your part as possible. The interesting thing is that the salesperson 
in the cellular store probably didn’t explain this to you in detail. It’s a subtle-but- 
important capability that’s hard to communicate on the sales floor. Here’s what 
happens.
Whenever you make or receive a call, send or receive an email, or send or receive 
a text, your phone looks up the telephone number or email address from which 
the message originated to check whether it has seen that address before. If it has, 
it has all the other information on that person ready. If it doesn’t recognize the 
originating telephone number or email, it asks whether you want to make it a new 
contact or update an existing one. What could be easier?
FIGURE 6-8: 
The Linked 
contacts.

104     PART 2  Communications
Adding contacts as you dial
When you get a call, a text, or an email from someone who isn’t in your contacts, 
you’re given the option to create a profile for that person. The same is true when 
you initiate contact with someone who isn’t in your Contacts list. Chapter 3 shows 
you the empty and full dialing screens. The image on the left in Figure 6-9 shows 
the phone trying its best to anticipate the person you are in the process of calling, 
and, if it is not saved already, the image on the right shows how it offers you the 
option to add this number to your contacts.
When you tap Add to Contacts, you’re immediately given the option to create a con-
tact or update an existing contact. Your phone doesn’t know whether this is a new 
number for an existing contact or a totally new person. Rather than make an assump-
tion (as lesser phones on the market would do), your phone asks you whether you 
need to create a new profile or add this contact information to an existing profile.
Keep in mind that if you are calling an existing contact and your phone guesses 
the right person, you can save yourself time and tap the phone to dial.
FIGURE 6-9: 
The dialing 
screens in 
­process and 
when there is a 
new number.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Contacts     105
Say that you want to enter this number as a new contact. You follow these steps:
1.	 Tap the Add a Contact link.
It will first check to see whether you want to create a new contact or add this 
number to an existing contact. The Add to Contacts pop-up as seen in Figure 6-10 
gives you these options. If this is a new number for an existing contact, this 
pop-up saves you from having to link contacts.
2.	 Tap the Create Contact link.
Tapping this link brings up a new contact page. An example is seen in Figure 6-11.
FIGURE 6-10: 
The Add  
to Contacts 
pop-up.
FIGURE 6-11: 
A partially 
populated 
contact.

106     PART 2  Communications
The number is already populated. You just need to fill in the correct name plus 
any other information that you want associated with this person.
3.	 When you’re done typing in the information for this contact, tap Save at the 
top of the contact.
Figure 6-11 shows the Save button at the top of the screen.
Adding contacts manually
Adding contacts manually involves taking an existing contact database and adding 
its entries to your phone, one profile at a time. (This option, a last resort, was the 
only option for phones back in the day.)
1.	 Tap the Contacts icon.
Doing so brings up the list of existing contacts shown in Figure 6-1.
2.	 Tap the Add Contacts icon (the + [plus] sign next to a silhouette).
This icon is seen in Figure 6-12. Tapping it will bring up a blank contact page 
with nothing populated.­
3.	 Fill in the information you want to include.
4.	 When you’re done entering data, tap Save at the top of the screen.
The profile is now saved. Repeat the process for as many profiles as you want 
to create.
FIGURE 6-12: 
The Add  
Contacts icon.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Contacts     107
How Contacts Make Life Easy
Phew. Heavy lifting over. After you populate the profiles of dozens or hundreds of 
contacts, you’re rewarded with a great deal of convenience.
Start by tapping a contact. You see that person’s profile, as shown in Figure 6-13.
All the options you have for contacting this contact are but a simple tap away:
»
» Tap the green telephone next to the number to dial that number.
»
» Tap the amber message icon to send a text.
»
» Tap the email icon to create an email.
About the only thing that tapping on a data field won’t do is print an envelope for 
you if you tap the mailing address!
FIGURE 6-13:

108     PART 2  Communications
Playing Favorites
Over the course of time, you’ll probably find yourself calling some people more 
than others. It would be nice to not have to scroll through your entire contacts 
database to find those certain people. Contacts allow you to place some of your 
contacts into a Favorites list for easy access.
From within the Contacts app, open the profile and notice the star next to that 
person’s name (refer to Figure 6-13). To the right of the contact name is a star. If 
that star is gold, that contact is a Favorite. If not, then not.
To make a contact into a star, tap the blank outline of the star. To demote a con-
tact from stardom without deleting, tap the gold star.
You won’t immediately see a difference in your contacts other than the appear-
ance of the gold star. When you open your phone, however, this contact now 
appears under your Favorites tab. The Favorites tab is like a mini-contact data-
base. It looks similar in structure to your regular contact database, but it includes 
only your favorites.

f you’re like most people, one of the reasons you got a smartphone is because 
you want Internet access on the go. You don’t want to have to wait until you 
get back to your laptop or desktop to find the information you need online. 
You want to be able to access the Internet even when you’re away from a Wi-Fi 
hotspot — and that’s exactly what you can do with your Galaxy S7 phone. In this 
chapter, I show you how.
The browser that comes standard with your Galaxy S7 works almost identically to 
the browser that’s currently on your PC. You see many familiar toolbars, includ-
ing the Favorites bar and search engine. And the mobile version of the browser 
includes tabs that allow you to open multiple Internet sessions simultaneously.
This chapter goes into much more detail on using the Internet browser on your 
Galaxy S7, as well as the websites you can access from your phone, and discusses 
some of the trade-offs you can make when viewing a web page.
Chapter 7

112     PART 3  Live on the Internet: Going Mobile
Starting the Browser
You have three options for getting access to information from the Internet via 
your Galaxy S7 phone. Which one you use is a personal choice. The choices are
»
» Use the regular web page: This option involves accessing a web page via 
its regular address (URL) and having the page come up on your screen. The 
resulting text may be small.
»
» Use the mobile web page: Many websites offer a mobile version of their 
regular web page. This is an abbreviated version of the full website that can 
be more easily read on a mobile device.
»
» Find out whether a mobile app is associated with the web page: Many 
websites have found that it is most expedient to write a mobile application 
to access the information on its website. The app reformats the web page to 
fit better on a mobile screen — a convenient option if you plan to access this 
website regularly. I cover the trade-offs about this option later in the section 
“Deciding Between Mobile Browsing and Mobile Apps” and explore how to 
find and install such apps in Chapter 8.
With this background, head to the Internet. On your Galaxy S7 phone, you may 
have a few choices on how to get there. Figure 7-1 shows three possible icons that 
can get you there. Tap any of these, and you can start surfing.
If you want a little more understanding as to why there are multiple options, read 
the nearby sidebar on Internet terminology.
For your purpose, tap either the Chrome icon or the Google icon to get started. 
These icons will typically be on the Home screen. Alternatively, tap the Applica-
tion icon and find the Chrome or Google icon.
If you love Bing, you are not out of luck. Bing is either on your phone, or you can 
get it installed (I cover how to install things like Bing in Chapter 8). For now, just 
stay with Chrome and Google. Things on other browsers and search engines are 
mostly similar, and choosing the Chrome/Google pair simplifies things.
FIGURE 7-1: 
Possible paths 
to the Internet 
on your  
Galaxy S7.

CHAPTER 7  You’ve Got the Whole (Web) World in Your Hands     113
As long as you’re connected to the Internet (that is, you are either near a Wi-Fi 
hotspot or in an area where you have cellular service), your home page appears. If 
you tap the Google icon, it will be Google. If you tap Chrome, your default home 
page could be blank or the Google home page, but many cellular carriers set their 
phones’ home pages to their own websites.
If you’re out of coverage range or you turned off the cellular and Wi-Fi radios 
because you turned on Airplane mode, you get a pop-up screen letting you know 
that there is no Internet connection. (Read about Airplane mode in Chapter 2.)
If you should be in coverage but are not connected or when you get off the air-
plane, you can re-establish your connections by pulling down the Notification 
screen and either tapping the Wi-Fi icon at the top or turning off Airplane mode.
Accessing Mobile (or Not) Websites
The browser on your phone is designed to work like the browser on your PC. At 
any time, you can enter a web address (URL) by tapping the text box at the top of 
the screen. You can try this by typing in the address of your favorite website and 
seeing what happens.
BASIC INTERNET TERMINOLOGY  
FOR DUMMIES
The term Internet access can mean a few different things. In some circumstances, the 
word Internet can mean a web browser. A web browser is an app that will display pages 
on the Internet. In other circumstances, the word Internet may refer to a search engine. 
You use a search engine to find either information you are seeking or to bring you to a 
website. Then you use a web browser to look at the information. Chances are the web 
browser on your phone that you will use is an app from Google called Chrome.
The chances are that the search engine you use on your phone is Google, but it may 
be the search engine for Microsoft called Bing. The goal with your phone is to get you 
where you want with minimal fuss. It is easier for the people that are bringing you this 
phone and service (Samsung, Google, and your wireless carrier) to give you three icons 
that essentially point to the same thing than to explain the terminology. Tapping the 
Internet icon, the Chrome icon, or the Google icon will most likely bring up the Chrome 
web browser.

114     PART 3  Live on the Internet: Going Mobile
For example, the page seen in Figure 7-2 is the regular version of the website 
Refdesk.com.
As you can see, the website is all there. Also as you can see, the text is very small. 
This particular website is designed to take you to a lot of useful links throughout 
the Internet, so this is an extreme example of a regular website.
While this text is crisp and bright on your beautiful screen, it is still small. You 
can stretch and pinch to find the information you need. (Stretching and pinching 
are hand movements you can use to enlarge/shrink what you see onscreen, as 
covered in Chapter 2.) With a little bit of practice, you can navigate your familiar 
websites with ease.
The other option is to find the mobile version of a website. As a comparison,  
Figure 7-3 shows the mobile version of Refdesk.com. It has fewer pictures, the 
text is larger, and the mobile version loads faster— but it’s less flashy.
FIGURE 7-2: 
The regular 
version of 
the website 
Refdesk.com.

CHAPTER 7  You’ve Got the Whole (Web) World in Your Hands     115
In the case of RefDesk, you can get to the mobile version by entering m.refdesk.
com into the text block at the top from the software keyboard. Refdesk.com is far 
from the only website to offer a mobile version. Many sites —from Facebook to 
Flickr to Gmail to Wikipedia — offer mobile versions.
So how do you get to the mobile websites? If a website has a mobile version, your 
phone browser will usually bring it up. Samsung has gone out of its way to work 
to make the web experience on the Galaxy S7 phone as familiar as possible to what 
you experience on your PC.
The most common difference between the address of a mobilized website and a 
regular one is /mobile.com at the end of the address. For example, the mobile 
version of Amazon.com is www.amazon.com/mobile.
If your phone doesn’t automatically bring up the mobile version of a site, the sim-
plest way to find it is to search for the desired site along with the term mobile. For 
example, the first option you get from searching for IMDb mobile on your phone 
is the mobilized website for the Internet Movie Database.

Getting Around in the Browser
If you tapped one of the icons seen in Figure 7-1, you opened up the browser. Now 
would be a good time to try some of your favorite websites. Go ahead and tap in a 
few website addresses and see how they look!
One of the early goals for browsers that work on smartphones was to replicate the 
experience of using the Internet on a PC. For the most part, the browsers on your 
phone achieve that goal, even if you probably need to practice your zooming and 
panning.
One popular capability of PC browsers is the ability to open multiple tabs. This 
allows you to quickly jump between sessions of, say, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, 
and Wikipedia by clicking on a tab. If you had only one tab, your browser would 
need to wait as the website’s home page was reloaded.
If you want to have multiple tabs open simultaneously, you will need to take a 
couple of steps to change the settings. If you can handle only one browsing ­session 
at time, feel free to skip to the next section on bookmarks.
1.	 From the browser screen, tap the Menu icon.
Tapping the Menu icon, the three vertical dots to the right of the website 
address, brings up the menu options seen in Figure 7-4.
2.	 Tap Settings.
Tapping the Settings brings up the screen shown in Figure 7-5.
FIGURE 7-4: 
The Chrome 
Menu options.

3.	 Tap the Merge tabs and apps setting.
Tapping this setting brings up the screen shown in Figure 7-6.
4.	 Tap the toggle switch to the off position to get multiple tabs.
Tapping the toggle switch turns off this option. Turning off the option is 
necessary to see multiple tabs. Figure 7-7 shows the options.

The tab counter tells you how many tabs are open. Because you just enabled the 
capability to have multiple tabs, there is only one. To add other tabs, tap the tab 
count box. This brings up a screen like the one shown on the left in Figure 7-8.

If you just want a new window for a second browser tab, tap the + (plus) sign in 
the upper-left corner of the screen. You get a second browser screen. The right 
screen shows RefDesk in the second tab. You navigate among the multiple tabs by 
swiping up or down. If you just want to close an open tab, tap the x in that tab’s 
upper-right corner. It will disappear.
Using Bookmarks
As convenient as it is to type URLs or search terms with the keyboard, you’ll find 
it’s usually faster to bookmark a web address that you visit frequently. Making 
bookmarks is a handy way to create a list of favorite sites that you want to access 
over and over again.
A bookmark is roughly the equivalent of a Favorite on a Microsoft Internet Explorer 
browser.
Adding bookmarks
When you want to add a website to your bookmark list, simply visit the site. From 
there, follow these steps:
1.	 Tap the Menu options icon.
This brings up the screen shown earlier in Figure 7-4.
2.	 Tap the outline of a star.
This brings up the screen seen in Figure 7-9.
3.	 Decide what to name your bookmark and tap Next.
The first textbox is the name you want to give to your bookmark. In this case, 
the default is Conditions & Forecast – WeatherBug.com. You can choose to 
shorten it to just WeatherBug, or anything you want to call it. When ready, tap 
Next on the keyboard.
The second textbox is the web address (URL). You probably want to leave this 
one alone.
4.	 Tap the Save button at the bottom-right corner of the screen.
This puts a thumbnail of the website in your Bookmark file. This is shown  
in Figure 7-10.

120     PART 3  Live on the Internet: Going Mobile
You access this screen through the Menu options shown in Figure 7-4. The next 
time you come to Bookmarks, you can tap this thumbnail, and this page will 
refresh and come up in its own window.
Bookmark housekeeping
Bookmarks are cool and convenient, but you don’t always want to save them 
forever. When a bookmark has served its purpose, rather than have it take up 
prime real estate on your Bookmarks screen, you can delete it. Press and hold the 
thumbnail of the website you want to delete. Doing so brings up a pop-up like the 
one shown in Figure 7-11.
To delete a bookmark, tap Delete bookmark. Your phone confirms that this is 
indeed what you want to do. Tap Yes, and the bookmark is gone.
On the other hand, say you really like this site. You can make it your home page. 
Tap Set as Homepage. Boom. Done. It’s now your home page.
FIGURE 7-9:

screen for your 
new addition.

CHAPTER 7  You’ve Got the Whole (Web) World in Your Hands     121
Deciding Between Mobile Browsing  
and Mobile Apps
When you open the browser, you can use any search engine you want (for example, 
Bing or Yahoo!). This is a very familiar approach from your experience with PCs. 
However, you may get very tired of all the pinching and stretching of the screen.

122     PART 3  Live on the Internet: Going Mobile
Many companies are aware of this. What they have done is to develop a mobile app 
that provides you the same information as is available on their website that is for-
matted for a smartphone screen. Companies in particular will put the information 
from their website in a mobile app and then add some important mobile features.
For example, it is very convenient to order a custom-made pizza from the website 
of a national pizza chain. You can order your desired variety of crusts and top-
pings. The website version also offers directions to the nearest store. The mobile 
app can take this one step further and give you turn-by-turn directions as you 
drive to pick up your pizza.
This capability of providing turn-by-turn directions makes no sense for a desk-
top PC. This capability could make sense for a laptop, but a few laptops have 
GPS receivers built in. It is also too cumbersome and probably unsafe to rely on  
turn-by-turn directions from a laptop. It is much easier to get turn-by-turn 
directions over a smartphone.
This is just one example where downloading a mobile app offers a superior expe-
rience. The best part is you get to choose what works for you on your Galaxy S7.

O
ne of the things that makes smartphones (such as the phones based 
on the Google Android platform) different from regular mobile phones 
is that you can download better apps than what comes standard on the 
phone. Most traditional cellphones come with a few simple games and basic apps. 
Smartphones usually come with better games and apps. For example, on your 
Galaxy S7 phone, you get a more sophisticated Contact Manager, an app that can 
play digital music (MP3s), basic maps, and texting tools.
To boot, you can download even better apps and games for phones based on the 
Google Android platform. Many apps are available for your Galaxy S7 phone, and 
that number will only grow over time.
So where do you get all these wonderful apps? The main place to get Android 
apps is the Google Play Store. You might be happy with the apps that came with 
your phone, but look into the Play Store and you’ll find apps you never knew you 
needed and suddenly won’t be able to live without.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the Google Play Store and give you a taste of 
what you find there.
Chapter 8

124     PART 3  Live on the Internet: Going Mobile
Exploring the Play Store:  
The Mall for Your Phone
The Play Store is set up and run by Google, mainly for people with Android 
phones. Adding an app to your phone is similar to adding software to your PC. 
In both cases, a new app (or software) makes you more productive, adds to your  
convenience, and/or entertains you for hours on end — sometimes for free. Not 
a bad deal.
There are some important differences, however, between installing software on a 
PC and getting an app on a cellphone:
»
» Smartphone apps need to be more stable than computer software 
because of their greater potential for harm. If you buy an app for your 
PC and find that it’s unstable (for example, it causes your PC to crash), sure, 
you’ll be upset. If you were to buy an unstable app for your phone, though, 
you could run up a huge phone bill or even take down the regional cellphone 
network. Can you hear me now?
»
» There are multiple smartphone platforms. These days, it’s pretty safe to 
assume that computer software will run on a PC or a Mac or both. On the 
other hand, because of the various smartphone platforms out there, differ-
ent versions within a given platform aren’t always compatible. The Play Store 
ensures that the app you’re buying will work with your version of phone.
Getting to the Store
You can access the Play Store through your Galaxy S7 phone’s Play Store app or 
through the Internet. The easiest way to access the Play Store is through the Play 
Store app on your Galaxy S7 phone. The icon is shown in Figure 8-1.
FIGURE 8-1: 
The Play  
Store icon.

CHAPTER 8  Playing in Google’s Play Store     125
If the Play Store app isn’t already on your Home screen, you can find it in your 
Apps list. To open it, simply tap the icon.
When you tap the Play Store icon, you’re greeted by the screen looking something 
like what is shown in Figure 8-2.
As new apps become available, the highlighted apps will change, and the Home 
page will change from one day to the next.
In addition, the good folks at Google spend a lot of time thinking about what is the 
best way to help the hundreds of millions of Android users find the best applica-
tion from the selection of 1.8 million apps.
This is no small task. Some of those users are very experienced and know just 
what they want. Others are walking in the door for the first time while still others 
are just coming to browse and see whether anything strikes their fancy.
FIGURE 8-2: 
The Play Store 
home page.

126     PART 3  Live on the Internet: Going Mobile
The goal for Google is to make every user who comes in find what they want. The 
goal in this book is to give you enough information so that you can be comfortable 
downloading your first app and then comfortable finding other interesting apps 
as you become more familiar with the layout.
Seeing What’s Available: Shopping  
for Android Apps
The panorama that exists for the Google Play home page seen in Figure 8-2 of 
is very extensive. You can swipe to the right a long way and you can swipe down 
dozens of levels. Take a look at the structure of Figure 8-2.
Do not be surprised if you open up the Play Store home page one day and find 
that it has a completely different layout. Google tries different formats from time 
to time to solve one problem or another and keep things fresh. The chances are 
good that the lower level categories are still there, and you can find what you  
are looking for, even if the structure described in this chapter is no longer exactly 
accurate.
Figure 8-2 shows three levels of categories. The Top Level categories are
»
» Apps & Games: Apps and Games are files you download where you are an 
active participant in their use. These files can be for productivity, information, 
social connection, or enjoyment.
»
» Entertainment: Rather than having the concept of using, this group involves 
downloading files that entertain or educate you as a passive recipient, such as 
digital books, magazines, and movies.
This distinction may seem a little theoretical at this point, but hang in there. An 
example may help things become clearer.
Say that you want to listen to The Beatle’s White Album later today on the bus 
home. You can buy the album in the Entertainment area of the Play Store. When 
you are on the bus, you could use the Play Music app that came with your phone 
to bring up and play the White Album.

CHAPTER 8  Playing in Google’s Play Store     127
Say that the app Play Music does not do it for you. You can download 103 free 
music apps and pay for another 132 that allow you to listen to music. You may 
ask, “Why you would pay for something that you already have for free?” Good 
question.
Some music apps have a more sophisticated filing system for your music, which is 
handy if you have a large music library. Others give you an equalizer that increases 
the bass notes. Another one gives you exciting visuals on the screen that corre-
sponds with the music. Beside, these cost only a dollar or two. There are no judg-
ments here. Buy and use what you like.
Getting back to the original point, you buy the music player app in the Apps and 
Games Section to play the music and the music file for the White Album in Enter-
tainment, which is essentially unchanged since 1968.
Subcategories for Apps and Games
Once you have decided that you want to look at Apps and Games, you see the 
­following options when you tap the link:
»
» Top Charts: These are the best-selling apps. This is often a good indication 
that you may want to give it a try.
»
» Games: These are all the types and flavors of games that can run on your 
phone, from simple kids games, exotic multiplayer games with alternative 
realities, and every kind of challenge in between.
»
» Categories: This option takes you to a hierarchy of application types that 
is useful if you already know what you want to add. There is more on these 
­different categories later in this chapter.
»
» Family: If you’re looking for apps suitable for the kids, you can go here.
»
» Editors’ Choice: While relying on sales volumes in Top Charts is one way to 
find apps you may find valuable, this section is curated, hopefully with people 
who think like you.
Subcategories for Entertainment
There are lots and lots of options for entertainment in this section. They are 
­categorized as follows:
»
» Movies and TV: As with music, you can download multimedia files and view 
your favorite movies and TV shows. You can watch these on your Galaxy S7’s 
screen. More on this in Chapter 12.

128     PART 3  Live on the Internet: Going Mobile
»
» Music: You can buy your digital music at the Play Store. I talk more about 
­buying music in Chapter 12.
»
» Books: Have you been thinking about getting an e-reader, such as an Amazon 
Kindle? Before you spend your hard-earned cash on one of these e-readers, 
take a look at the book library here and see whether you like reading on your 
phone! If you like the way the Kindle works, both are available as apps you can 
download and use to access your account on Amazon.com.
»
» Newsstand: Same idea as with books, only this category is for periodicals.
Curated categories
Below the subcategories are rows of curated categories. These are apps grouped by 
some expert to present you options in a logical sequence. Figure 8-2 shows New + 
Updated Games. When you scroll down, you’ll find dozens of rows, which include 
such categories as Must-Have Tools, Lifestyle Apps, and Shopping Apps.
If you find a row that you like, you can start scrolling to the right to see the 
options within that curated category. Hopefully, the curator thinks like you do 
and can offer you lots of suggestions. This is particularly handy if you’re not sure 
what you want.
The timeless categories  
for Apps and Games
Google is doing its best to get you to find the best app for you among its inven-
tory of hundreds of thousands of choices. Today’s version of the Play Store has a 
link called Categories where you can start digging by app or game type. While the 
names of these categories evolve slightly over time, the following are descriptions 
that should help you navigate this particular area:
»
» Games: Your Galaxy S7 phone takes interactive gaming to a new level. Games 
in this section of the Play Store fall into the following categories:
•	 Arcade and Action: Think of games that are based on what you find in 
arcades: shooting games, racing games, and other games of skill and/or 
strategy.
•	 Brain and Puzzle: Think crossword puzzles, Sudoku, and other word or 
number games.

CHAPTER 8  Playing in Google’s Play Store     129
•	 Cards and Casino: Find an electronic version of virtually every card or casino 
game. (If you know of any game that’s missing, let me know so that I can 
write the app and sell it to the three people who play it.)
•	 Casual: This crossover category includes simpler games, some of which are 
also arcade, action, or cards, but are distinguished by the ease with which 
you can pick them up, play them, and then put them down. Solitaire may 
be the most widespread example of a casual game.
»
» Apps: The non-games fall into many subcategories:
•	 Comics: These apps are meant to be funny. Hopefully, you find something 
that tickles your funnybone.
•	 Communication: Yes, the Galaxy S7 phone comes with many communi-
cations apps, but these Play Store apps enhance what comes with the 
phone — for example, tools that automatically send a message if you’re 
running late to a meeting or text you if your kids leave a defined area.
•	 Entertainment: Not games per se, but these apps are still fun: trivia, horo-
scopes, and frivolous noisemaking apps. (These also include Chuck Norris 
facts. Did you know that Chuck Norris can divide by 0?)
•	 Finance: This is the place to find mobile banking apps and tools to make 
managing your personal finances easier.
•	 Health: This is a category for all apps related to mobile medical apps, 
including calorie counters, fitness tracking, and tools to help manage 
chronic conditions, such as diabetes.
•	 Lifestyle: This category is a catchall for apps that involve recreation or spe-
cial interests, like philately or bird-watching.
•	 Maps & Search: Many apps tell you where you are and how to get to where 
you want to go. Some are updated with current conditions, and others are 
based on static maps that use typical travel times.
•	 Multimedia: The Galaxy S7 phone comes with the music and video services, 
but nothing says you have to like them. You might prefer offerings that are 
set up differently or have a selection of music that isn’t available elsewhere.
•	 News & Weather: You’ll find a variety of apps that allow you to drill down till 
you get just the news or weather that’s more relevant to you than what’s 
available on your extended Home screen.
•	 Productivity: These apps are for money management (such as a tip  
calculator), voice recording (such as a stand-alone voice recorder),  
and time management (for example, an electronic to-do list).

130     PART 3  Live on the Internet: Going Mobile
•	 Reference: These apps include a range of reference books, such as diction-
aries and translation guides. Think of this section as similar to the refer-
ence section of your local library and bookstore.
•	 Shopping: These apps help you with rapid access to mobile shopping sites 
or do automated comparison shopping.
•	 Social: These are the social networking sites. If you think you know them 
all, check here just to be sure. Of course, you’ll find Facebook, LinkedIn, 
Twitter, and Pinterest, but you’ll also find dozens of other sites that are 
more narrowly focused and offer apps for the convenience of their users.
•	 Software Libraries: Computers of all sizes come with software libraries to 
take care of special functions, such as tools to manage ringtones, track app 
performance, and protect against malware.
•	 Sports: You can find sports sites to tell you the latest scores and analyses in 
this part of the Play Store.
•	 Themes: Your phone comes with color schemes or themes. This part of the 
Play Store offers a broader selection.
•	 Tools: Some of these are widgets that help you with some fun capabilities. 
Others are more complicated and help you get more functionality from 
your phone.
•	 Travel: These apps are useful for traveling, including handy items, such as 
currency translations and travel guides.
Many of your favorite websites are now offering apps that are purpose-built for 
your phone. Chapter 7 talks about how you can access websites on your phone. You 
can use the full site with your high-resolution screen or use the mobile version. 
A third alternative can be an app that makes the information you want from your 
phone even easier to access.
Each app category comes with the apps divided into the following categories:
»
» Top Free: All apps in the Top Free category are available at no charge.
»
» Top New Free: This option gets you out in front of the curve to find the best 
new free apps before the unwashed masses find them.
»
» Top Paid: All apps in this category charge a fee.
»
» Top Grossing: These apps are both popular and cost money. This is often a 
good indication that the app is really good, or at least that it has a crack mar-
keting team. (If the app is not good, the customer comments will show that 
right away.)

CHAPTER 8  Playing in Google’s Play Store     131
»
» Top New Paid: All apps in this category charge a fee and are also new.
»
» Trending: Our friends at Google show the apps that are catching on. It’s worth 
considering the apps that reside in this category.
»
» Featured: These apps are relatively new and might or might not charge you 
to download and use them.
In general, you’ll probably want to see what you get with a free app before you 
spend money on the commercial equivalent. Many software companies know this 
and offer a lower-feature version for free and an enhanced version for a charge. 
Enjoy the free-market mechanisms on this site and never feel regret for enjoying 
a free app.
Free apps are great. But don’t be afraid of buying any apps that you’re going to use 
frequently. Apps usually cost very little, and the extra features may be worth it. 
Some people (including me) have an irrational resistance to paying $1.99 monthly 
for something they use all the time. Frankly, this is a little silly. Let’s all be ratio-
nal and be willing to pay a little bit for the services we use.
Installing and Managing an Android App
To make the process of finding and downloading an app less abstract, I show you 
how to download and install one in particular as an example: the Facebook for 
Android app.
Downloading the Facebook app
Follow these steps to add this app:
1.	 Tap the Play Store icon.
2.	 In the Query box, type Facebook.
Doing so brings up a drop-down screen like the one shown in Figure 8-3.
As you can see in the search results, several options include the word 
Facebook. The other lines in the Apps section are for apps that include the 
word Facebook. These are typically for apps that enhance Facebook in their 
own ways — as of this moment, 112,160 of them. Rather than go through 
these one by one, stick with the one with the Facebook icon.

132     PART 3  Live on the Internet: Going Mobile
3.	 Tap the anywhere in the box with the Facebook logo.
When you tap the box, it brings up the screen shown in Figure 8-4.
Before continuing to the next step, I want to point out some important 
elements on this page:
•	 Title Line: The top section has the formal name of the app just above the 
green Install button. After you click this to download and install the app, 
you see some other options. I give some examples later in this chapter.
•	 Description: This tells you what the app does.
•	 What’s New: This information is important if you have a previous version 
of this app. Skip this section for now.
•	 Screen Captures: These representative screens are a little too small to 
read, but they do add some nice color to the page.
•	 Feedback Statistics: This particular app has about 4.0 stars out of 5. That’s 
not bad at all. The other numbers tell you how many folks have voted, how 
many have downloaded this app, the date it was released, and the size of 
the app in MB.
FIGURE 8-3: 
The Facebook 
Search results.

CHAPTER 8  Playing in Google’s Play Store     133
•	 All Reviews: This section gets into more details about what people 
thought of the app beyond the star ranking.
•	 More by Facebook: The app developer in this case is Facebook. If you like 
the style of a particular developer, this section tells you what other apps 
that developer offers.
•	 Similar Apps: Just in case you are not sure about this, the good folks at 
Google offer some alternatives.
•	 Users Also Installed: Play Store tells you the names of other apps down-
loaded by the customers who downloaded this app. It’s a good indicator of 
what else you may like.
•	 Developer: This section gives you contact information for the developer of 
this app.
•	 Google Play Content: This is how you tell the Play Store whether this app 
is naughty or nice.
4.	 Tap the dark green button that says Install.
You see the progress of the app downloading process. When the app is all 
there, it begins the installation process.
At some point in the process, most apps give you a pop-up to let you know 
what information from your phone that the app will use. This is to give you an 
idea on how this particular app may affect your privacy.
FIGURE 8-4:

app screen in

134     PART 3  Live on the Internet: Going Mobile
Facebook is a special case when it comes to permissions. It touches practically 
every capability on your phone. Its extensive permission screen is seen in 
Figure 8-5.
Most apps are not as intimately connected to your life. These involve far  
fewer permissions. Some involve only one. For example, Figure 8-6 shows  
the permissions pop-up for the WeatherBug app. As the name implies, 
WeatherBug tells you of weather conditions and forecasts. It works best  
when it knows where you are.
FIGURE 8-5:

screen.
FIGURE 8-6: 
The Weather-
Bug permis-
sions pop-up.

CHAPTER 8  Playing in Google’s Play Store     135
Chapter 1 discusses the option to prevent an app from having access to your 
location information. I mention that you can allow apps to know where you are 
on a case-by-case basis. Here is where that issue comes up. Each app asks you 
for permission to access information, such as your location. If you don’t want 
the app to use that information or share it somehow, here’s where you find out 
whether the app uses this information. You may be able to limit the amount of 
location information. If you’re not comfortable with that, you should decline 
the app in its entirety.
However, in the case of WeatherBug, you can manually enter the location for 
which you want whether status and forecasts. Each app will let you know what 
it uses. It is your choice whether you Allow or Deny access.
This is similar to the license agreements you sign when installing software on 
your PC. Hopefully, you read them all in detail and understand all the implica-
tions. In practice, you hope that it’s not a problem if lots of other people have 
accepted these conditions. In the case of a well-known app like Facebook, 
you’re probably safe, but you should be careful with less-popular apps.
After the app downloads and installs, you will come back to a screen like the 
one in Figure 8-7.
5.	 Tap the dark green Open button.
This brings up the Home screen for Facebook, as shown in Figure 8-8.
If you have a Facebook account already, go ahead and enter your information. 
Things will look very familiar. If you don’t have a Facebook account, and you 
want to add one now, go on to the next section.
FIGURE 8-7:

136     PART 3  Live on the Internet: Going Mobile
In any case, the Facebook icon appears on your Apps screen along with some 
other recently added apps, such as Angry Birds and Solitaire. This is seen in 
Figure 8-9.
If you want this app to be on your Home screen, press and hold the icon. The 
Facebook icon appears on your Home screen.
Creating a Facebook account
If you don’t already have a Facebook account, you can create an account here. 
Toward the bottom of the screen is the option to sign up for Facebook. Tap the 
Sign Up for Facebook link, and you see the screen shown in Figure 8-10.
FIGURE 8-8: 
The Facebook 
login screen.

CHAPTER 8  Playing in Google’s Play Store     137
To sign up for Facebook, you should have the following information:
»
» Name: This would seem to be simple question. However, you should consider 
adding former names and/or nicknames. This all depends upon whether you 
want to be found by old friends or not.
»
» Mobile number: Your mobile telephone number will auto-populate for this 
question. You may want to use another number. Your choice.
»
» Your birthday: Go ahead. Tell the truth on this one.
»
» Your password: Pick one that you can remember.
»
» Your gender: I am not sure why Facebook needs to know this, but pick one 
gender.
After you enter this information, Facebook sends a verification message. If you 
provide an email address, the app sends you an email. If you use your mobile 
phone number, it sends you a text.
FIGURE 8-9: 
The Facebook 
icon on the 
Apps screen.

The email or text contains a code. Enter this code, and your Facebook account is 
validated. To get the most out of Facebook, I recommend checking out Facebook 
For Dummies, 5th Edition (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.) by Carolyn Abram.
Within the Facebook app itself, you see the latest posts from your friends in an 
instant. You get your daily serving of cute kitten images, stories from proud par-
ents about their children, and messages from old flames wondering about what

Providing feedback to an app is an important part of maintaining the strength 
of the Android community. It’s your responsibility to rate apps honestly. (Or you 
can blow it off and just take advantage of the work others have put into the rating 
system. It’s your choice.)

If you want to make your voice heard about an app, here are the steps:
1.	 Open the Play Store.
Refer to Figure 8-2 to see the layout.
2.	 Tap the Menu button (the three parallel lines in the Google Play banner).
Doing so brings up a drop-down menu like the one shown in Figure 8-11.
3.	 Tap the link that says My apps & games.
This tap brings up the screen shown in Figure 8-12, which lists all the apps on 
your phone. Keep on scrolling down. You’ll eventually see them all.
Tapping on one of these apps is how you rate them or uninstall them, as shown 
in Figure 8-13.

If you love the app, rate it highly on a five star scale. To be clear, to rank it as one 
star, tap the leftmost star. To rank it highly with five stars, tap the rightmost star.
Whatever number of stars you pick will bring up a pop-up with those number of 
stars, as shown in Figure 8-14. You can then tell all the world just what you think 
of the app.
While many app developers read the comments, it takes longer for some. I am 
still waiting to hear back from my comments. Please note that seeking bribes to 
provide positive reviews is entirely my idea, and you should probably not copy this 
approach. I will sue if you do.
FIGURE 8-14: 
The Rating 
pop-up.

142     PART 3  Live on the Internet: Going Mobile
On the other hand, if you hate the app, give it one star and blast away. It does not 
happen often, but there are some major league loser apps out there. In most cases, 
it occurs when you have an older phone, and the apps you have assume some 
capabilities that are not there.
This will not happen for a long, long time with the Galaxy S7, but technology does 
march on. Someday in the future, your wonderful phone will be a relic, and some 
new apps will assume that your S7 can be operated through thought control/mind 
reading. Alas, your S7 phone does not have that feature (as far as you know). The 
new app will not seem to work right.
Go ahead and give that app one star and then tap the Uninstall button. Poof.  
It is gone.

T
he Samsung Galaxy S7 should really be called a smartcamera with a phone. 
If you’re like many mobile phone users, you love that you can shoot photo-
graphs and video with your phone.
You probably carry your phone with you practically everywhere you go, so you 
never again have to miss a great photograph because you left your camera at home.
And don’t think that Samsung skimped on the camera on your Galaxy S7. Boast-
ing 16 MP of muscle, this camera is complemented with lots of shooting options. 
Then, you can view your shots on that wicked Super AMOLED screen. Samsung 
also includes a Gallery app for organizing and sharing. Plus, the camera can shoot 
stills and video.
It’s truly amazing to consider the number of options that you have for your pho-
tographs and your videos. Samsung keeps on adding new options, filters, and 
ways to share these files. It would not be surprising if your phone now has more 
capabilities than your digital camera.
These capabilities actually cause a problem. There are so many options that it 
can be overwhelming. Research has shown that people fall into one of three cat-
egories: The first group tends to use the default settings. If they want to alter  
the image, they’d prefer to do it on their own PCs. The second group likes to 
explore some of the capabilities on the phone and will have some fun looking at 
the scenarios, but keep things within reason. The third group goes nuts with all 
the capabilities of the phone.
Chapter 9

146     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
To accommodate everyone, this chapter starts with the basics. I cover how to use 
the camera on your phone, view your pictures, and share them online. This works 
for everybody.
I then focus on the most popular settings for the second group. There are some 
important capabilities.
For the third group, the best that can be done is to lead you in the right direction. 
As much as I would like to, it would be impossible to cover all the options and 
combinations. In my count, there are 2.43 billion possible combinations of filters, 
lighting, and modes. If you were to start now and take a picture every 10 seconds, 
you would not run out of combinations for over 700 years. This would not even 
include all the options for sharing these images.
Realistically, neither you nor your phone will last that long. To keep things in the 
realm of reality, I introduce only the most important and valuable options and go 
from there.
Say Cheese! Taking a Picture  
with Your Phone
Before you can take a picture, you have to open the Camera app. The traditional 
way is to simply access the Camera application from the Application list. Just tap 
the Camera icon to launch the app.
Because the camera is so important, here are a few more ways to get to the Camera 
app. First, press the Home button twice. Boom. There it is.
Next, unless you have turned off the capability for security purposes, there is  
a camera icon on your lock screen. If you swipe the icon across the screen, the 
Camera app bypasses the security setting. You can snap away, but you can’t access 
the photo gallery or any other files.
Here is a suggestion. If you see something suspicious, but are not ready to call 911, 
go ahead and start taking photos of what concerns you. If you need to, you can 
go back to the lock screen and slide the phone icon to the right to call 911, again 
without needing to unlock.
A closely related application on your phone is the Gallery, which is where your 
phone stores your images. The icons for these two apps are shown in the margin.

CHAPTER 9  Sharing Pictures     147
With the Camera app open, you’re ready to take a picture within a second  
or two. The screen becomes your viewfinder. You see a screen like the one shown 
in Figure 9-1.
And how do you snap the picture? Just tap the big Camera icon on the right — the 
camera within the oval. The image in your viewfinder turns into a digital image.
This screen still uses a significant share of battery life, but less than with earlier 
technologies. With Super AMOLED, you even save more power if you use darker 
backgrounds where possible. A few picture-taking options are right there on the 
viewfinder. Going clockwise from the upper-right corner, the options include
»
» Gallery: Tap this icon to take you to see the pictures you have just taken. 
I discuss the Gallery in the section “Managing Your Photo Images,” later in 
this chapter.
»
» Camera/Video camera switch: This icon takes you from the camera to the 
video camera.

» Shutter control: This icon takes the picture.

» Rear facing camera to front-facing camera switch: This icon takes you 
from the 12 megapixel (MP) rear-facing camera to the not-too-shabby 5 MP 
front-facing camera. This is a good option for selfies as you can see what the 
shot will look like before you snap it.
A SUPER-FAST PRIMER ON SUPER AMOLED
All Samsung Galaxy S7 phones have a Super AMOLED screen. Allow me to take a 
moment to explain what makes this so good — and what makes you so smart for having 
bought the Samsung Galaxy S7.
To start, think about a typical LCD screen, like what your TV or PC might have. LCDs are 
great, but they work best indoors where it’s not too bright. LCDs need a backlight (fluo-
rescent, most commonly), and the backlight draws a fair amount of power, although 
much less power than a CRT. When used on a phone, an LCD screen is the largest single 
user of battery life, using more power than the radios or the processor. Also, because of 
the backlight on an LCD screen, these screens display black as kinda washed-out, not a 
true black.
The next step has been to use light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which convert energy to light 
more efficiently. Monochrome LEDs have been used for decades. They are also used in 
the mongo-screens (jumbotrons) in sports arenas. Until recently, getting the colors right 
was a struggle. (Blue was a big problem.) That problem was solved by using organic mate-
rials (organic as in carbon-based, as opposed to being grown with no pesticides) for LEDs.
The first organic LEDs (OLEDs) looked good, drew less power, and offered really dark 
blacks, but still had two problems. Their imaging really stank in bright light, even worse 
than did LCD screens. Also, there was a problem with crosstalk — individual pixels would 
get confused, over time about whether they were on or off. You’d see green or red  
pixels remaining on-screen, even if the area was clearly supposed to be dark. It was  
very distracting.
The solution to the pixels’ confusion is called Active Matrix, which tells the pixels more fre-
quently whether they are to be on or off. When you have Active Matrix technology, you 
have an Active Matrix Organic LED, or AMOLED. The image you get with this technology 
still stinks in bright light, but at least it’s some improvement.
Enter the Super AMOLED technology, made by Samsung. When compared with the first 
AMOLED screens, Super AMOLED screens are 20 percent brighter, use 20 percent less 
power, and cut sunlight reflection by 80 percent. This is really super!

The options are seen in Figure 9-2. I explore the pros and cons of the different

» Flash options: Even if you want to keep it simple, you will want to know how 
to control your flash. Sometimes you need a flash for your photo. Sometimes 
you need a flash for your photo, but it’s not allowed, as when you’re taking 
images of fish in an aquarium, newborns, or some animals. (Remember  
what happened to King Kong?) Regardless of the situation, your phone gives 
you control of the flash. Tap the Settings icon at the top of the viewfinder.  
You have the options of Off, On, or Auto Flash, which lets the light meter 
within the camera decide whether a flash is necessary. The options are  
seen in Figure 9-3.
»
» Self-timer: This lets you set a delay between the instant you tap the shutter

CHAPTER 9  Sharing Pictures     151
You probably know that it’s not a good idea to touch the lens of a camera. At the 
same time, it’s practically impossible to avoid touching the lenses on your Galaxy 
S7. This can create a problem where there can be a buildup of oil and dirt on your 
high-resolution lens. You should clean the lens of your camera from time to time 
with a microfiber cloth to get the most out of your camera. Otherwise, your high-
resolution images might look like you live in a perpetual fog bank.
FOR SKEPTICS ONLY
If you’ve ever used a cameraphone, you might be thinking, “Why make such a big deal 
about this camera’s phone? Cameraphones aren’t worth the megapixels they’re made 
of.” Granted, in the past, many cameraphones weren’t quite as good as a digital camera, 
but Samsung has addressed these issues with the Galaxy S7:
•	 Resolution: The resolution on most cameraphones was lower than what you typi-
cally get on a dedicated digital camera. The Galaxy S7, however, sports a 12 mega-
pixel (MP) camera — and that’s good enough to produce an 8-x-10-inch print that’s 
indistinguishable from what you could produce with an analog camera, and 4 x 
6-inch photos are plenty large for most uses.
•	 Low Light: Many cameraphones perform badly in low light conditions. The Galaxy S7 
has an f/1.7 lens, which will impress the folks who know what that means. The impli-
cation is that the S7 works well in low light.
•	 AutoFocus: We amateurs like it when a camera will do the hard work of focusing. 
The technology in the S7 takes a big leap by having more pixels figuring out where to 
focus.
•	 Photo transfer: With most cameraphones, the photos are hard to move from the 
camera to a computer. With the Samsung Galaxy S7, however (remember: it uses the 
Android operating system), you can quickly and easily send an image, or a bunch of 
images, anywhere you want, easily and wirelessly.
•	 Screen resolution: In practice, many cameraphone users just end up showing their 
pictures to friends right on their phones. Many cameraphone screens, however, 
don’t have very good resolution, which means your images don’t look so hot when 
you want to show them off to your friends. The good news is that the Samsung 
Galaxy S7 has a bright, high-resolution screen. Photos look really good on the Super 
AMOLED screen.
•	 Organization: Most cameraphones don’t offer much in the way of organizational 
tools. Your images are all just there on your phone, without any structure. But the 
Samsung Galaxy S7 has the Gallery application that makes organizing your photos 
easier. It’s also set up to share these photos easily.

152     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
After you take a picture, you have a choice. The image is automatically stored in 
another application: the Gallery. This allows you to keep on snapping away and 
come back to the Gallery when you have time. I cover the Gallery application more 
in the upcoming section “Managing Your Photo Images.”
However, if you want to send that image right away, here’s what you do:
1.	 From the viewfinder screen, tap the Gallery icon.
The viewfinder shows the Gallery icon at the top-right corner of the viewfinder. 
When you tap it, it brings up the Gallery application, as shown in Figure 9-5.
This brings up the current image, along with the some other recent photos.
2.	 Tap the thumbnail of the image you want to share.
It also brings up some options, as seen in Figure 9-6. Right now, you’re 
interested in the Share option.
FIGURE 9-5:

app.

CHAPTER 9  Sharing Pictures     153
3.	 Tap the Share button.
This brings up the options you can use to forward the image; see Figure 9-7 
(although your phone might not support all the options listed here and may 
have a few others not in this image).
•	 Dropbox: This is a cloud storage service. There are many other services 
that give you storage out on the Internet. There is a special folder specifi-
cally for your images.
•	 Messaging: This allows you to send it immediately to someone’s phone as 
a text message.

•	 Bluetooth: Send images to devices, such as a laptop or phone, linked with 
a Bluetooth connection.
•	 Photos: Picasa is a website owned by Google, created to help its subscrib-
ers organize and share photos. The main advantage for subscribers is that 
they can send links to friends or family for them to see a thumbnail of 
images, rather than sending a large number of high-resolution files. Read 
more on Picasa in the next section.
•	 Email: Send the image as an attachment with your primary email account.
•	 Facebook: You can take a picture and post it on your Facebook account 
with this option.
•	 Gmail: If your main email is with Gmail, this option and the Email option 
are the same.
•	 Google+: Google+ is a social networking site that is second in popularity 
only to Facebook. If you signed up for Google+ when you connected your 
phone, you can use this service to host images immediately.
•	 Wi-Fi Direct: Talk about slick! This option turns your phone into a Wi-Fi 
access point so that your Wi-Fi–enabled PC or another smartphone can 
establish a connection with you.
The point is that there is an overabundance of options. If an app on your device 
works with images, this is the place you can upload that image. If one of these 
options doesn’t quite suit your need to share your pictures, perhaps you’re being 
too picky!
Getting a Little Fancier with Your Camera
Using the default Camera settings to snap pics is perfectly fine for those candid, 
casual, on-the-go shots — say, friends in your living room. However, your Sam-
sung Galaxy S7 phone camera can support much more sophisticated shots. Your 
digital SLR camera has a bigger lens than your phone, but I can assure you that 
your phone has a much bigger brain than your camera. I suggest that even the 
users who want these default settings get familiar with the camera’s Mode set-
tings. These are easy to access and will improve the image quality with minimal 
effort.

CHAPTER 9  Sharing Pictures     155
The Mode setting
The Mode setting is where you make some basic settings that describe the situ-
ation under which you will be taking your shot. The default is a single picture in 
Automatic mode. The Mode icon is a round button underneath the button for the 
shutter release.
Tapping on this icon brings up the options shown in Figure 9-8.
FIGURE 9-8: 
The Mode 
options pop-up 
on the camera 
viewfinder.

156     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
Tapping the Mode icon brings up a number of choices:
»
» Auto: Taking a single photo at a time is the default setting, which assumes 
average light. It’s a good place to start.
»
» Pro: This mode gets you to all kinds of camera settings that someone who 
knows what he or she is doing would want to control rather than let the 
camera make the choice. This includes setting the exposure, shutter speed, 
ISO sensitivity, white balance, focal length, and color tone. If you do not know 
what these mean, this is not the mode for you.
»
» Selective focus: This setting lets you get within 20 inches of an object, which 
is too close for the normal autofocus. On top of that, you can change the 
focus after taking the photo. (You read that right!)
»
» Panorama: This setting lets you take a wider shot than you can with a single 
shot. Press the Camera button while you rotate through your desired field of 
view. The application then digitally stitches the individual photos into a single 
wide angle shot.
»
» Video collage: This knits together a series of video images right on your 
phone.
»
» Live broadcast: Use this mode to upload images in real time to Facebook.
»
» Slow motion: This switches you to video mode to slow down really fast shots.
»
» Virtual shot: Put an image in the viewfinder and walk around it. The phone 
figures out where you are and creates a virtual tour. If this does not prove to 
you that your phone is a “smarticle,” nothing will.
»
» Food: This takes pictures that emphasize the colors in food to make your 
friends even more jealous.
»
» Hyperlapse: You can use this setting to create a time-lapse video. The video 
camera will adjust the speed of the shots based upon the movement of the 
phone.
If these are not enough for you, Samsung has some more options. At the top  
of Figure  9-8 is the option to download even more modes. A small sample is  
seen in Figure 9-9. The good news is that you only download the one you want.
Choose the option that sounds right and snap away.

CHAPTER 9  Sharing Pictures     157
Settings options on the viewfinder
Tapping the Settings icon on the viewfinder brings up a number of choices, which 
are shown in Figure 9-10:
»
» Video size (rear): You have the option to get really carried away here. The 
lowest video option is VGA. This is the resolution of your old, analog television. 
That was perfectly adequate for us for many decades, but HD is the minimally 
acceptable resolution for thoroughly modern folks. However, your phone 
scoffs at this puny resolution, and can take it to four higher settings, as seen 
in Figure 9-11. The only reason to hesitate to use these higher settings is that, 
just as with still pictures, videos recorded in higher resolutions take more 
memory. It is good to know these resolutions are there. In addition to higher 
resolution, the FHD (60 fps) steps up quality by taking many more images per 
second. FHD normally uses between 24 and 30 frames per second. Using 60 
frames per second removes any flicker at all. It also uses twice the amount 
of memory.

» Motion photo: This is a neat capability. Selecting this option records a short 
video clip before you take the still photo.
»
» Tracking AF: The Samsung Galaxy S7 can spot a person’s face and assumes 
that you want it to be the place where you focus if you toggle this option to the 
On position. Otherwise, if you don’t use this mode, the camera may assume 
that you want whatever is in the center of the viewfinder to be in focus.

» Video stabilization: If too much caffeine is causing your shots to blur, this 
capability is your answer.
»
» Grid lines: Some people like to have a 3 x 3 grid on the viewfinder to help 
frame the shot. If you are one of these people, toggle on this option.
»
» Location tags: The Samsung Galaxy S7 uses its GPS to tell the location of 
where you took the shot. If this is too intrusive, you can leave out this informa-
tion on the image description.
»
» Shooting methods (rear): This option lets you turn voice control on. Your 
camera is listening to you. If you say, “Smile,” “Cheese,” “Capture,” or “Shoot,” 
the camera will snap a shot. This is simpler than using the self-timer. If you say 
“record video,” the video recorder will start recording. In either case, you can 
tell it to zoom by saying “zoom” — or not if you turn off this option.
»
» Review pictures: Some people want to see the shot right away. Others want 
to take a bunch of pictures and look at them at their leisure. If you want to see 
the image right away to see whether you need to take a second picture, turn 
on this toggle. It will jump you in to the Gallery app right away.
»
» Quick launch: You can launch the camera by pressing the Home button 
twice. If you would rather not, here is where you can disable that setting.
»
» Save as RAW file: This option turns off all the fancy photo-enhancing capabili-
ties and just gives you whatever the cameras sees. This is for the folks who 
want to work with the images on some other PC.
»
» Storage location: If you have installed a microSD card in your phone, it 
will assume you want to use it to store images. If you have a microSD card 
installed but want to save photos in phone memory, here is where you make 
that selection.
»
» Volume keys function: This setting allows, or disables, the increase/decrease 
volume buttons on the side of the phone to control the shutter, the video 
recorder, or the zoom/pan capability when in camera or video mode.
»
» Shutter sound: It can be satisfying to hear the click when you take a picture. If 
you would rather not, turn that sound off here.
»
» Reset settings: If you mess something up, tap Reset settings, and it will take 
you back to the default settings.
»
» Help: If you mess something up but are too stubborn to reset the settings, the 
Help option will help you figure it all out.

A magic wand icon appears on the left side of the viewfinder. (Refer back to  
Figure 9-2 if you don’t believe me.) That’s not just for Harry Potter fans. Tap-
ping that icon brings up a number of effects that you can apply to your image.  
If you tap the arrow, it brings up a long list of choices. Some examples are shown 
in Figure 9-12.
Select the option that looks right and snap away.
The Digital Camcorder in Your Pocket
Your Samsung Galaxy S7 Camera application can also function as a digital 
camcorder.
Starting the camcorder
All you need to do to use your phone as a video recorder is to put your camera into 
Camcorder mode. From the camera viewfinder, you tap the icon that looks like the 
record button of a movie camera in the upper-right corner, and you switch from 
photographer to videographer.
FIGURE 9-12: 
Some 
examples of

CHAPTER 9  Sharing Pictures     161
At this point, recording video automatically starts. You get the notification that 
says “Rec” in red and the timer from when it started.
The recording continues until you either tap the stop button, which is the cir-
cle with the dark square in the center on the right side of the viewfinder (see 
­Figure 9-13), or the pause button, which is the button with the parallel slashes 
in the middle. If you press the stop button, the screen will revert back to the still 
camera.
If you press the pause button while in camcorder mode, the buttons to the right 
morph into the options seen in the small image below it. You can tap the upper  
button to switch back to the camera. Your other option is to tap the button with 
the red dot to begin recording again.
Your phone is not only recording the video; it’s also recording the sound. Be  
careful what you say!
Taking and sharing videos  
with your camcorder
Just as you share photos you take with the camera, you can immediately share a 
video, play it, or delete it by tapping the video viewer. Also, the video is immedi-
ately saved on your camera. It’s stored in the Gallery app or is viewable from your 
Video Player app (see Chapter 12).
You can get fancy with some of the settings for your camcorder, but you won’t 
find nearly as many settings as you have for your camera (fortunately!). Two set-
tings, Video Size and Image Stabilization, are available in Settings from the Menu 
button. In the Mode settings, you have Live Broadcast, Hyperlapse, slow motion, 
and video collage.
FIGURE 9-13:

162     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
You cannot get to the Settings screen from the camcorder viewfinder. You must go 
back to camera mode. From there you tap the Settings icon to get to these options.
Use Image Stabilization unless you like the feeling of being seasick. It’s turned on 
by default.
Managing Your Photo Images
After you take some great pictures, you need to figure out what to do with them. 
Although you can send an image immediately to another site or via email, it will 
likely be the exception.
In most cases, it’s easier to keep on doing what you were doing and go back to the 
Gallery application when you have some time to take a look at the images and then 
decide what to do with them. Your choices include
»
» Store them on your phone within the Gallery app.
»
» Transfer them to your PC to your photo album application by sending them 
with email.
»
» Store them on an Internet site, like Picasa or Flickr.
»
» Print them from your PC.
»
» Email or text them to your friends and family.
»
» Any combination of the preceding choices.
Unlike many regular phones with a built-in camera, the Galaxy S7 makes it easy 
to access these choices. You need to determine the approach you want to take to 
keep your images when you want them to stick around. The rest of this chapter 
goes through your options.
Even though the Camera application and the Gallery application are closely related, 
they are two separate apps. Be sure that you keep straight which application you 
want to use.
The Gallery Home screen (refer to Figure 9-5) shows how the app first sorts the 
images on your phone into folders, depending upon when they originated.

CHAPTER 9  Sharing Pictures     163
All your photos from the Camera app are placed in files sorted by date. The appli-
cation takes a shot at grouping them when a series of pictures or videos are taken 
about the same time.
Using Images on Your Phone
In addition to sharing photos from your camera, your Galaxy S7 phone allows 
you to use a Gallery photo as wallpaper or as a photo for a contact. And if the 
fancy shooting settings in the Camera application aren’t enough, you can wrangle 
minor edits — as in cropping or rotating — when you have an image in the Gal-
lery application.
The first step is to find the image that you want in Gallery. If you want to do 
something to this image other than send it, tap the Edit button at the bottom of 
the screen (refer to Figure 9-6). Some of the options include
»
» Slideshow: This displays each of the images for a few seconds. You can not 
only set the speed for transition, but also add music and select among several 
image transitions.
»
» Crop: Cut away unnecessary or distracting parts of the image. The application 
creates a virtual box around what it considers to be the main object. You can 
move the box around the image, but you cannot resize it. You then can either 
save this cropped image or discard.
»
» Set As: Make this image your wallpaper or set it as the image for a contact.
»
» Print: This option allows you to print if you have set up a local printer to com-
municate with your phone either through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
»
» Rename: These options allow you to rotate the image right or left. This is 
useful if you turned the camera sideways to get more height in your shot and 
now want to turn the image to landscape (or vice versa).
»
» Details: See the information on the image — its metadata, which is fixed and 
cannot change.

164     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
Deleting Images on Your Phone
Not all the images on your phone are keepers. When you want to get rid of an 
image, press and hold the image you want to delete. In a second, a checkbox with 
the image selected will appear. Also, the links appear at the top to either Share or 
Delete. If you want to delete this image, tap Delete. The camera verifies that this 
is your intent. After you confirm, the image goes away.
If you want to delete more images, you can tap all the images you want to make go 
away. It is selected if it has a green checkmark on the image. Tap away, then hit 
delete. It will confirm with you once. Tap again and these images are gone forever.
When I say that the photos you delete are gone forever, I do mean for-ev-er. Most 
of us have inadvertently deleted the only copy of an image from a PC or a digital 
camera. That’s not a pleasant feeling, so be careful.

ames are the most popular kind of download for smartphones of all  
kinds. In spite of the focus on business productivity, socializing, and mak-
ing your life simpler, games outpace all other application downloads.  
To this point, the electronic gaming industry has larger revenues than the movie 
industry — and has for several years!
The fact of the matter is that your Samsung Galaxy S7, with its large Super AMO-
LED screen and beefy graphics processing unit, makes Android-based games 
more fun. And because you already have one, maybe you should take a break and 
concentrate on having fun!
The Play Store Games Category
Chapter 8 introduces the Play Store, shown in Figure 10-1. The first level catego-
rization split offerings into two categories: Apps & Games and Entertainment. 
While most of us play games for the purpose of entertainment, the Entertainment 
section involves options that are created for our passive enjoyment.
We want games. Games that test our skills; games that are fun; games that are 
cute; games that immerse us in an alternate universe! To get there, tap on the 
Apps & Games!

166     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
We could have a lively and intellectually stimulating debate on the merits of games 
versus applications. For the purposes of this book, the differences between games 
and apps are as follows:
»
» If a person likes a game, he or she tends to play it for a while, maybe for a few 
weeks or even months, and then stops using it. A person who likes an app 
tends to keep on using it.
»
» Games tend to use more of the graphical capabilities of your phone.

» People who use their phones for games tend to like to try a wide range of 
games.
The Apps & Games section offers tools to help you with fitness, business produc-
tivity, and education. Fie, Bah, Boo, I say! Save that for another time. Now you want 
to have some fun!! Let’s go find some good games for your Samsung Galaxy S7.
The best way to approach this is to find the link in the subcategories that says

You now go to a section of the store that is nothing but games. This section includes 
everything from simple puzzles to simulated violence. All games involve vari-
ous combinations of intellect, skill (either cognitive or motor), and role-playing.  
Let’s do it.
The Games Home screen
When you tap on the Games option shown in Figure 10-2, you go to the Home 
screen for Games. If you scroll down, you see many suggested games. This is 
shown in panorama in Figure 10-3.
If you aren’t sure what games you might like to try, don’t worry: There are lots 
of options. As you can see, the Home screen makes lots of suggestions. Each row 
takes a different perspective on helping you find a new game. A few of these are 
board games, strategy games, and action games. They also include games that 
allow you to play offline without Wi-Fi.
Another approach is to choose the Categories options, seen in Figure 10-2. This 
will bring up the game categories shown in Figure 10-4.
The Games Categories tab
If you scroll to the left from the tab that says Home, you see a tab for Categories. 
These are seen in Figure 10-4.

CHAPTER 10  Playing Games     169
In the Play Store, games are divided into the following genres:
»
» Action: Games that involve shooting projectiles that can range from marsh-
mallows to bullets to antiballistic missiles. They also involve fighting games 
with every level of gore possible.
»
» Adventure: Games that take you to virtual worlds where you search for trea-
sure and/or fight evil. Zombies and vampires are traditional evildoers.
»
» Arcade: Game room and bar favorites.
»
» Board: Versions of familiar (and some not-so-familiar) board games.
»
» Card: All the standard card games are here.
»
» Casino: Simulations of gambling games; no real money changes hands.
»
» Casual: Games that you can easily pick up and put aside (unless you have and 
addictive personality).
»
» Educational: Enjoyable games that also offer users enhanced skills or 
information.
»
» Music: Includes a wide range of games that involve music in one way or 
another. These games may include trivia, educational games involving learn-
ing music, or sing-a-long songs for kids.
»
» Puzzle: Includes games like Sudoku, word search, and Trivial Pursuit.
»
» Racing: Cars, go-karts, snowboards, jet skis, biplanes, jets, or spacecraft 
­competing with one another.
»
» Role Playing: In a virtual world, become a different version of who you are in 
real life, be it for better or worse.
»
» Simulation: Rather than live in the virtual world of some game designer, 
­create and manage your own virtual world.

»
» Sports: Electronic interpretations of real-world activities that incorporate 
some of the skill or strategy elements of the original game; vary based upon 
the level of detail.
»
» Strategy: Emphasize decision-making skills, like chess; a variety of games with 
varying levels of complexity and agreement with reality.
»
» Trivia: A variety of games that reward you if you know things like the name of 
the family dog from the TV show My Three Sons. Its name was Tramp, but you 
knew that already.
»
» Word: Games that are universally popular, such as Scrabble.
Many games appear in more than one category.
Each game has a Description page. It’s similar to the Description page for apps, 
but it emphasizes different attributes. Figure 10-5 is an example Description page.
When you’re in a category that looks promising, look for these road signs to help 
you check out and narrow your choices among similar titles:
»
» Ratings/Comments: Gamers love to exalt good games and bash bad ones. 
The comments for the game shown in Figure 10-5 are complimentary, and the 
overall ranking next to the game name at the top suggests that many others 
are favorable.
»
» Description: This tells you the basic idea behind the game.

» What’s New: This section tells what capabilities have been added since the 
previous release. This is relevant if you have an earlier version of this game.
»
» Reviews: Here is where existing users get to vent their spleen if they do not 
like the game or brag about how smart they are for buying it ahead of you. 
The comments are anonymous, include the date the comment was left, and 
tell you the kind of device the commenter used. There can be applications 
that lag on some older devices. However, you have the Galaxy S7, which has 
the best of everything (for now).
»
» More Games by Developer: If you have a positive experience with a given 
game, you may want to check that developer’s other games. The More By 
­section makes it easier for you to find these other titles.
»
» Users Also Viewed/Users Also Installed: This shows you the other apps that 
other people who downloaded this app have viewed or downloaded. These 
are some apps that you may want to check out.
»
» Price: As a tie-breaker among similar titles, a slightly higher price is a final 
indication of a superior game. And because you’re only talking a few pennies, 
price isn’t usually a big deal.
Leaving Feedback on Games
For applications in general, and games in particular, the Play Store is a free mar-
ket. When you come in to the Play Store, your best path to finding a good purchase 
is to read the reviews of those who have gone before you. Although more than a 
million users have commented on Angry Birds, most games do not have that kind 
of following.
One could argue that your opinion would not move the overall rating for a fre-
quently reviewed game like Angry Birds. The same cannot be said for other games.
One of the new paid games is Dungeoneers from Monsterious Games. The game 
description is seen in Figure 10-6.
A Description page, before you download it to your phone, will show either the 
Install button or the price of the game; the feedback areas will be grayed out. The 
Description page after you download the game to your phone will offer the options 
to Open or Uninstall, and the feedback areas will be active.
In this case, Dungeoneers has been reviewed by 21 gamers, most of whom are 
pretty darn enthusiastic. Your opinion matters more for this game than for the 
heavily reviewed games. After you’ve downloaded and played a game, you can 
help make the system work by providing your own review. This section reviews

H
aving a map on your phone is a very handy tool. At the most basic level, 
you can ask your phone to show you a map for where you plan to go. This 
is convenient, but only a small part of what you can do.
With the right applications, your Galaxy S7 phone can do the following:
»
» Automatically find your location on a map
»
» Give directions to where you want to go
•	 As you drive, using historical driving times
•	 As you drive, using real-time road conditions
•	 While you walk
•	 As you take public transportation
»
» Give turn-by-turn directions as you travel
•	 With two-dimensional representations of the road and intersections
•	 With three-dimensional representations of the roads, buildings, and 
intersections

»
» Tell others where you are
»
» Use the screen on your phone as a viewfinder to identify landmarks as you 
pan the area (augmented reality)
There are also some mapping applications for the Galaxy S7 for commercial users, 
such as MyBusVue from Zonar Systems or Live Truck Tracking from Real Green 
Systems, but I don’t cover them in this book.
GPS 101: First Things First
You can’t talk smartphone mapping without GPS in the background, which cre-
ates a few inherent challenges of which you need to be aware. First off (and obvi-
ously), there is a GPS receiver in your phone. That means the following:
»
» Gimme a sec. Like all GPS receivers, your location-detection system takes a 
little time to determine your location when you first turn on your phone.
»
» Outdoors is better. Many common places where you use your phone —  
primarily, within buildings — have poor GPS coverage.
»
» Nothing is perfect. Even with good GPS coverage, location and mapping 
aren’t perfected yet. Augmented reality, the option that identifies local land-
marks on the screen, is even less perfect.
»
» You must be putting me on. Your GPS receiver must be turned on for it to 
work. Sure, turning it off saves battery life, but doing so precludes mapping 
applications from working.
»
» Keep it on the down-low. Sharing sensitive location information is of grave 
concern to privacy advocates. The fear is that a stalker or other villain can 
access your location information in your phone to track your movements. In 
practice, there are easier ways to accomplish this goal, but controlling who 
knows your location is still something you should consider, particularly when 
you have applications that share your location information.
Good cellular coverage has nothing to do with GPS coverage. The GPS receiver 
in your phone is looking for satellites; cellular coverage is based upon antennas 
mounted on towers or tall buildings.
Mapping apps are useful, but they also use more battery life and data than many 
other applications. Be aware of the impact on your data usage and battery life. 
Leaving mapping applications active is convenient, but it can also be a drain on 
your battery and your wallet if you don’t pay attention to your usage and have the 
wrong service plan.

CHAPTER 11  Mapping Out Where You Want to Be     179
Practically Speaking: Using Maps
The kind of mapping application that’s easiest to understand is one that pres-
ents a local map when you open the application. Depending on the model of your 
phone, you may have a mapping applications preloaded, such as Google Maps, 
TeleNav, or VZ Navigator. You can find them on your Home screen and in your 
Application list.
It’s not a large leap for a smartphone to offer directions from your GPS-derived 
location to somewhere you want to go in the local area. These are standard capa-
bilities found in each of these applications.
This section describes Google Maps and Google Maps Navigation; these are both 
free and may come preinstalled on your phone. If not, you can download them 
from the Google Play Store. Other mapping applications that may come with your 
phone, such as Bing Maps or TeleNav, have similar capabilities, but the details 
will be a bit different. Or you may want to use other mapping applications. That’s 
all fine.
In addition to the general-purpose mapping applications that come on your 
phone, hundreds of available mapping applications can help you find a favorite 
store, navigate waterways, or find your car in a crowded parking lot. For exam-
ple, Navigon and Waze offer solutions that base their navigation on real-time 
traffic conditions and give you turn-by-turn directions using three-dimensional 
images of the neighborhoods in which you are driving. For more, see the section, 
“Upgrading Your Navigation,” at the end of this chapter.
As nice as mapping devices are, they’re too slow to tell you to stop looking at 
them and avoid an oncoming car. If you can’t control yourself in the car and need 
to watch the arrow on the map screen move, do yourself a favor and let someone 
else drive. If no one else is available to drive, be safe and don’t use the navigation 
service on your phone in the car.
The most basic way to use a map is to bring up the Google Maps application. The 
icon for launching this app is shown here.
The first screen that you see when you tap the Google Maps icon is a street map 
with your location. Figure 11-1 shows an example of a map when the phone user 
is in the Seattle area.
The location of the user is a blue arrow head at the center of the map. The res-
olution of the map in the figure starts at about one square mile. You can see  
other parts of the map by placing a finger on the map and dragging away from the 
part of the map that you want to see. That brings new sections of the map onto 
the screen.

180     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
Turn the phone to change how the map is displayed. Depending on what you’re 
looking for, a different orientation might be easier.
Changing map scale
A resolution of one square mile will work, under some circumstances, to help you 
get oriented in an unfamiliar place. But sometimes it helps to zoom out to get a 
broader perspective or zoom in to find familiar landmarks, like a body of water or 
a major highway.
To get more real estate onto the screen, use the pinch motion I discuss in  
Chapter 2. This shrinks the size of the map and brings in more of the map around 
where you’re pinching. If you need more real estate on the screen, you can keep 
pinching until you get more and more map. After you have your bearings, you can 
return to the original resolution by double-tapping the screen.

On the other hand, a scale of one square mile may not be enough. To see more 
landmarks, use the stretch motion to zoom in. The stretch motion expands the 
boundaries of the place where you start the screen. Continue stretching and 
stretching until you get the detail that you want. Figure 11-2 shows a street map 
both zoomed in and zoomed out. The map on the left is zoomed in in Satellite 
view. The map on the right is zoomed out in Terrain view.
The app gives you the choice of Satellite view or Terrain view by tapping the menu 
button, the three parallel lines, on the top-left corner of the map. This brings up 
a pop-up menu similar to the one shown in Figure 11-3.
Bring up the Satellite view by tapping Satellite. You get the Terrain view by tap-
ping Terrain. You can also bring up other views that are useful to you, including 
transit routes and bicycling paths. I show you some of the other options in the 
next section in this chapter.
If you’re zooming in and can’t find where you are on the map, tap the dot- 
surrounded-by-a-circle icon (refer to Figure 11-1 for the centering icon). It moves 
the map so that you’re in the center.

Finding nearby services
Most searches for services fall into a relatively few categories. Your Maps applica-
tion is set up to find what you’re most likely to seek. By tapping the Local Services 
icon at the bottom of the page (refer to Figure 11-1), you’re offered a quick way to 
find the services near you, such as restaurants, coffee shops, bars, hotels, attrac-
tions, ATMs, and gas stations, as shown in Figure 11-4.
Not only that, it is aware of the time of day. There are different suggestions dur-
ing breakfast time than in the evening. Just scroll down and tap one of the topical 
icons, and your phone performs a search of businesses in your immediate area. 
The results come back as a regular Google search with names, addresses, and dis-
tances from your location. An example is shown in Figure 11-5.
In addition to the location and reviews, the search results include icons and other 
relevant information:
»
» Directions: Tap the car icon to get turn-by-turn directions from your location 
to this business.

mation, such as reviews from other parts of the web.
Just how deeply you dive into using this information is up to you. In any case, hav-
ing this kind of information when you’re visiting an unfamiliar location is handy.
Getting and Using Directions
You probably want to get directions from your map application. I know I do. You 
can get directions in a number of ways, including
»
» Tap the Search text box and enter the name or address of your location — for 
example, Seattle Space Needle or 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield, IL.
FIGURE 11-5:

CHAPTER 11  Mapping Out Where You Want to Be     185
»
» Tap the Services icons (refer to Figure 11-2), tap the Attractions icon (refer to 
Figure 11-4), and select your location.
Any of these methods lead you to the map showing your location, as shown in 
Figure 11-6.
It might seem intuitive to expect that when you search for a specific attraction 
(such as the Seattle Space Needle), you get only the Seattle Space Needle. Such 
a result, however, is sometimes too simple. If a given search may have multiple 
results, such as for chain stores. Google Map gives you several choices, and you 
may need to choose your favorite. Typically, the app will give you the closest option.
To get directions, tap the Directions icon. This brings up the pop-up screen shown 
in Figure 11-7.

This gives you the options of
»
» Driving: Turn-by-turn directions as you drive from where you are to the

» Public Transportation: This option tells you how to get to your destination by 
taking public transportation using published schedules.
»
» Cycling: This option is for the cyclists among us; it includes bike trails in addi-
tion to city streets.
»
» Walking Navigation: Turn-by-turn directions as you walk to your destination.
For each of these options, you can use the options at the bottom of the screen to

Upgrading Your Navigation
As a rule, free navigation applications like Google Maps Navigation use histori-
cal averages to determine travel times. The applications that charge a modest 
monthly fee (between $5 and $10 monthly), like VZ Navigator, have real-time 
updates that avoid taking you on congested routes. They also tend to have 3D 
images that provide better context for landmarks. (See Figure 11-9.)
As you can see in Figure 11-9, the 2D map is perfectly usable and accurate, but the 
3D map gives you context and additional information about the buildings around 
you, which can give you an extra level of confidence. So if you frequently depend 
on your mapping app to get where you’re going, you may find it worth your while 
to spend money for a paid app.
Paying an extra $5 to $10 monthly feels like a lot for some of us. Keep in mind, 
however, that
FIGURE 11-8:

188     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
»
» This amount is relatively modest compared to what you’re paying monthly for 
your service.
»
» The price of a dedicated GPS receiver, with almost exactly the same capabili-
ties, is between $125 and $200. The monthly cost of the service is comparable 
to the one-time fee of the GPS receiver. Plus, you don’t have the hassle of 
lugging an additional device and its wiring.
Sometimes the app gives audio instructions. The Google App has a speaker icon 
that appears on the map that allows you to turn audio instructions on or off.

S
martphones have built-in digital music and video players. Some people hes-
itate to give up on their MP3 or portable multimedia players. This is simply 
technological inertia.
Having a single device that you can use as a phone and as a source of music is 
quite convenient because then you need only one device rather than two, and you 
eliminate extra cords for charging and separate headphones for listening. Your 
Samsung Galaxy S7 is no exception. You can play digital music files and podcasts 
all day and all night on your phone.
In addition, by virtue of the Super AMOLED screen on your Galaxy S7 smartphone, 
your phone makes for an excellent handheld video player. Just listen on the head-
set and watch on the screen, whether you have a short music video or a full-length 
movie.
To boot, your Galaxy S7 comes with applications for downloading and listening to 
music as well as downloading and watching videos. These apps are very straight-
forward, especially if you’ve ever used a CD or a DVD player. I will judge the suc-
cess of this chapter by the number of MP3 and CD players that readers list on eBay.

Being Mindful of Carrier Quirks
The only possible pitfall for playing music and videos on your smartphone is that 
each cellular carrier has its own spin: Some carriers want you to use their propri-
etary music stores; some give you the freedom to enjoy the flexibility that comes 
with owning an Android-based phone. You can use the basic multimedia tools that 
come with the phone or download the myriad options that you have via the Play 
Store. (Read all about the Play Store in Chapter 8.)
To keep things straight, read on to see the options you have regardless of what 
cellular carrier you use — including the use of the basic multimedia applications 
that came with your phone. Lots and lots of options for entertainment exist out 
there. The truth is that there isn’t that much difference among them when it 
comes to playing. The differences lie in price and selection.
Therefore, I cover the basic functions, but I encourage you to find the entertain-
ment that you prefer. Trust me — it’s out there somewhere. Find the music you 
like and subscribe to as many services as it takes to bring you joy. Remember, the 
whole point is enjoyment. Enjoy yourself!
Getting Ready to Be Entertained
Regardless of the model phone you have, the particular app you use for enter-
tainment, and whether you’re listening to audio or watching video, here’s where 
I cover some common considerations up front.
The first is the use of headsets. Yeah, you use headphones with your MP3 player, 
but you probably want to use a headset with your phone. The vocabulary is more 
than just semantics; a headset has headphones plus a microphone on the cable. 
This makes it easier for when you get a call while listening to music or watching 
a movie.
Your phone sees an incoming call and will pause the music or movie and show you 
the caller ID. If you answer it and you have a headset, you can be reasonably assured 
that the person on the other line will hear you loud and clear. If you have head-
phones, the phone will use the built-in microphone for your voice while you hear 
the caller on your headphones. My advice is to test the sound quality using a head-
phone and judge for yourself whether you want to use a headset or headphones.
Next, I explore speakers. I touch on speakers in Chapters 3 when talking about 
Bluetooth pairing and again in Chapter 16 when I talk about making the phone 

CHAPTER 12  Playing Music and Videos     191
your own. As you may guess, having a solid strategy for speakers is important to 
get the most out of your Galaxy S7.
Then you need to know about connecting your Galaxy S7 phone to a television 
and/or stereo. After I talk about that, I cover the issue of licensing multimedia 
material.
Finally, I explore storing all these options on your phone for your offline enjoy-
ment. You can have gobs of storage at your disposal if you want. I explore what the 
term “gobs” really means in terms of audio and video storage.
Choosing your headset
You can use wired or wireless (Bluetooth) headsets with your Samsung Galaxy S7 
phone. Wired headsets are less expensive than Bluetooth headsets, and, of course, 
wired headsets don’t need charging, as do the Bluetooth headsets.
On the other hand, you lose freedom of mobility if you’re tangled up in wires. In 
addition, the battery in Bluetooth headsets lasts much longer than the battery in 
your phone.
Wired headsets
At the bottom of your Galaxy S7 phone is a headset jack. If you try to use your 
regular headphone jack in this jack, you’ll hear the audio, but the person on the 
other end of the call may not hear you because the headphones don’t come with a 
microphone. In such a case, your phone tries to use the built-in mic as a speaker-
phone. Depending upon the ambient noise conditions, it may work fine or sound 
awful. Of course, you can always ask the person you’re talking to whether he or 
she can hear you.
To address that problem, your phone might come with a wired headset. In that 
case, just plug it in to use the device. The Galaxy S7 uses ear buds, like those 
shown in Figure 12-1.
Some people dislike ear buds. You can obtain other styles at a number of retail 
franchises that offer options, including
»
» Around-the-ear headphones that place the speakers on the ear and are held 
in place with a clip
»
» A behind-the-neck band that holds around-the-ear headphones in place
»
» An over-the-head band that places the headphones on the ear

192     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
The laws in some regions prohibit the use of headphones while driving. Correcting 
the officer and explaining that these are really “headsets” and not “headphones” 
won’t help your case if you’re pulled over. Even if not explicitly illegal in an area, 
it’s still a bad idea to play music in both ears at a volume that inhibits your ability 
to hear warnings while driving.
Ear buds can have a greater chance of causing ear damage if the volume is too 
loud than other options. The close proximity to your eardrum is the culprit. There 
are probably warnings on the ear bud instructions, but I wanted to amplify this 
information (<har har>).
In any case, give yourself some time to get used to any new headset. There is often 
an adjustment period while you get used to having a foreign object in or around 
your ear.
Stereo Bluetooth headsets
The other option is to use a stereo Bluetooth headset. Figure 12-2 shows a few 
options.
You need to consider a few important options before you put down your money 
and buy one. First, you have a choice of the earpieces being “on” the ear, “over” 
the ear, or “in” the ear.
FIGURE 12-1: 
A typical wired 
headset with 
ear buds and a 
3.5mm plug.

CHAPTER 12  Playing Music and Videos     193
The over-the-ear option tends to eliminate outside noise a little better because 
your ears are surrounded by the cushions. This can also get hot if you wear your 
headphones for an extended time. Figure  12-2 shows the Plantronics Backbeat 
Pro. This headset has the added capability of connecting to two Bluetooth devices 
at the same time. It has the smarts to jump between these devices. For example, 
I may be watching a course delivered on my laptop. When a call comes in on my 
cellphone, this headset will pause the video and allow me to take the call. How 
slick is that?
The on-the-ear headphone is good for when you have your headphones on for a 
long time. The on-the-ear headphone seen in Figure 12-2 is a Bedphone that is 
designed specifically for use in bed, including as you sleep. How cool is that?
The third option for headsets includes those that insert into your ear canal. These 
ear buds are just wires and plugs and have some structure to stay on your head. 
Having this kind of headset in your ear makes it less likely to shift or fall out than 
the other options. The in-the-ear headset shown in Figure 12-2 is well-suited 
for those who want to listen to music and have the ability to take calls has they 
exercise. How neat is that?
In each of these cases, a stereo Bluetooth headset is paired the same way as any 
other Bluetooth headset. (Read how to do this in Chapter 3.) When your Galaxy S7 
phone and the headset connect, the phone recognizes that the headset operates in 
stereo when you’re listening to music or videos.
Choosing your Bluetooth speaker
In the last few years, developers released a flurry of products known as Bluetooth 
speakers. Among the better-known Bluetooth speakers are products, such as the 
Dre Beats Pill. These speakers include a range of options, some of which are a very 
small and convenient. Others are designed to offer excellent audio quality.

194     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
Although these speakers (which come in a range of sizes) are not as portable as 
the Bluetooth headset — they’re a little difficult to use as you’re walking down 
the street — they’re usually pretty easy to take with you and set up when you’re 
at a desk or in someone’s living room. They also do not need a cable to make a 
connection and are always ready to go.
Soen Audio’s Transit (see Figure 12-3) is an excellent example of a high-quality 
Bluetooth speaker. Its list price is close to $200.
If you like high-quality sound, this is the quality of Bluetooth speaker that you’d 
want to get. On the other hand, if you’re just looking for background enjoyment, 
you can get a Bluetooth speaker for less than half that price.
Connecting to your stereo
Although being able to listen to your music on the move is convenient, it’s also 
nice to be able to listen to your music collection on your home or car stereo. Your 
Galaxy S7 phone presents your stereo with a nearly perfect version of what went 
in. The sound quality that comes out is limited only by the quality of your stereo.
In addition, you can play the music files and playlists stored on your phone, which 
can be more convenient than playing CDs. If your stereo receiver is older, setup 
involves plugging the 3.5mm jack from the cable shown in Figure 12-4 into the 
3.5mm jack available on newer stereos.

CHAPTER 12  Playing Music and Videos     195
When you play the music as you do through a headset, it will play through your 
stereo. Although each stereo system is unique, the correct setting for the selector 
knob is AUX.
Newer stereo receivers recognize that cellular phones are a great place to access 
music. These receivers support a Bluetooth connection to your phone. If you 
are in the market for a new receiver, make sure that you get one with Bluetooth 
­capability. In either case, you will be entertained. Enjoy yourself.
Licensing Your Multimedia Files
It’s really quite simple: You need to pay the artist if you’re going to listen to music 
or watch video with integrity. Many low-cost options are suitable for any budget. 
Depending upon how much you plan to listen to music or podcasts, or watch vid-
eos, you can figure out what’s the best deal.
Stealing music or videos is uncool. Although it might be technically possible to 
play pirated music and videos on your phone, it’s stealing. Don’t do it. If your 
financial circumstances do not allow you to afford to pay for your music, I suggest 
you listen to Internet Radio. With just a little work on your part, you can get free 
unlimited music and at least a low monthly fee if you want no advertising.
You can buy or lease music, podcasts, or videos. In most cases, you pay for them 
with a credit card. And depending upon your cellular carrier, you might be allowed 
to pay for them on your monthly cellular bill.
Listening up on licensing
Here are the three primary licensing options available for music files and podcasts:
»
» By the track: Pay for each song individually. Buying a typical song costs 
about 79 cents to $1.29. Podcasts, which are frequently used for speeches or 
lectures, can vary dramatically in price.
»
» By the album: Buying an album isn’t a holdover from the days before digital 
music. Music artists and producers create albums with an organization of 
songs that offer a consistent feeling or mood. Although many music-playing 
applications allow you to assemble your own playlist, an album is created by 
professionals. In addition, buying a full album is often less expensive than on 
a per-song basis. You can get multiple songs for $8 to $12.

196     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
»
» With a monthly pass: The last option for buying audio files is the monthly 
pass. For about $15 per month, you can download as much music as you 
want from the library of the service provider.
If you let your subscription to your monthly pass provider lapse, you won’t be 
able to listen to the music from this library. This music is streamed through the 
Internet and not stored on your phone.
In addition to full access to the music library, some music library providers 
offer special services to introduce you to music that’s similar to what you’ve 
been playing. These services are a very convenient way to learn about new 
music. If you have even a small interest in expanding your music repertoire, 
these services are an easy way to do it.
Whether buying or renting is most economical depends on your listening/viewing 
habits. If you don’t plan to buy much, or you know specifically what you want, you 
may save some money by paying for all your files individually. If you’re not really 
sure what you want, or you like a huge variety of music, paying for monthly access 
might make better sense for you.
Licensing for videos
The two primary licensing options available for videos are
»
» Rental: This option is similar to renting a video from a store. You can view the 
video as many times as you like within 24 hours from the start of the first play. 
In addition, the first play must begin within a defined period, such as a week, 
of your downloading it. Most movies are in the $3 to $5 range.
»
» Purchase: You have a license to view the file as frequently as you want, for as 
long as you want. The purchase cost can be as low as $12, but is more typi-
cally in the $15 range.
At the moment, there are no sources for mainstream Hollywood films that allow 
you to buy a monthly subscription and give you unlimited access to a film library. 
This can change at any time, so watch for announcements.
Using the Full Capacity of Your SD Card
Your Galaxy S7 comes with 32GB of storage. Okay. What does that really mean?
The Android operating system is stored on some of that storage space. Plus, the 
apps that you downloaded are stored here. Then, there are the files that you create 

CHAPTER 12  Playing Music and Videos     197
and use. After it is all said and done, you probably have at least 10GB available  
for the storage of photos, music, and videos. So how much is that, and do you 
need more?
The correct answer is, “Who knows?” That is about as worthless of an answer as 
you will find anywhere in this book. However, I can tell you how to change that 
response to “It doesn’t matter.”
Your phone has a slot in the top where you can add a microSD card, and  
your Android operating system can address up to 200GB of storage. Okay. So how 
much is that?
The easiest way to describe it is by figuring out how many photos, how many 
songs, and how many movies fit into 1GB.
»
» 300 images: You can take about 300 images from the camera on your phone 
at resolution at the default settings.
»
» Ten hours of music: If you buy an album, it will take somewhat less than a 
tenth of a gigabyte. The length of albums was set based upon what could be 
reliably imprinted on a vinyl record. That works out to be about 45 minutes 
and maybe a dozen songs.
»
» About one standard definition (TV-quality) movie: Estimating the size of 
videos can get really variable. TV quality video is a waste of that beautiful 
screen. However, an hour of video that uses every pixel of resolution will take 
about 4GB.
Unfortunately, at this point, you need to do a little bit of math. Say that I want to 
watch every minute of all 529 episodes of The Simpsons. This would take 194 hours 
or about 8 days. All I need to do is buy a 200GB chip for about $80, load it up, and 
put it in my phone. D’oh!
You could binge-watch all the episodes of the series Breaking Bad in high defini-
tion on one SD card. If you want to be able to binge-watch Breaking Bad and The 
Walking Dead, it would need to be stored in standard mode. Sorry.
If you are more into music than videos, you could store over 2,500 music albums on 
that poor microSD Card. The albums could include Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Gershwin 
Songbook and Chicago at Carnegie Hall, each of which is well over three hours.
Keep in mind that these are rough estimates. These calculations assume there are 
minor attempts to reduce the size of these files. That can have a huge impact on 
storage needs. Let’s just say that you can put a combination of images, music, and 
video that will keep you entertained for a very, very long time.

198     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
Enjoying Basic Multimedia Capabilities
Regardless of the version of your Galaxy S7, some basic multimedia capabilities 
are common across the different phones. Figure 12-5 shows the Music and Video 
applications.
Your phone comes with these applications preloaded, and you might have other 
multimedia applications as well, depending upon your carrier.
Grooving with the Play Music app
The Play Music app allows you to play music and audio files. The first step is to 
obtain music and audio files for your phone.
Some ways to acquire music and/or recordings for your phone are
»
» Buy and download tracks from an online music store.
»
» Receive them as attachments via email or text message.
»
» Receive them from another device connected with a Bluetooth link.
»
» Record them on your phone.
Buying from an online music store
The most straightforward method of getting music on your phone is from an 
online music store. You can download a wide variety of music from dozens of 
mainstream online music stores. The Play Store is an option. In addition to apps, 
it has music and video. Other well-known sites include Rhapsody, Amazon Music, 
and last.fm.
In addition, many more specialty or “boutique” stores provide more differentiated 
offerings than you can get from the mass-market stores. For example, MAQAM 
offers Middle Eastern music (www.maqammp3.com).
FIGURE 12-5:

CHAPTER 12  Playing Music and Videos     199
The details for acquiring music among the online stores vary from store to store. 
Ultimately, there are more similarities than differences. As an example of when 
you know what you want, what you really, really want, here’s how to find and 
download the song “Wannabe” by the Spice Girls. I’m using Amazon Music. If you 
don’t have Amazon Music in your Applications list, you would start by loading 
that app on your phone, as I describe how to do in Chapter 8. After entering your 
Amazon sign-in information, you see the Amazon Music Home screen, shown on 
the right in Figure 12-6.
From here, you can search for music by album, song, or music genre. Now to 
search for the song you want:
1.	 Enter the relevant search information in the Amazon Music Search field.
In this case, I’m searching for “Wannabe” by the Spice Girls. The result of the 
search for songs looks like Figure 12-7.

200     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
The search results come up with all kinds of options, including: albums, 
individual tracks, similar songs, karaoke versions, and other songs from the 
same artist. Be ready for these options.
2.	 To purchase the track, tap twice on the price.
The left screen in Figure 12-8 shows the price. When you tap once on the price, 
you get a confirmation message to make sure that you want to buy the 
download; the price is replaced with a Buy Song icon, as shown on the right in 
Figure 12-8. To buy, tap Buy Song.
3.	 Expect to pay.
Unless you’re going to subsist on the free promotional songs, you need to pay. 
In this case, you get the screen shown in Figure 12-9.
The song is now loaded on your phone. When you open the music player, it’s 
ready for you to play anytime you want to party like it’s 1996!

202     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
Receiving music as an attachment
As long as you comply with your license agreement, you can email or text a music 
file as an attachment. Simply send yourself an email from your PC with the desired 
music file. You then open the email or text on your phone and save the file in the 
library of your Music app.
Your phone can play music files that come in any of the following formats:  
FLAC, WAV, Vorbis, MP3, AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, WMA, AMR-NB, AMR-WB, MID, 
AC3, and XMF.
Recording sounds on your phone
No one else might think your kids’ rendition of “Happy Birthday” is anything 
special, but you probably treasure it. In fact, many sound recording apps are avail-
able on your phone.
Some are basic and turn your phone into a basic voice recorder. Others can alter 
your voice. (I do not want to know why.) Others are meant to allow you to sur-
reptitiously record voice conversations. Some can specifically record telephone 
conversations.
Be aware of privacy laws in your area! Some jurisdictions require only one party 
in a conversation to give permission to record a conversation. Other jurisdictions 
require positive consent from all parties. While rare, there have been cases where 
first-time offenders have spent long stints in jail for recording what was perfectly 
legal in another state!
In general, a simple record button creates a sound file when you stop recording. 
The sound quality may not be the best, but what you record can be just as impor-
tant or entertaining as what you buy commercially. Your phone treats all audio 
files the same and all are playable on your Play Music.
Playing downloaded music
To play your music, tap the Play Music app icon (as shown in the margin) to open 
the music playing application.
Okay. Figure 12-10 shows your Home screen after your get through the initial mar-
keting welcome. Sometimes this app can be too enthusiastic in welcoming you.

CHAPTER 12  Playing Music and Videos     203
The first screen that you see sorts your music files into a number of categories. 
You can select the category you want to use by tapping on the link that says play­
list. This brings up a pop-up screen.
The categories include
»
» Playlists: Some digital music stores bundle songs into playlists, such as Top 
Hits from the ’50s. You can also create your own playlists for groups of songs 
that are meaningful to you.
»
» Stations: These are kind of like radio stations that follow a particular format. 
You put in a group name, like Genesis or Van Halen, and Play Music will play 
songs within that genre that may or may not be currently stored on your 
phone. Figure 12-11 shows a more recent example when I searched on Bruno 
Mars. The section later in this chapter on Internet Radio describes this service 
in more detail.
»
» Artists: This category lists all songs from all the albums from a given artist.
FIGURE 12-10: 
Home screen 
for the Play 
Music app.

204     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
»
» Albums: Tapping this category places all your songs into an album with which 
the song is associated. When you tap the album, you see all the songs you’ve 
purchased, whether one song or all the songs from that album.
»
» Songs: This lists all your song files in alphabetic order.
»
» Genres: This category separates music into music genres, such as country and 
western or heavy metal.
These categories are useful when you have a large number of files. To play a song, 
an album, or a genre, open that category and tap the song, playlist, album, artist, 
or genre, and the song will start playing.
Adding songs as ringtones and alarms
Here’s how to add a song as a ringtone or alarm. The first step is to open a contact. 
A generic contact in Edit mode is seen in Figure 12-12. (Refer to Chapter 6 if you 
have any questions about contacts.)
FIGURE 12-11:

Follow these steps:
1.	 Tap the Default Ringtone link.
This will bring up a list of ringtones (shown in Figure 12-13).

A quick scan finds that Ode to Joy is not among the options that come with your 
phone. To use a music file as a ringtone, flick down to the bottom to find the 
Add button.
2.	 Tap Add.
This brings up the option to bring up the Sound Picker App. This app shows all 
the music files on your phone, as shown in Figure 12-14.
3.	 Highlight the song you want and tap OK.
From now on, when you hear this song, you know it will be your friend Ludwig. 
Figure 12-15 show that this is now Ludwig’s ringtone.
Jamming to Internet Radio
If you have not tried Internet Radio, you should definitely consider it. The basic 
idea is that you enter information on your current music favorites, and these ser-
vices play music that is similar. In some stations, a great deal of research with 
complex statistical analysis goes into picking similar songs based upon numeric 
analysis of musical patterns. Other stations wing it.
FIGURE 12-13: 
Basic 
ringtones.

CHAPTER 12  Playing Music and Videos     207
The good news is that you can explore your options. Figure 12-16 shows some 
of the 9,000 Internet Radio apps in the Play Store. Pandora and Slacker Radio 
are two of the best-known services of this type; one or the other may have been 
preinstalled on your phone. (Actually, you may find four or more Internet Radio 
options preinstalled on your phone!)
These apps are a great way to learn about new songs and groups that may appeal 
to you. The service streams music to your phone for you to enjoy. You can buy the 
track if you choose.
Streaming audio files can use a large amount of data over time. This may be no 
problem if you have an unlimited (or even large) data-service plan. Otherwise, 
your “free” Internet Radio service can wind up costing you a lot. You’re best off 
using Wi-Fi.

CHAPTER 12  Playing Music and Videos     209
The selection played by even the best Internet Radio can become repetitive after a 
while if you listen to it enough. If you find yourself bored, do not hesitate to switch 
Internet Radio providers and use the same band for the radio station. This will 
almost always bring up new songs.
Looking at your video options
The Play Music app allows you to play music files. Similarly, you use the Video 
Player app to play video options. The Video Player is in your Application list and 
might even be on your home page. In most ways, playing videos is the same as 
playing audio with some exceptions:
»
» Many people prefer to buy music, but renting is more typical for videos.
»
» Video files are usually, but not always, larger.

210     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
Otherwise, as with music files, you can acquire videos for your phone from an 
online video store — and you need to have an account and pay for the use. In addi-
tion, you can download video files to your phone, and the Video Player will play 
them like a DVD player.
There is a great selection of videos on the Google Play Store and Amazon Music. 
Each of these has great video selections that you can rent or buy. Figure 12-17 
shows the Home screens for the Google Play Store and Amazon Video.
We should not forget Netflix, as seen in Figure 12-18.
Using the three screens
If you have a subscription to Netflix, I hereby grant you permission to watch any 
and all of the Netflix options on your Galaxy S7 (once you sign in and comply with 
all the terms and conditions set forth by Netflix). Once you install the Netflix app 
from the Play Store, sign in with the email and password associated with your 
account, and all the Netflix content is there for you to stream. It is that simple. If 
you don’t believe me, give it a try.

CHAPTER 12  Playing Music and Videos     211
If you take a look at the Netflix home page on the Internet, seen in Figure 12-
19, it shows your options for access to the content to which you subscribe. The 
original term for this was called serving the three screens. Three screens referred 
to in the strategy included your television at home, your PC or laptop, and your 
smartphone.
FIGURE 12-18: 
Getting Netflix 
on your phone.
FIGURE 12-19:

212     PART 4  Entertainment Applications
The idea is that you get one subscription and have access to the same content and, 
importantly, can pick up where you left off. So if you’re watching a video on your 
television, you can pick up where you left off on your smartphone.
Netflix is taking this one step further, as you can see in Figure 12-18, to ensure as 
many of its subscribers as possible have access. If you have a Smart TV that has an 
Internet connection, the chances are that Netflix will run on the TV. If you have an 
old and/or a dumb TV, you can get Netflix through streaming media players, game 
consoles, set-top boxes, or Blu-ray players.
Netflix is not the only organization to do this. Many cable companies offer this 
kind of solution, as do many of the video subscription services.
The mainstream video services compete with having a broad range within their 
libraries that seek to appeal to as many customers as possible. Keep in mind that 
there are specialty video providers that offer curated videos for their subscribers.
For example, TeacherTube is a site dedicated to K-12 education, as seen in  
Figure 12-20. If we continue down this path further, there are a great number of 
options for online education. Many of these sites do not consider themselves to 
be video aggregators, but that’s exactly what happens when they take recorded 
lectures and provide them to students.
The best-known online education service is the University of Phoenix. There are 
dozens more online universities.
Education is just one curated video service. Others exist for videos of Bollywood 
movies, British sitcoms, Portuguese game shows, and many other art forms.
Viewing your own videos
In Chapter 9, I cover how to use the digital camcorder on your phone. You can 
watch any video you’ve shot on your phone. From the Google Play application, 
scroll over to the Personal Video section.
Your phone can show the following video formats: MPEG-4, WMV, AVI/DivX, 
MKV, and FLV.
To play your video, simply tap the name of the file. The app begins showing the 
video in landscape orientation. The controls that pop up when you tap the screen 
are similar to the controls of a DVD player.

The reality of virtual reality
Video games can be immersive, and a good movie can really suck you into its real-
ity. The idea of virtual reality is to take this one step further. The basic idea behind 
virtual reality is to create a simulated world by having you wear a pair of goggles 
and presenting images that change the screen based upon movements of your 
head and body.
We can explore the concept by taking it in steps. At the most basic level, you can 
use your phone with a pair of virtual reality goggles. Samsung is offering virtual 
reality goggles that are designed to work with your Galaxy S7. These are seen in 
Figure 12-21.
What happens is that your field of view is entirely taken up by the screen of your 
Galaxy S7. Imagine the most basic scenario, where the camera on the back of your 
phone shows you what is in front of you. This kind of experience is more or less 
comparable to using a pair of eyeglasses.

When you walk forward, things come closer. When you look down, you see the 
floor. When you turn your head to the right or the left, you see things that were 
not in your range of vision. So far, this is not very interesting.
So let’s take it up a level. Now let’s let your phone and all its processing capacity 
and intelligence tell you what you’re looking at. You turn your head, and you see 
a picture. Presto chango, you see a little pop-up next to the picture that tells you 
that this is a print of Edward Hopper’s The Nighthawks. You look out the window, 
and a pop-up appears with current weather conditions and a forecast for today.
Now you take your virtual reality goggles to the grocery store. As you get your 
cart, a familiar face comes up and starts talking. For the life of you, you cannot 
remember who this person is or how you know him. In just a moment, the face 
recognition system recognizes this person, and a pop-up identifies that this per-
son is your old neighbor Bif Wellington. After chatting, you walk the store aisles 
looking for deals. You get a pop-up letting you know when this grocery is giving 
you a good deal on Honeycrisp apples, or if you can get them cheaper at the other 
store. This capability is called augmented reality.
Let’s take it up another notch. Imagine a world where, instead of seeing a slightly 
modified version of your reality, you are transported to a beach. You can look 
around and see palm trees and jungles behind you.
Why stay earthbound? You are virtually transported to the Mars rover landing site. 
As you look around, it is as if you are there on Mars.
Why stay in the mainstream opinion of what is reality? Now we can all have an 
“Alice through the Looking Glass” experience. You can grow and shrink and see 
all kinds of unusual visions which are limited by your imagination.

CHAPTER 12  Playing Music and Videos     215
The reality of virtual reality is that it is not entirely ready for prime time. There 
are some very, very cool demonstrations that leverage the capabilities of your 
phone. The Samsung offering comes at a great price compared to some of the 
other options out there. For that matter, you may have received the Samsung vir-
tual reality goggles for free for preordering your phone.
This should make your friends who own iPhone technology suitably jealous. What 
needs to happen is further application development to really take us to where this 
technology can go.

ou might fall in love with your Galaxy S7 phone so much that you want to 
ask it out on a date. And speaking of dates, let’s talk about your phone’s 
calendar. The Galaxy S7 phone calendar functions are powerful, and they 
can make your life easier. With just a few taps, you can bring all your electronic 
calendars together to keep your life synchronized.
In this chapter, I show you how to set up the calendar that comes with your phone, 
which might be all you need. The odds are, though, that you have calendars else-
where, such as on your work computer. So I also show you how to combine all your 
calendars with your Galaxy S7 phone. After you read this chapter, you’ll have no 
excuse for missing a meeting. (Or, okay, a date.)
Some calendars use the term appointments for events. They are the same idea. I use 
the term events.
Syncing Calendars
Most likely, you already have at least two electronic calendars scattered in differ-
ent places: a calendar tied to your work computer and a personal calendar. Now 
you have a third one — the one on your Samsung phone that is synced to your 
Gmail account.
Chapter 13

220     PART 5  Productivity Applications
Bringing together all your electronic calendars to one place, though, is one of the 
best things about your phone — as long as you’re a faithful user of your electronic 
calendars, that is. To begin this process, you need to provide authorization to the 
respective places that your calendars are stored in the same way as you authorized 
access to your email accounts and contacts in Chapters 5 and 6. This authorization 
is necessary to respect your privacy.
If your phone doesn’t have a Calendar icon on the Home screen, open the Calendar 
app from your App list. This same app works with the calendar that’s stored on 
your phone and any digital calendars that you add.
When you first open this app, you see a calendar in monthly format, as shown in 
Figure 13-1. I discuss other calendar views in the next section.
FIGURE 13-1: 
The monthly 
calendar 
display.

CHAPTER 13  Using the Calendar     221
When you add an account to your phone, such as your personal or work email 
account, your Facebook account, or Dropbox, you’re asked whether you want to 
sync your calendar. The default setting for syncing is typically every hour.
Unless you get a warning message that alerts you to a communications prob-
lem, your phone now has the latest information on appointments and meeting 
requests. Your phone continues to sync automatically. It does all this syncing in 
the background; you may not even notice that changes are going on.
You could encounter scheduling conflicts if others can create events for you on 
your digital calendar. Be aware of this possibility. It can be annoying (or worse) to 
think you have free time, offer it, and then find that someone else took it.
Setting Calendar Display Preferences
Before you get too far into playing around with your calendar, you’ll want to 
choose how you view it.
If you don’t have a lot of events, using the month calendar shown in Figure 13-1 is 
probably a fine option. On the other hand, if your day is jampacked with personal 
and professional events, the daily or weekly schedules might prove more practi-
cal. Switching views is easy. For example, just tap the Month link at the top of the 
calendar, which in this case displays Apr 2016, to bring up the options. These are 
shown in Figure 13-2.
If you tap Week, you see the weekly display, as shown in Figure 13-3.
YOU MAY ALREADY BE A WINNER!
The calendar on your phone might already be populated with events from your work 
and personal calendars. Don’t be concerned — this is good news!
If you’ve already set up your phone to sync (combine) with your email and your calendar 
(see Chapter 5), your calendars are already synchronizing with your phone.

Or tap the Day button at the top of the calendar to show the daily display, as

To see what events you have upcoming, regardless of the day they’re on, you 
might prefer List view. Tap the List button at the top of the calendar to see a list 
of your activities.
The weekly and daily calendars show only a portion of the day. You can slide the 
screen to see the time slots earlier and later. You can also pinch and stretch to 
seem more or less of the time slots.
There is also an annual calendar, as seen in Figure 13-5. This is so busy that it does 
not allow you to see any appointments. It is primarily useful for setting dates out 
in the future.

Setting Other Display Options
In addition to the default display option, you can set other personal preferences 
for the calendar on your phone. To get to the settings for the calendar, tap the 
More link on the daily, weekly, or monthly calendars and tap Settings. Doing so 
brings up the screen shown in Figure 13-6.
You have the following options:
»
» First day of week: The standard in the United States is that a week is dis-
played from Sunday to Saturday. If you prefer the week to start on Saturday 
or Monday, you can change it here.
»
» Show week numbers: Some people prefer to see the week number on the 
weekly calendar. If you count yourself among those, check this option.

» Hide declined events: When some of us decline an event, we don’t care to 
hear about it again. Others may want to keep a reminder of the declined 
event in case the situation changes (or in case nothing better comes along). 
The default setting is to hide declined events; if you want to see them,  
deselect this box.
»
» 7-day weather forecast: If you look at the monthly calendar shown in 
Figure 13-1, you can see an image on some of the days representing the 
weather forecast. If you like seeing this, you can keep this information. If you 
feel it takes too much real estate on your screen, you can delete it.

» Notification: When an event is approaching, you can have the phone alert 
you with a pop-up, signal a notification on the status line, or do nothing. The 
default is to give you a notification, but you can change that option here.
»
» Set default reminders: It helps some of us to be reminded about an appoint-
ment a few minutes before we are to be somewhere. Others of us find this 
annoying. This setting lets you choose whether you get a reminder or not and 
how far in advance you will be reminded.

» Lock time zone: When you travel to a new time zone, your phone will take 
on the new time zone. Under most circumstances, this is a nice convenience. 
However, it may be confusing to some. If you prefer that the calendar remain 
in your home time zone, check this option.
Creating an Event on the Right Calendar
An important step in using a calendar when mobile is creating an event. It’s even 
more important to make sure that the event ends up on the right calendar. This 
section covers the steps to make this happen.
Creating, editing, and deleting an event
Here’s how to create an event — referred to as (well, yeah) an “event” — on your 
phone. Start from one of the calendar displays shown in Figures 13-1, 13-3, or 
13-4. Tap the bright green circle with the plus (+) sign at the bottom right of the 
calendar. Doing so brings up the pop-up screen shown in Figure 13-7 (without the 
keyboard).
The only required information to get things started is a memorable event name 
and the Start and End times.
You need the following information at hand when making an event:
»
» Calendar: Decide on which calendar you want to keep this event. Figure 13-7 
shows that this event will be stored on the Gmail calendar. This is indicated by 
showing my Gmail account next to the blue dot in the middle of the screen. 
When you tap this selection, the phone presents you with the other calendars 
you’ve synced to your phone; you can store an event on any of them.
»
» Title: Call the event something descriptive so that you can remember what it 
is without having to open it up.
»
» Start and End: The two entry fields for the start and end times. Select the All 
Day toggle if the event is a full-day event.
»
» Notification: This field lets you set how soon before an event your phone  
will alert you that you have an upcoming event. This makes it less likely that 
you’ll be late to an appointment if you set this alert to accommodate your 
travel time.

CHAPTER 13  Using the Calendar     227
»
» Location: This setting ties in to the Google Maps app, allowing you to enter an 
address or a landmark. You can also just enter text. If you want, you can enter 
more details on the meeting by adding:
•	 Repeat: This option is useful for recurring events, such as weekly 
meetings.
•	 Invitees: This allows you to have a group meeting by entering multiple 
contacts.
•	 Notes: Add information that you find useful about that meeting.
•	 Privacy: This is the same idea as the Show Me As option, but for  
non-­Outlook-based calendars.
•	 Time zone: If you and everyone that is invited will be in the same time 
zone, you are set. If you happen to be in another time zone or some of 
the invitees are in other time zones, you can use this option to ensure 
that you are not setting a meeting off business hours, or worse, in the 
middle of the night.
FIGURE 13-7: 
The Create 
Event screen.

228     PART 5  Productivity Applications
After you fill in the obligatory (and any optional) fields and settings, tap the Save 
link at the top of the page. The event is stored in whichever calendar you selected 
when you sync.
After you save an event, you can edit or delete it:
»
» Edit: Open the event by tapping it from within one of the calendar views. This 
brings up the information as entered. Make your changes and tap Save. It’s 
changed when it syncs.
»
» Delete: To delete an event, start by tapping the entry on the screen. Tap 
the green Delete link at the top left. This brings up the pop-up as seen in 
Figure 13-8 to delete the event. Tap Delete. The event is gone.
FIGURE 13-8: 
The Delete 
Event pop-up 
screen.

CHAPTER 13  Using the Calendar     229
You can also create an event by tapping the calendar itself twice. Tapping it twice 
brings up a pop-up (refer to Figure 13-7) where you can enter the event details.
Keeping events separate and private
When you have multiple calendars stored in one place (in this case, your phone), 
you might get confused when you want to add a new event. It can be even more 
confusing when you need to add the real event on one calendar and a placeholder 
on another.
Suppose your boss is a jerk and to retain your sanity, you need to find a new job. 
You send your resume to the arch-rival firm, Plan B, which has offices across 
town. Plan B is interested and wants to interview you at 3 p.m. next Tuesday. All 
good news.
The problem is that your current boss demands that you track your every move 
on the company calendaring system. His draconian management style is to berate 
people if they’re not at their desks doing work when they’re not at a scheduled 
meeting. (By the way, I am not making up this scenario.)
You follow my drift. You don’t want Snidely Whiplash trudging through your cal-
endar, sniffing out your plans to exit stage left, and making life more miser-
able if Plan B doesn’t work out. Instead, you want to put a reasonable-sounding 
placeholder on your work calendar, while putting the real event on your personal 
calendar. You can easily do this from your calendar on your Samsung Galaxy S7. 
When you’re making the event, you simply tell the phone where you want the 
event stored, making sure to keep each event exactly where it belongs.
The process begins with the Create Event screen. You bring this up by tapping  
the + sign in the green circle seen at the bottom-right corner of any of the cal-
endars seen in Figures 13-1, 13-3, or 13-4. The information for the real event is 
shown on the left in Figure 13-9. The fake event is shown on the right. This is the 
one that is saved to your work email. The colored dot by the work address helps 
you be aware that this is a different calendar.
Now, when you look at your calendar on your phone, you see two events at the 
same time. (Check it out in Figure 13-10.) The Galaxy S7 doesn’t mind if you make 
two simultaneous events.
Under the circumstances, this is what you wanted to create. As long as your boss 
doesn’t see your phone, you’re safe — to try to find more fulfilling employment, 
that is.

hen you pick up your Galaxy S7 phone, you’re holding as much com-
puting power as was available in a high-end desktop from a few years  
ago — and a graphics processor that would have made a hard-core 
gamer envious. So it’s not far-fetched to want to do some work with your Microsoft 
Office applications, which are relatively modest users of computing power, on 
your Galaxy S7 while you’re away from your desk. Sure. Why not?
Several mobile apps work on Android phones, including Google Docs/Sheets/
Slides, WPS Office, ThinkFree Mobile, and Polaris Office + PDF from Infraware. All 
of these let you be productive on the road without having to pull out your laptop. 
Depending on what you want to do, you may even be able to leave your heavy 
laptop at home.
Chapter 14

232     PART 5  Productivity Applications
In this chapter, I start with an introduction on the basics, explore the tools on 
your phone, and explain how you can use them to your best advantage. Then 
I walk you through the Polaris Office app to show you some of its capabilities. 
Finally, I fill you in on file sharing so that you can get files on and off your phone 
and out into the world.
Preparing for Using Office Apps
The Galaxy S7 phone actually doesn’t allow you to leave your computer behind 
for good, for a few reasons. The most basic is that the sizes of the screen and the 
keyboard aren’t conducive for writing novels and other similarly long documents. 
What makes the most sense is to use your phone to view Office documents and 
make minor changes. Leave the hard-core creation and modification efforts to a 
full-sized PC.
Before I get too far along, I want to explain the capabilities of this solution and the 
logic behind working with Microsoft Office applications.
Focusing on the Big Four
Microsoft Office applications are the most popular apps for general purpose busi-
ness productivity. Virtually every business uses Microsoft Office or applications 
that can work with Microsoft file formats. As you’re probably well aware, the 
heavy hitters are
»
» Microsoft Word: For creating and editing documents. These files use the .doc 
and .docx suffixes.
»
» Microsoft Excel: For managing spreadsheets, performing numerical analysis, 
and creating charts. These files end in the .xls and .xlsx suffixes.
»
» Microsoft PowerPoint: For creating and viewing presentations. These files 
end in the .ppt and .pptx suffixes.
»
» Adobe Portable Document Format: This is a format originally specified by 
Adobe for sharing documents. Called Portable Document Format, or PDF for 
short, these files end in .pdf. Clearly, it is not from Microsoft nor is it a part of 
the Microsoft Office Suite, but it is widely used by businesses to share docu-
ments that are not intended for revision.

CHAPTER 14  On the Road Again: Taking Your Work with You on Your Phone     233
For everything Microsoft Office, check out Office 2013 For Dummies or Office 2010 For 
Dummies, by Wallace Wang (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
The newest versions of Microsoft Office files are appended with .docx, .xlsx,  
and .pptx. Most of the mobile office apps, including Polaris, can work with the 
older and newer formats. In general, however, more applications work with the 
older versions. You don’t give up much by using the older version, but you do 
gain more compatibility with other people who aren’t as current. Over time, the 
discrepancies become less of an issue as more people update to the newer format.
If you skip this section and don’t have any software on your phone to open Office 
documents, you won’t be able to read any Office documents attached to messages 
you receive on your phone. On the other hand, you may not want to be able to look 
at the documents until you’re in the office.
Accessing the Office files
The next challenge in working with Office files is keeping track of the most recent 
version of whatever file you’re working on. In the most basic scenario, you’re 
working on a Microsoft Office file yourself. If you have a desktop PC, you’re prob-
ably accustomed to transferring files among different machines if you want to 
work on them in different locations, such as home or the office. Here are your 
traditional options:
»
» Removable media: You use a thumb drive or CD-ROM to move the file from 
one PC to another.
»
» Email: You email the file from one PC to another.
»
» Server: You save a copy of your file from the first PC on a server that you can 
access from both the first and second PC. This includes the ubiquitous cloud 
offerings you considered when you were first setting up your phone.
The first option is mostly impractical. Your Galaxy S7 phone doesn’t have a disc 
drive or a USB port for a thumb drive. You can find on the Internet adapters that 
plug into the micro-USB on the phone on one side and offer a female USB port on 
the other side for thumb drives. It can work, but this is a hassle for Office files that 
are changing all the time.
This leaves you with the second two options: using email or using a server. Send-
ing and receiving Microsoft Office files as attachments with text or email mes-
sages is probably old hat by now. You receive the email, download the attachment, 
and work away. When you’re done, you save the file to work on later, or you send 
it back to your PC. I go into more detail about this process later in this chapter in 
the section “Sending an Office file as an attachment.”

234     PART 5  Productivity Applications
The server option calls for a little more explanation. By the way, there are two 
fancy terms for this kind of computing. The first one is cloud storage. Cloud storage 
is a service that is provided, usually for free for basic services, from a number of 
companies. Hopefully, you took my advice in Chapter 1 and have signed up for at 
least one of these services.
There is also an idea called a VPN, or virtual private network. This is fairly common 
in businesses. It’s similar to cloud computing, but the “cloud” in this case is the 
company’s computer system.
Using cloud storage
The issue of file sharing is integral to getting the most out of the Office applica-
tions on your phone. To make it really work, the more Office files you store on the 
server, the better. It will do you little good if the files you want to see and change 
are safely stored on your PC, which you dutifully powered off to save energy.
The principle behind this service is that the server appears to your PC and your 
phone as if it were a drive or memory card directly connected to your machine.  
If you know how to copy files from, say, your PC hard drive to a USB thumb drive, 
you can use a server in the cloud. You might not know which computer is doing 
the processing when you open a file. It could be your phone; it could also be a 
computer on the company network or the server itself. Ultimately, you don’t really 
care as long as it works fast and does what you want.
When you tap a filename that appears on your phone (which is comparable  
to double-clicking a filename on your PC), the file opens, and you can read and 
edit it.
When you’re done reading or editing, the file gets saved, secure and accessible, 
until the next time you want to do something to it. This is the essence of the cloud, 
and your phone can happily participate.
Your wireless carrier may offer this service to you, but it is also available from 
Dropbox, Amazon Cloud Drive, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive.
Using a VPN
The idea behind a VPN is that your phone and the company’s data network set up a 
secret password. They know it’s you because you entered your password. Any evil-
doers who see your information exchanges would see gibberish. Only your phone 
and the company computers know how to unscramble the gibberish.

CHAPTER 14  On the Road Again: Taking Your Work with You on Your Phone     235
As with checking your business email on your phone, make sure that your com-
pany is okay with you accessing files this way. In many cases, it’s okay, but some 
companies have security policies that simply don’t let you (or just anyone) have 
access to every piece of data that the company has ever had while you could be 
sitting in a competitor’s office.
Reading and Editing Files with Your Phone
Several mobile apps for Android phones let you be productive while on the road. 
Here, I take a look at the Polaris Office app to show you some of its capabili-
ties. You can obtain Polaris Office from the Play Store for free if it’s not already 
installed on your phone, as seen in Figure 14-1.

Creating a document
To introduce the process, I show you how to create a document on your phone:
1.	 On your phone, open the App list and tap the Polaris Office icon.
You need to create an account and agree to the End User License Agreement. 
You can also use your Facebook or Google+ accounts. Once you get past these 
hurdles and pass through some marketing pages, the Home screen (shown in 
Figure 14-2) appears.
This is the image that you will see first when you open this app.
2.	 Tap the icon with the plus sign in the red circle.
This is the one with the text balloon that says Create New (Hey, this is a 
Dummies book). The options are presented in Figure 14-3.
FIGURE 14-2:

CHAPTER 14  On the Road Again: Taking Your Work with You on Your Phone     237
3.	 Tap the icon for the file type you wish to create.
The options are
•	 Text: Open a blank sheet for a very simple document.
•	 Slide: Open a blank presentation in PowerPoint format (.ppt).
•	 Sheet: Open a blank spreadsheet in Excel spreadsheet format (.xls).
•	 Word: Open a blank sheet in Word format (.doc) or text if it is a very simple 
document.
Tapping the icon of your choice brings up a screen like that shown in  
Figure 14-4 — a Word document that describes how to use the app.  
The details of editing are described in this document.
4.	 Tap the three parallel lines next to the Word icon in the upper-left corner to 
save the document.
Doing so brings up the options shown in Figure 14-5.

5.	 Tap Save or Save As to save the document.
The first time you save a document, you can tap Save, and it will ask you to 
name it something other than the default name. This is just like on your PC. 
Likewise, once you have named the file, you can tap Save, and it will save. 
However, if you tap Save As after it’s named, it assumes you want to change 
the name.
Also, you can store the document on the Polaris drive or in your phone’s 
memory. The app saves the document on your phone or My Polaris servers in 
the format you selected. Figure 14-6 shows the documents stored on the server.

After a file is saved, it’s safe to send it to your home PC or to another PC. When 
you’re ready to email the document to your PC or to another PC, do the following:
1.	 From the My Polaris Drive, tap the information icon.
Here you see my effort to displace The Great Gatsby as required reading in the 
high schools across the country. Imagine I have done some editing, and now it 
is time to send it to the editor.
2.	 Tap the information icon to the right of the document.
You have several choices from the resulting pop-up screen, as shown in 
Figure 14-7. In this case, we want to share it.
3.	 Tap the Share option.
Four options appear, as seen in Figure 14-8.

4.	 Tap the Attach to Email option.
You now get a complete suite of options currently available on your phone to 
share this file (see Figure 14-9). In this case, tap the email icon (yes, this is the 
second time that you have told the app that you want to use email, but just go 
with it). You see the screen shown in Figure 14-10.
5.	 Type an email address (probably from your Contacts list) in the To  
text box and add a subject and a message if you want.
I am sending this document to Wiley Publishing (wish me luck!).
If you want the document on your PC, simply address it to yourself or use one 
of the other share options.
6.	 Tap Send.
The miracle of wireless communication zips the document off to the intended 
recipient.
The process is the same for Word-, Excel-, and PowerPoint-formatted documents.
The formatting of the document on your phone might not be exactly the same as 
it is when it appears on your PC. In particular, your phone may not have every font 
that is on your PC, so it will substitute one that kind of looks like the correct font. 
Save yourself time and don’t try to format a document on your Galaxy S7 phone.
Managing Office documents with a server
The Polaris server works fine for you as an individual. Often companies want to 
store documents on their servers or on servers that they specify. You can work with 
any server. The names may be a little different and the color schemes changed, 
but the basic concepts are similar whether it is the Polaris server or a server that 
belongs to your company.
FIGURE 14-9:

The easiest way to describe the process is to start from the server’s point of view. 
Suppose that you’re writing the Great American Novel on your PC, but you want 
to put it on your phone so that you can review it and maybe make some minor 
edits. The first thing you do is move the file to your Dropbox server from your PC. 
Figure 14-11 is what this document looks like on your desktop PC.
Here are the steps to view and edit this document on your phone using a popular 
public server that works like many servers within business settings:
1.	 On your PC, save your file to Dropbox.
Dropbox looks like a locally attached hard drive. I have created a folder for  
my 100 percent original work. Doing so brings up the screen shown in 
Figure 14-12.
2.	 Open Dropbox (see Figure 14-13) on your phone and tap the folder that  
contains the desired file.
In this case, it’s the folder titled Great American Novel.
FIGURE 14-10: 
Sample email.

3.	 Tap the folder that represents the folder containing the desired file.
In this case, the document is Great American Novel-II.
The image in Figure 14-14 shows my novel. (I still have some work to do on 
this, but I am off to a good start. Anything in common with work previously 
written by F. Scott Fitzgerald is completely unintentional.)
Now you can write more and edit.
4.	 When you’re done, tap the three lines by the Word icon.
Doing so brings up options, including Save.
5.	 Tap Save.
This saves any changes you’ve made back to the file — which is stored on 
Dropbox.
This process works with any Microsoft Office file format. It works with cloud 
servers other than Dropbox, too. It can work the same way with your VPN at the 
office. The tools are there for you to use.

Discovering why Samsung Pay is the 
coolest pay systems
Setting up your phone for payments
Managing your credit card options
Paying with  
Samsung Pay
S
omeday in the future, you will be able to leave your wallet at home and just 
use your smartphone for all the stuff that you carry with you today. We are 
not there yet, but Samsung has implemented some technology that moves 
us toward that day.
You may reasonably ask why not carrying your wallet is such a big deal. Fair 
enough. The two main reasons are that it is more convenient and more secure. 
Samsung Pay takes us a long way to this ultimate goal. The reality is you will need 
to continue to carry your wallet with credit cards and cash for now.
For now, you’ll need to decide for yourself whether the convenience that Samsung 
Pay does offer is worth the effort associated with setting it up. Samsung has gone 
to great lengths to make transactions more secure than simply using a credit card. 
Like so many of these things, the security is only as good as how the individual 
implements it.
With that awareness, some things about Samsung Pay are exceptionally cool. If 
you like to show off new technology to people, this is a good opportunity. In par-
ticular, you can one-up your smug friends who use Apple Pay with their iPhones. 
That capability alone is worth the price of admission for some of us.
Chapter 15

246     PART 5  Productivity Applications
How Mobile Payment Works
It helps to explain how mobile payments work to see how Samsung Pay helps 
you. The idea is that you walk up to the checkout stand at a retailer. You swipe 
your fingerprint on the Home button, place your phone near the card reader, and 
instantly your transaction is done. The receipt prints, and you take your purchase 
and go on your merry way. The charge shows up on your credit card.
You did not have to sign or enter a PIN. All the security that is needed for this 
transaction came from your fingerprint. All the authorizations were set up when 
you set up the credit card with Samsung Pay.
Really. That’s all there is.
It sounds so simple. The interesting thing is that this capability has been around in 
one form or another for almost 20 years. Back in 1997, Mobil gas stations imple-
mented contactless payment with their Speedpass. Users on the system would tap 
their Speedpass fobs that they would keep on the key ring on the reader installed 
on the gas pump.
Their credit card would be charged for the gas they pumped. Initially, the tap 
was all that it took to pay for the gas. Later, users needed to add their ZIP code to 
enhance security. In spite of Mobil’s best efforts, the system had only moderate 
success. There are a range of reasons, but a major concern was that people were 
already hesitant to even carry yet another thing. It is the inclusion of some new 
technology within smartphones that makes it so much more convenient.
Visa and MasterCard also tried contactless systems with limited success. One of 
their major challenges is that not enough credit card readers support the contact-
less payment system. After years of trying, fewer than 10 percent of all credit card 
readers as recently as 2015 have this capability. Those readers that do support 
contactless payment have the logo shown in Figure 15-1.
The contactless payment approach got a significant boost when Apple introduced 
the Apple Pay system on the iPhone in 2014. Like some other technologies that 
have struggled to find widespread acceptance, the implementation by Apple pro-
duces enough momentum that overcomes any resistance to its widespread use.
Examples include the Apple Macintosh with its use of a mouse, the Apple iPod 
revolutionizing the acceptance of MP3 players, and the Apple iPad creating a revo-
lutionizing a trend for tablets. All of these technologies were pioneered by other 
companies before Apple made them popular.
The Apple Pay system has seen significant success in an area where others have 
struggled. The retailers with the contactless credit card technology have seen a 
huge increase in its use from iPhone customers.

CHAPTER 15  Paying with Samsung Pay     247
With Samsung Pay, however, Samsung has leapfrogged Apple. Samsung Pay 
works similarly to Apple Pay with contactless payment devices. It also works with 
the vast majority of standard credit card readers. Take that, Apple!
While 10 percent of credit card readers in retailers today support contactless pay-
ment, another 85 percent of credit card readers at retailers have readers that can 
read the magnetic stripe on the back of your credit card. Samsung Pay along with 
your Galaxy S7 have the electronics built in to work with the contactless system 
but also the electronics to convince the magnetic stripe readers that you have 
swiped your card!
The technology within your phone that works with the standard credit card read-
ers is called Magnetic Secure Transmission, or MST. When you place your phone 
near the magnetic stripe reader, it sends a very short range signal to the magnetic 
stripe reader on your card that simulates the signals it gets when you physically 
swipe a magnetic stripe reader.
Your imagination could go wild and come up with ways that fiendish people could 
potentially steal this technology. One can never say never, but there are exten-
sive procedures that are put in place to set up this capability to prevent it in most 
instances. The rest of this chapter walks you through those processes.
Probably the biggest drawback in using this technology these days is that too few 
retail clerks know that it will work. They freak out the first time they see it as they 
are probably familiar with contactless payment methods, know that they do not 
have it, and do not know about this slick solution. They will want to ask you more 
about it, which will end up taking more time than if you were paying by writing a 
check and having to provide two forms of identification!
Getting Started with Samsung Pay
The first step in the process is to make sure that you have Samsung Pay on your 
Galaxy S7. As cool as this app is, there are many options to this technology, and 
your carrier may have preferred to not have it preloaded. No problem. Chapter 8 
FIGURE 15-1: 
The contactless 
payment logo.

explains how to download applications from the Play Store. The Samsung Pay logo 
is seen in Figure 15-2.
It is easy to confuse Samsung Pay and Android Pay. These are two different appli-
cations. Android Pay is nice, but it does not have the Magnetic Secure Transmis-
sion capability that allows you to use mobile payments at many more retailers.
The app page description is shown in Figure 15-3. When you tap Install, you get 
the image on the right.

CHAPTER 15  Paying with Samsung Pay     249
The Samsung Pay app works a little different than most other apps. The first time 
you open Samsung Pay, you will be given information on how to use it and be 
asked to put in your credit card information (in a very convenient way, by the way) 
and asked all kinds of permissions and agreements.
Once you have given all this information, Samsung Pay waits patiently at the bot-
tom of your home pages, ready to meet your payment needs with nothing more 
than a quick swipe from the bottom of the screen. Most people would simply not 
use this app if they had to go digging through their screens to find the app. This 
way, you do not have to search to find the app and wait for it to come up.
Figure 15-4 shows the Lock screen with the Samsung Pay launch button sitting at 
the bottom ready to appear with a quick flick.
The launch button is also there on the Home screen, but is not visible when  
running other applications.

250     PART 5  Productivity Applications
Setting Up Samsung Pay
When you open the app, you’re greeted with a series of pages before you get to the 
Home screen seen in Figure 15-4. These pages include marketing introductions 
(which you don’t need because you read this chapter), permissions and agree-
ments (which you should give if you want to move forward), and some pages that 
verify that Samsung Pay can work on your phone.
The app wants to make sure that your phone has the right parts (your Galaxy S7 
does, but that is not the case for every Android phone) and that you are in the 
United States or South Korea.
Being in these countries is important for this app because each country has its 
own set of laws for payment, and Samsung may not have all the arrangements 
in place if you are not in one of these countries. New countries will be added as 
quickly as possible.
Read the agreements. In all likelihood, they are the same kind of agreements that 
exist in the fine print in your existing credit card and every time you sign your 
name to a credit card charge slip that affirms you won’t pull any shenanigans.  
That said, I am your humble author, not your legal advisor, and you should feel 
comfortable with these agreements.
The next part of the initial setup process is to step through how you want to set up 
security. You have two security options when you are making a transaction: using your 
fingerprint or entering a PIN. Figure 15-5 shows the screen that gives you the option.
There are a few scenarios where using a Samsung Pay PIN rather than a fingerprint 
might make sense. In most cases, using your fingerprint is exceptionally conve-
nient. Chapter 17 describes the process for using fingerprints as a security method. 
If you have already set up your phone to use your fingerprint, you see Figure 15-6.
The next step is to enter your credit card information. When you tap the link that 
says Add Card, you will be taken to a screen that lets you take an image of your credit 
card. This is seen in Figure 15-7. The left image is when the screen first comes up 
and the right image is when you have the desired credit card in the viewfinder.
The app then interprets the information on the front of your credit card and popu-
lates as many screens as possible with your credit card information. It will ask you 
to fill out the form seen in Figure 15-8 if it can’t figure out the information on 
your card or the information is on the reverse side of the card.
Not every company that offers credit cards is signed up with Samsung Pay. You 
can check the Samsung website or tap the link in Figure 15-7 to check before you 
proceed. Otherwise, just go ahead and see whether things go through.

CHAPTER 15  Paying with Samsung Pay     253
Tap Next, and Samsung Pay will seek to confirm things with your credit card com-
pany. This does not cost you anything. It just wants to make sure that when you 
do make a charge, everything will flow smoothly. One of the things the company 
will want to verify is that you are authorized to use that credit card. This means 
that either you need to be the primary cardholder or you need to coordinate with 
that person. The screen seen in Figure 15-9 comes up.
There are three credit card verification options. If you tap SMS, it will send a code 
to the primary cardholder’s mobile phone. You then enter the code in the next 
screen and you’re verified.
If you tap email, the bank offering the credit card will send an email to the primary 
cardholder’s email address. Again, you enter the code sent in the next screen.
The last option is that the primary cardholder calls the customer service line at the 
bank and makes the request to connect to Samsung Pay.
Once you are verified, it is possible that your phone will ask you to verify that  
you want to make Samsung Pay your primary app. This is seen in Figure 15-10. 
(Never let it be said that the folks at Google did not try hard to get you to use 
Android Pay.)
FIGURE 15-9:

You’re almost there. The next screen, seen in Figure 15-11, is for you to enter your

CHAPTER 15  Paying with Samsung Pay     255
Keep in mind that scanning your fingerprint and tapping your phone on a credit 
card has the same legal implications as actually signing a credit slip.
Once everything is ready, you get the verification screen seen in Figure 15-12.
Using Samsung Pay
First, pick something to buy at a store. Have a clerk ring it up and tell him you 
will pay with a credit card. Swipe the screen upward. You see the screen seen in 
Figure 15-13.
Run your finger over the Home button, and you see a screen similar to Figure 15-14.
As seen in Figure  15-14, you should either hold your phone against where the 
credit card reader would read the magnetic stripe or where there is the contactless 
payment system logo if it is available.

CHAPTER 15  Paying with Samsung Pay     257
The semicircle above your signature will start counting down, and your phone will 
vibrate to let you know that it is transmitting. You will hear a beep if it all goes 
through. If it fails for some reason, you can try again simply by rescanning your 
fingerprint.
This process works with the vast majority of credit card readers. This does not 
work well, however, with credit card readers where you insert your card into the 
machine and pull it out quickly. This type of reader is mostly used on gasoline 
pumps. Sorry.
Managing Samsung Pay
As long as you pay your credit card bills and keep your credit card account at the 
bank, this app is relatively self-sufficient. Still, you will need to access the app 
settings from time to time. You get there by tapping the Samsung Pay logo in the 
upper-left corner of the payment screen that you see in Figure 15-13. This will 
bring up the screen similar to what you see in Figure 15-15.
FIGURE 15-15:

258     PART 5  Productivity Applications
This is a security screen to keep anyone who doesn’t have your fingerprint (which 
is you and only you) away from the actual settings. Have it read your fingerprint, 
and you get to the page seen in Figure 15-16.
Now this looks like a more typical Home screen of an app. To add a new credit or 
debit card, tap the Add link and go through the process described in the section 
“Setting Up Samsung Pay,” earlier in this chapter.
Adding a second card is easy, and the images will stack up when above each other 
on this page. The quick launch link brings up whatever card is on the top. If you 
want to change to use a different credit card, you can flip through the options.
If you want to delete a credit card, all you have to do is tap on the card image. All 
the information associated with that card will appear in the screen. You also have 
the opportunity to delete it by tapping the menu option.
Enjoy your spending!

Ten (or So) Ways to 
Make Your Phone 
Totally Yours
A
 smartphone is a very personal device. From the moment you take it out of 
the box and strip off the packaging, you begin to make it yours. By the end 
of the first day, even though millions of your type of phone may have been 
sold, there’s no other phone just like yours.
This is the case because of the phone calls you make and because of all the options 
you can set on the phone and all the information you can share over the web. Your 
contacts, music files, downloaded videos, texts, and favorites make your phone a 
unique representation of who you are and what’s important to you.
Even with all this “you” on your phone, this chapter covers ten or so ways to 
further customize your phone beyond what this book covers. Some of these sug-
gestions involve accessories. Others involve settings and configurations. All are 
worth considering.

Using a Bluetooth Speaker
In just a matter of a couple of years, Bluetooth speakers have gone from an inter-
esting (and expensive) option to mainstream. Prices have come down quickly, and 
the variety of designs for the speakers has grown dramatically. In all cases, you 
get the benefit of being able to play your music on your phone without the incon-
venience of having headphones. You also get a speakerphone, although the quality 
of the audio can vary dramatically from Bluetooth speaker to Bluetooth speaker.
This accessory is best purchased in a brick-and-mortar store where you can listen 
to a variety of choices. Although syncing with a number of speaker choices can 
be tedious, it’s the only way you’ll know if a particular Bluetooth speaker meets 
your needs.
Although sound quality is essential, the folks in the industrial-design department 
have been having a lot of fun coming up with ways for the Bluetooth speaker to 
look. Figure 16-1 shows a range of options for the most popular form factors.
The most popular options are basically a rectangle, the can style, and the sound 
bar. Each company has its own twist, but these options represent what you can see 
in the high-volume stores.
Fortunately, you live in a world where designers can get creative. Figure  16-2 
shows some of the more exceptional designs.

CHAPTER 16  Ten (or So) Ways to Make Your Phone Totally Yours     263
The House of Marley, for example, uses unconventional design and recycled 
material to stand out in the market. CRAZY BABY makes the Mars series, which 
includes a levitating speaker. SPI Home produces a Bluetooth speaker built into a 
variety of garden statues, including a pelican.
There is no shortage of imagination when it comes to Bluetooth. Be sure to con-
sider all your options. Before you settle on the mainstream options at the local 
mall, do some research off the beaten path. You’ll be amazed at the range of 
options.
Cruising in the Car
You may have gotten the idea that I am concerned about your safety when you’re 
using your phone. True, but I’m also concerned with my safety when you’re using 
your phone. I would like you to have a Bluetooth speaker in your car when driving 
in my neighborhood, if you please.
Some cars have a built-in Bluetooth system within the car stereo that connects to 
a microphone somewhere on the dash as well as to your car speakers. It’s smart 
enough to sense an incoming call and mutes your music in response.
If you don’t have such a setup, there are lots of good options for car speakers. 
Figure 16-3 shows an example.
A closely related accessory is a car mount. A car mount will hold your phone in a 
place you can easily observe as you drive. The mount attaches to an air vent, the 
dashboard, or the windshield.
You could always put your phone on the seat next to you, but that’s for amateurs. 
Instead, offer your phone a place of honor with a car docking station. It makes 
accessing your phone while you drive safer and easier. Some see getting a car 
mount as a luxury, but my view is that if you need to upgrade your navigation 
software, you need a vehicle mount.
FIGURE 16-3: 
Bluetooth car 
speaker.

264     PART 6  The Part of Tens
Be sure to put away the docking station when you park. Even an empty docking 
station is a lure for a thief.
Figure 16-4 shows the Samsung Vehicle Navigation Mount. It costs about $100, 
and you can get it at your carrier’s store, RadioShack, Best Buy, or online at  
Amazon.com. It includes a wireless charging pad.
More economical vehicle mounts are available that do not include a wireless charg-
ing pad. Figure 16-5 shows an example from SlipGrip that costs closer to $30.
This version is special because it is specifically designed to work with larger pro-
tective cases. It can be a hassle to have to remove the protective case from your 
phone to insert it in a vehicle mount. In addition to a car mount, SlipGrip also 
offers a mount for your bicycle.

CHAPTER 16  Ten (or So) Ways to Make Your Phone Totally Yours     265
When shopping for a car mount or a bike mount, be sure to consider the extra 
girth associated with a case. If you don’t use a case (which is a mistake), you just 
need to be sure that the mount is compatible with a Galaxy S7. If you have a case 
on your phone (which is anything but a mistake), be sure the mount will work 
with the Galaxy S7 and the case.
Considering Wireless Charging Mats
Those industrial designers have certainly gone crazy with Bluetooth speakers. 
They have also been having a field day on wireless charging options. For example, 
the Samsung Vehicle Navigation Mount seen in Figure 16-4 has a built-in charger.
Most wireless charging mats are designed with the idea that you can place your 
phone on the mat, and technology will do the rest. You can get a standard Sam-
sung wireless charging pad, shown in Figure 16-6, for about $50. Samsung also 
offers the Fast Charging pad, which will charge your phone from stone-cold dead 
to 100 percent in just a few hours. This capability costs a little more, closer to $70.
If these are too conventional for you, more options are out there as well. Figure 16-7 
shows some of the more interesting options. You can go colorful, high-tech, or back 
to nature. Your choice.
Look for more options going forward!

Your Phone Is Watching You
One of the biggest drains on your battery is the backlight on your screen. Older, 
dumber smartphones have a preset time when they automatically shut off. On 
those phones, you need to push a button to bring the screen back to life.
You, on the other hand, had the foresight and wisdom to buy a Samsung Galaxy S7 
that has Smart Stay. If the front-facing camera recognizes your pretty/handsome 
face, it keeps the light on as long as you are looking at the screen.
To turn this option on, go to Settings and open up the Display and Wallpaper  
settings. Turn Smart Stay on, and you are ready to rock and roll.
Making a Statement with Wraps
The Samsung Galaxy S7 is attractive, but if you want to spruce it up even more, 
you can get a wrapping — for example, from Skinit at www.skinit.com. These 
designs can express more of what is important to you. As a side benefit, they can 
protect your phone from minor scratches.
Figure  16-8 shows some design options for a skin. It comes with cut-outs for 
speakers, plugs, microphones, and cameras specifically for the Galaxy S7.  
Putting the skin on is similar to putting on a decal, although it has a little give in 
the material to make positioning easier. The skin material and adhesive are super 
high-tech and have enough give to allow klutzes like me (who struggle with plac-
ing regular decals) to fit the nooks and crannies of the phone like an expert.
If you’re not crazy about Skinit’s designs, you can make your own with images of 
your own choosing. Just be sure that you have the rights to use the images!

The pictures from your Gallery and the Wallpaper Gallery are images that you can 
set by pressing and holding the Home screen. In a moment, you see icons appear. 
Select Wallpapers and pick the image you want.
The themes take it to a different level. In addition to the background, the phone 
will change the fonts and many of the basic icons. You see the default theme in 
Figure 16-10.
A few samples also come on your phone. You may be a pink kind of person or a

Empowering Power Savings
Imagine that you’re flying on a short hop from Smallville to Littleton. You are 
about to take off when air traffic control tells the pilot that the plane needs to wait 
on the tarmac. Unfortunately, you are low on battery. The pilot says that it is okay 
to use your mobile phone.
Because you do not know how long this will take, you pull out your phone, go to 
Settings, and tap Battery. From here, you put it in Power Savings Mode. This slows 
down a lot of cool features. For example, it dims the screen, slows the processors

CHAPTER 16  Ten (or So) Ways to Make Your Phone Totally Yours     269
and mobile data speeds, and kills the vibration mode. This extends the battery life 
with minor sacrifices to what you can do with your phone. The apps all run, but 
perhaps not as fast.
Then the pilot says that your plane has a flat tire, the maintenance crew went 
home, and you could be sitting there for hours.
This time you open Settings, tap Battery, and put your phone in Ultra Power Sav-
ings Mode. Your beautiful, powerful smartphone has instantly turned itself into 
a dumb feature phone. You won’t be able to watch a full-length feature film. 
However, you now have enough battery to make and take phone calls and text 
messages for hours. This is not an exact science and your mileage may vary, but 
switching to this mode can multiply the time your smartphone can operate as a 
phone by eight to ten times.
Setting Do Not Disturb Options
Mobile phones are great. They allow you to be available all the time.
Mobile phones stink. They require you to be available all the time. I never get any 
downtime.
If you’re a member of the second school of thought, your Galaxy S7 has a solu-
tion for you. You can go to Settings, select Sounds and Vibrations, and tap Do Not 
Disturb. This turns off the ringer and all notifications until you turn notifications 
back on. You are in total control.
But what if you are sometimes forgetful and neglect to turn the phone back on? 
No need to worry. You have a number of options that you can easily program into 
your phone.
First, you can set a schedule when to set it for Do Not Disturb. You could set it 
so that it will not bother you during sleeping hours. Figure 16-11 shows the set 
schedule so that this phone will not be disturbed from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. seven days 
a week. The phone will not make a peep at night.
Hold on. What if I use my phone as my alarm clock? No problem. Tap the link to 
Allow exceptions. That takes you to the page shown in Figure 16-12.

You have the choice to allow alarms. Toggle that option on, and you will get  
your wakeup alarm. Of course, if you toggle on all the exceptions as shown in 
Figure 16-11, you defeat the whole purpose of the Do Not Disturb capability. If you 
limit your Favorites to a few people, such as close family members, you can let in 
their calls and keep out any solicitors that have guessed your number. That sounds 
like a great plan.

Wearing Wearables
Wearables are a class of mobile accessories that have been getting a lot of atten-
tion lately. For the most part, wearables are connected via Bluetooth and typically 
worn as a watch, although you can wear some sensors in athletic shoes. Samsung 
offers its wearables under the brand name Gear (see Figure 16-13).
In addition to telling the time, these wearables give you notifications, weather, 
and texts and track some relevant information, such as the amount of exercise 
you’ve done.
Daydreaming While You Work
Readers of a certain age will remember the CRT screens that would have a problem 
with burn-in. If a screen displayed the same image too long, the phosphor would 
never fully turn off, showing you a ghost image. This was a particular problem 
with the first ATMs. The solution was screensavers that would usually show some 
image moving around the screen.
Screen burn-in is less of an issue with modern LCD screens, but people still like 
screensavers. Besides, burn-in is not an issue with your phone because the screen 
will shut off. Shutting off the screen saves battery life and gives you an opportu-
nity to require a security code to be entered.
Saving power is good when you’re running on the battery, but it’s less of an issue 
if you are recharging the battery and plan to be connected for a lengthy time. 
Under these circumstances, you can have an old school screensaver by putting 
your phone into Daydream mode.
FIGURE 16-13:

272     PART 6  The Part of Tens
You enable Daydream mode by going to Settings, selecting the Display and Wall-
paper option, and turning Daydream to the On setting. This will bring up the 
options seen in Figure 16-14.
These options allow you to set up a screensaver with bright colors or to randomly 
display photos. Rather than having a digital photo display that would cost over 
$100, your phone can do it all when it’s being charged. Sweet!
If these options don’t thrill you, go to the Play Store and search Daydreams. You 
can download apps that display interesting things like the time, motivational 
quotations, battery-charging status, weather forecasts, news, or jokes.

ack in the “old” days, it sure was frustrating to have your regular-feature 
phone lost or stolen. You would lose all your contacts, call history, and 
texts. Even if you backed up all your contacts, you would have to reenter 
them in your new phone. What a hassle.
The good news is that your smartphone saves all your contacts on your email 
accounts. The bad news is that, unless you take some steps outlined in this chapter,  
evildoers could conceivably drain your bank account, get you fired, or even have 
you arrested.
Do I have your attention? Think of what would happen if someone were to get 
access to your PC at home or at work. He or she could wreak havoc on your life.
A malevolent prankster could send an email from your work email address under 
your name. It could be a rude note to the head of your company. It could give 
phony information about a supposedly imminent financial collapse of your com-
pany to the local newspaper. It could be a threat to the U.S. president, generating 
a visit from the Secret Service.
Here’s the deal: If you have done anything with your smartphone as described in this 
book past Chapter 3, I expect you’ll want to take steps to protect your smartphone.  
Chapter 17

This is the burden of having a well-connected device. Fortunately, most of the 
steps are simple and straightforward.
Use a Good Case and Screen Cover
The Samsung Galaxy S7 is sleek and beautiful. The Galaxy S7 Edge has a really 
cool design that draws attention from people walking by. Plus, the front is made 
of Gorilla Glass from Corning. This stuff is super-durable and scratch-resistant.
So why am I telling you to cover this all up? It’s like buying a fancy dress for a 
prom or wedding and wearing a coat all night. Yup. It’s necessary for safe mobile 
computing.
Speaking from personal experience, dropping a Galaxy phone on concrete can 
break the glass and some of the innards. This can happen if you simply keep your 
phone in a pocket.
There are lots of choices for cases. The most popular are made of silicone, plastic, 
or leather. There are different styles that meet your needs from many manu-
facturers. Otterbox is a brand that makes a series of cases for multiple levels of 
protection. The Defender Series for the Galaxy S7, its highest level of protection, 
is seen in black in Figure 17-1. You can get other levels of protection with more 
colors if you prefer.

I am told by the cooler members of my clan that wearing the belt clip is the mod-
ern equivalent of wearing a pocket protector.
The House of Marley offers an attractive and effective solution, as seen in 
Figure 17-2.
You don’t just use a good case so that you can hand off a clean used phone to the 
next lucky owner. A case makes it a little less likely that you will lose your phone. 
Your Galaxy S7 in its naked form is shiny glass and metal, which are slippery. 
Cases tend to have a higher coefficient of friction and prevent your phone from 
slipping out of your pocket when you take a ride in an Uber car.
More significantly, a case protects your phone against damage. If your phone is 
damaged, you have to mail it or bring it to a repair shop. The problem is that many 
people who bring their phones in for repair don’t wipe the personal information 
off their devices. You really hope that the repair shop can pop off the broken piece, 
pop on a new one, and send you on your way. It’s rarely that easy. Typically, 
you need to leave your phone in the hands of strangers for some period of time.  
For the duration of the repair, said strangers have access to the information on 
your phone.
The good news is that most workers who repair phones are professional and will 
probably ignore any information from the phone before they start fixing it.
However, are you sure that you want to trust the professionalism of a stranger? 
Also, do you really want the hassle of getting a new phone? Probably not, so invest 
in a good case and screen cover. There are many options for different manufac-
turers of cases. Be sure to shop around to come up with the ideal combination of 
protection and style right for you.

Put It on Lock Down
The most basic effort you can take to protect your phone is to put some kind 
of a screen lock on your phone. If you’re connected to a corporate network, the 
company may have a policy that specifies what you must do to access your cor-
porate network. Otherwise, you have six choices, listed here in increasing degrees 
of security:
»
» Unlock with a simple swipe across the screen
»
» Unlock with a pattern that you swipe on the screen
»
» Unlock with a PIN
»
» Unlock with a password
»
» Unlock with your fingerprint
»
» Encrypt the data on your SD card
You can select any of the first five of these options in the Lock Screen option in 
Settings. Encrypting everything on your phone (the sixth listed option) has some 
serious implications, so I describe it in more detail later in the chapter, in the 
“Encrypt Your SD Card” section.
If you want to choose one of the first five options, here’s what you do:
1.	 Tap the Settings icon.
This should be old hat by now.
2.	 Tap the Lock Screen and Security link.
This brings up the options seen in Figure 17-3. You set some of the options 
mentioned in the preceding list and others when you follow the next instruc-
tion. This can be a little confusing, but bear with me while I explain your 
options and tell you where to go.
3.	 Tap the Screen Lock Type link.
This brings up the options seen in Figure 17-4. Each option prompts you 
through what it needs before establishing your security selection.
For reasons that sort of make sense, your phone uses some terminology that can 
be confusing. To clarify, the term Screen Lock is an option you can select to prevent 
unauthorized users from getting into your phone. The term Lock Screen is short for 
the action of locking your screen or enabling the Screen Lock option.

Preparing for your Screen Lock option
Regardless of what screen lock you choose, I recommend that you have ready the 
following choices at hand:
»
» An unlock pattern
»
» A PIN
»
» A password
»
» Your fingerprint
To clarify definitions, a PIN is a series of numbers. In this case, the PIN is four 
digits. A password is a series of numbers, upper- and lowercase letters, and some-
times special characters, and is typically longer than four characters. A PIN is 
pretty secure, but a password is usually more secure. Have them both ready, but 
decide which one you would prefer to use.
Selecting among the Screen Lock options
The first option, unlocking your phone with a swipe, fools exactly no one and 
doesn’t slow anyone down. Rather than just having the Home screen appear, your 
phone tells you to swipe your finger on the screen to get to the Home screen. This 
is about as secure as waving at intruders and tossing them your phone, wallet, and 
keys. Let’s keep going.
I recommend drawing out a pattern as the minimum screen-lock option. This is 
quick and easy. Tap the Pattern option on the screen seen in Figure 17-5 to get 
started. The phone asks you to enter your pattern and then asks you to enter it 
again. It then asks you to enter a PIN in case you forget your pattern.
The unlock pattern is a design that you draw with your finger on a nine-dot 
screen, as shown in Figure 17-5.
The image on the right in Figure 17-5 happens to include all nine dots. You do not 
need to use all the dots. The minimum number of dots you must touch is four. The 
upper limit is nine because you can touch each dot only once. As long as you can 
remember your pattern, feel free to be creative.
Be sure to use a PIN you can remember a long time from now. You need this PIN 
only if you forget your pattern. That is a very rare situation for most people.

CHAPTER 17  Ten Ways to Make Your Phone Secure     279
The next two options on the Screen Lock screen, PIN and Password, are more 
secure, but only as long as you avoid the obvious choices. If you insist upon using 
the PIN “0000” or “1111” or the word “password” as your password, don’t waste 
your time. It’s standard operating procedure within the typical den of thieves to 
try these sequences first. That’s because so many people use these obvious choices.
If, someday, you forget your pattern, your PIN, or your password, the only option 
is to do a complete reset of your phone back to original factory settings. In such a 
case, all your texts and stored files will be lost. Try to avoid this fate: Remember 
your pattern, PIN, or password.
Entering your fingerprint
Using your fingerprint to unlock your phone is very convenient. Once you have 
entered your fingerprint, you can set it up so that you simply put your finger on 
the Home button, and your phone will open up to your home page.
There are a few hoops you need to make this happen. You need to give your phone 
enough views of the finger you will use, which can be whichever finger you like, so 
that it is sure that it is you. It also wants to make sure that you, and only you, have 
stored a fingerprint. Your phone can store multiple fingers, and you do not want 
to have any shenanigans going on here, like someone slipping in her fingerprint 
on to your phone. To prevent this from happening, you need to select a security 
option — again a pattern, PIN, or password — to access the fingerprint screen.

If you want to access your phone using a fingerprint, here’s what you do:

(see Figure 17-4).
This will bring up the image seen in Figure 17-6.
2.	 Enter your security selection for fingerprints.
This can be the same pattern, PIN, or password you used for the Home screen. 
Or not. The point is that this is to provide security to changing your fingerprint. 
When you have done this, the screen seen on the left of Figure 17-7 appears.

a congratulations screen on the right letting you know that you are at 100 
percent.
Enjoy this keen sense of accomplishment, because in a moment, you will  
be returned to a screen like the one shown in Figure 17-9. It is similar to 
Figure 17-6, but now has one stored fingerprint.

with a quick swipe. Give it a try. It is very slick!

Encrypt Your SD Card
This is the last Screen Lock option I list earlier in this section for protecting 
your device. It’s an exceptionally secure option: It scrambles every file on your 
microSD card into gibberish, which it rapidly descrambles when you need the 
information. This sounds great; in practice, however, there are some important 
considerations to think about.
First, all this scrambling and descrambling takes processing power away  
from other things, such as running the apps. The loss is hardly noticeable in most 
cases — your phone is awash in processing power — but you never know when it 
may come back to bite you.
After you encrypt your SD card, you can never switch it back to non-encrypted. 
With the Screen Lock options, you can use a PIN for a while, and then switch back 
to the pattern if you want, and live dangerously with the swipe option until you go 
to a password. Not so with the encryption option. You will never, ever, ever, ever 
get it back together.
If you encrypt your SD card and then forget your password, your SD card is toast. 
You won’t be able to use these files ever again. Likewise, if you ever need to reset 
your phone to factory default settings, it won’t remember how to talk to this SD 
card. Once again, toast is the word to describe the SD card and the data on it.
If you’re sure that encryption is for you, here are the steps:
1.	 From the Lock Screen and Security screen (refer to Figure 17-3), tap the 
Other Security Settings link.
2.	 Tap the Encrypt SD Card link.
Doing so brings up the warning screen, as shown in Figure 17-10.
As the screen says, have your battery nicely charged, say, at 80 percent or 
higher, and an hour set aside when you don’t need to use your phone.
3.	 Tap the Encrypt SD Card option.
And off it goes . . . .

As Secure as Fort Knox with Knox
It doesn’t matter whether you bought the phone at a retail store or your company 
supplied it to you. The fact of the matter is that company data that resides on your 
phone belongs to your employer. You probably signed a document (now sitting in 
your HR file) that states that you agree with this arrangement.
This policy is necessary for the company because it has a financial and legal  
obligation to protect company data, particularly if it pertains to individual  
customers. Like it or not, this obligation trumps your sense of privacy over the 
phone you bought and (still) pay for. If this really gets under your skin, you can 
always carry two smartphones: one for business and one for personal use. This 
solves the problem, but it’s a hassle.
However, there is a better way. Samsung has a highly skilled group that has 
developed a secure system called Knox. Knox logically divides your phone into two 
modes: one for business use and the other for your personal use. You tap an icon, 
and you’re in business mode. You tap another icon, and you’re in personal mode. 
Switching between the two is instant, and Knox keeps the information from each 
mode separate.
FIGURE 17-10: 
The 
encryption 
warning

CHAPTER 17  Ten Ways to Make Your Phone Secure     285
This is a capability that is only of interest to you if your employer offers support 
for the service.
While this sounds very cool, the Galaxy S7 does not have this capability at  
launch. The Samsung Knox website at www.samsung.com/us/business/short-
form/galaxy-s7 assures us that it will be available at some point. In the  
meantime, download and read the brochure “Samsung KNOX For Dummies” to whet 
your appetite.
When it is available, Knox comes with three capabilities for the employer:
»
» Security for the Android OS
»
» Limitations on the applications that access the business side of your phone
»
» Remote mobile-device management
This arrangement means that your employer can remotely control the business 
apps and potentially wipe the data on the business side at its discretion — but it 
has nothing to do with your personal information. The personal side remains your 
responsibility.
You may want to suggest to your company’s IT department that it look into  
supporting Knox. Doing so can take a burden off your back.
Create a Private Mode
If you follow these guidelines, you are pretty safe from outside threats. Your phone, 
however, is not always solely in your possession. For example, parents, guardians, 
and grandparents may let younger kids entertain themselves with their phone. Or, 
you may be the envy of all the other folks at the country club with your new Galaxy 
S7, and they may want to take a look at it because they’re considering buying one 
for themselves. As the standard-bearer of mobile fashion among your peers, you 
are only too proud to let them examine your phone.
Let’s say, however, that they start looking at your Gallery. This may be a problem.
You may have personal images from that “special someone” in your life. You may 
have images from a recent bachelor/bachelorette party. You may have pictures 
from a different phase of your life.

286     PART 6  The Part of Tens
It is safe to say that almost all of us have certain images or files that we want 
on our phone but would just as soon not have them shared. Private mode is the 
answer for you.
Here is how it works logically. First, you turn private mode on. You use a pattern, 
PIN, or password (again, it is up to you if you use the same or different pattern, 
PIN, or password). Then you select which images and files you want to be private.
When private mode is on, you can see these files and that they are marked private. 
When private mode is off, these files do not show up. It is as if they never existed 
in the first place.
When you turn private mode back on, which involves using your pattern, PIN, or 
password, it is all there, and works as good as new. The following steps walk you 
through this process.
1.	 Tap the Settings icon.
2.	 Tap the Lock Privacy and emergency link.
This brings up the options seen in Figure 17-11.
FIGURE 17-11: 
The Privacy 
and emergency

3.	 Tap the Private mode link.
This brings up the options seen in Figure 17-12. Each option prompts you 
through what it needs before establishing your security selection.
4.	 Tap the toggle to on
5.	 Enter your pattern, PIN, or password selection.
Again, old hat. You are now in private mode. You can now go find the image or 
file you want to make private.
6.	 Open the Gallery and find that “special” image you want to keep for you,  
but not for prying eyes.
This could also be any document you access with the My files app. For the 
purposes here, I have taken one of those notorious “silly kid” pictures that 
parents have used to generate copious amounts of embarrassment among 
their children since soon after Joseph Nicéphore Niépce invented photography 
in the 19th century.

To reduce the likelihood that you get caught by forgetting to turn privacy mode 
off, I suggest you use the Auto off option seen in Figure 17-12. Selecting this option 
will automatically turn privacy mode to off when you turn off your phone. You 
need to go to the trouble of turning privacy mode on, but it reduces the chances 
that you will forget.
Be Careful with Bluetooth
In Chapter 3, I looked at syncing your phone with Bluetooth devices. I did not 
mention the potential for security risk at that point. I do it now.
Some people are concerned that people with a radio scanner can listen in on their 
voice calls. This was possible, but not easy, in the early days of mobile phone use. 
Your Galaxy S7 can use only digital systems, so picking your conversation out of 
the air is practically impossible.
Some people are concerned that a radio scanner and a computer can pick up your 
data connection. It’s not that simple. Maybe the NSA could get some of your data that 
way using complicated supercomputing algorithms, but it’s much easier for thieves 
and pranksters to use wired communications to access the accounts of the folks who 
use “0000” as their PIN and “password” or “password1” as their password.

Perhaps the greatest vulnerability your phone faces is called bluejacking, which 
involves using some simple tricks to gain access to your phone via Bluetooth.
Do a test: The next time you’re in a public place, such as a coffee shop, a restau-
rant, or a train station, turn on Bluetooth. Tap the button that makes you visible 
to all Bluetooth devices and then tap Scan. While your Bluetooth device is visible, 
you’ll see all the other Bluetooth devices in your vicinity. You’ll probably find lots 
of them. If not, try this at an airport. Wow!
If you were trying to pair with another Bluetooth device, you’d be prompted to 
see whether you’re willing to accept connection to that device. In this case, you 
are not.
However, a hacker will see that you are open for pairing and take this opportunity 
to use the PIN 0000 to make a connection. When you’re actively pairing, your 
Bluetooth device won’t accept an unknown device’s offer to pair. But if your device 
is both unpaired and visible, hackers can fool your Bluetooth device and force a 
connection.
After a connection is established, all your information is available to the hackers 
to use as they will. Here are the steps to protect yourself:
»
» Don’t pair your phone to another Bluetooth device in a public place. 
Believe it or not, crooks go to public places to look for phones in pairing mode. 
When they pair with a phone, they look for interesting data to steal. It would 
be nice if these people had more productive hobbies, like Parkour or search-
ing for Bigfoot. However, as long as these folks are out there, it is safer to pair 
your Bluetooth device in a not-so-public place.
»
» Make sure that you know the name of the device with which you want 
to pair. You should pair only with that device. Decline if you are not sure or if 
other Bluetooth devices offer to connect.
»
» Shorten the default time-out setting. The default is that you will be visible 
for two minutes. However, you can go into the menu settings and change the 
option for Visible Time-out to whatever you want. Make this time shorter than 
two minutes. Don’t set it to Never Time Out. This is like leaving the windows 
open and the keys in the ignition on your Cadillac Escalade. A shorter time of 
visibility means that you have to be vigilant for less time.
»
» From time to time, check the names of the devices that are paired to 
your device. If you don’t recognize the name of a device, click the Settings 
icon to the right of the unfamiliar name and unpair it. Some damage may 
have been done by the intruder, but with any luck, you’ve nipped it in the bud.

CHAPTER 17  Ten Ways to Make Your Phone Secure     291
Here’s an important point: When handled properly, Bluetooth is as secure as can 
be. However, a few mistakes can open you up to human vermin with more techni-
cal knowledge than decency. Don’t make those mistakes, and you can safely enjoy 
this capability, knowing that all the data on your phone is safe.
Protect Against Malware
One of the main reasons application developers write apps for Android is that 
Google doesn’t have an onerous preapproval process for a new app to be placed 
in the Play Store. This is unlike the Apple App Store or Microsoft Windows Phone 
Store, where each derivation of an app must be validated.
Many developers prefer to avoid bureaucracy. At least in theory, this attracts more 
developers to do more stuff for Android phones.
However, this approach does expose users like you and me to the potential for 
malware that can, inadvertently or intentionally, do things that are not adver-
tised. Some of these “things” may be minor annoyances, or they could really mess 
up your phone (for openers).
Market forces, in the form of negative feedback, are present to kill apps that are 
badly written or are meant to steal your private data. However, this informal safe-
guard works only after some poor soul has experienced problems — such as theft 
of personal information — and reported it.
Rather than simply avoiding new apps, you can download apps designed to protect 
the information on your phone. These are available from many of the firms that 
make antivirus software for your PC. Importantly, many of these antivirus appli-
cations are free. If you want a nicer interface and some enhanced features, you can 
pay a few dollars, but it isn’t necessary.
Examples include NG Mobile Security and Antivirus, Lookout Security and Antivirus, 
Kaspersky Mobile Security, and Norton Security Antivirus. If you have inadvertently 
downloaded an app that includes malicious software, these apps will stop that app.
Don’t Download Apps from Just Anywhere
Another way to avoid malware is to download mobile software only from trust-
worthy websites. This book has focused exclusively on the Google Play Store. You 
can download Android apps for your phone from a number of other reputable 
sites, including Amazon Appstore and GetJar.

292     PART 6  The Part of Tens
Keep in mind that these stores are always on the lookout to withdraw appli-
cations that include malicious software. Google uses an internally developed  
solution it calls Bouncer to check for malicious software and remove it from 
the Play Store. Other mobile software distribution companies have their own 
approaches to addressing this problem. The problem is that policing malicious 
software is a hit-or-miss proposition.
As a rule, you should hesitate to download an Android application unless you 
know where it has been. You are safest if you restrict your app shopping to repu-
table companies. Be very skeptical of any other source of an Android application.
Rescue Your Phone When It Gets Lost
Other options allow you to be more proactive than waiting for a Good Samaritan to 
reach out to your home phone or email if you lose your phone.
There are apps that help you find your phone. Here are a few several “lost it”  
scenarios and some possible solutions for your quandary:
You know that you lost your phone somewhere in your house. You would try calling your 
own number, but you had your phone set to Vibrate Only mode.
Remote Ring: By sending a text to your phone with the “right” code that you 
preprogrammed when you set up this service, your phone will ring on its loudest 
setting, even if you have the ringer set to Vibrate Only.
If you know that your phone is in your house, the accuracy of GPS isn’t savvy 
enough to tell you whether it’s lost between the seat cushions of your couch or in 
the pocket of your raincoat. That’s where the Remote Ring feature comes in handy.
You lost your phone while traveling and have no idea whether you left it in a taxi or at 
airport security.
Map Current Location: This feature allows you to track, within the accuracy of 
the GPS signal, the location of your phone. You need access to the website of the 
company with which you arranged to provide this service, and it will show you (on 
a map) the rough location of your phone.
Here is where having an account with Samsung comes in handy. Hopefully, you 
signed up for a Samsung Account when you first got your phone. If you did, you 
are signed up for the Find My Mobile at http://findmymobile.samsung.com. 
Figure 17-15 shows the Find My Mobile PC screen.

CHAPTER 17  Ten Ways to Make Your Phone Secure     293
All you need to do is get to a PC and sign in to your Samsung account. You can tell 
your phone to ring by clicking on Ring my device. You can have the PC bring up a 
map by clicking Locate my device.
I suggest trying these out before you lose your phone the first time.
Wipe Your Device Clean
As a last-ditch option, you can use Find My Mobile (see preceding section) to 
remotely disable your device or wipe it clean. Here are some of the possible 
scenarios:
You were robbed, and a thief has your phone.
Remote Lock: After your phone has been taken, this app allows you to create a 
four-digit PIN that, when sent to your phone from another mobile phone or a web 
page, locks down your phone. This capability is above and beyond the protection

294     PART 6  The Part of Tens
you get from your Screen Lock and prevents further access to applications, phone, 
and data.
If you know that your phone was stolen — that is, not just lost — do not try to track 
down the thief yourself. Get the police involved and let them know that you have 
this service on your phone — and that you know where your phone is.
You are a very important executive or international spy. You stored important plans on 
your phone, and you have reason to believe that the “other side” has stolen your phone 
to acquire your secrets.
Remote Erase: Also known as Remote Wipe, this option resets the phone to its fac-
tory settings, wiping out all the information and settings on your phone.
You can’t add Remote Erase after you’ve lost your phone. You must sign up for your 
Samsung service beforehand. It’s not possible to remotely enable this capability to 
your phone. You need to have your phone in hand when you download and install 
either a lock app or a wipe app.

Ten Features to Look 
for Down the Road
W
ith the power of your Samsung Galaxy S7 and the flexibility offered in 
Android applications development, it can be difficult to imagine that 
even more capabilities could be in the works. In spite of this, the fol-
lowing are ten features that would improve the usability and value of your Galaxy 
S7 phone.
Smarter Customer Care for Your Phone
You may not realize this, but your cellular carrier lives on pins and needles during 
the first few weeks after you get your new phone. This is the period when you can 
return your phone, no questions asked. Once you go past that date, you cannot 
cancel your contract without a lot of hassle on your part.
This is why, if you bring your phone back to the store reporting a problem, your 
carrier will tend to swap out your old phone for a brand new one.
Usually, you’ll just take the new phone and walk out with a big smile on your face. 
This outcome is good customer care for most products — but not necessarily good 
customer care for smartphones. The reason? One of the most common sources of 
Chapter 18

296     PART 6  The Part of Tens
trouble has nothing to do with the phone at all. The problem is the customer isn’t 
using it right.
For example, you may have left your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on all the time, causing 
your battery to drain too fast. You may have left your phone on your dashboard 
and cooked the battery. Or, through no fault of your own, you may have down-
loaded two badly written apps that conflict with each other, causing the CPU in 
the phone to run nonstop as these two apps battle it out for resources. The prob-
lem here is that unless someone spends the time to help you with the underlying 
problem, you’ll be back in the store with the same problem.
At that point, however, you cannot return your phone. If you’re sympathetic, or 
very annoying, your carrier may give you a refurbished phone. You walk out of 
the store, but without the biggest smile on your face. Unfortunately, nobody dealt 
with the underlying trouble, so you’ll be back, once again, with the same problem.
No surprise if you start to think that the problem is with that darn phone. In fact, 
the store needs to listen to you about how you’re using the phone and then help 
you get the most out of it. This is hard to do in a retail environment where the 
sales force is under pressure to sell lines of service and gets no concrete reward 
for helping you with your problem.
This is where smarter customer care comes in. With the proper tools, you can 
work with a product expert to troubleshoot your phone. Some companies spe-
cialize in understanding the underlying problems and coming up with solutions 
for consumers. This kind of customer care costs the carriers a little more, but it 
makes for fewer unnecessary returns of perfectly good phones — and for much 
happier customers.
Control of Your Home Electronics
Traditional home appliances are getting smarter, offering more capabilities for 
better performance. A problem they have is that adding rows of control buttons 
(so that you can control those new capabilities) complicates manufacture. So the 
next generation of appliances has begun to add a small LCD screen to the appli-
ance. This can look slick, but it costs a lot and is prone to breakage. Also, the 
fancy capabilities involve pushing a confusing combination of buttons with cryp-
tic messages displayed on a tiny screen.
The latest idea is to omit the screen altogether and to give you control of the set-
tings through an application on your smartphone. Your appliance retains the very 
basic buttons, but allows you to use the fancy capabilities by setting them through 

CHAPTER 18  Ten Features to Look for Down the Road     297
your phone. You just download the free application made by the manufacturer 
from the Google Play Store, and you have your beautiful and logical user interface 
to control your new product. No strings attached.
For example, your new oven will allow you to turn it on and set the temperature 
without using a smartphone. However, if you want it to start preheating at 5:30 
so that you can put the casserole in right when you walk in the door, you set that 
up through your phone.
Many of us have such capabilities on our ovens. In practice, however, features 
that aren’t used regularly don’t become intuitive — and finding the instruction 
manual is often too much of a hassle.
An application written on your Galaxy S7, on the other hand, can be very intuitive. 
In just a few taps, the oven temperature will be ready when you walk in the door.
Even cooler — or is that hotter? — you don’t need to be nearby. You could be at 
the office when you change your oven’s settings. The oven will never know the 
difference.
In support of this vision, a leading provider of home appliances announced an inte-
grated solution for its appliances. This leading company, Samsung, announced its 
SmartThings hub as a part of its Smart Home initiative. You can now get a touch-
screen on your refrigerator that will show you links to your appliances. Check it 
out the next time you plan to redo your kitchen.
Entertainment Selector
The traditional view is that consumers sit in front of TVs when they want to be 
entertained and at PCs when they want to do something productive or communi-
cate electronically. These clear distinctions have blurred since it became possible 
to watch movies and TV on a PC.
Now that you have HD resolution on your phone, it’s not unreasonable to use your 
phone to do some channel-surfing. When you find what you want, and if it’s con-
venient, you switch to the big-screen TV.
Although such a scenario has been technologically possible in the past, the extreme 
resolution of your phone makes it convenient and a viable alternative to firing up 
the big-screen TV in another part of the house.

298     PART 6  The Part of Tens
The technology is present to make this vision a reality. However, it’s not nearly 
as convenient as it could be. Today, you need to open the right applications or 
select the right channels. It would be convenient if your phone could communicate  
with the TV and have the TV find the right program, and vice versa. It would be 
slick if the phone could watch your eyes and detect when you have taken them off 
the TV screen, just as it can when you take your eyes off the phone screen.
Serving You Better
The smartphone is the mechanism that companies use to find a better way to 
serve you. This will show up in a few ways.
The first is in much better mobile advertising. There has been talk for a long time 
that advertisers can tell where you are and then give you ads or coupons based 
upon your proximity. This is just now starting to become a reality. It’s still kinda 
clumsy. If you have been Googling, say, televisions, you may see ads relating to 
sales about televisions. In the future, however, your phone may tell you about a 
sale going on for Samsung televisions when you walk by the Sears store in the 
mall. That is cool.
Even cooler is to be told that that particular model is on sale at the Sears store and 
that this particular sale is the best in town by over $20. This can happen if you are 
doing research at the moment. It may be possible for your app to flag you if you 
have ever done this kind of research on the Internet.
The second way smartphones are enhancing service is by automating the order-
taking process. For example, wherever you see a video kiosk, that company can 
allow you to interact with the information on the kiosk with your Samsung Galaxy 
S7. Some fast-food restaurants have installed kiosks so that customers can bypass 
the line to order from the menu. The items are totaled and paid for by credit card. 
The customer steps aside and waits for his or her number to be called.
This exact transaction could take place on your smartphone. You don’t have to 
wait while the guy in front of you struggles to decide between a double cheese-
burger or two single cheeseburgers . . . and hold the pickles. Instead, you can place 
your order on your smartphone and wait with eager anticipation to find out what 
toys are in your kid’s meal.

CHAPTER 18  Ten Features to Look for Down the Road     299
Placing You Indoors
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is great. It can tell you precisely your  
location on the road and off the road. Chapter 11 covers how it can help you get to 
where you want to be.
There is a confession to be made. GPS doesn’t work so well within buildings. Once 
you are in a building, your phone only kind of knows where you are. The satellite 
responsible for sending out signals so that your phone can figure out your position 
is no longer visible, and the GPS in your phone waits patiently until it sees another 
satellite. Until then, it stops trying to figure out where you are.
This is rarely a problem if you are, say, at your home. It is probably only a few 
thousand square feet. Things are altogether different if you are wandering around 
the Palazzo Casino in Las Vegas. At 6.95 million square feet, this building has the 
most floor area of any building in the United States.
You could be anywhere in the 160 acres of luxury resort space. It is unfortunate if 
the Carnevino Steakhouse sends you a mobile coupon offering a two-for-one meal 
to your Galaxy S7 while you are already sitting in the Delmonico Steakhouse. It can 
be a tragedy if you start choking on too big a bite of your porterhouse steak and 
emergency services cannot find you.
There are some efforts out there to come up with a better way to locate you when 
you are indoors. One approach has been to estimate your location based upon sig-
nal strength of known Wi-Fi access points. Companies that hire a large number 
of smarticles (smart people) are trying a variety of technologies to address this 
problem. May the best company win so that we may all get better location-based 
services!
Augmenting Your Reality
You may have seen augmented reality in science fiction shows. The idea is that you 
pull up an application on your smartphone that directs your camera viewfinder 
to locate and identify via pop-up windows what you’re looking at. For example, 
you hold up your phone while you’re walking down the street, and it will tell you 
the addresses of the buildings that it sees and offer information on the buildings’ 
tenants.
What is happening is that your phone camera is performing image recogni-
tion in real time and then doing a look-up of information. It all sounds pretty 

300     PART 6  The Part of Tens
straightforward. Your Galaxy S7 has a high-resolution camera along with massive 
amounts of processing power and the connectivity to get real-time information. 
Augmented reality apps are just around the corner.
A word of caution though: Augmented reality has been just around the corner 
for at least a decade. This is a really cool idea, and it makes for a really inter-
esting demonstration with prototypes. However, we are still waiting for good 
implementations.
It is likely that the first successful implementations will be on a small scale, such 
as an art museum offering an app that would allow you to use your camera to tell 
you the pieces of art you are looking at as you stroll through the galleries.
Other implementations could be augmented shopping. Say that it is time to refur-
nish your living room. You no longer have to imagine how that furniture you see 
in the store would fit. You take a 360 degree shot of the room you want to redo. 
You virtually toss out the old sofa and put in the new one you see at the showroom. 
It is properly sized within your room as you rearrange the layout. This is far more 
convenient than having them deliver the sofa in the “meat” world only to find 
that the new furniture does not fit.
More and Better Health Sensors
Chapter 16 mentions the health and fitness sensors that are starting to come on 
the market. These are just the beginning.
Currently, you can get devices that track a single function, such as heartbeat or 
the oxygen level in your blood. There are prototypes of multifunction devices that 
track several vital signs.
One factor that helps drive this market is that the number of smartphone  
users has been growing like gangbusters over the past few years. The number of 
smartphones sold exceeded the number of dumb phones as of 2014 and shows no 
sign of slowing. Phones without health sensors are now the exception rather than 
the rule.
Finally, these devices have the potential to improve your health. It won’t be too 
long before first responders can have the information to render better services 
faster because they’ll know many of the patient’s vital signs (via smartphone) 
before they even leave the station.

CHAPTER 18  Ten Features to Look for Down the Road     301
Better 911 Services
The 911 system has been keeping the United States safe for more than 45 years. 
The dirty secret of this service is that the underlying technology used to com-
municate information on the caller’s location hasn’t been updated in a long time.
To put this in perspective, your smartphone is designed to work with data at up 
to 300 million bits per second. When you call 911, the phone that answers your 
call is designed to work with data at up to 120 bits per second. (Seriously. I am not 
making this up.)
Many states and regions are trying to address this problem. This effort is called 
next-generation 911, or NG911. NG911 promises to make the information you 
already have on your phone available to the people who are sending you help. This 
new technology is slowly being implemented region by region in different states 
and counties.
For example, most 911 dispatchers can’t access the data from the health sensors 
described in the previous section. With NG911, you can set up your phone so that 
first responders receive your vital signs and EKG the moment they get the call to 
respond to your emergency.
With a larger data pipeline between your smartphone and the first responders, 
you can send anything that’s relevant, including medical history, your emergency 
contacts, insurance data, and whether you have any protection orders against 
stalkers. All this information can help you — and it’s available right away because 
regardless of where you happen to be, your phone is typically there with you.
Less Worry about Charging
Samsung is highly focused on addressing the complaint many consumers have 
about the need to pay attention to charging. The battery technology in the S7 and 
the S7 Edge is denser and larger. The fast charging with wireless is impressive. 
Finally, while there are lots of portable chargers on the market, Samsung went so 
far as to introduce its own portable chargers.
The one flat note in the fast charging story is that the S7 uses the slower micro-
USB connector. If it had used the micro-USB Type-C to include smart charging, it 
would have had a perfectly consistent story.

302     PART 6  The Part of Tens
As it is, even with all these heroic efforts and multiple options, keeping your phone 
charged requires attention. The future holds the promise that one day wireless 
options will be so ubiquitous that we as users won’t have to worry about this. 
Our phones will be charged and maintain that charge without the need for much 
attention or action.
Information Finder
Your smartphone, which is turned on all the time, is very handy if you just need 
to know the location of the 1994 Winter Olympic Games or the title of Virginia 
Madsen’s first movie. (By the way, it’s Lillehammer, Norway, and the 1983 movie 
Class.)
On the other hand, if you want to write a research report on the relative merits of 
a flat tax compared to a value-added tax, you’re probably better off working on a 
PC. This latter project is best done with a full keyboard and large screen. The time 
to turn on the PC, watch it boot up, sign in, and connect with the Internet is small 
when compared to the time spent doing the research and writing.
In between these extremes, your phone is increasingly becoming the preferred 
tool for accessing information. The ergonomics of the screen, the convenience of 
the search tools, and the availability of applications all contribute to your phone 
being the primary source of daily information in lieu of your PC.
What this means to you is that your investment in your next PC should take into 
account how you use your smartphone. You may need less PC, depending on your 
information-collection habits.
