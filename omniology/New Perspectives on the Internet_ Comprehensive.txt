The New Perspectives Series’ critical-thinking, problem-solving approach is the ideal way 
to prepare students to transcend point-and-click skills and take advantage of all that the 
Internet has to offer. 
In developing the New Perspectives Series, our goal was to create books that give students 
the software concepts and practical skills they need to succeed beyond the classroom. We’ve 
updated our proven case-based pedagogy with more practical content to make learning 
skills more meaningful to students. 
With the New Perspectives Series, students understand why they are learning what they 
are learning, and are fully prepared to apply their skills to real-life situations.
About This Book
This book provides complete coverage of using the Internet and its technologies, and includes 
the following:
• 
Hands-on steps for searching the Web and evaluating the available resources to 
determine their validity, credentials, timeliness, and accuracy
• 
Hands-on steps for using Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Google 
Chrome, and for creating and using a Windows Live Hotmail email account
• 
In-depth and expanded coverage of social networks, wireless technology and net-
works, security countermeasures for various types of threats, and protecting individ-
ual privacy and avoiding identity theft
• 
E-commerce coverage updated and revised to reflect the consumer’s perspective of 
buying and selling on the Web, Internet advertising and marketing, PayPal and digi-
tal wallets, consumer concerns, and international issues
• 
Updated and new case problems at the end of every tutorial
New for this edition! 
• 
Each session begins with a Visual Overview, a new two-page spread that includes 
colorful, enlarged graphics with numerous callouts and key term definitions, giving 
students a comprehensive preview of the topics covered in each session, as well as 
a handy study guide.
• 
New ProSkills boxes provide guidance for how to use the Web in real-world, profes-
sional situations.
• 
Comprehensive ProSkills exercises at the end of Tutorials 5 and 9 integrate the skills 
students learn in the tutorials with one or more of the following soft skills: decision 
making, problem solving, teamwork, verbal communication, and written communi-
cation. These comprehensive exercises provide an opportunity for students to com-
plete more challenging, thought-provoking assignments that reinforce the critical 
thinking skills taught in the tutorials.

New Perspectives Series
System Requirements
This book assumes that Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 (or higher), Mozilla Firefox 5 (or higher), 
or Google Chrome, and Windows 7 are installed. (Students using Internet Explorer 8 (or 
lower) or Firefox 4 (or lower) and Windows Vista or XP can still complete the steps in this 
book, but they might encounter some differences.) Note that the figures and steps in this edi-
tion were written using Windows 7; therefore, Windows Vista/XP users might notice minor dif-
ferences in the figures and steps. This book assumes that students have a complete installation 
of the Web browser and its components, an Internet connection, and are able to create an 
email account. Because the Web browser or email account students use might be different 
from those used in the figures in this book, students’ screens might differ slightly; this differ-
ence does not present any problems for students completing the tutorials.

Internet, 9th Edition, Comprehensive
The New Perspectives Approach
Context
Each tutorial begins with a problem presented in a “real-world” case that is meaningful to 
­students. The case sets the scene to help students understand what they will do in the tutorial.
Hands-on Approach
Each tutorial is divided into manageable sessions that combine reading and hands-on, step-by-step 
work. Colorful screenshots help guide students through the steps. Trouble? tips anticipate com-
mon mistakes or problems to help students stay on track and continue with the tutorial. 
Visual Overviews
New for this edition! Each session begins with a Visual Overview, a new two-page spread that 
includes colorful, enlarged screenshots with numerous callouts and key term definitions, giv-
ing students a comprehensive preview of the topics covered in the session, as well as a handy 
study guide.
ProSkills Boxes and Exercises
New for this edition! ProSkills boxes provide guidance for how to use the software in real-
world, professional situations, and related ProSkills exercises integrate the technology skills 
students learn with one or more of the following soft skills: decision making, problem solving, 
teamwork, verbal communication, and written communication. 
InSight Boxes
InSight boxes offer expert advice and best practices to help students achieve a deeper under-
standing of the concepts behind the software features and skills.
Margin Tips
Margin Tips provide helpful hints and shortcuts for more efficient use of the software. The Tips 
appear in the margin at key points throughout each tutorial, giving students extra information 
when and where they need it.
Assessment
Retention is a key component to learning. At the end of each session, a series of Quick Check 
questions helps students test their understanding of the material before moving on. Engaging 
end-of-tutorial Review Assignments and Case Problems have always been a hallmark feature of 
the New Perspectives Series. Colorful bars and brief descriptions accompany the exercises, mak-
ing it easy to understand both the goal and level of challenge a particular assignment holds.
Reference
Within each tutorial, Reference boxes appear before a set of steps to provide a succinct sum-
mary and preview of how to perform a task. In addition, each book includes a combination 
Glossary/Index to promote easy reference of material.

New Perspectives Series
Our Complete System of Instruction
Coverage To Meet Your Needs
Whether you’re looking for just a small amount of coverage or enough to fill a semester-long 
class, we can provide you with a textbook that meets your needs.
 • Brief books typically cover the essential skills in just 2 to 4 tutorials. 
 • Introductory books build and expand on those skills and contain an average of 5 to 
8 tutorials. 
 • Comprehensive books are great for a full-semester class, and contain 9 to 12+ tutorials.
So if the book you’re holding does not provide the right amount of coverage for you, there’s 
probably another offering available. Go to our Web site or contact your Course Technology 
sales representative to find out what else we offer.
CourseCasts – Learning on the Go. Always available…always relevant. 
Want to keep up with the latest technology trends relevant to you? Visit our site to find a 
library of podcasts, CourseCasts, featuring a “CourseCast of the Week,” and download them 
to your mp3 player at http://coursecasts.course.com.
Our fast-paced world is driven by technology. You know because you’re an active participant—
always on the go, always keeping up with technological trends, and always learning new ways 
to embrace technology to power your life. 
Ken Baldauf, host of CourseCasts, is a faculty member of the Florida State University Computer 
Science Department where he is responsible for teaching technology classes to thousands of 
FSU students each year. Ken is an expert in the latest technology trends; he gathers and sorts 
through the most pertinent news and information for CourseCasts so your students can spend 
their time enjoying technology, rather than trying to figure it out. Open or close your lecture 
with a discussion based on the latest CourseCast.

dents to train and test on important computer skills in an active, hands-on environment.

most commonly used Microsoft Office applications. SAM simulates the Office application 
environment, allowing students to demonstrate their knowledge and think through the skills 
by performing real-world tasks, such as bolding text or setting up slide transitions. Add in live-
in-the-application projects, and students are on their way to truly learning and applying skills 
to business-centric documents.
Designed to be used with the New Perspectives Series, SAM includes handy page references,

Case	|	Danville Animal Shelter
The Danville Animal Shelter is an organization devoted to help-
ing improve the welfare of animals, particularly unwanted pets, in 
the local Danville area. Trinity Andrews, the director of the shelter, 
is always looking for ways to improve the services it offers to the 
community.
The shelter is a charitable organization that is supported mainly 
by contributions from the local community. Trinity budgets the 
limited funds that the shelter receives to do the most good for 
the animals. One of the most important functions of the shelter 
is to let people in the community know about the pets available 
for adoption. Advertising in the local newspaper or on television 
stations is very expensive. Another problem is that the pets avail-
able for adoption change from day to day and, by the time a news 
story or ad runs, the pet that is featured often has been adopted. 
Although newspaper and television advertising and promotion can 
be a good way for the shelter to get its general message out to the 
community, these outlets are not the best way to let people know 
about specific pets that are available for adoption.
You have volunteered at the shelter for several years, and Trinity 
heard that you were learning to use the Internet. Trinity wants you 
to help identify ways to use the Internet to let the community know 
about the shelter and, in particular, about specific pets that are 
available for adoption. To do this, you need to learn more about 
using a Web browser. 
Note: If you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer as your Web 
browser, you should complete Session 1.1. If you are using Mozilla 
Firefox as your Web browser, then skip Session 1.1 and complete

Session 1.1 Visual Overview
The Navigation bar is used to open 
and move among Web pages as well 
as access favorites and commands 
for saving and printing.
The Favorites bar includes buttons 
that provide links to saved shortcuts 
to Web pages (called favorites) that 
you visit frequently.
You use the Favorites Center to 
organize and display links to your 
preferred Web sites, RSS feeds, and 
recently visited sites.
A Web page is a document 
that has been created using 
HTML, a programming 
language used to format 
documents containing text 
and images so they can be 
viewed in a Web browser.
You type the Uniform Resource 
Locator (URL), or the address 
for a Web page, in the Address 
bar to open that Web page in 
the browser.
Internet Explorer is a Web 
browser, which is software you 
run on your computer to make it 
run as a Web client, allowing it to 
locate and display Web pages.
The Refresh button loads a 
new copy of the Web page 
in the browser window.

Internet | Tutorial 1 Browser Basics
The Internet and the Web
Computers can be connected to each other in a configuration called a network. When 
networks are connected to each other, the system is called an interconnected network or 
internet (with a lowercase “i”). The Internet (with an uppercase “i”) is a specific inter-
connected network that connects computers all over the world using a common set of 
interconnection standards. Although it began as a computer science project sponsored 
by the U.S. military, the Internet today allows people and businesses all over the world to 
communicate with each other in a variety of ways.
The part of the Internet known as the World Wide Web (or the Web) is a collection 
of files that reside on computers, called Web servers, that are connected to each other 
through the Internet. Most files on computers, including computers that are connected 
to the Internet, are private; that is, only the computer’s users can access those files. The 
owners of the computer files that make up the Web have made the files publicly avail-
able by placing them on the Web servers. Thus, anyone who has a computer connected 
to the Internet can obtain access to the files.
When you use an Internet connection to become part of the Web, your computer 
becomes a Web client. A Web browser is software that allows your computer to con-
nect to, locate, retrieve, and display Web content. You can read Appendix A to learn 
more about the history of the Internet and the Web, how they work, and the technologies 
behind their operation.
INSIGHT
Choosing a Browser
There are a variety of Web browsers available. Some of the most common are Microsoft 
Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Opera. You can 
download and install these browsers for free, enabling you to choose the one you want. 
All Web browsers have similar features, but some are more robust and others are more 
streamlined. To help evaluate and decide which Web browser you want to use, you 
can read reviews, explore the product pages, take tours or demos of the browsers, and 
download and try them.
Hypertext Markup Language and Hyperlinks
The public files on Web servers are ordinary text files, much like the files created and 
used by word-processing software. To enable Web browser software to read these files, 
the text must be formatted according to a generally accepted standard. The standard used 
on the Web is Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTML uses codes, or tags, that tell 
the Web browser software how to display the text contained in the text file. For example, 
a Web browser reading the following line of text
<B>A Review of the Book <I>Wind Instruments</I></B>
recognizes the <B> and </B> tags as instructions to display the entire line of text in bold 
and the <I> and </I> tags as instructions to display the text enclosed by those tags in 
italic. Different Web clients that connect to this Web server might display the tagged text 
differently. For example, one Web browser might display text enclosed by bold tags in 
a blue color instead of displaying the text in bold. A text file that contains HTML tags is 
called an HTML document.
HTML provides a variety of text formatting tags that can be used to indicate headings, 
paragraphs, bulleted lists, numbered lists, and other text enhancements in an HTML 
document. (You will learn more about HTML tags in Tutorial 8.) The real power of HTML, 
however, lies in its anchor tag. The HTML anchor tag enables Web designers to link

HTML documents to each other. Anchor tags in HTML documents create hypertext links, 
which are instructions that point to other HTML documents or to another section of the 
same document. Hypertext links also are called hyperlinks or links. The linked HTML 
documents can be on the same computer or on different computers. These comput-
ers can be anywhere in the world if they are connected to the Internet. When a Web 
browser displays an HTML document, it is often referred to as a Web page.
Starting Microsoft Internet Explorer
Microsoft Internet Explorer is the Microsoft Web browser; it is installed with all recent 
versions of the Windows operating system software. In this session, you will use the 
Internet Explorer Web browser to do your work for the Danville Animal Shelter. This 
introduction assumes that you have Internet Explorer installed on your computer.
To start Internet Explorer:

2.	 If the program window does not fill the screen entirely, click the Maximize button 
on the title bar. Your screen should look similar to the Session 1.1 Visual Overview.
Trouble?  Your computer will open to the home page for your installation of 
Internet Explorer, or no page at all.
Trouble?  The Session 1.1 Visual Overview shows the Internet Explorer program 
window with the Command bar, Favorites bar, and Favorites Center displayed. 
Some or all of these may be hidden on your screen. You will learn how to custom-
ize the program window later in this session. In addition, other programs can add 
icons and toolbars to the Internet Explorer program window. So if you are using 
a computer that has been used by other people or your own computer on which 
other software has been installed, you might see icons and toolbars that are not 
shown in the Session 1.1 Visual Overview.
Trouble?  The Session 1.1 Visual Overview shows the Favorites Center open on the 
left side of the browser window. Your Favorites Center might not be open on your 
screen. This is not a problem; you will open the Favorites Center later in this session.
The very first time Internet Explorer starts, only the Navigation bar is displayed in the 
program window. The Navigation bar contains the Address bar for opening Web pages; 
the Back and Forward buttons for navigating among previously visited pages; the tabs for 
open Web pages; and the Home, Tools, and View favorites, feeds, and history buttons 
to access the most common Command bar functions. This streamlined version provides 
more screen space for viewing Web pages. 
You can, however, display additional toolbars, including the Command bar and the 
Favorites bar, which are shown the Session 1.1 Visual Overview. You can also custom-
ize the toolbars by deleting icons and adding new icons. Internet Explorer allows you to 
change the toolbar settings because some people like to have many commands avail-
able on the screen, while others prefer to have more space available for displaying the 
Web page. Also, other software programs installed on your computer can place icons on

the Internet Explorer toolbars so that you can use these programs from within Internet 
Explorer. As a result, your Internet Explorer browser window might have different tool-
bars displayed or the toolbars might contain icons not shown in the Visual Overview.
Customizing the Internet Explorer Window
In Internet Explorer, you can display or hide the menu bar and toolbars as needed. The 
menu bar and toolbars are hidden by default. When they are hidden, more of the Web 
page is displayed in the browser window. To display the menu bar or a toolbar, right-
click a blank area of the Navigation bar, and then click the corresponding option on the 
shortcut menu. If the Command bar is displayed, you can click the Tools button on the 
Command bar, point to Toolbars, and then select or deselect the corresponding option to 
display or hide the menu bar or a toolbar. 
At any point, you can switch to Full screen mode, which temporarily hides the pro-
gram window—the title bar, the Navigation bar, the menu bar, and any toolbars as well 
as the Windows taskbar—leaving only the Web page visible on your screen. You can 
select the Full screen option by clicking Tools on the Command bar, and then click-
ing Full screen. When the window is in Full screen mode, you can display the hidden 
toolbars by pointing to the top of the screen. When you move the pointer away from the 
toolbars, they will become hidden again. To exit Full screen mode, point to the top of the 
screen until the toolbars appear, click the Tools button on the Command bar, and then 
click Full screen to remove the check mark and deselect this option.

Now that you are familiar with the tools in the browser window, you are ready to 
navigate to a Web site. 
Navigating Web Pages
To identify a particular Web page’s exact location on the Internet, Web browsers rely on 
an address called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The URL is the address of a specific 
Web page. Every Web page has a unique URL. A URL is a four-part addressing scheme 
that tells the Web browser:
• The protocol to use when transporting the file
• The domain name of the computer on which the file resides
• The path for the folder or directory on the computer in which the file resides
• The name of the file
So in the URL http://www.nytimes.com/pages/sports/index.htm, the http:// is the 
transfer protocol, which is the set of rules that computers use to move files from one 
computer to another. The two most common protocols used to transfer files on the 
Internet are Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP). The 
second part of the URL, the domain name, is www.nytimes.com and this references the 
location of the computer on which the Web page resides; www indicates the computer 
is connected to the Web, nytimes is the name of the Web site, and .com identifies the 
Web site as being a commercial organization. The /pages/sports portion of the URL pro-
vides the path for the folder in which the Web page file is located, and the last portion of 
the URL, index.htm, is the filename.
Entering a URL in the Address Bar
You can use the Address bar, which is located on the Navigation bar, to enter a specific 
URL and go directly to that Web page. For example, you can enter the complete URL for 
a Web site, such as http://www.cnn.com, to load that Web page in the browser. As you 
begin to type, a list opens, displaying pages you have previously visited that begin with 
the letters you are typing; you can select a URL and press the Enter key to return to that 
Web page. Also, Internet Explorer will try to complete partial URLs that you type in the 
Another way to switch Full 
screen mode on and off is 
to press the F11 key.

Address bar. For example, if you type cnn.com, Internet Explorer will convert it to  
http://www.cnn.com and load the Web page at that URL. 
If you don’t see the URL you want in the Address bar list, you can enter a partial 
URL or a search word; Internet Explorer will open the search engine selected for your 
browser. A search engine performs a search based on the text you type in a search box—
in this case, the Address bar—and displays the search results. You can click any link in 
the search results to go to that Web page. You will learn more about search engines in 
Tutorial 3.
INSIGHT
Understanding Home Pages
The term “home page” is used at least three different ways on the Web, and it is 
sometimes difficult to tell which meaning people intend when they use the term. The 
first definition of home page indicates the main page that all of the other pages on a 
particular Web site are organized around and link back to. This home page is the first 
page that opens when you visit that Web site. The second definition of “home page” 
is the first page that opens when you start your Web browser. This type of home page 
might be an HTML document on your own computer. Some people create such home 
pages and include hyperlinks to Web sites that they frequently visit. If you are using a 
computer on your school’s or employer’s network, its Web browser might be configured 
to open the main page for the school or firm. The third definition of “home page” is 
the Web page that a particular Web browser loads the first time you use it. This page 
usually is stored at the Web site of the firm or other organization that created the Web 
browser software. Home pages that meet the second or third definitions are sometimes 
called start pages.
Trinity wants you to start your research by examining the Midland Pet Adoption Agency’s 
Web site. She has provided the URL for the site’s home page.
To load the Midland Pet Adoption Agency’s home page:

Written Communication: The Importance of Organization in a Web Site
Web sites are written communications media just as printed brochures and newsletters 
are. When visiting a Web site, you can learn a great deal about how to create a Web site 
for your organization, just as you can learn to design brochures by reading brochures 
produced by other organizations. The writing that appears on a Web site’s pages must be 
organized to reflect the organization’s communication goals for the site. For example, the 
Midland Pet Adoption Agency’s main page includes links to information that it believes 
Web site visitors will be seeking, such as:
• Pets available for adoption (including their names and pictures)
• Training programs offered
• The agency’s emergency clinic
• Directions to the agency and contact information
The Midland Pet Adoption Agency’s Web site is organized so that each of these 
information sets appears on its own Web page. The links are organized on the home 
page in order of importance, from left to right. For example, the first link next to the 
Home page link is the Pets link, which opens a page of information about pets available 
for adoption. This is the agency’s primary mission and is the most important set of 
information it wants to convey to site visitors.
Another important point in organizing the Web site is that the navigation tools (in this 
case, the links) should appear in the same place and in the same form on every page. This 
consistent structure reinforces the site visitors’ knowledge that the site is well organized 
and tells them that they are still on the same Web site. For example, the Home page link 
appears in the upper-left corner of all the site’s pages, providing the visitors a consistent 
means to return to the site’s main page. The use of common color combinations and 
consistent headers and graphics (for example, the use of the same two graphics at the 
top of each page, along with the reminder to “Take me home today!”) reinforces the 
primary message of the Web site, which is to encourage visitors to stop by and adopt a 
pet, and conveys a sense of urgency regarding doing so.
Good written communications are clearly organized around a theme that conveys the 
message while guiding readers to the most important information in a direct way. You can 
accomplish this in a Web site by understanding what your site’s visitors will be looking for, 
and structuring your site to organize that information and make it easy to find.

Clicking Links
Most Web pages include links to other Web pages. A link might open a Web page that 
is related to the original Web page, such as the Pets link on the Midland Pet Adoption 
Agency home page, which opens a page listing pets available for adoption. A link could 
also be a link to a company, such as the Course Technology link at the bottom of the 
home page. Other times, a link could open a Web page with related information or an 
advertised product or service. The easiest way to move from one Web page to another is 
to click a link on the open Web page. You’ll use links to open the Training Programs and 
Pets Web pages.
To use links to navigate the Midland Pet Adoption Agency Web site:
◗	
1.	 On the Midland Pet Adoption Agency home page, point to the Training 
Programs link, as shown in Figure 1-2. The pointer changes to the shape of a 
hand with a pointing index finger, and a ScreenTip listing the URL to which the 
link points appears near the bottom of the browser window.

2.	 Click the Training Programs link. The Training Programs Web page opens in the 
browser window.

Moving Among Visited Web Pages
The Back and Forward buttons on the Navigation bar let you navigate among the pages 
you have just visited. When you first start Internet Explorer, these buttons are grayed out. 
After you visit more than one Web page in a browsing session, the Back button changes 
to blue, indicating that it is active and available. Clicking the Back button returns the 
browser to the previous Web page you visited. You can continue clicking the Back but-
ton until you reach the first page you viewed when you started Internet Explorer. Once 
you click the Back button, the Forward button changes to blue, and you can click the 
Forward button to return to later pages you have visited. 
As you move among the pages you visited, you might want to reload, or refresh, a 
Web page you return to. The Refresh button on the Navigation bar loads a new copy 
of the Web page that currently appears in the browser window. Internet Explorer stores 
a copy of every Web page it displays on your computer’s hard drive in a Temporary 
Internet Files folder in the Windows folder. Storing this information increases the speed 
at which Internet Explorer can display pages as you move back and forth through the 
Web pages you have visited because the browser can load the pages from a local disk 
drive instead of reloading them from the remote Web server. When you click the Refresh 
button, Internet Explorer contacts the Web server to see if the Web page has changed 
since it was stored in the Temporary Internet Files folder. If it has changed, Internet 
Explorer gets the new page from the Web server; otherwise, it loads the copy stored on 
your computer.
You’ll use the Back, Forward, and Refresh buttons to navigate among the Web pages 
you visited on the Midland Pet Adoption Agency Web site.
To navigate among visited pages on the Midland Pet Adoption 
Agency Web site:

Using the Page Tabs
So far, all the Web pages you have visited have been displayed on the same tab. You can 
open additional page tabs on the tab row next to the Address bar and load different Web 
pages on each tab instead of opening additional Web pages in separate browser windows. 
This tabbed browsing technique is especially useful when you need to open many pages 
or move frequently back and forth among multiple Web pages. 
There are several methods for opening a Web page in a new tab. You can click the 
New Tab button on the tab row, and then open a Web page as usual. You can right-click 
a link on a Web page, and then click the Open in new tab command on the shortcut 
menu. Or, you can press the Ctrl key as you click a link. To close a tab, you click the 
Close Tab button on that page tab. If you have only one tab open, closing that tab also 
exits Internet Explorer. Conversely, if you try to exit Internet Explorer when you have 
more than one tab open, a dialog box opens, asking whether you want to close the cur-
rent tab or all open tabs.

tab allows you to create a favorite, which is a stored shortcut containing the URL of a 
Web page. You create, organize, and access your stored favorites on the Favorites tab. 
The Feeds tab is used to store and organize RSS feeds, which provide content published 
by a Web site that is updated often. The History tab records your browsing activity by 
organizing and storing the URLs of the Web sites you have visited by date, site, most

Creating and Organizing Favorites
As you use the Web to find information, you can create favorites so you can easily 
return to sites of interest. You might very quickly find yourself creating so many favorites 
that it is difficult to find a specific favorite. When you start accumulating favorites, it is 
helpful to keep them organized so that you can quickly locate the site you need. On 
the Favorites tab, you can add, delete, and organize favorites into folders that best suit 
your needs and working style. You can also add favorites that you want to access very 
frequently to the Favorites bar, which is a toolbar that appears below the Address bar on 
which you create buttons to access favorites. Keep in mind that the favorites and folders 
you create are available only on the computer on which you are working.

◗	 11.	 Click Midland Pet Adoption Agency. The Midland Pet Adoption Agency home 
page opens in the browser.
In the previous set of steps, you created a favorite and a folder in which to store it. 
You can also create folders and move existing favorites into these folders on the Favorites 
tab of the Favorites Center. You can reorganize the favorites and folders stored in the 
Favorites Center at any point, such as by creating new folders and rearranging favorites 
and folders within folders.
You saved the Midland Pet Adoption Agency’s URL as a favorite, which you stored in 
a new folder named Pet Adoption Agencies in the Favorites Center. Because Trinity might 
want you to collect information about adoption agencies in different states as you con-
duct your research, you will organize the information about adoption agencies by state. 
The Midland Pet Adoption Agency is located in Minnesota, so you will put information 
about the Midland Pet Adoption Agency in a separate folder named MN (the two-letter 
abbreviation for Minnesota) within the Pet Adoption Agencies folder. As you collect 
information about other agencies, you will add folders for the states in which they are 
located, too.
To move the Midland Pet Adoption Agency favorite into a new folder:
◗	
1.	 In the Favorites Center, right-click the Pet Adoption Agencies folder, and then 
click Create new folder on the shortcut menu. A new folder appears in the 
Favorites Center, with the default folder name “New folder” selected.
◗	
2.	 Type MN as the folder name, and then press the Enter key to rename the folder. 
Now that you have created a folder, you can move your favorite for the Midland 
Pet Adoption Agency Web page into the new folder.
◗	
3.	 If necessary, click the Pet Adoption Agencies folder to open it, and then click 
and drag the Midland Pet Adoption Agency favorite to the new MN folder, as 
shown in Figure 1-9.

Deleting Favorites and Folders from the Favorites Center
Creating favorites is a great way to keep track of sites you know you want to visit on a 
regular basis. However, sometimes you no longer want to visit a site, such as when you 
saved favorites related to a specific project. Other times, the URL for a site has changed 
or the site no longer exists. In all these instances, you’ll want to delete the favorites and 
the folders in which they are stored. You can delete a specific favorite, or you can delete 
a folder in the Favorites Center. When you delete a folder, the folder and all of its con-
tents are moved to the Recycle Bin.
To delete the folders and favorites you created:
◗	
1.	 In the Favorites Center, right-click the Midland Pet Adoption Agency favorite 
in the MN folder, and then click Delete on the shortcut menu. The favorite is 
deleted.
◗	
2.	 In the Favorites Center, right-click the Pet Adoption Agencies folder, and then 
click Delete on the shortcut menu. The Delete Folder dialog box opens so you 
can confirm that you want to move the folder to the Recycle Bin.
◗	
3.	 Click the Yes button. The folder and all of its contents are deleted from the 
Favorites Center.
◗	
4.	 Click the Close the Favorites Center button on the Favorite Center’s title bar to 
close the Favorites Center.
◗	
5.	 On the Favorites bar, right-click the Midland Pet Adoption Agency link, and then 
click Delete on the shortcut menu. The favorite is deleted from the Favorites bar.

Navigating Web Pages Using the History List
Creating favorites is a great way to keep track of sites you know you want to visit on a 
regular basis. Another way to return to a site that you have visited recently is with the 
history list. The history list, which you open by clicking the History tab in the Favorites 
Center, is useful when you know you visited a site recently, but you did not create a 
favorite and you cannot recall the URL of the site. From the History tab, you can view a 
list of the sites that were visited on that computer during the last three weeks. You can 
display the history of visited sites organized by date, by site, by sites most visited, or by 
the order visited on a single day. You can also use the History tab to search for a specific 
site. To return to a specific Web page, just click its link in the history list.
Not every site that you visit as you research pet adoption sites for Danville Animal 
Shelter will warrant being saved as a favorite. The history list will be helpful if you want 
to show Trinity the breadth of sites you visited during your research. You will view the 
history list next.
To view the history list for this session:
◗	
1.	 Click the View favorites, feeds, and history button on the Navigation bar, 
and then click the History tab in the Favorites Center. The pages that you have 
visited are grouped by date of visit, so the last icon in the list is labeled “Today” 
and includes Web sites you visited today. The other icons are labeled with the 
names of days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, and so on) if Internet Explorer has 
been used regularly. If not, the icons will be labeled with week names (Last Week, 
Two Weeks Ago, and so on).
◗	
2.	 Click the Today icon to open a list of folders for the Web sites you visited today. 
Clicking a folder opens a list of the links to each page on that site that you visited 
today in the order in which you visited them. 
◗	
3.	 Click the midlandpet (www.midlandpet.com) folder. See Figure 1-12. Each 
page you visited on the Midland Pet Adoption Agency site is stored in this folder 
in the order you visited it. Notice the home page for the site appears in the list 
more than once because you navigated back to that page from the other pages 
on the site. To return to a particular page, click that page’s entry in the list. 
If you are using a com-
puter in a computer lab 
or a public computer, the 
history list will include sites 
visited by anyone who has 
used the computer, not 
just you.
You can see the full URL of 
any item in the history list 
by pointing to that item.

Erasing Your Browsing History
In some situations, such as when you are finishing a work session in a school computer 
lab or on any public computer, you might want to remove the list of Web sites that you 
visited from the history list of the computer on which you had been working. Erasing 
your browsing history helps protect your personal information and guard your privacy 
when working on a shared computer. You can delete your browsing history in Internet 
Explorer by clicking the Tools button on the Navigation bar or Command bar, and then 
clicking Internet options to open the Internet Options dialog box. In the Browsing his-
tory section of the General tab, click the Delete button to open the Delete Browsing 
History dialog box. Click the History check box to select it (unless it is already selected). 
If any other check boxes are selected, click each of them to clear the selections. After 
ensuring that only the History box is checked, click the Delete button to erase the entire 
browsing history stored on the computer.
Managing Cookies
All Web browser users should know about the use of cookies. A cookie is a small text 
file that a Web server saves on the hard drive of the computer that is running the Web 
browser software. A cookie is used to store information about your visit to a specific 
Web site, such as your login name and password, which pages you viewed, and your 
shopping cart information if you purchased something from the Web site. By storing this 
information on your computer, the Web server can retrieve the information when you 
return to that site, enabling it to perform functions such as automatic login, which makes 
it easier to sign in to Web pages you have visited before. However, the user often is 
unaware that cookie files are being written to the computer’s hard drive.
When the site you are visiting places a cookie on your computer, it is called a first-
party cookie. However, many cookies are written by companies that sell advertising on 
Web pages. The advertising elements of the Web page are delivered by the advertisers’ 
Web servers, not the Web server of the site you are visiting. These cookies record which 
ads have appeared on Web pages you have viewed. Advertisers use these cookies to 
determine which ads they will deliver the next time you open a Web page. This can be 
beneficial because it prevents sites from showing you the same ads over and over again. 
On the other hand, many people believe that this sort of user tracking is an offensive 
invasion of privacy. Cookies that are placed by companies other than the company 
whose Web site you are visiting are called third-party cookies.
Most Web browsers, including Internet Explorer, allow you to block cookies from your 
computer or to specify general categories of cookies (such as first-party or third-party) 
to block. In Internet Explorer, you can specify privacy settings that control the writing 
of cookie files to your computer’s hard drive. You can specify which types of cookies 
to block or you can block particular types of cookies from specific sites. These options 
are available on the Privacy tab in the Internet Options dialog box. You will learn more 
about the different types of cookies, how they work, and how best to deal with them in 
Tutorial 6.
Internet Explorer stores each cookie in a separate file. You can delete the cookies from 
your computer at any time or whenever you exit Internet Explorer. To delete all of the 
cookies stored on your computer, click the Tools button on the Navigation bar or the

On the General tab, click the Delete button in the Browsing history section to open the 
Delete Browsing History dialog box. In this dialog box, you click the Cookies check box 
to select it (unless it is already selected). Clear any other check boxes for items you do 
not want to delete, and then click the Delete button.
Because some cookies benefit users, you might not want to delete all of the cookies 
on your computer. For example, if you regularly visit a site that requires you to log in, 
the Web server can store your login information in a cookie on your computer so you do 
not have to type your user name each time you visit the site. You should always consider 
carefully whether the advantages of cookies outweigh the disadvantages for you before 
you delete all of your Internet Explorer cookies.

Private Web Browsing
As you have learned, Internet Explorer stores a considerable amount of information 
about your Web browsing activity. It stores a list of all the Web pages you have viewed in 
the history list, and it stores cookies that can contain information about your logins and 
passwords. It even stores information about which ads have been displayed on the Web 
pages you have viewed.
Internet Explorer also stores copies of all or part of the Web pages you visit on what-
ever computer you are using. If you do not wish to have this information stored, you can 
use Internet Explorer in InPrivate Browsing mode. In InPrivate Browsing mode, Internet 
Explorer does not store your browsing history, cookies, or copies of the Web pages you 
visit. In other words, there is no record in Internet Explorer of what sites you visited and 
what you looked at. When you are using a computer other than your own (such as a 
friend’s computer or a computer at work, school, or another public location), InPrivate 
Browsing mode can help protect your privacy and security.
To start InPrivate Browsing, you can click the New Tab button to open a new tab, and 
then click the InPrivate Browsing link. You can also start an InPrivate Browsing session 
by clicking the Safety button on the Command bar or by clicking the Tools button on 
the Navigation bar, pointing to Safety, and then clicking InPrivate Browsing, which then 
opens a new browser window with the “InPrivate is turned on” page displayed in the 
browser window, the InPrivate label on the page tab, and the InPrivate indicator to the 
left of the Address bar. 
As you visit Web pages in the InPrivate Browsing browser window or in any tabs in 
that window, the history list of the session, cookies from that session, and temporary 
Internet files will be tracked only while the InPrivate Browsing browser window is open. 
When you close the InPrivate Browsing browser window, the history list, cookies, and 
temporary Internet files are removed from your computer.
REFERENCE
Opening an InPrivate Browsing Session
• Click the New Tab button to open a new tab and then click the InPrivate Browsing 
link (or click the Tools button on the Navigation bar, point to Safety, and then click 
InPrivate Browsing; or click the Safety button on the Command bar, and then click 
InPrivate Browsing).
• Enter a URL in the Address bar to navigate to a Web site, and navigate to other Web 
pages by clicking links or open pages in other tabs as usual. 
• To turn off InPrivate Browsing, click the Close button on the Internet Explorer title bar 
to close the browser window and all open tabs.
You will try an InPrivate Browsing session to see how it differs from the Web browsing 
you have done earlier in this session. 
To start an InPrivate Browsing session:
◗	
1.	 Click the Safety button on the Command bar, and then click InPrivate Browsing. 
A new browser window opens, displaying a Web page with the message “InPrivate

4.	 Click the Close button on the Internet Explorer title bar to close the browser win-
dow and end the InPrivate Browsing session. You return to the browser window

If you examine the browser’s history listing, you will see that it includes no record 
of the Web pages you just visited. Although the browser does not record the pages you 
have visited (or other information, such as cookies), the network server that connects the 
computer to the Internet might have software that does. Therefore, it is best not to rely on 
InPrivate Browsing mode to keep private the Web pages you visit while using a computer 
at work or another public location.

Saving Web Page Content
At times you will want to refer to the information that you have found on a Web page 
without having to return to the site. In Internet Explorer, you can save entire Web pages, 
particular graphics, or selected portions of Web page text. 
Saving an Entire Web Page 
When you save the entire Web page, you use the Save Webpage dialog box, which is 
similar to the Save As dialog box in other programs. To open the Save Webpage dialog 
box, click the Tools button on the Navigation bar, point to File, and then click Save as. 
You can also click the Page button on the Command bar, and then click Save as to open 
the Save Webpage dialog box. 
Internet Explorer by default saves the complete Web page, including the graphic page 
elements along with the Web page’s text and the HTML markup codes. You can select a 
different format from the Save as type list in the Save Webpage dialog box. The Webpage, 
HTML only format saves the Web page’s text along with the HTML markup codes. The 
Text File format saves the Web page’s text without the HTML markup codes. The Web 
Archive, single file format saves the Web page in a proprietary archive format (the .mht 
format) that can be read by Internet Explorer Web browsers, but not necessarily other 
Web browsers. Avoiding the Internet Explorer proprietary format will ensure that anyone 
using another Web browser can read the page you saved.
You will save the Midland Pet Adoption Agency home page to show to Trinity. This 
Web site will provide Trinity an example of a well-designed site with appropriate text 
and graphics.
To save the Midland Pet Adoption Agency home page:
◗	
1.	 Return to the Midland Pet Adoption Agency home page.
◗	
2.	 Click the Page button on the Command bar, and then click Save as. The Save 
Webpage dialog box opens.
◗	
3.	 Navigate to and select the Tutorial.01\Tutorial folder included with your Data 
Files. This is the location where you will save the Web page. 
Trouble?  If you don’t have the starting Data Files, you need to get them before 
you can proceed. Your instructor will either give you the Data Files or ask you to 
obtain them from a specified location (such as a network drive). In either case, 
make a backup copy of the Data Files before you start so that you will have 
the original files available in case you need to start over. If you have any ques-
tions about the Data Files, see your instructor or technical support person for 
assistance.

INSIGHT
Understanding Copyright for Web Page Content
A copyright is the legal right of the author or other owner of an original work to control 
the reproduction, distribution, and sale of that work. A copyright comes into existence 
as soon as the work is placed into a tangible form, such as a printed copy, an electronic 
file, or a Web page. Copyright laws can place significant restrictions on the way that you 
can use information or images that you copy from another entity’s Web site. Because 
of the way a Web browser works, it copies the HTML code as well as the graphics and 
media files to your computer before it can display them in the browser. Just because 
copies of these files are stored temporarily on your computer does not mean that you 
have the right to use them in any way other than having your computer display them in 
the browser window.
The United States and most other countries have copyright laws that govern the use 
of photocopies, audio or video recordings, and other reproductions of authors’ origi-
nal work. The copyright exists even if the work does not contain a copyright notice. If 
you do not know whether material that you find on the Web is copyrighted, the safest 
course of action is to assume that it is.
U.S. copyright law has a fair use provision that allows a limited amount of copy-
righted information to be used for purposes such as news reporting, research, and 
scholarship. The source of the material used should always be cited. Commercial use 
of copyrighted material is much more restricted. You should obtain permission from 
the copyright holder before using anything you copy from a Web page. The copyright 
holder can require you to pay a fee for permission to use the material from the Web 
page. The steps in this tutorial are designed so that your use of copyrighted Web pages 
and elements of those pages falls within the fair use provisions of U.S. copyright law.
Copying Text from a Web Page
You can also copy and paste portions of a Web page to a file or email. This can be help-
ful when you want to save specific information from a Web page, such as a schedule of 
events, directions to a location, or information about a place. 
Trinity plans to visit the Midland Pet Adoption Agency while she is traveling in 
Minnesota next week. She wants to contact Midland’s director and schedule a meeting. 
You can copy and paste the agency’s address and telephone number from its Web site 
into a document or an email for Trinity.
To copy and paste text from the Midland Pet Adoption Agency Web site:
◗	
1.	 On the Directions & Contact page, select the address and telephone number for 
Midland Pet Adoption Agency at the top of the page. 
◗	
2.	 Right-click the selected text, and then click Copy on the shortcut menu to 
copy the selected text to the Clipboard, which is a temporary storage area in 
Windows. 
◗	
3.	 Click the Start button on the taskbar, point to All Programs, click the 
Accessories folder, and then click WordPad to start the program and open a

Printing a Web Page
Sometimes you will want to print a Web page. This might occur when you want to keep 
a printed page for reference, save a record or receipt of an online purchase, or have a 
coupon to use at a local store or restaurant. As with other programs, you can send the 
displayed page directly to the printer by clicking the Print button on the Command bar, 
or you can select options in the Print dialog box by clicking the Print button arrow on 
the Command bar and then clicking Print. The Print dialog box includes options for 
selecting a printer, setting a page range, and specifying the number of copies to print.

You can also use the Page Setup dialog box to change aspects of a Web page printout, 
including the page size and orientation, margins, and headers and footers that print at 
the top and bottom of the page, respectively. The default header prints the Web page 
title in the left section, nothing in the center section, and the page number and the total 
number of pages in the right section. The default footer prints the URL in the left section, 
nothing in the center section, and the date in the right section. To open the Page Setup 
dialog box, click the Print button arrow on the Command bar, and then click Page setup. 
Before printing a Web page, you should preview what the printout will look like to 
ensure that it will print in the best way possible. For example, you want to ensure that 
extra or unnecessary pages won’t print, that the printed page is legible, and that what 
will print is what you wanted to print. This extra step helps you to save resources, includ-
ing paper and printer ink. To open the Print Preview window, click the Print button arrow 
on the Command bar, and then click Print preview. The Print Preview window shows 
how the current Web page will look on the printed page. It also provides access to com-
mon printing options. From the toolbar, you can open the Print dialog box, change the 
page orientation, open the Page Setup dialog box, toggle headers and footers on or off, 
change the number of pages in the preview, and adjust the print size. Changing the print 
size enables you to shrink the Web page to fit better on the page or enlarge the Web 
page on the printout so it’s more legible.

Internet | Tutorial 1 Browser Basics
The Internet and the Web
Computers can be connected to each other in a configuration called a network. When 
networks are connected to each other, the system is called an interconnected network or 
internet (with a lowercase “i”). The Internet (with an uppercase “i”) is a specific inter-
connected network that connects computers all over the world using a common set of 
interconnection standards. Although it began as a computer science project sponsored 
by the U.S. military, the Internet today allows people and businesses all over the world to 
communicate with each other in a variety of ways.
The part of the Internet known as the World Wide Web (or the Web) is a collection 
of files that reside on computers, called Web servers, that are connected to each other 
through the Internet. Most files on computers, including computers that are connected 
to the Internet, are private; that is, only the computer’s users can access those files. The 
owners of the computer files that make up the Web have made the files publicly avail-
able by placing them on the Web servers. Thus, anyone who has a computer connected 
to the Internet can obtain access to the files.
When you use an Internet connection to become part of the Web, your computer 
becomes a Web client. A Web browser is software that allows your computer to con-
nect to, locate, retrieve, and display Web content. You can read Appendix A to learn 
more about the history of the Internet and the Web, how they work, and the technologies 
behind their operation.
INSIGHT
Choosing a Browser
There are a variety of Web browsers available. Some of the most common are Microsoft 
Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Opera. You can 
download and install these browsers for free, enabling you to choose the one you want. 
All Web browsers have similar features, but some are more robust and others are more 
streamlined. To help evaluate and decide which Web browser you want to use, you 
can read reviews, explore the product pages, take tours or demos of the browsers, and 
download and try them.
Hypertext Markup Language and Hyperlinks
The public files on Web servers are ordinary text files, much like the files created and 
used by word-processing software. To enable Web browser software to read these files, 
the text must be formatted according to a generally accepted standard. The standard used 
on the Web is Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTML uses codes, or tags, that tell 
the Web browser software how to display the text contained in the text file. For example, 
a Web browser reading the following line of text
<B>A Review of the Book <I>Wind Instruments</I></B>
recognizes the <B> and </B> tags as instructions to display the entire line of text in bold 
and the <I> and </I> tags as instructions to display the text enclosed by those tags in ital-
ics. Different Web clients that connect to this Web server might display the tagged text 
differently. For example, one Web browser might display text enclosed by bold tags in 
a blue color instead of displaying the text in bold. A text file that contains HTML tags is 
called an HTML document.
HTML provides a variety of text formatting tags that can be used to indicate headings, 
paragraphs, bulleted lists, numbered lists, and other text enhancements in an HTML 
document. (You will learn more about HTML tags in Tutorial 8.) The real power of HTML, 
however, lies in its anchor tag. The HTML anchor tag enables Web designers to link 
HTML documents to each other. Anchor tags in HTML documents create hypertext links, 
which are instructions that point to other HTML documents or to another section of the 
same document. Hypertext links also are called hyperlinks or links. The linked HTML

documents can be on the same computer or on different computers. These comput-
ers can be anywhere in the world if they are connected to the Internet. When a Web 
browser displays an HTML document, it is often referred to as a Web page.
Starting Mozilla Firefox
Mozilla Firefox is a Web browser currently maintained by the Mozilla Foundation. If you 
want to use Firefox as your Web browser, you usually need to download and install the 
software. In this session, you will use the Firefox Web browser to do your work for the 
Danville Animal Shelter. This introduction assumes that you have Firefox installed on 
your computer.
To start Firefox:
◗	
1.	 Click the Start button on the taskbar, point to All Programs, and then click 
Mozilla Firefox. After a moment, Firefox opens.
Trouble?  If you cannot find Mozilla Firefox on the All Programs menu, check to 
see if a Mozilla or Firefox shortcut icon appears on the desktop, and then double-
click it. If you do not see the shortcut icon, ask your instructor or technical sup-
port person for help. The program might be installed in a different location on 
the computer you are using.
◗	
2.	 If the program window does not fill the screen entirely, click the Maximize button 
on the title bar. Your screen should look similar to the Session 1.2 Visual Overview.
Trouble?  The Session 1.2 Visual Overview shows the Mozilla Firefox Start page, 
which is the page that Firefox opens the first time the program is started after 
being installed on a computer. Your computer will almost certainly be configured 
to open to a different Web page, or no page at all.
Trouble?  The Session 1.2 Visual Overview shows the Mozilla Firefox program 
window with the Navigation toolbar and Bookmarks toolbar displayed with the 
new tabs opened on top. Some of these may be hidden on your screen. You will 
learn how to customize the program window later in this session. In addition, 
other programs can add icons and toolbars to the Firefox program window. So 
if you are using a computer that has been used by other people, or your own 
computer on which other software has been installed, you might see icons and 
toolbars that are not shown in the figure.
Trouble?  If the Bookmarks toolbar shown in the Session 1.2 Visual Overview is 
not displayed on your screen, click the Firefox button, point to Options, and then 
click Bookmarks Toolbar to check this option and display the toolbar.
Trouble?  If you don’t see a page tab in the browser window as shown in the 
Session 1.2 Visual Overview, then your browser is set to hide page tabs when 
only one Web site is open. Click the Firefox button, point to Options, and then 
click Options to open the Options dialog box. Click the Tabs icon in the Options 
dialog box, and then click the Always show the tab bar check box to select it. 
Click the OK button to close the dialog box.
The very first time Firefox starts, only the Firefox button and the Navigation toolbar 
are displayed in the program window. The Firefox button provides access to all of the 
features and functions available in Firefox. The Navigation toolbar contains the Location 
bar for opening Web pages, the Go back one page and Go forward one page buttons 
for navigating among previously visited pages, the Search bar for finding specific Web 
pages, and the Home and Bookmarks buttons to go to your start page or favorite sites. 
This streamlined version provides more screen space for viewing Web pages.

Internet | Tutorial 1 Browser Basics
You can, however, display additional toolbars, including the Bookmarks toolbar, 
which is shown in the Session 1.2 Visual Overview. You can also customize the toolbars 
by deleting icons and adding new icons. Firefox allows you to change the toolbar set-
tings because some people like to have many commands available on the screen, while 
others prefer to have more space available for displaying the Web page. Also, other 
software programs installed on your computer can place icons on the Firefox toolbars 
so that you can use these programs from within Firefox. As a result, your Firefox browser 
window might have different toolbars displayed or the toolbars might contain icons not 
shown in the Visual Overview.
Customizing the Firefox Window
In Firefox, you can display or hide the menu bar and toolbars as needed. When the 
menu bar and toolbars are hidden, more of the Web page is displayed in the browser 
window. The menu bar and most toolbars are hidden by default. To display the menu bar 
or a toolbar, right-click a blank area of the Navigation toolbar, and then click the cor-
responding option on the shortcut menu. You can also display or hide the menu bar or a 
toolbar by clicking the Firefox button, pointing to Options, and then clicking the corre-
sponding option to display or hide the menu bar or a toolbar. 
At any point, you can switch to Full Screen mode, which temporarily hides the 
program window—the Firefox button, the Navigation toolbar, and any other toolbars as 
well as the Windows taskbar—leaving only the Web page visible on your screen. You 
can switch to Full Screen mode by clicking the Firefox button and selecting Full Screen 
on the menu. When the window is in Full Screen mode, you can display the hidden 
toolbars by pointing to the top of the screen. When you move the pointer away from the 
toolbars, they will become hidden again. To exit Full Screen mode, point to the top of 
the screen until the toolbars appear, right-click a blank area above the Navigation tool-
bar, and then click Exit Full Screen Mode on the shortcut menu.
REFERENCE
Hiding and Restoring Toolbars in Firefox
• To switch to Full Screen mode, click the Firefox button, and then click Full Screen (or 
press the F11 key).
• To temporarily restore the toolbars in Full Screen mode, point to the top of the screen 
until the toolbars appear.
• To exit Full Screen mode, point to the top of the screen to display the toolbars, right-
click a blank area above the Navigation toolbar, and then click Exit Full Screen Mode 
on the shortcut menu (or press the F11 key).
• To display or hide individual toolbars, click the Firefox button, point to Options, and 
then click a toolbar name on the menu (or right-click a blank area of the Navigation 
toolbar, and then click a toolbar name on the shortcut menu). If the toolbar name is 
already checked, the toolbar will be hidden when you click the name. If the toolbar 
name is not checked, the toolbar will be displayed when you click the name.
Next, you will customize the Firefox window by displaying and hiding the toolbars. 
In these tutorials, you will use the Navigation toolbar and the Bookmarks toolbar, so you 
will leave them displayed.
To display and hide toolbars in Firefox:
◗	
1.	 Click the Firefox button, and then point to Options. A menu opens, listing the avail-
able toolbars. A check mark appears to the left of each toolbar that is displayed.

Now that you are familiar with the tools in the browser window, you are ready to 
navigate to a Web site.
Navigating Web Pages
To identify a particular Web page’s exact location on the Internet, Web browsers rely on 
an address called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The URL is the address of a specific 
Web page. Every Web page has a unique URL. A URL is a four-part addressing scheme 
that tells the Web browser:
• The protocol to use when transporting the file
• The domain name of the computer on which the file resides
• The path for the folder or directory on the computer in which the file resides

URL provides the path for the folder in which the Web page file is located, and the last 
portion of the URL, index.htm, is the filename.
Entering a URL in the Location Bar
You can use the Location bar, which is located on the Navigation toolbar, to enter a specific 
URL and go directly to that Web page. For example, you can enter the complete URL for a 
Web site, such as http://www.cnn.com, to load that Web page. As you begin to type, a list 
opens, displaying pages you have previously visited that begin with the letters you are typing; 
you can select a URL and press the Enter key to return to that Web page. Also, Firefox will 
try to complete partial URLs that you type in the Location bar. For example, if you type cnn.
com, Firefox will convert it to www.cnn.com and load the Web page at that URL. 
If you don’t see the URL you want in the Location bar list, you can use the Search bar 
on the Navigation toolbar to find a specific Web site. You enter a partial URL or a search 
word in the Search bar, and Firefox contacts the search engine selected for your browser. 
A search engine performs a search based on the text you type in a search box—in this 
case, the Location bar—and displays the search results. You can click any link in the search 
results to go to that Web page. You will learn more about search engines in Tutorial 3. 
INSIGHT
Understanding Home Pages
The term “home page” is used at least three different ways on the Web, and it is some-
times difficult to tell which meaning people intend when they use the term. The first 
definition of home page indicates the main page that all of the other pages on a particular 
Web site are organized around and link back to. This home page is the first page that 
opens when you visit that Web site. The second definition of “home page” is the first 
page that opens when you start your Web browser. This type of home page might be 
an HTML document on your own computer. Some people create such home pages and 
include hyperlinks to Web sites that they frequently visit. If you are using a computer on 
your school’s or employer’s network, its Web browser might be configured to open the 
main page for the school or firm. The third definition of “home page” is the Web page 
that a particular Web browser loads the first time you use it. This page usually is stored 
at the Web site of the firm or other organization that created the Web browser software. 
Home pages that meet the second or third definitions are sometimes called start pages.
Trinity wants you to start your research by examining the Midland Pet Adoption 
Agency’s Web site. She has provided the URL for the home page.
To load the Midland Pet Adoption Agency’s home page:
◗	 1.	 Click in the Location bar to select the current URL, and then type  
www.midlandpet.com. This is the URL for the Midland Pet Adoption  
Agency Web site.
Trouble?  The Location bar might display a list of suggested URLs as you type; 
ignore these suggestions and continue typing.

2.	 Press the Enter key. The home page of the Midland Pet Adoption Agency Web 
site loads, as shown in Figure 1-18.

Written Communication: The Importance of Organization in a Web Site
Web sites are written communications media just as printed brochures and newsletters 
are. When visiting a Web site, you can learn a great deal about how to create a Web site 
for your organization, just as you can learn to design brochures by reading brochures 
produced by other organizations. The writing that appears on a Web site’s pages must be 
organized to reflect the organization’s communication goals for the site. For example, the 
Midland Pet Adoption Agency’s main page includes links to information that it believes 
Web site visitors will be seeking, such as:
• Pets available for adoption (including their name and pictures)
• Training programs offered
• The agency’s emergency clinic
• Directions to the agency and contact information
The Midland Pet Adoption Agency’s Web site is organized so that each of these 
information sets appears on its own Web page. The links are organized on the home 
page in order of importance, from left to right. For example, the first link next to the 
Home page link is the Pets link, which opens a page of information about pets available 
for adoption. This is the agency’s primary mission and is the most important set of 
information it wants to convey to site visitors.
Another important point in organizing the Web site is that the navigation tools (in this 
case, the links) should appear in the same place and in the same form on every page. This 
consistent structure reinforces the site visitors’ knowledge that the site is well organized 
and tells them that they are still on the same Web site. For example, the Home page link 
appears in the upper-left corner of all the site’s pages, providing the visitors a consistent 
means to return to the site’s main page. The use of common color combinations and 
consistent headers and graphics (for example, the use of the same two graphics at the 
top of each page, along with the reminder to “Take me home today!”) reinforces the 
primary message of the Web site, which is to encourage visitors to stop by and adopt a 
pet, and conveys a sense of urgency regarding doing so.
Good written communications are clearly organized around a theme that conveys the 
message while guiding readers to the most important information in a direct way. You can 
accomplish this in a Web site by understanding what your site’s visitors will be looking for 
and structuring your site to organize that information and make it easy to find.

Clicking Links
Most Web pages include links to other Web pages. A link might open a Web page that is 
related to the original Web page, such as the Pets link on the home page, which opens a 
page listing pets available from the Midland Pet Adoption Agency. A link could also be a 
link to a company, such as the Course Technology link at the bottom of the home page. 
Other times, a link could open a Web page with related information or an advertised prod-
uct or service. The easiest way to move from one Web page to another is to click a link in 
the open Web page. You’ll use links to open the Training Programs and Pets Web pages.
To use links to navigate the Midland Pet Adoption Agency Web site:
◗	
1.	 On the Midland Pet Adoption Agency home page, point to the Training 
Programs link, as shown in Figure 1-19. The pointer changes to the shape of a 
hand with a pointing index finger, and a ScreenTip listing the URL to which the 
link points appears in the lower-left corner of the browser window.
◗	
2.	 Click the Training Programs link. The Training Programs Web page opens in the 
browser window.
◗	
3.	 On the Training Programs Web page, click the Pets link. The Pets page opens in 
the browser window.

tion about the cat named Maxie opens in the browser window.

Moving Among Visited Web Pages
The Go back one page and Go forward one page buttons on the Navigation bar let you 
navigate among the pages you have just visited. After you visit more than one Web page, 
the arrow in the Go back one page button changes to black, indicating that the button 
is active and available. Clicking the Go back one page button returns the browser to the 
previous Web page you visited. You can continue clicking the Go back one page but-
ton until you reach the first page you viewed when you started Firefox. Once you click 
the Go back one page button, the arrow in the Go forward one page button changes to 
black, and you can click the Go forward one page button to return to later pages you 
have visited. You can also right-click either button to display a list of the Web pages you 
have visited during the session and click a specific name to return to that page.
As you move among the pages you visited, you might want to reload, or refresh, a 
Web page you return to. The Reload current page button on the Navigation toolbar loads 
a new copy of the Web page that currently appears in the browser window. Firefox stores 
a copy of every Web page it displays on your computer’s hard drive in a Temporary 
Internet Files folder in the Windows folder. Storing this information increases the speed 
at which Firefox can display pages as you move back and forth through the Web pages 
you have visited because the browser can load the pages from a local disk drive instead 
of reloading them from the remote Web server. When you click the Reload current page 
button, Firefox contacts the Web server to see if the Web page has changed since it was 
stored in the Temporary Internet Files folder. If it has changed, Firefox gets the new page 
from the Web server; otherwise, it loads the copy stored on your computer.
You’ll use the Go back one page, Go forward one page, and Reload current page but-
tons to navigate among the Web pages you visited on the Midland Pet Adoption Agency 
Web site.
To navigate among visited pages on the Midland Pet Adoption 
Agency Web site:
◗	
1.	 Right-click the Go back one page button on the Navigation toolbar. A shortcut 
menu listing the pages you visited so far appears, as shown in Figure 1-20. The 
current page is in bold type. Clicking the button displays the previous page—in 
this case, the Pets page. Or you can click any page name on the shortcut menu 
to return directly to that page.

Returning to Firefox’s Home Page
When you click the Home button on the Navigation toolbar, the browser displays the 
home (or start) page for your installation of Firefox. You can select one or more pages 
to display as the default home page. If you select multiple pages, each page opens in a 
separate tab when you click the Home button. You can set the page or pages you want to 
use as the default home page in the Options dialog box, which you open by clicking the 
Firefox button, and then clicking Options. 
REFERENCE
Changing the Default Home Page in Firefox
• Click the Firefox button, click Options to open the Options dialog box, and then if 
necessary click the General icon in the Options dialog box.
• To use the current page, use a bookmarked page, or use the default Mozilla Firefox 
start page, click the corresponding button in the Startup section. If you have more 
than one tab open, the Use Current Pages button saves all the open pages as your 
start page.
• To specify a home page, type the URL of that Web page in the Home Page box. To 
open multiple home pages on separate tabs, type the URL for each home page sepa-
rated by commas in the Home Page box.
• Click the OK button.
You will use the Home button to return to your browser’s home page, and then you 
will view the home page settings.
To view the settings for your browser’s home page:

Using the Page Tabs
So far, all the Web pages you have visited have been displayed on the same tab. You can 
open additional page tabs on the tab strip next to the Firefox button, and load different 
Web pages on each tab instead of opening additional Web pages in separate browser 
windows. This tabbed browsing technique is especially useful when you need to open 
many pages or move frequently back and forth among multiple Web pages. 
There are several methods for opening a Web page in a new tab. You can click the 
Open a new tab button on the tab strip, and then open a Web page as usual. You can 
right-click a link on a Web page, and then click Open Link in New Tab on the shortcut 
menu. Or, you can press the Ctrl key as you click a link. To close a tab, you click the 
Close Tab button on that page tab. If you have only one tab open, you must exit Firefox 
to close that tab. Conversely, if you try to exit Firefox when you have more than one tab 
open, a dialog box opens, confirming that you want to close all of the open tabs.

You like the format of the Midland Pet Adoption Agency’s home page, so you want to 
make sure that you can go back to that page later if you need to review its contents. You 
can write down the URL so you can refer to it later, but Firefox makes it easier to return 
to previously visited Web pages using the Library.
Using the Library
The Library includes tools for managing and organizing a list of Web pages that you have 
visited so you can return to them easily. You open the Library by clicking the Bookmarks 
button on the Bookmarks toolbar or Navigation toolbar, and then clicking Show All 
Bookmarks; or by clicking the Firefox button, pointing to Bookmarks, and then click-
ing Show All Bookmarks. The Library tracks three items: History, Tags, and Bookmarks. 
A bookmark is a stored shortcut containing the URL of a Web page. A tag is a label or 
keyword you create to help you identify your bookmarks. History records your browsing 
activity by organizing and storing the URLs of the Web sites you have visited sorted in a 
variety of ways, including by date, name, visit count, location, and keyword. 
Creating and Organizing Bookmarks
As you use the Web to find information, you can create bookmarks so you can easily 
return to sites of interest. To create a bookmark, you navigate to the page you want to 
bookmark, and then you click the Bookmark this page button on the Location bar. You 
might very quickly find yourself creating so many bookmarks that it is difficult to find a 
specific bookmark. When you start accumulating bookmarks, it is helpful to keep them 
organized so that you can quickly locate the site you need. 
In the Library, you can add, delete, and organize bookmarks into folders that best 
suit your needs and working style. You can also create descriptive labels, called tags, 
and assign them to your bookmarks to help organize your bookmarks into categories. 
A bookmark can have more than one tag, and you can view the bookmarks associated

Saving Bookmarks
Once you have a collection of bookmarks, you might want to use them on other com-
puters in different locations. Firefox lets you save your bookmark file to a portable stor-
age device or network disk drive so you can do this. When you save Firefox bookmarks 
to a device or drive, all of the bookmarks are saved. You cannot save just one bookmark 
or only selected bookmarks. To save your bookmarks, click the Import and Backup but-
ton on the Library window toolbar, and then click Export Bookmarks to HTML to open 
the Export Bookmarks File dialog box. Navigate to the location where you want to save 
the bookmark file, type a name for the bookmark file in the File name box, and then 
click the Save button. To open the bookmark file from your portable storage device on 
another computer, open the Firefox Library window, click the Import and Backup button 
on the toolbar, click Import Bookmarks from HTML to open the Import Bookmarks File 
dialog box, locate and select your bookmarks file, and then click the Open button.
You realize that you will need to go to the Midland Pet Adoption Agency home page 
frequently. Although it’s easily available from the Library, it would be even faster to 
access that page from the Bookmarks toolbar. 
You’ll add the Midland Pet Adoption Agency’s URL as a link on the Bookmarks toolbar.
To add the Midland Pet Adoption Agency home page to the 
Bookmarks toolbar:
◗	
1.	 Click the Edit this bookmark button on the Location bar. The Edit This 
Bookmark window opens. 
Trouble?  If the Bookmarks toolbar doesn’t appear on your screen, right-click the 
blank area to the right of the page tabs, and then click Bookmarks Toolbar on the 
shortcut menu.
◗	
2.	 Click the Folder button, and then click Bookmarks Toolbar. The bookmark 
moves to the Bookmarks toolbar as a button labeled with the Web page’s title, as 
shown in Figure 1-27.

3.	 Click the Done button.

Deleting Bookmarks and Folders from the Library
Creating bookmarks is a great way to keep track of sites you know you want to visit on a 
regular basis. However, sometimes you no longer want to visit a site, such as when you 
saved favorites related to a specific project. Other times, the URL for a site has changed 
or the site no longer exists. In all these instances, you’ll want to delete the bookmarks 
and the folders in which they are stored. You can delete a specific bookmark, or you can 
delete a folder in the Library. When you delete a folder, the folder and all of its contents 
are moved to the Recycle Bin.
To delete the bookmark and folders you created:
◗	
1.	 Click the Edit this bookmark button on the Location bar. The Edit This 
Bookmark window opens. 
◗	
2.	 Click the Remove Bookmark button. The bookmark is deleted from Firefox, and 
the button disappears from the Bookmarks toolbar.
◗	
3.	 Click the Bookmarks button on the Bookmarks toolbar, and then click Unsorted 
Bookmarks. The Library window opens with the Unsorted Bookmarks folder 
selected in the left pane.
◗	
4.	 In the left pane, click Tags. As you can see, the three tags were also deleted 
when you deleted the bookmark.
◗	
5.	 In the left pane, click the Pet Adoption Agencies folder. The MN folder appears 
in the right pane.
◗	
6.	 Right-click the Pet Adoption Agencies folder in the left pane, and then click 
Delete on the shortcut menu. The folder and all of its contents are deleted from 
the Library.
◗	
7.	 Click the Close button on the Library window title bar to close the Library.
Navigating Web Pages Using the History List
Creating bookmarks is a great way to keep track of sites you know you want to visit on 
a regular basis. Another way to return to a site that you have visited recently is with the 
History list. The History list is useful when you know you visited a site recently, but you 
did not create a favorite and you cannot recall the URL of the site. You can see your 
recent browsing history by clicking the Firefox button, and then pointing to History to 
display a list of the last 15 Web pages that you visited on the History menu. You can see 
your complete History list by clicking the Firefox button and then clicking History to 
open the History list in the Library. From the History list, you can view a list of the sites 
that were visited on that computer during the last six months. You can display the history 
of visited sites organized by date, by site, by sites most visited, or by alphabetical order. 
You can also use the Search History box to search the History list for a specific site. To 
return to a specific Web page, just click its link in the History list.
You can also right-click a 
button on the Bookmarks 
toolbar, and then click 
Delete on the shortcut 
menu to remove the 
bookmark.

Not every site that you visit as you research pet adoption sites for the Danville Animal 
Shelter will warrant being saved as a bookmark. The History list will be helpful if you 
want to show Trinity the breadth of sites you visited during your research. You will view 
the History list next.
To view the History list for this session:
◗	
1.	 Click the Firefox button, and then point to History. A list of the last 15 Web 
pages you viewed appears on the History menu.
◗	
2.	 Click Show All History. The Library window opens with History selected in the 
left pane. The right pane displays folders that contain the browsing history orga-
nized by date, with the most recent folder first. Usually, the folders will include 
Today, Yesterday, Last 7 days, and a list of the most recent five months followed 
by an Older than 6 months folder. You can change the way pages are organized 
in the History list by clicking the Views button on the Library window toolbar, 
pointing to Sort, and then clicking an option. For example, you can list the pages 
alphabetically by Web page title or by location (which groups all Web pages by 
the Web server from which they originated). 
◗	
3.	 Double-click the Today folder in the right pane to open a list of Web sites visited 
most recently today in the order in which they were visited, including the Midland 
Pet Adoption Agency Web pages you visited in this session. Notice the home 
page for the site appears in the list more than once because you navigated back 
to that page from the other pages on the site. To return to a particular page, click 
that page’s entry in the list.
◗	
4.	 Click Midland Pet Adoption Agency. The Web page’s name, location, and tag 
information appear at the bottom of the Library window. See Figure 1-28.
If you are using a com-
puter in a computer lab 
or a public computer, the 
History list will include 
sites visited by anyone 
who has used the com-
puter, not just you.

Erasing Your Browsing History 
In some situations, such as when you are finishing a work session in a school computer 
lab or on any public computer, you might want to remove the list of Web sites that you 
visited from the History list of the computer on which you had been working. Erasing 
your browsing history helps protect your personal information and guard your privacy 
when working on a shared computer. You can delete your browsing history in Firefox by 
clicking the Firefox button, pointing to History, and then clicking Clear Recent History to 
open the Clear All History dialog box. You then click the Time range to clear arrow and 
select either a time range of browsing history to clear or Everything to clear the entire 
History list. If you select Everything, the dialog box will expand to show a list of items 
that will be deleted. Make sure the Browsing & Download History is the only check box 
selected in this list. If any other check boxes are selected, click each of them to clear the 
selections. After ensuring the Browsing & Download History is the only option checked, 
click the Clear Now button to erase the entire browsing history stored on the computer. 
Managing Cookies
All Web browser users should know about the use of cookies. A cookie is a small text 
file that a Web server saves on the hard drive of the computer that is running the Web 
browser software. A cookie is used to store information about your visit to a specific Web 
site, such as your login name and password, which pages you viewed, and your shop-
ping cart information. By storing this information on your computer, the Web server can 
retrieve the information when you return to that site, enabling it to perform functions 
such as automatic login, which makes it easier to sign in to Web pages you have visited 
before. However, the user often is unaware that cookie files are being written to the 
computer’s hard drive.
When the site you are visiting places a cookie on your computer, it is called a first-
party cookie. However, many cookies are written by companies that sell advertising on 
Web pages. The advertising elements of the Web page are delivered by the advertisers’ 
Web servers, not the Web server of the site you are visiting. These cookies record which 
ads have appeared on Web pages you have viewed. Advertisers use these cookies to 
determine which ads they will deliver the next time you open a Web page. This can be 
beneficial because it prevents sites from showing you the same ads over and over again. 
On the other hand, many people believe that this sort of user tracking is an offensive 
invasion of privacy. Cookies that are placed by companies other than the company 
whose Web site you are visiting are called third-party cookies.
Most Web browsers, including Firefox, allow you to block cookies from your com-
puter or to specify general categories of cookies (such as first-party or third-party) to 
block. In Firefox, you can specify privacy settings that control the writing of cookie files 
to your computer’s hard drive. You can specify which types of cookies to block or you 
can block particular types of cookies from specific sites. These options are available on

the Privacy panel in the Options dialog box. You will learn more about the different types 
of cookies, how they work, and how best to deal with them in Tutorial 6.
Firefox stores each cookie in a separate file. You can delete the cookies from your 
computer at any time or whenever you exit Firefox. To delete all of the cookies stored on 
your computer, click the Firefox button, click Options to open the Options dialog box, 
and then click the Privacy icon. You then can click the Show Cookies button to open the 
Cookies dialog box, and then click the Remove All Cookies button.
Because some cookies benefit users, you might not want to delete all of the cookies 
on your computer. For example, if you regularly visit a site that requires you to log in, 
the Web server can store your login information in a cookie on your computer so you do 
not have to type your user name each time you visit the site. You should always consider 
carefully whether the advantages of cookies outweigh the disadvantages for you before 
you delete all of your Firefox cookies.

Private Web Browsing
As you have learned, Firefox stores a considerable amount of information about your 
Web browsing activity. It stores a list of all the Web pages you have viewed in the 
History list, and it stores cookies that can contain information about your logins and 
passwords. It even stores information about which ads have been displayed on the Web 
pages you have viewed. 
Firefox also stores copies of all or part of the Web pages you visit on whatever com-
puter you are using. If you do not wish to have this information stored, you can use 
Firefox in Private Browsing mode. In Private Browsing mode, Firefox does not store your 
browsing history, cookies, or copies of the Web pages you visit. In other words, there 
is no record in Firefox of what sites you visited and what you looked at. When you are 
using a computer other than your own (such as a friend’s computer or a computer at 
work, school, or another public location), Private Browsing mode can help protect your 
privacy and security. 
To start a Private Browsing session, you click the Firefox button, and then click Start 
Private Browsing. The Private Browsing tab opens and displays a Private Browsing informa-
tion page to confirm that you are in Private Browsing mode. In addition, the Firefox button 
changes from orange to purple and remains that way until you end the Private Browsing

Stop Private Browsing to return to the Web page you were viewing before the Private 
Browsing session, or you can simply close the browser window to exit Firefox. 
As you visit Web pages in Private Browsing mode, the history list of the session, cook-
ies from that session, and temporary Internet files will be tracked only during the Private 
Browsing session. When you end the Private Browsing session, the history list, the cook-
ies, and temporary Internet files are removed from your computer.

Opening a Private Browsing Session
• Click the Firefox button, and then click Start Private Browsing on the menu.
• If the Start Private Browsing dialog box opens, click the Start Private Browsing button.
• Enter a URL in the Location bar to navigate to a Web site, and navigate to other Web 
pages by clicking links or opening Web pages on other tabs as usual.
• To end a Private Browsing session, click the Firefox button, and then click Stop Private 
Browsing; or click the Close button on the Firefox title bar to close the browser win-

If you examine the browser’s History, you will find that it includes no record of the 
Web pages you just visited. Although the browser does not record the pages you have 
visited (or other information, such as cookies), the network server that connects the 
computer to the Internet might have software that does. Therefore, it is best not to rely on 
Private Browsing mode to keep private the Web pages you visit while using a computer 
at work or another public location.

INSIGHT
Understanding Copyright for Web Page Content
A copyright is the legal right of the author or other owner of an original work to control 
the reproduction, distribution, and sale of that work. A copyright comes into existence 
as soon as the work is placed into a tangible form, such as a printed copy, an electronic 
file, or a Web page. Copyright laws can place significant restrictions on the way that you 
can use information or images that you copy from another entity’s Web site. Because 
of the way a Web browser works, it copies the HTML code as well as the graphics and 
media files to your computer before it can display them in the browser. Just because 
copies of these files are stored temporarily on your computer does not mean that you 
have the right to use them in any way other than having your computer display them in 
the browser window.
The United States and most other countries have copyright laws that govern the use 
of photocopies, audio or video recordings, and other reproductions of authors’ origi-
nal work. The copyright exists even if the work does not contain a copyright notice. If 
you do not know whether material that you find on the Web is copyrighted, the safest 
course of action is to assume that it is.
U.S. copyright law has a fair use provision that allows a limited amount of copy-
righted information to be used for purposes such as news reporting, research, and 
scholarship. The source of the material used should always be cited. Commercial use 
of copyrighted material is much more restricted. You should obtain permission from 
the copyright holder before using anything you copy from a Web page. The copyright 
holder can require you to pay a fee for permission to use the material from the Web 
page. The steps in this tutorial are designed so that your use of copyrighted Web pages 
and elements of those pages falls within the fair use provisions of U.S. copyright law.
Copying Text from a Web Page
You can also copy and paste portions of a Web page to a file or email. This can be help-
ful when you want to save specific information from a Web page, such as a schedule of 
events, directions to a location, or information about a place.

Printing a Web Page
Sometimes you will want to print a Web page. This might occur when you want to keep 
a printed page for reference, save a record or receipt of an online purchase, or have a 
coupon to use at a local store or restaurant. You access the Print commands by click-
ing the Firefox button and pointing to Print on the menu to open a submenu of printing 
options. Clicking Print opens the Print dialog box, which includes options for selecting a 
printer, setting a page range, and specifying the number of copies to print. 
You can also use the Page Setup dialog box to change aspects of a Web page print-
out, including the page orientation, print size, page background, margins, and headers 
and footers that print at the top and bottom of the page, respectively. The default header 
prints the Web page title in the left section, nothing in the center section, and the URL 
in the right section. The default footer prints the page number and the total number of 
pages in the left section, nothing in the center section, and the date in the right section. 
To open the Page Setup dialog box, click the Firefox button, point to Print, and then click 
Page Setup. 
Before printing a Web page, you should preview what the printout will look like to 
ensure that it will print in the best way possible. For example, you want to ensure that 
extra or unnecessary pages won’t print, that the printed page is legible, and that what 
will print is what you wanted to print. This extra step helps you to save resources, includ-
ing paper and printer ink. To open the Print Preview window, click the Firefox button, 
point to Print, and then click Print Preview. The Print Preview window shows how the 
current Web page will look on the printed page. It also provides access to common 
printing options. From the toolbar, you can open the Print dialog box, open the Page 
Setup dialog box, adjust the scale, and change the page orientation. Changing the scale 
enables you to shrink the Web page to fit better on the page or enlarge the Web page on 
the printout so it’s more legible. 
REFERENCE
Printing the Current Web Page
• Click the Firefox button, and then click Print to open the Print dialog box.
• In the Print dialog box, select the printer you want to use, indicate the pages you 
want to print, and choose the number of copies you want to make of each page.
• Click the OK button.
You will preview a copy of the Midland Pet Adoption Agency home page, and then 
print it. 
If you encounter a page 
that is difficult to print, 
be sure to look on the 
Web page for a link to a 
version of the page that is 
designed to be printed.

Review Assignments
There are no Data Files needed for the Review Assignments.
Trinity is pleased with the information you gathered so far about the Midland Pet 
Adoption Agency’s Web pages. In fact, she would like you to extend your research to 
other Web sites. She wants you to examine the Web sites of other charitable organiza-
tions that provide animal welfare services to their communities, and choose one site that 
would be a good example for the Danville Animal Shelter to follow as it updates its own 
Web site. She asks you to compile some information about the site you choose, includ-
ing some specific files, by completing the following steps, using either Internet Explorer 
or Firefox:
 1. Start your Web browser, and then enter the URL www.cengagebrain.com in your 
browser’s Address or Location bar. On the CengageBrain home page that opens, enter 
the ISBN number for this book in the Search box at the top of the page, and then 
click the Find button. (Hint: The ISBN for your book can be found above the bar code 
located in the lower-right corner of the back cover of your book. You can use either the 
ISBN-13 or ISBN-10 number to locate this book on CengageBrain.) On the Web page 
for this book, click the Access Now button to open the Book Companion page.
 2. Click the Weblinks link under the Book Resources heading, click the Download 
Now link for Tutorial 1, and then click the Review Assignments link.
 3. Click one of the links listed under the Review Assignments heading and explore 
the Web site. These Web sites belong to organizations that have goals and activi-
ties similar to those of the Danville Animal Shelter. The list includes more links 
than you will need; however, Web sites can change their URLs and the organiza-
tions that created them can even close. If a link you have chosen does not lead 
you to an active site, or if it leads you to a site that you believe is not relevant to 
this assignment, simply click another link. Explore at least three more Web sites, 
opening each site on a separate page tab.
 4. Choose one of the four sites that you think is well organized and has complete infor-
mation presented concisely. Save a copy of the home page of your chosen Web site 
with the filename Pet Home Page to the Tutorial.01\Review folder included with 
your Data Files in the HTML only format. 
 5. Create a favorite (if you are using Internet Explorer) or a bookmark (if you are using 
Firefox) for the Web page of your chosen site, and accept the default name for the 
favorite or bookmark. Store it in a new folder in the Favorites Center or Firefox 
Library named Pet Home Page.
 6. Using the links on the pages of your chosen site, navigate the site until you find a 
page that contains the organization’s address and contact information (telephone 
number, email address, or similar information). Preview and print the Web page.
 7. Navigate to a page that contains a photograph of a pet, and then save the photo-
graph with the filename Pet Picture in the Tutorial.01\Review folder.
 8. Navigate to a page that includes a statement about the site’s copyright or restrictions 
on use of its content. (Hint: You can search a Web page using either Internet Explorer 
or Firefox for specific text, such as “copyright” or “content,” by pressing the Ctrl + F 
keys to open the Find bar, typing the search text in the Find box that appears, and then 
clicking the Next button.) Copy and paste that text into a WordPad document and save 
it with the filename Pet Web Site Copyright Page in the Tutorial.01\Review folder.
 9. Use your browser’s Help system to find information on how cookies are tracked 
and managed in the browser. In a brief report to your instructor, summarize the 
Help information you find. Make sure your report identifies the title of the Help 
page you found, the definition of a cookie, the steps to view cookies if available, 
and the steps for deleting cookies.
Practice the skills 
you learned in 
the tutorial using 
the same case 
scenario.

Briar Lake Assisted Living Center  Nancy Francis is the events coordinator at Briar 
Lake Assisted Living Center. Recently, the center received a donation of five laptops and 
Nancy plans to make these available to residents. She knows that many of the residents 
are either new to computers or haven’t used them recently, so she is considering offer-
ing small group workshops on basic computer skills. She wants to set these computers 
up with the necessary software for residents to be able to send and receive email, write 
letters, and browse the Internet. To help Nancy decide which browser software to install 
on the computers, you will research and compare the features of the two most prevalent 
browsers: Internet Explorer and Firefox. Complete the following steps:

West Shore Community Center  Alex Jacoby is the youth coordinator at West Shore 
Community Center. Children come to the community center to play basketball, swim, 
learn crafts, and enjoy other activities. They can also use the community center’s com-
puter lab to complete school work and get help with assignments. Alex wants to update 
the Web browsers on the computers, and realizes that he can choose from a variety of 
browsers. To help Alex decide which browser or browsers to install, you will research 
and compare the features of two browsers. Complete the following steps:
 1. Start your Web browser, and then enter the URL www.cengagebrain.com in 
your browser’s Address or Location bar. On the CengageBrain home page that 
opens, enter the ISBN number for this book in the Search box at the top of the 
page, and then click the Find button. (Hint: The ISBN for your book can be found 
above the bar code located in the lower-right corner of the back cover of your 
book. You can use either the ISBN-13 or ISBN-10 number to locate this book on 
CengageBrain.) On the Web page for this book, click the Access Now button to 
open the Book Companion page.
 2. Click the Weblinks link under the Book Resources heading, click the Download 
Now link for Tutorial 1, and then click the Case Problem 5 link. 
 3. Click one of the links under the Case Problem 5 heading to open the product page 
for a Web browser. 
 4. Use the links and videos on the browser’s product page to familiarize yourself with 
the features and tools the browser offers. In your research, try to find answers to the 
following:
a. What features are available in the browser?
b. How are the tools and commands accessed in the browser?
c. Can you customize the browser window in any way?
d. Is there a way to keep track of your browsing activity, and if so, how?
e. Are there any privacy tools, and if so, how easy are they to manage?
f. Is there a search feature?
 5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for a second browser.
 6. In a report, compare and contrast the main features of the two browsers. Identify fea-
tures that might exist in one browser but not the other. If similar features exist in both 
browsers, assess whether you think one browser is easier or more difficult to use in 
that way. Conclude your report with a recommendation for Alex as to which browser 
you think might work best at West Shore Community Center.
 7. Close your browser. 
Identify other 
Web browsers 
that are available 
and describe 
their features.

Case	|	Kikukawa Air
Since 2001, Sharon and Don Kikukawa have operated a small hot 
air balloon service in Albuquerque, New Mexico. At first, Kikukawa 
Air employed only Sharon, who managed the office, reservations, 
and the company’s financial records, and her husband Don, who 
served as pilot for the couple’s brightly colored hot air balloon. After 
many successful years in business, Sharon and Don expanded their 
business to include longer scenic tours of the beautiful New Mexico 
mountains, special trips that feature meals or several balloons flying 
larger parties of clients to a specific destination, and participation 
in hot air balloon festivals and races. As a result of their expansion, 
Kikukawa Air now has 11 hot air balloons, 14 pilots, and a growing 
office staff of 10 people who coordinate reservations and accommo-
dations for their clients.
Although most employees already use email to communicate with 
each other and with clients and vendors, they are not all using the 
same email provider. In addition, employees are currently having 
problems sending and receiving messages on their mobile devices 
while working across the state of New Mexico. Sharon believes 
that Kikukawa Air could benefit from the company’s employees 
using the same email provider. This will make it easier to manage 
the accounts and troubleshoot connection problems on the mobile 
devices, and will streamline the company’s operations.
Sharon asks you to investigate a solution for her employees to use 
Web-based email accounts to exchange email messages, and to 
share business documents and other files on their computers and 
mobile devices.

Session 2.1 Visual Overview
Protocols are the rules that 
determine how message 
packets move over the 
Internet. SMTP (Simple Mail 
Transfer Protocol) handles 
a user’s outgoing mail and 
determines the paths an 
outgoing email message 
takes on the Internet.
The sender uses an email 
program on a computer or 
other device or a Web browser 
to enter the recipient’s email 
address, compose the email 
message, attach optional files, 
and send the message.
The sender’s local network 
sends the message to the 
sender’s mail server.
Messages are sent to a mail 
server, which is a hardware and 
software system that determines 
from the recipient’s address one 
of several electronic routes on 
which to send the message.

HOW EMAIL WORKS
POP (Post Office Protocol) 
handles a user’s incoming 
messages.
The email address in the 
message identifies the 
recipient’s mail server. 
The message is held on 
the recipient’s mail server 
until it is requested by the 
recipient’s device.
The recipient connects to 
his or her network to send 
a command to the mail 
server to download and 
view any new messages.
The recipient uses an 
email program on a 
computer or other device 
or a Web browser to read 
the message.

Internet | Tutorial 2 Basic Communication on the Internet: Email
What Is Email and How Does It Work?
Electronic mail, or email, is a form of communication in which electronic messages are 
created and transferred between two or more devices connected to a network. Email is 
one of the most popular forms of business communication, and for many people it is 
their primary use of the Internet. As shown in the Visual Overview for Session 2.1, email 
travels to its destination across the network to the recipient’s account on a mail server. 
For many personal and business reasons, people rely on email as an indispensable form 
of written communication.
Similar to how Web pages and files move across networks, email messages also use 
protocols that send and receive them on networks. The two most common protocols for 
sending and receiving email messages are POP and SMTP, which are both described in 
the Session 2.1 Visual Overview. Two additional protocols, IMAP and MIME, also handle 
email messages. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) retrieves mail messages 
from a remote server or messages stored on a large local network. MIME (Multipurpose 
Internet Mail Extensions) specifies how to encode nontext data, such as graphics and 
sound, so it can travel over the Internet.
When an email message arrives at its destination mail server, the mail server’s software 
handles the details of distributing the message locally, in the same way that a mailroom 
worker opens a mailbag and places letters and packages into individual mail slots. To 
check for new email messages, you use a program stored on your Internet device—
which might be a computer, cell phone, or other device, such as a tablet—to request 
the mail server to deliver any stored mail to your device. The software that requests mail 
delivery from the mail server to an Internet device is known as mail client software, or 
an email program.
An email address uniquely identifies an individual or organization that is connected 
to the Internet. To route an email message to an individual, you must identify that person 
by his or her account name, or user name, and also by the name of the mail server that 
manages email sent to the domain. The two parts of an email address—the user name 
and the domain name—are separated by an “at” sign (@). Sharon Kikukawa, for exam-
ple, selected the user name “Sharon” for her email account. Kikukawa Air purchased 
the domain name “KikukawaAir.com” to use both as its Internet address (URL) and in 
the email addresses for Kikukawa Air employees. Therefore, Sharon’s email address is 
Sharon@KikukawaAir.com.
A user name usually identifies one person’s email account on a mail server. When you 
are given an email address from an organization, such as your school or an employer, 
the organization might have standards for assigning user names. Some organizations 
set standards so user names consist of a person’s first initial followed by up to seven 
characters of the person’s last name. Other organizations assign user names that con-
tain a person’s first and last names separated by an underscore character (for example, 
Sharon_Kikukawa). When you are given the opportunity to select your own user name, 
you might use a nickname or some other name to identify yourself. On a mail server, all 
user names must be unique.
The domain name is the second part of an email address. The domain name specifies 
the name of the server to which the mail is to be delivered on the Internet, just like the 
domain name identifies the name of the computer on which a Web site resides. Domain 
names contain periods, which are usually pronounced “dot,” to divide the domain 
name. The most specific part of the domain name appears first in the address, followed 
by the top-level domain name. Kikukawa Air’s Web site address, KikukawaAir.com (and 
pronounced “Kikukawa Air dot com”), contains only two names separated by a period. 
The com in the domain name indicates that this company falls into the large, general 
class of commercial organizations. KikukawaAir indicates the domain name associated 
with the IP address for KikukawaAir.com.
Most organizations have a 
single mail server to man-
age the email they send 
and receive. Very large 
organizations might use 
multiple mail servers to 
manage their email.

Tutorial 2 Basic Communication on the Internet: Email | Internet
Most email addresses aren’t case-sensitive; the addresses sharon@kikukawaair.com 
and Sharon@KikukawaAir.com are the same. It is important for you to type a recipi-
ent’s address carefully; if you omit or mistype even one character, your message could 
be undeliverable or sent to the wrong recipient. When a message cannot be delivered, 
the receiving mail server might send the message back to you and indicate that the 
addressee is unknown. Sometimes mail that cannot be delivered is deleted on the receiv-
ing mail server without notifying the sender.
INSIGHT
Managing More than One Email Address
Keep in mind that an email account that was assigned to you by your school or 
employer is subject to the rules of use that the organization has established. Some 
schools and most employers have policies that dictate the permitted use of their 
equipment and email accounts. You should not use your employer’s email address for 
personal correspondence unless your employer specifies that your personal use of the 
email account and your workplace computer is acceptable. In some cases, an employer 
might terminate employees who abuse the company’s resources for personal use. In 
many cases, email is subject to monitoring by the organization, so messages you send 
with your organization-sponsored account are not guaranteed to be private.
For this reason, many people have more than one email address to manage their 
correspondence. It is very common for people to have a primary email address that they 
use for personal or business correspondence, and a secondary email address that they 
use for online subscriptions, online purchases, and mailing lists. If you are careful about 
how you distribute your primary email address, you might reduce the amount of unso-
licited mail that you receive. When your secondary email address starts getting a lot of 
unwanted messages, you can discard it and create a new one. If you keep track of who 
has your secondary email address, it will be easy to update your contacts if you need to 
change your secondary email address.
Common Features of an Email Message
An email message consists of three parts: the message header, the message body, and an 
optional signature. The message header contains information about the message, and the 
message body contains the actual message content. A signature might appear at the bot-
tom of an email message and contain standard information about the sender, which the 
recipient can use to contact the sender in a variety of ways.
Figure 2-1 shows a message that Don Kikukawa wrote to Jack Clancy, Margaret Durring, 
his pilots, and Sharon about an upcoming hot air balloon festival using an email program 
called Windows Live Mail, which you can download for free from the Windows Live Web 
site. The message contains an attached file named MealPlan.docx. Don created this file 
using Microsoft Word, saved it, and then attached it to the message. The primary features 
of this message are described in the next sections.

Internet | Tutorial 2 Basic Communication on the Internet: Email
To, Cc, and Bcc
You type the recipient’s full email address in the To line of a message header. You can 
send the same message to multiple recipients by typing a comma or semicolon between 
the recipients’ email addresses in the To line. If you have saved a recipient’s email 
address in your address book—the feature of an email program that stores informa-
tion about the people you exchange email with—the email program might display the 
address using the person’s name, as shown in Figure 2-1, instead of the recipient’s actual 
email address. The number of addresses you can type in the To line or in the other parts 
of the message header that require an address is not limited, but some mail servers 
will reject messages with too many recipients (usually 50 or more) as a way of control-
ling unsolicited mail. In Figure 2-1, Don used the To line to address his message to one 
recipient, Jack Clancy, whose email address was already stored in Don’s address book.
You can use the optional courtesy copy (Cc) and blind courtesy copy (Bcc) lines to 
send mail to people who should be aware of the email message, but are not the mes-
sage’s main recipients. When an email message is delivered, every recipient (including 
Bcc recipients) can see the addresses of other recipients listed in the To and Cc lines. 
Because Bcc addresses are excluded from messages sent to addresses in the To and Cc 
lines, neither the primary recipients (in the To line) nor the Cc recipients can view the 
list of Bcc recipients. Bcc recipients are unaware of other Bcc recipients, as well. For 
example, if you send a thank-you message to a salesperson for performing a task espe-
cially well, you might consider sending a blind courtesy copy to that person’s supervisor. 
That way, the supervisor knows a customer is happy and that the praise was unsolicited. 
In Figure 2-1, Don sent a courtesy copy of his email message to Margaret Durring and a 
blind courtesy copy to Sharon Kikukawa.
Sometimes an email address is not one person’s address, but rather a special address 
called a category (also called a group in some email programs). In a category, a single 
email address can represent several or many individual email addresses. For example,

Tutorial 2 Basic Communication on the Internet: Email | Internet
Don created a group named “Pilots” that includes the email addresses of the pilots who 
work for him so he can quickly address a new message to all pilots by typing the “Pilots” 
group name, instead of entering each pilot’s email address individually. In Figure 2-1, 
Don included the Pilots group in the Cc line of the email message, so each member of 
the Pilots group will receive a copy of the message.
From
The From line of an email message includes the sender’s name, the sender’s email 
address, or both. Most email programs automatically insert the sender’s name and email 
address in the From line of all outgoing messages. You usually do not see the From line 
in messages that you are composing, but you can see it in messages that you receive. 
Figure 2-1 does not show a From line because this is a message that Don is composing.
Subject
The content of the Subject line is very important. Often the recipient will scan an abbrevi-
ated display of incoming messages, looking for the most interesting or important message 
based on the content in the Subject line. If the Subject line is blank, then the recipient 
might not read the associated message immediately or at all. Including an appropri-
ate subject in your message helps the reader determine its content and importance. For 
example, a Subject line such as “Just checking” is less informative and less interesting 
than “Urgent: New staff meeting time.” The email message shown in Figure 2-1, for 
example, contains the subject “Meal for October 7 flight” and thus indicates that the mes-
sage concerns food for an upcoming trip.
Attachments
You can send only text messages using SMTP, the protocol that handles outgoing email. 
When you need to send a more complex document, such as a Word document, an Excel 
workbook, a picture, or a PDF file, you send it along as an attachment. An attachment 
provides a simple and convenient way of sending files to one or more people. An attach-
ment is encoded so that it can be carried safely over the Internet, to “tag along” with the 
message. Frequently, the attached file is the most important part of the email message, 
and the message body contains only a brief statement, such as “Here’s the file that you 
requested.” 
Don’s email message (see Figure 2-1) contains an attached file, whose filename 
and size in kilobytes appear in the message header. (A kilobyte (KB) is approximately 
1,000 characters.) You can attach more than one file to an email message; if you 
include multiple recipients in the To, Cc, and Bcc lines of the message header, each 
recipient will receive the message and the attached file(s). However, keep in mind that 
an email message with many attachments quickly becomes very large in size, and it 
will take longer for the recipients to download the message. In addition, some Internet 
service providers (ISPs) place limits on the size of messages that they will accept; in 
some cases, an email message with file attachments larger than 10 megabytes in size 
might be rejected and returned to the sender.
Email programs differ in how they handle and display attachments. Some email pro-
grams identify an attached file with an icon that represents a program associated with 
the attachment’s file type. In addition to an icon, some programs also display an attached 
file’s size and filename. Other email programs display an attached file in a preview win-
dow when they recognize the attached file’s format, and can start a program on the user’s 
device to open the file. Double-clicking an attached file usually opens the file using a 
program on the user’s device that is associated with the file type of the attachment. For 
example, if a workbook is attached to an email message, double-clicking the icon for 
the workbook attachment might start a spreadsheet program and open the workbook. 
Before sending a message 
with a large attachment, 
ask the recipient for the 
best way to send it.
Before opening an attach-
ment, be sure to scan it for 
viruses and other threats. 
You will learn more about 
detecting threats in this 
tutorial.

Internet | Tutorial 2 Basic Communication on the Internet: Email
Similarly, a Word document opens in the Word program window when you double-click 
the icon representing the attached document, as long as you have the Word program, or 
a program that can open Word documents, installed on your device.
Viewing an attachment by double-clicking it lets you open a read-only copy of the 
file, but it does not save the file on your device. (A read-only file is one that you can 
view but that you cannot change.) To save an attached file on your device, you need to 
perform a series of steps to save the file in a specific location, such as on a hard drive. 
Some programs refer to the process of saving an email attachment as detaching the file. 
When you detach a file, you must indicate where to save it. You won’t always need to 
detach an email attachment; if you simply keep the email message, you also keep a copy 
of the attachment for future use. You will learn how to attach and detach files later in this 
tutorial.
Message Body and Signature Files
Most often, people use email to write short, quick messages. However, email messages 
can be much longer. An email message is often less formal than a business letter that 
you might write, but it’s still important to follow the rules of formal letter writing when 
composing an email message. You should begin your messages with a salutation, such 
as “Dear Jack,” use proper spelling and grammar, and close your correspondence with a 
signature. After typing the content of your message—even a short message—you should 
check your spelling and grammar. You can sign a message by typing your name and other 
information at the end of each message you send, or you can create a signature file.
If you are using email for business communication, a signature file usually contains 
your name, your title, and your company’s name. Signature files might also contain a 
mailing address, telephone numbers, a Web site address, and a company’s logo. If you 
are using email for personal communication, signatures can be more informal. Informal 
signatures can include nicknames and graphics or quotations that express a more casual 
style found in correspondence between friends and acquaintances.
You can set your email account to insert a signature automatically into every message 
you send so you don’t have to type its contents. You can modify your signature easily or 
choose not to include it in selected messages. You can usually create multiple signature 
files so you can choose which one to include when sending a message.
When you create a signature, don’t overdo it: It is best to limit a signature to a few 
lines that identify ways to contact you. Figure 2-2 shows two examples of signatures. 
The first signature, which Don might use in his business correspondence to Kikukawa 
Air employees and friends, is informal. Don uses the second, more formal signature for 
all other business correspondence to identify his name, title, and contact information to 
make it easy for people to reach him.
Most mail servers do not 
allow you to retract mail 
after you send it, so you 
should proofread your 
messages carefully before 
sending them.

Internet Etiquette (Netiquette)
Netiquette, a term coined from the phrase “Internet etiquette,” is the set of commonly 
accepted rules that represent proper behavior on a network. Just as there are rules of 
proper conduct on networks that are owned or operated by schools and organizations, 
the Internet has its own set of acceptable rules. Unlike business networks on which 
administrators and webmasters set guidelines for acceptable use, and moderators are 
authorized to restrict usage of that network by users who don’t follow those rules, the 
Internet is self-policing. Email has its own set of rules, which have evolved over time and 
will continue to evolve as it gains new users.
Because it sometimes takes so little time and effort to compose an email message, you 
might be tempted to take some shortcuts in your writing, such as omitting the salutation 
and using acronyms for commonly used phrases, such as the ones shown in Figure 2-3. 
These shortcuts are fine for informal messages that you might send to your friends and 
family members, but they are not acceptable in business communication.

An email message is a business document, just like a memo or letter, and you should 
treat it with the same level of formality. Sending a message containing spelling and 
grammatical errors to a colleague or a potential employer is a poor reflection on you and 
your work. Many employers seeking to fill open positions automatically disregard email 
messages that do not contain a subject line or information in the message body describ-
ing the contents of the attachment and the applicant’s intention to apply for the position. 
In addition, some employers will not seriously consider applications that are sent with 
email messages that contain typos or demonstrate poor communication skills.
Because email can be an impersonal form of communication, some writers use 
emoticons to express emotion. An emoticon is a group of keyboard characters that when 
viewed together represent a human expression. For example, a smiley :-) looks like a 
smiling face when you turn your head to the left. Some writers use emoticons to show 
their readers a form of electronic body language. Figure 2-4 shows some commonly 
used emoticons that are used in email messages. The user can create these emoticons by 
using either typed characters or a feature of the email program that inserts an emoticon’s 
picture equivalent. Just like acronyms, emoticons are appropriate in informal correspon-
dence but not in business correspondence.

Some email programs let 
you insert emoticons as

keyboard combinations.

Written Communication: Generally Accepted Rules for Email Messages
When composing email messages, keep the following generally accepted rules in mind, 
especially for business correspondence:
• Avoid writing your messages in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU 
ARE SHOUTING.
• Keep your messages simple, short, and focused on their topics.
• Don’t use the “Reply All” feature when only the sender needs to know your response.
• Don’t assume that everyone you know likes to receive jokes or family pictures. Check 
with the recipients first.
• When sending messages to a large group, use the Bcc field for the recipients’ email 
addresses to protect their privacy and to prevent them from receiving additional 
responses from people who use the “Reply All” feature to respond.
• Include a descriptive subject in the Subject line and a signature, so the recipient knows 
the content of your message and how to get in touch with you.
• Use a spell checker, read your message, and correct any spelling or grammatical errors 
before sending it.
• Don’t overuse formatting and graphics, which can make your email message difficult 
to read. The fonts you select on your device might not be available on the recipient’s 
device and therefore the message might not display as you intended.
• Email is not private; don’t divulge private or sensitive information in an email message. 
It’s very easy for the recipient to forward your message to everyone he or she knows, 
even if it’s by accident.
• Use caution when attempting sarcasm or humor in your messages, as the recipient might 
not appreciate the attempt at humor and might actually misunderstand your intentions. 
Without the sender’s body language and tone of voice, some written statements are 
subject to misinterpretation.
• Use common courtesy, politeness, and respect in all of your written correspondence.
• When specifying a user name for your email address, select something that is appropri-
ate for both professional and personal correspondence, and that clearly identifies you to 
recipients.
Email Programs
Different software companies that produce Web browsers might also produce compan-
ion email programs that you can use to manage your email. For example, when you 
install Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows XP, the Outlook Express email program 
is also installed. Windows Vista and Windows 7 users might choose to install Windows 
Live Mail, and Mozilla Firefox users might choose to install the companion Thunderbird 
email program to manage their email messages. You can use these types of email pro-
grams to manage messages that are routed through a domain that sends email messages 
using the POP protocol. Messages that are routed through a domain in this way are 
called POP messages or POP3 messages because of the protocol used to send them. You 
might also have multiple email programs installed on your computer; in this case, the 
choice of which email program to use is up to you.
Before you can use an email program to send and receive your email messages, you 
must configure it to work with your email accounts. Before you decide which email 
program to use, you should be familiar with the different ones available. The Email 
Clients section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 2 includes links to some popular email 
programs, some of which are free. You can explore these links to learn more about these 
programs and their features. 
In Session 2.2, you will 
learn how to configure and 
use Windows Live Hotmail.

Common Features of Email Programs
Although there are many different ways to send and receive email messages, most email 
programs have common features for managing mail. Fortunately, once you learn the 
process for sending, receiving, and managing email with one program, it’s easy to use 
another program to accomplish the same tasks.
Sending Messages
After you finish addressing and composing a message, it might not be sent to the mail 
server immediately, depending on how the email program or service is configured. A 
message can be queued, or temporarily held with other messages, and then sent when 
you either exit the program, connect to your ISP or network, or check to see if you have 
received any new email. Most email programs and services include a “Drafts” folder in 
which you can store email messages that you are composing but that you aren’t ready to 
send yet. These messages are saved until you finish and send them.
Receiving and Storing Messages
When your mail server receives messages for your account, those messages are held on 
the mail server until you ask the server to retrieve your messages. Most email programs 
allow you to save delivered mail in any of several standard or custom mailboxes or 
folders on your Internet device. Once the mail is delivered to your device, one of two 
things can happen to it on the server: Either the server’s copy of your mail is deleted, or 
it is preserved and marked as delivered or read. Marking mail as delivered or read is the 
server’s way of distinguishing new mail from mail that you have read. For example, when 
Don receives mail on the Kikukawa Air mail server, he might decide to save his accumu-
lated mail on the server—even after he reads it—so he can access the messages again 
from another device. On the other hand, Don might want to delete old mail to save 
space on the mail server. Both methods have advantages. 
Saving old mail on the server lets you access your mail from any device that can con-
nect to your mail server. However, if you automatically delete mail after reading it, you 
don’t have to worry about storing and organizing messages that you don’t need, which 
requires less effort. Some ISPs and email providers impose limits on the amount of data 
you can store, so you must occasionally delete mail from your mailbox to avoid inter-
ruption of service. In some cases, once you exceed your storage space limit, you cannot 
receive any additional messages until you delete existing messages from the server, or the 
service deletes your messages without warning to free up space in your mailbox.
Printing a Message
Reading mail on a computer or other device is fine, but there are times when you will 
need to print some of your messages. Most email programs let you print a message you 
are composing or that you have received. The Print command usually appears on the File 
menu or as a Print button on the toolbar.
Organizing Messages
Most email programs let you create folders in which to store related messages in your 
mailbox. You can create new folders when needed, rename existing folders, or delete 
folders and their contents when you no longer need them. You can move mail from the 
incoming folder to any other folder to file it. Some programs let you define and use a 
filter or rule to move incoming mail into a specific folder, or to delete it automatically 
based on the content of the message. Filters are especially useful for moving messages 
from certain senders into designated folders, and for moving junk mail (or spam), which 
Filters aren’t perfect. When 
using filters to move mes-
sages to specific folders 
or to the trash, it’s a good 
idea to check your folders 
occasionally to make sure 
that your incoming mes-
sages are downloaded to 
the correct folder.

is unsolicited mail usually advertising or selling an item or service, to a trash folder. If 
your email program does not provide filters, you can filter the messages manually by 
reading them and moving them to the appropriate folders.
Forwarding a Message
You can forward messages that you receive to additional recipients. When you forward a 
message to another recipient, a copy of the original message is sent to the new recipient 
you specify without the original sender’s knowledge. You might forward a misdirected 
message to another recipient, or forward a message to someone who was not included in 
the original message routing list.
When you forward a message, your email address and name appear automatically in 
the From line; most email programs amend the Subject line with the text “Fw,” “Fwd,” or 
something similar to indicate that the message has been forwarded. You simply add the 
new recipient’s address to the To line and send the message. Depending on your email 
program and the preferences you set for forwarding messages, a forwarded message 
might be sent as an attached file or as quoted text. A quoted message is a copy of the 
sender’s original message with your inserted comments. A special mark (a > symbol or 
a solid vertical line) sometimes precedes each line of the quoted message. Figure 2-5 
shows a quoted message; the quoted message appears at the bottom of the message, and 
the “Fw:” text in the Subject line indicates a forwarded message.

WEB 86
Internet | Tutorial 2 Basic Communication on the Internet: Email
Replying to a Message
Replying to a message sends a response to a message you have received. Most email 
programs provide two options for replying to a message: You can reply to only the 
original sender using the Reply option, or you can reply to the original sender and all 
other To and Cc recipients of the original message by using the Reply All option. When 
you reply to a message that you received, the email program creates a new message 
and automatically addresses it either to the original sender (when you select the Reply 
option), or to the original sender and all of the original To and Cc recipients of the mes-
sage (when you select the Reply All option). Most email programs will add “Re:” to the 
beginning of the original subject text in the header and copy the contents of the origi-
nal message and place it in the message body of the reply. Like forwarded messages, a 
special mark might appear at the beginning of each line to indicate the content of the 
original message. When you are responding to more than one question, you might type 
your responses below the original questions so the recipient can better understand the 
context of your responses. When you respond to a message that was sent to several 
people, make sure that you select the correct option when replying.
Some email programs display replies to messages as conversations, or threads. When 
you receive an email message as part of a conversation, it appears in your Inbox on a 
single line, instead of as stacked individual messages on separate lines. In Figure 2-6, 
the first message in Don’s Inbox appears as a collapsed conversation, with a small 
arrow indicating that there are additional messages with the same subject line linked 
to the original message displayed in the Inbox. The second message in the Inbox is an 
expanded conversation; the selected message is displayed in the preview pane. If you 
reply to the original message as part of a thread, the reply is added to the conversation 
for the original message. As you send messages back and forth with the original sender, 
each subsequent reply from the original sender or from you is added to the conversation 
for the original message. Instead of needing to find and open multiple messages from 
different recipients, all of the messages related to a single original message appear in the 
conversation. To expand one of the previous replies, you click the sender’s name.

Tutorial 2 Basic Communication on the Internet: Email | Internet
Deleting a Message
Deleting a message is usually a two-step process. First, you temporarily delete a mes-
sage by placing it in a “trash” folder or by marking it for deletion. Then you permanently 
delete the trash or marked messages by emptying the trash folder or indicating to the 
email program to delete the messages. It is a good idea to delete mail you no longer 
need because it takes up a lot of space on the drive or server on which your email mes-
sages are stored.
Managing Your Contacts
You use a contact list to save email addresses and other optional contact information 
about the people and organizations with which you communicate. The features of a 
contact list vary by email program. Usually, you can organize information about indi-
viduals and groups. Each entry in the contact list can contain an individual’s full email 
address (or a group email address to represent several individual addresses), full name, 
and complete contact information. In addition, most email programs allow you to 
include notes for each contact. You can assign a unique nickname to each entry so it is 
easier to address your email messages. A nickname might be “Mom” for your mother or 
“Maintenance Department” to represent all the employees working in a certain part of 
an organization. Figure 2-7 shows the contact for Sharon Kikukawa in Don Kikukawa’s 
address book. Notice that there are other options for storing a contact’s personal, work, 
and other information.
After saving entries in the contact list, you can refer to them at any point while you 
are composing, replying to, or forwarding a message. You can review your contact list 
and sort the entries in many ways.
Some email programs 
use different names, such 
as contact manager or 
address book, when refer-
ring to the contact list.

Protecting Your Computer from Viruses
Email attachments, just like any other computer files, can contain malicious programs 
called viruses that can harm your computer and its files. Some users send attachments 
containing viruses without realizing that they are doing so; other users send viruses on 
purpose to infect as many computers as possible. If you receive an email message from 
a sender that you don’t recognize and the message contains an attached file, you should 
not open that file until you are sure that it doesn’t contain a virus.
People create viruses by coding programs that hide by attaching themselves to other 
programs on a computer. Some viruses simply display an annoying or silly message on 
your screen and then go away, whereas others can cause real harm by reformatting your 
hard drive, changing the file extensions and their associations, or sending a copy of the 
virus to everyone in your email program’s contact list. You must know how to detect and 
eradicate viruses if you plan to download anything, including data, programs, instant 
messages, or email attachments, from any Internet server.
Software that detects and eliminates viruses is called an antivirus program. The cat-
egory of software that detects viruses and other common security threats on the Internet 
is called Internet security software. This software usually includes tools that eradicate 
specific Internet threats, including viruses. Internet security software and antivirus pro-
grams start automatically when you start the computer, regularly scan the files on your 
computer and the files being downloaded to your computer, and compare them to a sig-
nature that known viruses carry. A virus signature (also called a virus pattern or a virus 
definition) is a sequence (string) of characters that is always present in a particular virus. 
An antivirus program can scan a single file or folder or your entire computer to search 
for infected files. When the antivirus program finds a virus signature, it might delete the 
file containing the virus or quarantine it and ask you how to proceed. Most antivirus 
programs can clean infected files by removing the virus. If your computer does not have 
an antivirus program or Internet security software installed on it, you can follow the links 
in the Virus Protection and Internet Security Software sections of the Weblinks page for 
Tutorial 2 to find resources on Internet security, viruses, and antivirus programs.
INSIGHT
Using Antivirus and Internet Security Software Effectively
Most computer manufacturers preload an antivirus program or Internet security suite 
on the system when you purchase it. Three popular choices for protecting computers 
are produced by Symantec (Norton), McAfee, and ZoneAlarm. These programs protect 
your computer from viruses, but only when they are turned on, are properly configured, 
and include current virus patterns and other program updates. When you first start the 
software, it will ask you to make a connection to its server, from which the program will 
download the most recent virus patterns and updates. You must regularly download 
updates from the server to keep your computer safe. Some programs include features 
that automatically download the patterns for you on a daily or weekly schedule; other 
programs require you to connect to the server and initiate the download. 
When you purchase and install a security program, you usually receive a free or 
prepaid trial subscription—usually up to 12 months—for downloading current updates. 
After this initial period ends, you must pay the software producer a fee to continue 
downloading updates. In either case, security software can protect you only from viruses 
and other security threats that it recognizes. If you install a program to protect your 
computer and do not regularly download updates, your computer won’t be protected 
from dozens of new threats that develop each month. In addition, if your software isn’t 
turned on or set to scan downloaded files, it cannot protect your computer.
And, finally, keep in mind that you usually have to open or execute a file to run any 
virus it contains. By regularly scanning your computer for viruses, downloading regular 
updates, configuring the program to work automatically, and scanning all downloaded 
files, you can protect your computer from viruses and other threats.
An antivirus program 
might be part of an 
Internet security suite that 
includes other programs 
that scan files for addi-
tional security threats and 
perform other tasks, such 
as blocking unwanted 
pop-up ads.

Dealing with Unsolicited Messages
Spam, also known as unsolicited commercial email (UCE) or junk mail, includes 
unwanted solicitations, advertisements, or chain letters sent to an email address. For 
most Internet users, spam represents waste in terms of the time it takes to download, 
manage, and delete. Besides wasting people’s time and their computers’ disk space, 
spam can consume large amounts of network capacity. If one person sends a useless 
email message to hundreds of thousands of people, that unsolicited message consumes 
Internet resources for a few moments that would otherwise be available to users with 
legitimate communication needs. 
Although spam has always been an annoyance, companies are increasingly finding 
it to be a major problem. In addition to consuming bandwidth on company networks 
and space on mail servers, spam distracts employees who are trying to do their jobs and 
requires them to spend time deleting unwanted messages. In addition, a considerable 
number of spam messages include content that is offensive or misleading to its recipi-
ents. According to the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG), approximately 
88% to 91% of all email messages sent every day are spam. In real numbers, this is bil-
lions of email messages a day.
One way to reduce spam in your Inbox is to control the exposure of your email 
address in places where spammers look for them. Spammers use software robots to 
search the Internet for character strings that include the “@” character that appears in 
every email address. These robots search Web pages, discussion groups, and other online 
sources that might contain email addresses. If you don’t provide your email address to 
these sources, you reduce the risk of a spammer getting it.
Some individuals use multiple email addresses to reduce spam. They use one address 
for display on a Web site, another to register for access to Web sites, another for shop-
ping accounts, and so on. If a spammer starts using one of these addresses, the indi-
vidual can stop using it and switch to another. Many Web hosting services include a 
large number of email addresses—often up to 10,000—as part of their service, so this is 
a good solution for people or small businesses with their own Web sites.
These strategies focus on limiting a spammer’s access to, or use of, an email address. 
Other approaches use one or more techniques that filter email messages based on 
their contents. Many corporate organizations fight spam aggressively by blocking it on 
the mail server and preventing it from being downloaded to individual user accounts. 
Individual users can also set filters that analyze the content in their incoming messages, 
and move spam messages to a trash folder or other folder when they are downloaded. 
From the perspective of a corporation, ISP, or other organization, it is more effective and 
less costly to eliminate spam before it reaches users. The problem with this approach, 
however, is that it is difficult for a filter to accurately differentiate “real” messages from 
spam. In many cases, legitimate messages are prevented from reaching the recipient 
when a spam filter misdirects the message.

Because spam continues to be a serious problem for all email users and provid-
ers, an increasing number of approaches have been devised or proposed to combat it. 
Figure 2-8 shows the home page from the Spam site, sponsored by the Federal Trade 
Commission, which gives advice to consumers and businesses about combating spam. 
Many U.S. jurisdictions have passed laws that provide penalties for sending spam. In 
January 2004, the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act (the law’s name is an acronym for “Controlling 
the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing”) went into effect. The CAN-
SPAM Act was the first U.S. federal government effort to legislate controls on spam. It 
regulates all email messages sent for the primary purpose of advertising or promoting a 
commercial product or service, including messages that promote the content displayed 
at a Web site.

The law’s main provisions are that unsolicited email messages must identify the 
sender, contain an accurate message subject and a notice that the message is an adver-
tisement or solicitation, make it possible for the recipient to “opt out” of future mailings 
within 10 days of receipt of the request, include the sender’s physical postal address, and 
prohibit the sender from selling or transferring an email address with an opt-out request 
to any other entity. Each violation of a provision of the law is subject to a fine of up to 
$16,000. Additional fines are assessed for those who violate one of these provisions 
and also harvest email addresses from Web sites, send messages to randomly generated 
addresses, use automated tools to register for email accounts that are subsequently used 
to send spam, and relay email messages through a computer or network without the 
permission of the computer’s or network’s owner.

Webmail Providers
In Session 2.1, you learned about the basic features of an email message, and the basic 
commands and features in most email programs. You can also obtain and use an email 
address from a Webmail provider to send and receive your messages. A Webmail pro-
vider is a Web site that provides a free email address and features to manage, send, and 
receive email messages. Most Webmail providers also offer other Web-based services, 
such as online file sharing, to registered users. An email account that you have with a 
Webmail provider is also called Webmail because you access the email account through 
the Webmail provider’s Web site. Two popular examples of Webmail providers are 
Windows Live Hotmail, which you’ll use in this session, and Google’s Gmail.
Most people who use Webmail providers have Internet access from their employer, 
school, public library, home provider, or cellular phone service provider. Many pub-
lic and school libraries provide free Internet access that you can use to access your 
Webmail account. This portability makes Webmail a valuable resource for people who 
travel or do not have a computer or other device on which to send and receive email.
You might wonder how these companies can provide free services such as Webmail—
after all, nothing is free. The answer is advertising. When you use a Webmail provider or 
any Web-based service, you might see advertising, such as a banner ad on the page or 
links to services sponsored by businesses that pay to display their information on your 
screen, or insert their information into the email messages you send from your Webmail 
account. Users must decide whether they are willing to endure this level of advertising in 
exchange for using the service. Most users of these free services agree that seeing some 
ads is a small price to pay for the convenience the free services provide.
INSIGHT
Targeted Advertisements in Webmail
Webmail providers, such as Microsoft and Google, are largely supported by adding 
advertisements to email messages based on message content and other information pro-
vided by the user. Ads are added to the user’s messages based on predefined keywords 
included in the messages. For example, when your email message includes a discussion 
about meeting friends for Chinese food later, ads for local Chinese restaurants—based 
on the zip code or other geographical information you provided when you created your 
account—might automatically appear in your message window. 
Although there is no human intervention to produce these advertisements, some 
users have concerns about the privacy of the email messages they receive because they 
are scanned and read by computers. Some people do not like the idea of seeing adver-
tisements based on the content of the messages they send and receive because they 
see it as an invasion of privacy. Gmail has made efforts to ensure that its advertising 
appears only as targeted text ads. This strategy is different from those of other Webmail 
providers that include untargeted advertising in the form of banners and pop-up win-
dows, which some users find to be more invasive. Just like any other free service, it is up 
to users to determine the level of advertising they are willing to endure in exchange for 
the free service provided.
To begin using any Webmail provider, you need to use your Web browser to connect 
to the Webmail provider’s Web site and create an account. In this session, you will cre-
ate a Windows Live ID, which also serves as your Windows Live Hotmail email address, 
so you can send and receive messages using Windows Live Hotmail.

Trouble?  The Create your Hotmail account page might change over time. If your 
page looks different, follow the on-screen instructions to create a Windows Live ID.
The first step in creating a Hotmail account is to create a Windows Live ID 
(Windows Live also calls this a sign-in name or a user name), which you will also 
use as your Windows Live Hotmail email address. A Windows Live ID can contain 
letters, numbers, or underscore characters ( _ ), but it cannot contain any spaces. 
After creating a Windows Live ID, you must create a password containing letters 
and/or numbers, but no spaces. You type your password twice to ensure that you 
entered it correctly. Finally, to help remember your password in the event that 
you forget it, you enter a question and its secret answer so Windows Live can 
verify your identity in the future, as necessary.
◗	
3.	 Click in the Hotmail address box, and then type a user name, which you will 
use as your Windows Live ID and your Windows Live Hotmail address. Your user 
name must be unique. You can try typing your first and last names, separated 
by an underscore character, followed by your birth date or year of birth, such 
as sharon_kikukawa0616. A Windows Live ID can contain only letters, numbers, 
periods, hyphens, and underscores.

4.	 If necessary, click the arrow on the box to the right of the Hotmail address box, 
and then click hotmail.com. (If the menu closes, click the arrow on the box to 
open the menu again.) 
◗	
5.	 Click in the Create a password box, and then type a password with at least six 
characters. The most effective passwords are ones that are not easily guessed and 
contain letters and numbers. As you type your password, dots or asterisks appear 
in the Create a password box to protect your password from being seen by other 
users. In addition, the Password strength indicator analyzes the password you 
typed to identify its strength. A weak password is one that contains only letters, 
such as “pencil.” A stronger password includes letters and numbers, such as  
“pencil87.” The strongest password is one that does not form a word and that 
includes mixed-case letters, numbers, and special characters, such as “p2nc1L%.”
◗	
6.	 Press the Tab key to move to the Retype password box, and then type your pass-
word again. Make sure to type the same password you typed in Step 5.
◗	
7.	 Click in the Alternate email address box. If you have an existing email address, 
enter it in the Alternate email address box. This is the email address that 
Windows Live will use to send you your password in case you forget it.
Trouble?  If you don’t have another email address, click the Or choose a security 
question for password reset link below the Alternate email address box, click 
the Question arrow that appears, select a question that you know the answer to, 
click in the Secret answer box, and then type the answer (using a minimum of five 
characters) to your question.
Now that you have entered a Windows Live ID and a password, you need to provide 
your account information.
To enter your account information:
◗	
1.	 Click in the First name box, type your first name, press the Tab key to move to 
the Last name box, and then type your last name. Your first and last names will 
appear in all email messages that you send.
◗	
2.	 If necessary, click the Country/region arrow, and then click the country or region 
where you live.
◗	
3.	 If necessary, click in the ZIP code (or Postal Code) box, and then type your zip 
code or postal code. Windows Live will use this information to provide you with 
additional services, such as local weather forecasts, that you might request in the 
future.
◗	
4.	 Click the appropriate option button in the Gender section to indicate your 
gender.
◗	
5.	 Click in the Birth date Month box, click your birth month in the list, click in the 
Birth date Day box, click your birth day from the list, click in the Birth date Year 
box, and then click the four-digit year of your birth.
The last part of creating a Windows Live ID is to verify that you are a person and not 
an automated program, and also to read and accept the agreements that govern the use 
of a Windows Live ID account.

To finish creating a Windows Live ID:
◗	
1.	 Scroll down the page as necessary so you see characters in a box. Many Web 
sites use a collection of characters, called a CAPTCHA and shown in Figure 2-11, 
as a way of verifying that a person is using the form to create an account instead 
of a computer. Created by professors at Carnegie Mellon University, CAPTCHA 
stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and 
Humans Apart.” 
Trouble?  If you can’t read the characters in the box, click the New link above the 
box to display a different collection of characters.
◗	
2.	 Click in the box, and then type the characters you see above it on the page. Be 
sure to type the characters shown on your screen; do not type the characters you 
see in Figure 2-11.
◗	
3.	 If you do not want to receive any emails with promotional offers, clear the check 
box that appears below the box in which you typed the characters.
◗	
4.	 Read the agreements, which appear as hyperlinks in the last paragraph on the 
page. After reading these agreements, click the I accept button. Your registration 
is complete when the page shown in Figure 2-12 (or a similar page) opens.

Trouble?  Windows Live might redesign its Web site, in which case your screen 
might not match the one shown in Figure 2-12.
Trouble?  After clicking the I accept button, a page similar to the one shown in 
Figure 2-13 will appear if the user name you selected is already in use. Select 
the text in the Hotmail address box, type a new user name, repeat Steps 1 and 
2, and then click the I accept button until you find a valid user name and see the 
page shown in Figure 2-12.
Now that you have created a Windows Live ID, Windows Live opens the Inbox for your 
Windows Live Hotmail address. So that you can practice signing in to your Windows Live 
account, you’ll sign out. Signing out closes your account and logs you out of the system. 
You should always sign out of your account when you have finished working so that other 
users cannot access your email or send messages using your email address.
To sign out of your account:
◗	
1.	 In the upper-right corner of the page and below your name, click the sign out 
link. The MSN home page (or another page) appears in your browser.
◗	
2.	 Return to the Weblinks page for Tutorial 2, and then click the Windows Live link. 
The Windows Live Sign In page opens.
Accessing Your Windows Live Account
Depending on your browser configuration, you might see your Windows Live Hotmail 
address in the Windows Live ID box on the Windows Live Sign In page. If you see your 
Windows Live Hotmail address, you can enter your password and then click the Sign in 
button to sign in to your Windows Live account. If you will be accessing your Windows 
Live account from your own computer, you might decide to click the Keep me signed in 
check box to select this option, so you won’t need to enter your login information in the 
future. This option presents a security risk because other users with access to your com-
puter can sign in to your account when they open the Windows Live Sign In page.
If you are having problems logging in to your account, you can enter your Windows 
Live ID and then click the Can’t access your account? link to identify the problem you’re

ing you to answer the question you specified when you created your account, or sending 
information or instructions for resetting your password to your alternate email address, if 
you specified one.
Next, you’ll sign in to your Windows Live account and open your Inbox.

click the Sign in button, and then, if necessary, click the Inbox link to open your 
Hotmail Inbox, as shown in Figure 2-14. If you just created your Hotmail account, 
you might see one new message from the Hotmail Team, welcoming you to the 
service. (You might see other messages, as well.) You also might see an advertise-
ment on the right side of the page.
Trouble?  If you receive a message that your Windows Live ID or password is not 
found, clear the Windows Live ID and Password boxes, and then reenter your 
information. If you are still having problems, click the Can’t access your account? 
link and follow the on-screen instructions. If you are still having problems, ask 
your instructor or technical support person for help.

Written Communication: Guidelines for Business Correspondence
Nearly all employees have some writing responsibility to communicate with colleagues, 
customers, and clients. Many corporate recruiters report that basic communication skills 
are one of the key items they assess when evaluating job candidates. A prospective 
employee’s first contact with a company is often written and includes a cover letter and 
a résumé, sometimes submitted as an email message. A person’s written communication 
skills are often a strong indicator of the type of employee that person might turn out to be.
Most busi ness professionals are busy and will only take time to read what is important 
and relevant to them at that point in time, especially when reading email. This means you 
must be succinct and to the point when composing email messages. When it comes to 
written precision, there are a few basic principles that will make your documents more pol-
ished. Because email messages are usually short and written quickly, it is easy to introduce 
grammatical mistakes that are more commonly found in oral communication, because the 
writer is “talking” while composing the message. The following guidelines will help you 
revise your messages to be grammatically correct:
• Avoid subject and verb disagreement. Pronouns must agree with the words they refer to 
in person, number, or gender.
• Don’t change verb tenses within a sentence, paragraph, or written composition. 
• Be sure to rewrite any run-on, incomplete, or unclear sentences.
Remember that the placement of commas, periods, apostrophes, and other punctuation 
marks can affect how the reader interprets your message. Before sending a message, verify 
that your punctuation is correct in the following situations:
• Use apostrophes to show possession (“The group’s decision is to promote Gretchen.”) or 
to indicate a contraction (“It’s the best restaurant in town.”).
• Do not use an apostrophe for plural nouns (DVDs, CDs), to reference a time period or num-
bers (the 1980s, “She is in her 20s.”), or with possessive pronouns (yours, ours, hers, its).
• Use a colon to introduce a list of items or an explanation (“Campers should bring the 
following items: flashlight, sleeping bag, insect repellent, and water bottle.”), in busi-
ness letter salutations (“Dear Mrs. Robinson:”), and to maximize the impact of a word or 
phrase that follows (“There is only one word to describe the event: magnificent.”).
• Use a comma to indicate a brief pause in a sentence, or to join or separate sentence 
parts. Use a comma before “and” in a list or series (“Steven, Hannah, and Annie went to 
the beach.”), between two or more adjectives that describe a noun (“Please bring a new, 
unused gift for the toy drive.”), to separate an introductory phrase or word (“However, 
the team won.”), to separate clauses that won’t change the meaning of a sentence if 
they are omitted (“The airport, which is located 30 miles south of town, has off-site 
parking.”), between names and titles or degrees (John F. Kennedy, Jr. or Susan Marino, 
Ph.D.), and inside a quotation mark in a sentence (“I’ll be there soon,” replied Juan.).
• Use a period in certain abbreviations (J.D., Jr., Mrs.) or to end a sentence. If a sentence 
ends with an abbreviation that ends in a period, no additional period is needed. When a 
sentence ends with a quote, the period goes inside the quotation mark.
• Use a semicolon to join independent, closely related thoughts (“My favorite activity is 
reading; I read at least three books a week.”).
You can learn more about business correspondence by following the links in the 
Business Writing section on the Weblinks page for Tutorial 2. 
Next, you will type, proofread, and send a brief message to Don.

attachments soon after receiving them so you do not inadvertently delete the messages 
containing them.
Replying to and Forwarding Messages
Replying to and forwarding messages are common tasks for email users. You can forward 
any message you receive to one or more email addresses. Similarly, you can respond to 
the sender of a message quickly and efficiently by replying to a message.
Replying to an Email Message
To reply to a message, click the Reply link on the Hotmail menu bar to reply only to the 
sender, or click the Reply all link on the Hotmail menu bar to reply to the sender and 
other people who received the original message (all email addresses listed in the To and 
Cc boxes). Windows Live Hotmail opens a reply message page and places the original 
sender’s address in the To box; other email addresses that received the original message 
appear in the To and Cc boxes as appropriate. You can leave the Subject box as is or 
modify it. Most programs, including Windows Live Hotmail, copy the original message 
and place it in the reply window. Figure 2-20 shows a reply to a message.

• Click the Send link on the Hotmail menu bar.
Forwarding an Email Message
When you forward a message, you are sending a copy of the message, including any 
attachments, to one or more recipients who were not included in the original message. (If 
you do not want to forward the original sender’s attached file to the new recipients, click 
the Close button next to the name of the attached file in the message header to remove it 
from the message.) To forward an existing mail message to another user, open the message 
you want to forward, and then click the Forward link on the Hotmail menu bar. A Forward 
message page opens, in which you can type the address of the recipient in the To box. 
If you want to forward the message to several people, type their addresses, separated by 
commas, in the To box (or Cc or Bcc boxes). Windows Live Hotmail includes the original 
message in the message display area and adds a blank line above it so you can add an 
optional message to provide context for the recipient. Figure 2-21 shows a forwarded copy 
of a message.

INSIGHT
Forwarding Messages Appropriately
When forwarding a message to a new recipient, and especially when forwarding a 
message that was forwarded originally to you, keep in mind that a forwarded message 
includes the email addresses of all the message’s previous recipients and senders. When 
you need to forward a message to a new recipient and it’s not important for the new 
recipient to know who sent you the original message, you can use the Copy and Paste 
commands in your email program to paste the content of the forwarded message into a 
new message, thus protecting the privacy of the message’s original recipients and mak-
ing the message easier to read for its new recipients.
Some people routinely send information about Internet viruses and hoaxes, or about 
emotional or charitable causes, such as cancer research, to everyone they know in an 
attempt to “spread the word.” Often, these messages contain incorrect information. 
Before being alarmed by information about viruses or hoaxes, contributing to any char-
ity that you learn about in this way, or forwarding the message to other users, be sure 
to check one of the many reputable Internet resources for more information. The Email 
Hoaxes and Rumors section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 2 contains links to sites 
that contain information about viruses, hoaxes, and fraudulent schemes.
Occasionally, Don receives messages he wants to keep for later reference. In 
Windows Live Hotmail, you can file email messages so you can refer to them later or 
print them as needed.
Filing and Printing an Email Message
You can use the Windows Live Hotmail folders to file your email messages by category. 
When you file a message, you move it from the Inbox to a folder. You will file your mes-
sage in a new folder named “Festivals” for safekeeping. 
To create the new folder:
◗	
1.	 Click the Inbox link, and then click the New folder link in the Folders list on 
the left side of the page. The New folder page opens, and the insertion point 
appears in the Folder name box. See Figure 2-22.

3.	 Click the Save link on the Hotmail menu bar. The page changes to show the list 
of folders and details about the folders’ contents. The Festivals folder appears in 
the list of folders.
After you create a folder, you can transfer messages to it. Besides transferring mes-
sages from the Inbox, you can select messages in any other folder and then transfer them

Inbox to the newly created Festivals folder.
To file a message in the Festivals folder:
◗	
1.	 Click the Inbox link.
◗	
2.	 Click the check box to the left of the Saturday’s festival timeline message to add 
a check mark to it.

then click Festivals in the list. The message is transferred to the Festivals folder.
◗	
4.	 Click the Festivals link in the Folders list on the left side of the page. The mes-
sage appears in the Festivals folder.
You might want to print certain messages for future reference. You can print a message 
at any time—when you receive it, before you send it, or after you file it. You will print the 
Saturday’s festival timeline message next.
To print the email message:
◗	
1.	 Click the subject for the Saturday’s festival timeline message to open it.
◗	
2.	 Click the Print button on the Hotmail menu bar. A new window opens and dis-
plays a “printer-friendly” version of the message, and the Print dialog box opens.

OK button). The message is printed.
◗	
4.	 Close the window with the printer-friendly version of the message, and then click 
the Inbox link.
When you no longer need a message, you can delete it.
Deleting a Message and a Folder
When you don’t need a message any longer, you can delete it by opening the message 
or selecting the message in the Inbox, and then clicking the Delete link on the Hotmail 
menu bar. You can delete a folder by selecting it and then clicking the Delete link on the 
Hotmail menu bar. When you delete a message or folder, you are simply moving it to the 
Deleted folder. The default setting for Windows Live Hotmail accounts is for the system 
to delete all messages in the Deleted folder periodically. However, if you want to remove 
items permanently, you can delete them from the Deleted folder.
A “printer-friendly” version 
of a message excludes ads 
and other content on the 
page, such as links.

Using SkyDrive to Share Files
In this session, you learned how to use email to send and receive messages with files 
attached to them. When you need to send multiple files or large files to other users, it 
is often impractical to attach them to an email message because your mail server or the 
recipient’s mail server might reject the message due to the number or size of its attach-
ments. In other cases, you might need to collaborate on a document, workbook, or other 
file with multiple users, or simply share the content of a document with multiple users. 
In these situations, you can use another Windows Live service, called SkyDrive, to post 
your files to a server and then use your Windows Live Hotmail account to share access 
to these files with users that you specify.
Sharon might want to post pictures of balloon races or tours using her Windows Live 
account, so she asks you to explore the options for posting photos on SkyDrive. 
To view the SkyDrive options for sharing photos:
◗	
1.	 At the top of the page, click the SkyDrive link. The SkyDrive page opens. 
◗	
2.	 Point to the SkyDrive link at the top of the page to open a menu. See Figure 2-26. 
The menu includes options for sharing existing files and photos with other users.  
You can also use the “New” links to create a new Word document, Excel work-
book, PowerPoint presentation, or OneNote notebook and store it in your 
SkyDrive account.

Estancia Ridge Estate  Bridget Estancia owns and operates the Estancia Ridge Estate, 
a small, private, family-owned olive grove specializing in locally grown olives that are 
pressed into olive oil on the premises. Bridget manages the gardens, the historic estate 
where she also lives, tours of the home and grove, and a gift shop. Olive oil sales are 
Bridget’s largest income item, but she has seen a rise in tourism over the past year at 
her unique estate. Because of this rise in tourism, Bridget is advertising in local tourism 
publications and other publications that might attract people to visit the estate. As part 
of the advertisements, she includes the estate’s phone number, its Web site address, and 
her email address. Although she receives many email messages from interested tourists, 
she has also started to receive many unsolicited messages as her email address is added 
to different mailing lists, some of which distribute information that she does not want to 
receive. Bridget asks you to research how she can use Windows Live Hotmail to manage 
the messages she receives by blocking senders from whom she does not want to receive 
messages, deleting junk mail, and filtering messages into categories or different views so 
she receives fewer messages in her Inbox. Complete the following steps:
 1. Start your Web browser, go to www.cengagebrain.com, open the Tutorial 2 Weblinks

Types of Search Questions
Searching the Web is a challenging task. No one knows exactly how many pages exist 
on the Web, but the number is now in the billions. Each of these pages might have thou-
sands of words, images, or links to downloadable files. Thus, the content of the Web is 
far greater than that of any library. Unlike the content of a library, however, the content 
of the Web is not indexed in any standardized way. So to successfully locate specific 
information for Dave and Ranjit, you will need to develop appropriate search strategies 
for their research questions. 
Dave and Ranjit will need different kinds of help because of their different writing 
goals. Dave will need quick answers to specific questions. Dave writes about busi-
ness opportunities and developments in almost every country in the world. His writing 
requires background research on most major businesses and industries. To support Dave, 
you need to be able to “get the facts” using the Web. For example, he might need to 
know the population of Bolivia or the languages spoken in Thailand. 
Ranjit writes longer, more thought-provoking pieces about broad economic and 
business issues. The Web is a good place to find unusual and interesting views on the 
economy and general business practices. Ranjit needs you to use the Web as a source for 
locating information on interesting concepts and new angles on old ideas, rather than as 
a place to find fast answers to specific questions. For example, he might need you to find 
Web sites that contain collections of research papers that discuss the causes of the Great 
Depression.
You can use the Web to obtain answers to both of these question types—Dave’s spe-
cific questions and Ranjit’s exploratory questions—but each requires a different search 
strategy. A specific question is a question that you can phrase easily and one for which 
you will recognize the answer when you find it. In contrast, an exploratory question 
is an open-ended question that can be harder to phrase; it is also difficult to determine 
when you find a good answer. 
Finding Answers to Specific Questions
The characteristics of a specific question are that the question can be answered with a 
single fact or set of information, and that the search for the answer involves a process of 
narrowing down the range of potential answers you examine in each step. Examples of 
specific questions include:
• Who was the prime minister of the United Kingdom during World War II?
• What is the second-highest mountain peak in the world?
• Who discovered radium?
• What is the chemical formula for table salt?
• In what year did Magellan circumnavigate the globe?
You will always know when you have completed the process of answering a specific ques-
tion because you have the answer or you have determined that the question cannot be 
answered. In some cases, your answer will not be in the form you expected. For example, 
in a search to answer the specific question “In what year did Magellan circumnavigate 
the globe?,” you might learn that Magellan’s circumnavigation took almost three years, 
from 1519 to 1522. You would also likely learn that Magellan was killed in the Philippine 
Islands, so he did not complete the circumnavigation personally; and that the purpose of 
the voyage was not to circumnavigate the globe, but to find a trading route to Asia.
When searching for the answer to a specific question, you need to start with broad 
categories of information and gradually narrow the search until you find the answer 
to your question. Figure 3-1 shows this process of sequential, increasingly focused 
questions.

As you narrow your search, you might find that you are heading in the wrong direc-
tion or down a blind alley. In that case, you need to get back on track by moving back 
inside the funnel defined by the two large red arrows shown in Figure 3-1. You can 
keep searching for increasingly narrow elements of information until you find the exact 
answer to your question. In the example shown, you might first find sources of popula-
tion statistics for the entire world, and then narrow your search to the specific continent 
(South America) and the specific country (Bolivia).
Finding Answers to Exploratory Questions
An exploratory question cannot be answered with a single fact or set of information. 
Examples of exploratory research questions include:
• What workplace conditions increase the risk of cancer?
• What is the best way to measure intelligence?
• Why did the Japanese maintain an isolationist policy in the 17th and 18th centuries?
• What are the safest and most effective ways to lose weight?
• How did jazz evolve as an American musical form?
An exploratory search starts with general questions that lead to other, less general ques-
tions. The answers to the questions at each level should lead you to more information 
about the topic in which you are interested. This information then leads you to more 
questions. Figure 3-2 shows how this questioning process leads to a broadening scope as 
you gather information pertinent to the exploratory question.

In Figure 3-2, you can see that a search for causes of the Great Depression resulted in 
five distinct facts or sets of information. Further research would tell you that the relative 
importance and validity of each of these causes is still debated by economists today. As 
you expand an exploratory search, you might find yourself collecting tangential (second-
ary or nonessential) information that is somewhat related to your topic but does not help 
answer your exploratory question. 
INSIGHT
Determining Useful Information
The boundary between useful and tangential information can be difficult to identify for 
exploratory search questions. Sometimes, what appears to be tangential information 
at first can later turn out to be useful information that leads you to expand your explor-
atory search in a fruitful direction. Do not be too quick to classify information as tangen-
tial. Remember, an exploratory search involves examining an increasingly wider range of 
information and identifying new insights in that information as you continue to search.

Formulating Effective Web Search Strategies
Once you have established the type of question you need to answer, you can implement 
an effective search strategy for finding the information you need.  
If your question is specific, the first step in your search strategy is to formulate and 
state your question. Next, you select the appropriate tool or tools to use in your search 
and translate your question into a search query that will work with your chosen search 
tool. (Web search tools will be discussed in the next section.) You then run the query 
and evaluate your results to determine whether they provide a specific answer to your 
question. If your results do not answer your question, you can continue the search by 
deciding whether a different search tool might produce useful results using your original 
question. If you do not believe a different search tool will help, you can revise and nar-
row your question and repeat the process.
If your question is exploratory, you begin your search strategy by formulating and 
stating questions that will yield information related to the area of your inquiry. Then you 
select appropriate search tools and translate each of your questions into search queries 
that will work in each search tool. After running the queries, you review your results and 
determine whether the information you have gathered is related to your question and 
whether you have collected sufficient information to answer your question. If not, you 
can formulate and state additional questions and repeat the process until you do have 
sufficient information to answer your original question.
Note that the first four steps are quite similar for both specific and exploratory ques-
tions, but the determination of when your search process is completed is different for the 
two types of questions. Figure 3-3 illustrates the search strategies for both types of ques-
tions so you can compare the processes used for each.

Tutorial 3 Searching the Web | Internet
An important part of any search is evaluating the quality of the search results you 
obtain. You will learn how to assess the validity and reliability of Web pages you find 
during your searches in the next session.
Web Search Tools 
To implement any Web search strategy, you will use one or more Web search tools. Web 
search tools include four broad categories of sites: search engines, directories, metasearch 
engines, and other Web resources such as Web bibliographies. The Additional Information 
section of the Tutorial 3 Weblinks page at www.cengagebrain.com includes links to many 
of these Web search tools. 
In this section, you will learn how to use each type of search tool. 
Understanding Search Engines
A Web search engine is a Web site (or part of a Web site) that finds other Web pages 
that match a word or phrase you enter into the search engine’s search page. This word or 
phrase is called a search expression or a query. A search expression or query might also 
include instructions that tell the search engine how to search; you will learn how to for-
mulate search expressions that include additional search instructions later in this tutorial. 
The basic search page for Bing, a popular search engine site, is shown in Figure 3-4.
Problem Solving: Repeating the Search Process
What happens if you conduct a Web search and you do not find an answer to your ques-
tion? You can repeat the search process as many times as necessary until you obtain either 
the specific answer you seek or a satisfactory range of information regarding your explor-
atory topic. Sometimes, you might find that the nature of your original question is different 
than you had originally thought. You also might find that you need to reformulate, or more 
clearly state, your question. As you restate your question, think of synonyms for each word. 
Unfortunately, many words in the English language have multiple meanings. For example, 
the word “mogul” can mean an influential businessperson, an Indian person of Mongolian 
or Persian descent, or a small bump in a ski run. If you use a word in your search that is 
common and has many meanings, you can be buried in irrelevant information or be led 
down many blind alleys. Identifying unique phrases that relate to your topic or question 
is a helpful way to avoid some of these problems. For example, if you are searching for 
sites that discuss ways to ski safely over a mogul, you could include the word “skiing” or 
“slope” in your search expression to reduce the chances of obtaining results that link to 
Web pages about Indian people or business magnatesds.

Tutorial 3 Searching the Web | Internet
When a user enters a search query into a search engine, the search engine does 
not search the Web to find a match; it searches only its own database of information 
about Web pages that it has collected, indexed, and stored. A search engine’s database 
includes the URL of the Web page (recall from Tutorial 1 that a Web page’s URL, or 
Uniform Resource Locator, is its Web address). The Session 3.1 Visual Overview shows 
how a search engine works. Most search engines use Web robots to build their databases 
of links to Web pages. A Web robot, also called a bot or a spider, is a program that 
automatically searches the Web to find new Web sites and update information about old 
Web sites that are already in the database. One of a Web robot’s more important tasks is 
to delete information in the database when a Web site no longer exists. The main advan-
tage of using an automated searching tool is that it can examine far more Web sites than 
an army of people ever could. However, the Web changes every day, and even the best 
search engine sites cannot keep their databases completely updated. 
People who create Web pages want their sites to be found by people who are inter-
ested in the content of those pages. Therefore, many search engines allow Web page 
creators to submit the URLs of their pages to the databases of search engines. This gives 
search engines another way to add Web pages to their databases. Most companies that 
operate search engines screen Web page submissions to prevent a Web page creator 
from submitting a large number of duplicate or similar Web pages. When the search 
engine receives a submission, it sends its Web robot out to visit the submitted URL and 
collect data about the site.
INSIGHT
Varying Results from Search Engines
If you enter the same search expression into different search engines, you will often 
get different results because each search engine has collected a different set of infor-
mation in its database, and each search engine uses different procedures to search 
its database. Some search engines do not collect their own information to build their 
databases. These search engines buy the right to use the database of another search 
engine. However, because each search engine uses different procedures to retrieve 
information from its database, a search engine that uses another search engine’s data-
base can still yield different results even though it uses the same database. 
After you enter your search query into the search page, the search engine returns a 
series of results pages. These are Web pages that list hyperlinks to the Web pages in 
the search engine’s database that contain text that matches your search expression. An 
example of a search results page (for a search on the word “car”) from the Google search 
engine appears in Figure 3-6.

WEB 143
Tutorial 3 Searching the Web | Internet
Most search engines report the number of hits they find on the results page. A hit is 
a Web page that is indexed in the search engine’s database, and that contains text that 
matches a specific search expression. When you click hyperlinks on a search engine 
results page, you might find that some of the Web pages no longer exist. A hyperlink to a 
Web page that no longer exists or has been moved to another URL is called a dead link. 
Web pages or Web sites that have a number of dead links are said to suffer from link rot.
The organizations that operate search engines often sell advertising space on the 
search engine Web page and on the results pages. An increasing number of search 
engine operators also sell paid placement rights on results pages. A paid placement is 
the right to have a link to your Web site appear on the search results page when a user 
enters a specific search term. For example, Toyota might want to purchase the right to 
have its site listed on the search results page whenever a user enters the search term 
“car.” When you enter a search expression that includes the word “car,” the search 
engine creates a results page that will have a link to Toyota’s Web site at or near the top 
of the results page. Most, but not all, search engines label these paid placement links as 
“sponsored,” and they are usually called sponsored links. Figure 3-6 shows sponsored 
links to advertisers that have paid for placement on this page. If the advertising appears 
in a box on the page (usually at the top, but sometimes along the side or at the bottom of 
the page), it is usually called a banner ad. Banner ads usually include pictures and other 
graphic elements in addition to the text of the ad.
Search engines use the revenue from sponsored links and banner ads to gener-
ate profit after covering the costs of maintaining the computer hardware and software 
required to search the Web, and the costs to create and search the database. The only 
price users pay for access to these useful search tools is being exposed to banner ads on 
the search results pages and having to scroll through a few sponsored links at the top of 
results pages.
Your first research assignment is to find the amount of average rainfall in Belize for 
Dave. This search question is a specific question, not an exploratory question, because 
you are looking for a fact and you will know when you have found that fact. You can use 
the process shown earlier in Figure 3-3 as follows:
• Formulate and state the question. In this case, the question can be formulated as 
“What is the average rainfall amount in Belize?”
• Because the question is very specific, you decide that a basic search engine would be 
a good tool to use.
• To translate the question into a search query, you can use the keywords “Belize,” 
“annual,” and “rainfall” from your question to create an appropriate search query. These 
terms should appear on any Web page that includes the answer to the question. The term 
“Belize” should be especially useful in narrowing the search to relevant Web pages.
• When you obtain the results, review and evaluate them, and then decide whether they 
provide an acceptable answer to your question.
• If the results do not answer the question to your satisfaction, you can redefine or refor-
mulate the question so it is more specific, and then conduct a second search using a 
different tool, question, or search expression until you find the fact you seek.

To find the average annual rainfall in Belize:
◗	
1.	 Start your Web browser, go to www.cengagebrain.com, open the Tutorial 3 
Weblinks page, and then click the Session 3.1 link.
◗	
2.	 Click a link to one of the search engines in the Basic Search Engines section to 
open that search engine’s Web site.
◗	
3.	 Type Belize annual rainfall in the search box.
◗	
4.	 Click the appropriate button to start the search. The search results appear on 
a new page. This page should indicate that there are hundreds, perhaps even 
thousands, of Web pages that might contain the answer to your question.
◗	
5.	 Scroll down the results page and examine your search results. Click some of the 
links until you find a page or several pages that provide annual rainfall infor-
mation for Belize. If you do not find any useful links on the first page of search 
results, click the link to view more search results pages (usually located at the 
bottom of the first results page).
◗	
6.	 Click your browser’s Back button to return to the results page. You should find 
that Belize has several climate zones and that the annual rainfall ranges from 60 
to 160 inches.
When you formulated and stated your question, you probably expected that you 
would find one rainfall amount that would be representative of the entire country; but 
that is not the case. Web searches often disclose information that helps you adjust the 
assumptions you made when you formulated the original research question.
Because you are fact-checking for a story that IER will publish, you will confirm what 
you have found by searching again using a different search engine. 
To conduct the same search to confirm your results:
◗	
1.	 Return to the Tutorial 3 Weblinks page, and then click a link to another of the 
search engines in the Basic Search Engines section.
◗	
2.	 Type Belize annual rainfall in the search box.
◗	
3.	 Click the appropriate button to start the search. You will most likely see a com-
pletely different set of links on your search results page.
◗	
4.	 Scroll down the results page and examine your search results, and then click 
some of the links until you find a page that provides the average annual rainfall 
for Belize. 
◗	
5.	 Return to the Tutorial 3 Weblinks page. Once again, you should find that  
Belize has several climate zones and that the annual rainfall ranges from 60 to 
160 inches, confirming the information you found in your first search. If this was 
not the case, you can conduct additional searches to determine the reason your 
answers are not consistent.
You might notice your second search returned a different set of links because each 
search engine includes different Web pages in its database, and because different search 
engines use different rules to evaluate search expressions. Some search engines will 
return hits for pages that include any of the words in the search expression. Other search

engines return hits only for pages that include all of the words in the search expression. 
You might also have noticed that many of the links on the results pages led to Web sites 
that have no information about Belize rainfall at all. This is why most researchers rou-
tinely use at least two search engines; answers that are difficult to find using one search 
engine are often easy to find with another.
The best way to determine how a specific search engine interprets search expressions 
is to read the Help pages on the search engine Web site. As you become an experienced 
Web searcher, you will find that you use two or three particular search engines for most 
of your work. Read the Help pages on those Web sites regularly because search engines 
do change the way they interpret search expressions from time to time. You should also 
get in the habit of checking other search engines occasionally because new search 
engines are launched and old search engines often make changes to stay competitive. 
Understanding Search Engine Databases
Search engine databases store different collections of information about the pages that 
exist on the Web at any given time. Many search engine robots do not search all of 
the Web pages at a particular site. Further, each search engine database uses its own 
approach to index the information it has collected from the Web. Some search engine 
robots collect information only from a Web page’s title, description, keywords, or HTML 
tags; others read only a certain number of words from each Web page. Figure 3-7 shows 
the first few lines of HTML from a Web page that contains information about develop-
ments in climate change research.
 
The description and keywords tags are examples of HTML meta tags. A meta tag is 
HTML code that a Web page creator places in the page header for the specific purpose 
of informing Web robots about the content of the page. Meta tags do not cause any text 
to appear on the page when a Web browser loads it; rather, they exist solely for the use 
of search engine robots.
The information contained in meta tags can become an important part of a search 
engine’s database. For example, the “keywords” meta tag shown in Figure 3-7 includes 
the phrase “climate change.” These keywords could be a very important phrase in a 
search engine’s database because the two individual words “climate” and “change” are 
common terms that often are used in search expressions that have nothing to do with 
climate change research. A search engine that includes the full phrase “climate change”

in its database will greatly increase the chances that a user interested in that topic will 
find this particular page.
Some search engines store the entire content of every Web page they index; but most 
search engines store only parts of Web pages. Search engines that store a Web page’s 
full content are called full text indexing engines. If you use a search engine that is not 
full text indexing, and the terms you use in your search expression are not in the part 
of the Web page that the search engine stores in its database, the search engine will 
not return a hit for that page. Many search engines, even those that claim to be full text 
indexed search engines, omit common words such as “and,” “the,” “it,” and “by” from 
their databases. These common words are called stop words. For example, if you enter 
a search expression of “Law and Order” (without the quotes) while looking for pages 
related to the television show of that name, a search engine that omits stop words will 
return a large number of irrelevant links because it will search on the two words “law” 
and “order.” Most search engines will include stop words if you include them as part of 
a phrase enclosed in quotes. You can find out how a particular search engine handles 
stop words by examining the search engine Web site’s Help pages; many search engines 
include information about their search engines, robots, and databases on their Help or

Page ranking is one technique that search engines use to find Web pages that might be 
relevant to a specific search expression. Page ranking is a way of grading Web pages 
by the number of other Web pages that link to them. The URLs of Web pages with high 
rankings are presented first on the search results page. A page that has more Web pages 
linking into it (these connections are called inbound links) is given a higher ranking than 
a page that has fewer pages linking into it. In complex page ranking schemes, the value 
of each link varies with the linking page’s rank.
For example, a Web page with many inbound links might have a lower ranking than 
another Web page that has fewer inbound links if the second page’s inbound links are 
from Web pages that, in turn, have a large number of inbound links themselves. As you 
can imagine, calculating page ranks can be complex; but the rankings can effectively 
identify pages that are likely to meet the needs of users. Although Google was the first 
search engine to use page ranking, and continues to lead in the development of highly 
sophisticated page ranking algorithms, most other search engines now use page ranking 
and are constantly working to refine the effectiveness of their algorithms.
Most search engines automatically use stemming to search for variants of keywords. 
For example, if you search using the keywords “Canada travel guide,” most search 
engines will return hits that include the keywords “Canadian” and “Canada” along with 
pages containing variants of the words “travel” and “guide.” Figure 3-8 shows how a 
search engine can use stemming to create multiple combinations of these terms and their 
variants to expand the results it will return for this query.

Another feature that some search engines have attempted to include in their pages is 
natural language querying. A natural language query interface allows users to enter a 
question exactly as they would ask a person that question. For example, using a natural 
language query, you might phrase the Belize rainfall search as “How much rain does 
Belize get each year?” You could ask the same question in various ways. The search 
engine analyzes the question using knowledge it has been given about the grammati-
cal structure of questions, and then uses that knowledge to convert the natural language 
question into a search query. This procedure of converting a natural language question 
into a search expression is called parsing.
Although no major search engine has yet been able to make a truly successful natu-
ral language query interface, the mathematical software company Wolfram has a Web 
site that offers a natural language interface to a database of collected facts. This site, 
Wolfram Alpha, lets users ask questions in natural language that relate to the facts in its 
database. You will use Wolfram Alpha to find out what the life expectancy is for people 
living in Belize.

To use the Wolfram Alpha natural language interface:
◗	
1.	 Return to the Tutorial 3 Weblinks page, and then in the Basic Search Engines  
section, click the Wolfram Alpha link to open the Wolfram Alpha search  
engine page.
◗	
2.	 Type what is the life expectancy in Belize in the box near the top of the page.
◗	
3.	 Click the Compute button to run the search. Instead of a results page listing 
links to Web sites related to your query, the site returns an actual answer to the 
question.
◗	
4.	 Examine the results and notice that, in addition to returning the answer  
as a value in years for the life expectancy in Belize, the site returns a good bit 
of information about the population of Belize and its characteristics. Although 
Wolfram Alpha is a search engine, it was built by a mathematics software com-
pany and advertises itself as being a computational engine, too. When you run 
a search with Wolfram Alpha, it will try to identify additional calculations that a 
person entering your search expression might want to perform. It performs those 
calculations and reports their results along with the search results.
Search engines provide a powerful tool for executing keyword searches of the Web, 
but they do have their limitations. Most search engine URL databases are built by com-
puters running programs that perform the search automatically, so they can miss impor-
tant classification details that a human searcher would notice instantly. For example, if a 
search engine’s robot found a Web page with the title “Test Data: Do Not Use,” it would 
probably not recognize the text as a warning and would include content from the page in 
the search engine database. If a person were to read such a warning in a Web page title, 
that person would know not to include the page’s contents. However, with billions of 
Web pages on the Internet today, it is impossible to have people screen every Web page.
Using Directories and Hybrid Search Engine Directories
Web directories use a completely different approach from search engines to build 
useful indexes of information on the Web. A Web directory is a listing of hyperlinks 
to Web pages that is organized into hierarchical categories. The difference between a 
search engine and a Web directory is that the Web pages included in a Web directory 
are selected and organized into categories before visitors use the directory. In a search 
engine, the database is searched in response to a visitor’s query, and results pages are 
created in response to each specific search. 
Most Web directories have human editors who decide which Web pages will be 
included in the directory and how they will be organized; however, some Web directo-
ries use computers to perform these tasks. Web directory editors, who are knowledge-
able experts in one or more subject areas and skilled in various classification techniques, 
review candidate Web pages for inclusion in the directory. When these experts decide 
that a Web page is worth listing in the directory, they determine the appropriate category 
in which to store the hyperlink to that page. 
The main weakness of a directory is that users must know which category is likely to 
yield the information they desire. If users begin searching in the wrong category, they 
might follow many hyperlinks before they realize that the information they seek is not 
in that category. Some directories overcome this limitation by including hyperlinks in 
category levels that link to lower levels in other categories.
Most Web directories 
allow a Web page to  
be indexed in several  
different categories.

One of the oldest and most respected directories on the Web is Yahoo! Directory. 
David Filo and Jerry Yang, two Stanford University doctoral students who wanted a 
way to keep track of interesting sites they found on the Web, started Yahoo! Directory 
in 1994. Yahoo! Directory currently lists hundreds of thousands of Web pages in its 
categories—a sizable collection, but only a small portion of the billions of pages on 
the Web. Although Yahoo! Directory does use some automated programs for checking 
and classifying its entries, it relies on human experts to do much of the selection and 
classification work. The Yahoo! Directory home page appears in Figure 3-9.

The search tool that appears near the top of the page is a search engine within Yahoo! 
Directory. You can enter search terms into this tool, and Yahoo! Directory will search its 
listings to find a match. This combination of search engine and directory is sometimes 
called a hybrid search engine directory; however, most directories today include a 
search engine function, so many people simply call these sites Web directories. No mat-
ter what it is called, the combination of search engine and directory provides a power-
ful and effective tool for searching the Web. Using a hybrid search engine directory can 
help you identify which category in the directory is likely to contain the information you 
need. After you select a category, the search engine is useful for narrowing a search even 
further; you can enter a search expression and limit the search to that category.
Yahoo! Directory includes 16 main categories, each with several subcategories. These 
are not the only subcategories; they are just a sample of those that are the largest or most 
used. You can click a main category hyperlink to see all of the subcategories under that 
category.
INSIGHT
Paying to Submit URLs to Web Directories
Many Web directories, including Yahoo! Directory, allow businesses that have Web sites 
to pay a fee and submit their URLs to the directory editors so they can consider includ-
ing the Web site in their directory. In most cases, the fee does not guarantee that the 
site will be included in the directory, but it does ensure that the editors know that the 
site exists. A new site on the Web that does not use a paid submission can wait months 
before a directory editor notices it and considers including it in a directory.
The Open Directory Project is different from most other Web directories because the 
editors volunteer their time to create the directory’s entries. The home page for the Open 
Directory Project is shown in Figure 3-10. The Open Directory Project uses the services 
of more than 40,000 volunteer editors who maintain listings in their individual areas 
of interest. The Open Directory Project offers the information in its Web directory to 
other Web directories and search engines at no charge. Many of the major Web direc-
tory, search engine, and metasearch engine sites regularly download and store the Open 
Directory Project’s information in their databases. For example, AltaVista, Dogpile, and 
Google all include Open Directory Project information in their databases.

Another Web directory, About.com, hires people with expertise in specific subject 
areas to create and manage its Web directory entries in those areas. Although both 
Yahoo! and Bing use subject matter experts this way, About.com takes the idea one step 
further and identifies its experts. Each About.com expert, called a Guide, hosts a page 
with hyperlinks to related Web pages, moderates discussion areas, and provides an 
online newsletter. This creates a community of interested persons from around the world 
that can participate in maintaining the Web directory.

Dave is working on an article about current trends in corporate governance. He 
knows that The Conference Board is an organization that conducts research on business 
issues related to governance. Dave would like you to give him a list of organizations 
similar to The Conference Board so he can do more extensive background reading before 
he writes the article. You will try to find The Conference Board in a Web directory to 
learn in what category the directory has placed it. Then, you can search the other listings 
in that category to find similar organizations.
To find organizations similar to The Conference Board using a Web 
directory:
◗	
1.	 Return to the Tutorial 3 Weblinks page, and then click a link in the Web 
Directories section to open a Web directory site.
◗	
2.	 In the search box near the top of the page, type The Conference Board, and 
then click the appropriate button to start the search. 
◗	
3.	 Examine the page that loads in your browser. In the text for the link to The 
Conference Board, the directory will include a link to the category (or categories) 
in which that directory has placed The Conference Board. 
◗	
4.	 Click a link to a category to open the category page and identify links to organi-
zations’ Web pages that might be helpful for Dave.
◗	
5.	 If you do not find links that might be helpful to Dave, you can search another 
category if one is listed. You can also search similar categories or try a different 
Web directory. Figure 3-11 shows the category in which The Conference Board 
is included in the Yahoo! Directory (Organizations within Business and Economy). 
This category includes links to several organizations’ Web sites that could be 
helpful to Dave.

Now that you have seen how to use a search engine and a hybrid search engine direc-
tory, you are ready to use an even more powerful combination of Web research tools: the 
metasearch engine.
Using Metasearch Engines
You have already seen how the differences in how search engines work cause the various 
search engines to return significantly different results for the same search expression. As 
stated previously, to perform a complete search for a particular question, you might need 
to use several individual search engines. A metasearch engine is a tool that combines the 
power of multiple search engines. Some metasearch tools also include directories. 
Using a metasearch engine lets you search several engines at the same time, so you 
need not conduct the same search multiple times. Metasearch engines do not have their 
own databases of Web information; instead, a metasearch engine transmits your search 
expression to several search engines. These search engines run the search expression 
against their databases of Web page information and return results to the metasearch 
engine. The metasearch engine then reports consolidated results from all of the search 
engines it queried.
Dogpile was one of the first metasearch engines on the Web. Dogpile forwards search 
queries to a number of major search engines and Web directories. The specific search 
engines and directories that Dogpile uses change from time to time because newer and 
better search tools become available and older tools disappear. Each item on the search 
results page is labeled to indicate the search engine or Web directory that found it. 
When more than one source provides the same result, that entry is labeled with all of the 
sources. Figure 3-12 shows the Dogpile metasearch engine home page.

You want to learn how to use metasearch engines so that you can access information 
faster. You decide to test a metasearch engine using Dave’s Belize rainfall question.
To use a metasearch engine:
◗	
1.	 Return to the Tutorial 3 Weblinks page, and then click a link in the Metasearch 
Engines section to open the Web site.
◗	
2.	 Type Belize annual rainfall in the search box, and then click the appropriate but-
ton to start the search.
◗	
3.	 Examine and evaluate your search results. If you did not find the information you 
were seeking, repeat your search using a different metasearch engine.
As with the other search tools, you will notice that the various metasearch engines 
can return differing results. 
Using Web Bibliographies
In addition to search engines, Web directories, and metasearch engines, the Web 
includes Web bibliographies, another category of search tools. As their name suggests, 
Web bibliographies are similar to print bibliographies; but instead of listing books or 
journal articles, they contain lists of hyperlinks to Web pages. Just as some bibliographies 
are annotated, many of these resources include summaries or reviews of Web pages. 
Web bibliographies are also called resource lists, subject guides, clearinghouses, and 
virtual libraries. Sometimes they are called Web directories, which can be somewhat 
confusing. Web bibliographies are usually more focused on specific subjects than Web 
directories, and Web bibliographies usually do not include a tool for searching within 
their categories.
Web bibliographies can be very useful when you want to obtain a broad overview or 
a basic understanding of a complex subject area. Using a search engine to locate broad 
information on a complex subject is likely to turn up a narrow list of references that 
are too detailed and that assume a great deal of prior knowledge. For example, using 
a search engine or directory to find information about quantum physics will probably 
give you many results that link to technical papers and Web pages devoted to current 
research issues in quantum physics. However, your search probably will yield very few 
Web pages that provide an introduction to the topic, and those few pages will be hard 
to find in the large number of Web pages that deal with advanced details of the subject. 
In contrast, a Web bibliography search results page can offer hyperlinks to information 
regarding a particular subject that is presented at various levels. Many of these resources 
include annotations and reviews of the sites they list. This information can help you 
identify Web pages that fit your level of knowledge or interest.
Some Web bibliographies, such as Awesome Library and the Librarian’s Internet Index, 
are general references. Most are more focused, such as Martindale’s The Reference Desk, 
which emphasizes science-related links. Some Web bibliographies, such as the Internet 
Scout Archive, are no longer actively updated, but they are maintained on the Web as 
useful information resources.
Many Web bibliographies are created by librarians at university and public libraries. 
You can find Web bibliographies on specific subjects by entering a search term along 
with the words “subject guide” into a search engine. The results of an example search 
on the words “Native American subject guide” conducted in the Google search engine 
appear in Figure 3-13.

Tutorial 3 Searching the Web | Internet
Another way to find Web bibliographies is to use a Web directory site. Many Web 
directories include links to subject-specific Web bibliographies within the category 
listings for those subjects. For example, the Yahoo! Web directory includes a link titled 
“Web Directories” within its Social Science category. This link leads to a list of Web bib-
liographies on the subject of social science. It also has similar links in many of the social 
science subcategories, such as Economics. Other Web directories include similar links.
Ranjit is planning a series of articles on the business and economic effects of current 
trends in biotechnology, including information about the potential effects of genetic 
engineering research. You need to find some Web sites that Ranjit can use to learn more 
about biotechnology trends in general and genetic engineering research in particular. An 
exploratory search will locate the required information, and you can use a Web bibliog-
raphy site for your research. Biotechnology is a branch of the biological sciences, so you 
will use the three category terms “biotechnology,” “genetic engineering,” and “biology” 
as your search terms. 
To use a Web bibliography to conduct an exploratory search:
◗	
1.	 Return to the Tutorial 3 Weblinks page, choose one of the sites in the Web 
Bibliographies section, and then click a link in the Web Bibliographies section to 
open a Web bibliography’s Web site. The home page for most Web bibliography 
sites provides a search box and a list of subject categories you can choose from to 
narrow your search.
◗	
2.	 Use the search tool in the Web bibliography you chose to find links to general 
information about biotechnology, genetic engineering, or biology. Follow those 
links to gather information relative to your search. 
◗	
3.	 Examine your search results and determine whether you have gathered sufficient 
useful information to provide to Ranjit. If you have not, repeat the search using a 
different Web bibliography.
◗	
4.	 Close your browser.
You have completed your research for Dave and Ranjit using various search tools to 
obtain different results. In the next session, you will learn how to structure your search 
queries to achieve more precise results using Boolean logic and filtering techniques.

Using Logical Operators and Filtering 
Techniques in Complex Searches
The most important factor in obtaining good results from a search engine, a metasearch 
engine, or a search tool within a hybrid search engine directory is careful selection of the 
search terms you use. When the object of your search is straightforward, you can usually 
choose one or two words that will work well. More complex search questions require 
more complex queries, which you can use along with Boolean logic, search expression 
operators, wildcard operators, or filtering techniques, to broaden or narrow your search 
expression. 
INSIGHT
Searching Library Databases
The Boolean operators and filtering techniques you will learn to use in this session can 
also be helpful when you are doing searches in library databases. These databases, 
which can be very expensive to purchase, provide much information that cannot be 
found on the Internet and are often available at school libraries, company libraries, or 
your local public libraries. Each database has its own implementation of Boolean opera-
tors and filtering tools, but the principles you learn here will help you in formulating 
your searches of these library databases. 
When you enter a single word into a Web search tool, it searches for matches to that 
word. When you enter a search expression that includes more than one word, the search 
tool makes assumptions about the words that you enter. You learned in Session 3.1 that 
some search engines assume that you want to match any of the keywords in your search 
expression, whereas other search engines assume that you want to match all of the 
keywords. These alternative assumptions can result in dramatic differences in the num-
ber and quality of hits returned. Some search engines are designed to offer both options 
because users might want to match all of the keywords in one search and any of the 
keywords in a different search. One way of implementing these options is to use logical 
operators in the search expression.
Logical Operators
Logical operators specify the relationship between the elements they join, just as the 
plus sign in arithmetic specifies the mathematical relationship between the two ele-
ments it joins. The most commonly used logical operators in complex Web searching are 
Boolean operators, named for George Boole, a nineteenth-century British mathemati-
cian who developed a system of logic called Boolean algebra. Boolean algebra allows 
two values, usually true and false. Although Boole did his work a hundred years before 
computers became commonplace, his algebra is still useful to computer engineers and 
programmers. Unlike the algebra you might have learned in your math classes, Boolean 
algebra does not use numbers or arithmetic operators. Instead, Boolean algebra uses 
words and logical relationships.
Three basic Boolean operators—AND, OR, and NOT—are recognized by most search 
engines. You can use these operators in many search engines by simply including them 
with search terms. For example, the search expression “exports AND France” returns hits 
for pages that contain both the words “exports” and “France.” The expression “exports 
OR France” returns hits for pages that contain either word, and “exports NOT France” 
returns hits for pages that contain the word “export” but not the word “France.” 
Some search engines use 
“AND NOT” to indi-
cate the Boolean NOT 
operator.

WEB 161
Tutorial 3 Searching the Web | Internet
Some search engines recognize variants of the Boolean operators, such as “must 
include” and “must exclude” operators. For example, a search engine that uses the 
plus sign to indicate “must include” and the minus sign to indicate “must exclude” 
would respond to the expression “exports + France - Japan” with hits that include 
pages with the words “exports” and “France” but only if those pages did not also 
include the word “Japan.”
Figure 3-14 shows several ways to use Boolean operators in more complex search 
expressions that contain the words “exports,” “France,” and “Japan.” The figure shows 
the matches that a search engine will return if it interprets the Boolean operators cor-
rectly. Figure 3-14 also describes information-gathering tasks in which you might use 
these expressions.

Other Search Expression Operators
When you are creating a search query that combines three or more search terms with 
Boolean operators, the complexity of the query can make it hard to construct properly. 
One way to simplify the process is to use precedence operators along with the Boolean 
operators. A precedence operator, also called an inclusion operator or a grouping 
operator, establishes specific grouping levels within a complex expression and is usu-
ally indicated by the parentheses symbols. You might have used precedence operators 
(parentheses) in your math or algebra classes in a similar manner to group mathematical 
expressions. Logical precedence operators work the same way. They establish grouping 
levels within which the Boolean operators function.
For example, the Boolean search expression “red AND green OR blue” would return 
results that include red and green along with all results that include blue. Using prece-
dence operators could change the outcome of that search. For example, the expression 
“red AND (green OR blue)” would return any results that include red and either green or 
blue. Figure 3-15 shows several ways to use precedence operators with Boolean opera-
tors in search expressions.

Some search engines use double quotation marks to indicate precedence group-
ing; however, most search engines use double quotation marks to indicate search terms 
that must be matched exactly as they appear within the double quotation marks. Using 
an exact match search phrase can be particularly useful because most search engines 
ignore stop words by default. You can force most search engines to include a stop word 
(that they would, by default, otherwise ignore) in a search expression by enclosing it in 
double quotation marks (or by including it in an exact search phrase that is enclosed 
in double quotation marks). This technique can be especially helpful when searching a 
specific topic that includes several stop words. For example, if you were searching for 
information about J.D. Salinger’s novel, The Catcher in the Rye, and used those words in 
your search expression, most search engines would ignore the three stop words included 
in the title and would search for pages containing “Catcher” and “Rye” only. By using 
the double quotes to force the search engine to include the stop words, “The Catcher in 
the Rye,” you would be more likely to see search results in which you were interested.
Another useful search expression operator is the location operator. A location  
operator, or proximity operator, lets you search for terms that appear close to each 
other in the text of a Web page. The most common location operator offered in Web 
search engines is the NEAR operator. If you are interested in French exports, you might 
want to find only Web pages in which the terms “exports” and “France” are close to 
each other; for example, “exports NEAR France.” Unfortunately, each search engine 
that implements this operator uses its own definition of “NEAR.” One search engine 
might define NEAR to mean “within 10 words,” whereas another search engine might 
define NEAR to mean “within 20 words.” To use the NEAR operator effectively, you 
must read the search engine’s Help pages to determine its definition of NEAR.
Wildcard Characters
Some search engines support the use of a wildcard character in their search expres-
sions. A wildcard character allows you to omit part of a search term. The search engines 
that include this function most commonly use the asterisk (*) as the wildcard character. 
For example, the search expression “export*” would return pages containing the terms 
“exports,” “exporter,” “exporters,” and “exporting” in many search engines. 
As you learned earlier in this tutorial, many search engines automatically use stem-
ming to search for additional word endings. Using the search term “import” in one of 
those search engines is exactly the same as using a wildcard character at the end of the

search term (“import*”) in a search engine that supports wildcard characters. However, 
a search engine that uses wildcard characters is more flexible than one that uses simple 
stemming because the wildcard character can be inserted in the middle or at the begin-
ning of the search term, as well as at the end. For example, the expression “wom*n” 
would return pages containing both “woman” and “women.”
Search Filters
Many search engines allow you to restrict your search by using search filters. A search 
filter eliminates Web pages from search results. The filter criteria can include such Web 
page attributes as language, date, domain, host, or page component (URL, hyperlink, 
image tag, or title tag). For example, many search engines provide a way to search for the 
term “exports” in Web page titles and ignore pages in which the term appears in other 
parts of the page.
Performing Complex Searches
Most search engines implement many of the operators and filtering techniques you have 
learned about in this session. The way in which various search engines apply these tech-
niques can differ; some search engines provide separate advanced search pages for these 
techniques, while others allow you to use advanced techniques such as Boolean opera-
tors on their simple search pages. When formulating a strategy for a complex search, 
it is important for you to understand the operators and filtering options available in the 
search engine you are using, so you can use these tools most effectively to formulate and 
run your search query.
This section describes how to conduct complex searches in several specific search 
engines. The steps are correct as this book is printed, but the Web changes constantly. 
When you perform these steps, the screens you see might look different and you might 
need to modify the steps. If you encounter difficulties, ask your instructor for assistance 
or read the Help pages on the search engine site. If major changes occur, the Tutorial 3 
Weblinks page at www.cengagebrain.com will be updated to indicate how to make the 
searches work.
Using Exalead to Perform a Boolean Search
Ranjit is writing about the role that trade agreements play in limiting the flow of agricul-
tural commodities between countries. His current project concerns the German econ-
omy. Your job is to find some Web page references that might provide useful background 
information. Ranjit is especially interested in learning more about the German perspec-
tive on trade issues.
This is an exploratory question. You can use the Boolean search capabilities of the 
Exalead search engine to conduct a complex search for Web pages. Exalead is a search 
engine that allows the use of several Boolean and precedence operators.
To create an effective search expression, you must identify search terms that might 
lead you to appropriate Web pages. Some terms you might use for the search are 
“Germany,” “trade,” “treaty,” and “agriculture.” You want to locate a reasonable number 
of hyperlinks to Web pages, but you do not want to search through thousands of URLs, 
so you will combine the search terms using Boolean logic to increase the chances that 
the search engine will return only useful sites. You want your search results to include 
only Web pages that have the words “Germany” and “trade,” along with either of the 
words “treaty” or “agriculture.” Figure 3-16 shows how to use the Boolean operators 
AND and OR, combined with parentheses as precedence operators, to formulate an 
appropriate search query.

Dave is writing an item about Finland and would like to interview a professor he once 
met who taught graduate business students there. He does not remember the professor’s 
name or the name of the university at which the professor teaches, but he does remem-
ber that the professor taught business subjects at a university in Finland. Dave is confi-
dent that he would recognize the university’s name if he saw it again. He asks if you can 
search the Web to find the names of some Finnish universities.
You will use the Google search engine for this task. To create a useful search expres-
sion, you must identify search terms that might lead you to appropriate Web pages. In 
this case, you will include “Finland” as a search term. Also, Dave told you that graduate 
schools of business in Europe are often called Schools of Economics, so you will include 
the exact phrase “School of Economics” in your search. The country code for Finland is 
“.fi,” so you will limit the search to Web pages in this top-level domain using the Google 
filter options. Because Dave reads English only, you also will filter the search to return 
pages that are in English.

Using Search Engines with Clustering Features
You have seen how Boolean operators and filters can help target the search to return 
pages that will more likely meet your needs. However, these pages might still number 
in the tens of thousands (or even millions). Scrolling through hundreds of results pages 
looking for useful resources is not very efficient. Some search engines group their search 
results into clusters. The clustering of results is similar to a filtering effect; however, the 
filtering is done automatically by the search engine after it runs the search. Another 
difference is that none of the search results are discarded; they are simply sorted into 
multiple categories, or clusters. Clustering can be especially effective when a word in 
the search expression has multiple meanings. For example, the word “java” can mean 
the name of an island, the name of a programming language, or a slang term for coffee. 
Clustered results place each of these meanings in separate categories.
Search engines that include a clustering feature use one of two strategies to implement 
clustering. One approach is to create categories as the search engine database is built. 
Each Web page that is stored in the database is placed into one or more categories. A sec-
ond approach creates the categories after the search expression is run against the database. 
The search engine constructs the categories on the fly and uses information about all the 
words in the search expression (and their relations to each other and keywords in the Web 
pages selected). For example, the Yippy search engine collects search results into clusters 
and runs the clustering algorithms as the search results are returned. That is, instead of clas-
sifying Web pages into categories in its database, it creates the categories dynamically after 
it processes the search expression. Yippy defines its clusters using artificial intelligence. The 
clustering is done in real time for each search and depends on the search expression and 
the clustering algorithm, which is continually revised. 
Ranjit is writing about fast-food franchises in various developing countries. He needs 
information on this industry’s experience in Indonesia. You can run this search using a 
search engine with a clustering feature such as Yippy. As you know, to create a useful 
search expression, you must identify search terms that might lead you to appropriate 
Web pages. Some terms you might use include “Indonesia,” “fast food,” and “franchise.” 
You are not interested in Web pages that contain the individual terms “fast” and “food,” 
so you will use double quotation marks to specify the phrase “fast food.” The Yippy 
search engine uses its clustering feature as a substitute for Boolean logic, so you will 
enter a simple expression and let it filter your results into searchable categories.
To obtain clustered search results using Yippy:
◗	
1.	 Return to the Tutorial 3 Weblinks page, and then click the Yippy link in the 
Search Engines with Clustering Features section.
◗	
2.	 Click in the Search box if necessary, and then type Indonesia “fast food”  
franchise. Make sure that you type the quotation marks so that you find the 
phrase “fast food” instead of the individual terms “fast” and “food.”

3.	 Click the Search button to start the search. Figure 3-19 shows the search results 
page, which includes links to a number of promising Web pages.

Exploring the Deep Web
Many different companies and organizations are working on ways to make searching 
the Web easier and more successful for the increasing numbers of people who use the 
Web. One weakness of most current search engines and Web directories is that they 
only search static Web pages. A static Web page is an HTML file that exists on a Web 
server computer. The robots used by search engines to build their databases can find and 
examine these files.
An increasing number of Web sites do not store information as HTML files. Instead, 
they store information in a database; and when a user submits a query using the search 
tools on the site, the site’s Web server searches the database and generates a Web page 
on the fly that includes information from the database. These generated Web pages are 
called dynamic Web pages. For example, if you visit Amazon.com and search for books 
about birds, the Amazon.com Web server queries a database that contains information 
about books and generates a dynamic Web page that includes that information. This 
Web page is not stored permanently on the Web server and cannot be found or exam-
ined by search engine robots. Much of the information stored in these databases can 
only be accessed by users who have a login and password to the Web site that generates 
dynamic pages from the database.
Several researchers have explored the difficulties that search engine robots face when 
trying to include information contained in the databases that some Web sites use to gen-
erate their dynamic pages. Some researchers call this information the deep Web; other 
researchers use the terms hidden Web and invisible Web. Many of these researchers are 
working at universities and research institutes. One team working at the University of 
Utah has created an experimental Web site that allows visitors to search the deep Web. 
The home page of this site, called DeepPeep, is shown in Figure 3-20.

Evaluating Web Research Resources
One of the most important issues in conducting research on the Web is assessing the 
validity and quality of the information provided on the Internet. Because the Web has 
made publishing information so easy and inexpensive, virtually anybody can create a 
Web page on almost any subject. Research published in scientific or literary journals is 
subjected to peer review. Similarly, books and research monographs are often reviewed 
by peers or edited by experts in the appropriate subject area. However, information on 
the Web is seldom subjected to the review and editing processes that have become a 
standard practice in print publishing.
When you search the Web for entertainment or general information, you most likely 
will not suffer significant ramifications from gathering inaccurate or unreliable informa-
tion. When you are searching the Web for an answer to a serious research question, 
however, the risks of obtaining and relying on inaccurate or unreliable information can 
be significant.
You can reduce your risks by evaluating carefully the quality of any Web resource on 
which you plan to rely for information related to an important judgment or decision. To 
develop an opinion about the quality of the resource, you can evaluate four elements 
of any Web page: the Web page’s authorship, ownership, content, and appearance. The 
Session 3.2 Visual Overview summarizes the process for effectively evaluating Web pages.

WEB 171
Tutorial 3 Searching the Web | Internet
Authorship, Expertise, and Objectivity
The first step in evaluating a Web research resource is to determine who authored the 
page. If you cannot easily find authorship information on a Web site, you should ques-
tion the validity of the information included on the site. A Web site that does not identify 
its author has very little credibility as a research resource. Any Web page that presents 
empirical research results, logical arguments, theories, or other information that purports 
to be the result of a research process should identify the author and present the author’s 
background information and credentials so you can evaluate the author’s expertise. 
The information on the site should be sufficient to establish the author’s professional 
qualifications.
You can also check secondary sources for corroborating information. For example, 
if the author of a Web page indicates that he or she is a member of a university faculty, 
you can find the university’s Web site and confirm that the author is listed as a faculty 
member. The Web site should also provide author contact information, such as a street 
address, email address, or telephone number, so that you can contact the author or con-
sult information directories to verify the addresses or telephone numbers. This allows you 
to determine that the author is an actual person, and is the person depicted as the author 
of the Web site content.
You also should consider whether the qualifications presented by the author pertain to 
the material that appears on the Web site. For example, the author of a Web site con-
cerned with gene-splicing technology might list a Ph.D. degree as a credential. However, 
if the author’s Ph.D. is in history, it would not suggest sufficient expertise to support the 
credibility of the gene-splicing technology Web site. If you cannot determine the specific 
areas of the author’s educational background from the Web site itself, you can look for 
other examples of the author’s work on the Web. By searching for the author’s name and 
terms related to the subject area, you should be able to find other sites that include the 
author’s work. The fact that a Web site author has written extensively on a subject can 
provide some evidence—although not necessarily conclusive evidence—that the author 
has expertise in the field.
In addition to identifying the author’s identity and qualifications, author information 
should include details about the author’s affiliations—either as an employee, owner, 
or consultant—with organizations that might have an interest in the research results or 
other information included in the Web site. Information about the author’s affiliations 
will help you determine the level of independence and objectivity that the author has 
with respect to the topics presented on the Web site. For example, research results sup-
porting the contention that cigarette smoke is not harmful presented in a site authored 
by a researcher with excellent scientific credentials might be less compelling if you learn 
that the researcher is the chief scientist at a major tobacco company. By reading the page 
content carefully, you might be able to identify a potential bias in the author.
Web Site Ownership and Objectivity
The author of a Web page is seldom the owner of the Web site. In some cases, it can be 
difficult to determine who owns a specific Web site. Most Web sites include information 
about ownership on their About pages; however, some sites do not. In some cases, the 
owner might be an organization with an intentionally misleading name.
You can make a rough assessment of what type of entity a Web site’s owner is by 
examining the domain identifier in the URL. If the site claims affiliation with an educa-
tional institution, the domain should be .edu. A not-for-profit organization would most 
likely have the .org domain, and a government unit or agency would have the .gov 
domain. These are not hard-and-fast rules, however. For example, some perfectly legiti-
mate not-for-profit organizations have URLs with a .com domain.

WEB 172
Internet | Tutorial 3 Searching the Web
Once you have determined who or what entity owns the Web site, you can assess 
whether they are likely to have a bias regarding the content of the site. A for-profit com-
pany, for example, would be unlikely to provide unbiased evaluations of products or 
services provided by their competitors.
Accuracy, Relevance, Scope, and Objectivity of Content
When evaluating the actual content on the Web page, you want to assess its accuracy, its 
relevance to your research question, the depth of the topic’s coverage, and the objectiv-
ity of the material’s presentation. 
When considering accuracy, you might first determine the timeliness of the content. 
If the material was not published recently, the information might no longer be accurate. 
Check the Web page for a clearly stated publication date or updated date. You can also 
search other Web sites to confirm that factual information presented is similar to fac-
tual information presented on these other sites. However, this does not guarantee that 
the information is correct because it is possible for a number of sites to have incorrect 
information.
The relevance of a site’s content to your research question can be more difficult to 
judge; after all, people often search the Web to learn about topics with which they are 
not familiar. However, some characteristics of the content on a Web page can help you 
determine whether that content will help you answer your research question. 
You can read the content with a critical eye and evaluate whether the included topics 
are relevant to your research question. You might be able to evaluate the scope of the 
site by determining whether important topics or considerations are omitted from the sites 
content. You can do this by comparing the content to what you find on other Web pages 
devoted to the topic. Comparisons to other Web pages can help you assess the depth of 
treatment the author gives to the subject. 
Finally, to ensure you are getting complete information on your topic, you will want 
to confirm the Web page content’s objectivity—in other words, whether it acknowledges 
its own bias. Some Web pages present a balance of viewpoints, but many are created for 
the specific purpose of supporting a particular position. This is especially true if the issue 
is contentious. The best Web sites with information on contentious issues always make 
clear which side they are taking in the argument and show respect for the position taken 
by the other side.
Form and Appearance
A Web site that is a legitimate source of accurate information usually presents its infor-
mation in a professional form that helps convey its validity. Many Web pages that 
contain low-quality or incorrect information are poorly designed and not well edited. 
For example, a Web page devoted to an analysis of Shakespeare’s plays that contains

spelling errors is likely to be a low-quality resource. Loud colors, graphics that serve no 
purpose, and flashing text are all Web page design elements that often indicate that the 
Web page is a low-quality resource. However, these indicators are not infallible. The 
Web does contain pages full of misinformation and outright lies that are nicely laid out, 
include professionally produced graphics, and have grammatically correct and properly 
spelled text.
Evaluating the Quality of a Web Page
Now that you understand the principles of assessing Web page quality, you will apply 
these principles as you analyze a Web page. 
REFERENCE
Evaluating a Web Page
• Open the Web page in your Web browser.
• Identify the author, if possible. If you can identify the author, evaluate his or her  
credentials and objectivity.
• Examine the content of the Web site for accuracy, relevance, scope, and objectivity.
• Evaluate the site’s form and appearance to determine quality and appropriateness.
• Draw a conclusion about the site’s overall quality.

You can see that the author of the page is Jakob Nielsen and that the page has a 
clear, simple design. You note that the grammar and spelling are correct and the 
content is neither inflammatory nor overly argumentative, although it does reflect 
a strong specific viewpoint on the issue. The date on which the page was pub-
lished is clearly stated at the top of the page. You note that this page appears to 
be part of a Web publication called “Alertbox” by looking at the page’s URL and 
by noting the link at the top of the page.
◗	
2.	 Click the Alertbox link near the top of the Web page to learn more about the 
Web publication.
You see that the full title of the publication is “Alertbox: Current Issues in Web 
Usability” and that it is written by Dr. Jakob Nielsen, a principal of the Nielsen 
Norman Group. You can also see that the site offers a free email newsletter, 
and that it has a clearly stated privacy policy that governs the use of any email 
addresses submitted. Although some sites state policies that they do not follow, 
the existence of a clearly stated policy is a good indicator of a high-quality site.
◗	
3.	 Click the Jakob Nielsen link that appears under the publication title near the  
top of the page to open a biography page on which you can learn more about 
Dr. Nielsen. 
◗	
4.	 Click your browser’s Back button to return to the Alertbox page, and then click 
the Nielsen Norman Group link to open the Nielsen Norman Group information 
page. Reviewing the information on these pages helps you to evaluate the qual-
ity of the Children’s Websites page.

Websites page is of high quality. Dr. Nielsen and his organization are both well 
respected in the field of Web site usability research. If you would like to do an additional 
exploration regarding this topic, you could use your favorite search engine to conduct 
searches on combinations of terms such as “Nielsen” and “Web usability.” 
Evaluating Wikipedia Resources
Wikipedia is a Web site that hosts a community-edited set of online encyclopedias in 
more than a dozen different languages. The concept behind Wikipedia is similar to that 
behind the Open Directory Project you learned about in Session 3.1. Instead of hiring 
experts to review and edit entries, which is what all print encyclopedias do, Wikipedia 
relies on contributions from anyone for its entries. Those entries then can be edited by 
anyone who reads them and thinks they should be changed in some way. The idea is that 
with enough people reading, editing, and re-editing the entries, the information on the 
site will evolve to a higher degree of accuracy.
Some of the articles on Wikipedia are well written, authoritatively referenced, and 
show the benefit of the multiple reviews by qualified volunteer editors. Other articles, 
especially those about subjects that are not of interest to a large number of readers, 
are written by authors of questionable qualifications and have not been edited at all. 
Although unsourced material can be challenged and ultimately removed, this does not 
occur unless someone who is interested in the topic takes the time and effort to chal-
lenge the material. A large number of Wikipedia articles include a dated disclaimer 
stating that they need additional citations or verification. In many cases, the disclaimer 
is several years old. Figure 3-22 shows parts of the Wikipedia article on internal rate of 
return, a topic in corporate finance.

As you can see, the article includes a disclaimer at the top noting that it needs addi-
tional citations. The article does provide a few citations (near the bottom of the page) 
and includes a reference for readers who want to learn more about the topic. However, 
most people who wanted to learn how to compute the internal rate of return in a specific 
context would find this article hard to read and incomplete.
The end result of Wikipedia’s open nature is that it contains a great deal of useful 
information, and much of that information is valid. However, Wikipedia’s content is only 
as good as its contributors; and consequently, some of the information on the site is inac-
curate, incomplete, or biased.
One of the most important tools you can use to assess the quality of information on 
the Web is the author’s identity. On Wikipedia, contributors may post and edit articles 
anonymously, in which case the author is identified only by the IP address of his or her 
connection to the Internet. Even when the author or editor of an article chooses to be 
identified, it is through a Wikipedia account name and the biographical information 
included on the user page is entered by the account holder. That information can be 
limited or incorrect if the account holder so chooses.
Written Communication: Using Wikipedia in Web Research
Some researchers have found Wikipedia to be a useful tool for doing preliminary back-
ground reading when they are investigating a subject that is new to them. They find that 
Wikipedia can often give them a general introduction to the subject that they can use to 
search intelligently for authoritative materials relevant to their information search. However, 
few researchers would rely on Wikipedia as their sole source of information on a topic, 
even if the article were well-referenced, written by a credible author, and subjected to 
multiple edits. Few teachers or employers would accept a research project that referenced 
Wikipedia as a primary source. In fact, it is always a good idea to check with your instructor 
for guidance before using online resources, such as Wikipedia, in your research.
In this session, you have learned the process for evaluating Web results when 
researching the Web. The determination of Web site quality is not an exact science; but 
with practice, you can develop your skills in this area.
Session 3.2 Quick Check 
	
1.	The three basic Boolean operators are ____________, ____________, and 
__________.
	
2.	Write a search expression using Boolean and precedence operators that returns 
Web pages containing information about wild mustang horses in Wyoming, but 
not information about the Ford Mustang automobile.
	
3.	True or False. The NEAR location operator always returns phrases that contain all 
keywords within 10 words of each other in a search expression.
	
4.	True or False. In most search engines, the wildcard character is a * symbol.
	
5.	Name three kinds of filters you can include in a Google search run from its 
Advanced Search page.
	
6.	What function do parentheses serve in an advanced or Boolean search 
expression?
	
7.	Why is the deep Web so difficult to search?
	
8.	List three factors to consider when evaluating the quality of a Web site.

Finding Current and Specific Information on 
the Web
In Tutorial 3, you learned how to use search engines, directories, and other resources 
to find information on the Web. In many instances, your goal was to find facts about a 
topic. Often, these facts don’t change over time. Sometimes, however, you will need 
to find the most up-to-date information on a particular subject or event. For example, 
Marti’s work at Cosby Promotions involves finding the most recent news and information 
about clients, potential sponsors, performance venues, and trends in the music industry. 
Finding Recent Information
When you are searching for recent news, you could go directly to the Web sites of local 
and national newspapers, magazines, television stations, and radio stations. But the news 
sources you choose to visit might not have articles on the information you want. Instead 
of this hit-or-miss approach, you can conduct a search to determine which sources 
have the information you want. Before conducting a search, you should consider which 
search tool would be the best option: a search engine or a directory. Search engines 
usually include more recent listings because the editorial review process of many Web 
directories takes time to complete. In addition, a Web directory might not include list-
ings for the topic you want to find. 
Most search engines enable you to search for Web sites that have been modified 
recently. This feature is usually included as a filter option on the sites’ advanced search 
pages. The filtering options for selecting recently modified Web pages will be different 
on the various search engines. For example, the Google Advanced Search page allows a 
search to be filtered based on when the page was last updated, as shown in Figure 4-1. You 
choose from among the most recent 24 hours, week, month, or year. Exalead includes an 
advanced search option so you can specify a particular date and search before or after that 
date, or you can include two date arguments in an Exalead search expression and search 
for Web pages modified after one date but before another date.

INSIGHT
How Search Engines Filter Results by Date
Search engines can perform date-filtered searches because when Web servers send 
a Web page to a browser (or a search engine’s Web robot), they include a header 
that contains information about the Web page, such as the date it was last modified. 
Search engines then store this information in their databases and use it to create  
date-filtered results. 
Marti wants to book several of her newest clients to play at Ryman Auditorium in 
Nashville, Tennessee, and she needs to find current information about the auditorium 
to help her prepare for an upcoming meeting with the venue’s manager. Although Web 
directories will collect many useful sites that include the name “Ryman Auditorium” in 
their databases, a search engine would provide more recent listings. In this case, you will 
use Google to search for information on Ryman Auditorium from the past month.

Search engines’ date filtering capabilities are only as good as the information they 
collect. These databases store the date each Web page was last modified. A page gets a 
new modification date no matter how large or small the change is. So, even if most of 
the content on the page did not change, the modification date would still be updated. 
Because of this, a date-filtered search doesn’t always provide the results you want. 
Another good way to find recent information about companies, people, or events is to 
look for current news about them.
Getting Current News
The Web has a variety of sources for current news stories. Some news outlets are avail-
able only online. Others are available both online and offline. Traditional news outlets—
including print and broadcast media—often post news stories on the Web in addition 
to their usual distribution in newspapers and magazines or on the radio and television. 
These Web sites include search features so you can search the site for specific news sto-
ries. Also, search engines and Web directories include links to these types of sources. 
Written Communication: Evaluating Sources of Information 
On the Internet and the Web, information is now disseminated rapidly and extensively, 
and updated frequently. The quantity of information available is astounding in part 
because of the low investment required, and in part because of the new sources of 
information that are easily available. This means that you as the reader need to evaluate 
the material you are reading. 
The cost of publishing on the Web is very low. A Web-based publication can be 
financially successful with few advertisers, no subscribers, and relatively few readers. As a 
result, online publications can focus on the specialized, narrow interests of relatively small 
audiences. Online-only publications such as Slate, Salon.com, and The Huffington Post 
have become established parts of the media industry.
The low cost of Web publishing also means that anyone with the interest and the 
financial means can use the Web to promote his or her views—commonly in the form of a 
Web log (also called a Weblog or blog). A blog is a written commentary on current events, 
personal experiences, or anything else an individual wants to expound upon. Blogs are 
usually written by a single person (called the blogger) who wants to express a particular 
point of view. Some blogs allow readers to add comments or reactions to the blogger’s 
statements, which may be edited or deleted by the blogger. Although blogs exist on a 
wide variety of topics, many blogs focus on political, religious, or other issues about which 
people have strong opinions. Because the blog owner writes the main content and decides 
which comments posted by readers will be included in the blog, the content and direction 
of the blog are controlled by its owner. (You will learn more about blogs in Tutorial 5.)
An alternative form of interactive online writing is the wiki. A wiki is a Web site that is 
designed to allow multiple users to contribute content and edit existing content. “Wiki” 
is a Hawaiian word that means “fast,” and wikis are set up to allow many different users to 
add and edit content quickly and easily. Most wikis are focused on facts or collaborative 
work. Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia that you learned about in Tutorial 3, is probably 
the most famous wiki in the world. A wiki that has received a lot of attention in recent 
years is WikiLeaks, which provides a way for anonymous sources to leak information to its 
journalists, including secret government information. 
You must also determine whether the content is opinion or fact. And, if you see the same 
information repeatedly at several sites, you need to determine the original source of that 
information. For example, various sites could reprint information from the same source, 
making it seem that the information is being corroborated by multiple sources when in 
actuality it is all from one source. With the wide variety of information available on the Web, 
you must be diligent in evaluating the accuracy of the information you are reading.
In many instances, you can 
search the site’s archives 
for older articles.

Internet | Tutorial 4 Information Resources on the Web
One of the simplest ways to find a wide selection of current news reports is to use a 
news aggregation Web site. A news aggregation Web site collects and displays content 
from a variety of online news sources, including wire services, print media, broadcast 
outlets, and even blogs, and displays it in one place. You can then quickly access news 
stories on a topic from multiple sources. 
One example of a news aggregation Web site is Yahoo!, which provides links to dif-
ferent topical sites on its home page. The News link opens the Yahoo! News site, shown 
in Figure 4-3, with access to the latest news and headlines—both in print and broadcast. 
You can access the day’s top stories, latest news, and stories published by a particular 
news outlet. The page also features links to different aspects of the news—such as World, 
Business, Entertainment, Sports, Tech, and Politics—that include corresponding types 
of news stories. Other news aggregation Web sites include Bing News, Google News, 
Drudge Report, The Huffington Post, and NewsNow. Keep in mind that news aggregation 
Web sites, like any other media, may show a bias toward certain points of view. 
You will use a news aggregation Web site to locate current news stories about Ryman 
Auditorium that might not have appeared in the results of your search of recently modi-
fied Web pages.
To find recent news stories on the Web that mention Ryman 
Auditorium:
◗	
1.	 Return to the Weblinks page for Tutorial 4, locate the heading News Aggregation 
Web Site in the Session 4.1 section, and then click the Yahoo! link to open the

INSIGHT
Understanding How News Gets Distributed Electronically
The content for news outlets comes from wire services, newspapers, and broadcast net-
works. A wire service (also called a press agency or news service) is an organization that 
hires reporters to gather and write news stories, which it then distributes to newspapers, 
magazines, broadcasters, Web sites, and other organizations that pay a fee to the wire 
service. 
Although there are hundreds of wire services around the world, most news comes 
from the four largest wire services: United Press International (UPI) and the Associated 
Press (AP) in the United States, Thomson Reuters in Great Britain, and Agence France-
Presse (AFP) in France. In addition to selling stories to print, broadcast, and online news 
outlets around the world, these major wire services all publish current news stories on 
their own Web sites. 
Likewise, print, broadcast, and online news outlets hire reporters to write news 
stories, which might also be distributed or sold to affiliates or other news outlets. Major 
newspapers, such as The New York Times, Washington Post, and the Los Angeles 
Times, have Web sites that include current news and many other features from their 
print editions. All of the major U.S. broadcast networks, including ABC, CBS, CNN, 
FOX, MSNBC, NBC, and NPR, have Web sites that carry news features. Broadcasters 
in other countries, such as the BBC in Great Britain, also provide news reports on their 
Web pages. Local radio and television stations often have their own Web sites where 
they offer selected news, sports, and weather information for their local market areas.
Because many newspapers, magazines, broadcasters, and news aggregation sites 
obtain stories from the major wire services and from each other, you often find the 
same news stories in your search results. Sometimes one news source will edit a story to 
shorten it or add information that appeals to its local audience. In many cases, different 
news outlets will just republish the original story without changes. Keep in mind that 
finding the same story published in multiple places doesn’t mean that it is accurate or 
current. Be sure to evaluate the content as you learned in Tutorial 3 for accuracy and 
currency. 
Finding Up-to-Date Weather Information
Many people consult a weather forecast daily because they want to know the weather 
conditions before dressing and venturing out for the day. When planning a vacation, they 
can review weather patterns for their intended destination. Before packing for a trip, they 
can obtain detailed weather information to guide their clothing choices. Some people 
enjoy seeing the weather conditions for family and friends who live elsewhere. Many 
also want to follow current weather conditions when there is a major storm—whether 
snow, wind, rain, hurricane, etc. These weather forecasts, conditions, and other informa-
tion are available on the Web. 
A number of companies, such as AccuWeather, The Weather Channel, National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Weather Service, and Weather 
Underground, provide weather conditions and forecasts on their Web sites. These Web 
sites also offer a wealth of other features and information, including live radar, graphs,

WEB 194
Internet | Tutorial 4 Information Resources on the Web
10-day forecasts, trip planners, severe weather reports, satellite views, desktop weather 
apps, and video forecasts for different areas. Many sites let you enter your zip code 
so the page always opens with weather for your area. You can also install a gadget on 
your desktop or an app on your smartphone to display the current weather conditions 
for your area.
Some weather sites sell their information to other companies that then include it on 
their Web sites. So you might see an AccuWeather forecast or weather map on many 
other Web sites, such as Yahoo! or your local newspaper’s site. These same weather sites 
are also available as a gadget for your Windows desktop or an app for your smartphone.
Local television and radio stations offer weather information on their Web sites. Some 
of these sites purchase weather information from other outlets such as AccuWeather or 
The Weather Channel, but larger stations usually employ their own meteorologists and 
have their own weather prediction equipment. These local weather forecasts can be more 
accurate and detailed than those provided by the major weather Web sites for your area. 
Marti plans to travel to Nashville later in the week to meet with some country music 
artists whom she hopes to sign as clients for the agency. You will check the weather for 
the Nashville area.
To find weather information for the Nashville area:
◗	
1.	 Return to the Weblinks page for Tutorial 4, and then click one of the links under 
the Weather Information Web Sites heading in the Session 4.1 section. The 
weather site opens in your browser. You can search for the weather forecast for a 
specific location by entering the city and state or a zip code.
◗	
2.	 In the search box, type Nashville, TN and then click the Go, Search, Find 
Weather, or similar button. The local Nashville forecast appears on the page. 
Depending on the site you chose, there might be links to the extended local 
forecast, radar, satellite, and videos or webcams. Figure 4-6 shows the Nashville 
Weather Forecast and Conditions on The Weather Channel’s Web site.

Obtaining Maps and Destination Information
Map sites provide an abundance of information about places. The maps can show a 
broad overview of a region or state, and they can be zoomed to display detailed maps of 
a city or neighborhood. You can get directions to a specific location, observe current traf-
fic and weather conditions, look at a satellite view instead of a street map, and in some 
cases see photos of the location. You can find businesses in the area, including restau-
rants, hotels, and shops; see what activities and attractions are around; identify services 
such as banks, libraries, and pharmacies; and find information such as gas prices and 
parking. Although the information provided by these sites is not perfect (for example, 
new roads and detours caused by current construction work often are not included), they 
are helpful travel aids. Some commonly used sites include Google Maps and MapQuest.
Nashville has been a central location for country music performers for many years. 
In fact, the Grand Ole Opry, a long-running country music radio show, is based in 
Nashville. Marti wants to include a stop at Ryman Auditorium, which is the home of the 
Grand Ole Opry. You will use a map site to determine the location of Ryman Auditorium. 
To locate Ryman Auditorium using Google Maps:
◗	
1.	 Return to the Weblinks page for Tutorial 4, and then click the Google link under 
the Map Site heading in the Session 4.1 section to open the Google home page.
◗	
2.	 Click the Maps link to open the Google Maps search page.

3.	 In the Search box, type Ryman Auditorium, Nashville, TN, and then click the 
Search Maps button. A map of Nashville appears marked with the location of 
Ryman Auditorium. Figure 4-7 shows the map that appears in Google Maps. The 
map includes tools for adjusting your view of the map.

Although map sites often provide basic listings and information about lodging, res-
taurants, attractions, and entertainment opportunities for a particular location, you can 
often find more detailed information and reviews using travel guide sites. These sites 
include descriptive and comprehensive information about a location, reviews of hotels 
and restaurants, trip ideas, travel deals, and calendars of events, as well as discussions, 
photos, and blogs. People often use these sites to plan a trip from selecting a destina-
tion to learning about the history and attractions, finding hotels and restaurants, and

Finding People and Businesses 
Online directory Web sites include listings of businesses and people, much like the 
printed telephone books that were used for decades to find phone numbers and contact 
information as well as businesses and services. Traditionally, white pages directories 
store individuals’ names, addresses, and telephone numbers, and yellow pages direc-
tories store information about businesses. Today, however, the line between yellow and 
white pages directories is blurred. Most big name online directories provide access to 
both people and business contact information. Some common online directories are 
Superpages.com, Yellowbook, YP.com – Yellow Pages, Switchboard, Internet Address 
Finder, White Pages, and Yahoo! People Search.
When looking for a person, you can search for an individual by name, by postal 
address, by email address, or by phone number (called a reverse lookup). In some cases, 
you can find the contact information for people at both home and at work. When look-
ing for a business, you can search for a specific business by name or you can look at 
businesses in a specific category for a geographic area. 
Some sites provide a variety of other features, including maps and driving directions, 
reviews of businesses, area code and zip code lookup, name popularity, a person’s age, 
and information about his or her relatives. Some provide a resource to perform a back-
ground check that looks at a person’s criminal history, address history, personal assets, 
lawsuits, and other legal entanglements. Another resource might be available to find prop-
erty value, sales history, property details, and neighborhood information. However, most 
directory sites charge a fee to access this level of detailed information about a person.
Some Web sites make unpublished and unlisted telephone numbers available for pub-
lic use. Other sites group individual listings by categories, such as religious or political 
affiliation. Many people expressed concerns about privacy violations when this type of 
information became easily accessible on the Web. In response to these privacy concerns, 
most directory sites provide a way for people to remove their listings. For example, 
Switchboard will accept a list removal request made on its Web page or sent by email. 
You might want to verify that white pages directories have a correct listing for you and 
decide whether you want your listing to appear on a white pages site.
Many online white 
pages and yellow pages 
directories are also avail-
able as mobile apps for 
smartphones.

These online directories compile information in several ways. Individuals and busi-
nesses can submit new entries as well as update or correct existing entries. Directory 
sites can also collect information from publicly available sources, published telephone 
directories, and the Web, such as data provided when signing up for a social network 
like Facebook. Directory sites also purchase information from third-party sources, such 
as personal information individuals provided to a business or provided when filling out a 
form to enter a contest or start a subscription. Businesses then share this information with 
online directories. All of this information is indexed by the directory so that it can be 
quickly accessed during a search.
INSIGHT
How Directories Fund Their Services
Business directories provide ads and listings that appear in response to relevant search 
queries on search engines such as Google or Yahoo!. The ads can be static advertise-
ments like you would see in a print directory, or interactive multimedia ads that include 
sound and video. And many directory sites provide sponsored results to searches, which 
means that businesses pay a fee to have their contact information and ads placed higher 
in the search results. The business pays a fee each time its advertisement is clicked.
Marti is planning to develop reciprocal relationships with local booking agencies 
in Nashville. She wants to make some initial contacts during this trip and asks you to 
search the Web to find a list of booking agencies in Nashville. You can use an online 
directory to find music agencies located in Nashville.
To search online directories for a music agency:
◗	
1.	 Return to the Weblinks page for Tutorial 4, locate the Online Directories heading 
in the Session 4.1 section, and then click the link to one of the sites listed to open 
its home page.
◗	
2.	 Click the appropriate link to search for a person (the exact link will vary, but could 
be labeled People Search, Find People, or Find a Person). Figure 4-10 shows the 
Find People tab at Superpages.com. Before looking for a music agency, use the 
site to find your own listing.

Trouble?  If your search doesn’t yield any results, try again using business catego-
ries such as agent, artist, recording artist, or booking agent. If you still don’t find 
any appropriate results, return to the Weblinks for Session 4.1 and try using a dif-
ferent directory site.
Finding Products and Services Online
Many items are available for purchase on the Web: food, clothing, books, computers, 
software, games, music, specialty items, office supplies. Pretty much anything you can 
think of is available. Retailers—big and small as well as international, national, and 
local—have a presence on the Web. Some retailers have both a physical location and 
a Web site; others such as Amazon.com are online only without a storefront/brick-and-
mortar store. In addition, individuals have flocked to the Web to sell their products and 
services. E-commerce, or electronic commerce, refers to the process of developing, mar-
keting, selling, delivering, servicing, and paying for products and services online. You’ll 
learn more about e-commerce in Tutorial 9.
Retail business that occurs 
online is also sometimes 
called e-tail.

Perhaps the most prevalent e-commerce site is Amazon.com. Amazon.com was 
founded by Jeff Bezos in 1995 to sell books on the Web. Since then, Amazon has 
expanded to sell a wide variety of products and services in the categories of books, mov-
ies, music, games, electronics and computers, home, garden, tools, groceries, health and 
beauty, toys, kids and babies, clothing, shoes, jewelry, sports, automotive, and industrial. 
All items are shipped directly to the purchaser or to another recipient specified by the 
purchaser. Since 2000, individuals as well as retailers have been able to partner with 
Amazon to sell their products, creating an online marketplace. 
So, today, when you search for an item on Amazon.com, you can select the depart-
ment you want to search, enter keywords for your search, and then view the results 
sorted in the order you prefer, such as relevance, popularity, price, or average customer 
review. When searching for books, you can also filter the search results by the book for-
mat you want, such as paperback, hardcover, Kindle e-reader edition, HTML, or audio.

Individuals can also sell items on the Web using sites such as eBay and craigslist. 
eBay identifies itself as the world’s online marketplace where buyers and sellers come 
together to trade almost anything. Pierre Omidyar founded the auction site in 1995 
as AuctionWeb, creating a marketplace for individuals to exchange goods. The site’s 
name was changed to eBay in 1997. Today, eBay boasts more than 97 million users 
around the world. It has sites throughout the globe and has acquired or launched a 
variety of businesses, including PayPal (a global online payment company), Shopping.
com (an online comparison shopping site), Half.com (a marketplace for used books, 
movies, music, and games), Rent.com (a listing site for rental housing in the United 
States), Milo.com (a product search company), brands4friends (an online shopping 
club for fashion and lifestyle), and eBay Classifieds (a listing site for classified adver-
tisements). In 2011, it launched Fashion Outlet, the first virtual outlet mall in the 
United States. 
You can find a variety of items on eBay, ranging from autographs to toys to antiques 
to books. Individuals place items for sale, choosing either to create an auction listing 
and accept only bids for the item, or to allow people to purchase the item right away for 
a set amount. For the online auction, the seller sets the minimum bid and the length of 
the auction; then, at the end of the allotted time, the highest bid wins. For a Buy It Now 
listing, the first person willing to pay the indicated price gets the item. Payment for an 
item is made through PayPal, which is a global online payment company people can use 
to send or receive secure payments without sharing their personal financial information. 
Anyone can view the items up for auction, but you must register with eBay to post or bid 
on an item.

Another popular site where individuals can buy and sell items is craigslist. In 1995, 
Craig Newmark started sending emails to friends about events in the San Francisco Bay 
Area. The following year, he changed his email distribution list into a Web-based service 
that included additional categories. In 2000, craigslist started expanding to other cities in 
the United States. 
Today, craigslist is a network of more than 700 local sites in 70 countries that features 
free online classified advertisements with sections devoted to jobs, housing, personals, 
for sale, services, community, gigs, resumes, and discussion forums. See Figure 4-13. To 
buy or sell an item, a seller posts an ad following the site’s guidelines, and buyers con-
tact the seller to arrange the purchase, payment, and delivery of that item.

Understanding Copyright 
Many Web page elements and other items you find online are a form of intellectual 
property, which includes all creations of the human mind, such as original ideas and 
creative works presented in a form that can be shared or that others can recreate, emu-
late, or manufacture. On a Web page, intellectual property includes the images, videos, 
and text on the page, as well as the design of the page itself. Intellectual property as a 
tangible expression of an idea is protected just like other tangible forms of property, such 
as houses, and cars. Each country has its own rules and laws governing intellectual prop-
erty rights and protection. In the United States, intellectual property is protected through 
patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and copyrights.
As you learned in Tutorial 1, a copyright is literally the right of a person to make cop-
ies of his or her work. Copyrights are granted by a government to the author or creator 
of an original work who creates a tangible expression of that work or creation. Creations 
that can be copyrighted include virtually all forms of artistic or intellectual expression, 
such as books, music, artwork, audio and video recordings, architectural drawings, cho-
reographic works, product packaging, and computer software. The tangible form of the 
work can be words, numbers, notes, sounds, pictures, and so forth. Copyright protection 
exists whether the work is published or unpublished.
A collection of facts can be copyrighted, but only if the collection is arranged, coordi-
nated, or selected in a way that causes the resulting work to rise to the level of an origi-
nal work. For example, the Yahoo! Directory is a collection of links to URLs. These URLs 
existed before Yahoo! selected and arranged them into the form of its directory. However, 
most intellectual property experts would argue that the selection and arrangement of the 
links into categories probably makes the directory copyrightable.
The copyright is in effect for the length of time specified in the copyright law and 
gives the author or creator the exclusive right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, pub-
licly perform, publicly display, or sell the work. In the United States, under the 1976 
Copyright Act, works created after 1977 are protected for the life of the author (or the 
last surviving author in the case of a “joint work” with multiple authors) plus another  
70 years. Works made for hire and anonymous or pseudonymous works are protected for 
95 years from the date of publication or 120 years from the date of creation, whichever 
is earlier. The copyright holder can transfer, license, sell, donate, or leave the copyright 
to his or her heirs. Works created before 1978 are protected under the 1909 Copyright 
Act and have more complex and variable terms of copyright.
Determining Fair Use 
U.S. copyright law allows people to use portions of copyrighted works without obtain-
ing permission from the copyright holder if that use is a fair use. Section 107 of the 
1976 Copyright Act lists criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and 
research as examples of uses that may be eligible for fair use. However, the circum-
stances surrounding a particular use determine whether that use is considered fair. Keep 
in mind that the legal definition of fair use is intentionally broad and can be difficult to 
interpret. As a result, many disputes about whether a use is fair have landed in court. 
Courts generally consider the following four factors when determining fair use: 
1.	 The purpose and character of the new work. This factor considers such issues as 
whether the use adds something new to the body of knowledge and arts or just 
reproduces the work, and whether the use is commercial or for nonprofit educa-
tional purposes. 
2.	 The nature of the copyrighted work. In general, more creative works have stronger 
protection than factual works. Keep in mind that an unpublished work has the 
same copyright protections for fair use as a published work.

WEB 211
Tutorial 4 Information Resources on the Web | Internet
3.	 The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted 
work as a whole; in other words, how much of the copyrighted work was used. 
The less work that is used, the more likely it falls under fair use. However, using 
even a small amount of the work can be copyright infringement if it is the heart 
of the work. This is especially true with musical compositions. The use of even a 
small portion of a copyrighted song can be an infringing use. 
4.	 The effect of the use on the potential market, or value, of the copyrighted work. For 
example, does the use of the copyrighted material hurt the market for the original 
work, and does it impair or limit the ability of the copyright owner to earn income 
or otherwise benefit from the work?
Again, no hard-and-fast rule determines fair use. If you are unsure whether your use is 
indeed fair use, the safest course of action is to contact the copyright owner and ask for 
permission to use the work.
One area where fair use disputes are prevalent is videos being posted on YouTube. 
Consider that any one video can include both original and copyrighted material. A video 
that includes even a small clip from a movie or television show or part of a song written 
or performed by someone else can constitute copyright infringement. This means that the 
copyright owner can sue the person who created and posted the video. 
To learn more about fair use, you can use the links in the Fair Use section of the 
Additional Information section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 4.
Works in the Public Domain 
Once the term of the copyright has expired, the work moves into the public domain, 
which means that anyone is free to copy the work without requesting permission from 
the last copyright holder. Older literary works, such as A Tale of Two Cities by Charles 
Dickens that was published in 1859, are in the public domain and may be reproduced 
freely. Songs or musical works published earlier than 1922, such as the Star Spangled 
Banner written by Francis Scott Key in 1814, are also in the public domain in the United 
States, although sound recordings are not in the public domain. 
A copyright can protect a particular expression of a creative work in addition to the 
work itself. For example, a Mozart symphony is in the public domain because it was 
written hundreds of years ago and is no longer protected by Austrian copyright law. But 
Mozart’s creative work was writing the notes of the symphony down on paper in a par-
ticular form. If the Cleveland Orchestra makes an audio recording of that public domain 
Mozart symphony, its performance is a separate work that can be copyrighted by the 
Cleveland Orchestra and protected under current copyright laws.
Authors or creators can place their work into the public domain voluntarily at any 
time. For example, some Web sites provide graphics files that visitors can use free of 
charge. You can include public domain content on a Web page, in a paper, or in any 
other form of creative expression. However, you should still acknowledge the source of 
the public domain material and not represent the work as your own, which is plagiarism.
 Web sites that offer free 
files for noncommercial 
use often carry a restriction 
against selling or redistrib-
uting those files.

INSIGHT
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act
When Congress passed the 1976 Copyright Act, personal computers, the Internet and 
Web, email, digital photos, and other electronic content did not exist. However, with 
these newer technologies and media came new copyright concerns and issues. 
In 1998, Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to help 
protect copyright owners from online infringement or piracy. The DMCA addresses the 
following common issues: circumvention of copyright protection systems, fair use in a 
digital environment, and online service provider liability. The DMCA prohibits individu-
als from bypassing technologies that the copyright holders have added to their works 
to prevent others from using them even if that use would be considered a fair use. 
However, since 2010, the Librarian of Congress has said that accessing a small portion 
for educational uses by college professors and students would no longer be prohibited. 
Finally, the DMCA protects online service providers that act as “mere conduits” to pro-
vide transitory digital communications or that host third-party material on their servers 
and networks such as YouTube. As long as the service providers respond to copyright 
owners’ claims, take down the material, and cancel accounts of repeat offenders, they 
are protected from some copyright infringement liability.

Understanding Plagiarism
The Internet makes it very easy to copy someone else’s work. If you use someone else’s 
work, whether the work is in the public domain or protected by copyright, you must cite 
the source of the material. Failure to cite the source of material that you use is called 
plagiarism. Claiming someone else’s work as your own is a serious legal violation that 
can lead to a failing grade, being expelled from school, being fired from a job, or being 
subjected to a hefty fine or prosecution. 
Plagiarism can be as simple as including a sentence or two from someone else’s work 
without using quotation marks or attribution. It can be as blatant as duplicating substan-
tial parts of someone else’s work and claiming it as your own. It can be more subtle, 
such as paraphrasing someone else’s content without the proper citation of the source. 
Another form of plagiarism is when students purchase essays, term papers, and even 
theses or dissertations from commercial services and then pass them off as their own. 
To combat the growing issue of plagiarism, academic instructors, researchers, publish-
ers, and others have turned to Web resources. A number of plagiarism checker sites are 
available for free or for a fee to detect plagiarism in written content. These sites compare 
the submitted work against archived student papers; publications including articles in 
journals, periodicals, and newspapers; books; databases; and Web page content. These 
sites can check for exact duplication or a paraphrase of someone else’s work. 
For example, Turnitin is a Web site that checks a submitted paper against 14 billion 
Web pages, 150 million student papers, and millions of articles from leading library 
databases and publications, and then determines how much of the paper is unoriginal. 
Figure 4-16 shows the home page for Turnitin.
To ensure that you don’t unintentionally plagiarize someone else’s work, be sure to 
properly reference the sources of works that you use. Keep in mind that just including a 
source citation is not enough if you plan to use the finished product commercially. You 
must also obtain the copyright holder’s permission if you want to use the work in a way 
that falls outside of fair use.
To learn more about sites that check your writing for plagiarism, you can use the links 
in the Plagiarism Checkers section of the Additional Information section of the Weblinks  
page for Tutorial 4.

Citing Web Resources
To avoid charges of plagiarism, all works you reference in a report or paper—whether 
they are protected by copyright, in the public domain, or considered fair use—need to 
be documented. This gives proper credit to the original authors as well as provides read-
ers with the information they need to find and review the works you used. 
However, documentation can become a challenge when you are referencing a Web 
page. Because the Web is a dynamic medium that changes constantly, the content of any 
given page can change in an instant. Also, its URL can change or disappear from day 
to day. Unlike published books and journals, which have a physical existence, a Web 
page exists only in an HTML document on a Web server computer. If the file’s name or

location changes, or if the Web server is disconnected from the Internet, the page is no 
longer accessible.
To address this issue, digital intellectual content such as online journals, articles, 
reports, and white papers are assigned a unique alphanumeric string of characters, called 
a digital object identifier (DOI), to identify that content and provide a persistent link to 
its location (or locations) as long as the content exists somewhere on the Internet. 
All DOI numbers begin with 10. followed by a prefix of a unique combination of 
four or more digits, then a slash, and finally a suffix that is any alphanumeric combina-
tion that identifies the publisher. The International DOI Foundation issues prefixes to 
DOI Registration Agencies, such as CrossRef.org, which then assign them to publishers 
and others. The publisher assigns the suffix using a unique identifier such as the book’s 
ISBN. The DOI usually appears near the copyright notice. Unlike a URL, a DOI does not 
change when the content moves to a new location. If the content exists in multiple forms 
on the Web—for example, in one location as an Adobe PDF file and in another as a 
Microsoft Word file—all forms will have the same DOI. 
For academic research, the two most widely followed standards for citations are those 
of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Modern Language Association 
(MLA). The APA and MLA formats for Web page citations are similar. Both include the

Formatting URL Line Breaks
One difficulty of including long URLs or DOIs is typesetting them in printed documents. 
However, if you must include one and it does not fit on one line, you should break the URL 
or DOI only after a slash that occurs in the address. Also, you should not add a hyphen at 
the line break because a reader might mistakenly type the hyphen as part of the URL. 
To learn more about format styles for citing sources, use the links in the Citation 
Formats section of the Additional Information section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 4.
Accessing Text-Based Resources Online
Over the past decades, many reference materials that were once available only in 
print have become available electronically, and in many cases on the Web. Before 
that, anyone wanting to learn more about a topic had to go to a library to perform 
research using print resources. For example, encyclopedias were one of the first types 
of resources made available in electronic format; cross-references to other topics were 
made into hyperlinks, glossary definitions were changed to pop-up windows, and the 
entire encyclopedia became searchable by keyword. Unlike the print editions, digital 
versions could include audio and video clips. One of the earliest and most popular 
digital encyclopedias was Microsoft Encarta, which was available starting in 1993 on 
CD-ROMs. Dictionaries, thesauri, and almanacs soon followed. As access to the Web 
became more widespread, these sources were placed online. 
Today, libraries offer content (books, periodicals, journals, and so forth) in a wide 
variety of formats. With the huge number of books being published every year, libraries 
don’t have enough shelf space to store print versions of every resource. As a result, librar-
ies are buying fewer printed books and offering more content electronically. Publishers 
are encouraging this trend by making digital content cheaper and easier to access. 
Consequently, an increasing number of books are available as e-books, which are elec-
tronic versions of books that are read on electronic readers (also called e-readers) such 
as the Kindle and the iPad as well as computers, tablets, and smartphones. 
In addition, libraries can subscribe to huge databases that offer a wealth of informa-
tion, which individuals cannot usually afford. For example, Dow Jones Factiva is a com-
prehensive global news and business information and research tool that provides access 
to top media outlets, trade and consumer publications, and business Web sites along 
with in-depth company, executive, and industry profiles; expert analysis; market data; 
and detailed reports. ProQuest Dialog is a combination of online research tools that 
provides online-based information services in subject areas such as business, science, 
engineering, finance, and law, in a format designed to meet the specific needs of a wide 
range of users, including information professionals and end users at business, profes-
sional, scientific, academic, and government organizations in more than 100 countries.
Likewise, other print resources—such as periodicals, scholarly journals, and govern-
ment resources—have become available on the Web. This has helped these resources to 
remain current and easily accessible to their audiences. In addition, it means that these 
resources are now available day and night, regardless of whether the business or library 
in which they are housed is open. 
Online References
The Web contains many online references, including dictionaries, thesauri, encyclo-
pedias, atlases, almanacs, quotations, grammar checkers, rhyming dictionaries, and 
language-translation sites to name just a few. These online references range in quality 
from very low to very high, so be sure to consider the results for accuracy. Some online 
In many instances, virtual 
libraries and online refer-
ence sites overlap and/or 
link to one another.

reference resources require a subscription fee, but many free online reference tools also 
exist. Some common free online reference sites include Dictionary.com, Thesaurus.com, 
Merriam-Webster Online dictionary and thesaurus, World Sites Atlas, Enclopedia.com, 
Britannica Online Encyclopedia, BrainyQuote, and The Quotations Page. To learn more 
about online references, use the links in the Online References section of the Additional 
Information section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 4.
The Web also includes sites that offer full-text copies of works that are no longer 
protected by copyright. Two well-known full-text sites are the Project Gutenberg and 
Bartleby.com Web sites. These volunteer efforts have collected the contributions of many 
people throughout the world who have spent enormous amounts of time entering or con-
verting printed text into electronic form. The Project Gutenberg site currently offers more 
than 36,000 free e-books and is supported by donations. The Bartleby.com site, which 
is named for the main character in Herman Melville’s famous short story “Bartleby the 
Scrivener,” was converted into a privately held corporate site in 1999. Since then, it has 
used advertising to generate revenue to support its operations. The Bartleby.com home 
page is shown in Figure 4-18.

The Web itself has become the subject of archivists’ attention. The Internet Archive’s 
Wayback Machine provides researchers with a series of snapshots of Web pages as  
they were at various points in the history of the Web. The site has archived more than 
150 billion Web pages since 1996. The Internet Archive site also stores text, moving 
image, audio, and other files that have been contributed to the site. The wide array of 
information at the Internet Archive site makes it a valuable resource for a variety of 
research projects. The Internet Archive home page is shown in Figure 4-19.

Periodical Databases
Periodicals—magazines, journals, and other articles—related to almost any industry, 
field, or topic abound. Originally periodicals were available only in printed format at 
libraries, but now thousands of periodicals are available on the Web. If you know what 
periodical you want to search, you could go directly to its Web site. If you are more 
interested in articles related to a particular topic, then you can use a periodical database 
to locate them. For example, MagPortal.com is a search engine and directory for finding 
online magazine articles. It has indexed articles from hundreds of magazines. You can 
browse the indexed articles by topic or you can search for articles based on a keyword 
you supply.
Marti wants to find current information about digital music and how it is affecting the 
music industry. You will see what information you can find using MagPortal.com.
To find information about digital music in magazine articles:

Online and Virtual Libraries 
Most libraries now provide online access to their collections and services. You can search 
the library catalog and reserve books or place books on hold. You can access articles from 
newspapers and magazines, and search databases to which the library subscribes. You can 
also access general reference resources, including encyclopedias, almanacs, dictionaries, 
thesauri, language dictionaries, quotations, time and calendar information, world facts, 
population, and statistics. Many libraries also provide access to Web-based books and vid-
eos, as well as make available e-books, e-journals, and digital audiobooks for download to 
use on a computer, an e-reader such as a Kindle or an iPad, or a mobile device.
Another way to access library information is through a virtual library, which is a Web 
site that provides online access to library information services. Some virtual libraries are 
also portal sites that link to a variety of library and reference sites on the Web. A portal 
site is a Web site that you use as a gateway or entry to other sites on the Web. The portal 
site can be general and provide access to a wide variety of Web sites, or it can be spe-
cialized and provide access to related sites. 
One virtual library, ipl2, describes itself as a global information community that offers 
a collaborative research forum, and supports and enhances library services by provid-
ing authoritative collections, information assistance, and instruction for the public. From

Written Communication: Summarizing Research Results
Research is the first step toward conveying information and facts in a written report. 
When you summarize your research results, how you organize the information and write 
the report is just as important as the quality of the research that you have done. If you do 
an excellent job gathering the facts, be sure to deliver a report that is clear and easy to 
understand. This ensures that your audience benefits from your hard work and gets the 
information they need. A lack of clarity can introduce noise into the communication and 
prevent readers from getting the message you intend to convey.
As you research a topic, be sure to take accurate notes about what you learn. 
Remember to include complete information about your sources so you can cite them as 
needed in your report. After you finish your research, you should organize your notes into 
a logical order so that you can present the information clearly and logically. 
As you begin writing, make sure it’s apparent why you are writing in the first place. Are 
you writing to inform, to entertain, or to express your opinion? When writing a factual 
report, your opinions are not relevant and should not be included. Next, determine 
the appropriate writing style: formal or informal. If you are writing for a professor or 
supervisor, you usually use a more formal tone than you would in a casual email to a 
colleague, friend, or family member. 
When you have finished your report, be sure to read it carefully, keeping the recipient’s 
viewpoint in mind. Make sure your points are clear and are presented in a logical order. 
Also, check your spelling and grammar, and correct any errors that you find. However, do 
not rely only on spelling and grammar checkers because they do not always find all errors. 
You might find it helpful to read what you have written out loud to determine whether 
your intended message and tone are coming through clearly. As a final step, you could 
ask a friend or colleague to read your final report and provide feedback.

Government Sites 
The United States government collects and creates a wide variety of information and pro-
vides many services—from laws, tax codes, and Supreme Court rulings, to data on the 
census, the environment and energy, commerce, jobs, education, public safety, science 
and technology, travel and transportation, health and nutrition, and voting and elections. 
Much of this information is available on the Web. You can go to local, state, and 
federal government agency sites to locate specific information, such the U.S. Census 
Bureau, the U.S. Government Printing Office, NASA, and the U.S. Library of Congress. 
For example, the U.S. Library of Congress Web site includes links to a huge array 
of research resources, ranging from the THOMAS legislative information site to the 
Library of Congress archives. The home page for the THOMAS section of the Library of 
Congress Web site is shown in Figure 4-23. The THOMAS Web site is a serious research 
tool that provides access to the full text of bills that are before the U.S. Congress, the 
Congressional Record, and Congressional Committee Reports. News reporters, investiga-
tive journalists, and civic-minded citizens all use this site to find detailed information 
about how the U.S. government operates.

You can also use a portal site to access any government-related information from a 
central place. USA.gov is the official Web portal for the U.S. government. It provides 
access to all official U.S. government services and information in one place so you can 
easily find all U.S. government information that has been posted on the Internet.

In addition to the vast text-based material on the Internet, you can find graphics such 
as clip art, animations, and photos, as well as audio and video clips. 
Multimedia on the Web
Most Web pages include a variety of multimedia elements. Multimedia is anything you 
can see or hear, including text, pictures, audio/sound, videos, films, or animations. 
These multimedia elements are used to enhance the information presented on Web 
pages. The use of multimedia elements on Web sites has, in many instances, improved 
the functionality and usefulness of the Web. Retail sites can show multiple images of an 
item for sale, providing different views or showing an item such as a shirt in different 
colors. News sites can provide videos of unfolding events as they happen. Music sites 
can include audio clips to let customers listen to parts of songs before they buy them. 
Do-it-yourself help sites can provide videos that show demonstrations, such as a master 
plumber installing a new sink. The use of multimedia on the Web is limited only by the 
Web designer’s imagination and creativity.
The Web is also a great resource for users seeking specific multimedia such as graph-
ics, photos, videos, and music to use for their own purposes and entertainment.
Finding Graphic Images on the Web
“Graphic” is a generic term that can refer to a variety of still images, including pho-
tographs, clip art, and line drawings. An abundance of graphic images are available 
in electronic form on the Web. These are commonly in one of three file formats: JPEG 
images for photographs, GIF images for line drawings, and PNG images for more com-
plex graphics. You’ll learn more about these file formats in Tutorial 8. 
There are a variety of ways to find graphic images on the Web. You can use a search 
engine such as Google or Bing to locate images related to your search term. You can fil-
ter the search results to show only images, and then further refine the filter to show only 
images of a certain size; full-color or black-and-white images; a specific type of image 
such as a face, a photo, clip art, or a line drawing; as well as images posted during a 
certain time frame such as the past week. When you click an image in the search results, 
a larger version of that image appears along with information about the image, including 
the Web site where it originated, the size of the image, the file type, the date, and some-
times the camera and settings specifications used to create that image.
You can also search stock photography sites, which are devoted to providing stock 
images for sale and licensing. Stock images are professional photographs, line draw-
ings, and other graphics that are available for purchase. Stock images are immediately 
available, can be sold to multiple customers, and are usually affordable. Companies that 
offer stock photographs and images for sale include Shutterstock, Bigstock, iStockphoto, 
Corbis Images, and Getty Images. You can also license specific uses of the images, such 
as displaying an image on a Web page. Some sites permit downloading of at least some 
files for personal use. You can also contribute your own photos and images to the sites. 
You can also find photographs to use through photo-sharing sites such as Yahoo! 
Flickr and Google Picasa. Flickr has partnered with Getty Images to make its members’ 
photographs available for licensing to others. You can either submit specific photos to 
Getty Images for review, or you can allow other Flickr members to make a request to 
license any of your images. Getty Images reviews requests and handles the permissions, 
releases, and pricing details. You’ll learn more about Flickr and photo-sharing sites in 
Tutorial 5.
To learn more about finding images, use the links in the Stock Images and Photo Sharing 
Sites section of the Additional Information section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 4.

engine you used, you might see a description of the image, detailed informa-
tion about the image such as file size and type, and a note about any copyright 
restrictions. Figure 4-26 shows the enlarged image on the Google Images page.
Finding Audio Files on the Web
In addition to images, you can find audio files on the Web. The term “audio” refers 
to sounds of any type: instrumental music, songs with vocals, speeches, audio books, 
sound effects such as a creaky door or a barking dog, and so forth. Audio searches are 
most commonly conducted to find music and books. Other popular searches include 
special effects and sounds that might be used on a Web site. 
Audio files are available in a variety of formats. Most music is now available in the 
MP3 file format. MP3 (MPEG Audio Layer 3) files can hold information about the music 
they store, such as the title, the artist’s name, and even a photo of the album cover. Other 
sounds might be in WAV, MIDI, or AU formats, which are described in Figure 4-27.

Description
MP3 (MPEG Audio 
Layer 3)
.mp3 
The audio portion of the MPEG file format; most popular 
for music and audio books.
WAV (Wave)
.wav
Jointly developed by Microsoft and IBM; stores digital 
audio and can be played on any Windows computer 
that supports sound; can be recorded at different quality 
levels, which results in different size files (higher quality 
means a larger file).
MIDI (Musical 
Instrument Digital 
Interface)
.midi or .mid
The standard adopted by the music industry for control-
ling devices that create and read musical information; 
much smaller than WAV files.
AU (audio UNIX) format
.au
The original audio format because much of the Internet 
was originally constructed on computers running the 
UNIX operating system; stores sound at various quality 
levels, creating files that are approximately the same size 
as WAV files recorded at similar quality levels.
Music CDs are recorded in the WAV format at a very high-quality level. A standard 
CD has a capacity of about 650 MB and can hold about 74 minutes of high-quality 
stereo music. Files in the MP3 format are somewhat lower in quality than WAV format 
files, but they are 90% smaller. This means that a CD that holds 15 popular songs in 
high-quality WAV format (about 40 megabytes per song) could instead hold 150 popular 
songs in MP3 format (about 4 megabytes per song). 
The MIDI format records information about each element of the sound—including 
its pitch, length, and volume—in a digital format. Most keyboard synthesizers and other 
electronic instruments use MIDI so that music recorded on one instrument can be played 
on other instruments. MIDI files can also be played on computers that have a MIDI inter-
face or MIDI software. It is much easier to edit music recorded in the MIDI format than 
music recorded in the WAV format because the individual characteristics of the sound 
can be manipulated with precision. MIDI files are much smaller than WAV files and are 
used when storage space is at a premium. Many mobile phone ringtones, for example, 
are in the MIDI format. 
Although very few new audio files are created in the AU format today, this format still 
appears on the Web and most Web browsers can read it. The AU format can store sound 
at various quality levels, and the resulting files are approximately the same size as WAV 
files recorded at similar quality levels. 
INSIGHT
Downloading Plug-Ins
Unlike graphic files, audio and video files appear on the Web in many different formats. 
In order for your Web browser to play these different formats, you might need to install 
additional software extensions. These software extensions, or plug-ins, are usually avail-
able as free downloads. The companies that offer media players as free downloads earn 
their profits by selling encoding software to developers who want to include audio and 
video files in that format on their Web sites. Each company that creates a format has an 
incentive to promote its use, so a variety of audio and video formats are used on the 
Web today. You will learn more about plug-ins in Tutorial 8.

You can find audio on the Web in a variety of places. A growing number of record-
ing artists and bands sell and distribute their music on their own Web sites. Many online 
stores, such as Amazon.com, also sell digitized music. These sites have obtained the 
legal right to distribute the musical works they offer for sale. Some of these sites charge 
a download fee per song, whereas others charge a monthly fee that allows subscribers to 
download as many songs as they wish. There are also digital music subscription services 
such as Rhapsody, Pandora, and Rara Music that you can subscribe to and create custom 
playlists from millions of songs that are available on the service. Sometimes referred to as 
Internet radio stations, you can listen to the music on most connected devices, including 
computers, smartphones, and tablets. 
Digital audio books are also popular download items. Like music, you can purchase 
audio books directly from publishers, from etailers such as Amazon.com, or on sites 
devoted to audio books, such as LibriVox, Audible, and Audiobooks.com. Some books 
are in the public domain and have been recorded so that people can listen to them for 
free. Others are still protected by copyright and must be purchased or used as part of a 
subscription service. Some libraries also offer digital audio books for checkout just like 
printed books in their catalog. 
To learn more about digital audio books, use the links in the Digital Audio Books Sites 
section of the Additional Information section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 4. 
Some sites that sell downloadable music place restrictions on the number of copies 
you can make of each song. A few of these sites restrict you from converting downloaded 
song files into other formats, or they restrict the types of devices on which you are per-
mitted to play the song. The restrictions are implemented in the files themselves, using 
systems of encoding called digital rights management (DRM). Because different online 
music vendors use different DRM systems, their files might not be compatible with each 
other. Because of these differing DRM systems and because you can incur legal liability 
by using or copying downloaded files (even those you have purchased) in ways that the 
vendor prohibits, you should always check the site carefully for details about file formats 
and copying restrictions before you buy songs or sign up for a subscription.
Marti wants to listen to some classic country music before meeting with potential 
clients in Nashville. You will find songs by Johnny Cash that can be purchased and 
downloaded.

INSIGHT
Storing Multimedia Files in the Cloud 
Image, music, and audio books are more commonly being stored in the cloud. The 
cloud is a group of technologies and services that provide computing over the Internet 
so people can interact with programs and data using any device that can access the 
Internet, including computers, tablets, and smartphones. People are using cloud com-
puting to share software and networking resources. More sites are providing cloud stor-
age in which you can save and access files. This allows users to store their files remotely 
and access them from any device with the appropriate software and Internet access. 
For example, in 2011 Apple launched iCloud, which provides subscribers with space 
to store digital content, including music, photos, books, and documents. It also keeps 
changing content such as email, calendars, and contacts up to date on all your devices 
running iCloud. So you can use your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and computer to access 
the same files and information.
Finding Video Files 
The term video refers to content that has a progression of visual images and can include 
audio as well. Video clips are commonly included in a variety of different types of Web 
sites, including news sites to show events that have occurred, retail sites to demonstrate 
how a product works, broadcasting sites to play television shows, and music sites to 
show bands performing their songs. 
High-quality audio files and video files of any significant length can be very large, 
especially if the files are in a digital format. Therefore, all online video is compressed to 
make it faster to download or play. Although a video file can be completely downloaded 
and then played, streaming transmission lets users watch the video file in real time. 
In a streaming transmission, the Web server sends the first part of the file to a Web 
browser or a media player program such as RealPlayer or Windows Media Player, which 
uncompresses and then plays the file. While the first part of the file plays, the server is 
sending the next segment of the file. Streaming transmission allows you to access large 
audio or video files in less time than the download-then-play procedure because the 
streamed file begins playing before it finishes downloading. RealNetworks, Inc. pio-
neered streaming technology. Video files on the Web are available in a variety of formats, 
including Flash, MPEG, AVI, and 3GP formats. Figure 4-29 describes some of the more 
common formats.

redesign of the menus and table settings for each night. He wants you to help the design 
team by gathering art and photos from the Web that the team might use in the illustration 
of the menus or design of the table settings. Complete the following steps:
 1. Start your Web browser, go to www.cengagebrain.com, open the Tutorial 4 Weblinks 
page, and then click the Case Problem 5 link.
 2. Click one of the links in the Image Search Engines section and use it to conduct a 
search for images or photos that represent France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Portugal, 
and Ireland.
 3. Return to the Tutorial 4 Weblinks page, and repeat the search using another search 
engine.
 4. Examine the search results for images or photos that would be suitable to use in the 
menu redesign assignment. Find two images or photos for each country (a total of 12).
 5. When you find a suitable image, examine the Web site on which you found it to 
determine what copyright or other restrictions exist for using that image. (Hint: You 
need to look for restrictions that could prevent the team from using the images or 
photos in print; these restrictions might be different from restrictions on online use.)
 6. Prepare a report that includes a brief description of each image or photo, its source, 
the URL of the site where you found it, and a summary of the restrictions on Europa’s 
use of the image in printed materials. If the Web site does not include any descrip-
tion of restrictions, state your opinion (based on what you have learned in this tuto-
rial) regarding what restrictions might exist on Europa’s use of the image.
 7. Close your Web browser.
Find images 
for a menu 
and determine 
the copyright 
limitations on  
their use.

Evaluating Different Methods of Internet 
Communication
Case	|	Shilling Social Media
A few years ago, Kay Shilling lost her corporate job as a marketing 
executive when her company implemented a workforce reduction 
strategy. Kay contacted dozens of potential employers for months, 
only to discover that jobs in her field were scarce. After many disap-
pointments, Kay began helping small businesses in her community 
get started with their Internet marketing, including building and 
maintaining Facebook pages and Twitter accounts. Kay realized that 
her extensive experience in marketing and social networking gave 
her a perfect skill set for starting a new business, which she has 
incorporated using the business name Shilling Social Media. Her 
business will offer her professional services to help new and exist-
ing small to medium-sized businesses create, maintain, and manage 
the online “social” side of their marketing efforts. 
Kay already has the basis for the business in her home: a dedicated 
home office, a new laptop computer, and a smartphone, along with 
many references from local businesses that she has already helped. 
She will begin by reviewing the Internet and its many forms of com-
munication, keeping a watchful eye on any new technologies and 
communication methods that she can use in running own business, 
or that might be appropriate for her clients’ needs.

PULL TECHNOLOGIES
A feed sends subscribed 
users frequently updated 
content on a schedule 
that the user specifies. A 
feed might include news 
topics, blog updates, or 
podcasts.
A newsgroup is a discussion group 
that occurs over a computer network 
with many users contributing to 
a specific topic. The Internet has 
thousands of newsgroups on many 
different topics.
A mailing list is a list of names and email 
addresses for a group of people who share a 
common interest in a specific or broad topic 
and exchange information by subscribing 
to the list. The Internet has thousands of 
mailing lists on many different topics.
A mashup is a Web site that combines 
the data and functionality from different 
Web resources to create a new Web site 
that is updated by those resources. 
A podcast is an audio or video 
broadcast that is created and 
saved in a digital format and then 
stored on a computer or server. 
Users can subscribe to a podcast 
to receive it on a specific schedule, 
or listen to it at their leisure.

Internet | Tutorial 5 User-Generated Content on the Internet
Push and Pull Communication
Until a few years ago, users would search the Internet for information and use links to 
visit a Web page or multiple Web sites to gather information. In this scenario, the Web 
was a resource—much like a library on a school campus—that required action on your 
part to get information from it. You found the sites, reviewed them, and perhaps even 
used your Web browser to create bookmarks so you could revisit those sites. These Web 
sites were mostly static, with updates being posted by the Web site’s developer on a 
regular basis. During this time, you found the site and viewed it, and later returned to 
the site and checked it for updates. You used these Web sites to pull the information you 
wanted to your computer so you could view it.
Several years ago, with new software and imaginative ways of using existing software, 
the way people used the Web changed. In addition to searching for content, you could 
identify content you wanted and have it sent to you, either at your request or on a certain 
schedule. As more users put more information on the Web, this idea of “pushing” con-
tent to other users created a new way of using the Web for people who were “pulling” 
content to their computers.
You can group the Internet’s many communication methods into two basic categories: 
push and pull. Some communication methods use push technology to send content to 
users who request it. Some examples of push technology are chat, instant messaging, 
online social networks, photo- and video-sharing sites, and blogs. The other communica-
tion method, which is called pull technology because subscribers “pull” content to their 
computers when they want it, includes mailing lists, newsgroups, feeds, podcasts, and 
mashups. Some communication methods are both push and pull, depending on who is 
using them. For example, the person who writes a blog is pushing content to other users, 
who then pull it to their computers so they can read it.
Some communication methods don’t fit into neat categories based on the method 
they use, but you can still categorize them based on the technology they use to dissemi-
nate information or on the way the information is combined. The Visual Overview for 
Session 5.1 describes the pull technologies that you will learn about in this session.
Web 2.0
Some people think of pulling content as the “old” Internet—you had to find the 
resources and establish how you would pull the information to your computer. Over 
the past several years, the Web has evolved so that connected people push information 
to users who request it or just wander into it. This change is sometimes called the “new 
Internet” or Web 2.0, a term coined during a brainstorming session between representa-
tives of O’Reilly Media and MediaLive International. During the session, Tim O’Reilly 
and Dale Dougherty were characterizing the changes in Web technology and how these 
changes affected the way people used and accessed the Web. Web 2.0 creates users who 
actively participate in writing the content that they are viewing—hence the term “user-
generated content.” Web 2.0 users not only interact with content; they also are given 
new and easy ways to create it. In fact, Web 2.0 isn’t a “new” Internet at all. The term 
itself is intended to indicate a change in the way people use the Web, just like a version 
change in a software program indicates that a new release of the software is better than 
the old version. Web 2.0 applications enable users to manage and distribute informa-
tion gathered from online communities to people all over the world, who then take the 
information and work to improve, enhance, and forward it to new users.
Web 2.0 applications vary, but they all rely in some way on the interactions of com-
munities of people and their data. Web 2.0 includes online social networks, mashups, 
photo- and video-sharing sites, blogs, microblogs, feeds, and podcasts. (You will learn 
about these technologies as you complete this tutorial.)
You learned about another 
Web 2.0 application, wikis, 
in Tutorial 4.

Tutorial 5 User-Generated Content on the Internet | Internet
Two decades ago, virtual communities were an essential part of the online experience 
for people using the Internet. Although these virtual communities continue to thrive, 
Web 2.0 has expanded the overall number and types of virtual communities and has 
increased their numbers dramatically. A virtual community, now more commonly called 
an online social network, provides a way for people to discuss issues and share informa-
tion using the Internet or cellular networks. People who share common interests—such 
as the high school or college they attended, the sports they watch or participate in, their 
religious preferences, their careers or jobs, or even the types of diets they follow—use 
social networks to connect to other people with similar characteristics and interests. 
Kay wants to explore the different types of Internet communication so she can share 
new ideas with her clients as they build their Internet-based business communications. 
She knows that almost all of her clients will rely on some kind of email communication 
with their customers, so she decides to investigate some of the Internet’s email-based 
communication methods first.
Email-Based Communication
In Tutorial 2, you learned how to use email to communicate with other people. You can 
also use email-based communication to access and share other information stored on 
the Web. For example, you might use email-based communication to gather ideas, con-
duct research, or contact other people who share your interests.
One way of sharing information is to join, or subscribe to, a mailing list. These mail-
ing lists are not like the ones you created in Tutorial 2, in which you grouped related 
individuals in your email program’s address book for convenience; nor are they like the 
email messages that you might request and receive from Web sites to learn more about 
a special promotion or a new product. A mailing list uses a list server to send subscrib-
ers messages from other list members. Once popular for exchanging ideas on many 
subjects, mailing lists today are used primarily to share information about very specific 
subjects, such as software testing and product development. Each person who wants to 
join a mailing list is responsible for subscribing to the list by sending an email message 
to the list’s administrative address or by using a Web site to request to be added to the 
list. A mailing list might be moderated, in which case an individual or group called the 
list moderator monitors messages sent to the list and discards inappropriate content; this 
type of list is called a moderated list. A mailing list that does not have a list moderator is 
called an unmoderated list. When a mailing list has a list administrator who oversees the 
list’s members, the list is called a closed list. When anyone can subscribe to a mailing 
list, it is called an open list.
Another email-based communication is the Usenet News Service, or Usenet, which 
was founded in 1979 at Duke University as a way of collecting information and storing it 
by topic category. Usenet was one of the first large, distributed information databases in 
the world. A distributed database is stored in multiple physical locations, with portions 
of the database replicated in different locations. The original Usenet News Service was 
devoted to transmitting computing news and facilitating discussions among employees of 
university computing departments on topics such as operating systems and programming 
languages. The topic categories on Usenet originally were called newsgroups or forums. 
Many people still use these terms when they refer to Usenet categories, but another 
popular term is Internet discussion group. Most of these newsgroups are available to the 
general public; however, some newsgroups are limited to users at a specific site or to 
those affiliated with a particular organization.
Newsgroups are similar to mailing lists in that they accept messages from users and 
make them generally available to other users. However, newsgroups do not use a list 
server to forward copies of submitted messages to subscribers. The server that stores 
a newsgroup is called a news server; the collection of news servers connected to the 
A list server runs email list 
software to manage the 
functions of a mailing list.

Internet | Tutorial 5 User-Generated Content on the Internet
Internet make up Usenet. Organizations that operate news servers include most ISPs, uni-
versities, large businesses, government units, and other entities connected to the Internet. 
A newsgroup stores items on a server as articles or postings that are sorted by topic. 
Users pull the content they need to their computers in the form of articles posted to the 
newsgroup. Users can simply read these articles, or they can optionally reply to them. 
When the Usenet News Service began operating in 1979, the only way to read or post 
articles to newsgroups was to install and run a software program, called a newsreader, 
that could manage and display the articles. Later, email programs included features that 
managed the articles. Now, you can easily search and read newsgroup articles by using 
a Web site that archives articles, such as the Google Groups directory. Google Groups 
stores millions of newsgroup articles dating from 1981 in its database. Figure 5-1 shows 
the Google Groups home page.
You can search the Google Groups directory by typing keywords in the search box, or 
you can click the general group categories to open a list of subcategories, which often 
lead to additional subcategories. As you drill down through the categories, you’ll find 
a page with the individual groups. The summary for each group includes a hyperlinked 
group name, a brief summary paragraph with the group’s focus and content, and often 
a note about the number of members in the group and the number of messages per 
month the group generates. To read the messages in a specific group, click the group’s 
hyperlink. 
Keep in mind that most groups are unmoderated; as a result, many groups contain a 
large number of off-topic threads, including messages that contain advertisements for 
unrelated products and services and messages about other topics. Unfortunately, many 
postings are potentially offensive to some readers. In an unmoderated list, there is no 
moderator to handle the disposition of objectionable material, so you must assume that 
job yourself.
In a mailing list or a news-
group, a series of postings 
on a particular issue is 
called a thread.

INSIGHT
Protecting Your Online Privacy
Joining a mailing list or newsgroup often requires you to identify yourself on a regis-
tration page before the site accepts your membership. You should consider carefully 
whether to provide detailed personal information when you register because most 
current laws do not require a Web site administrator to maintain the confidentiality of 
your information. In addition, your email address or your user name at the site might 
reveal some part or all of your entire identity. In a mailing list, messages that you send 
to the list are forwarded by the list server to everyone who has subscribed to the list. In 
some cases, your identity includes your name, location, email address, and other details 
about you. To protect your privacy, you should consider deleting your signature from 
email messages you post to a mailing list and using a Web-based email account (such 
as Yahoo! or Windows Live Hotmail) that does not include your name when you register 
for different sites. This way, you protect your “real” email address and your privacy.
Getting Information from RSS Feeds
Usenet is just one example of a feed (also commonly called a newsfeed or a Web feed) 
that uses pull technology to deliver changing content to users. This changing content might 
be from a blog, a Web site, or a news organization. The format that is used to syndicate 
(distribute) published content from one site to another is called RSS, an acronym for Really 
Simple Syndication; another format is Atom. Both RSS and Atom make it possible for com-
puters to share updates. Feeds are similar to newsgroups in that they let you subscribe to 
content that you want to receive on your device. However, feeds differ from newsgroups 
because of the way that content is delivered to subscribers. Newsgroup postings are deliv-
ered via email messages, whereas feeds are delivered through a program that includes a 
summary and a link to the published or actual content, depending on how you choose to 
receive it.
Feeds are also used by organizations and individuals that create and maintain blogs, 
and on social networking sites as a way to publish content and alert subscribers to 
changes in the content.
As you learned in Tutorial 4, to receive feed content, you can install a program called 
an aggregator on your device. An aggregator is similar to an email program in that it 
requests content from feeds to which you have subscribed and displays that content in a 
format similar to an email message. Most Web browsers, email programs, and social net-
working sites have built-in aggregators that let you subscribe to, view, and remove feeds. 
Most Web sites that syndicate content also include built-in aggregators that you can use 
to search for, subscribe to, and view syndicated content using any Web browser.
To subscribe to a feed with content that you would like to view, you can use a feed 
directory to find a source. However, a more common method is to use the tools provided 
on the Web site that includes the feed. Web sites that include feeds will display a small, 
orange RSS or Atom icon that you can click to subscribe to the feed. Sometimes the link 
to subscribe to feeds is a text link with the letters “RSS” to indicate the file format of 
the syndicated content. Figure 5-2 shows a page from MedlinePlus, a site that includes 
feeds. In Internet Explorer, the Feeds button on the Command bar changes color from 
gray to orange when the site includes syndicated content. Clicking the arrow on the 
orange Feeds button opens a menu that identifies the feeds on the page by name; click-
ing a feed name opens a new page that displays the feed’s content. 
When only part of a Web 
page is coded to syndicate 
content, such as a sports 
score or a weather update, 
you can subscribe to it 
using a Web Slice (Internet 
Explorer) or a Webchunk 
(Firefox).

Although Kay’s personal business strategy doesn’t include podcasts, she decides to 
investigate podcasting to see if it might be a useful technology for clients who want to 
provide recordings or videos on their social networking sites.
Podcasting
As you learned in Tutorial 4, MP3 is a compressed digital audio file format that greatly 
reduces the file size of an audio file without sacrificing the clarity of its content. When 
the MP3 file format became popular in the early 1990s, many people began purchasing 
MP3 players, which are portable devices that play MP3 files. Now, most cell phones and 
many other types of devices can play audio and video files.
At the same time that these types of devices became affordable and readily accessi-
ble, people who knew how to make different types of technology work on these devices 
found new uses for them. In the early 2000s, a group of programmers created the techni-
cal specifications necessary to encode audio recordings in feeds. Soon after, they worked 
toward the goal of being able to synchronize and encode audio files in feeds, which led 
to the development of podcasting in 2004. Podcasting lets a user subscribe to an audio 
or video feed, and then listen to it or watch it at the user’s convenience on a compatible 
device, which might include the user’s computer, or a mobile device such as an iPod or 
a cell phone. 
Podcasting’s original use was to make it easy for people to create and broadcast their 
own radio shows, but many other uses soon followed. Podcasts are used by the media 
to store and disseminate interviews with politicians and professors on specific subjects; 
by colleges and universities to record lectures for distance learning classes; and by 
movie studios to promote new movie releases. Some podcasts have different names that 
further identify the type of content they contain, such as a Godcast to denote a religious 
broadcast, a vidcast to identify a video feed, or a learncast to identify content that is 
educational in nature, such as a podcast produced by a university or other educational 
institution.
Although you can play a podcast using a media player, such as Windows Media 
Player or Apple’s QuickTime, you will need to use software to subscribe to a podcast. 
This software, called a podcatcher, manages the schedule for downloading files to your 
device. When you connect your device to the Internet, the podcatcher will automatically 
download subscribed podcasts to your device so you can play them later. 
The word “podcast” is a 
combination of the words 
“iPod” and “broadcast-
ing,” but you can play a 
podcast on any device 
with a media player.

sense of the type of information a podcast might include and its format. One of her cli-
ents, a small hospital, is considering including interviews with doctors, who will discuss 
basic medical conditions, on its social networking site. Kay might advise the hospital to 
produce podcasts to push content to patients, so she will examine podcasting next.
To explore podcast directories:
◗	
1.	 On the Weblinks page for Session 5.1, click one of the links in the Podcast 
Directories section. Figure 5-7 shows the Podcast Directory page for 
LearnOutLoud.com, a site that stores audio and video podcasts on hundreds of 
subjects that are geared toward personal and professional education and devel-
opment. You can search for podcasts by using the search box or by navigating 
the different podcast categories.
Many instructors record 
their lectures and make 
them available as podcasts 
for students who miss class.

physician) in the site’s search box, to explore the different categories of medical 
podcasts. As you are reviewing the podcasts, also note the dates of the broad-
casts. You will probably notice that the broadcast dates are very recent, with some 
occurring on the day of or within a few days of completing this step. Because the 
podcasts are recent, the information they contain is current. Some sites provide 
archives of past podcasts that become a source for online research.

Podcasts might be an interesting way for the physicians at the hospital to push gen-
eral health information to their patients. Kay also represents a group of local real estate 
agents, who might be interested in another technology in which the content of two or 
more Web sites is combined into a single site. She decides to review this type of site next.
Mashups
When your computer runs a certain operating system, such as Windows 7, and you 
install software programs on that computer, the operating system and the software pro-
grams communicate with each other to handle specific tasks such as displaying content 
on the screen or printing. A software program uses an application programming interface 
(API) to communicate with an operating system or some other program. 
An API is written by a programmer or developer with a specific goal in mind, such as 
displaying content on a screen or accessing a file system. When programs are developed 
for a specific operating system, developers might reference an API used by the operat-
ing system to print a document or display it on the screen, instead of writing the content 
themselves. APIs reduce the amount of coding for third-party software programs and 
ensure that the programs work together well. 
The developers of most operating systems write new APIs and make them available 
to third-party developers by request. This relationship between developers wasn’t always 
easy because the operating system developers often didn’t give third-party developers 
what they needed to run their own programs. In addition, sometimes the APIs from one 
developer were not made available to other developers, and vice versa, so data was not 
shared between companies.
Instead of keeping data to itself, a company such as eBay or Amazon.com writes an 
API and makes it available to any developer who wants to use it—usually for free. When 
APIs are shared in this way, the term Web services describes the process of organiza-
tions communicating through a network to share data without needing extensive knowl-
edge of each other’s systems. As more companies make their APIs available, developers 
can use them to enhance their own sites by combining content from two or more sites. 
Amazon.com was the first to make APIs available to other developers, who in turn used 
them to link to and integrate their content with the Amazon.com Web site.
When Web content is combined in this way, the new Web site is called a mashup. 
In a mashup, a developer combines the services from two (or more) different sites using 
APIs to create a completely new site that uses features from each site. Some examples 
of mashups are sites that combine the “25 best companies to work for” feature from 
Fortune Magazine with an API from Google Maps that produces a map with locations of 
the companies; or a list of apartments available on craigslist for rent in a specific city that

uses an API from Yahoo! to plot the apartments on a map with details about the apart-
ments, such as the square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the monthly rent. 
Figure 5-8 shows a site that combines an interactive map of the Las Vegas Strip from the 
Google Maps API with several APIs from social networking sites that provide user com-
ments and user-posted photos and videos, along with pricing information from the individ-
ual hotels in the area, such as Caesars Palace. The resulting Web site combines all of this 
data for the user to make it very easy to find a hotel to stay at while visiting Las Vegas.

Kay realizes that a mashup might be very useful for her real estate client, so she 
decides to review a mashup site next to see how it works. She is going to Boston next 
week for a conference, so she decides to use a mashup site to calculate the cost of taking 
a taxi from the conference center to the airport.
To view a mashup site:
◗	
1.	 In the Mashups section of the Weblinks page for Session 5.1, click the TaxiWiz link 
to open the TaxiWiz home page. This site lets you calculate the cost and distance of 
taking a cab from one location to another in different cities. The first thing you need 
to do is identify the city you are visiting. You’ll use Boston, MA, as the city, and cal-
culate the estimated fare to take a taxi from the Prudential Center to Logan Airport.
◗	
2.	 Click the Select City arrow, and then click Boston in the list. This sets Boston as 
the city and adds common starting points and destinations to the menus on the 
site to make it easy for users to use the site.
Trouble?  The TaxiWiz site might change over time, in which case you might use 
different tools to select your starting point and destination. If the site changes, 
use the Taxi Tips tab or link to review the current instructions, and then run the 
requested search as identified in the steps.
Trouble?  If the TaxiWiz site is no longer available, return to the Weblinks page for 
Session 5.1 and click a link in the Mashups section to visit another site. Use the tools 
on the site you select to explore the features of a mashup site and skip to Step 7.
◗	
3.	 Click the Starting point arrow, and then click Prudential Center in the list.
◗	
4.	 Click the Destination arrow, and then click Logan Airport in the list.
◗	
5.	 Click the Go! button to submit your request. Figure 5-9 shows the page from 
TaxiWiz with the results of your search. This page uses Google APIs to combine a 
page displaying a map of Boston, MA, and the estimated route and fare for tak-
ing a taxi from the Prudential Center to Logan Airport after entering these loca-
tions into the site’s form. The site generates a page that shows a map of Boston 
with an overlay of the route the taxi might take to arrive at the entered destina-
tion from the entered starting point, and an estimate of the fare the user might 
incur for the service. In addition, Google’s AdSense API displays links to services 
that might interest the user, such as links to limo services in different cities.

You might wonder how a mashup is profitable to its developer. The developer usually 
includes additional APIs on the mashup site that link to Google AdSense or other content 
that generates revenue through customized advertising on the site, similar to the ads dis-
played on the right side of the TaxiWiz page in Figure 5-9. The mashup’s developer most 
likely has an agreement with Google AdSense or another API provider to display this 
advertising and to share the income generated by users who click the links to these ads. 
Because mashups rely on Web site data that already exists and APIs that are created 
by other companies, developers with the necessary programming background find mash-
ups to be relatively easy to create and maintain, and profitable for the efforts needed to 
create them. For this reason, mashups constitute one of the fastest growing segments of 
Web sites on the Internet.
Kay wonders where she can get more information about APIs that she can use to 
generate new content that might be useful to her clients. Some Web sites list APIs by 
category, and include descriptions of the APIs and links to sites that use them. Because 
all of her clients rely on social networks, Kay wants to examine the APIs available for 
integrating social networking.
To view APIs available on the Web:
◗	
1.	 In the Session 5.1 section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 5, click the 
ProgrammableWeb.com link. Figure 5-10 shows the home page, which contains 
a variety of information about API resources. The site also provides a directory of 
available APIs that you can search by API category or by using keywords.

2.	 Near the top of the page, point to or click the API Directory link, and then click 
the APIs By Category link or the By Category link. The Web Services Directory 
page displays options for filtering the directory to find specific APIs.
◗	
3.	 In the Hide Filters section, click the Category arrow, scroll down the menu and 
click Social, and then click the Filter This List button. The filter displays APIs for 
the Social category. These APIs are used by developers to integrate the services 
from social networks with other Web sites. For example, you might use an API 
that displays the contacts from a social network with an API that displays a map 
so a user can locate a contact geographically.
◗	
4.	 Scroll down the page and review some of the APIs and their descriptions in the 
Social category. Because this list is updated daily as new APIs are added by the 
contributing sites, the list changes frequently. Next you will search for mashup sites.
◗	
5.	 Point to or click the Mashups link near the top of the page, and then click the 
Mashup Tag Cloud link or the Tag Cloud link. As developers add APIs to the 
site, they code them with keywords, called tags, that identify their use in a way 
that categorizes them. When used in the context of APIs or Web sites, a tag 
is something that a person uses to categorize a Web site, photo, post, video, 
or almost any other form of Web content based on the information it contains. 
Figure 5-11 shows a tag cloud, with all the tags that describe the different 
APIs or mashups uploaded to this site shown in an alphabetical list and a cloud 
arrangement. Larger words in the cloud indicate more APIs and mashups in that 
category. Pointing at a word in the tag cloud displays a ScreenTip that indicates 
the number of APIs and mashups associated with the tag. This feature gives you 
an idea of the relative popularity of each API or mashup category, and lets you 
search for all the related APIs and mashups quickly by clicking the tag that identi-
fies the content you are searching for.

Problem Solving: How to Ensure Effective Collaboration with a Virtual Team
Many push and pull technologies make it possible for members of a virtual team to be 
physically separated but able to work as if everyone is in the same room. Some of the tech-
nologies you learned about in Session 5.1, and the technologies you will learn about in 
Session 5.2, are used by virtual teams to collaborate on projects such as market research, 
product development, advertising and marketing campaigns, and sales presentations.
Virtual teams often must work rapidly to accomplish tasks, so identifying which tech-
nologies team members should use to collaborate on projects is critical. For example, 
when collaborating on a PowerPoint presentation, the team leader must determine the 
best method for team members to share the file. For example, will they use email to 
exchange copies of the file, or will they use another method? Will routine communication 
and updates be conducted by email or using another method? How will team members 
handle urgent communication? The decision to use one technology over another has many 
considerations, such as ensuring that the technology is cost effective, private, and avail-
able to everyone on the team, and that all team members are proficient at using it. The 
leader may change as well, depending on the stage of work the team is completing, so the 
method of communication must be one in which the person leading the group can take it 
over quickly and easily.
To ensure that your virtual team is successful, decide which communication technologies 
the team will use to keep the flow of information moving smoothly, and then reevaluate 
your choices periodically to verify that the technology is complementing and enhancing 
the work of the team.
In the next session, you will learn about push technologies.

Internet Chat Communication
Until now, you have learned about Internet communication methods that let users pull 
information to their devices when they want it. You can also use the Internet to push 
information to users. Some of these communication methods are older and being used 
less frequently as new technologies take their places, but their history is important to 
understanding the evolution of more current methods.
Originally, the term “chat” described the act of users exchanging typed messages, or 
a text chat. The early networks that became the Internet included many computers that 
ran a program called Talk that allowed users to exchange short text messages. In 1988, 
Jarkko Oikarinen wrote a communications program that extended the capabilities of the 
Talk program for his employer, the University of Oulu in Finland. He called his multiuser 
program Internet Relay Chat (IRC). By 1991, IRC was running on more than 100 serv-
ers throughout the world. IRC became popular among scientists and academicians for 
conducting informal discussions about experiments and theories with colleagues at other 
universities and research institutes. IRC is still widely used today around the world.
In addition to text-only chats, people in the 1990s used their Web browsers to visit a 
virtual chat room, where they could send text-only messages to other users in the room 
or just read the messages without contributing to the discussion. (The practice of reading 
messages and not contributing to the discussion is called lurking.) These types of sites 
still exist; today, however, chats can involve exchanging pictures, videos, sounds, data, 
and programs using a variety of technologies and methods. Some chat software lets you 
give control of your computer to another user so that person can use your programs or 
troubleshoot a problem that you are having. You can also use chat to collaborate with 
another user on a file as you talk to each other. Users with a sound card, speakers, and a 
microphone connected to their computers can participate in a voice chat, in which par-
ticipants speak to each other in real time, much like they would using a telephone. The 
addition of a Web camera (also called a webcam) enables users to participate in a video 
chat, in which participants can see and speak to each other.
Different types of chat programs can be used to participate in an Internet chat. The 
chat program you choose and the type of chat you have (text, voice, or video) depend 
primarily on the software and hardware that you and other users have installed on your 
computers, your Internet connection types, and the conversation you plan to have 
(public or private). Some chat types require specific chat software and a connection to a 
specific server.
Instant messaging software lets users chat in real time using an Internet-connected 
device. The first instant messaging program, ICQ (pronounced “I seek you”), started in 
1996 and still has millions of worldwide users. Within six months of ICQ’s introduc-
tion, America Online (AOL) created its own instant messaging software called AOL 
Instant Messenger (AIM). AOL originally created AIM to allow its members to chat with 
each other, but subsequently made the software available to anyone (even those people 
without AOL accounts) for use on the Web. Soon Microsoft introduced MSN Messenger 
(called Windows Live Messenger in Windows Vista and Windows 7), Yahoo! introduced 
Yahoo! Messenger, and other portals and software vendors released their own products 
to capitalize on the continuing popularity of instant messaging. Instant messaging is now 
widely available, with built-in support on many social networking sites and other types 
of Web sites, and for many types of devices including computers and cell phones.
Most instant messaging programs are available in different versions for specific oper-
ating systems and devices, so you should select the correct version for the device on 
which you will use it. After starting the software, you sign in using your user name and 
password. Then you use the software to create or install a list of contacts.
Kay mostly communicates with her clients using email messages and phone calls, but 
some of her clients prefer to use instant messages to contact her. She decides to explore 
some popular instant messaging software programs next so she can communicate better 
with her clients. In addition, she is interested in learning how to integrate existing instant 
messaging software with social networks.
Some people use the 
term “IM’ing” when using 
instant messaging. “IM” is 
also used as a verb, as in 
“to IM a friend.”
Some instant messaging 
software programs refer  
to online contacts as  
“buddies” or “friends.”

Another type of instant message, called a text message, occurs over a cellular network 
between users who are connected to the network using cell phones or other mobile 
devices. Text messaging uses different technology than instant messaging, but its commu-
nication is very similar. Text messaging lets users send and receive very short messages 
(usually 140 characters or less) in real time.
Written Communication: The Language of Chatting
Most people using one of the many forms of chat communication take certain shortcuts in 
their written messages that they should avoid using in business communication. For a con-
versation between friends or family members, responding to a message with only the letter 
“K” might indicate the sender’s acknowledgement of a message that is requesting a certain 
action, and agreeing to complete the assigned task. This typing shortcut is fast, which is how 
most written chat conversations occur. Because of the speed at which chat participants react 
to each other’s messages, it’s not unusual to take other written shortcuts—such as not using 
capital letters, complete sentences, or proper grammar—to send your messages faster.
How you express your messages during a chat might also convey your emotional involve-
ment in the message, as well. Messages written in all capital letters have a common interpre-
tation of indicating that the sender is shouting or screaming the message for emphasis. Chat 
participants often use the same emoticons that email users find helpful to display humor and 
emotions in their messages. In addition, chat participants might use common acronyms as 
a typing shortcut for common expressions, such as “bbl” for “be back later,” “c u” for “see 
you (later),” “lol” for “laughing out loud,” “jam” for “just a minute,” and “ttfn” for “ta-ta for 
now” (or “goodbye”). 
Because chat, instant messaging, email, and texting are convenient, cost effective, 
and widely available methods of communication, most business professionals use these 
methods on their cell phones and other mobile devices to communicate with clients and 
customers. Although the previously mentioned typing shortcuts are acceptable between 
friends and family, they are never acceptable for business communication. 
The language you use when communicating in a business environment should be 
understandable without the use of any emoticons or other characters that express your 
true feelings, and should be clearly written. In addition, even though you are using a tech-
nology that is intended to convey short messages, your business communications should 
be written in complete sentences and use proper grammar. After you create a message, be 
sure to review it before sending it to make sure that a spell checker or other text correction 
feature didn’t change any of the words in your message in a way that alters their meanings. 
Voice over Internet Protocol
Some instant messaging programs include support for voice communications, using soft-
ware that lets users engage in voice conversations using their software and the required 
equipment for engaging in a voice chat. Another option for voice calls is VoIP, which is

an acronym for Voice over Internet Protocol. VoIP is frequently used as a cost-effective 
alternative to the traditional “landline” telephone service provided by residential and com-
mercial phone companies. Because VoIP providers rely on the Internet as their network 
instead of the physical communications structure required by landlines, VoIP eliminates 
monthly service fees and taxes and usually includes long-distance and international calling 
for free or for a nominal charge. Most VoIP providers, such as the Skype service shown in 
Figure 5-13, include calling features that you expect from landlines, such as caller ID, call 
forwarding, call waiting, and voice mail services. If your landline is already provided by 
your cable provider, you might already be using VoIP for your telephone service.

For business customers, VoIP is a way to reduce costs by routing voice conversations 
over existing Internet networks while at the same time providing other business services 
such as faxing, conference calls, and Web conferencing.
The primary disadvantage of VoIP is its limitations in identifying a caller’s physical 
location for emergency services (911) operators because VoIP uses an IP address instead 
of a physical location such as a person’s home address to identify a call’s origin. VoIP 
providers use Enhanced 911 service to transmit all 911 calls from their subscribers to the 
appropriate emergency services provider, along with the caller’s telephone number and 
the physical address provided by the subscriber upon initiation of the VoIP service. This 
process is slower than what you might expect from making an emergency call from a 
traditional landline. 
Kay knows that in addition to using a Web browser and other types of devices for 
chatting, she can also chat with friends from other social networks, such as Facebook.
Online Social Networks
In the past, social networks connected people with specific common interests. For exam-
ple, one of the first social networks on the Internet, Classmates.com, started in 1995 as a 
way to connect people from specific graduating classes at high schools and colleges, and 
in the military.
Another early online social network, craigslist, which was created in 1995 by Craig 
Newmark, started as an information resource for San Francisco area residents. This 
online community has expanded to include information for most major cities in the 
United States and in countries around the world. The company started as a not-for-profit 
organization but was incorporated as a for-profit company in 1999. According to the 
site’s fact sheet, craigslist retains its .org domain as a way to symbolize the relatively non-
commercial nature of the service and its noncorporate culture. This mission is evident in 
the site’s very basic design and function.
The craigslist Web site was an early pioneer, and it is still operated as a community 
service. Most of the revenue earned by craigslist comes from the 1 million job postings it 
features each month at a cost of $25 to $75 each, depending on the city in which the ad 
is placed, and brokered apartment listings in New York City. According to craigslist, more 
than 50 million people visit more than 700 craigslist sites in countries around the world 
each month.
Connecting with Friends
Another early pioneer of Web 2.0, Friendster, was launched by Jonathan Abrams in 2003 
and was an immediate sensation on the Web. In the same year, Google saw the adver-
tising potential for the online social network and offered Abrams a $30 million buyout, 
which Abrams turned down in favor of obtaining venture capital from another source. 
Members used Friendster to post profiles with information about themselves and, at 
their option, to upload their photos and videos. They could use the Friendster site to ask 
friends who were already members to link to their profiles so they could interact with 
each other by chatting and sharing pictures and other information. Members could invite 
their nonmember friends to become Friendster members, which is one reason the site 
grew so rapidly at first. At one point, Friendster had more than 120 million users; but 
as other social networking sites came online and provided new and more interactive 
features, Friendster’s popularity rapidly declined. By 2011, Friendster’s membership was 
fewer than 1 million members and it had moved its headquarters to Asia, where most of 
those members were located. In addition, Friendster discontinued its social networking 
features and changed its focus to a social gaming site.
Other social networking sites that use the same technology as Friendster have been 
enormously successful. Facebook, which began in 2004 as a closed network for college 
students and later was expanded to include high school students, was founded by Mark 
In 2011, Google launched 
its own social network, 
Google+, which is 
integrated with users’ 
Gmail accounts and other 
Google services, as a com-
petitor to Facebook.

Zuckerberg, then a student at Harvard University. After gaining new members at a rate 
three times faster than its competitors, the Facebook network was opened to anyone  
age 13 and older with an email address. 
Many social networks operate in niche markets, such as networks for people speak-
ing specific languages or living in specific geographic areas; people with certain hobbies 
and other interests; people of the same religious preference; and people who share other 
common characteristics, much like you would find in traditional peer groups. Most of 
these sites provide a directory that lists members’ locations and interests. On some sites, 
a member can offer to communicate with any other member, but the communication 
does not occur until the intended recipient approves the contact (usually after review-
ing the sender’s directory information). By gradually building up a set of connections, 
members can develop contacts within a community. Some of these social networking 
sites have proven track records for re-creating (on a much larger scale) the essence of the 
original Internet communities.
Advertising Revenues from Social Networks
Most, if not all, social networking sites rely heavily on advertising to generate the rev-
enue they need to operate. Successful social networks have not only catered to members’ 
needs, but also have had an open mind with regard to advertising and creativity. In 2003, 
Myspace, capitalizing on its large membership of people ages 16 to 34 years old, allowed 
Procter & Gamble to create a profile for singer/actress Hilary Duff that included logos and 
links to free downloads of three of her pop songs. The profile and links were surrounded 
by a marketing pitch for Procter & Gamble’s Secret Sparkle deodorant to a large number 
of people in the product’s target market. In addition to personal connections and profiles, 
many corporations now use social networks as a way of connecting with consumers by 
harvesting data in user profiles and displaying relevant advertising, garnering product feed-
back, and offering coupons and other incentives for purchasing their products and services.
Expanding on promoting products for the first time using social networks, in 2005, the 
band Arctic Monkeys made history when its first single was released without an album 
and climbed to number one on the charts in the United Kingdom. Instead of gather-
ing momentum from an album release or a tour, the band used its Myspace profile to 
“release” and publicize the single. The band used Myspace to successfully connect with 
its audience by capitalizing on the social network’s popularity, something that had never 
been done before.
Facebook is a particularly attractive site for advertisers because of its large number 
of active users—800 million and counting—and more than 50% of its users check 
their Facebook pages daily. Now the largest social network in the world, Facebook 
has become an essential communication tool for individuals and a valuable marketing 
tool for corporations: Even something as commonplace as a brand of toilet paper has 
a Facebook page. Political candidates, grassroots campaigns, television programs, and 
millions of businesses have Facebook pages that are an integral part of their marketing 
efforts. Figure 5-14 shows the Help page for Facebook; notice how many help topics 
relate to business use of this social network. 
Some industry analysts 
have estimated Facebook’s 
annual revenues to be in 
excess of $1 billion, mostly 
from advertising.

In 2011, Facebook was still a privately held company despite purchase offers from 
Yahoo! and Google. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who owns the largest share of 
Facebook, has stated that the company will remain private to fulfill its mission statement 
of providing new technologies and innovative ways to connect people in natural ways. 
However, in early 2012, there was speculation in the business community that Facebook 
would become a publicly traded company at some point in the future. The Facebook 
sign up page includes the slogan, “It’s free and always will be.” Because of the enor-
mous success of Facebook’s social network and advertising models, becoming a publicly 
traded company most likely will not change the way the Facebook site operates.
Online Business Networks
LinkedIn, a social network started in 2003 for business professionals, has more than  
135 million individual members who use the site to make connections to other profes-
sionals and companies around the world, and to build an online résumé. More than  
2 million companies around the world use the site to connect with professionals, profes-
sional networks, and other companies as a recruiting and marketing tool. LinkedIn is just 
one of many sites that focus primarily on professional networking, but it is the largest. 
Other business network sites, such as Ryze (for “rise up,” with 500,000 members) and 
Sermo (a site restricted to credentialed U.S. physicians that has more than 120,000 
members), are smaller but still connect business professionals. Users of these sites are 
usually seeking jobs, searching for potential business partners, recruiting workers, joining 
professional networks, exchanging ideas, and engaging in other business development 
and career activities.

Tutorial 5 User-Generated Content on the Internet | Internet
Users of online business networks are not looking to build social connections to users 
like those on Facebook. Online business networks are used by people and organizations 
that are looking for specific business solutions, such as a company recruiting employees 
with specific skills, a vendor hoping to place its product in a particular retail outlet, or an 
organization searching for a consultant who can provide assistance on a specific topic. 
Online business networks tend to use categories that reflect these specific interests and 
try to make it easy for businesspeople to find the connections they need as quickly and 
efficiently as possible. Figure 5-15 shows the “What is LinkedIn?” page, which illustrates 
the ways that the LinkedIn site connects its users.
As part of promoting her business, Kay uses a LinkedIn account to connect to col-
leagues and clients. She hasn’t explored the part of the LinkedIn site that lets users ask 
and answer questions, so she decides to view those pages next.

Kay has several clients that will need to share pictures of items such as homes for 
sale, custom-designed jewelry, and company-sponsored events on their Web sites. She 
decides to explore sites that allow users to post and share pictures on the Web.
Sharing Pictures on the Web
As digital cameras became less expensive and more capable of producing extremely 
high-quality photos, many companies that provided photo-processing services, such as 
drugstores, began to change their offerings. They started allowing consumers to upload 
their digital images to a Web site and print photographs, and to purchase items sold by 
the site (such as coffee cups, mouse pads, and t-shirts) imprinted with those images. 
Eventually, new sites on the Web started offering these same services plus enhanced 
tools that made it easy for users to upload pictures and create more complex items, such 
as calendars and Web galleries. These sites, such as Shutterfly and Snapfish, let users 
upload pictures and print them in different ways, and also let users share their pictures 
with other users. Some sites, such as Flickr, have evolved even further and now let users 
tag images by category or person and share these photos as part of the Flickr social net-
work or with other social networks, such as Facebook.
These sites, generally called photo-sharing sites, enable users to become part of a 
community by uploading their images from a digital camera or from a mobile device, 
and then posting them for other users to see. In many of these sites, users can add photos 
uploaded to a photo-sharing site and transfer them to their Facebook page or to their 
blog to share them with their existing networks of friends. Many of these sites let users 
post photos for free, up to a certain online storage limit. In this case, the site might be 
supported by advertisements that target users based on the content of the photographs 
they upload; other sites impose fees for all users.
Sharing photos on the Web can be done privately or publicly, depending on your 
goal. Almost every site includes features that let you post photos and restrict who can 
view them by sending invitations to view your gallery through email messages to autho-
rized users. Other sites let you post your photos and make them available to any user.
Kay decides to explore the Flickr site next so that she will be prepared to discuss the 
functionality of a photo-sharing site with clients that will share different types of photos 
with their customers.

2.	 Scroll down the page and examine its contents. Notice the photo gallery that 
appears on the page; click any image in the gallery that interests you. The page 
that opens will display the full-sized image along with details about the image, 
such as the photographer’s name, where and when the photo was taken, and a 
caption describing the image. If the image has been posted long enough, you 
might see feedback about the image from other Flickr users; it is this interaction 
with other users that creates a social network. In addition, you might see tags that 
assign categories to the photo. Clicking one of these tags will open another page 
of photos related to that category. As users find images that interest them, they 
can create connections to the photographers of those images and make them 
part of their social network.

3.	 Click your browser’s Back button to return to the Flickr home page, and then 
click another picture in the gallery and explore the page that opens to learn more 
about the photograph. When you have finished, return to the Flickr home page.

Weblinks page for Session 5.2 and click a link to another site in the Photo-Sharing 
Sites section until you find a site with a tour or another feature that explains how 
the site works. 
◗	
5.	 Follow the on-screen steps to take the tour, being sure to read the content on 
each page. Pay particular attention to the site’s privacy settings for photographs; 
how to integrate the images with other social networks, such as Twitter and 
Facebook; and how to create blogs and groups from your photos.

Kay likes the features that the photo-sharing site provides and predicts that she might 
find creative ways for her clients to use this site. Another social network that might inter-
est her clients is YouTube, which is an online social network for sharing videos. 
Sharing Videos on the Web
Similar to photo-sharing sites, where users post photos to share with other users, a 
video-sharing site lets users post video content. These videos might be short clips shot 
from someone’s cell phone, or professionally produced movie trailers, news segments, 
or interviews. The most popular video-sharing site, YouTube, started in 2005 as a private 
venture; only a year later, Google purchased it for $1.65 billion. By 2011, YouTube had 
more than 2 billion visitors posting and watching hundreds of millions of videos each 
day. As the site became more popular and more integrated with other online social net-
works, corporations began sponsoring pages and uploading their own material, includ-
ing commercials, corporate news, product tours, and even political ads and rallies. 
YouTube is now the primary place where people post and watch video content on 
the Web. You don’t need to visit the YouTube Web site to view its content; many compa-
nies embed links to content that they have posted on YouTube, and program those links 
to open a new window and a media player on your device to play the video content

directly from their Web page. For example, Figure 5-17 shows a video playing on the 
MindTap About Us page. This video, produced by Cengage Learning, includes an expla-
nation of the company’s philosophy and innovations in textbook publishing. Cengage 
Learning also posted this video to its accounts on other social networking sites, including 
Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, and included links to these sites on the page so visitors 
can easily view MindTap content on these other sites.
 
Although YouTube is the most popular and active video-sharing site on the Internet, 
most other portals, such as Yahoo! and Bing, also include dedicated sites where users 
can post and share videos. In some cases, you’ll find the same video posted on multiple 
sites, and also on the owner’s site. For example, the video that appears in Figure 5-17 
also appears on YouTube.
When YouTube first started, it was immediately popular with people who were already 
participating in well-established social networks. Word of mouth traveled quickly, and 
users began uploading and sharing video content on YouTube. The site didn’t really need 
to advertise itself: Its innovative approach became a social network of its own, and the 
people using YouTube were quick and eager to pass it on. YouTube now has strategic 
partnerships with many major television and cable networks and music labels to broad-
cast their content. In addition to these partnerships, YouTube relies heavily on display 
ad placement, brand channels (advertising focused on a specific brand), and contests to 
generate revenue.

INSIGHT
Effectively Searching Video-Sharing Sites
Aside from users posting videos of their pets doing tricks or something funny, ama-
teur athletic events, world events, or other human interest stories, YouTube and other 
sites that let users post video content are also a repository for millions of commercially 
uploaded segments, such as professional sporting events, movie trailers, unaired alter-
nate endings for television shows, news broadcast segments, commercials, and semi-
nars by corporations and individuals. The videos you’ll find on these sites range from 
low-quality videos shot with a cell phone camera to commercial-quality, high definition, 
professionally produced segments. 
Depending on your reason for visiting a video-sharing site, you might find some-
thing that makes you laugh, or find videos to supplement or begin a research project 
or to increase your knowledge about a specific topic. Most video-sharing sites let users 
tag content, which makes it easy to find video content related to research projects or 
specific subjects. In addition, these sites include search tools that let you search for 
video content with keywords or by browsing categories, much like you would search for 
a podcast or blog.
When viewing content on a video-sharing site, you need to use the same skills you 
learned in Tutorial 3 to properly investigate the site’s source and creator so you can 
evaluate its credibility. Most video-sharing sites include categories that let users add 
their videos to channels, some of which include titles such as “Science & Technology” 
or “Politics and Current Events.” Depending on the source of these videos, they might 
contain information that you can deem reliable.
You can visit the Web sites for YouTube and other video-sharing sites by using the 
links in the Video-Sharing Sites section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 5.
Blogs
As you learned in Tutorial 4, a blog is a Web site that is published to express the blog-
ger’s opinions about a particular topic. The blog’s author, usually a person or a specific 
organization, often invites the blog’s readers to add comments to the blog entries. A blog 
might chronicle a person’s life or adventures and become an online personal journal, 
or it might function as a forum to communicate political, religious, or other opinions of 
groups of people. Some blogs function much like news organizations by disseminating 
information about a specific story or from a specific organization. A blog might contain 
only text and comments, but it usually includes photographs, links, videos, and other 
content, and lets readers integrate the blog content they are viewing into their own social 
networks by clicking buttons for Facebook, email, and other social networks. 
Figure 5-18 shows a page from the official blog of the Federal Communications 
Commission, an agency that regulates interstate and international radio, television, wire, 
satellite, and cable communication in the United States. Notice that the blog includes 
tools that the blog’s reader can use to repost the blog’s content on other social networks. 
Clicking the Facebook share link, for example, lets a reader log in to a Facebook account 
and post the blog’s content on the reader’s Facebook page, thus sharing the content with 
other communities.

Many blogs are published using free blogging tools available from sites such as 
Blogger, WordPress, and Windows Live Writer to publish content to the author’s own 
Web site or to a subdomain on the host’s Web site. These blogging tools often include 
templates that format the blog’s content and provide the blog’s overall design, create a 
form to post comments, create a widget of tools to post the content on other sites, and 
provide code snippets to create hyperlinks and embed photos in the postings. As post-
ings are added to the blog, they appear at the top of the comments section, with older

postings appearing below the newer ones. This chronological method of posting is com-
mon to most blogs. Most blogging tools today include features that let the blog’s author 
update the blog’s content from a mobile device, making it possible for the blog’s content 
to be updated constantly. You can use the links in the Blogs section on the Weblinks 
page for Tutorial 5 to visit different blogging sites.
Because anyone can write a blog, there are millions of them on the Internet. Some 
are from reporters working for well-known news organizations such as The New York 
Times, CNN, ZDNet, Reuters, and local newspapers in many U.S. markets. Other blogs 
are written by individuals who might not claim any affiliation to an organization. When 
searching for blogs, you should use the skills you learned in Tutorial 3 to evaluate the 
resources a blog contains and the credentials of its authors. Just like any other Web site, 
a blog might contain inaccurate or inappropriate information. Fortunately, it is easy to

Microblogs
The popularity of using blogs to create an online personal journal, combined with the 
proliferation of Internet-connected devices, resulted in a new type of blog called a 
microblog. A microblog is a form of blogging that sends short messages—usually  
140 characters or less—on a very frequent schedule. Whereas a blogger might spend 
hours updating his or her blog daily, weekly, or monthly with long posts that include 
text, photos, and links, a microblogger might update his or her content hourly or even 
more frequently using just a few words or a single sentence. The content of a microblog 
differs from that of a traditional blog in that it answers the question, “What are you doing?” 
A microblogger might send one sentence or a few words to describe what’s going on in his 
or her life at that exact moment, whereas a blogger might take several hours to describe a 
vacation or express an opinion. 
Microblog postings are sometimes called tweets, and the act of microblogging is 
sometimes called tweeting; both terms are references to the popular microblog Web site, 
Twitter. The Twitter page for CengageBrain, a companion site for this textbook’s publisher, 
is shown in Figure 5-20.

To post content using a microblog such as Twitter, you need to create an account. To 
read the content of someone else’s microblog, you choose the option to follow that per-
son’s or organization’s account. In microblogging, the term follower identifies a person 
or an organization who is receiving your updates. You don’t need to create an account to 
view someone else’s postings; you can simply go to the microblog’s Web site and find his 
or her page of postings and read it. However, if you already have an account, you can 
become a follower, in which case the updates appear in your microblog account as soon 
as they are posted by other users. You might receive content through your account on the 
microblog Web page, or via instant or text messages on a wireless device. 
Because many people use cell phones to post and receive content on their microblogs, 
and messages are usually limited to fewer than 140 characters, many microbloggers use 
the same text message acronyms that you find in instant messages. Just like in a blog, as 
you post content, it might be read by your friends or by people you don’t know. It is this 
act of following people on a microblog that makes it social.
Postings on a microblog site, such as the Twitter site shown in Figure 5-20, show up 
as individual messages. The person or organization that posted the message appears in 
bold; in Figure 5-20, the postings are all by the user named “CengageBrain.” The post-
ings are all very short, concise messages. Some of the postings include an embedded

link to a photo or video; these links are shown in red and, when clicked, load the photo 
or other embedded content on the user’s device. Notice that the link name is just a gen-
erated link and not a URL to a site or photo. 
In addition, users include user-defined keywords called hashtags to create topical cat-
egories that link to other messages with the same hashtags. For example, in Figure 5-20, 
the hashtags #professor, #technology, and #currentevents in the first, second, and third 
messages indicate that the author is linking messages to other messages on the Twitter 
network related to these categories. Clicking a hashtag provides a listing of all other 
messages that include the same hashtag to link together the messages and their authors. 
You will also find hashtags related to people’s moods (such as #bummedout to indicate 
a letdown or #soexcited for something exciting happening) or their location (such as 
#Boston). Because users can create new hashtags based on any single keyword or com-
bination of keywords (which contain more than one word, without spaces), millions of 
them appear in messages on the network. As users include messages with hashtags, their 
messages become linked together. This linking of messages and their followers, in addi-
tion to the messages themselves, creates the social network of the microblog.
Similar to the evolution of blogs, microblogs have gained popularity beyond the 
online personal journal and are now widely used for a variety of purposes. Many organi-
zations, including well-known retailers and educational institutions, now use microblogs 
to communicate with customers, students, and other types of followers. Many actors 
and politicians have Twitter accounts and use them to communicate with their follow-
ers; Twitter provides a way to interact with fans and voter bases. Some microblogs, such 
as Yammer, are used by companies and other organizations to provide a private social 
network for employees to use to communicate about work-related business by restricting 
followers to people with valid email addresses from the organization. Other microblogs 
let you create private groups that also might be suitable for business communication.
A retweet happens when 
a user forwards a message

INSIGHT
Social Media: You Can’t Always “Take It Back”
Although social media sites can have a very positive impact on the way their users interact 
with the world, they can also have a very real and very negative impact on individual 
users. According to Merriam-Webster Online, one definition of a scandal is the “loss of 
or damage to reputation caused by actual or apparent violation of morality or propriety.” 
For centuries, individuals, groups, and organizations have been victims of scandals of all 
types. In the 21st century, however, the visibility of scandals has increased dramatically 
due to the speed at which information travels over social networks and the Internet. In the 
past several years, social media have quickly communicated scandals, sometimes within 
minutes of their occurrences. For example, consider the following news stories from 2011:
• After a major earthquake and a tsunami caused billions of dollars of damage 
and resulted in the deaths of thousands of people in Japan, comedian Gilbert 
Gottfried used his Twitter account to make jokes about the disaster. A sponsor 
who used Gottfried’s voice in its advertising campaign terminated his contract 
after the incident.
• Both Congressman Christopher Lee and Congressman Anthony Weiner 
resigned from the House of Representatives after admitting to sending inap-
propriate photographs over the Internet.
Other lapses in judgment occur every day by users of social networks, but they aren’t 
as well publicized and immediately forwarded to thousands or millions of users in an 
instant. News organizations regularly report about instances in which employees dispar-
age their employers or coworkers on their personal Facebook pages, or students breach 
university rules and attest to their indiscretions with photographs posted on their Twitter 
accounts. For some people, the end result of these incidents is being fired or expelled.
The immediacy of social networks can provide important details about unfolding 
events, such as crises. But this immediate communication should be treated with the 
same respect that is found in other forums that are not electronic. Before you post 
something on a social network, you should consider the following:
• Evaluate who can access your comments. Even if you change your account 
settings to share your posts only with friends that you designate, your friends 
might forward your posts to other users. If you intend for your posts to be pri-
vate, the only way to ensure privacy is to not post them at all.
• Consider your state of mind when posting comments. A good rule is to avoid 
posting comments when you are upset or angry, and to make sure that you 
confirm your facts. Attempts at jokes might be misinterpreted or misunderstood, 
especially when the reader has no way to gauge the seriousness of your com-
ments. A comment that you posted in jest might seem real to another person. 
• Don’t say something online that you wouldn’t say in person. The isolation of 
typing comments makes some people bolder and causes them to say some-
thing that they might later regret. Before submitting or sending content, con-
sider whether you would say the same thing in exactly the same way in front of 
a large group of people in an auditorium. If you wouldn’t, then you shouldn’t 
say it online, either. 
The most important consideration when using social media is to remember that it is 
very difficult to take comments back because comments you post appear in all of your 
friend’s feeds. If you do find yourself in a situation in which you made a mistake, be 
quick to delete the offensive comment and to apologize to the parties involved.
You can use the links in the Microblogs section on the Weblinks page for Tutorial 5 to 
visit the Web sites for different microblogging sites.

Protecting Your Privacy and Identity on Social 
Networks
Social and business networks can be powerful tools for keeping in touch with friends 
and family, communicating with business associates, or locating people around the 
world who share your hobbies and interests. However, the very nature of these open 
networks can result in problems for users who are not careful about how they use them. 
When creating a profile on an online social network, consider the following:
• There is a strong likelihood that many people in the world share your same name 
and maybe even some common life details. When you contact someone as a “friend” 
through the network, you might not be contacting the correct person—you might just 
be contacting someone with the same name. Likewise, you could be contacting some-
one who is pretending to be someone else.
• Some sites have restricted areas or prohibit use for underage users; but with millions of 
users, it’s likely that some of them will be able to access restricted content simply by 
falsifying their age. Parents need to be especially diligent to monitor the use of online 
social networking by minors to protect their privacy and the material they view while 
online. In response to this and other problems associated with minors using social 
networking sites, some school districts in the United States have blocked access to 
Facebook, Twitter, and other online social networks on their school computers in an 
attempt to protect children from inappropriate content and Internet predators. Many 
corporations and large organizations, such as the Department of Defense, also block 
their computers from accessing online social networks. Many do so for the sake of 
“security,” but some admit that the blocks occur because employees waste too much 
time at work visiting these sites.
• Cyberbullying—using Internet communication such as email, text and instant messages, 
blogs, microblogs, or social networks to harass, threaten, or intimidate someone—is a 
problem usually associated with children but can involve adults as well. Most online 
social networks have codes of conduct that establish penalties for this type of behav-
ior, which should be reported immediately. In addition, the site’s Help section usually 
outlines the steps you can take to prevent cyberbullies from contacting you again and to 
report them to the network’s administration.
• Because the nature of an online social network requires you to provide real informa-
tion about yourself—your name, hometown, education, birth date, picture, and other 
personal information—and because this information you provide, by design, is made 
public, you might be putting yourself at risk for identity theft and other privacy prob-
lems. Most sites include tools that let you hide parts of your profile from other users 
until you give them permission to access your complete profile. Be sure to read the 
site’s privacy policy and change the default security settings as necessary to protect 
your privacy in a way that makes you feel comfortable and secure when using the 
site. However, keep in mind that the contacts you have on these social networks have 
access to your information, and so do all of their contacts. A member with 20 contacts 
might feel comfortable sharing personal information with those 20 contacts, but must 
be mindful of the fact that each of those 20 contacts can share your information with 
their contacts—some of whom are strangers to you.

Protecting Your Reputation
In addition to protecting your privacy and identity, it’s important to protect your reputa-
tion and control the information that you make available to the public. The information 
you post on a social network is public—and it is often archived even after you delete it. 
Many employers check Twitter, Facebook, and other online social networks for informa-
tion that you have posted about yourself. Applicants with exemplary résumés are often 
passed over for interviews when their Twitter accounts or Facebook pages show them 
acting in ways that are inappropriate for a corporate culture. 
Schools are especially careful to monitor online sites; most parents would demand 
action from school districts if they find that their child’s teacher is participating in inap-
propriate online behavior, even if that behavior is on his or her “own time.” Some univer-
sities have policies that prevent student athletes from creating profiles on Facebook and 
other sites. Although the reasons for these bans vary, one stated reason is to protect the 
privacy of athletes, some of whom travel significantly as part of their involvement in a 
student athletic program. Another stated reason is to protect the reputation of the school; 
some universities view student athletes as “ambassadors” of the university, and having 
athletes involved in inappropriate behavior documented on their online profiles could 
result in an embarrassment to the school and other athletes.
Another issue related to privacy is the use of your online profile by people in posi-
tions of authority. On several college campuses across the United States, students’ online 
profiles provided proof that they violated the code of conduct agreements that they 
signed when they became tenants of student housing. In one case, students at North 
Carolina State University took pictures of themselves in a dorm room while consuming 
alcohol. One of the students posted pictures of the party on his Facebook page. When a 
university official found the pictures, they became proof of the violation to the student 
housing contract and proof of the students’ underage drinking. In similar cases on other 
college campuses, the students were suspended. At some schools, students regarded this 
lurking by university officials on online sites as an invasion of privacy. Other schools 
have updated their codes of conduct to specifically authorize the monitoring of students’ 
online profiles as a legal way of taking action against a student when inappropriate or 
illegal behavior is proven with information students post on their profiles.
Unfortunately, sometimes the online content that is posted about a specific person or 
a business might not be true, resulting in damage to his or her online reputation, or the 
information might be true and cause problems with job applications or required back-
ground screenings for different reasons. When the information posted is not true, you 
might need to employ the services of a reputation management firm to help remove it. 
These types of businesses are becoming more prevalent on the Internet as a way to help 
people and organizations monitor their online reputation and, when necessary, work 
to clear any offensive or negative content from online social networks, blogs, and other 
sites. ReputationDefender, a product of one such company that specializes in online 
reputation management, is shown in Figure 5-21. You can explore this site and other 
online reputation management firms by clicking the links in the Monitoring Your Online 
Reputation section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 5.

Review Assignments
There are no Data Files needed for the Review Assignments.
Shilling Social Media has just been hired by the local school district’s board of trustees 
to help identify how the district can use social media to improve communication with 
students and parents. The district has a Web site and in the past has relied on it to com-
municate information about important school events, school board elections, and other 
important district information. Last year, several natural disasters occurred during the 
school day and required immediate communication with parents, which exposed the dis-
trict’s lack of planning to facilitate an emergency communication method with parents. 
To address this problem and enhance overall communication with students and parents, 
the district wants to explore using social networks. Kay Shilling knows that electronic 
communication with minors adds a layer of complexity to any marketing campaign, so 
she needs to research the acceptable use guidelines and other rules of the sites the dis-
trict plans to use to make sure that the district operates within established legal and site 
guidelines. Complete the following steps:
 1. Start your Web browser, go to www.cengagebrain.com, open the Tutorial 5 Weblinks 
page, and then click the Review Assignments link.
 2. Click a link in the Chat & Instant Messaging section, and then explore the site to 
learn about its features, paying particular attention to the district’s communication 
needs. Determine if this site might be a good way to communicate with parents in 
general and during emergencies. Explore the site’s terms of use (or terms of service) 
and privacy policies to determine if there are any limits on minors under the age of 
18 or another specific age using the site. In a report, note your findings about this 
site in the first paragraph.
 3. Return to the Weblinks page for the Review Assignments, and then choose another 
link in the Chat & Instant Messaging section. Repeat Step 2 to evaluate this site, and 
then add your findings to the second paragraph of your report.
 4. Return to the Weblinks page for the Review Assignments, and then explore at least 
two of the sites in the Photo- & Video-Sharing Sites section. Repeat Step 2 to evalu-
ate the site, and then add your findings to the next two paragraphs of your report.
 5. Return to the Weblinks page for the Review Assignments, and then explore at least 
two of the sites in the Social Networks section. Repeat Step 2 to evaluate the site, 
and then add your findings to the next two paragraphs of your report.
 6. Close your browser.
 7. In the final paragraphs of your report, evaluate the information you found by answer-
ing the following questions and supporting your answers with details from the sites 
that you visited:
a. Which of the communication tools that you evaluated would best fulfill the 
district’s goal of enhancing general communication with parents? Which of the 
communication tools that you evaluated would best fulfill the district’s goal of 
providing a method of communicating with parents in an emergency? Why did 
you make these choices?
b. If any of the sites have policies restricting the use of the site by minors, would you 
still recommend that the district use the site to communicate? Why or why not?
c. Do any of the sites that you are recommending have features that will make it 
easy for the district to integrate its different communication strategies with other 
online sites? What are these features and which sites do they integrate with?
Practice the skills 
you learned in 
the tutorial using 
the same case 
scenario.

d. For the communication tools that you recommended in Step 7a, what kind of 
opportunities does the district have if it chooses these tools? For example, how 
could the district use a photo-sharing site or a microblog?

any networks or sites that the district should not use? Why or why not?
Case Problem 1
There are no Data Files needed for this Case Problem.
Biology II  Before Bruce Hill became a high school biology teacher, he studied and 
worked as a botanist who collected, analyzed, and studied the life cycle of plants. 
Consequently, botany is his favorite unit to teach to his high school class. A project he 
assigns asks his students to collect 30 samples of indigenous wildflowers and prepare 
a notebook that includes the plant sample, photographs of the plant in its wild state, 
the plant’s common and scientific names, and details about the plant’s habitat, growing 
cycle, and other pertinent information. Over the years, Bruce has amassed a large, per-
sonal collection of wildflowers and frequently uses his pictures to help students identify 
their own samples. During class last week, one of his students suggested that he create 
an account for the class on a Web site so the students could upload their photos and 
contribute to his collection. Bruce thinks that this is a great idea and decides to explore 
using a photo-sharing site on the Internet to collect the photos. Because of his interest 
in botany, he is also interested in connecting to other teachers who might be assigning 
similar projects, so he can expand his plant collection beyond the geographic area of his 
school. Complete the following steps:
 1. Start your Web browser, go to www.cengagebrain.com, open the Tutorial 5 Weblinks 
page, and then click the Case Problem 1 link.
 2. Click one of the links to a photo-sharing site and use the site to learn more about 
tagging photos. A good starting point is to search the site’s Help feature for the word 
“tag” or to examine the frequently asked questions page. As you are reviewing the 
information you find, note the site’s suggestions for tagging content. After you are 
finished, use the site to examine photos with tags related to botany, such as specific 
wildflower or plant names. If you need help determining your search text, use a 
search engine to find the names of flowers and plants, and then return to the photo-
sharing site to enter those names and search for them.
 3. After searching the site, review the site’s community guidelines, its terms of use, or a 
similarly named page to make sure that the site is appropriate for high school sopho-
mores who are at least 15 years old.
 4. Return to the Weblinks page for Case Problem 1, and then click another site in the 
Case Problem 1 section. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for the second site.
 5. Close your browser.
 6. In a report containing two to four paragraphs, answer the following questions:
a. Can the photo-sharing sites you visited support the use that Mr. Hill proposes, as 
explained in the introductory paragraph at the beginning of this case problem? 
Why or why not?
b. Do either of the sites you visited have restrictions that might limit the use of the 
site by high school sophomores? If so, what are these restrictions?
c. Which site do you think would be better for Mr. Hill to use? Why?
d. Do you think that Mr. Hill’s intention of connecting with other high school biol-
ogy teachers through his photos is possible? Why or why not?

in nursing. He recently finished his training and completed the licensing requirements 
to become a Certified Nurse Practitioner (CNP), with a specialty in pediatrics. As a pedi-
atric CNP, Garrett will work under a physician’s supervision to provide routine medical 
care for children under the age of 18. He worked with the university’s career services 
department before he graduated and secured a job working for a physician in Scottsdale, 
Arizona. Garrett will be relocating to Scottsdale in a few weeks, and he is interested in 
connecting with other CNPs in the area to start building a network of friends and col-
leagues who can help him with his transition to his new job and his new community. He 
asks you to help him establish these connections. Complete the following steps:
 1. Start your Web browser, go to www.cengagebrain.com, open the Tutorial 5 Weblinks 
page, and then click the Case Problem 2 link.
 2. Click one of the links to a professional network and explore the site to determine if 
the site provides specific social groups for recent college graduates in the nursing 
field. As you explore the site, evaluate the other resources the site offers and its ease 
of use. In addition, be on the lookout for links that might interest Garrett, such as 
relocation services, career advice, general advice for nursing professionals, or forums 
that let users ask questions or seek advice about nursing.
 3. Return to the Weblinks page for Case Problem 2, and then evaluate the resources at 
another site.
 4. In a report containing two to four paragraphs, describe your experiences at the sites 
and the quality of information they provide. In your report, recommend two features 
at the sites for Garrett to use to prepare for his new career, and explain your choices. 
In addition, evaluate the overall effectiveness of the sites in terms of their career-
building features.

Lakeside Police Department  Detectives at the Lakeside Police Department, which 
patrols an area outside of Chicago, Illinois, have received several calls in the past month 
from victims of identity theft. In each case, the detectives traced the initiation of the theft 
back to the user’s social networking page. As part of the department’s community educa-
tion division, detectives want to offer a course in protecting users’ privacy and identity 
on social networking sites. Because the detectives have busy caseloads, they have asked 
for your help in researching some precautions users can take. As part of your research, 
they also would like you to visit a few sites and examine their privacy controls. Complete 
the following steps:
 1. Start your Web browser, go to www.cengagebrain.com, open the Tutorial 5 Weblinks 
page, and then click the Case Problem 3 link.

Evaluating Mashup Content and Ad Placement  In this tutorial, you learned about the 
technology that combines content from two or more Web sites to create a mashup. 
Because the technology that combines mashups is relatively simple and inexpensive or 
free, new mashups are added to the Web every day. Some mashups are created as public 
services, others are created for profit. In this Case Problem, you will review two mashup 
sites and evaluate the content that they contain, the origin of that content, and the adver-
tising included on the site. Complete the following steps:
 1. Start your Web browser, go to www.cengagebrain.com, open the Tutorial 5 Weblinks 
page, and then click the Case Problem 4 link. Click one of the sites in the list.
 2. Evaluate the content on the site to determine where the data comes from. Your evalu-
ation of the source data can come from information posted on the site or from your 
analysis of the content.
 3. Note whether the site includes advertising and try to determine its source. How do 
the ads relate to the content you are viewing on the site? Do you see any ads that are 
relevant to the city or town in which your computer is connected? If so, how do you 
think that these ads were generated? If the site doesn’t include ads, does it include 
another feature that might generate revenue?
 4. Return to the Weblinks page for Case Problem 4, and then choose another site. Use 
the information provided in Steps 2 and 3 to evaluate the data and ads featured on 
the second site.

Evaluating Syndicated Information Resources  In this tutorial, you used directories 
to find information about blogs and podcasts. Almost all major newspapers and news 
organizations use blogs, podcasts, and feeds to provide information, in addition to their 
published editions and Web sites. When you are researching a specific topic, these news 
organizations can provide you with a broad range of information written by objective 
journalists, and opinions written by outside contributors and content experts. To see what 
information is available on the Web, you’ll choose a search topic that interests you and 
then evaluate the information you find. Complete the following steps:
 1. Start your Web browser, go to www.cengagebrain.com, open the Tutorial 5 Weblinks 
page, and then click the Case Problem 5 link.
 2. Click a link to a feed, podcast, or blog resource. Review the site’s content and find 
a category of information that interests you. For example, you might choose to 
explore health, sports, science, or Internet topics. Do not subscribe to anything, but 
use the links to the content to see the articles and postings available for a category. 
For example, clicking a health category might open a page with articles or postings 
about health topics. Review the material that you find and evaluate it to see if it ful-
fills your information needs. Click the individual links to open the postings so you 
can read them directly. If the content is not what you need, return to the categorical 
listing and choose another topic until you find one that you like.
 3. Use the Web pages where the content is posted to evaluate the source of the post-
ings. For several articles, note the author and the date the content was published, 
and then read a few paragraphs of each article to get a sense of whether the content 
expresses the author’s opinion or contains objective reporting.
 4. Return to the Weblinks page for Case Problem 5, and then click a link in the Blogs, 
Feeds, or Podcast Search section. Use the search feature of the site you selected to 
search for the same topic using the category you selected in Step 2. Use the links on 
the search results page to review a few of the sources.
 5. In a report containing two to four paragraphs, discuss the content you viewed and 
evaluate the quality of the information at the news organization using the search 
directory. What is your impression of the content you viewed at the news organiza-
tion? What is your impression of the same content you viewed using the blog, feeds, 
or podcast search directory? In your opinion, which option provides better informa-
tion? Why?

Decision Making
Evaluating Search Results
Decision making is the process of identifying, evaluating, and selecting a course of 
action in a specific situation or when solving a problem. The steps involved for making 
good decisions include the following:
 1. Obtaining relevant information
 2. Identifying possible courses of actions or solutions
 3. Selecting the best course of action
 4. Developing and implementing an action plan
 5. Monitoring the result, verifying the accuracy of the decision, and taking corrective 
action, if needed
The Internet can be a valuable resource during the decision-making process.
Step 1: Obtaining Relevant Information
Before evaluating a potential course of action for a given situation or problem, you must 
gather the data and other information you need to make a decision. This data might be 
information that you obtain from people, reports, or other sources, such as blogs, pod-
casts, newsgroups, and news feeds. All of these resources can help you to understand the 
problem you are seeking to understand and solve. 
Step 2: Identifying Possible Courses of Action or 
Solutions
After collecting information to help you solve a problem, you can identify courses of 
actions or solutions. Some decisions need to be made quickly, in which case, you must 
evaluate the information you find in a limited amount of time.
Step 3: Selecting the Best Course of Action
Once you have identified multiple courses of actions or solutions, you need decide on 
the best one. Sometimes, you might ask questions, such as:
• Which course of action make sense for the long term?
• Which course of action easily implemented, given the resources you have available?
• Are you comfortable with the course of action?

Step 4: Developing and Implementing an Action Plan
Once you have made a decision, you need to decide how to implement the necessary 
steps to put the decision into effect. You should have a pretty good idea of what the final 
outcome needs to look like in order to consider all relevant steps.
After making a decision, you can begin implementing a plan. As you complete your 
work, you can check off the required tasks as you complete them and assess your prog-
ress against the overall schedule. If you veer off schedule, you must be able to determine 
the cause of any problems and decide how to correct them.
Step 5: Monitoring Results and Verifying the Accuracy 
of the Decision
After implementing your plan, you should verify that your decision was correct and 
solved the problem you were working on. To assess the effect of the implemented plan, 
you can collect feedback from any affected parties to help you determine how well your 
solution worked.
Evaluating and Using Search Results in Decision Making 
You make decisions every day: Some are as simple as what to eat for breakfast, and 
others are more complex, such as deciding which route to take from one location to 
another. Deciding how to get from one place to another can be a surprisingly complex 
decision in a city like New York. When making a decision, you should gather relevant 
information and then evaluate it in the context of criteria you have developed for evalu-
ating that information to achieve the best decision outcome.
To decide which route is best, you will need to consider many factors, some of which 
will depend on the time of day (a taxi might be safer than the subway or walking if you 
are traveling late at night), how much time you have (are you on vacation and wanting to 
see the sights or are you late for a business meeting), and how much money you have to 
spend on this trip. You might also want to consider other factors, such as how many calo-
ries you will burn or what the environmental impact of your choice could be. 
In Tutorials 1 through 5, you learned how to locate and evaluate information on the 
Internet. When faced with a problem to solve, the Internet can be a useful tool for gath-
ering information to help you make the best decision. For example, you could use a 
Web site such as HopStop to find ways to navigate around a large city such as New York. 
The search results will provide you with many different options. For example, a search 
for directions in New York City will usually give you options to take the subway, a bus, 
a taxi, or an hourly car rental. The site will also give you specific directions for riding 
a bicycle or walking, which are often different in New York because the city has many 
one-way streets and streets that are closed to vehicular traffic.

Internet | Tutorials 1–5
When HopStop presents its directions, it will give specific information for each routing 
option, including:
• Estimated time duration (of the trip overall and for each leg of the trip)
• Walking time (even trips that use a bus or subway require walking to and from the 
station or bus stop)
• Cost (bus/subway/taxi fare or car rental fee)
• Calories burned (if you are walking)
You can use these factors to make an informed decision about which route and travel 
method to take, giving consideration to how much money you will spend, how long it 
will take you to travel, and how good you will feel after getting some exercise.
Note: Please be sure not to include any personal information of a sensitive nature in the 
documents you create to be submitted to your instructor for this exercise. Later on, you 
can update the documents with such information for your own personal use.
 1. Start your browser, and then use a search engine to find and open the HopStop Web 
site or another Web site that helps commuters determine the best transportation 
method to use when navigating New York City.
 2. Use the tools on the site to change the location to New York City.
 3. Set your starting location as the Crowne Plaza Times Square, which is located at 
1605 Broadway Avenue, Midtown, NY 10019.
 4. Set your destination as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which is located at 1000 
Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10028.
 5. Compute the transportation route using the Subway/Rail only option, the Walking 
option, and the Taxi cost/time option. Note the distance travelled and the estimated 
travel time for each option. For the Taxi cost/time option, note the estimated cab fare.
 6. Based on the following information, make a decision about how you would get from 
the Crowne Plaza Times Square hotel to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Use the 
information in this ProSkills exercise and from the HopStop site to support the steps 
you took to make your decisions for each situation described below:
a. You need to arrive at the museum in a hurry because you are meeting a friend 
there and you are running late.
b. You are on a strict budget while visiting New York City, but it is snowing and very 
cold outside.
c. It is a beautiful day and you are not in a hurry to arrive at the museum.
d. It is late at night, and you are visiting New York City for the first time.

Managing Common Security Threats
Case	|	Day-to-Day Business Solutions
After two decades of practicing law for a large firm in Chicago, 
Illinois, Fiona Day resigned her job as an attorney in favor of work-
ing independently and part-time so she could balance her career 
and her family’s needs better. Because she was no longer with a 
firm, she lost the services traditionally provided by an assistant. 
At first, Fiona was able to manage the tasks of a clerical and legal 
assistant on her own; but soon the daily clerical and research needs 
of her clients and business overwhelmed her.
From her social network connections to other self-employed indi-
viduals and small business professionals, Fiona soon recognized 
that others in her position want support in completing the same 
types of routine office tasks. She began to visualize a new strategy 
for dealing with the need for skilled, on-demand clerical and legal 
assistance. Fiona has developed a plan and business strategy for her 
own company, Day-to-Day Business Solutions, which will contract 
with highly skilled individuals who can support the business needs 
of both individuals and small businesses. She plans to leverage her 
existing contacts in the Chicago area by contracting with profes-
sionals with whom she has existing relationships to provide needed 
services to new clients looking for administrative support. She hired 
a Web site designer to produce a Web site that will describe the 
business services her company provides, accept résumés from con-
tractors who perform these services, and accept payments from new 
and existing clients for services. The Web server will also securely 
store business documents and other work products for clients.
As an attorney, Fiona’s first concern is to understand the security 
issues involved in conducting transactions using a Web site. She 
wants to protect her clients’ data and privacy, and also secure both 
the information and the integrity of the information the site sends 
and receives. As part of Fiona’s business plan, she wants to ensure 
that she has effective strategies in place to manage, control, and 
contain common threats. Fiona will use the Internet to research 
security issues and protection strategies.

Protecting assets using nonphysical means is 
called logical security. Using logical security 
techniques to protect data stored on computers 
is sometimes called computer security.
You can protect data 
against logical security 
threats by requiring users 
to enter passwords.
Vaults, safes, and fire-proof 
devices protect assets 
from different types of 
threats, such as burglaries 
and fires. Protecting assets 
using physical means is 
called physical security.
Fire alarms and fire-
proof doors are used 
to protect assets 
from physical security 
threats.
Security is broadly defined as the protection of 
assets from unauthorized access, use, alteration, 
or destruction. There are two general types of 
security: physical security and logical security.

A firewall, which might be a separate hardware device or a 
software program, protects networks and attached network 
devices by preventing unauthorized communications. 
Firewalls are an example of logical security when used 
with networks. When a firewall is a physical structure that 
protects physical assets from fires and other physical 
threats, the firewall provides physical security.
Locks and alarms are used to protect 
assets that are stored in the building 
from physical security threats.

Security Basics
“Security” is a general term that describes any method that protects physical assets, such 
as computers and servers, and logical assets, such as data, from unauthorized access, 
use, alteration, or destruction. There are two general types of security: physical security 
and logical security. The Visual Overview for Session 6.1 explains some of the devices 
that provide these two types of security to different assets. 
Any act or object that endangers an asset is known as a threat. This tutorial will focus 
on some of the common logical security threats that affect computers and data in a net-
work. Logical security threats are generally classified into three categories: secrecy, integ-
rity, and necessity. Some threats can be classified into more than one category. A secrecy 
threat occurs when data is disclosed to an unauthorized party, an integrity threat results 
in unauthorized data modification, and a necessity threat causes data delays (which 
slow down the transmission of data) or denials (which prevent data from getting to its 
correct destination). 
As technology changes and new threats emerge, individuals and organizations must 
be diligent and proactive to safeguard their assets from threats that include stolen identi-
ties, files, programs, and hard drive space; misdirected, altered, or intercepted email 
messages; or illegally obtained and used passwords that allow unauthorized access to 
protected data and services. The strategies for protecting assets from physical and logical 
security threats are collectively called countermeasures.
A countermeasure is a physical or logical procedure that recognizes, reduces, or 
eliminates a threat. Depending on the value of the asset being protected, the goal of a 
countermeasure might be to detect, deter, or eliminate a threat. For example, you might 
set a password for a computer as a way of deterring unauthorized use by people who do 
not know the password. To detect a threat, a computer might maintain a log of access 
attempts and store the IP addresses of users as a way of identifying their locations. To 
detect a threat, a computer might lock out a user who has attempted to log in more than 
three times as a way of eliminating the threat of unauthorized use.
When protecting an asset, the countermeasure that an individual or organization 
chooses often depends on the expected types of threats to that asset and its value. For 
example, you might hang your jacket on a public coat rack in a restaurant with a low 
expectation of it being stolen. However, if you store your wallet and keys in the jacket’s 
pocket, you might be less likely to hang your jacket on that same public coat rack 
because the jacket’s theft will result in a much greater loss than simply losing the jacket. 
In this case, you are likely to keep your jacket with you at all times as a countermeasure 
to prevent its loss.
The countermeasures that individuals and organizations use to protect against threats 
vary. The best way to safeguard against a threat is to prevent it from occurring in the first 
place, but not every threat is preventable. In some cases, individuals and organizations 
must implement different countermeasures to identify, contain, and control threats, or to 
plan for losses in service or theft by purchasing insurance or installing backup systems. 
To implement effective countermeasures, you must identify the risk, determine how to 
protect the affected asset, and calculate the cost of the resources needed to protect the 
asset. This process of risk management focuses on identifying threats and determining 
available and affordable countermeasures to protect assets from those threats.
Using Encryption to Protect Against Secrecy 
Threats
Secrecy threats are the best known of the logical security categories; maintaining the 
secrecy of communication has been a challenge throughout history. To verify the con-
tents of a private message, the recipient needs proof that the message was not altered or 
intercepted during transit and was sent by the sender who signed it. The sender needs

proof that the message was sent without being altered or intercepted and was delivered 
to the intended recipient. These standards apply to all forms of messages, including those 
exchanged on paper, in electronic communication such as email messages, or with a 
Web server.
The study of ways to secure information is called cryptography. Encryption is the most 
common cryptographic process and the most widely used form of protection for data 
transmitted on any network, including the Internet. Encryption is the process of coding 
information using an algorithm to produce a string of characters that is unreadable. An 
algorithm is a formula or set of steps that solves a particular problem; some algorithms 
also use a key, which is a fact that the encryption algorithm uses as part of its formula. 
For example, a simple algorithm that does not use a key would be “reverse the order of 
the letters” (“time” would become “emit”). An example of an algorithm that uses a key 
would be “if the key is x, reverse the order of the letters” (“time” would become “emit”) 
and “if the key is y, use the next letter in the alphabet” (“time” would become “ujnf”). 
Using a key to process encrypted text so it is readable is called decryption. To decrypt 
text, you use a key to unlock it. Without the key, the program alone cannot reveal the 
content of the encrypted message. Encrypted information is called cipher text, whereas 
unencrypted information is called plain text.
The two basic types of encryption used on networks are private-key encryption and 
public-key encryption. Private-key encryption (also called symmetric encryption) uses 
a private key, or common key, known by both the sender and receiver, or by the pro-
grams that the sender and receiver are using to exchange messages. Figure 6-1 illustrates 
how private-key encryption works. In this example, the sender writes an email message 
and uses a menu command in the email program to encrypt the message with a private 
key, which might be a password. When the recipient receives the email message, his or 
her email program uses the same private key (password) to decrypt the message. During 
transit, the message is protected because it is encrypted. Private-key encryption works 
well in a highly controlled environment in which the sender and receiver both have the 
private key—the password in this case—or in which the sender’s and receiver’s email 
programs both have the same private key installed.
People who write programs 
or manipulate technologies 
to obtain unauthorized 
access to computers  
and networks are called 
crackers or hackers.

Internet | Tutorial 6 Internet Security
Public-key encryption, on the other hand, uses two different keys to encrypt mes-
sages. When using public-key encryption (also called asymmetric encryption), these 
different keys operate as a pair: A private key (also referred to as a secret key) is known 
only to one party, and a public key is known to everyone. Messages encrypted with a 
private key must be decrypted with the matching public key, and vice versa. 
Figure 6-2 illustrates how public-key encryption works. In this example, the sender 
encrypts the message with his or her private key, which is known only to the sender. The 
recipient uses the matching public key to decrypt the message. Because the recipient 
can only decrypt the message with the sender’s matching public key, the recipient can 
confirm the identity of the sender and read the message by decrypting it with the correct 
public key. Conversely, the recipient can send a reply to the sender and encrypt it with 
the same public key. When the sender receives it, only the matching private key will 
decrypt the message. However, in this case, the sender of a message encrypted with the 
public key could be anyone with the public key, so the sender’s identity cannot be veri-
fied by the public key.
Encryption is considered to be weak or strong based on its algorithm and the number 
of characters in the encryption key. The resistance of an encrypted message to attack 
attempts—also k nown as the key’s strength—depends on the size of the key used in the 
encryption procedure. A key size of 40 bits, called a 40-bit key, provides a minimal level 
of security because the average home computer can decipher (break) the key relatively 
quickly. Longer keys provide more security because it takes so long to decipher them; 
this is why 128-bit and 256-bit keys are commonly called strong keys. As computers 
become faster and more powerful, the length of keys must be increased to prevent those 
computers from being used to break encrypted transmissions.
Protecting the Integrity of Electronic Data
Data integrity threats represent the second major category of logical security. Unlike 
secrecy threats, in which someone simply sees or steals information, integrity threats can 
change the actions an individual or organization takes by altering the content of a mes-
sage or transaction. An integrity attack occurs when an unauthorized party alters data 
during its transfer over a network or while it is stored on a drive or server.

Public-key (asymmetric) encryption
the encrypted message travels accross the network en route to 
its destination, during which time its contents are indecipherable 
to someone who doesn’t have the matching public key
the encrypted message arrives at its 
destination; the recipient uses the matching 
public key to decrypt and read the message
the sender writes the message and uses 
the private key from a matching pair of 
keys (private and public) to encrypt it 
before sending it to the recipient
A 128-bit key is a number 
that is 3.4 3 1038 or 3.4 
followed by 38 zeroes. It 
could take billions of years 
for a computer to break a 
128-bit key.

For example, suppose a lawyer uses the Day-to-Day Web site to request a transcript of 
a legal meeting on a certain date, but an attacker prevents the Day-to-Day Web site from 
receiving the request and therefore prevents the company from being able to transcribe 
the meeting. The attacker in this case compromises the integrity of Day-to-Day’s reserva-
tion data. Alternatively, an attacker could use multiple fictitious names to reserve space 
with Day-to-Day in an attempt to prevent it from scheduling transcription services on 
certain dates and times with real clients. In the first case, Day-to-Day cannot fill an order 
that it never received; in the second case, Day-to-Day loses income that it would have 
earned if it had received orders for services from legitimate clients. In both cases, the 
attacker successfully diminishes the reputation and income of Day-to-Day.
Another type of integrity violation occurs when an email message is intercepted and 
its contents are changed before it is forwarded to its intended destination. In this type of 
integrity violation, which is called a man-in-the-middle exploit, a third party alters the 
contents of a message in a way that changes the message’s original meaning. For Day-
to-Day, an attacker could intercept an email message that contains a transcript of a legal 
meeting and change its content in a way that adversely affects a client.
Phishing Attacks
Another type of integrity threat occurs when you receive an email message that appears 
to be from someone you know or an established organization that you do business with, 
such as a bank; but instead, the message is from someone misrepresenting his or her 
identity in a type of scam known as spoofing. The spoofed identity of the sender makes 
it more likely that you will open the message because the message appears to be from 
someone you know.
Most individuals have received spoofed email messages from banks, online services, 
credit card companies, and other businesses indicating that their account data has 
been lost or must be verified to continue using the service. For many people, a clue to 
the authenticity of these messages is the fact that they do not have an account with the 
sender of the message.
However, many individuals do have an account with the message’s sender. These 
people read the messages, click a hyperlink to go to a Web site that appears to be the 
legitimate Web site of the message’s sender, and enter the required information into a 
form. The form illicitly collects the entered data, which usually includes the person’s 
name and address, account number, login information including a password, and often 
the person’s Social Security number or a credit card number.
Because the email message seems genuine and the spoofed site contains the com-
pany’s correct logos, many people participate in this type of attack without realizing it. 
Many well-known organizations, including eBay, Citibank, PayPal, and even the Internal 
Revenue Service, have been spoofed. Some companies become aware of the fraudulent 
email messages when customers contact them to verify the original message.
This type of attack, called phishing because it “fishes” for information, is difficult to 
prevent because it involves sending email messages that appear to be legitimate but 
include links to spoofed Web sites instead. Simply receiving the message usually doesn’t 
cause any harm; the recipient must follow the instructions in the message or click its 
included hyperlinks to actually become a victim of the attack.
The basic structure of a phishing attack is fairly simple. The attacker sends an email 
message (such as the one shown in Figure 6-3) to a large number of recipients with the 
goal of finding recipients who have accounts at the targeted Web site (PayPal is the tar-
geted site shown in the figure, but PayPal did not send this message).

The email message tells the recipient that his or her account has been compromised 
and asks the recipient to log in to the account and correct the problem. The email mes-
sage includes a link that appears to connect to the login page of the actual PayPal Web 
site. However, the link actually connects to a spoofed Web site, which is designed to 
look like the PayPal Web site. Figure 6-4 shows how to identify spoofed hyperlinks used 
in a phishing attack. After clicking a spoofed hyperlink, the victim opens a Web page at 
the spoofed Web site and uses the page to enter his or her login name and password, 
which the perpetrator captures and then uses to access the victim’s account at the real 
Web site. After using the victim’s real login information to access the victim’s account, 
the phisher can access personal information, make purchases, or withdraw funds.
Many email programs alert users when a link in an email message opens a Web 
page that is coded to a different URL than the one displayed in the message. Phishing 
attackers use different methods to hide their Web sites’ true URLs, including code that 
creates pop-up windows that look exactly like a browser’s address bar. The window is 
programmed to open very quickly and position itself to precisely cover the browser’s 
address bar. You can learn more about the details of phishing attacks by visiting the Web 
site for the APWG (Anti-Phishing Working Group), a not-for-profit association focused on 
eliminating the fraud, crime, and identity theft that result from various types of attacks.

In addition to protecting the integrity of data, Fiona also needs to understand the 
methods she can use to protect copyrighted data. One method that she can use to pro-
tect copyrighted data is to use a digital watermark.
Protecting Copyrighted Materials Using Digital 
Watermarks
Protecting copyrighted works from threats is a logical security issue, although the 
methods used differ from those that protect other types of data. Threats to copyrighted 
materials result from the relative ease with which existing material can be used without 
the owner’s permission. Actual monetary damage resulting from a copyright infringement 
is more difficult to measure than damage from secrecy, integrity, or necessity violations, 
but the harm can be just as great. When material is duplicated or used without consent, 
the copyright’s owner loses the earnings (for example, royalties or related consulting fees) 
from the material and no longer controls its use by others.
The technology of the Internet facilitates copyright infringement in two ways. First, it is 
very easy to reproduce an exact copy of anything you find on the Internet, regardless of 
its copyright restrictions. Second, many people are simply naïve or unaware of copyright 
restrictions that protect electronic works. Examples of both unwitting and willful Internet 
copyright violations occur every day.
Although copyright laws were enacted before the creation of the Internet, the Internet 
itself has complicated the enforcement of copyrights by publishers. Recognizing the 
unauthorized reprinting of written text is relatively easy; tracing the path of a photograph 
that has been used on a Web page without authorization is far more difficult.
Some companies that distribute copyrighted art, photographs, and other materials use 
digital watermarking to help protect their ownership interests in those materials. A digital 
watermark is a digital pattern containing copyright information that is inserted into a dig-
ital image, animation, or audio or video file. The watermark is inserted into the file using 
a software program so that it is invisible and undetectable. To view the digital watermark, 
a software program unlocks the watermark, retrieving the information it stores. 
For example, a photographer might protect a photograph by adding an undetect-
able digital watermark that includes the photographer’s name and contact information, 
in addition to a copyright notice that is clearly visible on the photograph itself. If the

image as his or her own by unlocking the digital watermark stored on the unauthorized 
copy of the image, even when the visible copyright has been electronically removed.

INSIGHT
Hiding Messages Using Steganography
Steganography can also protect digital works. Steganography is a process that hides 
messages within different types of files. Steganography is based on the fact that digital 
sound, video, image, and animation files contain portions of unused data that can be 
used to hide messages. Steganography is generally used as a way to covertly conceal 
messages within different forms of communication, but it can also be used to add copy-
right information to different types of files.
In addition to protecting personal or business data, you must be alert for other types of 
security threats that prevent people from accessing a computer or server. These types of 
attacks, called denial-of-service attacks, are described next.
Preventing Denial-of-Service Attacks
A necessity threat disrupts normal computer processing or denies processing entirely. 
Programs used in necessity attacks work by reducing a computer’s processing speed 
to intolerably low levels or by completely disabling the computer. The most common 
necessity attack, called a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, occurs when an attacker floods 
a computer, server, or network with messages with the goal of consuming the network’s 
bandwidth resources and disabling its services and communications. Even if the attack 
fails to disable the server, computer, or network, the resulting processing delays can ren-
der a service unusable or unattractive.
Because a DoS attacker does not need to access an organization’s server to attack it, 
Web sites are particularly vulnerable to DoS attacks. The Web sites for Microsoft, eBay, 
Amazon.com, and many other companies have been victims of DoS attacks that resulted 
in service interruptions to their customers.
As you learned earlier in this book, a Web browser loads a Web page by sending a 
message to a Web server that requests the page. The Web server responds with a mes-
sage that contains the HTML content of the Web page, along with any image or other 
files required to display the Web page in the browser. When a Web browser is used in 
a DoS attack, it sends thousands of page requests per minute to the Web server with 
the goal of overloading the server. In some cases, each of the page request messages 
has a false return address, so the Web server consumes processing resources in an 
attempt to solve the problem. As more page requests arrive at the Web browser, and as 
the efforts to solve the problem and to process the new requests accumulate, the server 
becomes overloaded and unavailable to process legitimate requests. Ultimately, the 
server shuts down.
In a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the attacker takes control of one or 
more computers without the owner’s permission and uses those computers to launch a 
DoS attack on other computers, servers, or networks. Most DDoS attacks are launched 
after the attacking computers are infected with Trojan horse programs. Each Trojan horse 
program is coded to open and launch a DoS attack at exactly the same date and time. 
DoS attacks can also 
threaten other types of 
networks, including cel-
lular, mobile, and wireless 
networks.

Other computers are hijacked by this type of Trojan horse and, without the knowledge 
of their owners, are used to help the DDoS attack; such computers are often called bots 
(short for “robots”) or zombies. Figure 6-7 describes how a client can launch a DoS 
attack or a DDoS attack on a server.
INSIGHT
Recognizing the Symptoms of a DoS or DDoS Attack
Although most DoS attacks are launched to reduce the processing power of or to dis-
able a Web server, it is possible for an individual’s personal computer to become a vic-
tim of a DoS attack. Some of the first warning signs that a server or computer has been 
compromised in a DoS attack include the following:
• When a computer is affected, it might take much longer than normal to respond to user 
requests. Simple actions such as opening a file, downloading email messages, or dis-
playing a particular Web page might happen slowly or the user might receive an error 
that the request has timed out, which means that the request could not be completed.
• When a server is affected, users will encounter very slow network performance when 
attempting to download files, access email, or open Web pages. A Web site might 
not respond at all to user requests or it might display error pages.
• In most cases, the user or server will receive an exceptionally large number of email 
messages (all spam) at once as the intruder floods the server with requests during 
the attack.
It is important to note that each of these warning signs can also be the result of other 
computer and network problems. For example, a computer or server that is slow to 
respond to user requests might have a virus or be encountering other types of network 
problems that are unrelated to a DoS threat.
If you believe that your computer is involved in a DoS attack, you should contact your 
network administrator or ISP immediately to alert them to any unusual activity, and then 
turn your computer off.
Figure 6-7	
Normal processing, a DoS attack, and a DDoS attack
Normal processing between client and server:
1. The client sends a request to the server for the home page.
2. The server reviews the request.
3. The server sends the ﬁle named Default.html to the client.
DoS attack that ﬂoods the server with messages in an attempt to 
slow or disable the server:
1. The client bombards the server with messages all sent at the same 
time. The messages contain false return information.
2. The server cannot process the messages.
3. The server cannot contact the client to clarify the request because the 
client’s message contains false return information. Server processing 
grinds to a halt during the attack to the point where legitimate client 
requests cannot be processed.
DDoS attack hijacks clients, which are then used to send messages 
to the server in an attempt to slow or disable the server:
1. The master client sends a Trojan horse to each client.
2. Each client launches a DoS attack on the server by ﬂooding it
with messages.
3. The server cannot process the messages.
4. The server’s processing speed slows or stops while attempting to 
process the messages.

Tutorial 6 Internet Security | Internet
To prevent an attack on your computer or a server that you manage, you must be alert 
for the warning signs. You can also install different types of hardware and software on 
your devices and network that will monitor them to detect problems early and prevent 
attacks. You can use the DoS Attacks section in the Additional Information section of the 
Weblinks page for Tutorial 6 to explore the different solutions for detecting DoS attacks.
A company can defend its Web server from DoS and DDoS attacks by installing a 
denial-of-service filter, or DoS filter, to monitor communication between the Web 
server and the router that connects it to the Internet. A DoS filter, which can be a sepa-
rate computer or software running on the Web server, identifies potential attacks by 
watching for patterns of incoming page requests or for specific repeating elements in the 
page request messages. The filter can be configured to block messages automatically if 
they contain similar elements and arrive in rapid sequence. In many cases, DoS attackers 
try to configure their messages so these filters cannot identify them, but the filter vendors 
respond by frequently updating their identification criteria. DoS filter functions are often 
included as part of a network software tool called a packet sniffer, which examines the 
structure of the data elements that flow through a network. Figure 6-8 shows how a DoS 
filter works to prevent an attack on the server.
Because Fiona will be working with contractors who must provide their confidential 
personal information, such as their Social Security numbers, to receive payment for their 
work, she wants to make sure that people who work for her company are protected from 
becoming victims of identity theft.
Recognizing and Preventing Identity Theft
The amount of personal information that Web sites collect about the page viewing hab-
its, product selections, and demographic information of their visitors can pose a threat 
to those visitors when this information is collected with the goal of stealing from them. 
Consumers have become accustomed to providing their credit card and contact informa-
tion to online vendors, but an increasing amount of personal information is stored on 
networked computers at banks, credit card issuers, credit reporting agencies, physician’s 
offices, hospitals, and government agencies. As more personal information is stored on 
these computers, there are more opportunities for theft of that information.
Protecting the server from a DoS or DDoS attack:
1. The client sends a legitimate message to the server.
2. The DoS ﬁlter receives the request, analyzes it, and sends it to the server.
3. The server receives the message.
4. The client sends a message to the server that contains or is part of an attack.
5. The DoS ﬁlter analyzes the message and determines that it might contain an attack.
6. The DoS ﬁlter prevents the message from reaching the server.

Figure 6-9 identifies some common personal information that can be stolen and used, 
along with some problems that might result from the theft. When multiple items shown 
in Figure 6-9 are stolen, a thief can potentially steal a person’s entire identity. In this 
type of crime, called an identity theft, a thief can use the victim’s personal information 
to open bank accounts, obtain new credit cards, and purchase items using credit cards, 
often damaging the victim’s credit rating in addition to making transactions for which the 
victim is responsible. When the victim discovers the identity theft, the thief has already 
stolen cash and goods. It can take a long time for identity theft victims to clear their 
credit records of the unpaid charges made by the thief and restore their credit.

Protecting Yourself Against Identity Theft
To protect against identity theft, individuals can implement certain habits to reduce the 
chances of becoming a victim and to make it easier to recover from an identity theft 
incident. Some important habits include:
• Keeping credit card, bank account, and investment account information (account 
numbers, passwords, contact telephone numbers, and so on) together in a safe place 
that is easy to access should an identity theft incident occur.
• Saving credit card and debit card receipts, matching them to monthly statements, and 
reporting any unauthorized charges to the card issuer immediately. After verifying the 
charges on the monthly statements, the receipts should be shredded.
• Monitoring expiration dates on credit and debit cards and contacting the issuer if 
replacement cards do not arrive before the old cards expire.
• Shredding all mail that contains any personal information (such as unsolicited credit 
card offers) before throwing it into the trash.
• Arranging to have your mail held at the post office or collected by a trusted friend to 
protect it from theft when you are away from home.
• Only providing your Social Security number to a third party when it is legally required 
to do so, and never having it printed on your checks.
• Putting a fraud alert on your credit report at all three of the major credit reporting 
companies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) after suspecting a problem, after a 
theft, or as a preventive measure. This requires the reporting company to contact you 
before releasing your credit report to anyone and can help prevent someone else 
from opening credit accounts in your name.
• Obtaining a free copy of your credit report on a regular basis to monitor your credit 
history for any problems.
• Purchasing identity theft insurance, which can help pay the expenses required to clear 
and restore your identity in case of a theft. Some financial institutions offer this insur-
ance for an affordable monthly fee, and some insurance companies offer it as part of 
a renter’s or homeowner’s insurance policy. In addition, there are companies that will 
monitor your credit report and assist with expenses related to identity theft restora-
tion for a monthly or annual fee.
If you believe you are a victim of identity theft, you must act quickly to contact the 
three credit reporting agencies, every financial institution at which you have an account, 
and the issuer of every credit card you hold. You can learn more about contacting credit 
reporting agencies and getting a free annual copy of your credit report by visiting the 
links in the Contacting Credit Reporting Agencies section of the Weblinks page for 
Tutorial 6.

Problem-Solving: Recovering from an Identity Theft
Victims of identity theft are often unaware that their accounts or identities have been 
stolen or compromised, and they usually learn of the theft long after it actually occurred. 
Some people are careless with their personal property and identifying documents and 
simply do not realize that their important documents have been lost or stolen. 
Regardless of when you discover an identity theft, you should act quickly to prevent 
further loss. An important organizational tool is to know what you have lost and how to 
contact the institutions involved. Regardless of what prompted the loss, you should com-
plete the following basic steps as soon as possible:
• Contact financial institutions, credit card companies, and any agencies that issued your 
identification cards or driver’s license and report the loss. Close any affected financial or 
credit accounts immediately. If you have lost any blank checks, place stop payments on 
the affected checks.
• Contact all three credit reporting agencies (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax) and place 
a fraud alert on your credit report. This will prevent a thief from using your identification 
to open additional accounts, and it will also alert you to any accounts that have already 
been illegally opened in your name.
• Contact your local post office to make sure that your mail hasn’t been forwarded to 
another address without your consent. Some thieves immediately change your address 
to postpone your knowledge of the theft so credit card and other statements are not 
mailed to you.
• File a police report with local law enforcement to document the theft, and keep a copy 
of the report.
If you suspect that your entire identity has been stolen, you will also need to contact 
all of your creditors to report the identity theft. You should change your user name and 
password on all of your accounts as you report the thefts. As a precaution, do not use the 
same user name and password at more than one site, and do not reuse any previous user 
name and password. This will protect your accounts from further loss in case the thief gains 
access to your user name and password as part of the identity theft.
The Recovering from an Identity Theft section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 6 includes 
resources that you can review to learn more about recovering from an identity theft.
Many of Fiona’s clients and contractors use social networks for both personal and 
professional communications. Therefore, she wants to understand the security issues that 
users face when using these networks, and the countermeasures used to minimize the 
risk of problems.
Security Concerns for Social Network Users
More than a billion people and businesses around the world use social networks to 
communicate with friends, family, colleagues, and customers. Most businesses use 
their individual Web sites to promote and sell their goods and services. Many of these 
same businesses have created accounts on social networks to provide another way to

communicate with and reach their customers. Each day, thousands of users and busi-
nesses expand their online presences by creating accounts on the dozens of popular 
social networks on the Internet. As use of these social networks increases, individuals 
and businesses must implement appropriate security strategies to protect themselves 
from different types of problems and threats.
Because Fiona plans to create an account on Facebook, the world’s largest social 
network, and also on LinkedIn, the world’s largest social network for business profession-
als, she wants to review some precautions that will ensure the safety and privacy of her 
information and her clients’ information.
To learn more about social network security issues:

2.	 Read the information, which is provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security, about protecting data on a social networking site. Notice that many of 
the protections listed involve limiting the kind and amount of information a user 
posts on his or her own page.
◗	
3.	 Return to the Weblinks page for Tutorial 6, and then click the Facebook Security 
page link. Facebook, which has more than 800 million users, regularly updates its 
security information with information about current threats and countermeasures.
◗	
4.	 Use the links on the left side of the Facebook Security page to read about current 
threats, taking action, and security tips. As you review the information on each 
page, be alert for information directed at individuals and businesses. You should 
notice that there are specific settings to protect the data posted on a social 
network. In addition, you should find information about what kind of information 
you should not post and the reasons why sharing certain information might pose 
a security risk.
◗	
5.	 When you are finished exploring the Facebook Security page, close your browser.
In addition to carefully controlling the information you post on a social network-
ing site and choosing the security settings that offer the most protection, you must also 
rely on common sense to protect your identity, property, and privacy. Many hoaxes and 
scams start on social networking sites, such as fake disaster relief funds and assistance 
programs for people in need. Because you might be viewing these types of pleas for help 
on your friends’ pages, you might be more inclined to trust their genuineness and con-
tribute to them, without realizing that they are not legitimate charities.
With the popularity of sites that allow users to send very short updates of approxi-
mately 160 characters or less to their friends, the need to abbreviate links to Web sites 
has become a necessity. Many Web sites provide a service that lets a user shorten a long 
URL to include significantly fewer characters. For example, Figure 6-12 shows a long 
URL for a page at the Cengage Learning Web site and its shortened equivalent, as pro-
vided by the TinyURL.com Web site. Clicking the shortened link will open the same Web 
page at the Cengage Learning Web site without requiring the user to type the full URL.
Users with Facebook 
accounts can “like” the 
Facebook Security page to 
make it easy to view secu-
rity updates when viewing 
their own pages.

As you can see, the shortened URL contains significantly fewer characters than the 
full URL on the Cengage Learning Web site. The shortened URL is easier to include in 
messages that limit the number of characters per message, or in publications in which a 
longer URL might be broken across two or more lines. When you can see the full URL 
in an email message or on someone’s social networking site, you can determine that the 
page is stored on a server with the domain name cengage.com. In addition, the remain-
ing content in the full URL appears to include details that identify a book, such as the 
author’s name and the book’s ISBN. If you know that you are receiving a link to the 
product page for a book, the additional information in the full URL provides evidence 
that the URL is legitimate.
However, when you see only the shortened URL, you cannot extrapolate the same 
information found in the full URL. The only information you have is that the URL has 
been shortened. In this case, clicking the shortened URL in Figure 6-12 opens the book’s 
product page. But in actuality, clicking the shortened URL could open any page or file 
and lead to a spoofed site, a file that opens and executes a virus, or other problems that 
could pose a security threat to the user’s computer and privacy. Although most shortened 
URLs are legitimate, it is important to be alert for the potential security problems that 
they can cause.
Now that Fiona has a better understanding of the main types of online security threats 
and how they are executed, she can begin her exploration of specific countermeasures. 
You will learn about specific Web client, communication channel, and Web server 
threats and countermeasures in Session 6.2.

Web Client Security
The Day-to-Day computers and Web server are vulnerable to the types of threats that 
you learned about in Session 6.1. Fortunately, there are countermeasures that Fiona can 
implement to protect her computer assets and the data stored on them from harm. In this 
session, you will learn about security threats and countermeasures for Web clients, the 
communication channel that connects Web clients to Web servers, and the Web servers 
themselves. One of the most important Web client security risks arises from the existence 
of active content.
Active Content: Java, JavaScript, and ActiveX
One of the most dangerous entry points for DoS attacks is from programs that travel with 
applications to a browser and are executed on the user’s computer. These programs, 
often called active content, include Java, JavaScript, and ActiveX components that can 
run programs on a Web client. Active content components can make Web pages more 
useful by providing interactive content, such as calculating shipping costs, creating mort-
gage payment tables, or creating animation. Unfortunately, these components can also 
be used for malicious purposes.
For example, a Java applet, which is a program written in the Java programming 
language, could execute and consume a computer’s resources. Similarly, a JavaScript 
program can pose a threat because it can run without being compiled (that is, translated 
into computer-readable codes). A cleverly written JavaScript program could examine 
your computer’s programs and email a file from your computer back to a Web server.
ActiveX controls are Microsoft’s technology for writing small applications that perform 
specific actions in Web pages; these controls have access to a computer’s file system. For 
example, a hidden ActiveX control in a Web page could scan a hard drive for specific 
types of files and print them on any network printer. Similarly, an ActiveX control could 
reformat a hard drive.
Because ActiveX controls are executed on the client computer, Internet Explorer 
secures them with a digital signature that confirms each developer’s identity. A digital 
signature provides verification of the contents of a file and identifies its author or devel-
oper. When a digital signature authenticates an ActiveX control’s developer or source, it 
is called a signed ActiveX control. Internet Explorer maintains a list of known developers 
and examines the digital signature of any ActiveX control before downloading it to the 
client computer to determine its authenticity. This method protects Internet Explorer users 
from downloading rogue controls.
ActiveX controls only work in Internet Explorer and other browsers that use the 
Internet Explorer code base in some way. Thus, Firefox, which does not use any part of 
the Internet Explorer code base, cannot run a beneficial ActiveX control, nor can it be 
attacked by a malicious ActiveX control.
Although most Java, JavaScript, and ActiveX controls are beneficial, you can protect 
your computer from potential attacks that use them by preventing your Web browser 
from automatically running Java and JavaScript programs.

signature from a certificate 
authority, which you’ll learn 
about later in this session.

3.	 Click the Security tab to display the browser’s security settings. Internet Explorer 
uses four zones to let the user customize the browser’s security settings. The four 
zones are for the Internet, the local intranet, trusted sites, and restricted sites. 
The Internet zone controls the security settings when viewing Web sites that you 
haven’t previously designated as trusted or restricted sites. The Internet zone’s 
default setting of Medium-high will cause the browser to prompt you before it 
downloads potentially unsafe content and prevents the browser from download-
ing unsigned ActiveX controls. The Local intranet zone has a default security level 
of Medium-low and controls the security settings for Web sites that are on an 
intranet to which you are connected. The Trusted sites zone has a default security 
level of Medium and controls the security settings for Web sites that you have 
previously designated as being safe. The Restricted sites zone has a default secu-
rity level of High and controls the security settings for Web sites that you have 
previously designated as being potentially unsafe.

Fiona appreciates the information about active content security threats and how to 
customize the settings in Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome. The next countermea-
sure for Web clients is one that detects and removes malicious programs that might be 
sent with other files to the user’s computer.
Detecting and Removing Malware
Malware, a term that means “malicious software,” is a category of software that is 
installed without the user’s consent, usually through a hidden program in an email 
attachment or from a file downloaded from a Web site. Perhaps the biggest threat of 
malware is that it is designed to be invisible to the user, who might have malicious code 
running on a device for a long time before suspecting a problem. Viruses, Trojan horses, 
and worms that attack computers are all examples of malware, and the programs they 
run are forms of integrity threats. 
A virus is a program that replicates itself with the goal of infecting other computers. 
For a virus to spread from one computer to another, it must be executed so it can infect 
other files and programs. A Trojan horse is a program hidden inside another program. 
Trojan horse programs claim to be legitimate programs that accomplish some task when, 
in fact, they cause harm when the user accesses or downloads the program in which 
they are hidden. Trojan horse programs range from prank programs that display a mes-
sage and then disappear, to destructive programs that can delete or steal files. Unlike a 
virus, a Trojan horse does not replicate itself, nor does it affect other files or programs.
Because most Trojan horse programs are hidden, it is possible to infect a computer 
by executing a file downloaded from a site that offers free software or by opening a file 
attached to an email message. When you execute the program or open the email attach-
ment, the file secretly launches a separate Trojan horse program, which quietly does its 
damage. Unfortunately, antivirus software programs and firewalls cannot guarantee that 
your computer is protected from this type of attack. To protect against this type of threat, 
you should be careful not to execute a file that you did not request, and you should 
download files and programs from trusted sources only. Because of the stealth nature of 
Trojan horse attacks, some people and companies enforce a general policy of not open-
ing any email attachments sent over the Internet.
Another threat is a worm, which is a self-replicating and self-executing program that 
sends copies of itself to other computers over a network. Unlike viruses, a worm can rep-
licate itself on a computer or server, but it cannot attach itself to other files. Many worms 
arrive as email attachments. When the user opens the attachment, the worm infects the 
user’s computer, and then quickly attempts to send itself to email addresses stored in the 
address book of the user’s email program.

Internet | Tutorial 6 Internet Security
Adware, which is short for “ad-supported software,” is a general category of software 
that includes advertisements to help pay for the program in which they appear. Adware, 
when installed with the user’s consent and knowledge, provides a revenue source for 
software programs that are offered to users for free. In exchange for their use of the free 
program, users might see pop-up or other types of advertisements on their computer. 
This category of adware is not harmful because it does not cause any security threats to 
the user, who is informed of the ads when installing the program. In addition, the parties 
responsible for including ads are clearly identified in the programs.
If you use a legitimate adware program, the program’s developer tells you that your 
use of the free software is supported by ads that you will see when you use it, and the 
developer provides information about how to disable the ads (usually by paying a fee to 
use a version of the software that does not display ads). 
When adware is installed on a computer without the user’s knowledge and consent, 
either by itself or in conjunction with a program that the user did intend to install, it 
becomes a form of malware called spyware. Spyware works much like adware except 
that the user has no control over or knowledge of the ads and other monitoring fea-
tures the ads contain. The spyware vendor does not inform the user that the software 
will include ads. Software that gathers personal information about the user’s behaviors 
(such as which sites the user visits or what search expressions the user enters on a search 
engine site) or the user’s computer (such as what type of software or hardware is installed 
on the computer) without the knowledge of the user is also a form of spyware.
Internet security software can prevent the spread of viruses, worms, Trojan horses, 
and other forms of malware by blocking them from being downloaded from the server. 
Many companies offer different versions of Internet security software that are customized 
for the needs of individuals, small businesses, and large organizations. An individual 
or small business might be interested in installing Internet security software on several 
computers using a single license. A large organization might be interested in software 
features that let its information technology department update all of the company’s com-
puters automatically.
All Internet security software vendors sell their products through Web sites, so you can 
learn more about the vendors and their products quite easily. Two vendors that provide a 
full range of products are Norton (from the company named Symantec) and McAfee.

In your research of different security programs, you probably noticed some similari-
ties in their features and benefits. You can use these programs to scan downloaded files, 
including email attachments, for viruses and other threats. If the program detects a threat, 
you can set it to alert you to the problem or remove it automatically. Most programs also 
include options to download updates automatically or on a schedule you set to install 
program updates as new threats are discovered. In addition, most programs include 
options to regularly scan your computer to detect and eliminate new threats. 
Most Internet security programs include features that detect all forms of malware and 
prevent it from being downloaded to your computer either by itself or in conjunction with a 
legitimate program. However, because malware is often hidden in other programs, running 
an Internet security program might not adequately protect your computer. In this case, you 
can purchase a separate software program that scans your entire hard drive for malware and 
includes tools to remove it. If you download many files to your computer, you might want to 
invest in a separate malware program. Figure 6-20 shows a screen from Lavasoft Ad-Aware 
Free, a popular program for scanning for adware. This program scans all of the files on the 
user’s computer and detects adware. The limited version, which is free, will eliminate mal-
ware threats. Users who want a higher level of protection, such as scanning all downloaded 
files to the user’s computer in real time, can purchase the full version of the software.

Problem Solving: Recognizing the Symptoms of a Malware Infection
Even the most diligent computer users occasionally encounter problems on their machines, 
some of which are the result of a malware infection. Although the following symptoms are 
not always the result of a malware infection, encountering any one or more of the follow-
ing problems might indicate a problem. Computer users should be on the lookout for the 
following symptoms of malware infections:
• Your computer shows an increase in network activity, even though you aren’t using the 
network for your current tasks, indicating the possibility that a hidden program is using 
your network connection to send data from your computer to a third party.
• If you are using a laptop, you might notice that your battery doesn’t last as long as usual, 
indicating additional processing activity that could be related to a malware infection.
• Your browser’s home page suddenly changes to a site that you didn’t specify and without 
your consent, which can result from a Trojan horse or a virus.
• Your antivirus or Internet security program stops working, or is offline, but you didn’t 
make this change. In some cases, you are unable to reactivate these programs, even 
after restarting your computer. These types of problems are usually the result of a virus.
• You receive alerts from your computer’s firewall, antivirus program, or Internet security 
program indicating the presence of a virus or other problem. These messages might 
appear to come from your actual firewall, antivirus program, or Internet security pro-
gram, but the potential exists for them to actually be the result of a malware infection 
that is designed to look like an actual program alert.
• Pop-up windows appear as you are working, even when you are not using your browser. 
These windows might contain advertisements or offensive content and are usually a 
symptom of a virus. 
• Clicking a hyperlink in a search engine’s results page takes you to a site that you aren’t 
expecting, indicating that the hyperlink has been hijacked by spyware.
• Programs or files are missing from your computer, or you have new programs on the 
Start menu that you didn’t install, potentially indicating a virus.
• Your Windows settings change without your consent. These changes might include the 
disappearance of the Start button or the mouse pointer, or the appearance of toolbars 
for programs that you didn’t install. The computer might randomly shut down and restart 
itself. These problems might indicate a Trojan horse.
If you encounter any of these problems, proceed quickly and cautiously to prevent any 
further security breaches, and immediately run a program that can detect and eliminate 
any potential malware infections. If you can run the detection program from a drive that 
you know isn’t infected, such as a flash drive, you might get better results. If you have two 
or more of these problems occurring on a regular basis, and despite your efforts you can-
not identify any infection, you might want to bring your computer to a specialist who has 
experience in detecting and removing malware infections.
You can learn more about malware and the tools that detect and remove it using the 
links in the Malware Detection section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 6.

Blocking Tracking Devices in Electronic 
Communications
In Tutorial 1, you learned that some Web sites use cookies to store data on users’ com-
puters to provide information about their site visits, such as which pages they viewed. 
Most sites that use cookies to enhance the user’s experience at a Web site provide infor-
mation in their privacy policy to let users know that the site uses cookies and what type 
of data it stores in the cookies it writes to their computers. Although cookies themselves 
are not harmful, they can pose a security threat. Web sites can collect a great deal of 
information about customers’ preferences, even before they place an order. The most 
well-known security threat of this type is a Web bug.
A Web bug is a small, hidden graphic on a Web page or in an email message that is 
designed to work in conjunction with a cookie to obtain information about the person 
viewing the page or email message and to send that information to a third party. The 
hidden graphic is usually a GIF file with a size of one pixel, which is approximately the 
same size as the period at the end of this sentence. Because a Web bug is usually cre-
ated with a GIF file, it is sometimes called a clear GIF or a transparent GIF; it is designed 
to be hidden on the Web page in which it appears. Figure 6-21 shows a section of an 
HTML document that creates a Web bug in a Web page.
Notice that the location of the clear GIF shown in Figure 6-21 is a URL for 
DoubleClick, a division of Google that develops tools for Internet marketing and adver-
tising. When the user loads the Web page that contains this code, the browser down-
loads the clear GIF file from the DoubleClick server. DoubleClick has a network of 
thousands of members that provide information to it. The process of downloading the 
clear GIF file can identify your IP address, the Web site you last visited, and other infor-
mation about your use of the site in which the clear GIF has been embedded and record 
it in the cookie file. Figure 6-22 shows part of the Web page that contains the Web bug. 
Notice that the GIF file is not visible because it is transparent and therefore hidden. You 
would need to examine the HTML document (shown in Figure 6-21) that is the source 
file of this Web page to find the Web bug.

When you first access a DoubleClick member’s Web site, DoubleClick uses a cookie, 
sometimes called an ad-serving cookie or marketing cookie, to assign you a number 
and record it. Then, when you visit any DoubleClick member’s Web site in the future, 
DoubleClick reads the cookie it wrote on your hard drive and gets your identification 
number. As you use your browser to visit different Web sites, DoubleClick can use its 
cookie to collect information about the sites you visit and sell this information to its mem-
bers so they can customize their Web sites with advertising tailored to your interests. 
For example, if you have been shopping online for a new computer and you notice 
that suddenly you are seeing a large number of ads for computers on different Web sites, 
a cookie is likely responsible for the apparent coincidence. A cookie might also cause 
you to receive email messages that contain ads for computers. Some people see this 
technology as an invasion of privacy because they might not want computer vendors 
knowing that they are looking for a new computer, and they might object to receiving 
email messages from them.
A Web bug is an example of spyware because the clear GIF and its actions are hidden 
from the user. Spyware is not illegal (unless it is used as part of a criminal activity, such 
as gathering information to be used in identity theft), but it does create privacy concerns 
for many Web users. Many people believe that marketing use of spyware is unethical. 
The programs you install, especially free and limited-use trial versions of programs, 
might include spyware to track your use of the programs and of the Internet, or they 
might collect data about you and distribute that data to a third party.
You can prevent Web sites from writing cookies to your computer by changing your 
browser’s settings to prevent cookies from being stored on your computer. However, 
when you disable cookies, you also will lose some of the positive attributes that cook-
ies can provide. By setting your Internet security program or other program, such as 
Ad-Aware, to remove cookies on a regular basis, you can eliminate cookies that store 
user data from your computer.
Blocking Communication Using a Firewall
Like its counterpart in the physical world, which acts as a barrier to keep a fire from 
spreading from one area of a building to another, the computer version of a firewall 
is a software program or hardware device that controls access between two networks, 
such as a local area network and the Internet, or between the Internet and a computer. 
Firewalls can be used on both Web servers and Web clients. A Web client firewall might 
be a dedicated hardware device or a program running on a computer.
When a computer is connected to the Internet, it receives traffic from other computers 
without its user even realizing it. Most of this traffic is harmless; but without protection, 
an authorized party can gain access to a computer through a port. A port on a computer 
is like a door: It permits traffic to leave and enter a computer. When the port is closed, 
traffic can’t leave or enter the computer. The port might be a hardware interface, such as 
a port to which you connect a printer, or it might be a virtual port that handles different 
kinds of information.
Virtual ports use numbers to isolate traffic by type; a computer has more than 
65,000 virtual ports for different processes such as HTTP/World Wide Web traffic  
(port 80), FTP traffic (port 21), SMTP email (port 25), POP3 email (port 110), and SSL 
(port 443). To connect to the Internet, you must open port 80. If port 80 is not properly 
protected, an authorized party can use port 80 or other virtual ports to access your 
computer.

Tutorial 6 Internet Security | Internet
A firewall can control incoming traffic by rejecting it unless you have configured it 
to accept the traffic. For example, some Web sites include features that let you test the 
security of your computer by asking the site to run a port scan on your computer. During 
a port scan, one computer tests all or some of the ports of another computer to determine 
whether its ports are open (traffic is not filtered and the port permits entry through it), 
closed (the port does not accept traffic, but a cracker could use this port to gain entry to 
and analyze your computer), or stealth (the port might be open or closed, but permits no 
entry through it). You can run a port scan by visiting a Web site that offers this service. The 
Port Scan Sites section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 6 includes links to such sites.
Most firewalls are installed to prevent traffic from entering the network, but firewalls 
can also prevent data from leaving the network. This feature is especially useful for con-
trolling the activities of hidden programs that are designed to compromise the security of 
a computer. When you install a new program on your computer, a firewall that provides 
this type of outgoing protection will notify you if the new program tries to access the 
Internet. You can then adjust the firewall settings to allow the program to access the 
Internet always, only when you approve such access, or never.
Until the recent increase in the number of users with broadband connections to the 
Internet, hardware firewalls were used almost exclusively by large organizations because 
of the number of computers connected to the network and the expense of acquiring, 
installing, and maintaining the firewall. However, with some firewall software programs 
available free or at a very low cost, they have become popular with other types of users, 
including those with home networks or people accessing the Internet using a single 
computer. One popular personal firewall software program is ZoneAlarm, which offers 
a free version. Antivirus programs and Internet security suites available from Norton and 
McAfee also include basic firewalls. Recent versions of the Windows operating system 
include a basic firewall. You can learn more about using the Windows firewall, along 
with other firewall resources, by clicking the links listed under the Firewalls heading on 
the Weblinks page for Tutorial 6.
Because the primary function of a firewall is to block unwanted traffic from reach-
ing the network it protects, each organization that installs a firewall needs to determine 
what kind of traffic to block and what kind of traffic to permit. For example, Fiona might 
configure the Day-to-Day firewall to prevent unauthorized access to the network by 
individuals and computers outside the network, to prevent programs on the client from 
accessing the network to initiate data transfers, or both.
Now that you have learned about specific security issues for Web client computers, it 
is time to learn more about security on the communication channel; that is, for informa-
tion traveling on the Internet itself.
Communication Channel Security
In Session 6.1, you learned how encryption works. Encryption is an important part of 
securing data that is sent over any network, including the Internet. The first step in secur-
ing a communication channel is to verify the identity of the user and the server sending 
messages. 
Authentication is a general term for the process of verifying the identity of a person, 
computer, or server with a high degree of certainty. Most computer systems implement 
user identification and authentication with login information in the form of user names 
(identification) and passwords (authentication). As you learned in Tutorial 2, many Web 
sites require you to establish a user name and password before you can use the site. To 
help keep track of their login information for different computers and Web sites, some 
people use a program called a password manager, which stores login information in an 
encrypted form on their devices. You can learn more about password managers by click-
ing the links in the Password Managers section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 6.

INSIGHT
Brute Force Attacks
The system that stores and manages user names and passwords must provide secu-
rity against threats. Most systems store passwords (and sometimes user names) in an 
encrypted format to protect them. Hackers can run programs that create and enter pass-
words from a dictionary or a list of commonly used passwords to break into a system. A 
brute force attack occurs when a hacker uses a program to enter character combina-
tions until the system accepts a user name and password, thereby gaining access to the 
system. (Some systems will send a warning to the computer’s operator or lock out a user 
name when someone makes a predetermined number of unsuccessful attempts to log 
in to a system.) Depending on the system to which the hacker gained access, the dam-
age can range anywhere from reading a person’s email messages to gaining access to 
accounts at financial institutions. Another example of a brute force attack occurs when a 
hacker submits combinations of numbers to a Web site that accepts credit card pay-
ments until the site accepts one. In this case, the hacker can then purchase goods and 
services using the card number that he or she has discovered and stolen.
The countermeasure that protects individuals from becoming victims of brute force 
attacks is to use unique user names and passwords at each Web site that requires a 
login. In addition, users should develop strong passwords that do not include identify-
ing information about themselves (name or birth date, for example), and use a combina-
tion of non-English words, numbers, and characters. Increasing a password’s strength 
makes it more difficult for a brute force attack to obtain the password through trial 
attempts at guessing it.
Because so many Web sites and other Web services require users to create accounts, 
a server needs a way to verify a user when he or she forgets his or her login information. 
User authentication is the process of associating a person and his or her identification 
with a high level of assurance. In other words, authentication techniques give a high level 
of confidence that you are correctly identified when you log in. Authentication counter-
measures include using biometrics, such as a retina scan or fingerprint scan, or asking 
one or more questions to which only the authentic user could know the correct answers. 
The combination of a user login plus a password is called single-factor authentication 
because it uses one factor; in this case, something the user knows (a user name and pass-
word). Multifactor authentication relies on more than one factor. For example, when 
you use your debit card to make a payment at the grocery store, the bank requires that 
you enter a PIN (one factor, something you know) and swipe your card through the card 
reader (a second factor, something you have). A third factor could be something unique 
to the user (for example, a physical characteristic such as a fingerprint or retinal image). 
Banks use multifactor authentication for financial transactions because the risk of loss 
is significant. Another approach that banks and financial institutions use to add security 
to online transactions is multiple layers of control. Multiple layers of control can be 
implemented by using more than one authentication method. For example, most online 
banking sites will require you to answer a challenge question (to which you supplied 
the answer when you set up your account) in addition to supplying the usual login and 
password when its Web server detects that you are trying to access your account from a 
computer that it doesn’t associate with your login.
Digital and Server Certificates
Another method that authenticates a user is to install a digital certificate in the pro-
gram that is being used to send information. A digital certificate is an encrypted and 
password-protected file that contains sufficient information to authenticate and prove a

Tutorial 6 Internet Security | Internet
person’s or an organization’s identity. Usually, a digital certificate contains the following 
information:
• The certificate holder’s name, address, and email address
• A key that “unlocks” the digital certificate, thereby verifying the certificate’s 
authenticity
• The certificate’s expiration date or validity period
• Verification from a trusted third party, called a certificate authority (CA), that authenti-
cates the certificate holder’s identity and issues the digital certificate
A digital certificate is the electronic equivalent of an identification card. For example, 
by looking at a person’s driver’s license, you can verify that person’s identity by compar-
ing the height and eye color printed on the license with the person using the driver’s 
license to authenticate his or her identity. You can also compare the picture on the 
license with the person presenting the license. A digital certificate lets you confirm a 
person’s or an organization’s identity using your Web browser or email program. 
There are two types of digital certificates, although they basically work in the same 
way and provide the same information. Individuals can purchase one type called a 
digital ID. Purchasers of digital IDs can use them to identify themselves to other peo-
ple and to Web sites that are set up to accept digital certificates. Most people who use 
digital IDs are professionals, such as lawyers and accountants, who use email to send 
encrypted, confidential data to clients. The other type of digital certificate is used on 
Web servers and is called a server certificate. A server certificate is installed on a Web 
server to prove the identity of the server to Web clients that connect to it to conduct 
transactions, such as order processing.
A digital ID is an electronic file that you purchase from a certificate authority and 
install into a program that uses it, such as an email program or a Web browser. Because 
a digital certificate is difficult to forge or tamper with, an individual can use one in place 
of a user name and password at some Web sites. The digital ID authenticates the user 
and protects data transferred online from being altered or stolen. Some email programs 
include features that send and receive digital IDs with email messages so recipients can 
use the digital ID to verify the sender’s identity.
A server certificate (sometimes called an SSL Web server certificate) authenticates 
a Web site so site visitors can be confident that the Web site is genuine and not a 
spoofed site. A server certificate also ensures that the transfer of data between a user’s 
computer and the server is encrypted so that it is both tamperproof and free from being 
intercepted. Most Web browsers automatically receive and process server certificates 
without the user doing anything other than clicking a link or entering a URL to make 
the connection to the server. 
Thawte, one of the first certificate authorities to issue server certificates, provides digi-
tal solutions that protect and secure communication and data on the Internet. You can 
explore the Thawte Web site to learn more about server certificates and how they can 
benefit Day-to-Day.

Assurance Providers
An assurance provider is a third party that, for a fee paid by a Web site or an individual, 
will certify that a person or an organization has met some criteria for conducting safe 
transactions and ensuring privacy before issuing the right to use the assurance provider’s 
seal on a Web site. Web sites can display the logo or seal of the assurance provider for 
potential customers to examine. Most of these logos are hyperlinks to the assurance 
provider’s site, at which customers can find more information about the nature of the 
specific assurances given by that provider. Currently, there are four major assurance pro-
viders: the Better Business Bureau (BBB), TRUSTe, Norton Secured Seal, and WebTrust.
The Better Business Bureau’s BBB Accredited Business Seal (formerly BBBOnLine) cer-
tification program grants a Web site the right to use its logo after it has joined the BBB, 
been in business for at least one year, compiled a satisfactory complaint-handling record, 
and agreed to follow BBB member guidelines for truthful advertising, prompt response to 
customer complaints, and binding arbitration of customer disputes. The BBB conducts a 
site visit during which it verifies the street address, telephone number, and existence of 
the business. The BBB page for businesses appears in Figure 6-24.

Tutorial 6 Internet Security | Internet
The TRUSTe program focuses on privacy issues. To earn the right to display the 
TRUSTe logo, a Web site must explain and summarize its information-gathering poli-
cies in a disclosure statement on the site. The site must adhere to its stated policies and 
several other guidelines concerning the privacy of communications. TRUSTe enforces 
its program by various methods, including surprise audits that it and two independent 
accounting firms conduct.
The Norton Secured Seal (formerly VeriSign) provides a range of services to electronic 
commerce Web sites, including certification of secure server status and electronic data 
interchange (EDI) certifications. It is also a partner with the American Institute of Certified 
Public Accountants (AICPA) in the WebTrust program. The WebTrust program is a com-
prehensive assurance that requires reviews by a licensed CPA (or Chartered Accountant 
in Canada) before the site is approved. The review includes examination of Web site per-
formance disclosures, such as delivery times and handling of customer complaints. The 
site is granted a WebTrust logo only after it satisfies a number of criteria relating to busi-
ness practices, transaction integrity, and information protection. The WebTrust program 
requires recertification every 90 days. Links to these assurance providers are included in 
the Assurance Providers and Rating Services section of the Weblinks page for Tutorial 6.
In addition to confirming the services of an assurance provider, a user can examine 
the Web browser itself to assess the security of the connection the browser has with the 
Web server, as you will see next.
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer 
Security (TLS)
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) was the first widely used protocol for establishing secure, 
encrypted connections between Web browsers and Web servers on the Internet. SSL 
was revised several times and is still used today. In 1999, SSL version 3 was improved 
and reissued by the Internet Engineering Task Force. This improved protocol is called 
Transport Layer Security (TLS). Both SSL and TLS automatically provide a security 
“handshake” when a browser and the server to which it is connected want to partici-
pate in a secure connection. Most Web sites automatically switch to a secure state and 
encrypt data when it is necessary to do so, such as when the site requests login or pay-
ment information. Web pages secured by SSL or TLS have URLs that begin with https:// 
instead of http://; the “s” indicates a secure connection. Figure 6-25 shows the Address 
bar for Internet Explorer with a security icon that indicates that the browser has made a 
secure connection to the server at cengagebrain.com. Notice that the URL also includes 
the https:// indicator.
Figure 6-26 shows the Location bar in Firefox, which displays a Web Site Identity indi-
cator to indicate a secure connection. The URL also displays the https:// indicator.

Internet | Tutorial 6 Internet Security
Figure 6-27 shows the Address bar in Chrome, which displays a View site information 
icon to indicate a secure connection. The URL also displays the https:// indicator.
Clicking the security icon in Internet Explorer, clicking the Web Site Identity indicator 
in Firefox, or clicking the View site information icon in Chrome opens a menu that pro-
vides details about the site’s server certificate. Clicking the View certificates link on this 
menu in Internet Explorer, clicking the More Information button on this menu in Firefox, 
or clicking the Certification information link on this menu in Chrome opens a dialog box 
that displays the certificate’s expiration date and identifies the certificate authority that 
issued it.
SSL and TLS both use a public key to encrypt a private key and send it from the Web 
server to the browser. Once the browser decrypts the private key, it uses that private key 
to encrypt information sent to the Web server during the SSL/TLS connection because 
private-key encryption is faster than public-key encryption. When the user leaves the 
secure Web site, the browser terminates the SSL/TLS connection and discards these tem-
porary keys, or session keys. Session keys exist only during a single connection (session) 
between a browser and a server.
Although the use of SSL and TLS increased Web users’ confidence when using online 
shopping and banking sites, some certificate authorities were only performing the 
minimum level of verification of applicants for SSL certificates before issuing them. A 
growing concern that fraudulent Web sites (including phishing sites) might have obtained 
SSL certificates led a group of certificate authorities to develop a more stringent set of 
verification steps. In 2008, this development led to the establishment of stricter criteria 
and an assurance of a more consistent application of verification procedures. Certificate 
authorities that followed these more extensive verification procedures were permitted to 
issue a new type of certificate called Secure Sockets Layer-Extended Validation (SSL-EV). 
Before issuing an SSL-EV certificate, a certificate authority must confirm the legal 
existence of the organization by verifying the organization’s registered legal name, regis-
tration number, registered address, and physical business address. The certificate author-
ity also must verify the organization’s right to use the domain name, and verify that the 
organization has authorized the request for an SSL-EV certificate. You can tell that you 
are visiting a Web site that has an SSL-EV certificate by looking at the Address bar for 
your browser. In Internet Explorer, the background of the Address bar turns green and the 
verified name of the organization appears to the right of the URL and alternates with the 
name of the certificate authority, as shown in Figure 6-28.

Case Problem 2
There are no Data Files needed for this Case Problem.
Westway Medical Practice  Dr. Cary Grimes owns and operates a small family prac-
tice clinic that provides routine and preventive medical care for patients of all ages. Dr. 
Grimes recently began asking clients for their communication preferences when the 
office sends them results from routine lab work and other medical tests. Overwhelmingly, 
his clients would like to receive their results by email instead of through the postal 
service. Dr. Grimes realizes that the office could save substantial time and money by 
using email to send patients their results. However, sending results by email is governed 
by a federal law called HIPAA (which stands for the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996) that requires him to protect the confidentiality of medical 
data sent electronically to patients. You’ll help Dr. Grimes find an electronic solution for 
sending medical data to patients by completing the following steps:
 1. Start your Web browser, go to www.cengagebrain.com, open the Tutorial 6 Weblinks 
page, and then click the Case Problem 2 link. Click the HHS.gov: Health Information 
Privacy link to open a page at the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 
which is the agency responsible for administering health and human services in the 
United States.
 2. Use the links on the page to review the protections available to consumers and to 
get a sense of the kind of information that must be protected and how it must be 
protected, paying particular attention to communications about a person’s medi-
cal records between a medical office and a patient. Use the HHS site to learn more 
about who must follow the HIPAA laws, again paying particular attention to require-
ments for a medical office.
 3. Return to the HHS page and explore the links on the page for “covered entities.”

other medical provider using email to communicate with a patient.
 4. When you are finished reviewing the HHS site, return to the Weblinks page for Case 
Problem 2. Click one of the links in the Secure Email section. 
 5. Explore the site you selected to determine if it satisfies the HIPAA requirements and 
provides an encrypted email solution for Dr. Grimes. As you explore the site, pay 
particular attention to how the service works, its cost, and whether you would con-
sider recommending it for the Westway Medical Practice.
 6. Return to the Weblinks page, and then click a link to another site in the Secure Email 
section. Repeat Step 5 to determine if the services provided by the second site might 
work for Dr. Grimes.
 7. In an email message addressed to your instructor, briefly explain why the office can 
or cannot use email to communicate with patients. If the office can use email to 
communicate with patients, recommend a service that it can use to protect the data 
as required by HIPAA. If the office cannot use email to communicate with patients, 
explain the reasons why and provide specific details for your response. 
 8. Based on your findings, recommend a course of action for Dr. Grimes. You can base 
your recommendation on cost, ease of use, federal law, or other considerations that 
affect your decision.

Case	|	Mobile Vet Services
Ruby Wilson began her career as a staff physician at a local vet-
erinary hospital in Dallas, Texas. Many of her clients were senior 
citizens or disabled individuals, and they often commented that 
getting to the vet hospital was challenging. Ruby started Mobile 
Vet Services, a company that uses outfitted recreational vehicles 
to provide routine pet care, such as immunizations, simple surgi-
cal procedures such as biopsies and neutering, lab services and 
X-ray procedures, and emergency care. Her business employs three 
veterinarians, two veterinary technicians, and three mobile clinics. 
In addition, she has an office in Dallas that serves as a base location 
for staff members and facilities for other services, such as pet board-
ing, advanced surgical procedures, and long-term care for animals 
who are ill or recovering from surgery.
One challenge of working in a mobile vet clinic has been main-
taining good communication between the main office and mobile 
staff members. The vets use cell phones to talk to the office, to 
each other, and to clients. However, because the vets are not using 
communication methods that let them easily retrieve a lab report or 
X-ray image, they are forced to drive back to the office to pick up 
these items throughout the day. 
Ruby has hired you as the new office manager. Your first task is 
to identify ways to improve the clinic’s communication, not only 
among employees, but also between the clinic and its clients. In 
your previous position as an assistant communications director 
for a company that sold wireless communication devices, you are 
already familiar with many ways to expand and enhance mobile 
communication. You begin your research by examining different 
ways to improve communication at Mobile Vet Services.

First-generation (1G) wireless 
networks transmit data at a 
very slow rate of up to 9.6 Kbps 
(kilobits per second) from one 
location to another through cell 
phone towers.
Second-generation (2G) wireless 
networks transmit data at a 
rate of up to 14.4 Kbps, which 
is still very slow. 2.5G wireless 
networks are faster, transmitting 
data at a rate of up to 144 to 
384 Kbps.
First-generation (1G) 
wireless devices transmit 
voice data only.
Second-generation (2G) wireless devices 
transmit voice and small amounts of 
unformatted data. 2G devices initially 
use Short Message Service (SMS) to 
send and receive data in the form of text 
messages. Later 2G devices and 2.5G 
devices send and receive some formatted 
data and can display simple Web pages.

WIRELESS DEVICES TIMELINE
Third-generation (3G) wireless devices transmit voice and 
formatted data. As networks spread geographically, devices 
roam easily without losing their network connections. Devices 
can browse the Web, send and receive email, and transfer 
large files to other users, in addition to SMS and phone calls. 
Devices also begin to include operating systems, which run 
programs that expand the device’s utility to be more of a 
personal computer than just a mobile phone.
Fourth-generation (4G) wireless 
devices transmit voice and formatted 
data. Because the transfer rate is 
so fast, devices can easily process 
multiple tasks simultaneously. All 
devices include an operating system 
that lets the devices run applications.
Third-generation (3G) wireless 
networks transmit data very 
quickly at rates of up to  
2 Mbps (megabits per 
second), and 3.5G networks 
transmit data even faster, at 
rates of up to 10 Mbps.
Fourth-generation (4G) wireless 
networks transmit data extremely 
fast at rates of 50 Mbps in 2011, 
with the goal of transmitting data 
at a rate of up to 100 Mbps or 
faster as networks become fully 
operational.

The Evolution of Wireless Networks
When you connect a device such as a computer to an Internet service provider (ISP) 
using a phone line, cable modem, or DSL modem, you’re creating a wired connection 
because the connection between the device and the ISP uses a cable. A wireless  
connection occurs when data, such as a file or a person’s voice, is transferred to another 
location without the use of any wires. As shown in the timeline in the Visual Overview 
for this session, the first wireless technology was used in 1978, when a voice-only 
network was started in Chicago and operated on an analog cellular network capable of 
sending data very slowly by today’s standards. These analog cellular networks and the 
cell phones connected to them were called first-generation (1G) wireless networks.
First-generation cell phones, like the one shown in the Session 7.1 Visual Overview, 
were some of the first wireless devices to transfer a person’s voice. Eventually, cell phone 
manufacturers found a way to support and send text data over the same connection. Your 
cell phone probably lets you send and receive very short (up to 160 characters), text-
only messages and read them using your phone’s display area. This message, called a 
text message because it contains only alphanumeric characters, is a simple message that 
devices can send to other devices connected to the same or different types of networks. 
This kind of data transfer occurs over second-generation (2G) wireless networks. The 2G 
standard transfers data slightly faster than 1G networks, but still much slower than the 
speed you would experience using a wired device. The 2G wireless data transfer rate is 
adequate for voice conversations and text messages, but it’s extremely slow when you’re 
trying to receive formatted information, such as a Web page. The primary data sent over 
a 2G network, other than voice conversations, is mostly text messages.
In 1994, carriers created digital networks, or Personal Communication Service (PCS), 
on which data was transmitted in bits at a rate of up to 14.4 Kbps. In 1999, the first wire-
less connections were made to the Internet. At first, the technology was expensive and 
slow, with poor user interfaces and compatibility problems between mobile devices such 
as personal digital assistants and cellular phones. A personal digital assistant (PDA) is a 
handheld computer that can send and receive wireless telephone and fax calls, act as a 
personal organizer, perform calculations, store notes, and, in most cases, use a browser 
to display Web pages. Many PDAs and cell phones perform all of these functions, and 
they might even have a Global Positioning System (GPS) that displays maps and direc-
tions to places around the globe, and a camera and music player.
As cell phone carriers were converting their old analog cellular networks to digital 
networks (in other words, moving from first-generation to second-generation wireless), 
PDAs and other handheld computers were growing in popularity for business profession-
als. Some PDAs and other devices used infrared technology to “beam” information from 
one source to another without the use of wired connections. This infrared technology 
initially eliminated the need for wired connections to share data between devices, but its 
limitations in range increased the need for other wireless methods of transferring data.
In some parts of the United States and the world, 2G wireless networks still provide 
digital voice services and Short Message Service (SMS). However, most U.S. and world-
wide carriers have upgraded their networks to third-generation (3G) wireless networks. 
The 3G wireless networks offer very fast transfer rates and constant connections. The 
speed of the 3G network transfer rates enables you to use a wireless device to display 
Web pages, play MP3 files, watch a video, make and receive phone calls, and send 
and receive email and text messages. When mobile devices combine the functionality 
of a cell phone with an operating system that performs these and other functions, they 
are usually called smartphones. Each year, changes and enhancements in technology 
result in an increasing global market for smartphones. Figure 7-1 shows several popu-
lar smartphones, all of which let the user perform many operations, including sending 
and receiving email messages, making and receiving phone calls, using a browser to 
access the Internet, playing and recording audio and video files, and using applications 
to open, edit, and create documents, spreadsheets, PDF files, presentations, and other 
types of files.
SMS (more commonly 
called text messaging) is 
still one of today’s most 
widely used and popular 
forms of communication 
methods, with millions of 
text messages sent each 
day using wireless devices 
around the world.

Tutorial 7 Wireless Networking | Internet
 
When establishing nationwide 3G wireless networks in the United States, carriers 
originally faced two major obstacles. The first was bandwidth. 3G wireless networks 
must operate in a spectrum where radio frequencies can carry data, and the U.S. gov-
ernment authorizes the use of the spectrum on which 3G wireless networks operate. 
The second obstacle was cost. Carriers of 3G wireless signals had to purchase licenses 
to operate 3G wireless networks, and then they had to build cellular transmitters and 
radio towers to carry the signals. The challenges of converting from 2G to 3G wireless 
networks were similar to the challenges of converting from analog to digital cellular 
networks that occurred in the 1990s: The carriers had to invest in technology to make 
the change. In Europe, the licenses alone have cost carriers more than $95 billion and 
the cost of building 3G wireless networks has exceeded $125 billion. Much like the 
early days of cell phones, the technology is only as good as the network and its coverage 
area. Most U.S. carriers now offer nationwide 3G service, with the exception of limited 
geographical areas that are mostly rural. These carriers have also successfully established 
partnerships with the manufacturers of the devices and hardware that operate on their 
3G networks.
Between 2G and 3G networks, many carriers transformed and upgraded their existing 
networks to create 2.5G wireless networks that deliver faster transfer speeds than the 2G 
networks. These 2.5G networks allow devices to send files, such as pictures taken with 
a camera phone, to other users, and to access the Internet. In some areas of the United 
States where 3G service is unavailable, a device might automatically connect to the 
2.5G network. In many cases, the user is unaware of the connection to another network.
The wireless network that followed 3G wireless, which is called a 3.5G wireless 
network or mobile broadband, provides very fast network connections. By 2009, 3.5G 
wireless networks existed in the United States, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, China, 
Israel, Argentina, Brazil, Sweden, Norway, and South Korea, and 3.5G networks were 
being planned and tested in other countries, as well.
In 2010, some carriers created the first, although limited, fourth-generation wireless 
networks (4G wireless). 4G technology provides very fast network connection speeds 
and delivers high-quality audio and video to wireless devices. 4G networks will make it 
possible for a wireless device to move between the different wireless networks without 
losing their signals. Because of the tremendous amount of data that 4G wireless net-
works can send and receive, users can perform multiple tasks on their 4G devices, such 
as talking on the phone and browsing a Web page simultaneously. Because the devices 
connected to 4G wireless networks can process many tasks at the same time, this feature 
is sometimes called simultaneous support.

Internet | Tutorial 7 Wireless Networking
As the number of wireless Internet users continues to increase, more devices will be 
manufactured to support wireless technology. However, a single network standard on 
which to transmit information has not yet been developed. It is important for consumers 
to understand that a wireless device is usually manufactured to work only on a single 
type of network; the networks of the various carriers use different frequencies on the 
radio spectrum. If you purchase a smartphone for a specific carrier to work on its 3G or 
4G network, for example, you might not be able to use that smartphone if you switch 
your service to another network carrier because your device operates on a different fre-
quency. Consumers must be sure to select the wireless device that will pick up a signal 
in areas of the world where they will use it.
Cellular was the first industry to create wireless connections that served large geo-
graphical areas. Soon after the creation of cellular networks, engineers developed other 
ways to create wireless networks with different types of devices. Generally, you can 
classify wireless networking into four categories: wireless local area networking, wire-
less personal area networking, wireless wide area networking, and metropolitan area 
networking. It is important to understand each type of network and the technologies 
used on it, so you can determine the correct wireless devices needed to connect to the 
network. Some of these wireless options provide opportunities for Mobile Vet Services 
employees to send and receive important data regardless of the location from which they 
are conducting business. You will investigate how the different wireless networks and 
devices can help the Mobile Vet Services employees stay in touch with clients, the main 
office staff, and each other.
Wireless Local Area Networking
A wireless local area network (WLAN) is a network on which devices use high-
frequency radio waves instead of wires to communicate with a base station, which is 
connected to the Internet. When most people talk about wireless LANs, they are usually 
referring to the most common type of wireless network, which is created using the Wi-Fi 
standard. New computers and all kinds of wireless devices are equipped with Wi-Fi, or 
wireless fidelity, which is the trademarked name of the Wi-Fi Alliance that specifies the 
interface between a wireless client and a base station, or between two wireless clients, 
to create a hotspot, or an area of network coverage. The Wi-Fi Alliance is a not-for-profit 
organization that certifies interoperability of Wi-Fi products and promotes Wi-Fi as a 
standard for wireless LANs. Wi-Fi is frequently found in restaurants, stores, and other 
places where people gather and use wireless devices to access the Internet. Wi-Fi is also 
used to connect users who are playing electronic games and to connect other types of 
devices, such as cameras, to the Internet. Many Wi-Fi devices operate in the 2.4 GHz 
(gigahertz) radio spectrum, which is the same spectrum used by cordless phones, garage 
door openers, microwave ovens, and other devices. Because this spectrum is unlicensed, 
it is free. Figure 7-2 compares a traditional wired local area network to a WLAN.

Tutorial 7 Wireless Networking | Internet
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) classifies WLANs using dif-
ferent wireless network standards. Four of the most widely used standards are 802.11a, 
802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n; for this reason, some people call a wireless LAN an 
802.11 network because of the network standard on which Wi-Fi operates. The primary 
difference between these standards is the radio frequency at which they transmit, the 
transfer rate of data over the network, and the range at which they operate. The  
transfer rate of data is the speed at which data is transmitted from an access point (or 
base station) to a wireless device. An access point is a hardware device with one or more 
antennae that permit communication between wired and wireless networks so wireless 
clients can send and receive data. Generally speaking, the closer the wireless device is 
to the access point, the faster the transfer rate. The range is the physical distance between 
the access point and the wireless device. Most ranges are averages; the range will vary 
depending on the physical impediments, such as walls, between the access point and 
the wireless device. In addition, the transfer rate might be reduced when many devices 
using the same radio frequency are present in close proximity to the access point.
The term “Wi-Fi” most often refers to the 802.11b standard, which is the one on 
which most Wi-Fi devices operate. Devices that use the same wireless network stan-
dard are compatible with each other. However, the different standards are generally not 
interoperable; so a device configured for 802.11a is not necessarily compatible with 
a device configured for 802.11b. A device called a dual band access point makes it 
possible to connect devices configured for different Wi-Fi standards to the same access 
point, and a multiple band access point makes it possible to connect any wireless device 
to the same access point. However, most businesses will invest in devices created for 
only one wireless network standard because it is usually less expensive and less techni-
cally complicated to do so.
In business settings, Wi-Fi is often used as an alternative in a building or other area 
in which you might find a traditional wired local area network (LAN); in cases where 
wiring cannot be installed, wireless networks might be the only way to connect devices 
to a LAN for Internet access. Wi-Fi is also a popular way to configure wireless devices in 
homes, especially when rooms in the house where an Internet connection is desired do 
not have phone or cable outlets. Millions of U.S. households use Wi-Fi to create wireless 
home networks. As wireless technology becomes more affordable, the number of home 
wireless networks is expected to increase dramatically worldwide.

Internet | Tutorial 7 Wireless Networking
New notebook computers and other wireless devices are manufactured with Wi-Fi 
compatible hardware installed in them and software that locates a Wi-Fi signal and auto-
matically initiates the connection to the wireless network. Because Wi-Fi certified hard-
ware and devices must meet the requirements of the Wi-Fi Alliance for 802.11 wireless 
standards, any Wi-Fi certified device can connect to any 802.11 certified access point to 
send and receive signals. A hardware device or a computer running specialized software 
serves as a central point for wireless clients and provides a connection to the wireless 
network. These access points already exist in most hotels, airports, convention centers, 
restaurants, and other public locations across the United States. As long as you are using 
Wi-Fi certified technology, you can connect to the WLAN when you are within the range 
of the network and have permission to access it. In most cases, network connections are 
possible within 200 to 900 feet of the access point, depending on the network standard, 
surrounding architecture, and other obstacles to the radio waves.
When businesses first started offering Wi-Fi to their customers, many of them charged 
a fee for its use. Many hotels and retail chains still charge daily fees of up to $15 or more 
for Wi-Fi connections. However, realizing that Wi-Fi is a way to attract customers and 
keep them in their businesses, some retailers have changed their Wi-Fi strategies to offer 
free use instead of paid or limited use. Many hotels now offer free Wi-Fi and access to a 
business center that includes printers and other electronic devices that guests can use at 
no charge as a way to increase brand loyalty among frequent travelers. Figure 7-3 shows 
the Web the page for Holiday Inn Express that describes its services for potential visitors.

If you position enough access points within the appropriate range of each other, the 
WLAN can grow to cover an entire office complex or other geographic area. For exam-
ple, a movement in Seattle in 2001 called for people to put 802.11b access points in 
their homes and offices, creating a network of access points and an expanded wireless 
network in the city. You could take your wireless device all over town and still connect to 
the Internet using the wireless network. But if you traveled outside of Seattle, you would 
either need to find another access point or use an alternate method to connect to the 
Internet because you would be out of range of Seattle’s wireless network.
In 2004 and 2005, several U.S. cities deployed city-wide Wi-Fi networks in an effort 
to make affordable Internet connections part of the city’s basic services. These city-
wide wireless networks are often called municipal broadband, Muni Wi-Fi, or Muni-Fi 
networks to characterize the wireless network coverage area in terms of a city instead of 
as a hotspot. However, these networks have faced financing, infrastructure, and man-
agement problems. In 2007, Wireless Philadelphia (which became known as Digital 
Impact Group) was a not-for-profit organization with the goal of creating the nation’s 
largest Wi-Fi network by providing wireless services to individuals and businesses in an 
area of 135 square miles. Despite support from the community and its leaders, Wireless 
Philadelphia has struggled to meet its goals, and is now in danger of becoming one of 
many failed attempts at providing Muni Wi-Fi in an urban area.
Ruby wants more information about how Mobile Vet Services can use wireless 
devices to communicate. You will investigate a WLAN option for Mobile Vet Services 
next by searching for information about WLANs using the Web sites of different compa-
nies that produce devices that operate on them.
To find information about WLANs:

2.	 Find the heading Wireless LANs and then click one of the businesses listed to 
open the site.
Follow the links on the site to learn more about WLAN topics, such as how these 
networks are configured, the necessary hardware to install them, and other gen-
eral information that you feel might help you understand the technical require-
ments, advantages, and disadvantages of using a WLAN for Mobile Vet Services. 
You do not need to obtain detailed information about the specific hardware 
that the business sells; your research should focus on general information about 
WLANs. If the site provides links to demonstrations and your browser can display 
them, explore these demos to learn more about wireless technology.

Some sites might provide specific information about how to set up a WLAN for 
Mobile Vet Services. Using Wi-Fi might be a good solution for giving employees some 
flexibility in where they do their work, either by creating a Wi-Fi network in the main 
office or by giving them information about where to connect to existing Wi-Fi networks 
in local businesses.

A different type of WLAN that might interest Ruby is MiFi, a small wireless router 
that a user keeps in a pocket or briefcase and that provides a battery-operated, mobile, 
personal hotspot for connecting Wi-Fi devices to the Internet. Produced by Novatel and 
obtaining its broadband signal through a nationwide cellular service, this device cre-
ates a mobile Internet connection for Wi-Fi devices. The MiFi device uses a rechargeable 
battery that operates for several hours before requiring a charge. The hotspot created by 
MiFi is password protected and can be used to connect as many as five Wi-Fi devices 
located within 30 feet of the MiFi device to the Internet. When you want to provide 
other Wi-Fi devices with Internet access through your MiFi hotspot, you simply give the 
user the password for your MiFi hotspot, which is usually located on the MiFi device. To 
create a MiFi hotspot, you must first purchase the Novatel device, and then subscribe to 
a participating broadband service provider. MiFi works anywhere in the United States 
where the broadband service provider’s network is available. Because MiFi doesn’t use 
any wires for its power source or signal, it is an excellent option for mobile Internet 
connectivity. Figure 7-4 shows the Mobile Broadband page for Verizon Wireless, which 
includes MiFi as one of its mobile broadband services.
Wireless Mesh Networks
Another type of wireless local area network is a wireless mesh network, which is com-
monly used to extend the reach of Wi-Fi hotspots to an enterprise, such as a university 
campus, hotel, airport terminal, convention center, sports arena, large office building, or 
an apartment complex. Unlike a traditional WLAN, in which devices connect through 
the network to a router that is connected to the Internet, a wireless mesh network is a

series of self-configuring wireless nodes (these nodes are usually access points) that com-
municate with each other to relay communication across the network. The advantage 
of a wireless mesh network is that as new nodes are installed in the vicinity of the mesh 
network, they automatically configure themselves to work without the use of cables. 
Similarly, when a node in the mesh network fails, communication is automatically 
routed around the failed node with little overall loss to the entire network. 
Perhaps the most important feature of a mesh network is that only one of the nodes 
needs to be wired to the Internet, and then it shares that connection with the other nodes 
in the network, which automatically determine the best way to transmit data over the 
entire network. In other words, communication doesn’t always go through the router 
that is connected to the network like it does in a Wi-Fi network—communication goes 
through the nodes, which transmit data to the next node and act as an access point in 
the network. This type of wireless network is generally more expensive to create than 
Wi-Fi hotspots, but it is more effective and efficient at covering large areas with wire-
less connections because each node is wirelessly connected to the network—not to 
the router with cables—and each node requires very little power to operate. Figure 7-5 
shows an example of a wireless mesh network. Each node might be physically stored on 
a different floor of an office building or in a different area of an apartment complex to 
cover the entire geographical area of the structure being connected.
Wireless mesh networks are attractive to organizations trying to provide wireless 
coverage to a large geographical area. These networks are also frequently found inside 
buildings, ports, and airport terminals as a method of controlling information from auto-
mated services, such as temperature controls, security systems, and fire alarms—all of 
which use sensors to monitor the operations and status of a large building. In a wireless 
mesh network, these sensors are linked together through the network and communicate 
with each other, providing a very reliable and affordable way to monitor the systems in a 
building or other area.
Ruby wonders if there is a way for staff members to share devices and peripherals 
without having to install an access point or a wireless mesh network. You will research 
some options for personal area networks to answer her question.

Personal Area Networking
Personal area networking (PAN) refers to the wireless network that connects personal 
devices to each other, such as a connection between a smartphone and a wireless head-
set, or between a notebook computer and a printer. The two major types of personal area 
networks are infrared and Bluetooth.
Infrared Technology
The Infrared Data Association (IrDA) is a group dedicated to developing low-cost, high-
speed wireless connectivity solutions. Using infrared technology, you can wirelessly 
beam information at up to 4 Mbps from one device to another compatible device using 
infrared light waves. Infrared provides convenient wireless connections, but there are 
some limitations. The devices must be compatible and in a direct line of sight with each 
other for the waves to reach their destinations. In other words, you can’t beam informa-
tion across a room, through a wall, or around a corner. Because infrared uses light waves 
to carry data, it doesn’t interfere with technologies that use radio waves. Originally, this 
technology was used to provide wireless connections for some computer devices, such 
as printers. However, now it is used almost exclusively for other types of devices, such as 
remote controls and cameras, where infrared provides a wireless connection that is not 
subject to interference from or with other wireless devices.
Bluetooth
The most popular technology in personal area networking, Bluetooth, lets you con-
nect compatible devices using radio waves. Named after a 10th century Danish king, 
Bluetooth provides short-range connections between computers, handheld devices, 
smartphones, wireless headsets, printers, and other electronic devices. These devices 
are manufactured with hardware that enables them to receive Bluetooth radio waves. 
Thousands of Bluetooth-enabled products are on the market, including built-in Bluetooth 
support in certain Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Lexus, Acura, Land Rover, Audi, 
and Lincoln automobiles. Unlike a WLAN, Bluetooth doesn’t need an access point for 
communication; compatible devices establish their communication with each other 
automatically. If you want to connect a Bluetooth-enabled device to the Internet, some 
manufacturers produce Bluetooth access points that function much like their Wi-Fi coun-
terparts in that they connect Bluetooth-enabled devices to a wired network that provides 
Internet access.
Bluetooth isn’t really “owned” by any specific manufacturer or group; according to 
the official Bluetooth Web site, the goal of the Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group) 
is to “strengthen the Bluetooth brand by empowering SIG members to collaborate and 
innovate, creating the preferred wireless technology to connect diverse devices.” The 
Bluetooth SIG promoters include Ericsson, Intel, Lenovo, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia, 
and Toshiba, along with more than 13,000 associate and adopter member companies; 
these companies are actively creating new and very creative ways to use Bluetooth 
technology, and are manufacturing products in the computer, audio, video, medical, per-
sonal health, and many other industries to support it. Figure 7-6 shows the home page 
for the Bluetooth SIG Web site.
Devices that work in a 
personal area network are 
sometimes called PAN 
devices.

Because all Bluetooth-enabled devices must be certified and tested to meet current 
product specifications, they are compatible with each other regardless of the type of 
device or manufacturer. Figure 7-7 shows how you might use Bluetooth to create a wire-
less PAN to connect your electronic devices. When you have visitors to your office, their 
Bluetooth-enabled devices can also connect to your devices. Because some car models 
include Bluetooth-enabled phones, you can extend your PAN to include the use of some 
devices while in your car.

Using Bluetooth technology, you can synchronize and share data among as many as 
eight Bluetooth-enabled devices within the specified range, usually from 3 to 300 feet, at 
rates of 1 to 3 Mbps. A collection of devices connected in a personal area network using 
Bluetooth technology is called a piconet. A piconet can connect two to eight devices at 
a time. However, all devices connected in a piconet must have identical configurations. 
In a piconet, one device acts as a master during the connection. You can connect picon-
ets with up to eight devices to each other, allowing you to share information between the 
master devices. You can use Bluetooth-enabled devices to transfer files, listen to music 
playing on an iPod through a wireless headset, print documents from your office or from 
another office with a Bluetooth-enabled printer, or use a wireless headset to talk on a 
smartphone or the integrated phone in your car. Because Bluetooth uses radio waves, the 
devices must be located within the specified range; but the waves can send data around 
the corner, down the hall, or from your briefcase, without requiring a direct line of sight. 
Bluetooth might seem similar to Wi-Fi, but it’s not. Figure 7-8 compares wireless network 
standards to Bluetooth.

Wireless Wide Area Networking
Many devices have been capable of making wireless Internet connections since 1999, 
but they were plagued by slow data-transfer speeds, limited interactivity, poor user inter-
faces, and the limited geographical area of the networks on which they operated.
Devices connecting to a WLAN based on Wi-Fi or to a wireless mesh network must 
be within the stated boundary of the WLAN. You can use your notebook computer to 
make a wireless network connection in your office, the conference room, or any other 
location within the WLAN’s range. However, when you’re waiting for a plane at the air-
port or sitting in a hotel room in another state or country, you must use another network 
to connect to the Internet.
Wireless wide area networking (WWAN) makes it possible to access the Internet 
from anywhere within the boundaries of the WWAN. As its name implies, a WWAN is a 
wireless network that provides network coverage to a large geographical area. WWANs 
provide wireless connections to the Internet using 3G and 4G networks created by 
nationwide cellular phone carriers. To access the Internet using a WWAN, you need an 
integrated or separate WWAN PC card (also called a mobile broadband card, Aircard, or 
USB modem) for the device that you want to use and an account with the cellular carrier 
that operates the network. Once you have a compatible device and an account, you can 
connect your device to the WWAN and access the Internet from any location where the 
cellular phone carrier has a signal. For this reason, a WWAN is an excellent option for 
traveling professionals who need Internet access from many different geographical loca-
tions and other areas where Wi-Fi service isn’t available. Unlike Wi-Fi connectivity, as 
you travel, your device will remain connected for as long as the device can receive the 
cellular phone carrier’s signal.

INSIGHT
Mobile Wireless Broadband Connections
Most nationwide cellular phone carriers offer consumers wireless Internet service for a 
daily or monthly rate, and they sell the necessary wireless broadband card or modem. 
Before purchasing the necessary devices and signing up for wireless Internet service, 
check the cellular carrier’s broadband network coverage maps and make sure that you 
will be able to pick up the carrier’s signal in places where you’ll need to connect to the 
Internet. The coverage area might be identical to where you can get cell phone recep-
tion, but this is not always the case, so it’s important to check the correct map for wire-
less service.
Wireless broadband cards and modems are very affordable, but some carriers require 
a two-year contract for the service when you purchase the device or service. Be sure to 
understand the contract terms before making a purchase; if you purchase the device 
or sign up for the service and sign a contract, you might be subject to fines and other 
fees if you cancel the agreement before the end of the term. With so many broadband 
options available, you never know when a more affordable option might present itself, 
so it’s a good idea to look for short-term solutions that match your budget.
Ruby might want to consider connecting the mobile clinics using WWAN technolo-
gies because this option would make it possible for mobile connections during the 
workday.
Metropolitan Area Networking
The final networking technology Ruby wants you to explore is metropolitan area net-
working, the goal of which is to enable wireless networking across broad geographical 
areas. A metropolitan area network (MAN) provides wireless broadband Internet service 
to large geographical areas, usually in hotspots of several square miles each, and con-
nects these hotspots using technology similar to cellular service to create a very large 
area of network coverage. The two competing standards in this area are WiMAX and LTE, 
both of which promise to deliver 4G networks around the world.
Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)
Similar to Wi-Fi but operating in a different radio spectrum and using a different net-
work standard, WiMAX creates a connected area of network coverage, but in a much 
larger area than a Wi-Fi hotspot. WiMAX transmitters are usually mounted on the tops 
of buildings and on existing cellular towers to create network hotspots of up to 10 or 
more square miles. WiMAX works by connecting a WiMAX tower to an ISP that pro-
vides the Internet service. The WiMAX towers are connected to each other via radio 
signals. WiMAX transmitters, which can be located up to 10 to 30 miles from the towers, 
send the signal to homes, businesses, and mobile devices that have WiMAX receiv-
ers. Subscribers can plug the WiMAX receiver into their existing local area networks to 
provide high-speed Internet access to all of their connected devices, or use a separate 
or built-in WiMAX modem to connect a mobile device to the network. Figure 7-9 shows 
how WiMAX works.

Tutorial 7 Wireless Networking | Internet
WiMAX uses the 802.16 standards defined by the IEEE for metropolitan area net-
works, and broadcasts in the 2 to 11 GHz and 10 to 66 GHz radio spectrum. A WiMAX 
coverage area between the base station and devices varies based on the geography of the 
area, but most of these hotspots are approximately 10 square miles and operate at speeds 
of up to 70 Mbps. When multiple WiMAX towers are connected to each other, WiMAX 
has the potential to solve some of the geographical and speed limitations of wired net-
works and other wireless networks, including Wi-Fi. For example, the wireless service 
of many carriers is limited by the coverage area of the network, and Wi-Fi is limited by 
the number of access points that are connected to each other to form a network. Both of 
these options provide wireless Internet access, but not at the same speed of a broadband 
connection such as DSL or a cable modem.

Internet | Tutorial 7 Wireless Networking
Since 2005, WiMAX has operated in numerous major metropolitan markets, including 
New York City. In New York City, WiMAX provider Towerstream installed WiMAX tow-
ers and WiMAX receivers on rooftops and in office windows of a dense part of the city. 
Towerstream’s customers simply plug the WiMAX receiver into their existing local area 
network, replacing the need for high-speed phone lines or cables. Because the WiMAX 
signal is so strong, it can serve numerous customers simultaneously. Since its inception, 
many major U.S. markets, including San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle, Boston, Dallas-Fort 
Worth, Tampa Bay, Detroit, Portland, Atlanta, and Miami, are served by WiMAX service 
from different carriers.
WiMAX was originally developed for and is still used to provide “last mile coverage” 
to remote areas of the world where no cable or telephone lines exist for wired Internet 
connections. In New Zealand, provider Broadcast Communications, Ltd., used WiMAX 
to bring high-speed Internet connections to remote areas where no cable or telephone 
lines exist for wired high-speed Internet connections. As early as 2005, nearly half of all 
New Zealand households, many of which would never benefit from high-speed wired 
broadband because of geographical limitations, had high-speed wireless Internet con-
nections provided by WiMAX.
WiMAX also works for mobile devices, making it possible for users to roam between 
Wi-Fi hotspots and WiMAX coverage areas. Because WiMAX can support many types of 
data transmissions, it is also used for VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), which con-
verts audio signals to digital packets so that you can use a broadband wired or wireless 
Internet connection to make local and long-distance telephone calls. Most new desktop 
and notebook computers and wireless devices have built-in 802.16 cards, as well, which 
lets them use WiMAX for their Internet service. For older computers and devices, con-
sumers can purchase the required equipment and install it, much like what is available 
now for Wi-Fi devices.
Ruby wants to learn more about WiMAX so she can anticipate the hardware and other 
considerations necessary for Mobile Vet Services to use it.

Long Term Evolution (LTE)
Long Term Evolution (LTE) provides 4G wireless broadband connections at very fast 
speeds to large geographical areas in the United States and in many other areas of the 
world. Similar to WiMAX, users can connect smartphones and other types of mobile 
devices to an LTE network for mobile broadband service.
Since 2010, several cellular carriers have built 4G LTE networks for customers with 
4G devices in dozens of metropolitan areas. When outside the LTE network’s coverage 
area, these 4G devices automatically connect to the carrier’s 3G network for their sig-
nals. Some carriers, including AT&T and Verizon Wireless, hope to have nationwide LTE 
4G networks in operation by 2013 or 2015. In the meantime, customers with 4G devices 
should notice faster connections when they are in range of the LTE network.
LTE operates in the radio spectrum from 1.4 MHz to 20 MHz; but most U.S. carriers 
will operate at 700 MHz, where there is no interference and nationwide availability. LTE 
has very fast download speeds of up to 100 Mbps and upload speeds of up to 50 Mbps. 
In some parts of the world, LTE is being used for residential and commercial broadband 
service; but in the United States, LTE is being developed primarily for mobile devices. 
Smartphones are being manufactured with embedded modems to connect to the LTE 
network. For other types of devices, such as notebook computers, users can install a USB 
device to connect to the network, much like you would use a USB device to connect 
to a 3G network. In areas where the LTE signal is not as strong, such as indoors, users 
can connect a device called a femtocell to an existing wired network to improve the 
performance and signals of their LTE devices. A femtocell is a base station that uses mini-
mal power to transmit the LTE signal from a wired connection, such as a cable or DSL 
modem, to LTE devices within its range to increase their speed. 
Ruby wants to learn more about LTE so she can evaluate it for future use. She also 
wants to get a sense of how WiMAX and LTE markets might develop, and the support 
various technology manufacturers have for each network.

4G services by the end of 2013.
A femtocell is also called a 
Home eNode when used 
for LTE devices.

Decision Making: Choosing a Mobile Broadband Provider
As manufacturers continue expanding their product lines to include more 4G smartphones, 
and cellular carriers continue expanding and enhancing their existing networks to provide 
4G network services in more areas, consumers will begin seeing 4G smartphones and 
network services across the United States, in addition to existing nationwide 3G services. 
How and—more importantly—when should consumers and businesses decide to upgrade 
to this new technology? 
In 2011, the two competing 4G network standards, WiMAX and LTE, were in their early 
stages of development in the United States, but experts disagreed on which standard 
would be the predominant or prevailing network. WiMAX has an advantage in that it  
is generally less expensive to implement and operate than LTE. In 2010, more than  
120 million customers in many parts of the United States already used WiMAX for their 
wireless Internet connections. However, LTE has the advantage of two of the nation’s larg-
est cellular carriers—AT&T and Verizon Wireless—investing in building LTE networks and 
providing services starting in 2011 to millions of their LTE customers. As with the upgrades 
from 2G wireless to 3G wireless, one of the most important factors is how fast these net-
works are built and how many customers each can attract. It is possible that the network 
that operates first and fastest, and at the most affordable price, will be the one that attracts 
the most customers and—for this reason—will become the prevailing choice for 4G. 
For individual consumers, it might be wise to delay upgrading their current devices 
or network service contracts with their cellular carriers for as long as possible so they can 
choose the service and device that will work the best for them in terms of cost and in the 
geographic coverage areas in which they require service. Businesses should follow a similar 
strategy to ensure that the network and devices will address the needs of their users at an 
affordable cost. By delaying these decisions, individuals and businesses might be able to 
wait until one network standard becomes the more dominant one, and avoid purchasing 
devices or service contracts on a smaller or less capable network.
Because all of the vets use wireless devices, you need to know more about the types 
of tasks that the devices must handle. Ruby tells you her staff is interested in using smart-
phones for all of their current needs, which includes voice calls, text messaging, Web 
browsing, sending and receiving large files via email, and taking and sending pictures 
and video. Because the vets want to download Web pages and transfer large picture 
and video files taken with their devices, you will need to find an option that has a fast 
transfer rate and devices that have these desired features. Finally, because the vets travel 
frequently, the devices they use and the service provider will need to offer connectivity 
options for the largest possible coverage area without incurring additional costs.
Using Wireless Devices to Access the Internet
Because the vets will rely heavily on their devices, your first priority is to explore device 
options that use 4G networks to provide Internet connections through a WWAN. Most 
cellular phone carriers make it easy to select a device that works on a network, and 
provide other resources such as charts to compare and contrast the different features of 
the wireless device. Most carriers offer specific products, such as the Droid smartphone, 
wireless USB modem, and MiFi device shown in Figure 7-12, to work on their wireless 
networks.

Because the staff indicated a preference for using their devices in places where 
Wi-Fi is likely to be in use, you also decide to research Wi-Fi service providers in the 
United States. Many businesses provide free Wi-Fi services, but these Wi-Fi hotspots 
are frequently not secure, making them less desirable for business communications. 
Subscribing to a Wi-Fi service will require a payment for use, but will provide a more 
reliable and secure connection. Figure 7-13 shows the home page for Boingo, which 
provides subscription-based Wi-Fi service for its customers in more than 325,000 loca-
tions around the world.
Some networks, such as those found in airports and hotels, let you pay a daily 
fee to use the network. Other networks require a monthly fee for using the network. 
Fortunately, there are many plans that would work well for Mobile Vet Services to pro-
vide Wi-Fi service that is reliable and secure.

Security Concerns for Using Wireless Networks 
In Session 7.1, you learned about different kinds of wireless networks and the devices 
you can use to connect to them. The kind of connection you make depends on the type 
of device you have: A device that was manufactured for a certain cellular network won’t 
necessarily work on another cellular network. The type of connection you make also 
depends on the network that you are connecting to. Being able to pick up a wireless sig-
nal doesn’t mean that you can automatically use it to connect to the Internet—nor does 
it always mean that you should connect to a wireless signal that you pick up.
Just like in the wired world of networking, ensuring the security of the data sent over 
a wireless network presents many challenges. Some of the security challenges are the 
same between wired and wireless networks; but many of the challenges in protecting 
a wireless network are complicated by the fact that a wireless network sends its data 
through the air using radio signals that are subject to interception. Although there are 
different kinds of threats to wireless networks—and new threats as hackers get better at 
figuring out how to manipulate the technology and its signals—there are also security 
threats to individual wireless devices, the most basic of which is theft of the device itself. 
The Session 7.2 Visual Overview identifies some of the major concerns for wireless con-
nections and wireless devices.
As Ruby considers wireless options for the Mobile Vet Services staff, she needs to 
understand the various security measures for wireless networks, the threats to the wire-
less devices, and methods for securing the wireless devices her staff will use to connect 
and send data using wireless networks.
Methods for Securing Wireless Networks
When setting up a wireless network for a home or small business, you can use one or 
more techniques to secure the network from different types of attacks and other threats. 
To protect the data that is transmitted over the wireless network, you can enable specific 
encryption methods. You also need to protect the network from unauthorized access by 
limiting the devices that can connect to it. You can set the router and individual devices 
that connect to the router to protect against unauthorized access.
Wireless Encryption Methods
As you learned in Tutorial 6, encryption is the process of coding information so that it 
is not readable by devices or people who do not have the secret key used to return the 
information back to its original, readable state. By default, most wireless networks are 
unsecured, meaning that any compatible wireless device within range of the network 
can connect to it. Unfortunately, many home and small business networks are never 
secured and therefore are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. There are many wireless 
encryption methods that provide different levels of protection for wireless networks.
Wired Equivalent Privacy
One of the first methods used to secure wireless networks, Wired Equivalent Privacy 
(WEP), is a security protocol for wireless LANs (using Wi-Fi) that works by encrypt-
ing data sent over the network. When WEP is enabled, it encrypts the data sent over 
the network with a 64-bit or 128-bit key, sometimes also called a passphrase, that is 
entered by the user. These settings—64-bit key and 128-bit key—are standards used 
in the electronic commerce industry to represent the security level of the key. The key 
works because both the wireless router or access point and the device connecting to 
the wireless network have the same key and use it to encrypt and decrypt messages. The 
encryption slows down the network somewhat because of the time it takes to encrypt 
and decrypt the messages. The level of encryption provided by the key depends on

the key’s length; a 128-bit key is more secure than a 64-bit key because it is longer and 
contains more characters. A 64-bit key contains 10 hexadecimal characters (the digits 0 
through 9 and the letters A though F); a 128-bit key contains 26 hexadecimal characters. 
Figure 7-14 shows examples of randomly generated 64-bit and 128-bit keys, and a  
custom 128-bit key based on a user-entered passphrase.
Depending on the equipment used and how much time and money a hacker has, it 
can take time to decipher an intercepted message encrypted with a 64-bit key, and even 
longer to decipher an intercepted message encrypted with a 128-bit key. Deciphering a 
key isn’t easy, and it requires a substantial amount of computing power and time. But, for 
a person who has these resources, it is possible to decipher a WEP-encrypted message. 
For this reason, and because of the actual way that data is encrypted, many comput-
ing experts don’t recommend WEP because it provides insufficient security for wireless 
networks.
Another vulnerability of WEP encryption is the fact that the key used to encrypt the 
data you are sending is sent over the network before the actual data is encrypted, and 
this same key is used to encrypt every data packet. This means that you send the key 
over the network with no protection before the data you are sending is encrypted. (If 
you change the key frequently, you’ll provide some additional security to the network.) 
Although this is a simplified explanation of the problem, it does support the consensus of 
most experts that using WEP is better than nothing, but it is not ideal for securing a wire-
less network.
Wi-Fi Protected Access
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), another wireless network security protocol, is a standard 
that was developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance to address some of the inherent weaknesses 
in WEP. WPA provides better encryption than WEP because WPA uses a preshared key 
to encrypt data (so the key isn’t broadcast before data is encrypted), and individual data 
packets are encrypted with different keys. This means that a hacker might be able to 
intercept a data packet, but he won’t gain access to the entire message automatically, 
making the content of the complete message difficult to read. Like WEP, WPA can use a 
128-bit key to encrypt data.
Although WPA provides good protection, one drawback is that all devices in the 
network need to use WPA. Some older devices will still need to use WEP or another 
protocol to secure data. Some wireless routers and access points let you use a combi-
nation of WEP and WPA when your network makes connections to devices that can’t 
manage WPA.

Decision Making: Deciding Which Encryption Method to Use for Wireless 
Networks
In business settings and in large organizations, networks might carry highly sensitive infor-
mation such as a person’s credit card number or medical history. These businesses must 
use advanced methods for securing data transmitted over a wireless network.
For home and small business users, however, the choice of which method to use to 
secure a wireless network is up to the individual user. Unfortunately, many wireless routers 
are packaged with no security settings enabled on them. This means that users who con-
nect the router and plug it into their DSL or cable modem and then immediately start using 
the signal that the router transmits are doing so with no encryption or enabled security 
settings. People in the next room or across the street can also detect your wireless net-
work and use it. They might not do anything to the signal that has negative consequences 
to you; but at a minimum, they might borrow your Internet connection and use its signal, 
which slows down the connection speed when you use the network.
It’s worth taking the time to read and understand the documentation for a wireless 
router to make good decisions about how to secure it. You might need to install some 
software on your computer to access the router so you can change its configurations. If the 
router and your computer support WPA, you should use this encryption instead of WEP 
because it is more secure. However, if your computer won’t support WPA, using WEP usu-
ally provides sufficient protection to keep users from accessing your network’s signal.
In addition to adding data encryption to a wireless network, you can use other tech-
niques to secure the network by limiting the devices that can connect to it.
MAC Address Filtering
Every Internet device has a network interface card that it uses to connect to a network. 
Each manufacturer of network interface cards adds a unique number, called a Media 
Access Control address (or more commonly called a MAC address) to identify the 
device. Another way to protect a wireless network is to designate the devices that you 
want to allow to connect to the network. Most routers and access points include software 
that lets you identify the allowable devices using their MAC addresses. If you enable 
MAC address filtering for a wireless router or access point, then it will only accept 
connections from the devices with the MAC addresses that you entered. Other wireless 
devices still might detect your wireless network, but they won’t be able to connect to it 
because their MAC addresses are not specified for access. MAC address filtering adds 
another layer of security to a wireless network because it doesn’t allow unknown devices 
to make connections.
The MAC address for detachable network interface cards, such as ones that you insert 
into a notebook computer’s PC card slot or USB devices, is usually printed on the card 
or USB device. A MAC address appears in the format 00:00:00:0A:0B:0C, as a combina-
tion of digits and letters. When a device contains an internal network interface card, you 
can see its MAC address by using the Windows Device Manager or the device’s settings 
menu to view the properties for the network interface card.
Every network interface card 
has a MAC address; this 
term refers to the Media 
Access Control (MAC) 
address on the device, not 
to the Macintosh (Mac) 
computer.

Disabling the SSID Broadcast
When a wireless router or access point sends out its signal, it also broadcasts its service 
set identifier (SSID) as a way of identifying the network’s name. This feature makes it 
possible for roaming devices to discover the network and also enables you to log in to 
the correct network. Most manufacturers of wireless routers and access points use the 
manufacturer name or the word “default” as the default SSID for the device. When you 
install a wireless router or access point, you can accept this default name or change it to 
a name that has up to 32 alphanumeric characters. Most manufacturers strongly recom-
mend that you change the default name as part of its initial configuration. All devices 
that connect to the wireless network must use the SSID.
INSIGHT
Disabling the SSID in Home Networks
For public wireless networks, sending out the SSID is necessary because it provides 
information that a wireless device needs in order to connect to the wireless network. 
However, for home networks, sending out the SSID is not necessary, especially if you 
already use MAC address filtering to identify the devices that you want to connect to 
the wireless network. In other words, after you configure your own devices to connect 
to your wireless network, you don’t need to broadcast the SSID any longer because you 
won’t need to roam and find the network—you already know the network’s name and its 
settings, and your wireless devices also know them once they are configured. Disabling 
the SSID broadcast of a home network makes the network invisible to roaming devices 
and therefore makes it more difficult for other devices to detect its signal.
If you change the default name of the wireless router or access point, you also prevent 
unknown users from detecting your network by attempting to randomly connect to a wire-
less network using a manufacturer name or the word “default” as an SSID. Wardriving—
driving through a neighborhood with a wireless device with the goal of locating houses 
and businesses that have wireless networks in order to gain access to them—is a com-
mon way for hackers to access unsecured networks. Finding a wireless network that uses 
“default” or a manufacturer name as its SSID is a good clue to hackers that the wireless 
network’s owner didn’t take precautions to secure the wireless network. Used alone and 
especially with other security precautions, disabling the SSID adds another layer of pro-
tection to the network to prevent unknown devices from connecting to it.
You can change the SSID name for your wireless router or access point and disable its 
signal by logging into the router or access point and changing these settings in the device 
configuration.
Changing the Default Login
When you install a wireless router or access point for the first time, the device is config-
ured with a default user name and password that is printed in the device’s user manual. 
The default login is provided so you can use your computer to access the device’s settings 
and configure it to work as desired. One of the most serious mistakes that home users 
make when installing a wireless network is failing to change the default login for the 
device. By making this mistake, you make it possible for anyone who already knows the 
manufacturer’s generic default login information to access the wireless network. If you 
haven’t implemented any other security for the router, such as changing the default SSID 
or disabling its broadcast, your wireless network is visible and easy to access using the 
default login. When you install a wireless network, make it a priority to change the default 
login and password. Be sure to keep your login in a safe place; after you change it, you 
won’t be able to access the device’s configuration page again using the default login.
SSIDs are case-sensitive, 
so be sure to note the 
case of the name that you 
assign and use the same 
case when configuring the 
devices to connect to it.
Piggybacking is a term 
used to describe a person 
who gains access to and 
uses a wireless network, 
sometimes by wardriving.

Ruby realizes that she can purchase a wireless router or access point and start using 
it right away, but she now understands why it is a good idea to spend some time to learn 
how to configure it properly. She can use the checklist shown in Figure 7-15 to make it 
easier for her to configure the wireless network in the office.
Of course, the safest wireless network is one that is turned off. Most experts recom-
mend disconnecting or powering off your wireless network when you won’t be using it 
for an extended period of time, such as when you leave on vacation.
The methods for securing wireless networks that you have examined so far mostly 
apply to smaller networks, such as networks for home or small business use, where a 
small number of devices need to connect to the network. Organizations with many wire-
less connections from many different devices require an additional resource to protect 
the networks from the same types of threats common to home and small business users. 
You’ll learn about using software to protect wireless networks next.
Using Software to Protect Wireless Networks
Larger wireless networks with many different devices connecting to them can supply an 
additional layer of security by running software that prevents unauthorized network use, 
protects against different kinds of security threats, and monitors the network for other 
types of problems that might affect the network’s reliability and performance. Because 
the Mobile Vet Services office might install a wireless network and will need to ensure 
the security of the data transmitted over the network, you’ll examine some of these 
programs next.

Change the default login and password for the wireless router or access point.
Change the default SSID. Be sure to type the name in the desired case, as the SSID is 
case sensitive.
Obtain the MAC addresses of the wireless devices that will connect to the wireless 
network, and then enter their MAC addresses using the conﬁguration for the wireless 
router or device.
Enable MAC address ﬁltering on the wireless router or access point.
Enable the highest level of security that your wireless devices and wireless router or 
access point can manage. Be sure to use the most secure key the wireless router or access 
point offers. If you must use WEP, change the passphrase occasionally.
Make sure that all of your wireless devices can connect to the wireless network with the 
settings you’ve implemented.
Disable the SSID for your wireless router or access point.
When not using the wireless network for an extended period of time, such as when 
leaving on vacation, power it off.

Understanding Security Threats to Wireless 
Devices
Because wireless technology makes it possible to work in almost any place with a wire-
less network connection, many people enjoy the freedom of having a mobile office or 
the convenience of being able to do work outside of the conventional office or home 
office environment. As you learned in Session 7.1, many businesses offer free Wi-Fi ser-
vice as a way of attracting and retaining customers. Some customers are irritated when 
a business offers Wi-Fi service but requires a fee to make connections because so many 
businesses offer the same service at no charge. Customers expect Wi-Fi service at certain 
kinds of businesses and in certain areas, such as airport terminals and restaurants, where 
customers spend time waiting. Fortunately, the technology to install a wireless network is 
affordable and easy to implement, and many businesses attract and retain customers by 
installing wireless networks.
Wireless devices of all kinds are subject to many types of attacks, especially when 
they are used in public places. An over-the-shoulder attack occurs when an unauthor-
ized person uses his or her physical proximity to your device to attempt to see your 
login information, passwords, or other sensitive data while you are working. People who 
use wireless devices in public places might not question why another person is stand-
ing behind them; they might incorrectly assume this person is simply standing in line or 
waiting for a friend. When working in public places, it’s important to be aware of where 
other people are located in proximity to you and your device, especially if you are using 
your wireless device to transmit data that you wouldn’t want another person to see. For 
this reason, most security experts advise against activities such as online banking, check-
ing email, and online shopping in public places. Not only are these activities visible to 
over-the-shoulder attacks, they are also subject to being intercepted.
In an evil twin attack, also sometimes called a café latte attack because the attack 
often occurs at coffeehouses, a hacker gathers information about an access point and 
then uses that information to set up his own computer to use the real access point’s 
signal to impersonate the access point. To other customers, the hacker looks like a cus-
tomer who is also using the network. As customers use their devices to detect and con-
nect to the network, they are unaware that they are actually connecting to the hacker’s 
computer. 
When people use one of the many free public hotspots for wireless Internet connec-
tions, the data they send over the network usually is not encrypted or secure. This data 
is subject to hackers using sniffer programs to illegally monitor activity on the wireless 
network in order to obtain personal information that users might transmit, such as a login 
or a credit card number. The hacker uses these connections and a sniffer program to 
read and store the data that the customers send to his system. When customers engage 
in online banking or online shopping, or log on to Web sites that require passwords, the 
hacker happily collects this sensitive data. Depending on what data the hacker collects, 
he might later use the customer’s credit card numbers to make online purchases or use 
login information to access the victim’s email account. All of this happens without the 
customer’s or the network owner’s knowledge.
A third type of attack, called a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM attack), occurs when 
transmissions, such as messages between users, logins, and normal connections with 
Web servers, that are being sent between two devices are intercepted by a third party. 
For example, suppose device A is sending a transmission to device B over a wireless 
network. In a man-in-the-middle attack, a third party—the intruder—uses device C to 
intercept the transmission. In this case, device C might eavesdrop on the transmission to 
gain information or alter the transmission in some way. In either case, devices A and B 
are unaware of the intrusion. Preventing MITM attacks requires users to ensure that their 
transmissions are encrypted, that they are communicating with known parties and cli-
ents, and that they are aware of anything suspicious in the connection that might make 
them suspect an intruder.

Using Public Hotspots Safely
To protect your wireless device from different types of attacks, you can refrain from 
using it in any public place; but there might be times when you are traveling or working 
outside of your home or office when you need to connect to the Internet. You can take 
several precautions to protect your wireless device.
First, avoid online banking, online shopping, and visiting Web sites that require you 
to enter a login or personal information. In other words, don’t work in public places if 
you need to interact with something of value.
What if you must use email or another service that requires a login? Instead of 
connecting to any free hotspot that your device picks up, establish a connection to a 
network that provides some kind of login from the access point’s owner. Although you 
might prefer to get your Wi-Fi service for free, your connection is more secure when the 
hotspot requires an account with an established service provider. You might need to pay 
for your use of the service, but you’re more likely to connect to a wireless network that 
provides some sort of encryption and security.
Finally, when working in a business facility, such as a convention center, sports arena, 
or other large building that provides Internet access, or when working in a hotel, opt for 
a wired Ethernet connection whenever possible. Although your devices are still subject 
to some basic security threats, connecting to the Internet with a wired connection elimi-
nates the wireless threats to your device.
Just like a personal computer, a wireless device is vulnerable to certain kinds of 
attacks on the data it stores. Unlike a personal computer, the kinds of attacks are differ-
ent and they might vary for individual devices. For example, Bluetooth-enabled devices 
are vulnerable to certain kinds of attacks that do not target non-Bluetooth devices. You’ll 
explore these security issues next.
Security Concerns for Bluetooth-Enabled Devices
Most smartphones and many other devices are enabled with Bluetooth, which lets the 
user pair devices such as a headset with a smartphone for hands-free use. As you learned 
in Session 7.1, the usual range for a Bluetooth-enabled device is 10 to 30 feet, and up to 
300 feet, depending on the device. This short range and the fact that it is possible to pair 
Bluetooth-enabled devices without a password make it possible for someone to access 
your device without your consent or knowledge. Although many smartphone manufac-
turers have updated their software to prevent some of these types of attacks, having a 
basic understanding of these security concerns lets you secure your device to prevent 
these and other types of threats. The most common security problems of Bluetooth 
devices are bluejacking, bluesnarfing, and bluebugging. 
Bluejacking is a term coined from the words “blue” and “ajack.” (Ajack is the user 
name of a person in an Internet forum who claims to have been the first person to blue-
jack someone else.) The bluejacker sends an anonymous message in the form of a phone 
contact displayed as a text message to a Bluetooth-enabled device to surprise the owner, 
express an opinion, or make a social connection. In the first documented bluejacking, 
Ajack sent a message to the owner of a Nokia phone that said “Buy Ericsson!” to express 
his preference for Sony Ericsson phones.
Bluejacking, although alarming to some people, is mostly harmless because the 
victim’s device is not breached; it is only sent a message. The message is usually sent by 
a bluejacker who takes advantage of the victim’s unprotected device or is interested in 
the victim. Bluejacking is temporary: When the bluejacker’s device or your device moves 
out of range, the messages will stop. Because bluejacking uses a feature of the device 
designed for legitimate purposes, it does not require special software or equipment. 
Some sources state that 
the word “bluejacking” 
is coined from the terms 
“blue” and “hijacking.” 
During a bluejack, the 
device is not actually 
hijacked, so this combina-
tion of terms is misleading.

Internet | Tutorial 7 Wireless Networking
A more serious security problem of Bluetooth-enabled devices, bluesnarfing, occurs 
when a hacker with special software can detect the signal from a Bluetooth-enabled 
device and gain access to its data without the owner’s knowledge. The hacker can access 
data stored on the device, such as the contact list, connect to the Internet, listen in on 
phone calls, and send email messages from the victim’s device. Some hackers wait in 
crowded areas such as shopping malls and set their device to detect Bluetooth-enabled 
devices. If the hacker can make a connection to a vulnerable device, he’ll use it for as 
long as it is in range to access data on the device. Since discovering this vulnerability, 
many manufacturers of Bluetooth-enabled devices have released software updates to 
prevent the problem—but many owners did not install them. Newer Bluetooth-enabled 
devices are not subject to bluesnarfing attacks because this vulnerability has been fixed.
The most serious security threat to Bluetooth-enabled devices is bluebugging, which 
occurs when a hacker gains access to the device and its functions without the owner’s 
consent. A bluebugging attack lets the hacker use the device to make phone calls, access 
data, and use the Internet while the device is in range. Most manufacturers of Bluetooth 
devices have released updates to fix the security flaw that makes bluebugging possible. 
Newer Bluetooth-enabled devices are less vulnerable to these attacks.
The two most serious Bluetooth attacks, bluesnarfing and bluebugging, can only occur 
within the range of the Bluetooth-enabled device and on older devices on which users 
did not install the software updates necessary to correct these problems. To protect a 
Bluetooth-enabled device from bluejacking, bluesnarfing, or bluebugging, you can dis-
able the device’s Bluetooth feature so that its signal is invisible to other users (also called 
undiscoverable mode). Disabling the device’s Bluetooth feature prevents other users 
from being able to detect the device, which eliminates many types of security issues. A 
good precaution for users of Bluetooth-enabled devices is to make sure their devices use 
the latest software and to turn the Bluetooth feature off when working in crowded areas. 
Security Risks with Smartphone Applications
One reason many people enjoy having a smartphone is that it has an operating system 
that can run programs, also called applications or, more commonly, apps. As shown 
in Figure 7-17, an app is installed as a program icon that when activated might dis-
play current weather conditions, open a contacts list, start a calculator, download your 
email, or play music stored on the device or streamed to the device from an Internet 
site. The predominant operating systems for smartphones are Apple iOS (which runs 
on the Apple iPhone and also on the Apple iPod Touch and iPad), Windows Mobile, 
BlackBerry OS, and Google Android. Each operating system runs on many different types 
of smartphones.

Tutorial 7 Wireless Networking | Internet
You download apps for a particular device and operating system by connecting to 
the online store that sells them, such as the Apple App Store, Windows Marketplace, 
BlackBerry App World, or Android Market. In these stores, apps are organized by cat-
egories such as personal fitness, games, travel, and utilities. In each of these stores, users 
can download apps for their specific device that are developed by companies or amateur 
programmers for free or for a fee. 
Before an app is made available for download at one of these stores, the app’s devel-
oper usually must agree to follow the rules stated in the site’s acceptable use policy and 
other requirements before the app is accepted for distribution. For example, the Apple 
App Store, which includes more than 425,000 downloadable apps for Apple devices, 
has strict requirements for submitting apps and only distributes an app when the iden-
tity of the app’s developer can be proven and the app itself does not violate any coding 
restrictions of the store. As you might expect, not all apps are accepted for distribution.
In some limited cases, an app might contain malware or other security threats that 
seek to gain access to the user’s device, or perform other tasks that might somehow 
compromise the security of the device or the information it stores. In one documented 
case, an app was suspended from a store when it was identified as sending the contacts 
list and other data from the user’s device to the developer’s server. In other cases, fake 
apps were released to look like a well-known popular app, but they instead contained 
malware that provided access to the user’s device. In this instance, users thought they 
downloaded a popular (and safe) app, but instead downloaded an app that contained 
malware that compromised their devices.
Smartphone users should be especially careful when installing apps that require login 
information, such as an app that makes a connection to the user’s bank account. You 
should verify the app’s origin by confirming that your bank does offer an app and follow 
the instructions on the bank’s Web site to locate and install it. After installing the app, do 
not set it to save your user name or password on the device in case the device is stolen 
or lost.

Finally, be cautious about what you install by confirming the source of the down-
load. In general, you can assume a certain level of protection by installing only those 
apps available through the app store for your device. Some people unlock the operat-
ing systems on their devices in order to disable the device so it can run apps from other 
providers. This practice, called jailbreaking when done on an Apple device or rooting 
when done on an Android device, is legal, but not recommended. If you jailbreak or 
root a device, you will most likely invalidate your device’s warranty. In addition, you 
might disable some of the security features on the device itself, making the device more 
vulnerable to different types of problems. Although many people feel that jailbreaking or 
rooting a device makes it more usable, doing so might compromise the security features 
provided by the device’s operating system.
When looking at ways to secure a wireless device, there are some basic precautions 
that each user must take to secure the actual device and also to secure the connections 
the device makes.
Methods for Securing Wireless Devices
Almost every wireless device, including smartphones and gaming consoles, has been 
subject to data breaches in the form of hacking, operating system flaws, or malware. A 
good way to protect a device is to make sure that the operating system installed on it is 
always current. Just like for desktop applications, such as the Windows operating system, 
as new problems are identified, new software updates are pushed to devices to correct 
these known issues. If you sync your device frequently and set it to download software 
updates, you can ensure a certain level of protection from known problems. In addition, 
syncing your device creates a copy of the data it stores on your computer. In the event of 
a serious device malfunction, theft, or loss, you will be able to use the backup copy of 
your device to reinstall its data and settings.
Most devices include a usage setting that allows you to track their network activity. If 
you subscribe to a network plan that limits the amount of data transferred each month, 
you might use this feature to make sure that you do not exceed your maximum data 
usage limits. Another reason to check the usage statistics for your device is to look for 
unauthorized usage. For example, if your device shows several megabytes of data being 
sent over the network at a time when you were not using it, this information might lead 
you to suspect that a rogue program has been installed on the device and is using the 
network connection to send data to a third party. If you suspect this type of activity, turn 
off your device and take it to your network carrier immediately for further inspection.
Be sure to lock your device with a password and set the device to lock immediately or 
within a minute or two after its use. Locking the device will protect the data on it in the 
event of loss or theft. Some devices include features or let you install apps that determine 
the exact location of your device if it is lost or stolen. Some people install apps or enable 
an additional level of protection on the device to allow them to delete everything on 
the device when they are certain that they will not recover it. In these cases, if you have 
been diligently syncing and backing up your device, your data loss should be minimal.
Another precaution that protects a wireless device is to disable the feature that lets the 
device automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks when it is within range of the network. 
This feature is sometimes called autoconnect, and is similar to the discoverable mode 
for Bluetooth-enabled devices. When you set your device to prompt you to connect to 
an in-range network, you prevent an unknown network from connecting to the device 
without your permission. Keep in mind that free Wi-Fi networks are usually unencrypted, 
so you should prevent your device from automatically connecting to networks, espe-
cially when the data sent over those networks might be vulnerable to interception by an 
unknown party. 
The action of issuing a 
command to delete every-
thing stored on a wireless 
device is sometimes called 
a remote wipe. The 
device must be connected 
to the network to receive 
the command.

A good practice is to avoid storing login information and passwords used for the apps 
and other features on your device. For example, if you have a banking app on your 
device, you’ll prevent unauthorized use of your account in the event that you lose your 
device. If you store your passwords on your device, then anyone who has your device 
also has access to your bank account, email, or other private information. As shown in 
Figure 7-18, when you log in to a Web site using a wireless device, you should deselect 
the option that instructs the device to remember your password—so you must enter the 
password each time you log in. By entering the password each time, you’ll avoid prob-
lems with an unauthorized user gaining access to your login information if the device 
retains the password for future use.
In addition, you should manage the passwords you use on the device carefully and 
avoid using the same password for multiple sites. If you know which passwords you have 
used on the device, you’ll be able to change them easily if you need to. If you use differ-
ent passwords for your various logins, you ensure that your logins are protected in case 
one account becomes vulnerable.

INSIGHT
New Technologies Bring Heightened Risks
Every day, people around the world use the features and apps on their mobile broad-
band devices to perform all kinds of tasks, including getting step-by-step directions to 
a specific location; making and receiving phone calls; taking pictures and videos and 
sending them to other people via SMS, email, or a social networking site; sending and 
receiving email messages; updating their social networking pages; and browsing the 
Internet. As wireless networks continue to increase in size, and the download speeds for 
mobile broadband devices continue to get faster, mobile Internet users will continue to 
benefit from the incredible functionality these devices provide.
As these devices become more sophisticated by including new technologies that 
add functionality, the devices and their owners become more vulnerable to new security 
and privacy threats that exploit the conveniences these new technologies provide. For 
example, some of the latest technologies allow you to use your device to conduct finan-
cial transactions at retail locations that link your device to your financial accounts, such as 
a credit card or banking account. In this case, losing your device might make your finan-
cial accounts more vulnerable to theft. Many devices include GPS tracking, which users 
rely on to plan business trips or vacation travel, make hotel reservations, reserve rental 
cars, and map travel routes. The GPS tracking provides a level of convenience to the user, 
but this feature also makes it possible for someone to track your location with the intent of 
threatening you or your property. New technology in the medical and health industry uses 
Bluetooth-enabled devices to track, manage, and transmit sensitive medical data from 
a patient with a chronic medical condition directly to his or her physician, which has the 
potential to put confidential medical data at risk of interception or interruption. 
These new technologies require users to be even more vigilant to protect their per-
sonal information, their property, and themselves. As more people use mobile devices 
for routine transactions, they become more vulnerable to the additional risks involved in 
conducting these transactions. By following the security precautions outlined in this ses-
sion, they will have a safer and more secure mobile broadband experience.
Ruby is satisfied that she can implement appropriate security precautions on any 
wireless networks that she installs and uses, and can provide a list of precautions the 
vets can take to protect their wireless devices and the confidential business and personal 
data that these devices will store. She will also make sure that Mobile Vet Services staff 
members who use public hotspots are aware of the precautions you outlined to protect 
their devices.

Case Problem 1
There are no Data Files needed for this Case Problem.
Evaluating Competing 4G Wireless Technologies  Emma Curtis—a lawyer who spends a 
great deal of her time in the courthouse, and traveling to depose witnesses and meet with 
clients—tells you that she is interested in signing up for mobile broadband service and 
purchasing a new smartphone to help her conduct business while she is away from her 
downtown Chicago office. She downloads a lot of data every day, so she is interested in 
getting the fastest, most reliable, and most cost-effective connection available in her area. 
You’ll help her evaluate the current or proposed 4G network service in Chicago, Illinois, 
by completing the following steps:
 1. Start your Web browser, go to www.cengagebrain.com, open the Tutorial 7 Weblinks 
page, and then click the Case Problem 1 link. Choose one of the Web sites provided 
in the LTE section and click it to open the site’s home page.
 2. Review the page and find a link or feature that lets you search for the coverage area 
of the 4G network. Use the city, state, and zip code Chicago, IL 60601 to deter-
mine whether the provider has 4G network coverage in this location. If it does not, 
return to the Weblinks page for Tutorial 7 and use another link in the LTE section 
to determine if another carrier provides 4G service for downtown Chicago. If you 
cannot find 4G (LTE) service for this location, try to determine if this location might 
be included in the network’s planned coverage for the future. (Note: If the pro-
vider requires a specific street address to determine network coverage, try another 
provider.)
 3. If you find a carrier that provides 4G (LTE) service for downtown Chicago, evalu-
ate the service by reviewing the page to determine the cost of the service, its data 
transfer limits, the types of devices the network supports, available roaming options 
for the device when it is out of the 4G network’s range, network security features, 
and other details that will help you understand the service. Pay particular attention 
to details that will help you make an informed decision about choosing a service 
provider. If you cannot find a carrier that provides 4G (LTE) service for downtown 
Chicago, use the general information on one of the sites to answer the questions in 
this step.
 4. Return to the Tutorial 7 Weblinks page, and then click a link in the WiMAX section. 
Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to determine if any of the carriers provide 4G (WiMAX) service 
for downtown Chicago. If you cannot find any 4G WiMAX providers for this location, 
use the general information on one of the sites to answer the questions in Step 3. 
 5. In a report addressed to Emma, describe your findings for 4G LTE and WiMAX by 
answering the following questions:
a. Does one 4G technology seem to have a larger network coverage area than 
another?

page, and then click the Case Problem 2 link.
 2. Click a link to one of the sites provided, and then explore the site to learn more 
about how Bluetooth is used to enhance medical reporting. Pay particular atten-
tion to medical devices used in the treatment and monitoring of diabetes, such as 
glucose monitors, and the ways patients can use Bluetooth to facilitate communica-
tion of their test results with their physicians. Also evaluate other types of devices 
that would benefit a physician, such as heart monitors and stethoscopes. As you are 
evaluating these other types of devices, think about how Bluetooth enhances the 
communication, security, and storage of data.
 3. Return to the Tutorial 7 Weblinks page, and then choose a link to another site. Use 
the information provided in Step 2 to evaluate the Bluetooth options at the sec-
ond site. If you feel that you need more information, use the other links for Case

Case Problem 4
There are no Data Files needed for this Case Problem.
Security and Privacy Issues of Location-Based Services  You just purchased a smart-
phone and have used it to map a road trip, reserve a room at a hotel along your route, 
and find the least expensive gasoline as you traveled. All of these activities have relied 
on the GPS coordinates of your phone to identify your location so that the information 
you requested could be processed and customized for your exact location. Although this 
information has greatly enhanced your trip, you are worried about how this information 
could be used in ways that might threaten your personal security or the security of your 
belongings. You decide to research some of the issues involved in location-based services 
so you can make safe decisions about using this feature. Complete the following steps:
 1. Start your Web browser, go to www.cengagebrain.com, open the Tutorial 7 Weblinks 
page, and then click the Case Problem 4 link.
 2. Click one of the links in the Case Problem 4 section, and then use the search box on 
the site or browse the site to search for key terms such as geotracking (or geo track-
ing), location privacy, location-based services, and geotagging. Explore the resources 
that you find. As you conduct your research, answer the following questions:
a. What is geotracking? What are some uses of geotracking?
b. What is geotagging? What are some uses of geotagging?
c. What is a location-based service? How does it work? What are some examples 
of location-based services that might be used by emergency responders or law 
enforcement agencies? What are some examples of location-based services that 
might be used for unlawful activities? What are some examples of location-based 
services that might be used to enhance consumers’ experiences or for product 
marketing?
 3. Return to the Tutorial 7 Weblinks page, and then explore another site using the same 
types of key terms you used at the site you visited in Step 2. If necessary, update your 
responses to the questions in Step 2 using any new information you find. 
 4. Conclude your report by answering the following questions and supporting your 
conclusions with information you found while conducting your research:
a. From a privacy standpoint, what are some of the advantages and disadvantages of 
using location-based services?
b. Do you feel that governmental agencies—such as the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), along with Congress 
and state legislatures—should enact legislation regarding location-based ser-
vices, or do you feel that the consumer should have control over their use? Why 
or why not?
c. If you own a device that uses location-based services to track your movements, 
will the research you conducted affect your decision to continue or stop using 
these services? Why or why not?
 5. Close your browser.

Evaluating Mobile Banking Options  Kerrigan McGibbs, a college freshman, is living 
away from home for the first time while attending school in another state. Just like other 
college students, she relies on her hometown bank to manage her finances. Her bank 
just sent her an email message explaining three new services it provides to its customers: 
a mobile banking app for smartphones, a mobile banking site, and text banking. Kerrigan 
is curious about these services and decides to investigate them to determine the level of 
security each option provides to users. Complete the following steps:
 1. Start your Web browser, go to www.cengagebrain.com, open the Tutorial 7 Weblinks 
page, and then click the Case Problem 5 link.
 2. Use the links in the Mobile Banking Apps section to answer the following questions 
about mobile banking apps in a report addressed to your instructor:
a. What features does the mobile banking app provide to customers?
b. On which kinds of devices does the mobile banking app work?
c. What kind of security does the mobile banking app provide? Does the bank offer 
any additional services to ensure secure transactions, such as additional software 
or login verification? Does the bank guarantee the security of users’ transactions? 
If so, what guarantees does the bank offer?
d. What types of transactions can users complete?
 3. Return to the Tutorial 7 Weblinks page, and then use the links in the Mobile Banking 
Sites section to answer the following questions:
a. What types of transactions can users complete?
b. What kind of security does the mobile Web banking site provide? Does the bank 
offer any additional services to ensure secure transactions, such as additional soft-
ware or login verification? Does the bank guarantee the security of users’ transac-
tions? If so, what guarantees does the bank offer?
 4. Return to the Tutorial 7 Weblinks page, and then use the links in the Text Banking 
section to answer the following questions:
a. What is text banking?
b. What types of transactions can users complete using text banking?
c. What kind of security is provided when users perform transactions using text 
banking? Does the bank guarantee the security of those transactions? If so, what 
guarantees does the bank offer?
d. What costs might the customer incur when completing text banking transactions?
 5. Conclude your report by using the information you found to describe how you 
would feel about conducting your banking transactions using a mobile banking app 
for a smartphone, a mobile banking site, and text banking. Do you feel that these 
methods of communication are sufficiently secure? Why or why not? What security 
risks exist when using a wireless device to utilize these banking services? How can 
you protect your data and your device from the other risks that you identify? Be

Case	|	Lakeside Police Department
The Lakeside Police Department employs 18 police officers, six 
full-time dispatchers, and 10 other full-time employees. The depart-
ment patrols Lakeside, Illinois, a small suburb outside of Chicago. 
Officers provide services not found in most major metropolitan 
areas, such as serving as school crossing guards, being mentors to 
children attending the local schools, and providing traffic control at 
city events.
The police chief, Mary Silva, believes that community education 
programs are an important part of providing effective police patrols 
and service. Chief Silva’s latest community education program is a 
series of self-defense classes. These classes are directed at specific 
groups, including children, elderly residents, women, and people 
with disabilities. Although the crime rate is low in Lakeside, many 
residents work in Chicago, where the crime rate is higher, and 
people in these groups are easier targets for assaults.
Chief Silva wants to create a Web site on which to post information 
about the police department. She needs your help to understand the 
issues involved in creating and maintaining a Web site. You will cre-
ate the pages that describe the self-defense program so Chief Silva 
can add them to the Web site. Chief Silva has asked you to cre-
ate the pages for the department and then to provide her with the 
options for creating a Web site so you can publish it on the Web.

Headings in a Web page are 
indicated by heading tags. The 
numbers 1 through 6 in the tag 
indicate the size of the text to 
display. For example, the <h1> 
and </h1> tags create a heading 
with the largest font size.
The text in the <a> and </a> 
tags creates a hyperlink. The 
href attribute identifies the 
link’s target.
The <html> tag 
indicates the 
beginning of an 
HTML document.
You can include content 
that you do not want to 
display in the Web page 
within the comment tag 
<!-- -->.
The text in the <title> and 
</title> tags, which are 
nested in the head section, 
identifies the title of the

Internet | Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages
Understanding Markup Languages
As you learned in Tutorial 1, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a nonproprietary 
markup language that a Web browser interprets and uses to display the content as a Web 
page. The Session 8.1 Visual Overview shows how HTML is used. A markup language is 
a general term that indicates the separation of the formatting of a document and the con-
tent of a document. Before HTML was created, Standard Generalized Markup Language 
(SGML)—a metalanguage that is used to create other languages—was the standard for 
formatting documents that were not dependent on the operating system or environment 
in which the documents were created or viewed. Because SGML is very complex, it is 
used almost exclusively by large organizations.
The first version of HTML was developed using SGML in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee 
and Robert Calliau while they were working at CERN—the European Laboratory for 
Particle Physics—on a project to improve the laboratory’s document-handling proce-
dures. Berners-Lee eventually transformed the initial work into the markup language that 
is now known as HTML. HTML quickly became the language used to create Web pages 
because of its simplicity and portability, which made it usable with many operating 
systems and on different types of computers. The creation of HTML resulted in the World 
Wide Web as we know it today.
HTML quickly evolved through specifications that are the result of the collective 
work of the organization known as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The W3C 
establishes specifications, or sets of standards, that identify how a browser interprets 
the HTML code. In turn, the individuals and companies that create browsers attempt 
to follow these specifications to ensure that the browsers interpret HTML correctly and 
consistently. The specifications are voluntary; but because the success of a Web site 
depends on the browser’s ability to follow the specifications, most organizations adhere 
to them as much as possible. The current specification is HTML 4.01, which is supported 
by major Web browsers. Since 2004, the W3C has been working on the fifth revision 
of the HTML specification, called HTML5, which is scheduled to be finalized in 2014. 
Most Web browsers support the draft version of HTML5 in anticipation of the standard 
being released. 
Another popular markup language is Extensible Markup Language (XML), which was 
a W3C recommendation that began in 1998 to describe the format and structure of data. 
XML is used to share data across organizations, especially when data is used on the 
Internet. Most programs, including Microsoft Office, include features that convert data 
stored in a proprietary format into XML. Although XML is a markup language, it differs 
from HTML in that XML uses a set of customizable tags to describe data and its relation-
ship to other tags. HTML uses standardized tags but does not allow this kind of flexibility 
when describing data.
The most recent markup language specification from the W3C integrates the format-
ting features of HTML with a stricter syntax that works to combine HTML and XML so 
that Web content is more readily and easily delivered to all devices that are connected to 
the Internet. This specification, recommended by the W3C in 2000, is called Extensible 
Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML). XHTML version 1.1 is compatible with the 
HTML 4.01 specification. The main differences between HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1 are 
in the syntax of the language. HTML is somewhat forgiving when it comes to including 
closing tags and supporting older features of earlier HTML specifications. XHTML is not 
as forgiving; therefore, many Web developers are using the stricter syntax of XHTML in 
HTML 4.01 documents so that any new applications that support only XHTML specifica-
tions will also be able to use the HTML documents. 
Figure 8-1 identifies some of the major syntax differences between HTML 4.01 and 
XHTML 1.1. As a beginning HTML student, it’s important to understand some of the dif-
ferences between the languages that you use to create Web pages as a basis for under-
standing them. You will learn more about HTML and XHTML syntax as you complete 
this session.
You can explore the links in 
the Additional Information 
section on the Tutorial 8 
Weblinks page to learn 
more about the existing 
HTML 4.01 and draft 
HTML5 specifications.

HTML
XHTML
No document type declaration is required. 
Requires a DOCTYPE declaration at the beginning 
of the file, such as:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-//W3C//DTD 
XHTML 1.0 transitional//EN” 
“http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtmll/DTD/ 
xhtmll-transitional.dtd”>
Tags can be written in uppercase or lowercase 
letters.
Tags must be written in lowercase letters only.
Attribute values do not need to be enclosed in 
quotation marks.
Attribute values must be enclosed in 
quotation marks.
Attributes can be minimized when the attribute 
name and value are identical, such as <option 
selected> to indicate the status of a selected 
item in a drop-down list box instead of <option 
selected="selected">.
Attribute minimization is prohibited.
Elements should be closed, although some 
browsers close elements when the tags are not 
explicitly included.
All elements must be closed.
One-sided tags are written with the name of the 
tag only, such as <br> for a line break.
One-sided tags must be closed by including a 
space and a forward slash in the tag, such as 
<br /> for a line break.
HTML specifications that are not included when newer specifications are released or 
are not included in the XHTML specification are referred to as deprecated. In this book, 
you will use the XHTML syntax as much as possible; deprecated elements are referenced 
as such but are still covered because some experts agree that the interoperability of the 
HTML 4.01 and the XHTML 1.1 specifications will result in the continuation of both 
specifications in the near future.
Understanding Tags and Attributes
A Web page includes different elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and bulleted 
lists. In an HTML document, these elements are indicated by codes (called tags) that are 
attached to content. Refer to the Session 8.1 Visual Overview for some examples of the tags 
you can use in an HTML document and how these tags display content in a Web page.
Because tags must identify all the elements in a Web page, you frequently need to 
include one or more sets of tags within other tags. Tags that are included within other 
tags are called nested tags. For example, within a set of tags that identify the beginning 
and end of a paragraph, you might include tags to display certain words in that para-
graph using bold or italic. You might also include tags to identify the font size to use for 
the text in the paragraph.
Tags are either two-sided, such as the paragraph tags that indicate the beginning and 
end of a paragraph, or one-sided. An example of a one-sided tag is the HTML <br> 
tag (or the XHTML <br /> tag), which indicates a line break in a Web page. Generally, 
one-sided tags cause the browser to take a certain action, without regard to turning a 
formatting feature “on” and “off,” like it does for the beginning and end of a paragraph 
or when applying bold formatting to a word or phrase. As you learn more about HTML 
and XHTML, you will use tags and learn which tags represent the various elements in a 
Web page.

WEB 402
Internet | Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages
Some tags include attributes that specify additional information about the content to 
be formatted by the tag. For example, as described in the Session 8.1 Visual Overview, 
the <h1> tag is a two-sided tag that creates a large heading in a Web page. The <h1> 
and </h1> tags can be used to indicate the beginning and end of the heading, respec-
tively. However, you can also include one or more optional attributes in the opening tag 
to describe the heading’s content in other ways, such as indicating the alignment of the 
heading or the font color of its text. For example, the following tag creates a large head-
ing in a Web page that contains red text and is centered on the page:
<h1 style=”text-align: center; color: red”>Heading 1 Content</h1>
When a Web browser interprets this tag, it creates a large heading using the text 
“Heading 1 Content,” centers it on the page, and displays it in a bold, red font color. 
This syntax conforms to XHTML specifications by using quotation marks to enclose the 
attribute values.
Some attributes are optional; others are not. You might be familiar with a Web page 
that contains a form with text boxes into which you might type your first name, last 
name, and phone number; a group of option buttons so you can select your age group, 
with options such as 18 to 25 or 26 to 35; or a check box that you click to authorize the 
site to send information to your email address. An HTML document uses the <input /> 
tag to create the various inputs on the form, such as the text box or option button. In the 
<input /> tag, the type attribute is required because it is necessary to specify the type 
of object to create. For example, setting the type attribute to “radio” creates an option 
button on the page. (An option button was originally called a radio button, and this is 
where the attribute gets its name.) If you omit the value for the type attribute, the browser 
doesn’t know what kind of object to create. However, assigning a default value of “yes” 
or “no” to indicate the status of the object when the browser loads the page is optional; 
if you omit this attribute, the browser will apply the default option, which creates an 
unselected object (such as an empty check box). For example, the following tag creates 
a check box named “list” with the initial value of “yes” (indicating a checked check box):
<input type=”checkbox” name=”list” value=”yes” />
When a Web browser interprets this tag, it creates a check box that contains a check 
mark. The name of the check box in the HTML document is “list.” This syntax conforms 
to XHTML specifications by using quotation marks to enclose the attribute values, and a 
space and a forward slash to close the one-sided tag.
As you work more with HTML, you will learn which attributes you must use with 
which tags, and which attributes are optional.
Planning an HTML Document
To create a Web page, you can use a text editor, a simple program that includes multiple 
features for working with Web pages and Web sites, or a program that includes func-
tionality to convert your document to a Web page. An example of a text editor is the 
Notepad program that is included on computers running the Windows operating system. 
When you use a text editor to create a Web page, you type the content of the Web page 
and the tags that you need to format the content. In this case, you must have a thorough 
understanding of HTML and be able to manage the document structure and enter the 
tags on your own. The second option is to use a program such as Microsoft Expression 
Web or Adobe Dreamweaver. These programs provide a graphical user interface (GUI) 
in which you type the content of your Web page and use toolbar buttons and menus to 
format it. The program creates all of the necessary tags to format the Web page. The third 
option is to convert your document to a format that a browser can display, such as when 
you use the Save As command in Microsoft Word to save your document as a Web page.
All heading tags create 
bold text.

Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages | Internet
No matter which approach you use, it is important to understand some basic HTML 
before you begin working. You will use Notepad to create the Web page for Chief Silva. 
Figure 8-2 shows the Web page that she wants you to create.
Chief Silva’s page includes several elements. The first line of the page contains a head-
ing that is centered and formatted using a larger, bolder font than other text in the page. 
As you have learned, an HTML document uses tags to format text. The tags that format 
the headings, such as the document’s title, “Lakeside Police Department,” are called 
heading tags, as shown in the Session 8.1 Visual Overview. Because this document’s title 
is a level-one heading, you will code it with the <h1> tag.
The subtitle, “Women’s Self-Defense Class,” is a level-two heading, so it is coded with 
an <h2> tag. In addition to using the <h2> tag, you will include attributes to change 
the font color to red. You can create any one of 16 million colors using HTML tags. 
However, color is an element that depends on the user’s computer and browser to render 
it correctly. Most computers and operating systems will display the colors in the Web-
safe color palette correctly. The Web-safe color palette is a collection of 216 colors that 
all computers render in the same way. 
The paragraph below the subtitle is a normal paragraph that uses 12-point Times 
New Roman font, the default font for Web pages. The fonts displayed in a Web page 
depend on which fonts are installed on the user’s computer. When an operating system 
is installed on your computer, certain fonts are installed automatically. As you install 
different programs on your computer, the programs might install new fonts. For example, 
when you install a Microsoft Office program, you might install new fonts on your com-
puter at the same time. You might also install new fonts by downloading them from Web 
sites or by installing a font program that you purchased. 
In any case, the fonts that are available on your computer are not always the same 
ones that are available on other computers. When you create a Web page on your com-
puter, you can use any one of the installed fonts on your computer to change the font in 
the Web page. A good rule for beginning Web page developers is to use fonts that are 
considered to be common on all computers. Figure 8-3 identifies the fonts that are com-
monly installed on all computers that run the Windows operating system. Computers 
that run other operating systems have equivalent fonts.

INSIGHT
Using Fonts in a Web Page
If you limit the fonts in your Web pages to the basic fonts shown in Figure 8-3, nearly all 
of the people who view your Web page will see the exact same fonts when they view 
the page on their computers. If you use other fonts, some of your page’s viewers will 
see the fonts if they are installed on their computers; users without the fonts will see an 
equivalent font that the browser substitutes. There are ways to include a wider variety 
of fonts in a Web page; for example, a Web developer can embed fonts in the Web 
site so that all users can display the specific font the developer used. However, there 
are trade-offs when you create a Web page that uses embedded fonts. When pages 
contain embedded fonts, the files that must be downloaded to each user’s computer 
are much larger. As an HTML beginner, you should use the commonly installed fonts on 
all computers to ensure that they are displayed correctly when viewed by others.
The paragraph in the Web page that you will create for Chief Silva also includes two 
nested elements: the italicized sentence and the bold class date and time. Also, the list 
of items below the paragraph is formatted as a bulleted list. The items in the list in Chief 
Silva’s sketch appear with the default bullet characters for Web pages. After you finish the 
Web page, Chief Silva will ask you to create other pages and to format the items in this 
bulleted list as hyperlinks that open the documents describing the self-defense classes for 
the elderly, children, and the disabled.

Trouble?  If you don’t have the starting Data Files for this tutorial, you need to 
get them before you can proceed. Your instructor will either give you the Data 
Files or ask you to obtain them from a specified location (such as a network 
drive). In either case, make a backup copy of the Data Files before you start so 
that you will have the original files available in case you need to start over. If you 
have any questions about the Data Files, see your instructor or technical support 
person for assistance.

2.	 If necessary, maximize the Notepad program window.
◗	
3.	 Click File on the menu bar, click Save to open the Save As dialog box, and then 
navigate to and select the Tutorial.08\Tutorial folder included with your Data 
Files. You will store your HTML document in this location.
◗	
4.	 If necessary, select any text in the File name text box, and then type 
women_sd.html.
◗	
5.	 Click the Save button. The title bar now displays the filename women_sd.html.
You created a text file with the .html filename extension; the .html filename exten-
sion identifies the file as a Web page. (Sometimes you’ll see the .htm filename extension 
used for a Web page, which is also correct. In this book, you’ll use the .html filename 
extension.)
If your computer does not 
have Notepad, you can 
use any word-processing 
program to create an 
HTML document. 
Make sure that you save 
your HTML documents 
with the filename exten-
sion .html; otherwise, 
Web browsers will not 
recognize the file as a 
Web page.

Decision Making: File Naming Conventions for HTML Documents
When creating a Web site for the first time, following some common file naming conven-
tions as you decide how to name your Web page files will ensure that your Web site is 
easy to use and manage. Different organizations might use their own in-house standards to 
ensure a well-organized site. Some common rules for naming files are as follows:
• When saving HTML documents, consider using all lowercase letters in the filenames. 
Although most Web servers process uppercase and lowercase letters as the same char-
acters, it’s a good practice to use lowercase letters in filenames in case you ever move 
your Web site to a UNIX server. Because UNIX servers process uppercase and lowercase 
letters as different characters, Web sites hosted on UNIX servers recognize the files 
named “About.html” and “about.html” as different files.
• Avoid using spaces in filenames. Some Web servers do not support filenames that 
contain spaces, and some browsers do not correctly convert the space character to its 
URL-encoded equivalent, %20, resulting in problems when users attempt to access  
the page.
• A commonly used option for making filenames easier to read is to separate words with 
underscore characters. For example, use the filename “about_us.html” instead of 
“about us.html” or “aboutus.html.”
• Choose filenames that reflect the file’s contents to increase the likelihood of search 
engines correctly indexing the file, and also to make it easier for developers and users to 
find files in the site.
• When the organization that operates a site has specific conventions, be sure to under-
stand and follow them. For example, an organization might store all of a site’s images in 
a folder on the server named “images.”
• Choose short filenames to make it easier for users to type specific URLs into the brows-
er’s address bar, and avoid using abbreviated filenames that are difficult to remember.
• Use the filename index or default (and the appropriate filename extension) for a site’s 
home page, so the Web server sends the correct home page for your site when a 
user accesses the Web site using only the domain name. For example, when a user 
types the domain name www.cengage.com in the browser’s address bar instead of the 
domain name and a filename (www.cengage.com/index.html), the server will automati-
cally search for a file named “index” or “default,” and then it will display that file in the 
browser. When the home page is named using a nonstandard filename, such as  
“cengage_home.html,” the Web server will not be able to locate a file named “index” 
or “default,” and the server will display an error page or a directory listing of the Web 
site’s contents instead of the site’s home page.
The key to good Web site development is to make sure that you understand and follow 
any file naming conventions that are required, either by the organization or based on the 
type of server to which you have decided to publish your Web site. 
Creating the HTML Document Structure
In addition to saving the file with the .html filename extension, you must also create the 
document structure. As shown in the Session 8.1 Visual Overview, every HTML docu-
ment includes an opening <html> tag to indicate that the file is an HTML document. 
After this opening tag, you need to define the head and body sections of the HTML doc-
ument. A good practice is to start your HTML document by creating the head and body 
sections by typing their opening and closing tags. If you always type your two-sided tags 
in pairs, you won’t make the common mistake of beginners, which is typing the opening 
tag and then forgetting to type the closing tag.

WEB 407
Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages | Internet
To create the head and body sections:
◗	
1.	 Make sure the insertion point is in the first line of the new document.
◗	
2.	 Type the content shown in Figure 8-4 in your HTML document, using lowercase 
letters for the tags and mixed-case letters for the content. Press the Enter key 
twice at the end of each line to create the blank lines shown in the figure.
Trouble?  The figures show the Notepad window for Windows 7. Your Notepad 
window might look slightly different from the ones shown in the figures if you 
are using an earlier version of Windows, but this difference should not cause any 
problems.
◗	
3.	 Click File on the menu bar, and then click Save.
Your HTML document has the required head and body sections and a title. Because 
the browser displays the title on the page tab and also uses it as the default name when 
you use the browser to save the page as a bookmark or favorite, it is important to use a 
title that effectively describes the Web page’s content.
The blank lines you inserted are not necessary for browsers to interpret the HTML 
document. In fact, browsers ignore white space in an HTML document, such as the 
blank spaces between sections. This white space, however, makes your HTML document 
easier to read.
INSIGHT
Using a Document Type Declaration
In the steps and assignments in this tutorial, you won’t include a document type dec-
laration at the beginning of your HTML documents because it is beyond the scope of 
this book. A document type declaration (DTD) is a one-sided tag that tells a browser 
which syntax version of a markup language your document uses. When you omit the 
document type declaration in an HTML document, the browser renders the page using 
something called Quirks mode. In this mode, a browser will render most basic content 
correctly. If you later decide to take a course on HTML, XHTML, or XML programming, 
you will learn that you should always include the correct DTD in your documents so 
browsers will render their elements according to the latest standards.
When you create XHTML documents, the DTD is required; in HTML documents it is 
strongly recommended but optional. You can learn more about DTDs by exploring the 
Markup Language Resources links in the Additional Information section of the Tutorial 8 
Weblinks page.

Internet | Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages
Adding a Comment to an HTML Document
Some organizations request developers to document their Web pages by identifying the 
author, purpose, date created or last updated, and other information as required. To add 
this type of information to an HTML document, you use a comment tag, as shown in the 
Session 8.1 Visual Overview. Information in a comment tag is visible when you view the 
HTML document in a text editor, but is not visible when viewing the page in a browser. 
Just like other tags, a comment can appear on a single line, or it can span multiple 
lines separated by line breaks. Also, you can place comments anywhere in an HTML 
document; you do not need to limit comments to the head section. However, identifying 
information about the HTML document, such as the document’s creator or the date the 
page was last updated, usually appears in the head section because this is where most 
developers look for and store this type of information. Another use of a comment is to 
explain a section of the document to indicate its purpose or to provide notes about how 
the code was developed or is maintained.
Chief Silva asks you to add some information to document the HTML file, and you 
will do so with a comment tag.
To add a comment to the HTML document:
◗	
1.	 Click the insertion point at the end of the line that contains the opening <head> 
tag, and then press the Enter key twice.
◗	
2.	 Type the following comment, replacing the text “Your Name” with your first 
and last names, and replacing the text “Date” with today’s date in the format 
MM/DD/YY. Press the spacebar four times to indent the second, third, and fourth 
lines of code.
<!--Women's Self-Defense page
    Content developed by Mary Silva
    Page created by Your Name
    Date
-->
◗	
3.	 Save the file.
With the document’s structure and documentation in place, you can start adding the 
document’s content.
Inserting and Formatting Headings
The first element in Chief Silva’s page is a centered heading that uses the largest font size 
for headings. You’ll type the opening tag for the heading, the content of the heading, and 
then the closing tag for the heading. To create a level-one heading, you use the <h1> 
tag. To change its alignment to center, you need to add an attribute to the <h1> tag. In 
HTML, you add the align attribute with the center value (<h1 align="center">), but the 
center value is deprecated in XHTML. Therefore, to add a code that is compatible with 
both HTML and XHTML, you will use the style attribute with the text-align: center value 
(<h1 style="text-align: center">).
To add headings to the HTML document:
◗	
1.	 Click the insertion point after the opening <body> tag, and then press the Enter 
key twice.
The <h6> and </h6> tags 
create a heading with the 
smallest font size.

◗	
2.	 Type the following line of code:
<h1>Lakeside Police Department</h1>
This code creates the heading in the Web page. Now you need to add the attri-
bute to center the heading.
◗	
3.	 Change the opening <h1> tag for the heading as follows:
<h1 style=”text-align: center”>
◗	
4.	 Press the End key, press the Enter key twice, and then add the following line of 
code to the HTML document to create the document subtitle:
<h2 style=”text-align: center”>Women's Self-Defense Class</h2>
Now the document includes two headings, both of which will be centered when a 
browser displays the page. Chief Silva’s page shows that the subtitle should use a red 
font. To make this change, you will add another attribute to the <h2> tag to change the 
color to red. When using the style attribute, you can separate multiple values with a 
semicolon.
To change font color:
◗	
1.	 Click the insertion point between the word “center” and the closing quotation 
mark in the <h2> tag to position the insertion point between the “r” in “center” 
and the closing quotation mark.
◗	
2.	 Type ; color: red and then make sure that the opening <h2> tag appears as 
follows:
<h2 style=”text-align: center; color: red”>
Figure 8-5 shows the revised HTML document.
◗	
3.	 Save the file.
As you work in an HTML document, it is a good idea to check your work periodi-
cally in a Web browser to look for problems in your coding and also to make sure that 
the page you are creating looks correct. You can open your HTML document in any Web 
browser by using the File menu in the browser.

Creating a List
HTML supports three kinds of lists: bulleted, numbered, and definition. A bulleted list 
(also called an unordered list) contains a list of items with a bullet character to the left of 
each item in the list. The default bullet character might be a black dot or a black square, 
depending on the browser you are using. A numbered list (also called an ordered list) 
creates a list of items with sequential numbering for each item. A definition list is usu-
ally associated with terms and their definitions. For example, you might use a definition 
list to create a list of terms and then format each term’s description as part of the list. 
Figure 8-9 shows the syntax and an example for each type of list.

Using Images in an HTML Document
You have learned that HTML documents are text documents. So how do you display an 
image in a text document? Most Web pages contain some kind of image, such as a photo 
or a computer-generated image. In HTML, an image is any file that contains a picture, 
such as a photograph, logo, or computer-generated file. To include an image in a Web 
page, it must be stored as a file. This file might be a digital picture purchased from a 
company or a digital picture taken with a digital camera. If you have permission to use 
it, you could also include a scanned copy of an image that exists on paper or a digital 
version of a clip-art image found at a Web site.
INSIGHT
Using Pictures in Web Pages
Pictures can be saved in a variety of file formats, but some formats are commonly used 
on the Web because they provide high-quality images with small file sizes and fast 
download times. The most popular formats for pictures on the Web are JPG (or JPEG), 
GIF, and PNG. Each of these file formats has advantages and disadvantages. Most 
people use the JPG format for photographs and complex images because JPG files 
support up to 16 million colors. Because GIF files are limited to 256 colors, they are a 
good choice for scanned images, line drawings, and simple graphics. The GIF format is 
licensed by Unisys, and programs that create GIF files must have a license to output files 
in this format. (You do not need a license, however, to use a GIF file in a Web page.) 
PNG files are similar to GIF files but support up to 16 million colors, and creating PNG 
files does not require a license. Nearly all Web browsers support JPG, GIF, and PNG 
files. However, some older versions of browsers do not support PNG files; therefore, the 
PNG format is not as popular on the Web as the JPG and GIF formats.

WEB 415
Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages | Internet
To use an image in an HTML document, you must create a reference to the file loca-
tion where the image is stored. If the image is stored in the same folder as the HTML 
document, then the browser loads the image from the same folder. If the image is stored 
anywhere else, the reference to it in the HTML document must include the path to the 
folder or drive on which the image is stored.
To reference the image in the HTML document, you include the one-sided <img /> 
tag in the location in which you want to insert the image. When you use the <img /> 
tag, you must also include the src attribute to define the location (the “source”) of the 
image. You can also use the optional height, width, border, and alt attributes. The height 
and width attributes describe the image’s height and width in pixels; a pixel is a single 
point in an image. The border attribute describes the image’s border size (also in pixels). 
The alt attribute provides alternate text that identifies the image’s function or description 
when it is loaded by a browser that either does not display images or reads Web page 
content for visually impaired users. Because the alt attribute is required in XHTML, you 
should always include the alt attribute in your <img /> tag. For example, the code to 
load the image saved as lpd_logo.jpg into a Web page is as follows:
<img src=”lpd_logo.jpg” alt=”Lakeside Police Department logo” />
This code tells the browser that the file lpd_logo.jpg is located in the same folder as 
the HTML document in which it appears. This type of reference is called a relative path. 
A relative path specifies a file’s location relative to the location of the current file. If the 
lpd_logo.jpg file is stored in a folder named “images” on the current drive, then the code 
to load the image is as follows:
<img src=”../images/lpd_logo.jpg” alt=”Lakeside Police Department 
logo” />
This reference is also a relative path because the .. in the file location indicates that 
the images folder is on the same drive as the current file, but in a different folder. Notice 
that the slash characters in the path are forward slashes. If the file is stored on a com-
pletely different drive from the current file, then the code is as follows:
<img src=”c:\temp\images\lpd_logo.jpg” alt=”Lakeside Police 
Department logo” />
When the browser interprets this code, it will search drive C on the user’s computer 
for a folder named “temp,” and then within the temp folder, it will search for a folder 
named “images.” Within the images folder, it will search for a file named “lpd_logo.jpg” 
and load it into the Web page. If the user’s computer does not have the temp\images 
folder, or if a file named “lpd_logo.jpg” is not saved in that folder, then the browser will 
display a broken link to the image or the alternate text specified for the image instead of 
displaying the image itself. Because this path is the only path in which the browser will 
search for the file, it is called an absolute path. An absolute path specifies a file’s loca-
tion with absolute precision; there is no reference to the current file.
Most Web developers store all of a Web site’s images in the same folder as the HTML 
document or in a folder on the Web site. Usually this folder’s name is “images.” By 
storing all of the images in one place, it is easy to create the references to those images

To change the text “Lakeside Police Department” to an image, you need to select

Trouble?  If you see the alternate text (in Firefox) or a broken link like the 
one shown in Figure 8-13 instead of the image shown in Figure 8-12, your 
HTML document (women_sd.html) and the lpd_logo.jpg file are stored in dif-
ferent locations. To correct this problem, copy the lpd_logo.jpg file from the 
Tutorial.08\Tutorial folder into the same folder as the HTML document, or move 
the HTML document into the Tutorial.08\Tutorial folder. If you move the HTML 
document, you will need to open the file in the browser from its new location. If 
you move the lpd_logo.jpg file, you will need to refresh the page in the browser.
Using Anchors
Throughout this book, you have used hyperlinks to navigate the pages in a Web site. The 
HTML tag that creates a hyperlink is the anchor tag (<a>). The most common use of a 
hyperlink is to connect the different Web pages in a Web site together. When connecting 
Web pages with a hyperlink, the page that opens when the hyperlink is clicked is called 
the hyperlink’s target or target page. The Web page that contains the hyperlink is called 
the source page. The syntax of a hyperlink that connects a source page with a target page 
is as follows:
<a href=”default.html”>Home Page</a>
The <a> tag is a two-sided tag that includes the href attribute, which specifies the 
filename of the target page. The text “Home Page” indicates the text that will appear as a 
link in the source page. Most browsers underline hyperlinks and display them in a blue 
font so they are easy to identify in a Web page. When you click the “Home Page” link, 
the browser opens the page named “default.html.”
A hyperlink can include a URL to another Web site in the href attribute. When a 
hyperlink connects to a target page on the Web, the href attribute includes the complete 
URL, including the HTTP protocol, as follows:
<a href=”http://www.cengage.com”>Cengage Learning</a>
In this example, clicking the “Cengage Learning” link on the page causes the browser 
to open the home page at the URL for that company.
Most browsers let users 
customize the display 
of hyperlinks, so your 
hyperlinks might look dif-
ferent depending on your 
browser settings.

WEB 418
Internet | Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages
You can also use the <a> tag to include a hyperlink to a location in the same page. 
When a hyperlink is used in this way, it is sometimes called a bookmark. A bookmark 
uses the id attribute to identify locations in a document so that you can create hyper-
links to those locations. A common use of a bookmark is to provide a way of scrolling 
a long Web page to a specific location, or to provide a link that scrolls a Web page to 
the beginning of the page. Creating a bookmark requires two steps. The first step is to 
use the id attribute to name a section in a Web page. For example, you might name the 
image at the top of the women_sd.html page so that it becomes the “top” of the page. To 
accomplish this task, you would change the existing <img /> tag as follows to add the id 
attribute to it:
<img id=”#top” src=”lpd_logo.jpg” alt=”Lakeside Police Department 
logo” />
To create a hyperlink to the named location, you would insert the following code:
<a href=”#top”>Back to top</a>
The text for the hyperlink can be anything you choose; in this case, “Back to top” is 
the text that is displayed in the page.
Adding a Link to a Web Page
You can create a hyperlink at any time when developing a Web page. The trick is to 
make sure that the page is stored in the correct location. For example, if you include a 
link to a filename without a path to the file, the browser will look in the current folder 
for that file. If the file is stored anywhere else, the browser won’t be able to open it. This 
situation represents a common problem when creating hyperlinks. A good way to avoid 
problems is to test the hyperlink by opening the source page in a browser, and then 
clicking the hyperlink to make sure that it opens the correct page. After you publish the 
HTML document to the server, you should do the same testing to make sure that the 
page still opens correctly.
Chief Silva created the page for the self-defense for the elderly class, and now you 
want to create a hyperlink that links your page to her page. The file containing the Web 
page for the self-defense for the elderly class is saved in the Tutorial.08\Tutorial folder.
To create a hyperlink to a file:
◗	
1.	 Switch to your text editor.
◗	
2.	 Click the insertion point to the right of the first opening <li> tag in the bulleted 
list, and then type the opening tag for the hyperlink, which includes a hyperlink 
to the file elder_sd.html:
<a href=”elder_sd.html”>
◗	
3.	 Click to the right of the word “Elderly” on the same line, and then type the clos-
ing tag for the hyperlink, </a>. Figure 8-14 shows the HTML document.

4.	 Save the file, switch to your browser, and then refresh the page. The first item 
in the bulleted list is formatted as a hyperlink. For most browsers, the default 
formatting for a hyperlink is underlined, blue text.
◗	
5.	 Click the Self-Defense for the Elderly link. The Self-Defense for the Elderly page 
opens in your browser.
Trouble?  If the elder_sd.html page does not open, then the files for the target 
and source pages are not stored in the same folder. Move the files into the same 
folder, reopen the source page (women_sd.html) in your browser, and then click 
the hyperlink.
◗	
6.	 Click your browser’s Back button to return to the women_sd.html page.
◗	
7.	 If you enabled the display of the menu bar in Internet Explorer or Firefox earlier 
in this session, right-click the menu bar to open the shortcut menu, and then click 
Menu bar (in Internet Explorer) or Menu Bar (in Firefox) to hide the menu bar.

Many Web hosting companies 
also provide domain name 
services, so you might be able 
to locate and purchase your 
domain name as part of your 
Web hosting agreement. You 
can also purchase a domain 
name from a domain name 
registrar.
When you are ready to move your 
Web site’s files to the Web server, 
the Web hosting company will give 
you a user name and password and 
directions for where and how to 
upload the files.
You can use HTML <meta> 
tags with appropriate 
keyword attributes to teach 
search engines how to list 
your site. You can also send 
your Web site’s URL to 
various search engines on 
the Web.
Considering your technical needs and 
establishing a domain name will help 
you to select the best Web hosting 
service to use to publish and promote 
your Web site.

Internet | Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages
Evaluating Web Site Content
Now that you understand some basic tags used to create HTML documents, you need to 
consider how Web pages are collected and organized to create a Web site. As shown in 
the Session 8.2 Visual Overview, the first step is to determine the goals for your Web site 
and to plan the content for the Web pages you want to include in the site. A storyboard 
can help identify the general content for each page, the number of pages in the site, and 
the relationship between the site’s pages. 
Figure 8-16 shows a sample storyboard for the community education pages in the 
Lakeside Police Department Web site. Notice that the home page appears at the top of 
the storyboard with two levels of pages below it. The pages in the second row include 
hyperlinks to the home page and to each other, with each page including additional 
hyperlinks to the pages below it in the storyboard. When a Web site is presented in this 
way, it is also called the site’s navigation structure because it shows the path of naviga-
tion through the site.
As you evaluate how many pages you’ll include and how they will be related to each 
other, you should also examine the planned content for each page. Most pages will con-
tain standard content, such as images, text, and hyperlinks. However, your plan might 
include pages with more advanced content that will require the use of specialized tools 
to develop. 
For example, the site might include pages that process information, such as collect-
ing data supplied by the user, which is then stored in a database or other file. The Web 
page is still an HTML document, but the processing that is required by this type of page 
requires action by the Web server on which the page is stored. The Web server must col-
lect the data and save it in the specified format (such as comma-delimited, in which the 
data is stored in a text file and data from individual fields is separated by commas, or in 
a table in a database). The Web server must rely on a script to process the data collected 
by the Web page. You can write these scripts yourself, but a better option is to find a 
company that provides code snippets to help you process user-entered data.

Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages | Internet
Using a Web Site Management Tool
You could use a text editor to create all of the pages in a Web site. In this case, you would 
need to have a thorough understanding of how to write all of the tags and attributes that 
are required to complete your site. Although it is possible to create an entire Web site, 
regardless of its complexity, using just Notepad and HTML, Web developers rely on  
other options for creating Web sites. Microsoft Expression Web and Adobe Dreamweaver 
are two Web site creation and management tools. These stand-alone programs use a 
graphical user interface (GUI) to generate the HTML documents necessary to produce 
Web pages. 
Figure 8-17 shows the Web page that you created in Session 8.1 after creating it in 
Expression Web. Notice that the page looks the same as it would in a Web browser. The 
toolbars and panels include tools that let you format text, create hyperlinks, and perform 
other tasks that are supported by HTML and XHTML.
By clicking the Code button at the bottom of the Expression Web window, you can 
see the HTML document for the current Web page. Figure 8-18 shows the HTML docu-
ment that Expression Web generated to produce the page shown in Figure 8-17. Notice 
that Expression Web uses styles to define text formatting, instead of the tags that you 
used in the HTML document you created in Notepad. A style is a collection of format-
ting instructions that the Web browser applies to text. The code generated by Expression 
Web is slightly different from what you entered in your HTML document, but it produces 
the same result. The main difference is that the generated code is XHTML compatible.

Clicking the Code button at the top of the document window in Dreamweaver 
shows the HTML document that Dreamweaver generated for the Web page shown in 
Figure 8-19. Figure 8-20 shows that Dreamweaver also generates code that is compatible 
with XHTML 1.0—for example, the beginning of the HTML document includes a docu-
ment type declaration, and one-sided tags are closed with a space and a slash. In addi-
tion, notice that the <i> tags are replaced by <em> (for “emphasis”) tags and the <b> 
tags are replaced by <strong> tags. These tags are used in anticipation of the deprecation 
of the current HTML 4.01 tags for creating italic and bold text.
Using a Web site management tool such as Expression Web or Dreamweaver reduces 
the need for the developer to understand the syntax of all the tags and attributes that 
create Web pages. These tools also provide other benefits by simplifying some of the 
tasks needed to complete a Web site. Both programs simplify the process of adding 
multimedia, such as animation, movies, and sound, to your Web pages by incorporating 
drag-and-drop interfaces that let you place the multimedia object in a page and auto-
matically generate the necessary code to support it. These programs also include code 
snippets that create animations in your Web pages and tools that let you check the entire 
Web site for broken links and other problems. Next, you’ll explore the product pages for 
Expression Web and Dreamweaver to get a better sense of the features available in these 
powerful programs.

Both Expression Web and Dreamweaver offer free trial versions of the software that 
you can download and use before purchasing a license. These trial programs are a good 
way to decide which program will best help you manage your Web site, and which will 
be the easiest for you to use.
Choosing Other Development Tools
Some Web pages include content that is beyond the capabilities of HTML. For example, 
you learned in Session 8.1 that an HTML document cannot store an image, but it can 
include a reference to an image and display it. The HTML tag and its attributes identify 
the location of the image file and, optionally, its height and width dimensions, border 
size, and alternate text.
Other nontext content that you see in a Web page is called by the browser in a similar 
way. Some Web pages include dynamic content—content that changes when you view 
the page—that is also beyond the capabilities of HTML. This dynamic content might 
be an image that represents the number of times a page has been viewed, an animated 
graphic, or an interactive product display. This type of Web page content requires more 
than just HTML to produce. Because Chief Silva might want to include interactive 
features in the police department’s Web pages, you will explore some of the technology 
required to produce more complicated Web pages, such as those that include program-
ming, image editing, and animation.
Programming with JavaScript
JavaScript is a scripting language that was originally developed as “LiveScript” by 
Brendan Eich while he was working as a programmer at Netscape Communications 
Corporation. A scripting language is a programming language that is executed by a Web 
browser. To process the script, the browser must have a feature called a scripting engine. 
The browser’s scripting engine translates the code in the script into a format that the 
browser can execute. 
JavaScript was originally available as part of the Netscape Navigator browser. At the 
same time, Microsoft created a compatible language called JScript, and subsequently, the 
language VBScript, both of which are processed by Internet Explorer. Because JavaScript 
is interpreted by most browsers, and because only the Internet Explorer browser can 
process scripts written in VBScript, most developers choose JavaScript to extend the func-
tionality of a Web page.
The most common use of JavaScript is to perform tasks that are not possible in the 
static world of HTML documents. For example, a Web page might use a very simple 
JavaScript program to greet visitors depending on the time of day they view the page. 
Figure 8-22 shows the result of a JavaScript program that greets the user. The script uses 
the page title from the HTML document and a greeting of “Good morning!” because the 
visitor loaded the page in the morning.

Figure 8-23 shows the HTML document for the page shown in Figure 8-22. The 
HTML document includes a script that provides the greeting, the date, and the day of 
the week. The script itself is embedded in the body section of the HTML document. 
When you view the HTML document in a Web browser, the browser executes the script 
and displays the result of the script in the Web page. Most scripts are embedded in an 
HTML document in this way. When a browser cannot execute the script (because it does 
not have a scripting engine to process the script), it simply displays the contents of the 
script as text. To avoid this situation, most scripts are enclosed in HTML comment tags so 
browsers that cannot execute the script will ignore the script as if it were really a com-
ment. If the browser has a compatible scripting engine, the scripting engine ignores the 
HTML comment tags and processes the script.
Although you can take courses to learn JavaScript and other languages, many Web 
sites include resources for downloading and using free scripts written in JavaScript 
in your Web pages. In return for the use of the script, some sites ask you to include a 
link to the developer’s Web site in lieu of payment. Other Web resources that provide 
more complex scripts require payment for their use. Figure 8-22 includes a link to The 
JavaScript Source, a resource that includes more than 1,400 free scripts that you can use 
in your Web pages. You’ll explore these resources next and view some scripts.

INSIGHT
Using JavaScript to Enhance a Web Page
What can you do with JavaScript without having to learn how to write your own scripts? 
You can use a script to display a greeting based on the time of the day, the day of the 
week, or a special occasion. You can display a calendar or an interactive calendar that 
lets the user pick a date. You can also display the current date and time, or a countdown 
until a specific day and time, such as a holiday or a grand opening. You can also use 
JavaScript to display scrolling text, a drop-down menu of selections, or animated but-
tons that change color or display a message when the user points to or clicks a button. 
A script might also detect the user’s browser version or open a pop-up window with a 
message. JavaScript adds other functionality to a Web page as well, such as a simple or 
scientific calculator. Most of the scripts for performing these tasks are available for free 
on the Web.
When you use a script to add functionality to a Web page, you provide content in 
your Web page that is beyond the basic capabilities of HTML. You also provide your 
page’s users with tools that enhance their interaction with your Web site.

Creating Animated Content
Although JavaScript can add some interactivity to your Web pages, you might be won-
dering how some Web sites are able to animate more than just text or buttons. The early 
versions of Web browsers displayed only text and simple images. As commercial use 
of the Internet flourished, Web site developers needed a way to include more features, 
such as sound and animation, in their Web pages. Because of HTML limitations, compa-
nies developed their own software to enhance the capabilities of Web browsers. These 
enhancements, generally called browser extensions, allow a Web browser to perform 
tasks it was not originally designed to perform.
There are three types of browser extensions. One type is called a plug-in; in this cat-
egory, you will find integrated browser software that the browser uses to display or play a 
specific file that you request. Other browser extensions are called helper applications, or 
programs installed on the user’s computer that the browser starts and uses to “help” dis-
play or play a file. The third category, add-ons, includes tools that enhance your brows-
ing experience, such as toolbars that let you access a search engine without opening its 
Web site, or programs that block pop-up ads and other windows from opening when you 
view a Web site.
Plug-ins differ slightly from helper applications in the way they run. Helper applica-
tions are independent programs that are stored on your computer and are useful on their 
own. They are activated automatically by a browser when needed. For example, when a 
browser starts a spreadsheet program to display a spreadsheet, the spreadsheet program is 
functioning as a helper application; when a browser encounters a sound file, the browser 
might start a media player that acts as a helper application to play the file. Your computer 
probably has many helper applications already installed on it that your browser uses to 
display a variety of file formats that you encounter as you browse the Web.
Plug-ins, on the other hand, do their work inside the browser and do not activate a 
stand-alone program that is stored on your computer. Unlike helper applications, plug-
ins are not independent programs; they can start only from within a browser. As Web 
developers started including different multimedia files in their Web sites, Microsoft and 
Mozilla began integrating plug-ins with their browsers so users could access and display 
files without needing a separate program.
Figure 8-26 lists some commonly used browser extensions on the Web.

Internet | Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages
Two widely used plug-ins for viewing animated content are Flash Player and 
Shockwave Player. Both players are free from the Adobe Web site, and they work seam-
lessly with most browsers. Flash Player lets your Web browser display simple animations, 
user interfaces, images, movies, sound, and text that was created using Adobe Flash 
software. Flash content usually appears in the same browser window as the page you are 
viewing. According to Adobe, more than 98% of all Internet-enabled desktop comput-
ers in the United States have Flash Player installed and can use Flash Player to view 
enhanced content on the Web. Because Flash Player is the world’s most widely installed 
plug-in for playing enhanced, interactive content on the largest number of computer 
and mobile devices, many Web developers regularly use Flash to develop content that is 
more visually interesting and appealing to their site visitors.
Shockwave Player is a more fully featured browser plug-in. Shockwave Player lets 
you view animated, three-dimensional interfaces, interactive advertisements and prod-
uct demonstrations, multiuser games, streaming CD-quality audio, and video that was 
created using Adobe Director software. Because Shockwave uses streaming technology, 
you do not need to wait for an entire file to download before playing it—the anima-
tion or sound plays almost immediately. (Remember from Tutorial 4 that streaming is 
a technology that delivers a continuous flow of information from the server to your 
browser and allows you to play the information, such as audio or video, before the entire 
file has been downloaded to your computer. Streaming can reduce the time required to 
begin playing a file from several minutes to several seconds.) Shockwave content usu-
ally appears in a new browser window. Some instructors use Shockwave to deliver audio 
instruction and interact with students over the Internet just as they would in the class-
room. Shockwave is a very popular plug-in; according to Adobe, more than 450 million 
Internet users enhance their Internet experience using Shockwave Player to play games 
and view animated content.
You can purchase the Adobe Director program to create Shockwave files and the 
Adobe Flash program to create Flash files. Chief Silva might want to use animations in 
the Lakeside Police Department’s Web site, so you will explore these resources to get a 
sense of what Flash and Shockwave can do. 
To view Flash and Shockwave demos:
◗	
1.	 In the Session 8.2 section of the Tutorial 8 Weblinks page, click a link in the Flash 
Demos section, and watch the Flash animation. Many Web sites use Flash to 
animate content that users can interact with. Figure 8-27 shows an example of a 
Web site that uses Flash to animate the characters in a story and provides tools 
that let children interact with the story’s characters.

Internet | Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages
Decision Making: Deciding When to Use Director and Flash
From your exploration of the demos, you probably already noticed a few differences 
between Flash and Shockwave. The first difference that you might have noticed is that 
Flash is used on a smaller scale, for items such as simple animations or games with sound 
and images. Shockwave is used for more complex applications, such as playing a multi-
featured, interactive game or running a kiosk you might find at a mall. Second, you might 
have noticed that Flash animations load quickly in a browser because Flash outputs much 
smaller files than Director. Several other differences that you might not have seen from the 
demos are that Flash is a simpler program to learn and use than Director, Flash is much 
less expensive to purchase than Director, and Flash Player is a much more widely distrib-
uted plug-in than Shockwave Player.
Because Flash Player is installed on most desktop computers and mobile devices, Web 
developers know that most of their site’s users will be able to view animations created 
using Flash. When deciding to use Flash or Shockwave, this is perhaps one of the most 
important considerations because you want to make sure that people can view your Web 
site content.
If Flash is well suited for many Web applications, when would you decide to use 
Director? Flash and Director share many features, but Director includes many more robust 
features that are required for creating larger, more interactive applications. You will need 
to use Director when your application requires more than just simple animation with video, 
sound, and images. Director is a multimedia authoring tool that can be used to create 
interactive content for the Internet, CDs, DVDs, and kiosks that include photo-quality 
images, digital video, animation, three-dimensional presentations, text content, hyper-
links, and Flash content. You might use Flash to bring a home page in a Web site to life; 
you would use Director to create a game for the Internet or to create full-featured prod-
uct demonstrations that let users control the animation, sound, and video that they are 
viewing.
Creating content using Flash and Director is both fun and easy. If creating this type of 
content appeals to you, you might take a course in Flash animation or a general course 
in Web site animation.
Choosing Image Editing and Illustration Programs
You learned in Session 8.1 that you can insert an image into an HTML document by stor-
ing the image in a file and using the <img /> tag to insert the file into the Web page. An 
image can be any picture, including one you take with a digital camera or create using a 
drawing or illustration program. Computer-generated graphics come in two basic variet-
ies: raster (also called bitmap) and vector. The main difference between the two graphics 
types is that raster graphics are composed of pixels, and vector graphics are composed 
of paths. Figure 8-28 shows the letter “S” that was created using Paint, a program that is 
installed with the Windows operating system. Paint is an example of a program that cre-
ates raster graphics, also called bitmap images.

WEB 437
Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages | Internet
Raster graphics use the filename extensions .bmp, .gif, .jpg, .png, and .tif. Graphics 
with these filename extensions are created using a variety of programs, including Paint, 
Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Fireworks, and Corel PaintShop Photo Pro. In addition, any 
image that you take using a digital camera or make using a scanner is a raster graphic. 
Because raster graphics are made up of pixels, it is not possible to create layers of con-
tent. If you draw a circle using a raster graphics program, and then use a text tool to add 
a word on top of the circle, the pixels in the text replace the ones in the circle. If you 
later decide to cut the text out of the circle, you’ll be left with a hole where the text once 
was, not the original circle that you drew. In addition, raster graphics are not scalable; 
if you zoom in on an image created using a raster graphics program, you’ll see ragged 
edges on the image because you cannot change the size of the pixels in the image.
Figure 8-29 shows the letter “S” that was created using Adobe Illustrator. Illustrator is 
an example of a program that creates vector graphics.

WEB 438
Internet | Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages
Vector graphics use the filename extensions .ai, .wmf, .cdr, and .dxf. Graphics with 
these filename extensions are created using programs such as Illustrator, CorelDRAW, 
and AutoCAD. Vector graphics are scalable, which means that their edges are smooth 
at any resolution. In addition, you can layer content in a vector graphic. In the same 
example using a circle with text on top of it, the text is a layer on top of the circle. In 
other words, the circle exists separately from the text, and vice versa. Because of this 
difference, vector graphics are best suited for drawing objects. Each object on a canvas 
has a certain dimension and color, and the program makes the distinction between the 
different objects on a canvas for you.
Why is this difference important? Depending on the type of image that you want to 
create, you might need to select a program specifically designed for that purpose. Raster 
graphics are the choice for photographs and images with different levels of shading. 
Vector graphics are the choice when you need to create drawings that require lines and 
curves to form different shapes. For these reasons, raster graphics require the use of a 
category of programs called image editing programs, and vector graphics require the use 
of a category of programs called illustration software. Some programs, such as Fireworks 
and Photoshop, do both, but most programs are geared primarily toward one category of 
graphic or the other.
Most beginning Web page developers can use a simple program such as Paint to 
draw basic images and create simple logos. An image editing program such as Adobe 
Photoshop is a good choice for someone who takes a lot of digital pictures and fre-
quently needs to resize, crop, and retouch the images. Most image editing programs 
include a basic tool palette that lets you perform simple tasks that are common to 
creating and editing images. Learning how to use illustration software, however, usu-
ally requires a more thorough understanding gained from taking a course. The Tutorial 8 
Weblinks page includes links to the programs discussed in this section and other 
resources for working with images.

Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages | Internet
Choosing a Web Hosting Service
After you have evaluated your Web site goals, planned your content, and determined 
the tools you will use to manage and create the Web site, you are ready to choose a 
Web hosting service or a Web presence provider to host your Web site. Some Web sites 
are hosted by private (dedicated) Web servers that are managed and maintained by the 
organization that creates the site. However, many Web sites are hosted by independent 
ISPs that sell server space to small- and medium-sized businesses. If you decide to use 
your own servers to host and maintain your Web site, it is important to have a thorough 
understanding of what is involved in upgrading your server space and services in case 
your initial plan changes over time. 
If you decide to use a Web hosting service or Web presence provider, it is a good idea 
to select a Web hosting service before you begin work on actually creating the Web site’s 
pages. The choice of a Web hosting service is more than just one of affordability—it is 
important to understand the types of Web servers the company uses, the software it uses 
to run the servers, and what services the company offers. You can then determine if the 
company’s services and technology meet the requirements of your Web site’s content.  
Understanding Types of Web Servers
The type of Web server the Web hosting company uses can be important. Some types 
of pages that you might want to include in a Web site require a certain kind of server 
to process them. For example, if your site uses Active Server Pages (ASP), which are 
dynamic Web pages based on the content stored in a database, you’ll need to store the 
site on a Windows-based Web server because the UNIX and Linux Web servers do not 
support ASP. It is important to identify the technologies that you’ll use in your site to 
make sure that the company’s Web server supports them. You don’t want to create a Web 
site and later find out, for example, that your Web hosting company’s Web server doesn’t 
support the types of pages you created.
If any of your site’s pages require users to supply information that is personal or 
confidential in nature, then you will need a secure server. A secure server encrypts 
data, which changes it into a format that prevents unauthorized parties from being able 
to read or use it. Some common situations that require a secure server are credit card 
transactions and forms that require a user to enter a Social Security number or other 
private data. When you need a secure server, the Web hosting service will require you to 
purchase and use a dedicated server. A dedicated server is a Web server that hosts only 
one site, compared to a shared server, which hosts several sites. A dedicated server is 
more expensive to operate. You will also need to install a server certificate as a method 
of proving your site’s security features to its users.
Understanding the Site’s File Size and Transfer Requirements
Because they are text files, most Web pages are small in terms of file size. However, a 
Web site can be very large if it contains many digital pictures, images, and supporting 
files such as a database or Shockwave or Flash files. For example, if you are a real estate 
agent, your site might include hundreds of digital photographs and virtual video tours of

WEB 440
Internet | Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages
the homes that you have listed for sale. These files will require a lot of storage space. In 
addition, you need to consider the amount of traffic your site will receive and the sizes 
of the files that users will download from the Web server. The HTML document for a 
property listing might be 1,000 bytes (which is very small). But the pictures of the house 
and the video files of the main living areas might be several megabytes each. When a 
user downloads the Web page, the user’s browser must also download the image and 
video files, resulting in the transfer of several megabytes of data. 
The amount of data that is transferred from the Web server is known as the site’s 
bandwidth or data transfer. Most companies sell server space based on a file size limit 
and a daily or monthly data transfer limit. When you exceed either of these limits, you 
might incur extra fees from the Web hosting service. In addition, your Web hosting 
service might not be able to increase your Web site’s server space or bandwidth, which 
means that you would need to transfer your Web site to another company that can 
handle your site’s file size and bandwidth requirements. Moving a Web site isn’t an easy 
task, so you’ll want to make sure that your Web hosting service can handle not only your 
current needs, but your anticipated needs for the future, as well.
Evaluating Other Services Offered by a Web Hosting Service
Finally, you should evaluate other useful services offered by the Web hosting service, 
such as site statistics, email accounts, Web site templates, Web site construction tools, 
database software, domain name management services, and technical support. You 
might need to pay an extra fee to obtain detailed site traffic reports, but this information 
is helpful when analyzing who is visiting your site and which pages they are viewing. 
You can use a traffic report to get detailed information, such as how many visitors used 
the site each day, how many pages the visitors viewed, which pages visitors used to enter 
and exit the Web site, what search strings were entered into the Web site’s search feature, 
and so on. Analyzing a site’s traffic is an important way of understanding who is using 
the site and what information they are seeking. If you use this information correctly, 
you’ll be able to understand the site’s visitors, and organize and design the site to better 
serve them.
You can use a registrar such as Network Solutions, whose home page is shown in 
Figure 8-30, or a similar registrar to enter your proposed domain name and check its 
availability.

If the domain name you want is available, you can purchase it directly from the 
registrar, or some Web hosting services will purchase the domain name for you. If you 
purchase your domain name from the Web hosting service that you decide to use, when 
you renew your Web site hosting agreement, the Web hosting service might automati-
cally renew your domain name for you. This convenience saves you a step and ensures 
that your domain name does not expire and become eligible for sale to another entity if 
you forget or neglect to renew it.
You might also want to make sure that the company you select to host your site has 
technical support services available to you when you need them, especially if you are a

new Web site developer. When you talk to people at the Web hosting service, try to get a 
sense of the level of support and service that it provides. For example, you can ask ques-
tions about the amount of server downtime it has experienced in the past month, how 
many hours a day and days a week that technical support personnel answer the phone, 
and any online resources that the company provides. When you view the online help 
resources, you can get a sense of the company’s intended audience and whether it will 
assist you with future questions. If everything is written for advanced programmers, then 
you’ll have to get more outside help than you would if the pages include basic informa-
tion that is written in a clear and concise way for beginners.
You’ll examine a few Web hosting services next to get a sense of the types of services 
and plans that they offer so you can report back to Chief Silva and recommend a choice.
To review Web hosting services:
◗	
1.	 In the Session 8.2 section of the Tutorial 8 Weblinks page, click one of the 
Choosing a Web Hosting Service links.
◗	
2.	 Review the site’s home page, and then open a page that lists different Web host-
ing companies by name.

3.	 Click a link to a company, and then examine the services that the Web hosting 
service provides. Figure 8-31 shows the home page for IPOWER.com, a company 
that provides Web hosting solutions for companies and individuals with different 
needs. As you are examining the hosting agreements, keep in mind the informa-
tion you’ve learned about Web hosting. For example, be alert for different levels 
of service and whether the company lets you upgrade your server space and data

Internet | Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages
Publishing a Web Site
After you choose a Web hosting service to host your Web site, the next step is to move 
your files to the company’s Web server. Your Web hosting service should give you infor-
mation about what user name and password to use, and where and how to upload the 
files. Most companies will ask you to use FTP to move your files. In some cases, you’ll 
need an FTP program to make the transfer; but some companies include a built-in FTP 
interface that you access as part of your Web site’s control panel. (A control panel is a 
Web page that you access with your Web site’s user name and password; it includes all 
the tools you need to access and manage your Web site.) If you are using a Web site 
management program, you might be able to use the program to publish your site by set-
ting up a remote Web site at the location of your Web server.
When you move your Web site’s files to the Web server, be sure to include all of 
the folders and supporting files, not just the Web site’s HTML documents. A common 
mistake made by many beginning Web site developers is omitting the Web site’s support-
ing files, such as images, backgrounds, custom bullet characters, and multimedia files. 
If your HTML documents contain hyperlinks to supporting files that use relative paths, 
be certain to include the supporting files in the same folders as the HTML documents, 
or the links will be broken in your Web pages. If your HTML documents contain hyper-
links to supporting files that use absolute paths, make sure that the location of the file in 
the absolute path is available to the Internet user. For example, if a linked file is on your 
computer’s hard drive, you will be able to view the file, but a person accessing the page 
from a Web server will not because he or she will not have access to your computer.
The best strategy for maintaining a Web site after you publish it for the first time is 
to make your changes to the copy of the Web site that you stored on your hard drive or 
other local drive, and then to move those files to the Web server. By having a copy of 
the Web site on your hard drive or other local drive (often called a local Web site), you 
have a backup of your Web site. If something happens to the Web site stored on the 
Web server (often called a remote Web site), you will be able to publish the files from 
your local Web site back to the server to repair any damaged or lost files. It is possible 
to make changes directly to the pages on the Web server, but then you would not have 
a complete backup on your local hard drive or server. Also, if you do make changes to 
the Web pages stored on the server, the potential exists for someone to be viewing the 
pages—and having problems with broken links and other issues—while you are editing 
the pages.
Search Engine Submission and Optimization
The last major task in publishing a Web site is promoting it. You can publish your pages 
and wait for search engines to perform crawls and add your site to their indexes. Or, you 
can be proactive and use <meta> tags to teach the search engines how to list your site by 
including the HTML <meta> tag with the appropriate keywords attribute to define your 
site’s primary focus. Figure 8-32 shows the Web page you created in Session 8.1, with 
<meta> tags for a description of your site and keywords inserted in the head section of 
the HTML document.

WEB 445
Tutorial 8 Creating Effective Web Pages | Internet
The description <meta> tag is a summary of the page’s contents that a search engine 
might include in its search results. A search engine examines the keywords in an HTML 
document’s <meta> tags to index the page and identify the search expressions that 
users might type to locate the page. For example, a user who types “Lakeside Police 
Department community education” into a search engine might see a link to the page in 
the search engine’s results based on the keywords stored in the <meta> tag. 
Using <meta> tags is a good way to help search engines list your site, but the search 
engines still need to find the site. To properly promote your site, you can send it to the 
various search engines on the Web. Search engine submission is the process of submit-
ting your site’s URL to one or more search engines so they will list your site in their 
indexes. Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of fine-tuning your site so that 
it ranks well in a search engine’s results when a user searches the Web using your site’s 
keywords.
Your Web hosting service might include a resource for search engine submission. In 
this case, you’ll need to create the <meta> tags that describe your site. You’ll explore some 
resources for search engine submission and optimization next. Promoting the Web site for 
the Lakeside Police Department is an important step toward getting people to use it.

script and any requirements for its use (such as posting a link to the provider’s Web 
site on your Web page).
 4. Start Notepad or your text editor and create an HTML document using the required 
document structure.
 5. Add an appropriate title to the HTML document using the <title> tags.
 6. Create a heading for the Web page and one or two paragraphs about the fundraiser

 8. Follow the instructions on the Web site you located in Step 2 to insert the script into 
the HTML document. Make sure that your page contains information required by the 
provider in exchange for your use of the script.
 9. Save the HTML document, and then open the file in a browser. Test the script. If nec-
essary, return to the HTML document to make changes.
 10. Return to the Web site you located in Step 2 and search for a script that creates a 
simple calculator that performs basic calculations. Add the script to your HTML 
document. In addition, add supporting text to indicate that the donor can use the 
calculator to compute the per-mile donation based on the mileage computed by 
the airport calculator. (For example, if the donation is 10 cents per mile, the donor 
would use the calculator to multiply the nautical mileage between airports by 10 
cents, or .10.)
 11. Save the HTML document, and then refresh the page in your Web browser. Use the 
airport calculator to compute the mileage between Denver, Colorado and Miami, 
Florida. Then use the calculator to compute the donation based on 10 cents per 
mile. (Note: If you are using Internet Explorer and a warning opens at the bottom of 
the window, click the Allow blocked content button to display the result of the script.

Buying and Selling over the Web
In its simplest form, the term “commerce” refers to the buying and selling of prod-
ucts, services, or something of value. Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, refers to 
the buying and selling of these products and services over the Internet and the Web. 
E-commerce, also referred to as etail, can be grouped into different sectors or categories 
based on who is involved in this exchange of goods and services. The Visual Overview 
for Session 9.1 describes four sectors into which e-commerce is commonly categorized.
All businesses—no matter where they are located and what they sell—try to gener-
ate revenues (income) and pay the costs associated with generating those revenues. The 
revenue model is the process or processes that a company uses to find new customers, 
make sales, and deliver the goods or services it sells. The most common revenue model 
is direct sales of products and services.
Businesses take a variety of approaches to generating revenue on the Web. These 
approaches include the use of online sales of goods and services, subscriptions, and 
direct fees. The chart in Figure 9-1 shows the dramatic rise of e-commerce retail sales 
in the United States from 1998 to 2010 as compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. Also, 
businesses use marketing strategies such as affiliate marketing and targeted advertis-
ing to generate revenue to support their online presence. Many companies also use 
a combined approach, such as charging direct fees for services or access to specific 
information as well as selling advertising and charging subscription fees for access 
to information. For more information about e-commerce, visit the links under the 
E-Commerce Information heading in the Additional Information section on the Weblinks 
page for Tutorial 9.
Steven wants to learn more about how Omega might use e-commerce. You’ll look at 
ways other companies are doing business over the Web.
Mobile e-commerce (or 
m-commerce) is when 
e-commerce takes place 
on a mobile device.

Tutorial 9 Electronic Commerce | Internet
Buying and Selling Goods 
The most common form of e-commerce is online retail, which refers to selling physical 
products on the Web. The items are located, reviewed, and purchased on the Web, and 
then shipped to the buyer. In effect, this is an updated form of buying from mail order 
catalogs. 
Companies have been selling goods through mail order catalogs since the late 
1800s. Probably the most notable of these are Sears and Montgomery Ward. Originally, 
potential customers received catalogs in the mail, placed their order by mail, and then 
received their items by mail. When the telephone became commonplace, these com-
panies began accepting telephone orders. In the mail order catalog model, the seller 
creates a brand image that conveys quality and a specific price point, and then uses the 
strength of that image to sell through its printed catalogs. Retailers that have success-
fully used mail order catalogs include sellers of consumer goods items such as clothes, 
computers, electronics, housewares, and gifts. Today’s online retail is based on this time-
tested mail order catalog model. 
In the online retail model, a company replaces or supplements its printed catalogs 
and/or brick-and-mortar store with a Web site. Customers can place orders through the 
Web site as well as by telephone, by mail, or in the store. In some stores, sales staff can 
place a Web order for a customer, or customers can use computers that are available for 
accessing the store’s Web site right in the physical store. Customers can also sometimes 
order an item on the Web site and then pick it up in a retail location near them. Some 
companies make certain products available only online and do not offer them for sale in 
their retail locations (or vice versa). 
Some companies, such as Amazon.com, CafePress, and Zappos.com, sell only on 
the Web. Individuals who have a specialty item to sell might also sell their items only 
on the Web, such as crafters of knitted goods, chicken coop designers, and musicians. 
These Web-only businesses are sometimes called dot-com or pure dot-com companies. 
However, most companies doing business on the Web today are not pure dot-com com-
panies, but instead use the Web to extend their existing businesses. 
Adding a Web site to reach potential customers creates an additional sales channel, 
which is a way that a company supplies its products or services to customers. Companies 
that use both a physical store and the Web to sell their products and services are some-
times referred to as bricks and clicks (combining “bricks” from the bricks and mortar 
of a traditional retail outlet and “clicks” from the action of selecting items on a Web 
page; sometimes called “clicks and mortar”). Brick-and-click companies abound—from 
national chain stores such as Target, Kohl’s, Toys“R”Us, OfficeMax, and Costco; to 
grocery stores such as Safeway, Whole Foods, and Albertsons; to manufacturers such as 
Hewlett-Packard and Apple; to banks and the U.S. Postal Service; to small, independent 
businesses such as baby clothing boutiques and comic book sellers.
 To learn more about online retailers, you will visit Web sites operated by different 
types of businesses.

oriented sites require a larger quantity purchase than consumer-oriented sites.
INSIGHT
Consumer Benefits and Drawbacks of Online Retail
Online retail has many benefits to consumers. You can shop at any time of the day or 
night. You can avoid crowds. It’s simple to compare prices for the same item at differ-
ent retailers. It can be easier to find items, particularly specialty items, by conducting 
a Web search. Many item listings include multiple images of the product that can be 
magnified to see greater detail and rotated to get additional views. In addition, a video 
demonstrating the product is often available. Reviews by media and other consumers 
are included, so you can get a quick overview of what other people liked and didn’t like 
about that item. For smaller businesses and niche businesses that can’t afford a store-
front or national ads to compete with established and large retailers, selling items online 
somewhat levels the playing field. 
There are also some drawbacks to online retail. You cannot see or hold the product 
to determine the quality or confirm that its color matches the color displayed on their 
monitor. Although people sometimes visit a brick-and-mortar store to evaluate the 
product but then purchase the item online when they can find it for a cheaper price. 
After purchasing an item, it can take up to a week to receive the item, depending on 
the shipping method selected. Also, the shipping often adds extra cost to the price. 
Finally, although you might find it convenient to view and purchase items on your 
computers or mobile devices, it can lead to more impulse purchases because you can 
purchase the item immediately without taking time to consider whether you really want 
that item.

Buying and Selling Subscriptions
Other businesses derive their revenue only from subscription fees. A subscription is an 
amount that users pay in order to access the site’s content. The subscription charge might 
be payable on a recurring basis such as monthly, or allow access during a specific time 
frame such as a year. This subscription-only model has been used successfully by some 
magazines that include no advertising as a matter of policy as well as some cable televi-
sion stations. 
Entertainment sites that feature online games, music, movies, and books are often 
subscription based. Netflix, one of the most popular subscription-only Web sites, offers 
movies and TV episodes that can be viewed on demand online as streaming video as do 
Amazon, Crackle, Hulu, Walmart.com, YouTube, and a host of other online companies. 
The fees range from monthly subscription fees for limited or unlimited access to pay-per-
view. In order to stream video, you need an Internet-connected device such as a gaming 
system, an HDTV, a smartphone, a tablet, or a streaming player. 
Many gaming sites such as GameHouse and EA Games and portal sites such as Yahoo! 
Games and MSN Games represent another example of subscription-based sites. They 
offer free online games to attract visitors as well as premium games that visitors must pay 
to play either by buying and downloading software to install on their computers, or by 
paying a subscription fee to enter the premium games area on the site.
However, it’s more common to see sites that charge a subscription fee as well as 
include advertising. Many newspaper and magazine sites use a combination of advertis-
ing and subscription revenue. These sites offer some content free of charge, but most of 
the content is available only to subscribers. For example, The Economist and The Wall 
Street Journal provide some free content on their Web sites (including article excerpts 
or summaries and classified ads) but charge a subscription fee to access the full articles 
and additional content. The Economist also publishes content in the subscriber section 
of its Web site before the printed magazine is delivered to subscribers or sold on news-
stands. Other newspapers, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the 
Los Angeles Times, offer most of their current stories free of charge on their Web sites but 
require visitors to pay for articles retrieved from their archives. 
Omega’s benefits, training, and compliance divisions all publish newsletters and 
reports of various types. Omega sends some of these publications to clients and potential 
clients at no charge. Other publications are sold for a flat fee or by subscription. Next, 
you will examine Web sites that employ combinations of subscription and advertising to 
support their revenue streams. 
To examine subscription sites:
◗	
1.	 On the Tutorial 9 Weblinks page for Session 9.1, click one of the links in the 
Subscription-Based Sites section. 
◗	
2.	 Explore the Web site to determine what types of content the site offers, the 
cost and terms for the subscription, and whether or not the site offers a free trial 
period. Also, determine if some of the site’s content is available without sub-
scribing. Figure 9-3 shows the home page for Angie’s List, a customer review 
service that is supported by membership subscription fees as well as business 
advertisements.
Many subscription-based 
Web sites also display ads 
to their subscribers.
Many subscription-based 
Web sites offer a free trial 
period so you can preview 
the site and then decide 
whether to join.

As you have seen, subscribers or advertisers (or both) pay to allow themselves or site 
visitors to access the content on a business’s Web site. Steven will explore the potential 
of using these options to sell some of Omega’s print publications. However, most of 
Omega’s revenue is generated by professional services provided to clients by its recruit-
ing and benefits divisions. Steven asks you to investigate Web sites that provide services 
for which they charge a fee.
Buying and Selling Services 
Some businesses offer services for which they charge a fee. The fee can be based on the 
specific service provided, or it can be based on the number or size of the transactions 
processed. Fees charged to consumers include brokerage fees, sales commissions, and 
the costs of information search and acquisition. A wide range of businesses on the Web 
use this service fees revenue model—from professional services such as tax planning and 
legal advice to intermediaries such as travel services and brokers.
Professional services sites charge fees for their services. For example, users can pre-
pare their tax returns online at the H&R Block or TurboTax sites. LegalShield offers legal 
services on its Web site. Individual law and accounting firms also offer various profes-
sional services on the Web. 
Another type of services sold on the Web is broker and intermediary services. An 
intermediary is a person or an organization that acts as a mediator or an agent between 
two parties to effect a transaction or an agreement. For example, when planning a vaca-
tion, you might use a travel agent to book your flight, reserve your hotel, and secure a 
rental car. In this case, the travel agent is the intermediary. Travel agents earn a commis-
sion on each airplane ticket, hotel reservation, auto rental, cruise, or vacation package 
that they book. In most cases, the transportation or lodging provider pays these com-
missions to the travel agent. Online travel sites such as Expedia and Travelocity also 
earn commissions from transportation and lodging providers in the form of fees for each 
reservation made through their Web site. 
Stock brokerage firms also typically charge fees for transactions. Customers pay a 
commission to the brokerage firm for each trade executed. Online brokers such as 
E*TRADE and TD Ameritrade are threatening traditional brokerage firms by offering trad-
ing over the Web with lower fees and commissions. In addition, customers can manage 
their trading accounts anytime, though transactions are posted only when the market 
is open. Other companies that offer intermediary or brokering services for a fee on the 
Web include event ticket agencies, mortgage lenders and brokers, banks, and insurance 
brokers.

INSIGHT
Disintermediation and Reintermediation
E-commerce has led to disintermediation in some markets, including the travel indus-
try, automotive sales, and stock brokerages. Disintermediation is when an intermedi-
ary from an industry, such as the traditional travel agencies, is no longer needed for 
the consumer to obtain the goods and services from the industry. In the case of travel 
agents, consumers began doing their own research and purchasing of airline tickets, 
hotels, and rental cars, often saving money in the process. In many cases, however, the 
original intermediary is replaced by a new liaison, who then receives the commission for 
providing information and facilitating the purchase of the transaction. The introduction 
of a new intermediary into an industry is called reintermediation. In the travel industry, 
the new intermediaries are the Web-based travel agencies such as Travelocity, Expedia, 
Priceline.com, Hotels.com, and Orbitz that specialize in finding and making available 
the best travel resources for consumers. 
The automotive sales industry has also encountered disintermediation. Traditionally, 
auto dealers buy cars from the manufacturer and sell them to consumers. They provide 
showrooms and salespeople to help customers learn about product features, arrange 
financing, and make a purchase decision. Autobytel.com, Cars.com, and other online 
firms specialize in locating dealers in the buyer’s area who are willing to sell cars for a 
small premium over the dealer’s nominal cost. The buyer can purchase the car from the 
dealer without negotiating its price with a salesperson. Autobytel charges participating 
dealers a fee for this service. Autobytel is disintermediating the salesperson and reinter-
mediating itself. The consumer spends less time buying the car and often pays a lower 
price while avoiding the negotiation process; the dealer pays a lower fee to Autobytel 
than the commission it would otherwise pay to its salesperson.
An auction is another example of an intermediary transaction. Auctions are an 
efficient way for businesses to clear out old and slow-moving inventory. In the past, 
companies would hire a liquidation broker to help dispose of unwanted inventory by 
holding an auction. A liquidation broker is an intermediary who matches sellers of 
obsolete inventory with purchasers who are looking for bargains. Liquidation brokers 
and companies that were large enough to arrange their own liquidation sales often found 
it expensive to set up a physical auction for obsolete inventory. The greatest expenses 
were leasing a place to hold the auction and mailing notices of the auction to a sufficient 
number of people to create a decent-sized bidding pool. It was also difficult to accu-
mulate a wide enough variety of items to attract bidders. Bidders who were interested 
in only one or two items would be reluctant to attend the auction. As a result, inventory 
sold this way seldom returned more than 10% of its cost. 
Today, many liquidation brokers are opening Web auctions to obtain a better range of 
bids. Auctions are a good way for sellers to obtain the highest possible price if the pool 
of bidders is large enough. An auction on a Web site can attract bidders from all over the 
world and these bidders can select the specific item on which they want to bid.
Most online auction sites offer merchandise that is the property of others, much as an 
auctioneer would at a public auction. The items being auctioned might be surplus inven-
tory, refurbished items, returns, discontinued items, packaging changes, and so forth. 
Each online auction site establishes its own bidding rules. Auctions can remain open 
for a few days or a week. Some sites are providing Webcasts so that bidders can attend 
a live auction via computer. Some sites provide automated software agents that bidders 
can instruct to place bids as needed to win the auction, subject to a maximum limit set 
by the bidder. Because bidders face a significant risk of buying a misrepresented product

Internet | Tutorial 9 Electronic Commerce
in a sight-unseen online auction, some auction sites offer mediation or escrow services 
that hold the buyer’s payment until he or she is satisfied that the item matches the seller’s 
description. Escrow services fees range from 1% to 10% of the item’s cost, with a mini-
mum fee of between $5 and $10. The advantages of conducting online auctions include 
a large pool of potential bidders, 24-hour access, and the ability to auction hundreds of 
similar items simultaneously. 
Some companies are too small to operate their own liquidation sites or to attract the 
interest of liquidation brokers. These companies have found eBay and similar consumer-
oriented auction sites to be useful tools for selling their excess inventory and used 
equipment. 
As you learned in Tutorial 4, eBay, one of the first auction Web sites, has become 
the premier choice for many people who want to participate in auctions. Both buyers 
and bidders benefit from the large marketplace that eBay has created. As discussed in 
Tutorial 4, sellers and buyers must register with eBay and agree to the site’s basic terms 
of doing business. Sellers pay a listing fee and a percentage of the final selling price. 
Buyers pay nothing to eBay. In addition to the basic fees, sellers can choose from a 
variety of enhanced and extra-cost services, including having their auctions listed in 
bold type or included as featured auctions that appear at the top of bidders’ search 
results pages. In an attempt to address bidder concerns about seller reliability, eBay 
identifies sellers who have received high ratings from buyers for excellent customer 
service with an eBay Top-rated seal. Also, if a buyer doesn’t receive the item purchased 
or believes that the received item is different from what was described in the listing, 
eBay Buyer Protection helps the buyers and sellers resolve the dispute.
These types of professional and intermediary services are similar to Omega’s offer-
ings. You will examine some of the different services provided on e-commerce sites next: 
professional services as well as broker and intermediary services.

Tax Services, on which the services and fees are described.
Online auctions are 
an example of C2C 
e-commerce because one 
person auctions an item 
to another person. They 
can also be considered 
B2C e-commerce even if 
a seller is not operating a 
formal business. 
Some sites require visitors 
to create an account and 
log in before subscription 
fees are disclosed.

Advertising and Marketing on the Internet
Through e-commerce, businesses use the Internet to establish an online marketplace 
and reach more potential customers. Whether they are selling products, subscriptions, 
or services on the Internet, businesses need to generate interest to effectively reach these 
potential customers. The Internet provides businesses the opportunity to promote their 
goods and services effectively and efficiently through advertising and marketing. 
Advertising
Many Web-based businesses rely on advertising to pay their costs. Advertising is a paid 
announcement that attracts attention to a product, service, business, person, or idea. 
The business or person who pays for the advertising is trying to influence an audience; 
for example, persuading a consumer to buy a company’s product. An ad that appears on 
a Web site is targeted toward that site’s visitors, who can usually access some or all of 
the site’s content for free. This model has been used successfully for television, broad-
cast, and print media. For example, television networks in the United States provide an 
audience with free programming that is interspersed with paid advertising messages. For 
Web-based businesses, some of the most common types of sites that support themselves 
with advertising are search engines, portals, and online newspapers and magazines.
The most successful advertising is directed at very specific audiences. The collection 
of characteristics that marketers use to group audiences is called demographic infor-
mation and includes such traits as address, age, gender, income, education, hobbies, 
political affiliation, and religion. Delivering ads to outlets with specific demographic 
characteristics is part of a strategy called target marketing. It can be difficult to determine 
whether a given Web site is attracting a specific market segment unless that site collects 
demographic information from its visitors. Although some visitors voluntarily supply 
this information as part of the process for registering and signing in to a site, others are 
becoming increasingly reluctant to provide this type of information because of privacy 
concerns and opt out of sharing this information.
As you have seen in previous tutorials, advertising appears in a variety of different 
forms on Web sites. Some are very obvious, such as banner ads and pop-ups. Others 
are less so, such as text ads or sponsored ads. Some of the more common types of ads 
include:
• Banner ads usually appear at the top of a Web page and combine text, images, 
animation, sound, and/or video to grab visitors’ attention as they open a Web page. 
These ads are often called display ads when they appear elsewhere on the Web page. 
Clicking the ad opens a link to the advertiser’s site. 
• Pop-up ads open in a new window or within the Web page as users browse a Web 
site and can contain text, graphics, animations, sound, and/or video. Browsers often 
include an option to block pop-up windows for users who prefer not to have these ads 
appear as they browse a Web page. These are also called floating ads, hover ads, slide-
in ads, or pop-under ads depending on how they pop-up in the Web page.

• Text ads are simple text-based links that appear within the body of a Web page and are 
related to the content. These are also sometimes called inline ads.
• Contextual ads change based on the content you are viewing or searching. They can 
be any type of ad, including banner ads, text ads, and pop-up ads. These are most 
commonly seen on the results pages of a search engine.
• Sponsorship ads are often a logo or simple statement that the content being viewed 
was paid for by a company. They often appear on a separate Sponsors page or area of 
the Web site.
• Video ads are ads in a video format that appear at the beginning of online videos such 
as newscasts, within a video, or on their own when browsing or viewing related con-
tent such as on YouTube. 
• Interstitial ads appear as visitors browse from one Web page to another and often con-
tain rich media, streaming video, or large graphics. These ads might appear when you 
click a link in an excerpt of a news story to view the entire story.
• Advertorials are paid editorial ads that contain objectively written opinions about a 
product or service.
• Classified ads are descriptions of items for sale such as a car, boat, motorcycle, house, 
or airplane, or something someone is looking for, such as a job. 
Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate marketing is an arrangement in which one company performs some business 
processes for another company in exchange for money or the sharing of expertise or 
access to customers. These arrangements can take many forms, such as when one com-
pany offers another company’s products for sale in return for a share of the revenue, or 
when one company receives a payment for generating a lead, referring a new member, 
or getting someone to request a catalog or sign up for a newsletter. Affiliate marketing 
can also be called a strategic alliance (or a strategic partnership). Amazon.com, Dell, 
PriceGrabber, and Upromise are just a few examples of companies that use affiliate mar-
keting in e-commerce.
Amazon has a variety of affiliate programs. When other Web sites and blogs suggest a 
book, they often include a link to the Amazon page for that book. Although the customer 
purchases the book directly through Amazon as usual, the site from which the customer 
linked to Amazon receives a small commission for helping to prompt the sale. Amazon 
also provides another affiliate program to companies such as Sears, Macy’s, and Lands’ 
End by allowing these companies to use Amazon as a sales channel for selling their 
products on the Web. 
PriceGrabber, a comparison shopping service site, provides another example of affili-
ate marketing. Shoppers can use the site to compare the cost of items for sale at different 
stores, both large, national chains and smaller, Web-only businesses. Depending on the 
program that merchants select, they pay PriceGrabber a fee whenever a shopper clicks 
a link to one of their product offers, which brings shoppers to the merchant’s Web site; 
or merchants pay PriceGrabber a commission (or a share of the revenue) whenever a 
shopper purchases an item from the PriceGrabber Web site. Other comparison shopping 
services include Buy.com, mySimon, Nextag, Pricewatch, and Shopzilla.
Upromise by Sallie Mae is a rewards program that provides members with a way to 
save money for college when shopping online, eating out, and purchasing groceries at 
participating retailers. These partner retailers, restaurants, and merchants are highlighted 
on the Upromise Web site, providing exposure to potential customers. These partners 
give a percentage of the total purchase price to the member’s Upromise account in 
exchange for the business. Family and friends can also make purchases linked to a mem-
ber’s account to contribute to the member’s savings. 
You’ll look at some affiliate marketing programs being used on the Web to see if 
there are any possibilities for Steve to incorporate this type of partnership with other 
companies.

Social Media Marketing
Social media marketing is the process of using social media Web sites such as 
Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to attract attention to an idea, product, Web site, 
store, and so forth. Because of its personal nature, social media leads to word-of-mouth 
advertising between consumers. Businesses are tapping into social media as a way 
to attract new customers, perform market research, and address consumer concerns. 
As a consumer, be aware that a blog, tweet, or Facebook page could be created by a 
business to influence you. It might not be as blatant as other ads, so the effect is more 
insidious. Also, because of the amount of personal information that individuals tend to 
disclose on social media, advertisements can be displayed that match closely with each 
person’s stated preferences.
Paying for E-Commerce Purchases
After selecting a product or service online, consumers need to pay for it. Although most 
e-commerce sites accept credit card payments, other forms of payment that are pro-
cessed in real time are available as well, including online payment services and digital 
wallets.
Consumers can use a digital wallet to pay for their e-commerce purchases. A digital 
wallet (also called an electronic wallet or e-wallet) is an electronic device with software 
(or software that runs on a computer or phone) that enables the user to make a purchase 
online. The digital wallet stores a user’s payment information such as bank account 
and credit card numbers, a digital certificate to identify the user, and information that 
the user provides such as shipping information to speed up Internet transactions. The 
consumer’s information is encrypted to protect against identity theft and other forms of 
online piracy. During checkout at an e-commerce site, the digital wallet can automati-
cally enter the user’s information in the online form after the user enters a password. 
These online payment services provide consumers with a way to make online purchases 
easily and securely. E-commerce sites process transactions through an online payment 
gateway, which connects to their credit card processing account and enable automated, 
secure, online transactions to occur.
Originally, digital wallets were stored only on the user’s computer. More often, mobile 
phones and other wireless devices are now used as digital wallets and stored on a server 
owned by a digital wallet vendor or an ISP. A digital wallet that an organization creates 
and maintains on its servers for consumers is sometimes called a thin wallet. A digital 
wallet vendor can charge a commission to a retailer on every purchase made with its 
wallet, or the merchant can pay a flat fee to the digital wallet vendor to use its wallets 
in transactions. Both the business and the consumer must use compatible digital wallets 
in order for the payment to be accepted. This is similar to how merchants choose which 
credit cards to accept for payment; for example, you cannot use an American Express 
card at a retailer that accepts only Visa and MasterCard.
Although digital wallets make e-commerce transactions easier, faster, and more 
secure, there are some things to consider before using one. Using a digital wallet enables 
a merchant to collect data about you and your shopping habits, including your name, 
address, gender, and age, as well as how many times you visit that merchant. Although 
this provides a quick way to verify the age of someone who is purchasing alcohol, for 
example, collecting personal data that can be sold to advertisers or used to attract adver-
tisers to a site benefits only the merchant or digital wallet vendor. 
Digital wallet transactions  
can occur online via a 
computer as well as in 
stores via a smartphone  
or other mobile device.

Making Payment Transactions with PayPal
As more business transactions occurred on the Internet, people needed a safe and 
secure way to send and receive payments. PayPal was created to address this need. 
Peter Thiel and Max Levchin developed the first digital wallet in 1998. Their original 
company, Fieldlink, enabled users to store encrypted information on their handheld 
devices such as Palm Pilots. They believed these digital wallets were safer than cash 
because they couldn’t be stolen. A year later, their company, then called Confinity, 
expanded on the concept to create PayPal, which allowed people to email payments. 
PayPal started to evolve into an online payment system. By 2000, eBay buyers and sell-
ers were requesting each other to use PayPal to send and receive payments. Two years 
later, in response, eBay acquired PayPal. Since then, PayPal has continued to develop 
more advanced online applications and services, implement enhanced security and 
fraud systems, and expand purchase protection to buyers and sellers while becoming 
a global company. PayPal promoted e-commerce and instigated growth because it 
provided a safe avenue for exchanging payments, which helped people to feel more 
comfortable when making purchases online. 
In addition to PayPal, other digital wallets include Google Wallet, V.me, Discover 
Money Messenger powered by PayPal, and Sprint Mobile Wallet. The Additional 
Information section of the Tutorial 9 Weblinks page includes links under the heading 
Digital Wallets that you can use to explore these sites.
The rise of mobile technology combined with near field communication technology 
means that more companies will be able to create smartphones that can act as digital 
wallets. Near field communication (NFC) is a standards-based, short-range wireless 
technology that allows electronic devices to interact over a couple of inches. NFC-
enabled smartphones include chips that can store all the information from a physical 
bank, credit cards, and identification cards, and then transmit the payment or ID data 
wirelessly over a short distance when the phone is close to a compatible receiver. NFC-
enabled smartphones are currently available through Sprint and AT&T; many others are 
expected to follow soon.
You’ll learn more about PayPal to see how Omega might use the global online pay-
ment company in its e-commerce activities.

Shipping Purchased Items
One major difference between shopping at a physical store and shopping online is 
when you have the item you purchased in hand. When shopping at a physical store, you 
usually take the item with you for immediate use. When shopping online, the item must 
be shipped to you. This adds time as well as cost to the purchase. Some sites charge 
separately for shipping, others include the cost in the purchase price, and some provide 
free shipping when the cost of your purchase exceeds a specific amount. In addition, 
shipping costs can be based on the number of items or the total weight of the shipment 
as well as the shipping service selected. Usually shipments can most inexpensively travel 
through the U.S. Postal Service with delivery occurring up to a week later. Faster options 
include two- or three-day shipping or overnight shipping, which all cost more. The 
major private shipping companies in the United States include FedEx, UPS, and DHL. 
Most successful small online businesses that sell products have inventory items with 
one common characteristic: a high value-to-weight ratio. The value-to-weight ratio is 
the price of the item divided by its weight. Large, heavy products that have a low price 
(for example, gravel, coal, or lumber) are difficult to sell online because the shipping 
costs exceed the profit on the item. Items that are small, light, and relatively expensive 
(such as jewelry, computer chips, or designer shoes) can be shipped at low cost and 
often generate enough profit to cover even next-day shipping costs. 
Consumer Concerns
E-commerce leads to two major concerns: transaction security and privacy. Potential 
customers of any business worry about the same issues; however, the virtual nature of an 
e-commerce site increases these concerns.
Transaction Security Concerns
Consumers often do not know who is operating a Web site from which they want to 
make a purchase. They might wonder whether the firm is a real company that will 
deliver the merchandise ordered. Or, they might want to know if the company will 
replace defective merchandise or refund the purchase price within a reasonable period. 
Online customers also want assurance that the payments they make for goods purchased 
over the Internet are secure. Potential customers are concerned about the security of 
their credit card numbers as those numbers travel over the Internet.

E-Commerce Customer Service 
When customers have a question or problem with an online purchase, how can they 
get the information or help they need? Brick-and-mortar stores usually have a customer 
service desk or sales staff that customers can turn to. Online stores and companies 
provide this help using the Internet communication technologies you learned about 
in earlier tutorials, including chat, texting, email, and FAQs pages. In addition, some 
online businesses provide a phone number that customers can call to talk directly with 
an employee or customer service agent, and others offer a callback service to have a 
staff member contact the customer. 
Privacy Concerns
Many potential customers of Web-based businesses are also concerned about their 
privacy. Web sites can collect a great deal of information about customers’ preferences, 
even before they place an order. By recording a user’s clickstream (a record of the links 
clicked by a user while visiting a Web site), the Web server can gather extensive knowl-
edge about that visitor and use it for marketing purposes, or share it with other compa-
nies without the customer’s knowledge. For example, many Web sites use clickstream 
information to display different banner ads to different visitors. Sites regularly use cook-
ies to store personal information about visitors. Cookies can speed up the login process 
for a returning visitor, but they also enable the site to provide targeted ads based on the 
personal information provided. 
A greater concern for many consumers is how e-commerce Web sites store their per-
sonal information. Many sites offer customers the option to store their credit card num-
bers so that customers do not have to type the card numbers every time they visit the site 
to buy something. Of course, the computer that stores these card numbers is connected 
(directly or indirectly) to the Internet. Any computer that is connected to the Internet is 
subject to attack from persons outside the company. There have been a number of widely 
reported cases in which an intruder has broken into an e-commerce site’s computer and 
stolen names, addresses, and credit card information. Sometimes these individuals have 
even posted the stolen credit card information on the Internet.
Because online businesses want to attract customers, it is in their best interest to 
ensure both transaction security and buyer privacy on their sites. To ensure that the trans-
actions conducted on their sites are secure, legitimate e-commerce Web sites use the SSL 
protocol to protect sensitive information as it travels over the Internet to and from their 
sites. Recall from Tutorial 6 that the SSL security protocol encrypts information flowing 
between a Web server and a Web client. When a Web site is using SSL, the site’s URL 
in the Location or Address bar begins with https:// instead of http:// and is highlighted in 
green or a padlock icon appears in the status bar. You can click the green bar or the pad-
lock icon to open a window with more information about the site’s security certification.
Several assurance providers have started offering various kinds of certifications for 
Web site transaction security and privacy policies. As you learned in Tutorial 6, an 
assurance provider is a third party that, for a fee paid by the e-commerce Web site, 
will certify that the site meets some criteria for conducting business in a secure and

privacy-preserving manner. Web sites can purchase these certifications and display the 
logo or seal of the assurance provider on the Web site for potential customers to exam-
ine before making any purchases. Most of these logos are hyperlinks to the assurance 
provider’s site, at which customers can find more information about the nature of the 
specific assurances given by that provider. Currently, the four major assurance providers 
are the Better Business Bureau (BBB), TRUSTe, Norton Secured Seal (formerly VeriSign), 
and WebTrust. 
No general standards currently exist in the United States for maintaining confiden-
tiality regarding clickstream information or general identifying information about Web 
site visitors and customers. However, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 
1998 (often referred to as COPPA) does make it illegal for Web sites to collect identifi-
able information from children under the age of 13 without first obtaining their parents’ 
consent. Many business Web sites include statements of privacy policy directed at con-
cerned customers, but no U.S. laws exist requiring such statements or policies.
You will look at the privacy statements for several e-commerce sites next.
To review privacy statements for e-commerce sites:
◗	
1.	 Return to the Tutorial 9 Weblinks page for Session 9.1, click one of the links in the 
Privacy Statements section, and then locate and read the privacy statement for 
that site. Notice the types of information the site collects and how that informa-
tion is collected and stored, what it uses that information for, and the methods 
the site uses to secure the information.

2.	 Repeat Step 1 for two more sites. 
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986, which was enacted 
before most people were using the Internet, does not include rules specifically designed 
to protect the privacy of persons using Web sites to conduct transactions. Many people 
and organizations believe the ECPA needs to be updated to reflect advances in technol-
ogy. For more information about the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the 
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, use the links in the Additional Information sec-
tion of the Tutorial 9 Weblinks page.

Decision Making: Evaluating E-Commerce Sites and Transactions
Shopping online involves making a series of decisions. Decision making is the process of 
choosing between possible alternatives. The choice made is the actual decision. Some of 
the decisions you need to make as an online consumer include the following:
1.	Should you purchase the item online or at a store? Consider things such as when you 
need the item, the selection available at a store versus online, how much the item costs, 
and the shipping costs and delivery time. Be sure you can wait for the item or are willing 
to pay more to have the item shipped overnight.
2.	From what site should you purchase the item? Before purchasing an item, compari-
son shop to determine the prices being charged by different etailers. You can do this 
by visiting different online vendors and by using comparison shopping sites such as 
Pricewatch and Buy.com.
3.	Is the site secure? Before you make a purchase, check the site for a logo from an assur-
ance provider such as BBB, TRUSTe, Norton Secured Seal (VeriSign), or WebTrust. See 
whether the site offers HTTPS (secure http) by checking whether its URL begins with 
https://. Find out what the site’s payment processes are, and select how you want to pay 
(credit card, digital wallet, etc.).
4.	What are your options if the item is not what you expected or doesn’t arrive? Check 
the business’s policies for returns and exchanges. See what protection plans it offers for 
shipping. You can also search the Web for customer reviews of the site.
If you take the time to evaluate a Web site and its policies, and research what others 
have to say about the merchant, your e-commerce experiences will be more positive.
International E-Commerce Issues
The Internet brings people together from every country in the world. E-commerce has 
an unprecedented geographic reach. When using a Web site to purchase products, 
subscriptions, or services, customers might be doing business with companies located 
anywhere around the globe. For example, customers in the United States might be doing 
business with a company in India, and vice versa. This international reach introduces 
special challenges for e-commerce.
Cultural and Language Issues
When visiting a Web site that originates in another country, you might see icons, phras-
ing, and colors that are different from what you’ve usually seen on other sites. This is 
because cultural conventions differ from country to country. Consider some examples: 
In the United States, people use a hand signal (the index finger touching the thumb to 
create a circle) that indicates “OK”; but in countries such as Brazil, this hand signal is an 
obscene gesture. In India, using the image of a cow in a cartoon or other comical setting 
is inappropriate. Customers in Muslim countries could be offended by an image that 
shows human arms or legs uncovered. Even colors or Web page design elements can be 
troublesome. For example, white denotes purity in Europe and the Americas, but is asso-
ciated with death and mourning in many Asian countries. A Web page that is divided 
into four segments could be offensive to a Japanese visitor because the number four is a 
symbol of death in that culture.

Also, although the predominant language on the Web is English, sites in other lan-
guages and in multiple languages are becoming more common. To address the language 
issue, many companies hire a translation firm to translate their existing Web pages into 
other languages. Human translators can make adjustments for local versions of a lan-
guage and can help ensure that the Web site is translated in a way that does not violate 
local customs. Translation that takes into account the culture and customs of the country 
is called localization. Once a business overcomes the language barrier, it can conduct 
e-commerce with any other business or consumer, anywhere in the world. 
For more information about the international challenges of e-commerce, visit the links 
under the International E-Commerce Issues heading in the Additional Information section 
of the Tutorial 9 Weblinks page.
Well-designed Web sites are accessible and effective for users no matter what country 
they are located in and what language they speak. To accomplish this, companies that 
have a large global presence often have each visitor specify his or her country of origin 
or language so that the next Web pages that appear reflect that customer’s geographic 
location and culture. Other companies create specific sites for each country in which 
they do business, such as Amazon.com, Disney, eBay, and Expedia. 
For example, Amazon has different sites for Canada (www.amazon.ca), China (www.
amazon.cn), France (www.amazon.fr), Germany (www.amazon.de), Italy (www.amazon.
it), Japan (www.amazon.co.jp), Spain (www.amazon.es), and the United Kingdom (www.
amazon.co.uk). Each site is customized to reflect the country it serves, using the appropri-
ate language, currency, icons, and phrasing for that country. For example, customers on the 
Amazon United Kingdom and Amazon Canada sites store their items in a “Basket” rather 
than a “Cart” as customers on the Amazon United States site do. This is because many 
Europeans use shopping baskets when they go to a store and might be unfamiliar with the 
term “shopping cart,” which is commonly used in the United States. 
You’ll look at how one company created different versions of its site to address the 
cultural and language issues. This will give Steve a good idea of how Omega might use 
different versions of its site to attract international customers for its new e-commerce 
ventures.

Legal Issues
Businesses that conduct e-commerce have the opportunity to participate in international 
commerce. Currency conversions, tariffs, import and export restrictions, local business 
customs, and the laws of each country in which a trading partner resides can each make 
international electronic commerce difficult. Many of the international issues that arise 
relate to legal, tax, and privacy concerns. Each country has the right to pass laws and 
levy taxes on businesses that operate within their jurisdictions. Countries that are mem-
bers of the European Community (EC), for example, have adopted very strict laws that 
limit the collection and use of personal information that companies gather in the course 
of doing business with consumers. U.S. companies that do business in the EC must com-
ply with these laws, which are much more restrictive than the laws in the United States. 
Within the United States, individual states and counties have the power to levy sales and 
use taxes on goods and services. In other countries, national sales and value-added taxes 
are imposed on an even more comprehensive list of business activities.
Complying with all of these laws and regulations can be difficult for small businesses 
that want to operate e-commerce Web sites. Therefore, many smaller sites restrict the 
countries to which they will deliver merchandise or in which they will provide services. 
These Web sites can place terms of service statements on their sites to protect themselves 
from laws and regulations of which they might be unaware. A terms of service (TOS) 
statement can include rules for site visitors and a statement of copyright interest in the 
site design and content, and can restrict the types of business that a visitor can conduct 
with the site. Most sites place their terms of service statements on a separate Web page 
and provide a link to it from the site’s home page. These links are typically titled “Terms 
of Service,” “Terms of Use,” “Conditions of Use,” “User Agreement,” or something simi-
lar. Figure 9-8 shows the TOU statement for Cengage Learning, the publisher of this book.

The combination of the Web’s interface and the Internet’s extension of computer net-
working has created new opportunities for e-commerce. Businesses that once sold retail 
goods to consumers through catalogs using mail or telephone orders now use the Web 
to make shopping more convenient. Other retailers, such as booksellers, can use large-
volume buying power to provide online shoppers with low prices and a wide variety of 
products. Information providers, such as newspapers, magazines, and newsletters, find 
that the Internet offers new ways to sell existing publications and platforms on which 
to deliver entirely new publications. Software manufacturers see that the Internet is an 
excellent vehicle for distributing new products, delivering upgrades to existing products, 
and providing low-cost support to users. The immediacy of the medium offers busi-
nesses, such as stockbrokers and travel agencies, an attractive way to interact with their 
customers.

Written Communication
Communicating Effectively in E-Commerce 
Written communication is the ability to convey information from one person to another 
in written form. The information exchange may involve any combination of thoughts, 
opinions, facts, or quantitative values with the intention to motivate, inform or influence 
behavior. This is especially important when communicating on the Internet, including 
planning and writing the content of Web pages, promotional ads, business plans, and 
security plans.
Communication Fundamentals
The fundamental model for all communication processes consists of three parts: sender, 
channel, and receiver. The sender creates the message to be transmitted, preparing it in 
the appropriate format and sending it along the communication channel. The channel 
is the mechanism along which the message travels, such as in an email message or on a 
Web page. The receiver accepts the message, decodes and understands the message, and 
offers feedback, as needed, to the sender. Along the way, noise may interfere with the 
transmission and receipt of communications. For example, the sender’s message might 
be unclear, such as a poorly written Web page. 
Strategies for Effective Written Communication 
Precision writing is important, especially in electronic documents such as Web pages, 
email, and text messages because they are often copied or forwarded to people you 
won’t know, and who won’t know the circumstances under which you wrote your com-
munication. Also, most recipients of business communications are busy, and will take 
time to read only what is important and relevant to them at that moment. This means you 
must be succinct and to the point to effectively convey your message. Keep in mind the 
following strategies as you formulate your business communication:
• Know your audience. Who will read what you write? What knowledge do they 
already possess, and what attitudes might they have about your subject?
• Determine the purpose of your writing. Are you writing to inform, or do you want 
action to be taken? Do you hope to change a belief or simply state your position?
• Research your topic. Provide all the necessary information the receiver will need 
to make a decision or take action. If facts are included, be sure you can substanti-
ate them.
• Use proper grammar and spelling. Most word processing programs and email pro-
grams provide tools for checking spelling and grammar. Keep in mind that spell-
checking doesn’t catch every error, so be sure to review your work carefully.
• Consider the tone and language. In formal documents, such as a business Web site, 
carefully consider the “tone” of your written communication so you don’t uninten-
tionally offend your readers. Using contractions is usually acceptable, but it is never 
acceptable to use offensive language. A friendly tone is usually welcome in the 
workplace, as is a positive one, but be careful not to be overly familiar. 
• Rewrite or revise as needed. Have someone else read the final content so you can 
determine whether your meaning is clear.

Plan and Create an eBay Listing 
The practice of buying and selling items online has remained popular with e-commerce 
sites such as eBay. Effective written communication is very important to eBay sellers 
because they will almost exclusively interact with potential buyers through written com-
munication. In this exercise, you will use the skills presented in Tutorials 5 through 9 to 
research how to become an eBay seller. You will locate and document how to create a 
seller’s account and set up a listing. You will also determine how to best convey in writ-
ing the information potential buyers will need to know about the item and your selling 
policies. Additionally, you will select a wireless device for checking your listing while 
away from home, and communicating effectively with potential buyers. You will then 
prepare a report that documents your findings and includes a fictional listing that clearly 
communicates the relevant information to buyers.
Note: Please be sure not to include any personal information of a sensitive nature in the 
documents you create to be submitted to your instructor for this exercise. Later on, you 
can update the documents with such information for your own personal use.
 1. Start your Web browser, and go to the eBay site. Explore the site to research how 
to become an eBay seller, the difference between being an eBay seller and an eBay 
business seller, and which type of seller you would want to be. Find out how to cre-
ate an account to become an eBay seller or an eBay business seller. 
 2. Select an item that you might want to sell on eBay. Search for similar items on eBay 
and review at least two listings you find. 
 3. Evaluate the different types of listing formats and determine which format is best to 
use for selling your item. What information will you include about the item in the 
listing? Will you include photographs to show the item; if so, how many? Create a 
storyboard that shows how the information in your listing will be organized.
 4. Consider the possible shipping methods and costs and select an appropriate method. 
How do you determine the shipping costs? Who will pay the shipping costs? How 
will you communicate the shipping method and cost to potential buyers? What can 
you do to ensure that the item reaches its destination and avoid possible disputes 
with the buyer? 
 5. Assess the different payment methods. What are the advantages and disadvantages 
of each method? Is each method safe and secure for both you and the buyer? Which 
method seems most secure? Which payment method(s) will you offer in your listing, 
and why? How will you communicate the payment method you select to potential 
buyers? 
 6. Determine your return policy. Do you need to include a return policy? Must you 
accept returns? Who will pay the return shipping costs? How will you communicate 
your return policy to potential buyers?
 7. Research how you can communicate with potential buyers on eBay. What are some 
guidelines you can follow in your interactions with potential buyers? What types of 
communication does eBay’s member-to-member contact policy prohibit and allow? 
Why does eBay have such a policy?

evaluate each other and decide whether to do business together? Can you block a 
particular buyer from bidding on your listing? If so, how? 
 9. Prepare a fictional listing that you might place on eBay to sell the item you selected. 
The listing should include the format you selected, specific information about the 
item, the shipping method(s) and cost, the payment options, the return policy, and 
any other details you believe would help make the item you want to sell appeal to 
potential buyers. 
 10. Research a wireless device that you could use to check your postings and auctions 
while not at home. In your report, document the device you selected, and explain 
why you selected it.

Computer Networks
Computers that are connected to each other form a network. Each computer on a 
network uses a network interface card to create the network connection. A network 
interface card (often called a NIC or simply a network card) is a circuit board card or 
other device used to connect a computer to a network of other computers. Most com-
puters and mobile devices have a network card built into them; for older devices, you 
might need to install a network card to connect the device to a network. These cards are 
connected to servers using cables or wireless signals. A server is a general term for any 
computer that accepts requests from other computers that are connected to it and shares 
some or all of its resources, such as printers, files, or programs, with those computers.
A server runs software that coordinates the information flow among the other com-
puters in the network, which are called clients. The software that runs on the server is 
called a network operating system. Connecting computers this way, in which one server 
computer shares its resources with multiple client computers, is called a client/server 
network. Client/server networks commonly are used to connect devices in a local area 
network (LAN), which is a network configuration in which devices that are located in 
close proximity to each other, such as in a home or small business, are connected to 
each other. Figure A-1 shows a typical client/server LAN.
Each computer, printer, or other device attached to a network is called a node or 
network node. The server can be a personal computer (PC) or a larger, more powerful 
computer. Most of these larger computers are called “servers” to distinguish them from 
desktop or laptop computers. Companies that need substantial computing power to run 
their applications and manage their businesses often connect hundreds or even thou-
sands of large PCs together to act as servers.

Appendix A The Internet and the World Wide Web | Internet
Like any computer, servers have operating systems; however, they also can run net-
work operating system software. Although network operating system software can be 
more expensive than the operating system software for a stand-alone computer, having 
computers connected in a client/server network can provide cost savings. For example, 
by connecting each client computer to a server, all of the computers can share the 
server-installed network printer and the media used for creating computer backups.
Most personal computer operating systems, including current versions of Microsoft 
Windows and Macintosh operating systems, have built-in networking capabilities. Also, 
some personal computer operating systems that can serve as network operating systems, 
such as Linux, are available on the Internet and can be downloaded and used at no cost.
Connecting Computers to a Network
Not all LANs use the same kind of cables to connect their computers. The oldest cable 
type is called twisted pair cable, which telephone companies have used for years to wire 
residences and businesses. Twisted pair cable has two or more insulated copper wires 
that are twisted around each other and are enclosed in another layer of plastic insula-
tion. A wire that carries an electric current generates an electromagnetic field around 
itself. This electromagnetic field can induce a small flow of electricity in nearby objects, 
including other wires. This induced flow of unwanted electricity is called electrical 
interference. In twisted pair wiring, the wires are twisted because wrapping the two 
wires around each other reduces the amount of electrical interference that each wire in 
the pair might pick up from other nearby current-carrying wires. The type of twisted pair 
cable that telephone companies have used for years to transmit voice signals is called 
Category 1 cable. Category 1 cable transmits information more slowly than the other 
cable types, but it is also much less expensive.
Coaxial cable is an insulated copper wire encased in a metal shield that is enclosed 
in plastic insulation. The signal-carrying wire is completely surrounded by the metal 
shield, so it resists electrical interference much better than twisted pair cable. Coaxial 
cable also carries signals about 20 times faster than Category 1 twisted pair; however, it 
is considerably more expensive. Because coaxial cable is thicker and less flexible than 
twisted pair, it is harder for installation workers to handle and thus is more expensive to 
install. You probably have seen coaxial cable because it is used for most cable television 
connections. You might hear this type of cable called “coax” (pronounced “koh-axe”) by 
network technicians.
Over time, cable manufacturers have developed better versions of twisted pair cable. 
The current standards for twisted pair cable used in computer networks are Category 5, 
Category 5e, Category 6, and Category 7 cable. Category 5 cable carries signals between 
10 and 100 times faster than coaxial cable and is just as easy to install as Category 1 cable. 
Category 5e cable (the “e” stands for “enhanced”), Category 6 cable, and Category 7 
cable are three newer versions of twisted pair cable that look exactly like Category 5 cable, 
but are constructed of higher quality materials so they can carry more signals up to 10 
to 100 times faster than Category 1 cable. Many businesses and schools have Category 5 
cable installed, but they are replacing it with Category 5e, Category 6, or Category 7 cable 
as they upgrade their network hardware to handle the highest LAN speeds available today. 
You might hear these cable types called “Cat-5,” “Cat-6,” or “Cat-7” cable by network 
technicians.

The most expensive cable type is fiber-optic cable, which does not use an electrical 
signal at all. Fiber-optic cable (sometimes called “fiber” by network technicians) trans-
mits information by using lasers to pulse beams of light through very thin strands of glass. 
Fiber-optic cable transmits signals much faster than either coaxial cable or any category 
of twisted pair cable. Because it does not use electricity, fiber-optic cable is completely 
immune to electrical interference. Fiber-optic cable is lighter and more durable than 
coaxial cable, but it is harder to work with and more expensive than either coaxial cable 
or Category 5 or higher twisted pair cable. The price of fiber-optic cable and the laser 
sending and receiving equipment needed at each end of the cable has dropped dramati-
cally over time. Thus, companies are using fiber-optic cable in more networks as the cost 
becomes more affordable; however, its main use today remains connecting networks to 
each other rather than as part of the networks themselves. Figure A-2 shows these three 
types of cable.
Perhaps the most liberating way to connect computers in a LAN is to avoid using 
cables completely. Wireless networks use wireless transmitters and receivers that plug 
into or replace network cards to connect devices to a network without using cables. 
Wireless LANs are used to provide network services in many types of buildings, on 
school campuses, in retail outlets, and in homes and businesses. Figure A-3 shows the 
physical layout of a small wireless network that might be useful in a small office or a 
home. Connected to the wireless network are two desktop computers, two laptop com-
puters, a shared printer, and two mobile devices. The only cable used in this configura-
tion is the one that connects the wireless router to the Internet connection.

All of these connection types—twisted pair, Category 1, coaxial, Category 5, 
Category 5e, Category 6, Category 7, fiber-optic, and wireless—are options for creat-
ing LANs. These LANs can, in turn, be connected to the Internet or to other, larger 
networks.
Understanding IP Addresses and Domain Names 
Each computer on the Internet has a unique identification number, called an IP (Internet 
Protocol) address. IP addressing uses a unique number, such as 192.168.0.1, to identify 
each computer on the Web. Most people, however, do not use an IP address to locate a 
Web site. Instead, they use a domain name.
IP Addressing
Until 2011, the IP addressing system used on the Internet was called IP version 4 (IPv4). 
IPv4 uses a 32-bit number to label each address on the Internet. The 32-bit IP address is 
usually written in four 8-bit parts. In most computer applications, an 8-bit number is called 
a byte; however, in networking applications, an 8-bit number is often called an octet. 
In the binary (base 2) numbering system, an octet can have values from 00000000 
to 111111111; the decimal equivalents of these binary numbers are 0 and 255, respec-
tively. Each part of a 32-bit IP address is separated from the previous part by a period, 
such as 106.29.242.17. You might hear a person pronounce this address as “one hun-
dred six dot twenty-nine dot two four two dot seventeen.” This notation is often called 
dotted decimal notation. The combination of these four parts provides 4.2 billion pos-
sible addresses (256 3 256 3 256 3 256). Because each of the four parts of a dotted 
decimal number can range from 0 to 255, IP addresses range from 0.0.0.0 (which would 
be written in binary as 32 zeros) to 255.255.255.255 (which would be written in binary 
as 32 ones).

In the mid-1990s, the accelerating growth of the Internet created concern that the 
world could run out of IP addresses within a few years. Originally, the 4.2 billion 
addresses provided by the IPv4 rules seemed sufficient for an experimental research 
network. However, by 2011, the supply of IP addresses was gone.
The IETF worked on several new protocols that could solve the limited addressing 
capacity of IPv4 and, in 1997, approved IP version 6 (IPv6) as the protocol that would 
replace IPv4. The new IP version was implemented gradually over a 20-year period 
because the two protocols are not directly compatible. However, network engineers 
have devised ways to run both protocols together on interconnected networks. The major 
advantage of IPv6 is that the number of addresses is more than a billion times larger than 
the 4.2 billion addresses available in IPv4. 
Domain Names
A domain name is a unique name associated with a specific IP address by a program that 
runs on an Internet host computer. This program, which coordinates the IP addresses and 
domain names for all computers attached to it, is called DNS (Domain Name System) 
software, and the host computer that runs this software is called a domain name server. 
For example, the domain name “cengage.com” is the computer connected to the Internet 
for Cengage Learning, which is a commercial institution (.com). No other computer on 
the Internet has this same domain name.
Domain names have a hierarchical structure that you can follow from top to bottom as 
you read the domain names from right to left. The last part of a domain name is called its 
top-level domain (TLD). For example, DNS software on the Internet host computer that is 
responsible for the .com domain keeps track of the IP addresses for all of the institutions 
in its domain, including “cengage.” Similar DNS software on the “cengage” Internet host 
computer would keep track of the company’s other computers in its domain.
Since 1998, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) 
has been responsible for managing domain names. In the 1980s, six TLDs were created 
(.com, .edu, .gov, .mil, .net, and .org). Domains registered using the .com, .net, and .org 
TLDs have no restrictions; however, domain names that use the .edu, .gov, and .mil TLDs 
are restricted to certain types of organizations and for limited purposes.
In addition to these original TLDs, ICANN created and manages additional TLDs, 
called general TLDs (gTLDs), to expand the number of TLDs. Some of the gTLDs include 
ones for specific countries, such as .us, which is approved for general use by any person 
or organization within the United States. However, the .us domain is most frequently 
used by state and local government organizations in the United States and by U.S. 
primary and secondary schools (because the .edu domain is reserved for post-secondary 
educational institutions). Internet host computers outside the United States often use 
two-letter country domain names instead of, or in addition to, the six general TLDs. For 
example, the domain name uq.edu.au is for The University of Queensland (uq), which is 
an educational institution (.edu) in Australia (.au).
The four gTLDs introduced in 2000 included .biz (for business organizations), .info 
(for an informational Web site created by an individual or organization), .name (for 
individuals), and .pro (for licensed professionals, such as accountants, lawyers, and 
physicians).
ICANN also created other TLDs, called sponsored TLDs (sTLDs), which are main-
tained by a sponsoring organization other than ICANN. The three sTLDs introduced in 
2000 that are sponsored by various industry organizations are .aero (for airlines, airports, 
and the air transport industry), .coop (for cooperative organizations), and .museum (for 
museums). Each of these domains is maintained by its sponsoring organization, not by 
ICANN. For example, the .aero domain is maintained by SITA, an air transport industry 
association.
Figure A-4 shows a list of the original TLDs, and some of the country and general 
TLDs you’ll find today.

Origins of the Internet
In the early 1960s, the U.S. Department of Defense undertook a major research project. 
Because this was a military project and was authorized as a part of national security, 
the true motivations are not known with certainty; but most people close to the project 
believe it arose from the government’s concerns about the possible effects of nuclear 
attack on military computing facilities. The Department of Defense realized that the 
weapons of the future would require powerful computers for coordination and con-
trol. The powerful computers of that time were all large mainframe computers, so the 
Department of Defense began examining ways to connect these computers to each other 
and to weapons installations that were distributed all over the world.
The agency charged with this task was the Advanced Research Projects Agency 
(ARPA). During its lifetime, this agency has used two acronyms: ARPA and DARPA. 
This book uses its current acronym: DARPA, for Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency. DARPA hired many of the best communications technology researchers, and 
for many years funded research at leading universities and institutes to explore the task 
of creating a worldwide network of computers. A photo of these dedicated computer 
networking pioneers appears in Figure A-5.

DARPA researchers soon became concerned about computer networks’ vulnerability 
to attack because networks at that time relied on a single, central control function. If the 
network’s central control point was damaged or attacked, the network would be unus-
able. Consequently, they worked hard to devise ways to eliminate the need for network 
communications to rely on a central control function.
Connectivity: Circuit Switching vs. Packet Switching
One of the first networking-related topics to be researched by the DARPA scientists was 
connectivity, or methods of sending messages over networks. The first computer networks 
were created in the 1950s. The models for those early networks were the telephone com-
panies because most early wide area networks (WANs) used leased telephone company 
lines to connect computers to each other. In telephone company systems of that time, a 
telephone call established a single connection between sender and receiver. Once the 
connection was established, all data then traveled along that single path. The telephone 
company’s central switching system selected specific telephone lines, or circuits, that 
would be connected to create the single path. This centrally controlled, single-connection 
method is called circuit switching. 
Although circuit switching is efficient and economical, it relies on a central point of 
control and a series of connections that form a single path. This makes circuit-switched 
communications vulnerable to the destruction of the central control point or any link in 
the series of connections that make up the single path that carries the signal.
Packet switching is an alternative means for sending messages. In a packet-switching 
network, files and messages are broken down into packets that are labeled electroni-
cally with codes for their origin and destination. The packets travel from computer to

computer along the network until they reach their destination. The destination computer 
collects the packets and reassembles the original data from the pieces in each packet. 
Each computer that an individual packet encounters on its trip through the network 
determines the best way to move the packet forward to its destination. 
Computers and other devices that perform this function on networks are often called 
routing computers, or routers, and the programs they use to determine the best path 
for packets are called routing algorithms. Thus, packet-switched networks are inher-
ently more reliable than circuit-switched networks because they rely on multiple routers 
instead of a central point of control, and because each router can send individual pack-
ets along different paths if parts of the network are not operating.
By 1967, DARPA researchers had published their plan for a packet-switching network; 
and in 1969, they connected the first computer switches at four locations: the University 
of California at Los Angeles, SRI International, the University of California at Santa 
Barbara, and the University of Utah. This experimental WAN was called the ARPANET.
The ARPANET grew over the next three years to include more than 20 computers. The 
ARPANET used the Network Control Protocol (NCP) to enable each of those computers 
to communicate with other computers on the network. A protocol is a collection of rules 
for formatting, ordering, and error-checking data sent across a network.
Open Architecture Philosophy
As more researchers connected their computers and computer networks to the ARPANET, 
interest in the network grew in the academic community. One reason for increased inter-
est in the project was its adherence to an open architecture philosophy; that is, each net-
work could continue using its own protocols and data-transmission methods internally. 
The open architecture philosophy includes four key points:
• Independent networks should not require any internal changes to be connected to the 
Internet.
• Packets that do not arrive at their destinations must be retransmitted from their source 
network.
• Router computers do not retain information about the packets they handle.
• No global control will exist over the network.

Internet | Appendix A The Internet and the World Wide Web
This open architecture philosophy was revolutionary at the time. Most companies that 
built computer networking products at that time, including IBM and Digital Equipment 
Corporation, put considerable effort into making their networks incompatible with other 
networks. These manufacturers believed that they could lock out competitors by not 
making their products easy to connect with products made by other companies. The shift 
to an open architecture approach is what made the Internet of today possible.
In the early 1970s, Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn developed a set of protocols that 
implemented the open architecture philosophy better than the NCP. These new proto-
cols were the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol, which usually 
are referred to by their combined acronym, TCP/IP. TCP includes rules that computers 
on a network use to establish and break connections; IP includes rules for routing of 
individual data packets. TCP/IP continues to be used today in LANs and on the Internet. 
The term “Internet” was first used in an article about TCP written by Cerf and Kahn in 
1974. The importance of TCP/IP in the history of the Internet is so great that many people 
consider Vinton Cerf to be the father of the Internet.
A number of TCP/IP-based networks—independent of the ARPANET—were created 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the 
Computer Science Network (CSNET) for educational and research institutions that did 
not have access to the ARPANET. The City University of New York started a network of 
IBM mainframes at universities called the Because It’s Time (originally, “Because It’s 
There”) Network (BITNET).
New Uses for Networks
Although the goals of the ARPANET were still to control weapons systems and transfer 
research files, other uses for this vast network began to appear in the early 1970s. In 1972, 
an ARPANET researcher named Ray Tomlinson wrote a program that could send and 
receive messages over the network. Email had been born and rapidly became widely used 
in the computer research community. In 1976, the Queen of England sent an email mes-
sage over the ARPANET. The ARPANET continued to develop faster and more effective net-
work technologies; for example, the ARPANET began sending packets by satellite in 1976.
By 1981, the ARPANET had expanded to include more than 200 networks. The 
number of individuals in the military and education research communities who used the 
network continued to grow. Many of these new participants used the networking tech-
nology to transfer files and access computers remotely. The TCP/IP suite included two 
tools for performing these tasks. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) enabled users to transfer 
files between computers, and Telnet let users log in to their computer accounts from 
remote sites. The first mailing lists also appeared on these networks. A mailing list is an 
email address that takes any message it receives and forwards it to any user who has 
subscribed to the list.
Although file transfer and remote login were attractive features of these new TCP/IP 
networks, their improved email and other communications facilities attracted many users 
in the education and research communities. Mailing lists (such as BITNET’s LISTSERV), 
information posting areas (such as the User’s News Network, or Usenet newsgroups), 
and adventure games were among the new applications appearing on the ARPANET.
Although the people using these networks were developing many creative applica-
tions, relatively few people had access to the networks. Most of these people were mem-
bers of the research and academic communities. From 1979 to 1989, these new and 
interesting network applications were improved and tested with an increasing number of 
users. TCP/IP became more widely used as academic and research institutions realized 
the benefits of having a common communications network. The explosion of PC use dur-
ing that time also helped more people become comfortable with computing.

Interconnecting the Networks
The early 1980s saw continued growth in the ARPANET and other networks. The Joint 
Academic Network (JANET) was established in the United Kingdom to link universities 
there. Traffic increased on all of these networks; and in 1984, the Department of Defense 
split the ARPANET into two specialized networks: The ARPANET would continue its 
advanced research activities, and the MILNET (for Military Network) would be reserved 
for military uses that required greater security.
By 1987, congestion on the ARPANET caused by a rapidly increasing number of 
users on the limited-capacity leased telephone lines was becoming severe. To reduce 
the traffic load on the ARPANET, a network run by the NSF, called NSFNET, merged with 
another NSF network, called CSNET, and with BITNET to form one network that could 
carry much of the network traffic that had been carried by the ARPANET. The result-
ing NSFNET awarded a contract to Merit Network, Inc., IBM, Sprint, and the state of 
Michigan to upgrade and operate the main NSFNET backbone. 
A network backbone includes the long-distance lines and supporting technology that 
transport large amounts of data between major network nodes. By the late 1980s, many 
other TCP/IP networks had merged or established interconnections. Figure A-6 sum-
marizes how the individual networks described in this section combined to become the 
Internet as it is known today.

Network Use in Business
As PCs became more powerful, affordable, and readily available during the 1980s, com-
panies increasingly used them to construct LANs. Although these LANs included email 
software that employees could use to send messages to each other, businesses wanted 
their employees to be able to communicate with people outside their corporate LANs. 
The NSF prohibited commercial network traffic on the networks it funded, so businesses 
turned to commercial email services. Larger firms built their own TCP/IP-based WANs 
(wide area networks) that used leased telephone lines to connect field offices to corpo-
rate headquarters. 
Today, people use the term intranet to describe LANs or WANs that use TCP/IP but do 
not connect to sites outside a single organization. Although most companies allow only 
their employees to use the company intranet, some companies give specific outsiders—
such as customers, vendors, or business partners—access to their intranets. These outside 
parties agree to respect the confidentiality of the information on the network. An intranet 
that allows selected outside parties to connect is often called an extranet.
In 1989, the NSF permitted two commercial email services—MCI Mail and 
CompuServe—to establish limited connections to the Internet that allowed their com-
mercial subscribers to exchange email messages with the members of the academic and 
research communities who were connected to the Internet. These connections allowed 
commercial enterprises to send email directly to Internet addresses, and allowed mem-
bers of the research and education communities on the Internet to send email directly to 
MCI Mail and CompuServe addresses. The NSF justified this limited commercial use of 
the Internet as a service that would primarily benefit the Internet’s noncommercial users.
People from all walks of life—not just scientists and academic researchers—started 
thinking of these networks as a global resource that we now know as the Internet. 
Information systems professionals began to form volunteer groups such as the Internet 
Engineering Task Force (IETF), which first met in 1986. The IETF is a self-organized group 
that makes technical contributions to the engineering of the Internet and its technologies. 
The IETF is the main body that develops new Internet standards.
Although the network of networks that is now known as the Internet had grown from 
four computers on the ARPANET in 1969 to more than 300,000 computers on many 
interconnected networks by 1990, the greatest growth in the Internet was yet to come. 
Growth of the Internet
A formal definition of the term “Internet,” which was adopted in 1995 by the Federal 
Networking Council (FNC), appears in Figure A-7.

The researchers who had been so involved in the creation and growth of the Internet 
accepted it as part of their working environment, but people outside the research commu-
nity were largely unaware of the potential offered by a large interconnected set of com-
puter networks until the 1990s. Realizing that the Internet was becoming much more than 
a scientific research project, the U.S. Department of Defense finally closed the research 
portion of its network, the ARPANET, in 1995. The NSF also wanted to turn over the 
Internet to others so it could return its attention and funds to other research projects.
The process of shutting down the ARPANET and privatizing the Internet began in 
1991, when the NSF eased its restrictions on Internet commercial activity. Businesses 
and individuals continued to connect to the Internet in ever-increasing numbers. 
Although nobody really knows how big the Internet is, one commonly used measure is 
the number of Internet hosts. An Internet host is a computer that connects a LAN or a 
WAN to the Internet. Each Internet host might have any number of computers connected 
to it. Figure A-8 shows the rapid growth in the number of Internet host computers. As you 
can see, the growth has been dramatic.
RESOLUTION: The Federal Networking Council (FNC) agrees that the following
language reflects our definition of the term “Internet”
“Internet” refers to the global information system that—
(i) is logically linked together by a globally unique address space based on the Internet 
Protocol (IP) or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons;
(ii) is able to support communications using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet 
Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons; and/or other IP-compatible 
protocols; and
(iii) provides, uses or makes accessible, either publicly or privately, high level services 
layered on the communications and related infrastructure described herein.

The numbers in Figure A-8 probably underestimate the true growth of the Internet 
in recent years for two reasons. First, the number of hosts connected to the Internet 
includes only those computers that are directly connected to the Internet. In other 
words, if a LAN with 100 PCs is connected to the Internet through only one host com-
puter, those 100 computers appear as one host in the count. Because the number and 
size of LANs have increased in recent years, the host count probably underestimates 
the growth in the number of all computers that have access to the Internet. Millions of 
mobile devices have features that allow them to connect to the Internet. These devices 
are connected through a relatively small number of Internet hosts at their wireless service 
providers, which is another reason why the number of devices connected to the Internet 
is probably underestimated. 
Second, the number of computers is only one measure of growth. Internet traffic now 
carries more files that contain graphics, sound, and video, so Internet files have become 
larger. A given number of users sending video clips will use much more of the Internet’s 
capacity than the same number of users will use by sending email messages or text files. 
No one knows how many individual email messages or files travel on the Internet, 
and no one really knows how many people use the Internet today because the Internet 
has no central management or coordination, and the routing computers do not retain 
copies of the packets they handle. However, some companies and research organiza-
tions estimate the number of regular Internet users today to be nearly 2 billion. 
The opening of the Internet to business enterprise helped increase its growth dramati-
cally; however, another development worked hand in hand with the commercializa-
tion of the Internet to spur its growth. That development was the technological advance 
known as the World Wide Web.

The Evolution of the Web
Two important innovations played key roles in making the Internet easier to use and 
more accessible to people who were not research scientists. The first innovation, hyper-
text, connected the content stored on the networks and made that content more acces-
sible. The second innovation was the Web browser itself, which provided users with a 
tool that made it possible to find and access that content. 
Origins of Hypertext
In 1945, Vannevar Bush, who was the director of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research 
and Development, wrote an Atlantic Monthly article about ways that scientists could 
apply to peacetime activities the skills they learned during World War II. The article 
included a number of visionary ideas about future uses of technology to organize and 
facilitate efficient access to information. Bush speculated that engineers eventually 
would build a machine that he called the Memex, a memory extension device that 
would store all of a person’s books, records, letters, and research results on microfilm. 
Bush’s Memex would include mechanical aids to help users consult their collected 
knowledge fast and in a wide variety of ways. 
In the 1960s, Ted Nelson described a similar system in which text on one page links to 
text on other pages. Nelson called his page-linking system hypertext. Douglas Engelbart, 
who also invented the computer mouse, created the first experimental hypertext system 
on one of the large computers of the 1960s. In 1976, Nelson published a book, Dream 
Machines, in which he outlined project Xanadu, a global system for online hypertext 
publishing and commerce. Figure A-9 includes photos of Bush, Nelson, and Engelbart—
three forward-looking thinkers whose ideas laid the foundation for the Web.
In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau were working at CERN—the European 
Laboratory for Particle Physics. Berners-Lee and Cailliau were trying to improve the 
laboratory’s research document-handling procedures. CERN had been using the Internet 
for two years to circulate its scientific papers and data among the high-energy phys-
ics research community throughout the world; however, the Internet did not help the 
agency display the complex graphics that were important parts of its theoretical models. 
Independently, Berners-Lee and Cailliau each proposed a hypertext development project 
to improve CERN’s document-handling capabilities.
Over the next two years, Berners-Lee developed the code for a hypertext server pro-
gram and made it available on the Internet. A hypertext server is a computer that stores 
files written in the hypertext markup language, and lets other computers connect to it 
and read the files. Berners-Lee, who was familiar with Standard Generalized Markup 
Language (SGML)—a set of rules that organizations have used for many years to manage

large document-filing systems—began developing a subset of SGML that he called 
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). 
HTML, like all markup languages, includes a set of codes (or tags) attached to text. 
These codes describe the relationships among text elements. For example, HTML 
includes tags that indicate which text is part of a header element, which text is part of 
a paragraph element, and which text is part of a numbered list element. One important 
type of tag is the hypertext link tag. A hypertext link, or hyperlink, points to another loca-
tion in the same or another HTML document. HTML documents can also include links 
to other types of files, such as word-processing documents, spreadsheets, graphics, audio 
clips, and video clips.
An HTML document differs from a word-processing document because it does not 
specify how a particular text element will appear. For example, you might use word-
processing software to create a document heading by setting the heading text font to 
Arial, its font size to 14 points, and its position to centered. The document displays and 
prints these exact settings whenever you open the document in the word processor. In 
contrast, an HTML document surrounds the text with a pair of heading tags to indicate 
that the text should be considered a heading. Many programs can read HTML docu-
ments. The programs recognize the heading tags and display the text in whatever manner 
that program normally displays headings. Different programs might display the heading 
text differently.
Like the Internet itself, standards for HTML are not controlled by any central manag-
ing organization. Standards for technologies that are used on the Web (including HTML) 
are developed and promulgated by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an interna-
tional organization formed in 1994 and sponsored by universities and businesses from 
around the world. Berners-Lee was appointed director of the W3C when it was formed 
and continues in that position today.
Evolution of Web Browsers
A Web browser displays an HTML document in an easy-to-read format in its graphi-
cal user interface. A graphical user interface (GUI, pronounced “gooey”) is a way of 
presenting program output using pictures, icons, and other graphical elements instead 
of just displaying text. All personal computers now use a GUI. The GUI presented in 
Web browsers played an important part in the rapid growth of the Web. The first Web 
browsers were text-based and lacked the graphical elements, such as buttons, that make 
today’s browsers so easy to use. Figure A-10 shows a Web page displayed in Lynx, a text-
based browser that was commonly used in the early days of the Web. As you can see, it 
does not look very much like the Web pages displayed by Web browsers today.

In 1993, a group of students led by Marc Andreessen at the University of Illinois wrote 
Mosaic, the first GUI program that could read HTML and use hyperlinks to navigate from 
page to page on computers anywhere on the Internet. Mosaic was the first Web browser 
that became widely available for PCs. Figure A-11 shows a Web page from 1993 dis-
played in an early version of the Mosaic Web browser.

In 1994, Andreessen and other members of the University of Illinois Mosaic team 
joined with James Clark of Silicon Graphics to found Netscape Communications. The 
university was not happy when the team decided to leave the school and develop a 
commercial browser. The university refused to allow the team to use the name “Mosaic.” 
Netscape’s first browser was called the “Mosaic Killer” or “Mozilla.” Soon after its 
release, the product was renamed Netscape Navigator. The program was an instant suc-
cess. Netscape became one of the fastest growing software companies at the time.
Microsoft created its Internet Explorer Web browser and entered the market soon after 
Netscape’s success. Microsoft offered its browser at no cost to computer owners using 
its Windows operating system. Within a few years, most users had switched to Internet 
Explorer and Netscape was unable to earn enough money to stay in business. 
Microsoft was accused of wielding its monopoly power to drive Netscape out of 
business; these accusations led to the trial of Microsoft on charges that it violated U.S. 
antitrust laws. The charges were settled in a consent decree, but other violations by 
Microsoft led to a second trial in which the company was found guilty. Parts of Netscape 
were sold to America Online, but the browser became open-source software. 
Open-source software is created and maintained by volunteer programmers, often 
many of them, who work together using the Internet to build and refine a program. The 
program is made available to users at no charge. The open-source release of Netscape is 
called Mozilla, which recalls the name of the original Netscape product. In an interest-
ing turn of Web history, the Netscape Navigator browser available today is based on the 
Mozilla open-source software.
The proliferation of tools to make the Internet more usable led to an explosion in the 
amount of information stored online. The number of Web sites has grown more rapidly 
than the Internet itself. Figure A-12 shows the growth in the Web during its lifetime.

After a dip between 2001 and 2002, growth in the number of Web sites resumed at 
its rapid rate. As individual Web sites become larger, they include many more pages. 
Experts agree that the number of pages available on the Web today exceeds 1 trillion, 
and that number is increasing faster than ever. As more people have access to the Web, 
commercial uses of the Web as well as its nonbusiness uses will continue to increase.

Businesses That Provide Internet Access
As NSFNET converted the main traffic-carrying backbone portion of its network to private 
firms, it organized the network around four network access points (NAPs), which were 
operated by four different telecommunications companies. These four companies and 
their successors sell access to the Internet through their NAPs to organizations and busi-
nesses that, in turn, provide Internet access to other businesses and individuals. These 
firms are called Internet access providers (IAPs) or Internet service providers (ISPs). 
Most of the firms call themselves ISPs because they offer more than access to the 
Internet. ISPs usually provide their customers with software to connect to the ISP, browse 
the Web, send and receive email messages, and perform functions such as file transfer 
and remote login to other computers. ISPs often provide network consulting and Web 
design services to their customers. Some ISPs have developed a range of services that 
include network management, training, and marketing advice. 
Large ISPs that sell Internet access and other services to businesses are called commerce 
service providers (CSPs) because they help businesses conduct business activities (or 
commerce) on the Internet. The larger ISPs sell Internet access to smaller ISPs, which then 
sell access and services to their own business and individual customers. The hierarchy of 
Internet service providers appears in Figure A-13.
One of the most important differences among different levels of ISPs is the connection 
bandwidth an ISP can offer. 
Bandwidth and Types of Connectivity
Bandwidth is the amount of data that can travel through a communications circuit in 
one second. The bandwidth an ISP can deliver depends on the connection it has to the 
Internet and the connection you have to the ISP.
The available bandwidth for any type of network connection between two points is 
limited to the narrowest bandwidth that exists in any part of the network. For example, 
if you connect to an ISP through a regular telephone line, your bandwidth is limited 
to the bandwidth of that telephone line, regardless of the bandwidth connection that 
the ISP has to the Internet. Bandwidth for Internet connections is measured the same 
way as bandwidth for connections within networks, in multiples of bits per second 
(bps). Common terms are kilobits per second (Kbps), which is 1,024 bps; megabits 
per second (Mbps), which is 1,048,576 bps; and gigabits per second (Gbps), which is 
1,073,741,824 bps.

Sometimes computer users are confused by the use of bits to measure bandwidth 
because file sizes are measured in bytes. As explained earlier, a byte is eight bits; it 
is abbreviated with an uppercase “B.” A kilobyte (KB) is 1,024 bytes, or 8,192 bits. 
A megabyte (MB) is 1,048,576 bytes (or 8,388,608 bits), and a gigabyte (GB) is 
1,073,741,824 bytes (or 8,589,934,592 bits).
Most LANs today run either Fast Ethernet, which operates at 100 Mbps, or Gigabit 
Ethernet, which operates at 1 Gbps. Some older LANs use an earlier version of Ethernet 
that operates at 10 Mbps. The effective bandwidth of wireless LANs depends on the 
distance between computers and what types of barriers the wireless signals must pass 
through (for example, wireless signals travel more easily through glass than steel). Most 
wireless LANs achieve an operating bandwidth of between 2 Mbps and 10 Mbps, 
although newer wireless devices with more than 100 Mbps are available. Figure A-14 
shows examples of typical times required to send different types of files over different 
types of LANs.

When you extend your network beyond a local area, either through a WAN or by 
connecting to the Internet, the speed of the connection depends on the type of connec-
tion. One way to connect computers or networks over longer distances is to use regu-
lar telephone service (sometimes referred to as dial-up, POTS, or plain old telephone 
service). Regular telephone service to most U.S. residential and business customers 
provides a maximum bandwidth of between 28.8 Kbps and 56 Kbps. The rates vary 
because the United States has different telephone companies that do not all use the same 
technology. 
When you connect your computer, which communicates using digital signals, to 
another computer through a telephone line, which uses analog signals, you must convert 
the signals from one form to the other. The device that performs this signal conversion is 
a modem, which is short for “modulator-demodulator.” Converting a digital signal to an 
analog signal is called modulation; converting that analog signal back into digital form 
is called demodulation. A modem performs both functions; it acts as a modulator and a 
demodulator.

Some telephone companies offer a higher grade of service that uses one of a series of 
protocols called Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or Digital Subscriber Loop (DSL). The first 
technology that was developed using a DSL protocol is called Integrated Services Digital 
Network (ISDN). ISDN service has been available in various parts of the United States 
since 1984. Although considerably more expensive than regular telephone service, ISDN 
offers bandwidths of up to 256 Kbps. ISDN is much more widely available in Australia, 
France, Germany, Japan, and Singapore than in the United States because the regula-
tory structure of the telecommunications industries in those countries encouraged rapid 
deployment of this new technology.
All technologies based on the DSL protocol require the implementing telephone com-
pany to install new equipment at its switching stations, which can be very expensive. 
New technologies that use the DSL protocol are currently being implemented around the 
world. One of those, Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL, also abbreviated DSL), 
offers transmission speeds ranging from 16 to 640 Kbps from the user to the telephone 
company, and from 1.5 to 9 Mbps from the telephone company to the user.
Businesses and large organizations often obtain their Internet connection by connecting 
to an ISP using higher-bandwidth telephone company connections called T-1 (1.544 Mbps) 
and T-3 (44.736 Mbps) connections. (T-1 and T-3 were originally acronyms for Telephone 1 
and Telephone 3, respectively, but few people use these terms any longer.) Companies with 
operations in multiple locations sometimes lease T-1 and T-3 lines from telephone compa-
nies to create their own WANs to connect their locations to each other.
T-1 and T-3 connections are much more expensive than POTS or ISDN connec-
tions; however, organizations that must link hundreds or thousands of individual users 
to WANs or to the Internet require the greater bandwidth of T-1 and T-3 connections. 
Smaller firms can save money by renting access to a partial T-1 connection from a tele-
phone company. In a partial T-1 rental, the connection is shared with other companies.
The NAPs operate the Internet backbone using a variety of connections. In addition 
to T-1 and T-3 lines, the NAPs use newer connections with bandwidths of more than 
1 Gbps—in some cases exceeding 10 Gbps. These connection options use fiber-optic 
cables, and are referred to as OC3, OC12, and so forth. OC is short for optical carrier. 
NAPs also use high-bandwidth satellite and radio communications links to transfer data 
over long distances.
A group of research universities and the NSF now operate a network called Internet2 
that has backbone bandwidths greater than 10 Gbps. The Internet2 project continues 
the tradition of the DARPA scientists by sponsoring research at the frontiers of network 
technologies.
A connection option available in the United States and some other countries is to 
connect to the Internet through a cable television company. The cable company trans-
mits data in the same cables used to provide television service. Cable can deliver up 
to 10 Mbps to a user and can accept up to 768 Kbps from a user. Cable connections 
usually deliver speeds between 500 Kbps and 3 Mbps, although some cable companies 
offer guarantees of higher speeds (for higher monthly fees). These speeds far exceed 
those of existing POTS and ISDN connections, and are comparable to speeds provided 
by the ADSL technologies currently implemented by telephone companies and other 
companies that rent facilities from the telephone companies.
Another option that is commonly used in remote geographic areas where cabled 
connections are more difficult to install is connecting by satellite, which uses satellites 
orbiting the earth to send and receive signals from dishes mounted on rooftops. Using a 
satellite-dish receiver, users can download at a bandwidth of approximately 400 Kbps. In 
the early days of satellite Internet access, users could not send information to the Internet 
using a satellite-dish antenna, so they needed to also have an ISP account to send files 
or email. Today, most satellite ISPs install transmitters on the dish antenna. This allows 
two-way satellite connections to the Internet. Because satellite connections are afford-
able and easy to install, they are used now throughout the world, and not just in remote 
geographic areas.

Appendix A The Internet and the World Wide Web | Internet
The actual bandwidth provided by all these Internet connection methods varies from 
provider to provider and with the amount of traffic on the Internet. During peak operat-
ing hours, traffic on the Internet can become congested, resulting in slower data trans-
mission. The bandwidth achieved is limited to the lowest amount of bandwidth available 
at any point in the network. To picture this, think of water flowing through a set of pipes 
with varying diameters, or traffic moving through a section of highway with a lane clo-
sure. The water (or traffic) slows to the speed it can maintain through the narrowest part 
of its pathway.
Figure A-15 shows typical file transmission times for various types of Internet con-
nection options. The speeds shown are examples of what a user can expect on average 
during download operations. Faster Internet connections cost significantly more money 
than slower connections.

OBJECTIVES
• Use and expand the skills you 
learned in Tutorials 3 and 4

Locating and 
Evaluating Health 
Care Information 
on the Internet
Some Web sites provide information about medical care, prescription 
drugs, and related health topics. Many doctors and other health care 
professionals have concerns about the quality of medical and health 
resources available on the Internet because anyone can post anything 
on the Web—there are no requirements for or restrictions on giving 
medical advice in this manner. Many health information Web sites 
include incorrect or incomplete information about health issues.
When you need information about a specific disease or medical 
condition, you can use one of the many sites on the Internet to 
conduct your research. In some cases, you might visit sites that are 
associated with credible research institutions, medical facilities, and 
universities. Sites in these categories include the Medical College 
of Wisconsin HealthLink, WebMD, and the Mayo Clinic. When you 
visit the sites of these organizations, you can read about the specific 
disease or medical condition that interests you, and often you will 
find links to other sites that provide more information. For example, 
if you are trying to learn about emphysema, a condition commonly 
associated with smoking cigarettes, one of these sites might provide 
information about the condition and links to other Web sites, such 
as the American Lung Association, where you can get more detailed 
information.
Just like any other Web site, you must carefully evaluate the quality 
of the resources and the information it provides. Sometimes you can 
make these determinations easily. For example, the American Lung 
Association is a well-known health organization that was founded

in 1904 to fight tuberculosis and other lung diseases using donations and resources from 
public and private sources, foundations, and government agencies. Other resources, however, 
might be more difficult to evaluate because you might not be familiar with them. Fortunately, 
accrediting agencies that evaluate health information sites have their own Web sites that 
provide information about medical sites. Two of these sites are the Health on the Net (HON) 
Foundation and the URAC Health Web Site Accreditation. You can use the resources at these 
sites and other credentialing sites to evaluate health resources you find on the Internet. In 
some cases, the credentialing site might let you search its database to locate sites that it has 
already deemed credible using its own sets of rules, guidelines, and quality standards.
In this assignment, you will select a specific disease or medical condition that interests you 
(or your instructor might provide one for you to use), find information about it, and then use a 
credentialing site to evaluate its resources.
1. Visit at least two health information sites to obtain information about the disease or 
medical condition you selected. You can use your favorite search engine or directory 
to find the sites. Gather the information and evaluate the quality of the information 
and the quality of the Web site from which you obtained it.
2. Visit at least one credentialing or accreditation site and review its contents. Write a 
summary that describes how the site operates and evaluate whether the site accom-
plishes its goals.
3. Visit a site maintained by the U.S. government that offers health care informa-
tion, such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the U.S. 
National Institutes of Health MedlinePlus. Explore the site you selected and then write 
a review of the site in which you describe how the government-sponsored site is dif-
ferent from the privately operated sites you already visited. Provide your responses in 
a report for your instructor.

Evaluating 
Encyclopedia 
Resources on the 
Internet
In Tutorials 3, 4, and 5, you learned techniques for locating and 
evaluating information on the Internet. When evaluating the 
information, you learned methods to ensure that it is complete, 
thorough, unbiased, and free from security threats such as viruses. 
As you search for information, you must assume responsibility for 
interpreting and analyzing the information you collect to make sure 
that it meets these criteria.
When you use Google or another search engine to search for 
information about a topic, chances are very good that your search 
results will include links to information that is posted on Wikipedia. 
Wikipedia, which began in 2001, is a much younger “ency-
clopedia” than its published counterparts, such as World Book 
Encyclopedia (which is more than 95 years old) or Encyclopedia 
Britannica (which is more than 220 years old). World Book 
Encyclopedia and Encyclopedia Britannica have established stan-
dards for research and information that rely on accredited and 
credentialed authors for content, subject matter experts for thor-
ough reviews of that content, and editorial boards of experts in 
various fields to set standards for content. This established process 
of writing and reviewing greatly reduces problems related to bias or 
inaccuracies.
Wikipedia, on the other hand, does not apply these same types 
of standards to its content. The content that you find in Wikipedia 
might be written and reviewed by a casual user or an expert. 
According to the Wikipedia Web site, since its creation in 2001, 
over 82,000 people have actively contributed to more than 19 mil-
lion articles in more than 270 languages. As a result of this collabo-
ration, Wikipedia is one of the largest resource sites on the Internet. 
This collaboration of individuals has resulted in an enormous 
accumulation of knowledge. However, because material is freely 
contributed by people who might not be subject matter experts, 
and edited and reviewed by people with their own unique perspec-
tives and biases, Wikipedia’s content is subject to different quality 
standards than you might find in other publications.
OBJECTIVES
• Use and expand the skills you 
learned in Tutorials 3, 4, and 5
• Explore the content 
requirements and processes 
for published encyclopedia 
resources
• Examine the content of 
and quality controls for a 
collaborative encyclopedia

• Evaluate encyclopedia 
resources available on the Web 
and their role in research

Internet | Additional Research Assignment 2 Evaluating Encyclopedia Resources on the Internet
In this assignment, you will explore some of the pros and cons of using a collaborative site 
such as Wikipedia as a resource when conducting research.
1. Use your favorite search engine or directory to find the Web site for World Book 
Encyclopedia, and then use the “About Us,” “Board,” “Reviews,” or other similarly 
named links on the publisher’s Web site to learn about its contribution requirements 
and other quality assurance policies. (You might need to review several pages at the 
site to get a full picture of the encyclopedia’s quality assurance standards.) Pay par-
ticular attention to author and reviewer credential requirements, review processes 
that ensure quality content, and any processes listed for making corrections to the 
published works.
2. Return to your search engine, and then find the Web site for Encyclopedia Britannica. 
Use the guidelines in Step 1 to evaluate the contribution requirements and quality 
assurance policies for this Web site.
3. Return to your search engine, and then search using the term Wikipedia quality issues 
and explore the links to learn about some controversies that have arisen as a result of 
Wikipedia’s collaborative nature. Be sure to review material that details specific prob-
lems that have occurred and try to understand, what, if any, measures Wikipedia has 
taken to resolve these problems.
4. Referring back to the information you gathered in Steps 1 and 2 and the research you 
did in Step 3, what is your opinion of the use of traditional encyclopedias such as 
World Book Encyclopedia or Encyclopedia Britannica when compared to an online 
collaborative project such as Wikipedia? What role does each encyclopedia play in 
the field of research? How would you use each of these sources when conducting 
research? What level of confidence do you place in each source, and why? Provide 
your responses in a report for your instructor.

Advances in 
Distance Learning
The Internet has enhanced the way that students in grades kinder-
garten through 12 learn about and participate in scientific research. 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) began 
its historic Mars Exploration Rover Mission, which is a long-term 
robotic exploration of the planet Mars, in June, 2003 and suc-
cessfully landed a rover on the planet surface in January, 2004. 
NASA teamed with the Mars Education Program at Arizona State 
University to offer students in the United States the opportunity to 
participate in the Mars Student Imaging Project (MSIP). MSIP lets 
students in grades 5 through college sophomore level work in teams 
with scientists on the Mars project and choose a site on the Mars 
planet that they would like to map (photograph) from an orbiting 
rover. Archived data is also available for students to use in research 
projects. Students participate in the project through distance learn-
ing, which is made possible through video conferencing, chats, and 
teleconferencing. Students complete their projects by writing and 
submitting a final scientific report for publication in the online MSIP 
Science Journal.
OBJECTIVES
• Use and expand the skills you 
learned in Tutorials 3, 4, and 5
• Learn about the Mars Student 
Imaging Project
• Find distance learning 
programs at your school or in 
your area
• Consider ways that distance 
learning can enhance

In this assignment, you will explore the Mars Student Imaging Project site and other distance 
learning sites that you find on the Internet. Then you will consider the future of using distance 
learning to enhance the education of grade school and college students.
1. Use your favorite search engine to locate the Mars Student Imaging Project Web site, 
and then explore the site to learn more about the project. Which Internet technologies 
make this project possible for students located in the United States?
2. Use your search engine to explore distance learning opportunities at your own school 
or at other colleges and universities in your area. How do these programs compare to 
the Mars Student Imaging Project? Which Internet technologies make these programs 
possible? Are all students able to participate in distance learning programs? Why or 
why not?
3. Based on your findings, determine other ways schools can use the Internet to enhance 
the education of grade school and college students. Are there technological impedi-
ments that prevent this method of learning? If so, what are they? What advantages 
do these types of programs offer students and educators? Provide your responses in a 
report for your instructor.

The Future of the 
Semantic Web
Tim Berners-Lee, widely regarded as the founding father of the 
Web, has been active in promoting and developing a project that 
blends technologies and information to create a next-generation 
Web, which he calls the Semantic Web. Today, people are the pri-
mary users of the Web as a communication medium. An increasing 
portion of the traffic on the Internet, however, is computers com-
municating with other computers. The Semantic Web is intended to 
facilitate automated computer-to-computer communication that can 
support all types of human activity.
The Semantic Web project, as currently conceived, would result 
in words on Web pages being tagged with their meanings (the 
meanings of words are called semantics, thus the name “Semantic 
Web”). These tags would turn the Web into a huge computer-
readable database. People could use intelligent programs called 
software agents to read the Web page tags to determine the mean-
ing of the words in their contexts. For example, a software agent 
could be given an instruction to find an airline ticket with certain 
terms (such as a specific date, destination city, and a cost limit). The 
software agent would launch a Web search and return an electronic 
ticket that meets the criteria. Instead of a user having to visit several 
Web sites to gather information, compare prices and itineraries, and 
make a decision, the software agent would automatically do the 
searching, comparing, and purchasing.
The key elements that must be added to Web standards so that 
software agents can perform these functions (and thus create the 
Semantic Web) include a well-defined tagging system and a set of 
standards. Many researchers working on the Semantic Web proj-
ect believe that Extensible Markup Language (XML) could work 
as a tagging system. Unlike HTML, which has a common set of 
defined tags (for example, <h1> is the tag for a level-one heading), 
XML tags are defined by users. Different users can create different 
definitions for the same XML tag. If a group of users agrees on a 
common set of definitions, they can all use the same XML tags. For 
the Semantic Web to work, everyone must agree on a common set 
of XML tags that will be used on the Web. Semantic Web research-
ers call this common set of tag definitions a resource description 
OBJECTIVES

framework (RDF). An ontology is a set of standards that defines, in detail, the relationships 
among RDF standards and specific XML tags within a particular knowledge domain. For 
example, the ontology for cooking would include concepts such as ingredients, utensils, and 
ovens; however, it would also include rules and behavioral expectations, such as identifying 
ingredients that can be mixed using utensils, the resulting product that can be eaten by people, 
and ovens that generate heat within a confined area. Ontologies and the RDF would provide 
the intelligence about the knowledge domain so that software agents could make decisions as 
humans would.
In this assignment, you will search for information about the Semantic Web and evaluate its 
potential for future use.
1. Use your favorite search engine to find sites with information about the Semantic 
Web, XML, RDF, and the term “ontology” as it is used in this area of research (the term 
“ontology” is used in philosophy and other disciplines, so you will need to use some 
of the techniques you learned in Tutorial 3 to narrow your results). Prepare a report 
that summarizes your findings on each of the four topics. Include citations for at least 
two Web pages for each of the four topics in your report.
2. For each of the eight (or more) Web pages you cited in the report required by the pre-
vious step, evaluate the quality of the information you obtained and evaluate the over-
all quality of the Web site from which you obtained it. Summarize your evaluations in 
your report. Be sure to include the reasons for your evaluations and explain how you 
performed the evaluations.
3. Using the information you have gathered about the Semantic Web, evaluate the likeli-
hood that it will become a useful part of the Web within the next 10 years. Include a 
summary of your evaluation in your report and cite the Web sources that support your 
arguments.

Using a Web 
Site to Translate 
Business 
Correspondence
The Internet began as a series of research projects, mostly funded 
by the U.S. government. As the Internet expanded, people around 
the world started using the Internet for research and, eventually, for 
general information, entertainment, and to conduct online business 
activity.
The Internet contains resources that are written in languages from 
around the world. Because an important function of the Internet 
is to enhance communication, the global nature of the Internet 
often introduces and connects people who do not speak the same 
language. The need to translate email messages and the content 
of Web pages from one language to another has become very 
important.
Hiring human translators to do this work can be expensive. One 
solution for some applications is machine translation, in which a 
computer does a rough translation. Some Web sites that offer free 
machine translation tools are Yahoo! Babel Fish, Bing Translator, 
Google Translate, and SDL FreeTranslation.com.
The success of machine translation depends greatly on the type of 
information being translated. One way to check the quality of a 
translation (human or machine) is to take the result of the transla-
tion and translate it back into the original language. This process is 
called back-translation.
OBJECTIVES
• Use and expand the skills you 
learned in Tutorials 4 and 9
• Use a Web site to translate 
statements into another 
language and then back into 
English
• Evaluate the quality of the 
translation
• Evaluate the effectiveness of 
using machine translation in 
business

Internet | Additional Research Assignment 5 Using a Web Site to Translate Business Correspondence
In this assignment, you will evaluate the quality of online machine translation by translating 
several business-related statements into a foreign language, and then translating them back 
into English.
1.	Use a search engine to locate one of the previously mentioned Web sites that provides 
online translation tools. Use the site to translate each of the following statements into 
another language of your choice, and then translate the result back into English.
a.	The scheduled arrival date of your order will be delayed.
b.	The crane operators’ union at the port of embarkation has walked out on strike. This 
will delay the shipment of your order until at least one week after the work stop-
page has been resolved. We will keep you apprised of developments.
c.	We appreciate the opportunity to bid on your project. To create a bid, we will need 
the detailed mechanical drawings by next Thursday, along with the supervising 
engineer’s specifications list for all key parts.
d.	Our current catalog offers the hottest discounts on all in-stock items. We can meet 
all of your office furniture needs promptly. With our everyday low pricing, we can 
beat anybody in the business. Our extended warranties and service plans make us 
the top dog when it comes to wrapping up the job.
2.	Evaluate the success of the machine translations of these four statements. In particular, 
identify the elements in each statement that were troublesome for the translation tool 
you used, and explain why you believe they were troublesome.
3.	Provide an overall evaluation of the usefulness of machine translation technology in 
business communication on the Internet. Describe one specific situation in which you 
would use an online translation tool, and then describe a second specific situation in 
which you would be reluctant to use such a tool. Provide your responses in a report 
for your instructor.

Using Short 
Message Service
Short Message Service (SMS), more commonly called text messag-
ing, is a technology that allows the transmission of text messages 
between mobile devices, such as smartphones. Unlike email mes-
sages, text messages are limited in size (currently 160 characters) 
and cannot include graphics or photographic images. Some ser-
vices allow you to send longer messages, but they automatically 
break the messages into smaller units (so they do not exceed the 
160-character limit) and send them as separate messages.
Text messaging use has grown rapidly and is useful for sending 
short messages, such as “Am running late, see you in 30 minutes.” 
Many wireless service providers offer SMS service as part of their 
cellular or broadband service packages. Some providers charge 
for SMS service by the message, but most carriers offer plans that 
include a certain number of messages (or unlimited messages) for a 
fixed monthly fee. Some wireless service providers also offer sepa-
rate messaging functions (in addition to SMS) that allow you to send 
picture and video messages.
Because text messages use much less bandwidth than voice trans-
missions, they can be useful for communicating when wireless 
circuits become overloaded with unusually large amounts of traffic, 
which can happen any time many people want to send a quick 
communication to others. Thus, text messaging can be an impor-
tant function when a natural disaster strikes and communications 
systems become overwhelmed. It can also be useful in less pressing 
circumstances, such as at midnight on New Year’s Eve, when many 
people want to send a greeting at the same time.
OBJECTIVES
• Use and expand the skills you 
learned in Tutorials 2 and 7
• Learn more about Short 
Message Service
• Examine the costs of sending 
messages
• Consider ways to improve text 
messaging services

Evaluating the 
Use of Blogs in 
Business
In this book, you learned how to use email messages to commu-
nicate with another person, a group of people, or a mailing list. 
You also learned about newsgroups and how to use them to obtain 
information about a specific topic, and how to use instant messag-
ing, text messaging, blogs, and microblogs to communicate with 
another person or with groups of people. Each of these methods 
of communication requires different levels of participation from 
the user. For example, to use instant messaging software, you must 
install a program on your computer or wireless device; to join a 
mailing list or a discussion group, you must use your email program 
or a newsreader to obtain the messages. To write a blog or microb-
log, you need access to the Internet and software that publishes and 
distributes your postings.
Although blogs have been around since 1996, the availability of 
automated blog publishing systems from Web sites such as Blogger, 
WordPress, and LiveJournal gave them the boost they needed to 
become commonplace on the Web. Media attention increased 
their popularity in the 2004 presidential campaign when Howard 
Dean, who pursued but eventually lost the Democratic nomination 
for president, was the first presidential candidate to use a blog to 
rally his supporters across the country, to provide updates from his 
campaign, and to let people join discussions about current top-
ics. By the 2008 presidential campaign, virtually all of the major 
candidates used blogs. There are hundreds of thousands of blogs 
on the Web related to all kinds of topics. Some directories, such as 
Google, identify blogs based on their category, such as news, arts, 
or sports.
Users need minimal expertise to create or contribute to a blog, and 
there is little or no expense associated with the technology. Most 
sites that offer automated publishing systems offer free or inexpen-
sive accounts that new bloggers can use to set up their own blogs, 
making it easy for anyone to publish their thoughts on the Web. 
Specific features vary by company, but all automate the process of 
publishing chronologically arranged postings.
OBJECTIVES
• Use and expand the skills you 
learned in Tutorial 5
• Visit blogs to evaluate their 
content
• Consider ways to use blogs 
in business to enhance 
communication
• Consider some of the 
advantages and disadvantages 
of using blogs

Internet | Additional Research Assignment 7 Evaluating the Use of Blogs in Business
Although individuals maintain most blogs, new bloggers include corporations, attorneys, and 
educators who have discovered the appeal of this technology for making information available 
to clients, building a practice, or creating academic knowledge communities.
In this assignment, you will learn more about automated blog publishing systems and consider 
ways to use this technology to enhance communication and develop business relationships. 
Summarize your findings in a report to your instructor.
1.	Most blogs are collections of an individual’s personal posts, but blogs can also allow 
a group of people to engage in a collaborative discussion. Use Google Blogs to find a 
categorical listing of blogs. Evaluate a couple of blogs in business-related categories, 
such as library science, news, or science. How does the information provided in the 
blog compare to using email, instant messaging, chat, or newsgroups as a commu-
nication tool? What value does a blog add to the topic? Can you identify any unique 
advantages of communicating using blogs that you cannot gain from other types of 
Internet communication? 
2.	Find a political candidate’s blog and evaluate its content. What types of information 
are included in the blog? How does it differ from information presented elsewhere on 
the candidate’s Web site? What is the impact, if any, on traditional news media outlets 
of the dissemination of political news through blogs?
3.	Find a corporate blog and assess its content. What competitive advantages can blogs 
offer companies? 
4.	Some blogs that are affiliated with faculty members of colleges and universities.

Reintermediating 
Travel Services
The travel agency business has changed dramatically over the years 
as Web sites selling travel-related services, such as airline tickets, 
rental cars, and hotel reservations have replaced businesses that 
employed travel agents to locate these services and sell them to rec-
reational and business travelers. In the past, travel agencies earned 
revenues from commissions on airline tickets, but airlines have 
mostly eliminated these commissions. Many travel agents (including 
online travel sites) now charge their customers a flat fee for book-
ing flights; however, many customers object to paying such fees. 
This disintermediation has affected all travel agents, but small travel 
agencies that do not have Web sites have been hurt the most.
One way to address the revenue problems caused by disintermedia-
tion is for travel agencies to explore reintermediation opportunities. 
One reintermediation strategy for a small travel agency is to create 
a Web site that serves as an online meeting area for people desiring 
information about a specific travel opportunity, such as vacations 
involving surfing. The stereotypical surfer of the past was a young, 
unemployed male. Surfers today come from a broader demographic. 
Many surfers have significant financial resources and enjoy surfing in 
many worldwide locations. Web sites such as WaveHunters.com and 
WannaSurf.com have followed a reintermediation strategy and cater 
to this highly specialized market in ways that general travel agents 
have not.

Internet | Additional Research Assignment 8 Reintermediating Travel Services
In this assignment, you will assume the role of a travel agency that is seeking to design a Web 
site that caters to surfers. You will examine surfing Web sites, consider ways to build a social 
network that will draw surfers to a Web site, and identify Web sites that a travel agency should 
consider using in its online advertising campaigns.
1.	Use your favorite search engine to find at least two sites that offer surf vacation pack-
ages for sale, such as WaveHunters.com and WannaSurf.com. For each of the two 
sites you find, list at least four Web site elements that you believe a new travel agency 
could use on its Web site. Also list at least two Web site elements that the travel 
agency should avoid using. For each item on your lists, explain why you classified it 
the way you did.
2.	Create a sketch to design a home page for a new travel agency that includes the four  
elements you included in Step 1. After completing your sketch, write a summary of 
each element that you plan to use and describe the technologies that you need to 
implement them.
3.	Describe how you would use social networking sites to attract people who are inter-
ested in exotic surf vacations to the new Web site. Explain how your ideas would con-
tribute to the overall goal of reaching people who are likely to buy travel services.
4.	Use your favorite search engine to find surfing interest Web sites on which the new 
travel agency could purchase advertising space. Choose three specific sites that you 
believe are good choices. For each site you select, explain your rationale for choosing 
that site. Provide your responses in a report for your instructor.
