Example 1: Personality

Personality	

•  “As any parent of more than one child 
knows, children are not indistinguishable 
lumps of raw material waiting to be 
shaped. They are little people, born with 
personalities.” – Steven Pinker

Personality	

5 
Personality	

•  Personality traits 
– Traits are considered to be relatively stable, 
distinguishable qualities of a person 
6 
Personality	

•  The Big Five personality traits 
•  Openness 
•  Conscientiousness 
•  Extraversion 
•  Agreeableness 
•  Neuroticism 
•  OCEAN 
7 
Personality	

•  Survey questions 
– Examples of questions to measure 
extraversion 
•  Q1: I am the life of the party 
•  Q2: I don't mind being the center of attention

Personality	

•  The theory of five components of 
personality is supported by correlational 
research 
– Surveys, interviews, & observations of 
behavior 
– For more information, see

Intelligence	

14 
Intelligence 	

•  Intelligence: “A very general mental capability that, 
among other things, involves the ability to reason, 
plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend 
complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from 
experience. It is not merely book learning, a narrow 
academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects 
a broader and deeper capability for comprehending 
our surroundings—"catching on," "making sense" of 
things, or "figuring out" what to.” – Wall Street Journal, 
1994	

15 
Intelligence	

•  Theories of intelligence have been proposed 
based on detailed analysis of patterns of 
correlations across different types of tests	

– I refer to these as “studies” of intelligence rather 
than “experiments” because no variable is 
manipulated (no independent variable)

Intelligence	

•  The hierarchical model of intelligence is 
supported by correlational research	

– There is a general ability, and	

– Several more speciﬁc abilities	

– For more information, see	

•  Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of intelligence

Sports-related concussion	

24 

10/12/13	

7	

Effects of concussion	

•  Sports-related concussions, especially in 
American football, are common and may cause 
neural damage and cognitive deﬁcits	

25 
Effects of concussion	

•  Quasi-independent variable	

– Treatment	

•  Suffered a sports-related concussion	

•  Control group	

•  Dependent variable	

– Neural measures	

– Cognitive measures	

26 
Effects of concussion	

27 
Effects of concussion	

•  Confounds?	

– Prior concussions	

– Prior hits to the head (not necessarily concussions)	

– Personality types more likely to be aggressive	

28

Effects of concussion	

•  Quasi-independent variable	

– Since the IV does not involve random and 
representative sampling, arguments about causality 
are not as strong	

29 
Lecture Summary	

•  Important concepts	

– Correlational research / Experimental research	

– I will refer to examples of correlational research as 
“studies” and examples of experimental research 
as “experiments”	

30 
Lecture Summary	

•  Important concepts	

–  Many theories, especially of personality and 
intelligence, have been tested by investigating patterns 
of correlations obtained from observational studies	

–  Some things simply can’t be experimentally 
manipulated, for example, concussions! Hence, quasi-
independent variables
