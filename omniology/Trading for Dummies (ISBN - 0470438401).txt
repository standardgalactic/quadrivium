About the Authors
Michael Grifﬁ s became an active trader in the mid 1980s. He fi rst traded 
commodities and precious-metals after taking a commodities trading class as 
part of his MBA program at Rollins College. He turned his interest in trading 
into a profession and became a stock broker in 1992, where he helped busi-
ness and individuals manage investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, 
retirement plans, 401(k) employee-savings plans, and asset management pro-
grams. Today, he mostly trades for his own account.
In addition, Michael is an author and business owner and has written about 
stock trading for online audiences. Outside of the business and investment 
world, he is active in his community and volunteers his time and talents as a 
fundraiser for civic and nonprofi t organizations. 
Lita Epstein, who earned her MBA from Emory University’s Goizueta 
Business School, enjoys helping people develop good fi nancial, investing, and 
tax planning skills. She designs and teaches online courses on topics such as 
accounting, reading fi nancial reports, investing for retirement, getting ready 
for tax time, and fi nance and investing for women. She has written more than 
20 books, including Bookkeeping for Dummies and  Reading Financial Reports 
For Dummies, both published by Wiley.
Lita was the content director for a fi nancial services Web site, MostChoice.
com and managed the Investing for Women Web site. As a Congressional 
press secretary, Lita gained fi rst-hand knowledge about how to work within 
and around the federal bureaucracy, which gives her great insight into how 
government programs work. In the past Lita has been a daily newspaper 
reporter, magazine editor, and fundraiser for The Carter Presidential Center. 
For fun, Lita enjoys scuba diving and is an underwater photographer. She 
hikes, canoes, and surfs the Web for hidden treasures.

Introduction
T
rading used to be the purview of institutional and corporate entities that 
had direct access to closed securities trading systems. Recent technical 
advances have leveled the playing field, making securities trading much 
more accessible to individuals. After the stock market crash of 2000, when 
many lost large sums of money because professional advisors or mutual fund 
managers didn’t protect their portfolio principal, investors chose one of two 
options — getting out of the market altogether and seeking safety or finding 
out more about how to manage their own portfolios. Many who came back 
into the market ran from it again in late 2008 when the market saw its worst 
year since the Great Depression.
The concept of buying and holding forever died after that 2000 stock crash; it 
saw some revival from 2004 to 2007, but then suffered another death in 2008. 
People are now looking for new ways to invest and trade. While investors still 
practice careful portfolio balancing using a buy and hold strategy, they look 
much more critically at what they are holding and are more likely to change 
their holdings now than they were before the crash. Others have gotten out 
of the stock market completely.
Still others have moved on to the world of trading. Many kinds of traders ply 
their skills in the markets. The ones who like to take on the most risk and 
want to trade as a full-time business look to day trading. They never hold 
a position in a security overnight. Swing traders hold their positions a bit 
longer, sometimes for a few days or even a few weeks.
But we’re not focusing on the riskier types of trading in this book; instead, 
we’re focusing on position trading, which involves executing trades in and 
out of positions and holding positions for a few weeks or months and maybe 
even a year or more, depending on trends that are evident in the economy, 
the marketplace, and ultimately individual stocks.
About This Book
Many people have misconceptions about trading and its risks. Most people 
think of the riskiest type of trading — day trading — whenever they hear 
the word trader. We’re definitely not trying to show you how to day trade. 
Instead, we want to introduce you to the world of position trading, which is 
much safer, less risky, and yet a great way to build a significant portfolio.

2
Trading For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Don’t get the wrong idea; trading in securities always carries risks. You 
should never trade with money that you can’t risk losing. That means trading 
with your children’s education savings isn’t a good idea. If you want to trade, 
set aside a portion of your savings that isn’t earmarked for any specific use 
and that you believe you can put at risk without ruining your lifestyle.
Obviously, we plan to show you ways to minimize risk, but we can’t promise 
that you won’t take a loss. Even the most experienced traders, the ones who 
put together the best trading systems, don’t have a crystal ball and periodically 
get hit by a market shock and accompanying loss. By using the basics of 
fundamental and technical analyses, we show you how to minimize your risk, 
how to recognize when the market is ripe for a trade, when specific sectors 
in the market are the right places to be, how to figure out which phases 
economic and market cycles are in, and how to make the best use of all that 
knowledge.
Foolish Assumptions
We’ve made a number of assumptions about your basic knowledge and 
stock-trading abilities. We assume that you’re not completely new to the 
world of investing in stocks and that you’re familiar with the stock market 
and its basic language. Although we review many key terms and phrases as 
we explore the basics of trading, if everything you read sounds totally new 
to you, you probably need to read a basic book on investing in stocks before 
trying to move on to the more technical world of trading.
We also assume that you know how to operate a computer and use the 
Internet. If you don’t have high-speed access to the Internet now, be sure you 
do have it before trying to trade. Many of the resources we recommend in 
this book are available online, but you’ll need high-speed access to be able to 
work with many of these valuable tools.
How the Book Is Organized
We’ve broken this book down into six logical parts. Well, we tried anyway. 
The first focuses on tools, and then we explore the basics of fundamental 
analysis right before delving into technical analysis. After getting the basics 
out of the way, we discuss how you can use your newly discovered tools to 
develop and begin building your own strategies and trading system. Just in 
case you want to move on to riskier types of trading, we include some basic 
information about day trading, swing trading, and trading derivatives and 
foreign currency. That said, we highly recommend that you seek additional 
training before trying any of the riskier forms of trading.

 Introduction
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: 
Gathering Your Tools
Trading is a business, and just like any other business, you need to put 
together a good set of tools to be successful. In Part I, we talk about the 
basics of trading, introduce the markets and the exchanges, discuss various 
alternatives for finding a broker and setting up your brokerage account, and 
describe the minimum computer hardware and software necessities you 
need to succeed as a trader. We also discuss your Internet needs and point 
you to some good basic resources on the Internet that can help get you 
started.
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: 
Fundamental Analysis
Many traders don’t use fundamental analysis. They believe technical analysis 
is the only thing you need to understand. We don’t agree. You can gather 
plenty of valuable information about the economy, markets, sectors, and 
individual stocks that can help you excel as a trader. We start you out with 
the economy, the basics of the business cycle, sector rotation, and various 
economic indicators, because they can help you make your calls. Next we 
show you how to delve into financial statements to find the crucial information 
you need to pick the companies whose stocks you want to trade. Finally, we 
talk about analysts and what information you can get and use from them and 
what you shouldn’t use. We also explain how you can listen in on analysts’ 
calls to get the most current information about a company and how executives 
perceive their company numbers.
Part III: Reading the Charts: 
Technical Analysis
You can’t even begin to think about trading if you don’t understand technical 
analysis and how to build and read charts so you can pick entry and exit 
points when buying and selling stocks. We take you step by step through 
the process of building a chart, and we describe how to identify trends and 
distinguish between transitions from one trend to another. In this part, you 
find out how to recognize bull and bear patterns and how to differentiate 
between a stock that is range bound and one that is trending. We also 
introduce you to some of our favorite tools and give you several examples of 
how to use them.

Trading For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Part IV: Developing Strategies for 
When to Buy and Sell Stocks
After finding out how to use the tools of fundamental and technical analyses, 
you’re ready to develop strategies for your own trading. First you need to 
explore good money discipline to avoid taking major losses and be around 
to trade for another day. You also need to determine when to stay in a 
position and when to trade out of it. You certainly want to take your profits 
at the right time, but you also want to avoid standing idly by as a profit turns 
into a loss. Next we talk about how you can gather key information through 
fundamental analysis and then add the results of your technical analysis to 
build an optimum trading strategy. And we talk about the mechanics of 
trading before finally exploring how you can build your own trading system.
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise
You may want to try the riskier forms of trading, such as swing trading, day 
trading, or trading in derivatives and foreign currency. We definitely won’t 
be sharing any strategies for actually participating in these types of trading, 
but we will introduce you to the basics and warn you about what you need to 
become familiar with before entering these wilder forms of trading. Be careful 
out there and don’t get caught up in any of the many frauds and scams that 
are common with these types of trading.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The final part of the book is a hallmark of the For Dummies series — the Part 
of Tens. In it, we highlight the top ten huge trading mistakes and ways you 
can avoid them, and we review the top ten basics you’ll need to remember 
for surviving in the world of trading.

 Introduction
Icons Used in This Book
For Dummies books use little pictures, called icons, to flag certain chunks 
of text. Here’s what they actually mean:
 
Watch for these little flags to get ideas on how to improve your trading skills 
or where to find other useful resources.
 
If there is something that is particularly important for you to remember, we 
mark it with this icon.
 
The trading world is wrought with many dangers and perils. A minor mistake 
can cost you a bunch of money, so we use this icon to point out particularly 
perilous areas.
 
When you see this icon, we’re discussing higher-end, more technical material 
for the experienced trader.
Where to Go from Here
You’re ready to enter the exciting world of trading. You can start anywhere 
in the book. Each of the chapters is self-contained. But, if you’re totally new 
to trading, starting with Chapter 1 is the best way to understand the basics. 
If you already know the basics, understand everything about the various 
markets and exchanges that you care to know, have a broker picked out, and 
have all the tools you’ll need, you may want to start with fundamental analy-
sis in Part II. Remember, though, to have fun and enjoy your trip through the 
exciting world of trading.

Part I
So You Want to Be a 
Trader: Gathering 
Your Tools

In this part . . .
Want to discover how you can be a successful trader 
and why you should want to get involved in trading? 
That’s what you get in Part I. You’ll explore the nuances of 
the various markets and trading exchanges on which you 
place your trades and find out about the brokers and the 
types of brokerage houses frequently used by traders. In 
addition, we describe what computer hardware and 
software and Internet access you’ll need and provide you 
with several useful Internet resources to get you started.

M
aking lots of money is the obvious goal of most people who decide to 
enter the world of trading. How successful you become as a trader 
depends on how well you use the tools, gather the needed information, and 
interpret what you’ve got. You need to develop the discipline to apply all that 
you know about trading toward developing a winning trading strategy.
Discovering how to avoid getting caught up in the emotional aspects of 
trading — the highs of a win and the lows of a loss — is key to developing a 
profitable trading style. Trading is a business and needs to be approached 
with the same logic you’d apply in your approach to any other business 
decision. Setting goals, researching your options, planning and implementing 
your strategies, and assessing your success are just as important for trading 
as they are for any other business venture.
In this book, we help you traverse these hurdles, and at the same time, we 
introduce you to the world of trading. In this chapter, we give you an overview 
of trading and an introduction to the tools you need, the research skills you 
must use, and the basics of developing all this information into a successful 
trading strategy.

Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Trading versus Investing
First, we need to discuss how trading differs from investing. Investors buy 
stocks and hold them for a long time — many times too long, riding a stock 
all the way down and possibly even buying more along the way. Traders, on 
the other hand, hold stocks for as little as a few minutes or as long as several 
months, and sometimes possibly even a year or more. The specific amount of 
time depends on the type of trader you want to become.
Investors want to carefully balance an investment portfolio between growth 
stocks, value stocks, domestic stocks, and foreign stocks, along with long-, 
short-, and intermediate-term bonds. A well-balanced portfolio generally 
offers the investor a steady return of between 5 percent and 12 percent, 
depending on the type of investments and amount of risk he or she is willing 
to take.
For investors, an aggressive portfolio with a mix of 80 percent invested in 
stocks and 20 percent in bonds, if well balanced, can average as high as a 
12 percent annual return during a 20-year period; however, in some years, 
the portfolio will be down, and in others, it will go through periods of high 
growth. The opposite, a conservative portfolio with 20 percent invested in 
stocks and 80 percent in bonds, is likely to provide a yield on the lower end 
of the spectrum, closer to 5 percent. The volatility and risk associated with 
the latter portfolio, however, would be considerably less. Investors who have 
10 or more years before they need to use their investment money tend to 
put together more aggressive portfolios, but those who need to live off the 
money tend to put together less aggressive portfolios that give them regular 
cash flows, which is what you get from a portfolio invested mostly in bonds.
 
As a trader, you look for the best position for your money and then set a 
goal of exceeding what an investor can otherwise expect from an aggressive 
portfolio. During certain times within the market cycle, your best option may 
be to sit on the sidelines and not even be active in the market. In this book, we 
show you how to read the signals to decide when you need to be in the 
market, and how to find the best sectors in which to play the market and the 
best stocks within those sectors.
Why Trade?
Improving your potential profit from stock transactions is obviously the key 
reason most people decide to trade. People who want to grow their portfolios 
rather than merely maintain them hope that the way they invest in them 

11
 Chapter 1: The Ups and Downs of Trading Stocks
does better than the market averages. Regardless of whether traders invest 
through mutual funds or stocks, they hope the portfolio of securities they 
select gives them superior returns — and they’re willing to work at it.
People who decide to trade make a conscious decision to take a more active 
role in increasing their profit potential. Rather than just riding the market up 
and down, they search for opportunities to find the best times and places to 
be in the market based on economic conditions and market cycles.
 
Traders who successfully watched the technical signals before the stock 
crash of 2000 either shorted stocks or moved into cash positions before 
stocks tumbled and then carefully jumped back in as they saw opportunities 
for profits. Some position traders simply stayed on the sidelines, waiting for 
the right time to jump back in. Even though they were waiting, they also 
carefully researched their opportunities, selected stocks for their watch lists, 
and then let technical signals from the charts they kept tell them when to get 
in or out of a position.
Successful Trading Characteristics
To succeed at trading, you have to be hard on yourself and, more than likely, 
work against your natural tendencies, fighting the urge to prove yourself 
right and accepting the fact that you’re going to make mistakes. As a trader, 
you must develop separate strategies for when you want to make a trade 
to enter a position and for when you want to make a trade and exit that 
position, all the while not allowing emotional considerations to affect the 
decisions you make on the basis of the successful trading strategy you’ve 
designed.
 
You want to manage your money, but in doing so, you don’t have to prove 
whether your particular buying or selling decision was right or wrong. Setting 
up stop-loss points for every position you establish and adhering to them is 
the right course of action, even though you may later have to admit that you 
were wrong. Your portfolio will survive, and you can always reenter a position 
whenever trends indicate the time is right again.
You need to make stock trends your master, ignoring any emotional ties that 
you have to any stocks. Although you may, indeed, miss the lowest entry 
price or the highest exit price, you nevertheless will be able to sleep at night, 
knowing that your money is safe and your trading business is alive and well.
 
Traders find out how to ride a trend and when to get off the train before it 
jumps the tracks and heads toward monetary disaster. Enjoy the ride, but 
know which stop you’re getting off at so you don’t turn profits into losses.

12
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Tools of the Trade
The first step you need to take in becoming a trader is gathering all the 
right tools so you can open and operate your business successfully. Your 
computer needs to meet the hardware requirements and other computer 
specifics we describe in Chapter 4, including processor speed, memory 
storage, and screen size. You may even want more than one screen, 
depending on your trading style. High-speed Internet access is a must; 
otherwise, you may as well never open up shop.
We also introduce you to the various types of software in Chapter 4, showing 
you what can help your trading business ride the wave to success. Traders’ 
charting favorites such as Metastock and Trade Station are evaluated along 
with Internet-based charting and data-feed services. We also talk about the 
various trading platforms that are available and how to work with brokers.
After you have all the hardware and software in place, you need to hone your 
analytical skills. Many traders advocate using only technical analysis, but we 
show you how using both technical and fundamental analyses can help you 
excel as a trader.
Taking Time to Trade More 
than Just Stocks
The ways traders trade are varied. Some are day traders, while others are 
swing traders and position traders. Although many of the tools they use are 
the same or similar, each variety of trader works within differing time frames 
to reach goals that are specific to the type of trades they’re making.
Position trading
Position traders use technical analysis to find the most promising stock trends 
and enter and exit positions in the market based on those trends. They can 
hold positions for just a few days, a few months, or possibly as long as a year 
or more. Position trading is the type of trading that we discuss the most in 
this book. After introducing you to the stock markets, the types of brokers 
and market-makers with whom you’ll be dealing, and the tools you need, we 
discuss the basics of fundamental analysis and technical analysis to help you 
become a better position trader.

13
 Chapter 1: The Ups and Downs of Trading Stocks
Weathering a bear market
Housing stocks crumbled in the housing crunch. 
Financials were crushed in the credit crisis.
We can’t claim any special foresight or knowl-
edge to know when a stock is about to take a 
big plunge or a company is going to be taken 
over by the Feds. We don’t have a crystal ball.
But we are able to keep most of our money safe 
from the ravages of a down market. By using 
strategies that we discuss throughout this book, 
we can exit positions before giving back most of 
our accumulated profits — while many others 
unfortunately do just that.
An impending pullback is not illuminated with 
flashing beacons. There is no instant indicator 
telling us that it is time to sell everything. 
Instead, we close individual positions as each 
stock’s technical conditions deteriorate. The 
tools we describe in this book enable us to 
recognize when risk levels have changed, when 
few stocks are attractive, and when simply 
leaving most of our trading capital in cash is 
the best course of action.
We have no idea how long the current credit 
crunch will affect the market. In fact, it’s already 
gone on longer and been much more brutal than 
we had guessed. Nevertheless, adhering to the 
techniques featured in this book has kept us 
from committing the bulk of our trading capital 
to failing stocks. We will weather this market 
with the majority of our trading capital intact 
and even make a little money by shorting a few 
stocks or buying some short or double-short 
exchange-traded funds. Thanks to the tools we 
show you in this book, we will be ready to trade 
aggressively when the technical condition of 
stocks begins improving.
Short-term swing trading
Swing traders work within much shorter time frames than position traders, rarely 
holding stocks for more than a few days and looking for sharp moves that tech-
nical analysis uncovers. Even though we don’t show you the specifics of how 
to become a swing trader, we nevertheless discuss the basics of swing trading 
and its strategies in Chapter 16. You can also read about the basics of technical 
analysis and money management strategies, both of which are useful topics to 
check out if you plan to become a swing trader. However, you definitely need to 
seek additional training before deciding to pursue this style of trading — reading 
Swing Trading For Dummies by Omar Bassal (Wiley) would be a good start.
Day trading
Day traders never leave their money in stocks overnight. They always cash 
out. They can trade into and out of a stock position in a matter of hours, 
minutes, or even seconds. Many outsiders watch day traders in action and 

14
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
describe it as more like playing a video game than trading stocks. We discuss 
this high-risk type of trading in Chapter 17, but we won’t be showing you the 
specifics of how to do it. If day trading is your goal, this book will only take 
you part of the way there. You’ll discover the basics of technical analysis, but 
you need to seek out additional training before engaging in this risky trading 
style — check out Day Trading For Dummies by Ann C. Logue (Wiley).
Going Long or Short
Before you start trading, you absolutely have to know what stocks you want 
to buy and hold for a while, which is called going long, or holding a long stock 
position. You likewise have to know at what point holding that stock is no 
longer worthwhile. Similarly, you need to know at what price you want to 
enter or trade into a position and at what price you want to exit or trade out 
of a position. You may be surprised to find out that you can even profit by 
selling a stock without ever owning it, in a process called shorting. We discuss 
these vital trading strategies in Chapter 13.
You can even make money buying and selling options on stocks to simulate 
long or short stock positions. Buying an option known as a call enables 
you to simulate a long stock position, in much the same way that buying an 
option known as a put enables you to simulate a short stock position. You 
make money on calls when the option-related stock rises in price, and you 
make money on a put when the option-related stock falls in price.
When placing orders for puts and calls, you’re never guaranteed to make 
money, even when you’re right about the direction a stock will take. The 
values of options are affected by how volatile stock prices are in relationship 
to the overall direction (up or down) in which they are headed. We discuss 
options and how they work in greater detail in Chapter 18.
Managing Your Money
Managing your trades so that you don’t lose a bunch of money is critical. 
Although we can’t guarantee that you’ll never lose money, we can provide 
you with useful strategies for minimizing your losses and getting out before 
your stock portfolio takes a huge hit. The key is knowing when to hold ’em 
and when to fold ’em, and we cover that in great detail in Chapter 12.

15
 Chapter 1: The Ups and Downs of Trading Stocks
 
One thing that we can’t emphasize enough is that you must think of your 
trading as a business and the stocks that you hold as its inventory. You can’t 
allow yourself to fall in love with and thereby hang on to a stock out of loyalty. 
You’ll find it especially hard to admit you’ve made a mistake; nevertheless, 
you have to bite the bullet and exit the position before you take a huge hit. 
You’ll discover that housecleaning and developing successful strategies for 
keeping your inventory current are important parts of managing a trading 
portfolio.
Setting a target price for exiting a position before ever trading into it is 
the best way to protect your business from major losses. Stick with those 
predetermined exit prices and you’ll avoid a major pitfall that many traders
face — holding a position too long and losing everything. You obviously 
don’t want to turn a profit into a loss, so as your position in a stock produces 
a profit, you can periodically raise your target exit price while continuing to 
hold the position to ensure that you keep most of that profit.
Understanding your risks — market risks, investment risks, and trading 
risks — helps you to make better trading decisions. We review the different 
kinds of risks as they relate to specific situations at several points throughout 
the book.
Understanding Fundamental Analysis
You’ve probably heard the phrase, “It’s the economy, stupid.” Well that’s 
true, and we show you how understanding the basics of the business cycle 
can help you improve your trading successes. In Chapter 5, you find out how 
to identify periods of economic growth and recession and how these differing 
periods impact bull and bear stock markets. We also explore sector rotation 
and how to use it to pick the right sectors for your trading activities.
You can also discover plenty of information about how money supply, 
inflation rates, deflation, joblessness, and consumer confidence impact the 
mood of the market and stock prices and how the economy can be driven 
by how confidently (or not) political and monetary leaders speak out about 
it. We discuss the role of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and how when the Fed 
Chairman speaks, the markets listen.
Understanding how the economy works isn’t the only fundamental analysis 
tool that’s important to you. You also need to read financial statements to 
understand the financial status of the companies you want to buy. We delve 
into financial statements in Chapter 6.

16
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
A company’s income statements, on the other hand, give you a look at the 
results of the most recent period and provide a basis for comparison with 
prior years and periods. You can use these statements to look at whether 
revenues are growing, and if they are, by what percentage. You also can see 
how much profit the company is keeping from the revenue it generates. The 
cash flow statement shows you how efficiently a company is using its cash 
and whether it’s having problems meeting its current obligations. The 
balance sheet gives you a snapshot of a company’s assets and liabilities and 
stockholder’s equity.
You can use this information to develop your own estimate of a company’s 
growth and profit potential. In Chapter 6, we show you how to do a few 
basic ratio calculations that you can use to compare similar stocks and then 
choose the one with the best potential.
 
Analysts use this information to project a company’s financial growth and 
profits. You never should depend entirely on what analysts say, but you 
always should do your own research and collect the opinions of numerous 
analysts. One of the best ways to find out what analysts are saying and what 
aspects of the financial statements may raise a red flag is the analyst call. In 
Chapter 7, we explain how you can listen in on these calls and understand the 
unique language used in them to make better choices when selecting stocks. 
We also discuss the pros and cons of using analyst reports.
Getting a Grip on Technical Analysis
You use fundamental analysis to determine what part of the business cycle 
the economy is in and what industries offer the best growth potential. Then 
you use that information to select the best target companies and identify 
prices at which you’d want to buy their stocks.
After choosing your targets, you then use technical analysis to follow trends 
in the prices of the target stocks, so you can find the right time to get in and 
ultimately to get out of a stock position. These targets become part of your 
stock-watch list. After you’ve established that list, you then use the tools of 
technical analysis to make your trades.
In Chapter 8, we introduce you to the basics of technical analysis, how it 
works, and how it needs to be used. Although some people think of technical 
analysis as no more than fortune-telling, others believe it yields significant 
information that can help you make successful trades. We obviously believe 
that technical analysis provides you with extensive tools for your trading 
success, and we show you how to use those tools to be profitable.

17
 Chapter 1: The Ups and Downs of Trading Stocks
Your first step in technical analysis is finding out how to create a chart. We 
focus on the most popular type — bar charting. In Chapter 9, you discover 
the art of deciphering simple visual stock patterns and how to distinguish 
between trends and trading ranges, all so you’re able to spot when a stock 
moves from a trading range into either an upward or downward trend and 
know when you need to act.
In Chapter 10, we show you how to use your newfound skill of identifying 
trends to locate areas of support and resistance within a trend that ultimately 
help you find the right times to make your move. You find out how to read 
the patterns in the charts to identify trading signals and what to do whenever 
you’ve acted on a failed trading signal.
Chapter 11 fills you in on moving averages and how to use them to identify 
trends. You also find out about oscillators and other indicators that traders 
use for recognizing trading signals. As a newbie trader, you’ll probably find 
that your greatest risk is paralysis of analysis. That’s where you may find 
that you’re having so much fun reading the charts or are just so confused 
about which chart has the right signal that you feel paralyzed by the variety 
of choices. We show you how to create and use a tiny subset of tools that is 
available in today’s charting software packages to simplify your life and make 
your choices easier. You’ll likewise discover how to use such odd-sounding 
but critical tools as an MACD indicator or a stochastic oscillator, and we help 
you take advantage of the powerful concept of relative strength.
Putting Trading Strategy into Practice
After you get used to using the tools, it’s time to put your new skills into 
practice making money. In Chapter 13, we show you how to put your newfound 
affinities for fundamental analysis and technical analysis together to develop 
and build your trading strategy. Using fundamental analysis, you can
 
✓ Determine which part of the economic cycle is driving the market.
 
✓ Determine which sector makes the most sense for stock trading.
 
✓ Figure out which sectors are in the best positions to go up.
 
✓ Find out which stocks are leading in the ascending sectors.
 
✓ Evaluate where the Fed stands on the economy and which potential 
moves by the Fed can impact the strength of the market.
 
✓ Evaluate and hopefully anticipate potential shocks to the market. 
Although doing so may seem like gazing into a crystal ball, you really 
can pick up some signs by checking out the key economic indicators. We 
show you what they are.

18
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
After you complete your fundamental analysis, we show you how to use 
your new technical analysis skills successfully. Using them, you find out how 
you can
 
✓ Trade within the overall technical conditions.
 
✓ Confirm which economic cycle a market is in by using index charts.
 
✓ Determine whether an ascending sector is stuck in a range or ready to 
enter a new upward trend.
 
✓ Determine whether leading stocks are stuck in ranges or ready to break 
out in upward trends.
Finally, we show you how to use your newfound skills to manage risk, set up 
a stop-loss position, and choose your time frame for trading.
After honing your skills, you’re ready to start trading. So in Chapter 14, we 
focus on the actual mechanics of trading by
 
✓ Discussing how to enter or trade into a position
 
✓ Explaining bid and ask prices
 
✓ Discussing the risks of market orders
 
✓ Explaining how to use limit and stop orders
We also explore how to exit or trade out of a position and still stay unattached 
emotionally, when to take your profits, and how to minimize your losses, in 
addition to discussing potential tax hits and how to minimize them.
Now that you know how to research the fundamentals, effectively use 
the technical tools, and mechanically carry out a trade, the next step is 
developing and managing your own trading system. We explore the basic 
steps to developing the system, which include
 
1. Designing and keeping a trading log.
 
2. Identifying reliable trading patterns.
 
3. Developing an exit strategy.
 
4. Determining whether you’ll use discretionary trading methods or 
mechanical trading. We explore the pros and cons of each.
 
5. Deciding whether to develop your own trading system or buy one of 
the ones available off the shelf.
 
6. Testing your trading systems and understanding their limitations 
before making a major financial commitment to your new system.

19
 Chapter 1: The Ups and Downs of Trading Stocks
We also discuss assessing your results and fixing any problems.
After you’ve designed, built, and tested your system, you’re ready to jump in 
with both feet. The key to getting started: Make sure you begin with a small 
sum of money, examining your system and then increasing your trading 
activity as you gain experience and develop confidence with the system that 
you develop.
Trading at Higher Risk
Some traders decide they want to take on a greater level of risk by practicing 
methods of swing trading or day trading or by delving into the areas of 
trading derivatives or foreign currency. Although all of these alternatives are 
valid trading options, we steer clear of explaining even the basics of how to 
use these high-risk trading alternatives, and instead, we provide you with a 
general understanding of the ways these trading alternatives work and the 
risks that are unique to each of them.
If you decide, however, that you want to take on these additional risks, 
don’t depend on the information in this book to get started. Use the general 
information that we offer you here to determine what additional training you 
need to feel confident before moving into these trading arenas.
Remember: Have Fun!
Although you are without question considering the work of a trader for the 
money you can make, you need to enjoy the game of trading. If you find that 
you’re having trouble sleeping at night because of the risks you’re taking, 
then trading may not be worth all the heartache. You may need to put off 
your decision to enter the world of trading until you’re more comfortable 
with the risks or until you’ve designed a system that better accommodates 
your risk tolerance.
You may find that you need to take a slower approach by putting less money 
into your trades. You don’t need to make huge profits with your early trades. 
Just trading into and out of a position without losing any money may be a 
good goal for you when you’re just starting out. If you notice your position 
turning toward the losing side, knowing that you can trade your way out of 
it before you take a big loss may help you build greater confidence in your 
abilities.

20
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Remember, making a losing trade doesn’t mean that you’re a loser. Even the 
most experienced traders must at times face losses. The key to successful 
trading is knowing when to get out before your portfolio takes a serious hit. 
On the other side of that coin, you also need to know how to get out when 
you’re in a winning or profitable position. When you’re trying to ride a trend 
all the way to the top, it sometimes starts bottoming out so fast that you lose 
some or possibly even all of your profits, causing you to end up in a losing 
position.
Trading is a skill that takes a long time to develop and is perfected only after 
you make mistakes and celebrate successes. Enjoy the roller coaster ride!

the Stock Exchanges
In This Chapter

B
illions of shares of stock trade in the United States every day, and each 
trader is looking to get his or her small piece of that action. Before 
moving into the specifics of how to trade, we first want to introduce you not 
only to the world of stock trading, but also to trading in other key markets — 
futures, options, and bonds. In this chapter, we also explain differences and 
similarities among key stock exchanges and how those factors impact your 
trading options. After providing you with a good overview of the key markets, 
we delve into the different types of orders you can place with each of the key 
exchanges.
Introducing the Broad Markets
You may think the foundation of the United States economy resides inside 
Fort Knox where the country holds its billions of dollars in gold, or possibly 
that it resides in our political center, Washington, D.C. But nope. The country’s 
true economic center is Wall Street, where billions of dollars change hands 
each and every day, thousands of companies are traded, and millions of 
people’s lives are affected.
Stocks are not the only things sold in the broad financial markets. Every 
day, futures, options, and bonds also are traded. Although we focus on 
stock exchanges in this chapter, we first need to briefly explain each type of 
market.

22
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Stock markets
The stocks of almost every major U.S. corporation and many major foreign 
corporations are traded on a stock exchange in the United States each day, 
and none of the money involved in these trades goes directly into the 
companies being traded. Today numerous local and international stock 
exchanges trade stocks in publicly held corporations; moreover, the only 
major corporations not traded are those held privately — usually by families 
or original founding partners that chose not to sell shares on the public 
market. Forbes magazine’s top privately held corporations are Cargill, Koch 
Industries, Chrysler, GMAC, Price Waterhouse Coopers, and Mars. Many of 
the large private corporations that are not traded publicly do have provisions 
for employee ownership of stock and must report earnings to the SEC, so 
they straddle the line of public versus private corporations.
A share of stock is actually a portion of ownership in a given company. Few 
stockholders own large enough stakes in a company to play a major decision-
making role. Instead, stockholders purchase stocks, hoping that their invest-
ments rise in price, so that those stocks can be sold at a profit some time in 
the future.
For the majority of this chapter, we focus on the three top stock exchanges 
in the United States: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ (the 
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system), and 
the American Stock Exchange (Amex). We also introduce you to the evolving 
world of electronic communication networks (ECNs) on which you can trade 
stocks directly, thus bypassing brokers.
Futures markets
Futures trading actually started in Japan in the 18th century to trade rice and 
silk. This trading instrument was first used in the United States in the 1850s 
for trading grains and other agricultural entities. Basically, futures trading 
means establishing a financial contract in which you try to predict the future 
value of a commodity that must be delivered at a specific time in the future. 
Yup, if you had a working crystal ball, it would be very useful here. This type 
of trading is done on a commodities exchange. The largest such exchange in 
the United States today is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Commodities 
include any product that can be bought and sold. Oil, cotton, and minerals 
are just a few of the products sold on a commodities exchange.

23
 Chapter 2: Exploring the Markets and the Stock Exchanges
 
Futures contracts must have a seller (usually the person producing the 
commodity — a farmer or oil refinery, for example) and a buyer (usually a 
company that actually uses the commodity). You also can speculate on either 
side of the contract, basically meaning:
 
✓ When you buy a futures contract, you’re agreeing to buy a commodity 
that is not yet ready for sale or hasn’t yet been produced at a set price 
at a specific time in the future.
 
✓ When you sell a futures contact, you’re agreeing to provide a commodity 
that is not yet ready for sale or hasn’t yet been produced at a set price 
at a specific time in the future.
The futures contract states the price at which you agree to pay for or sell a 
certain amount of this future product when it’s delivered at a specific future 
date. Although most futures contracts are based on a physical commodity, 
the highest volume futures contracts are based on the future value of stock 
indexes and other financially related futures.
Unless you’re a commercial consumer who plans to use the commodity, you 
won’t actually take delivery of or provide the commodity for which you’re 
trading a futures contract. You’ll more than likely sell the futures contract 
you bought before you actually have to accept the commodity from a 
commercial customer. Futures contracts are used as financial instruments by 
producers, consumers, and speculators. We cover more about those players 
and futures contracts in much greater depth in Chapter 18.
Bond markets
Bonds are actually loan instruments. Companies sell bonds to borrow cash. If 
you buy a bond, you’re essentially holding a company’s debt or the debt of a 
governmental entity. The company or government entity that sells the bond 
agrees to pay you a certain amount of interest for a specific period of time in 
exchange for the use of your money. The big difference between stocks and 
bonds is that bonds are debt obligations and stocks are equity. Stockholders 
actually own a share of the corporation. Bondholders lend money to the 
company with no right of ownership. Bonds, however, are considered 
safer, because if a company files bankruptcy, bondholders are paid before 
stockholders. Bonds are a safety net and not actually a part of the trading 
world for individual position traders, day traders, and swing traders. While 
a greater dollar volume of bonds is traded each day, the primary traders for 
this venue are large institutional traders. We want to mention them here but 
don’t discuss them any further in this book.

24
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Options markets
An option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, 
either to buy or to sell the underlying asset upon which the option is based 
at a specified price on or before a specified date. Sometime before the option 
period expires, a purchaser of an option must decide whether to exercise 
the option and buy (or sell) the asset (most commonly stocks) at the target 
price. Options also are called derivatives. We talk more about this investment 
alternative in Chapter 18.
Reviewing Stock Exchanges
Most of this book covers stock trading, so we obviously concentrate on how 
the key exchanges — NYSE, NASDAQ, and Amex — operate and how these 
operations impact your trading activity.
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
The U.S. stock market actually dates back to May 17, 1792, when 24 brokers 
signed an agreement under a buttonwood tree at what today is 58 Wall Street. 
The 24 brokers specifically agreed to sell shares of companies among them-
selves, charging a commission or fee to buy and sell shares for others who 
wanted to invest in a company. Yup, the first American stockbrokers were 
born that day.
A formalized exchange didn’t come into existence until March 8, 1817, when 
the brokers adopted a formal constitution and named their new entity the 
New York Stock & Exchange Board. Brokers actually operated outdoors until 
1860, when the operations finally were moved inside. The first stock ticker 
was introduced in 1867, but it wasn’t until 1869 that the NYSE started requiring 
the registration of securities for companies that wanted to have their stock 
traded on the exchange. Registration began as a means of preventing the 
over-issuance (selling too many shares) of a company’s stock.
From these meager beginnings, the NYSE built itself into the largest stock 
exchange in the world with many of the largest companies listed on the 
exchange. Trading occurs on the floor of the exchange, with specialists and 
floor traders running the show. Today these specialists and floor traders work 
electronically, which first became possible when the exchange introduced 
electronic capabilities for trading in 2004. For traders, the new electronic 

25
 Chapter 2: Exploring the Markets and the Stock Exchanges
trading capabilities are a more popular tool than working with specialists and 
floor traders. Electronic trading capabilities were enhanced when the NYSE 
merged with Archipelago Holdings in 2006. The exchange expanded its global 
trading capabilities after a merger with Euronext in 2007, which made trading 
in European stocks much easier.
 
You may not realize just how much the concept of supply and demand 
influences the trading price of a stock. Price swings of a stock frequently are 
caused by shifts in the supply of shares available for sale and the demand 
created by the number of buyers wanting to purchase available shares.
The specialist
Specialists — whose title may change to designated market makers soon — 
buffer dramatic swings when news about a company breaks. If news that 
has a major impact on a stock’s price breaks, specialists buy shares or sell 
the ones they hold in a company to make the trend toward a higher or lower 
stock price more orderly. For example, if good news breaks, creating more 
demand for the stock and overwhelming existing supply, the specialist becomes 
a seller of the stock to minimize the impact of a major price increase by 
increasing supply. The same is true when bad news strikes, creating a 
situation in which having more sellers than buyers drives the stock price 
down. In that situation, the specialist becomes a buyer of the stock, easing 
the impact of the drop in price.
The floor trader
The guys you see on the floor of the stock exchange, waving their hands 
wildly to make trades, are the floor traders. They’re actually members of the 
NYSE who trade exclusively for their own accounts. Floor traders also can act 
as a floor broker for others and sell their services.
The specialist’s book
You may wonder how a specialist keeps track of all this information. That 
one’s easy: The specialist records all trades and quotation changes in the 
specialist’s order book. Any questions that arise about trading activities can 
be researched using this book.
Open outcry
The NYSE still uses what is becoming an outdated method of trading called 
open outcry, in which stocks are sold like a public auction with verbal bids 
and offers shouted at the trading post. These trading posts are centered on 
the specialist’s location for particular stocks. Other exchanges exclusively 
use computer-based network systems for trading.

26
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
The NYSE is the last big stock exchange to use open outcry, but even here it 
is taking a backseat to automated execution. Only a tiny fraction of trades are 
handled through open outcry. Except for a small group of very high-priced 
stocks, almost everything can be handled immediately by electronic execution.
NYSE Hybrid Market
The New York Stock Exchange uses the Hybrid Market program to integrate 
the best aspects of the open outcry or auction market with electronic trading. 
Most NYSE trades are now handled electronically, but brokers can still 
choose to route customer orders to the floor for open-outcry trading.
NASDAQ
NASDAQ, which stands for the National Association of Securities Dealers 
Automated Quotations, is the fastest-growing stock market today. The market 
was formed after an SEC study in the early 1960s concluded that the sale 
of over-the-counter (OTC) securities, in other words securities that aren’t 
traded on the existing stock exchanges, was fragmented and obscure. The 
report called for the automation of the OTC market and gave the responsibility 
for implementing that system to the National Association of Securities 
Dealers (NASD).
The NASD began construction of the NASDAQ system in 1968, and its first 
trades were made beginning February 8, 1971, when NASDAQ became the 
world’s first electronic stock market.
Market makers
Unlike the specialist structure of the NYSE, in which one specialist represents 
a particular stock, NASDAQ market makers compete with each other to buy 
and sell the stocks they choose to represent. More than 500 member firms 
act as market makers for NASDAQ. All market makers are members of the 
NASD. Each uses its own capital, research, and system resources to represent 
a stock and compete with other market makers.
Market makers compete for customers’ orders by displaying buy and sell 
quotations on an electronic exchange for a guaranteed number of shares 
at a specific price. After market makers receive orders, they immediately 
purchase or sell stock from their own inventories or seek out the other side 
of the trades so they can be executed, usually in a matter of seconds. The 
four types of market makers are

27
 Chapter 2: Exploring the Markets and the Stock Exchanges
 
✓ Retail market makers: They serve institutional and individual investors 
through brokerage networks that provide a continuous flow of orders 
and sales opportunities.
 
✓ Wholesale market makers: They serve primarily institutional clients 
and other brokers or dealers who aren’t registered market makers in 
a particular company’s stock but who need to execute orders for their 
customers.
 
✓ Institutional market makers: They execute large block orders for 
institutional investors, such as pension funds, mutual funds, insurance 
companies, and asset management companies.
 
✓ Regional market makers: They serve companies and individuals of a 
particular region. By focusing regionally, these market makers offer their 
customers more extensive coverage of the stocks and investors in a 
particular area of the country.
NASDAQ continues to be the leader in electronic trading. Its system, called 
the NASDAQ Crossing Network, enables fully anonymous trade execution to 
minimize the market impact of trading.
Over-the-counter and bulletin-board stocks
Stocks that do not meet the minimum requirements to be listed on NASDAQ 
are traded as over-the-counter or bulletin-board stocks (OTCBB). The OTCBB is 
a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices, 
and volume information for the stocks traded OTCBB. These stocks generally 
don’t meet the listing qualifications for NASDAQ or other national securities 
exchanges, and fewer than two (and sometimes zero) market makers trade in 
these stocks, making buying and selling them more difficult.
Amex
When the NYSE moved indoors, some stocks still weren’t good enough to be 
sold on the exchange. Those stocks were called curb traders and ultimately 
made up what became known as the American Stock Exchange (Amex), 
which moved indoors in 1921. Amex lists stocks that are smaller in size than 
those on the NYSE yet still have a national following. Many firms that first list 
on Amex work to meet the listing requirements of the NYSE and then switch 
over.
The Amex trading system was integrated into the NYSE trading system after 
the merger with the NYSE was completed in 2008. It is now called the NYSE 
Alternext US, and trades small-company stocks.

28
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Electronic communications 
networks (ECNs)
Many traders look for ways to get around dealing with a traditional broker. 
Instead they access trades using a direct-access broker. We talk more about 
the differences in Chapter 3. A new system of electronic trading that is devel-
oping is called the electronic communications network (ECN).
ECNs enable buyers and sellers to meet electronically to execute trades. 
The trades are entered into the ECN systems by market makers at one of the 
exchanges or by an OTC market maker. Transactions are completed without 
a broker-dealer, saving users the cost of commissions normally charged for 
more traditional forms of trading.
Subscribers to ECNs include retail investors, institutional investors, market 
makers, and broker-dealers. ECNs are accessed through a custom terminal 
or by direct Internet dial-up. Orders are posted by the ECN for subscribers to 
view. The ECN then matches orders for execution. In most cases, buyers and 
sellers maintain their anonymity and do not list identifiable information in 
their buy or sell orders.
In the last few years ECNs have gone through consolidation, and there are 
only two independent ECNs left. The two independent ECNs, Instinet and 
Bloomberg Tradebook, primarily service the institutional marketplace. If you 
want to trade through Instinet, you can do so as part of its partnership with 
E*Trade. Archipelago now operates under the HYSE umbrella as HYSE Arca 
Options.
Listing requirements
NASDAQ has the easiest minimum list-
ing requirements of all the broad-market 
exchanges, followed by the NYSE Alternext US 
(formerly Amex). The New York Stock Exchange 
(NYSE) has the toughest requirements to meet 
for companies to be listed. In addition to listing 
requirements, companies on the exchanges 
must conform to certain rules, including pub-
lishing quarterly reports, soliciting proxies, and 
publicly announcing developments that may 
affect the value of the securities.

29
 Chapter 2: Exploring the Markets and the Stock Exchanges
Understanding Order Types
Buying a share of stock can be as easy as calling a broker and saying that you 
want to buy such and such a stock — but you can place an order in a number 
of other ways that give you better protections. Most orders are placed as day 
orders, but you can choose to place them as good ’til canceled orders. The 
four basic types of orders you can place are market orders, limit orders, stop 
orders, and stop-limit orders.
Understanding the language and using it to protect your assets and the way 
you trade are critical to your success as a trader. The next few sections 
explain the nuances of placing orders so you don’t make a potentially costly 
mistake by placing a market order when you intended to place a limit order. 
Putting a stop-limit order in place may sound like the safest way to go; 
however, doing so may not help you in a rapidly changing market.
Market order
When you place a market order, you’re essentially telling a broker to buy 
or sell a stock at the current market price. A market order is the way your 
broker normally places an order unless you give him or her different 
instructions. The advantage of a market order is that you’re almost always 
guaranteed that your order is executed as long as willing buyers and sellers 
are in the marketplace. Generally speaking, buy orders are filled at the ask 
price and sell orders are filled at the bid price. If, however, you’re working 
with a broker who has a smart-order routing system, which looks for the best 
bid/ask prices, you sometimes can get a better price on the NASDAQ or Amex 
exchanges. Whenever the order involves the NYSE, you need a good floor 
broker. In most brokerage houses, market orders are the cheapest to place 
with the lowest commission level.
 
The disadvantage of a market order is that you’re stuck paying the price when 
the order is executed — possibly not at the price you expected when you 
placed the order. Brokers and real-time quote services quote you prices, but 
because the markets move fast, with deals taking place in seconds, you’ll 
probably find that the price you’re quoted rarely is the same as the execution 
price. Whenever you place a market order, especially if you’re seeking a large 
number of shares, the probability is even greater that you’ll receive different 
prices for parts of the order — 100 shares at $25 and 100 shares at $25.05, for 
example.

30
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Limit order
If you want to avoid buying or selling stock at a price higher or lower than 
you intend, you must place a limit order instead of a market order. When 
placing a limit order, you specify the price at which you’ll buy or sell. You 
can place either a buy limit order or a sell limit order. Buy limit orders can 
be executed only when a seller is willing to sell the stock you’re buying at the 
limit price or lower. A sell limit order can be executed only when a buyer is 
willing to pay your limit price or higher. In other words, you set the parameters 
for the price that you’ll accept. You can’t do that with a market order.
The risk that you take when placing a limit order is that the order may never 
be filled. For example, a hot stock piques your interest when it is selling for 
$10, so you decide to place a limit order to buy the stock at $10.50. By the 
time you call your broker or input the order into your trading system, the 
price already has moved above $10.50 and never drops back to that level, 
thus your order won’t be filled. On the good side, if the stock is so hot that 
its price skyrockets to $75, you also won’t be stuck as the owner of the stock 
after purchasing near the $75 high. That high will likely be a temporary top 
that quickly drops back to reality, forcing you to sell the stock at a significant 
loss at some point in the future.
 
Most firms charge more for executing a limit order than they do for a market 
order. Be sure that you understand the fee and commission structures if you 
intend to use limit orders.
Stop order
You may also consider placing your order as a stop order, which means 
that whenever the stock reaches a price that you specify, it automatically 
becomes a market order. Investors who buy using a stop order usually do 
so to limit potential losses or protect a profit. Buy stop orders are always 
entered at a stop price that is above the current market price.
When placing a sell stop order, you do so to avoid further losses or to 
protect a profit that exists in case the stock continues on a downward trend. 
The stop price is always placed below the current market price. For example, 
when you have a stock that you bought for $10 that now is selling for $25, 
you can decide to protect most of that profit by placing a sell stop order that 
specifies that stock be sold when the market price falls to $20, thus cementing 
a $10 gain.
You don’t have to watch the stock market every second; instead, when 
the market price drops to $20, your stop order automatically switches to a 
market order and is executed.

31
 Chapter 2: Exploring the Markets and the Stock Exchanges
The big disadvantage of a stop order is that if for some reason the stock 
market gets a shock during the news day that affects all stocks, it can 
temporarily send prices lower, activating your stop price. If it turns out that 
the downturn is actually merely a short-term fluctuation and not an indication 
that the stock you hold is a bad choice or that you risk losing your profit, 
your stock may sell before you ever have time to react.
 
The bottom can fall out of your stock’s pricing. After your stop price is 
reached, a stop order automatically becomes a market order and the price 
that you actually receive can differ greatly from your stop price, especially in a 
rapidly fluctuating market. You can avoid this problem by placing a stop-limit 
order, which we discuss in the next section.
 
Stop orders are not officially supported on the NASDAQ. However, most brokers 
offer a service to simulate a stop order. If you want to enter a stop order for a 
NASDAQ stock, your broker must watch the market and enter the market or 
limit order you designate as a stop when the stock reaches your specified sale 
price. Some broker-dealers won’t accept a stop order on some securities and 
almost never accept a stop order for OTC stocks. If you intend to use stop 
orders, make sure that you
 
✓ Check with the brokers you’re planning to use to ensure that they 
accept stop orders.
 
✓ Find out what your brokers charge for stop orders.
 
✓ Review how your brokers’ stop orders work, so you don’t run into 
surprises.
After all, you don’t want to execute a stop order and end up selling a stock 
that you didn’t intend to sell or at a price you find unacceptable.
Stop-limit order
You can protect yourself from any buying or selling surprises by placing a 
stop-limit order. This type of order combines the features of both a stop order 
and a limit order. When your stop price is reached, the stop order becomes a 
limit order rather than a market order.
A stop-limit order gives you the most control over the price at which you will 
trade your stock. You can avoid a purchase or sale of your stock at a price 
that differs significantly from what you intend. But you do risk the possibility 
that the stop-limit order may never be executed, which can happen in fast-
moving markets where prices fluctuate wildly.
For example, you may find that deploying stop-limit orders is particularly 
dangerous to your portfolio, especially when bad news breaks about a stock 
you’re holding and its price drops rapidly. Although you have a stop-limit 

32
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
order in place, and the stop price is met, the movement in the market may 
happen so rapidly that the price limit you set can be missed. In this case, the 
limit side of the order actually prevents the sale of the stock and you risk 
riding it all the way down until you change your order. For example, say you 
purchased a stock at $8 near its peak. On the day the company’s CEO and 
CFO were fired, the stock dropped to $4.05. You may have had a stop-limit 
order in place to sell at $5, but on the day of the firing, the price dropped so 
rapidly after the company announced the firing that your stop-limit order 
could not be filled at your limit price.
 
Stop-limit orders, like stop orders, are more commonly used when trading on 
an exchange than in an OTC market. Broker-dealers likewise can limit the 
securities on which stop-limit orders can be placed. If you want to use stop-
limit orders, be sure to review the rules with your broker before trying to 
execute them.
Good ’til canceled orders
You can avoid having to replace an order time and again by using a good ’til 
canceled (GTC) order. GTC orders are placed at a limit price and last until 
the order actually is executed or you decide to cancel it. A GTC order won’t 
be executed until the limit price is reached, regardless of how many days or 
weeks it takes.
You can choose to use this type of order whenever you want to set a limit 
price that differs significantly from the current market price. Many brokerage 
firms limit how much time a GTC can remain in place, and most of them 
charge more for executing this type of order.
Other order types
Less commonly used order methods include contingent, all-or-none, and 
fill-or-kill orders. Contingent orders are placed on the contingency that 
another one of your stock holdings is sold before the order is placed. An 
all-or-none order specifies that all the shares of a stock be bought according 
to the terms indicated or none of the stock should be purchased. A fill-or-kill 
order must be filled immediately upon placement or killed.

A
s an individual, you can’t trade stocks — or bonds, or options, or 
futures — unless you have a broker or are a broker yourself. That 
doesn’t mean, however, that you have to work with a human being to trade 
stocks. Online brokers and direct-access brokers enable you to make trades 
electronically, so you never have to speak with a human being unless you’re 
having a technical problem.
The differences between brokers are based on prices, services, and special 
capabilities. High-volume swing traders and day traders typically require the 
services of a direct-access broker, while position traders can and do trade 
successfully with more traditional discount, online, and full-service brokers. 
In this chapter, we help you understand the brokerage options that are 
available, the types of accounts you can establish, and the basic trading rules 
you must follow.
Why You Need a Broker
Unless you plan to get your brokerage license from the National Association 
of Securities Dealers (NASD) and set up shop yourself (which is hard — and 
expensive — to do), you need to work with a broker to be able to buy and sell 
stocks. How you choose a broker is based on the level of individual services 
you want. The more services you want, the more you pay for your ability to 
trade.

34
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
As an individual, you open your account with a brokerage house, but if you 
work with a human being, that person is considered a broker. Brokerage 
houses or brokerage services are also usually referred to as brokers for 
short. Actually there are many levels of brokers, which we cover in greater 
detail in Chapter 20 when we talk about licensing.
On one side of the spectrum is the full-service broker who does a lot of 
hand-holding and offers stock research and advice and other human-based 
services. When using a full-service broker, you pay a significant commission 
for each stock trade. In the middle are discount brokers that offer fewer 
services, but charge less per trade. On the opposite side of the equation 
are direct-access brokers, who offer few human-based services and instead 
provide extensive trading platforms so you can trade electronically and 
access the stock exchange systems directly on a real-time basis.
Exploring Types of Brokers 
and Brokerage Services
Before you can pick the type of broker that best fulfills your needs, you need 
to understand the kinds of services that each kind of broker provides. After 
you gain an understanding of your options and select the types of services 
you want, you then need to carefully research each of the brokers that match 
your needs. Within each classification are good and bad brokers. We give you 
the tools for researching brokerage firms in the sections that follow.
Full-service brokers
If you want someone to assist you with buying decisions and implementing 
those decisions, you need to check out the full-service brokers. They offer 
extensive research and other services. Usually, they call you with trading 
ideas. All you need to do is say yes or no. You pay a transaction fee for trades 
plus a commission percentage based on the dollar volume. You can invest in 
stocks, futures, options, bonds, mutual funds, money market funds, and 
variable annuities. You can work with a full-service broker by telephone, 
mail, fax, or using an Internet connection. Most have Web sites you can 
access online for information, and many allow you to enter your own trades.

35
 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Brokerage Options
For example, here is the transaction fee schedule for one of the better-known 
full-service brokers (others can be as much as twice as high):
Transaction Size
Commission Rate
$0–$2,499
$40 plus 1.7% of principal
$2,500–$6,249
$65 plus 0.66% of principal
$6,250–$19,999
$85 plus 0.34% of principal
$20,000–$49,999
$115 plus 0.33% of principal
$50,000–$499,999
$170 plus 0.11% of principal
$500,000+
$270 plus 0.09% of principal
Minimum broker-assisted trade — $54.95 per trade. Maximums are determined by transaction size.
Alternatively, some full-service brokers do permit you to make all the trades 
you want per year for a fee of 0.30 percent to 2.5 percent of the total assets in 
your brokerage account. Using language common to traders, that’s 30 to 250 
basis points. You have to have more than $10 million in an account to get the 
lowest fee. Traders with less than $100,000 pay closer to the 2.5 percent of 
assets to access the unlimited trading features.
 
Just because you choose to use a full-service broker doesn’t mean you can just 
sit back and let your money grow after placing it into an account. Brokers make 
money on commissions for the exchange of stocks. If they have no transactions 
during a given month, they don’t get paid. Unscrupulous brokers recommend 
trades to their customers to generate new commissions even when those 
decisions are not necessarily the best investment advice for their clients.
Even the research arms of many full-service brokerage houses have come 
under scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the 
past few years, primarily because their analysts didn’t accurately reflect 
the values of stocks in companies that used the firms’ investment-banking 
capabilities. Analysts tend to see their firms’ clients through rose-colored 
glasses when providing research reports, especially when their firms make a 
lot of money by providing investment-banking services to those companies.
 
Just because you choose to work through a full-service broker doesn’t mean 
you can sidestep doing your own research. You always need to perform due 
diligence, independently researching your stock purchases. Although you 
certainly can use the research arm of your brokerage firm, it shouldn’t be your 
sole source of research on any stock you’re thinking about buying or that you 
already hold.

36
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
If you’re planning to be a trader, do your own research and implement your 
own trading strategies. Why pay for the services of a full-service broker? We 
really don’t recommend that you waste your money on the additional costs 
of maintaining a full-service brokerage account or paying the high transaction 
fees and commissions.
Discount brokers
Many discount brokers offer the same services as full-service brokers, 
including research. The big exception is that you won’t get individual attention 
or unsolicited advice on what to buy or sell. Some discount brokers send out 
monthly newsletters with stock recommendations; most don’t trade futures 
or sell variable annuities. You can access a discount broker by telephone, 
mail, fax, or using an Internet connection. In order to get the lowest fees on 
trades, you need to do your own trades by accessing the broker’s Web site.
The big difference to you, as an individual trader, is that you can save a lot 
of money on trading costs, provided you know what you’re doing and you 
understand the language of stock trading. Transaction fees for online trades 
can range from as low as $5 up to about $30 with a discount broker. If you 
want special services requiring a broker’s assistance, you can work with a 
human being. Depending on the discount brokerage firm and the level of 
service required, fees can range from $25 to $50 per trade. Some discount 
brokers provide broker-assisted trades using a commission rate schedule 
similar to the ones offered by full-service brokers, but for lower fees per 
trade. If you get involved in more complicated trading transactions that 
require human assistance, costs can rise significantly. Anytime you’re 
planning to use a broker’s assistance, be sure you understand any additional 
costs that may be charged to your account for that assistance.
Direct-access brokers
If you want to bypass the traditional brokers and trade directly through an 
exchange or market maker, you need to open your account with a direct-access 
broker so you can use one or more of the electronic communications 
networks (ECNs) to make your trades. Traders usually download software 
onto their PCs so they can access the ECN directly using their Internet 
connections.
Traders using direct-access brokers typically get real-time Nasdaq Level I 
quotes, which show the latest bid and ask prices, quote size, the last trade, 
and volume.

37
 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Brokerage Options
Direct-access brokers also offer Nasdaq Level II. Nasdaq fees are higher for 
Level II, and the brokerage may also charge an additional fee for this type 
of access. In addition to what you see in a Level I quote, you also find the 
number of market makers participating in the market for any one stock.
A Nasdaq Level II quote screen shows the best bid price and the best ask 
price for specific stocks from participating market makers. All the bid and ask 
prices are ranked from best to worst. Some direct-access brokers combine 
Nasdaq Level II information and ECN book data to show the complete market 
depth for a specific stock. The ECN book is not a printed book like you would 
expect to find on a bookstore shelf. It’s a compilation of all the trades and 
the bid and ask quotes available on all the electronic networks. Examples of 
Level I and Level II quote screens are shown in Chapter 14.
Traders can review the quotes and select which market maker or ECN to use 
for each transaction. Most full-service and discount brokers make that choice 
for you when you’re working with them. A few discount brokers are providing 
access to ECNs.
 
When working with direct-access brokers, one key difference is that the 
software you use may reside on your own computer and not on your broker’s 
server, which greatly accelerates the speed at which you can trade. Again, 
some discount brokers provide software to enable you to receive direct raw 
data on your home computer, but their software is not as sophisticated as 
what direct-access brokers have to offer. Software issues are covered in detail 
in Chapter 4.
 
We often talk about how you can miss trading at the prices you want, especially 
in fast-moving markets. Well, having direct access doesn’t guarantee that 
you won’t miss a price, but your chances of catching those prices are better, 
because you won’t have to wait for pages to download from your broker’s 
server. Of course, for this advantage to work for you, you must have high-
speed Internet access, which can include DSL, cable, or satellite access.
Working with a direct-access broker gives you a steady stream of raw financial 
data — the actual trades, current bid and ask prices, trading volume, and 
market statistics. The trading software that you load onto your computer 
determines how this data is organized and presented on your computer 
monitor. Providing better access is how direct-access brokers distinguish 
their services from other brokers.
Software prices and access fees vary greatly and can cost you as much as 
$300 per month. The fees sometimes can be waived, especially if your trading 
volume is high enough — typically about 50 or more trades per month. As 
you can see, you have to make regular trades for a direct-access broker to be 
more cost effective than a discount broker. That said, even some discount 
brokers offer limited direct access using less-sophisticated software.

38
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Proprietary trading firms
Proprietary (or “prop”) trading firms enable traders to use at least some of 
the firm’s capital in addition to or instead of their own. Depending on the firm, 
traders share the gains and may (or may not) share the losses. You can’t just 
walk in and expect to trade with one of these firms. You must have an NASD 
Series 7 license combined with a proven history of trading in the equity 
markets. Some proprietary trading firms may also require that you have a 
Series 55 and Series 63 license. Proprietary trading is definitely not an alternative 
for beginners. These firms train you in their respective trading styles.
Futures brokers
Unless you’re working with a full-service brokerage firm, you may have 
to open a separate account with a futures broker if you want to trade 
commodities or other types of futures. Futures brokers must be licensed by 
the NASD in a way that differs from stockbrokers. Many direct-access brokers 
provide futures brokerage services, but you will not always find them at a 
discount broker. We talk more about licensing in Chapter 20 and about 
trading futures in Chapter 18.
Services You Should Consider 
When Choosing Your Broker
You can’t choose your broker purely on the basis of price. You need to know 
what types of services are offered to enable you to make the types of trades 
you want to make. When researching brokers, check out the types of orders 
supported, whether they can offer you a data feed, what types of charts they 
provide, and whether they can give you ECN access if you want to make your 
own trades electronically.
Types of orders supported
As we mention in Chapter 2, not all brokers provide stop orders for OTC and 
Nasdaq trades. The Nasdaq has no facility for handling stop orders, so the 
broker must monitor your stop prices and enter either market or limit orders 
if your price is triggered. Although monitoring stop prices usually is done 
automatically, not all brokers offer the service. If you know you’ll be using 
stops with many of your trades, you need to find a broker who provides 
those services. Some discount brokers provide those services, provided 
you’re willing to pay for them.

39
 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Brokerage Options
As such, you also need to compare not only prices for those services but also 
the respective brokers’ reputations for effectively and efficiently providing 
those services. If you want to place contingent orders (see Chapter 2), you 
may discover that few discount brokers offer that service even for a price.
 
As you trade, you definitely need to steer clear of brokers who accept payment 
for order flow, a practice in which some exchanges or market makers pay 
brokerage firms for routing orders to them. Firms can make a penny or more 
per share, but the SEC requires the firm to inform you whether it receives 
payment for order flow when you first open an account and thereafter on an 
annual basis. Each time a firm receives a payment for order flow, it must 
disclose that information on the trade confirmation. If you see an indication 
on one of your trades that your broker received this type of payment, you 
have the right to request notification in writing about the source and type 
of payment related to that transaction. These payments may encourage 
unethical brokers to steer orders away from the best prices and toward the 
market maker offering such payments.
Data feed
The type of data to which you want to have access is crucial. Most brokers 
provide basic stock quotes, usually in real time, and some may even offer 
market data providing a much deeper look at the market that includes not 
only current sales information but also previous sales information. If you 
want access to a higher level of data, you need to be certain that you open 
your brokerage account with a firm that provides the level of data that you 
need, or you may buy it from a third party. Again, pricing for differing data 
feeds can vary among brokerage firms. Firms that offer you ways of getting 
this data feed through your home computer, as opposed to accessing it from 
their servers, charge more, but remember that you’ll receive the information 
quicker. The faster your Internet connection, the more quickly and reliably 
you will receive this information. We cover data feeds in greater detail in 
Chapter 4.
Charts
Data fed into your home computer is raw stock market data. How this 
information is formatted on your computer and the charts you’re able to 
build from it are dependent on the software that’s provided by your broker. 
Charting software can be critical to your ability to make trading decisions. 
Your broker may charge you to use the software, but will usually discount 
or waive the fee based on the size of your portfolio or your volume of trading 
activity. There are also many free charting alternatives available online, 
including StockCharts.com, which we used to produce the charts for this 
book. We talk about charting capabilities in Chapter 4.

40
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
ECN access
If direct access to stock exchanges and market makers is important to you, 
then you need to find a broker that provides ECN access. You don’t have to 
open an account through a direct-access broker; some discount brokers do 
provide ECN access. Be sure to check out the section on “Choosing the Right 
Broker for You,” later in this chapter.
Understanding the Types 
of Brokerage Accounts
You can open your brokerage accounts in a couple different ways — as a 
cash account or a margin account. If you open a margin account, you also 
must open a cash account. You also may open separate accounts for 
retirement savings. Because retirement accounts have more restrictions, 
your trading alternatives are more limited in those accounts, but that isn’t 
necessarily a bad thing. You shouldn’t be risking your retirement funds on 
speculative trading anyway.
Cash accounts
The traditional brokerage account is a cash account, which also is known 
as a Type 1 account. With a cash account, you must deposit the full cost of 
any purchases by the settlement date of the transaction. At many brokerage 
houses prior to 2002, you were permitted to place an order to buy stock even 
if the cash was not yet in your account. As long as the money was deposited 
within three days of the completion of the transaction, you could make the 
purchase. Today, however, few brokers give you that kind of flexibility. Most 
brokers require funds to buy stocks to be in your cash account before you 
can place an order. The amount of cash you need to have on deposit varies 
by broker; some let you open an account for as little as $100 or $1,000, but 
others require as much as $10,000 or more to open a new cash account.
Margin accounts
You don’t have to have as much cash on hand to buy stock when you open 
a margin account, which also is known as a Type 2 account. This type of 
account enables you to borrow certain amounts of money using cash or 
securities already in the account as collateral. Because using a margin 
account essentially is buying stocks, bonds, or commodities on credit, each 
respective brokerage firm has its own screening procedure to determine 
whether you qualify for the loan and can buy on margin.

41
 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Brokerage Options
The Federal Reserve requires a $2,000 minimum deposit to open a margin 
account, and it currently limits the amount you can borrow on margin to 50 
percent of the initial purchase price. Not all stocks can be bought on margin. 
Some brokerage firms enforce even stricter margin rules, especially if you 
choose to invest in volatile stocks. When buying stocks on margin, you 
pay an interest rate on the margin loans, but most brokerage firms charge 
relatively low rates to encourage the transaction business. Be sure to check 
out the “Margin requirements” section later in this chapter.
When opening a margin account, the firm also requires you to sign what’s 
called a hypothecation agreement, which stipulates regulations for the 
account and permits the broker to have a lien on your account whenever the 
balance in your account falls below the minimum maintenance margin (more 
about that in a moment). The agreement also enables your broker to loan 
your shares to short sellers. That’s where shorted stock comes from. We talk 
more about short selling and the mechanics of margin trading in Chapter 14.
 
You’re taking a risk by purchasing shares of stock with borrowed money and 
using shares you own as collateral. If your stock holdings fall in value below 
the minimum maintenance margin requirement, your broker can force you to 
sell stock you don’t want to sell and use other assets you may not want to use 
to cover the outstanding loan. The risks and regulations for using a margin 
account are described more fully in the section on margin requirements, 
found later in this chapter.
Options
If you want to trade options, your broker will require you to sign a special 
options agreement acknowledging that you understand the risks associated with 
trading options or derivative instruments. This practice became common 
after brokers were sued by some clients because they suffered huge losses 
when trading options and claimed they were unaware of the risks. The 
agreement protects the broker from being sued if you lose a lot of money, 
so you need to know what you’re doing when dealing with derivatives (see 
Chapter 18).
IRAs and other retirement accounts
IRAs and other accounts in which you’re saving for retirement — such as 
401(k)s or 403(b)s — sometimes allow you to trade options, but margin 
trading is not allowed at all. These limitations are for your protection to 
avoid risking major losses in your long-term investments that never should 
be put at such high levels of risk. The amount you can contribute each year 
to all retirement accounts is limited by the Internal Revenue Code.

42
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Although you may be able to find a brokerage firm that allows you to trade 
using options — puts and calls, which are a type of option (see Chapter 18) — 
you nevertheless risk penalties for certain trading activities that occur in 
your retirement account whenever the IRS determines the account is being 
used for trading purposes rather than long-term investing. Officially, the 
Internal Revenue Code prohibits the “IRA or Keogh Plan account holder 
from loaning money to the account. Likewise, the holder cannot guarantee 
borrowing by the account or cover its losses.” That’s why margin accounts, 
which entail a type of borrowing, are not allowed.
Because these accounts are either tax-free or tax-deferred, you can’t write 
off any losses in them against any gains from investments held outside of 
them — in other taxable accounts. In other words, you don’t have the same 
tax-planning choices with IRAs or retirement accounts to offset gains and 
losses. All money taken out of an IRA at retirement is taxed at your current 
income tax rate. This differs from stocks held outside an IRA. For these 
stocks, you can use stock losses to minimize the tax you might have to pay 
on stock gains. If you hold the stock for longer than a year, you are taxed 
based on the lower capital gains rate of 15 percent for most taxpayers (some 
low-income taxpayers qualify for a rate as low as 5 percent) rather than your 
higher current income tax rate, which can be as high as 35 percent for some 
taxpayers.
Here are some additional trading limitations of retirement accounts:
 
✓ Margin is not allowed: Using funds within a retirement account as 
collateral for trading on margin is not permitted. It’s against the law. 
You won’t find a broker that will permit you to place retirement funds in 
margin accounts.
 
✓ Short positions are prohibited: Speculative trading using short positions, 
which is a common trading strategy for futures contracts and widely 
used by experienced stock and bond traders, requires a margin account. 
When someone shorts a stock, he or she borrows the stock and sells it 
in the hope of buying it back later for less. Selling short requires the use 
of margin, and is therefore not permitted in a retirement account. We 
talk more about short selling in Chapter 14.
 
✓ Trading policies are more stringent: All brokers have more stringent 
trading policies for retirement accounts. Before you open a retirement 
account, check with your broker about their trading limitations to be 
sure they match your intentions for the account.
 
✓ Options trading may not be permitted: If you’re an experienced trader, 
you can find some brokerage firms that allow options trading in your 
retirement account. Not all types of options, however, can be traded 
in a retirement account. The ones that you most likely can trade are 
covered calls, long call and put positions, or cash-secured puts. We talk 
more about puts and calls in Chapter 18.

43
 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Brokerage Options
Choosing the Right Broker for You
Before beginning a search for the right broker, you must first decide what 
type of trader you want to be and what services you need. If you want to be 
a position trader, or one who trades infrequently, your best bet is either a 
full-service or a discount broker. Making the choice between full-service and 
discount brokers depends upon how independently you want to operate as 
a trader. If you want advice on your stock investing plans, you need to seek 
out a full-service broker, but we certainly don’t recommend this expensive 
option. Before risking your money on trading, however, you need to be 
comfortable enough with the language and mechanics of trading and how to 
conduct your own research. If you don’t need the services of a direct-access 
broker, your best bet is to select a discount broker.
Considering more than price
Your choice of brokers should be based on much more than who can offer 
you the cheapest price. Although price definitely is a factor in your selection 
of broker, it is one of many factors you need to consider. The most important 
factors are the services that your broker offers and how effective and efficient 
the broker is in carrying out those promised services. Look for brokers that 
offer smart order routing capabilities, but steer clear of the ones that accept 
payment for order flow (see the “Types of orders supported” section, earlier 
in this chapter).
You may find a brokerage firm that provides all the bells and whistles at the 
cheapest price, but if its systems break down at a critical trading moment 
and you’re not able to implement your trades when you want to, those bells 
and whistles mean nothing, and not being able to rely on them can result in 
huge losses. Look for brokers that allow you to test drive a demo version of 
order entry systems.
Doing a little research
If you expect to become an active and successful trader and want full access 
so you can trade electronically through the exchanges, you more than likely 
need to research direct-access brokers. If, however, you believe that your 
volume of trades per month will be lower than 50, you may want to consider 
a discount broker that offers access to ECNs. Basically, your choice of brokers 
comes down to the types of services and accounts you need and which 
broker offers the best mix for what you want to do and pay.

44
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
 
Your first step is to make lists of your financial objectives, the types of 
trading you want to do, and the services you know you’re going to need. After 
committing those factors to memory, talk with other traders you know and be 
sure to find out what their experiences have been with various brokers.
You can also research and compare ratings of brokers on the Internet. Try 
these Web sites:
 
✓ SmartMoney: This site also conducts a yearly survey that can give you 
an excellent overview of broker performance. Go to www.smartmoney.
com, click on “Stocks & Options” in the left-hand menu, and then scroll 
down to “Annual Broker Survey.” The survey lists rankings for basic and 
premium discount brokers and full-service brokers.
 
✓ Barron’s: The Web site of the weekly financial magazine (www.barrons.
com) does an excellent annual evaluation of online brokers and 
direct-access brokers, usually in March. A subscription is required.
 
✓ Active Trader magazine (www.activetradermag.com) and Stocks 
and Commodities magazine (www.traders.com) also periodically 
review brokers and trading platforms. Subscriptions are required.
After narrowing down your choices, check out the disciplinary histories of 
the brokerage firms you’re considering. You can easily do that by calling 
a toll-free hotline operated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority 
(FINRA) at 800-289-9999, or checking its Web site at www.finra.org to 
find out what disciplinary actions (if any) have been taken by securities 
regulators or criminal authorities. You also need to call your state regulator 
to be sure the specific broker you’re thinking about working with is licensed 
to do business in your state. This information can be crucial. If you work with 
an unlicensed broker who goes out of business, you may not have any way of 
recovering any lost funds even if an arbitrator or court rules in your favor.
Understanding how you’ll be paying
After conducting your initial research into brokerage firms and narrowing 
down your choices, be sure you understand how the brokerage firms are 
paid by
 
✓ Reviewing each firm’s fee and commission schedule. The schedules 
should include the fees or charges you’re required to pay when opening 
the account and what you pay to maintain and close the account.
 
✓ Finding out how your broker is compensated if you’re planning to work 
with a human being rather than trade online. Many brokers receive 
higher compensation when they sell their firm’s own products, so they 
may try to steer you toward them rather than another product that 
may be a better match for your trading objectives. Rarely are brokerage 
products good trading vehicles.

45
 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Brokerage Options
One other level of protection that you need to check on is the broker’s 
membership in the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). 
Although SIPC membership won’t insure you against losses caused by market 
declines, the SIPC does give you some protection if your brokerage firm faces 
insolvency. You can find out more about the SIPC at www.sipc.org.
Getting to Know the Rules
After you pick your broker, you must be sure you know the trading rules. 
Although federal law mandates margin requirements, sets trade settlement 
rules, and bans free riding (nope, we’re not talking about horseback riding 
here), brokerage firms sometimes have even more stringent rules for their 
clients. We review the federal requirements here, but you need to check with 
your broker to find out any additional rules your chosen firm imposes.
Rules for stock trading fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve, 
which specifies its stock trading regulations in Regulation T. Rules spelled 
out under Regulation T encompass margin accounts, broker-dealer accounts, 
securities transactions, credit extended based on securities, and other factors 
related to securities markets. We don’t review all the specifics here, but 
instead we home in on three key areas that impact your trading choices — 
margin requirements, trade settlement, and free riding.
Margin requirements
The Federal Reserve’s Regulation T specifies how much you can borrow 
when you use a margin account to purchase new shares of stocks on margin. 
This initial margin requirement permits you to borrow up to 50 percent of the 
cost of the new shares. For example, if you open a new margin account with 
a $10,000 cash deposit, you can buy up to $20,000 worth of stock. After your 
$20,000 purchase, your account will have a cash balance of $0, an equity 
balance of $10,000, and a margin balance of $10,000. At this time, all your 
equity is committed to this trade, so you cannot enter any new positions 
unless you deposit additional funds.
If the stock price increases, your equity balance increases. If the stock 
price decreases, your equity balance decreases. In either case, your margin 
balance remains the same, $10,000. The only way to reduce the outstanding 
margin balance is to deposit extra cash into your account or sell the shares 
of stock.
When your stock price increases, your equity balance increases and you may 
use the increased equity as collateral to borrow additional money to buy 
additional shares of stocks. You may borrow up to the value of the increased 
equity balance. This will increase your margin balance.

46
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
However, if your equity balance decreases, FINRA rules (Rule 431 and Rule 
2520, respectively) regulate the minimum equity position permitted in 
your account. Currently, the minimum is 25 percent of the total value of all 
margined securities. Some brokers may require more.
In the single-stock example earlier in this chapter, if the total value of the 
stock falls below $13,332, then the equity balance in your portfolio will be 
less than 25 percent of the total value. The math is simple: 25 percent of 
$13,332 is $3,333. Your cash balance is still $0 and your margin balance is 
still $10,000. Subtract $10,000 from $13,332 to determine your equity balance, 
which is $3,332. Your equity balance is less than 25 percent of your total 
account balance.
When this occurs, your broker will call and demand additional collateral to 
support the outstanding margin loan. This is a margin call. You may meet 
your margin call requirements by depositing more cash or you may deposit 
fully paid, unmargined securities from another account. If you do not deposit 
additional collateral, your broker is permitted to sell up to four times the 
amount of stock required to meet your margin call, and may sell any of the 
stocks in your portfolio.
If you have more than a few positions, margin calculations become complex. 
It helps to think about it like this: When initiating a new position, you can 
never borrow more than half of the value of the position. To maintain 
sufficient collateral, your broker will insist that the value of your stocks be 
more than enough to cover the loan. Therefore, if your equity balance falls 
below 25 percent of the total portfolio value, your broker will ask for 
additional collateral in the form of a margin call.
As a trader, you should never satisfy a margin call. Instead, you should close 
the offending position(s). It is possible that an extraordinary event may cause 
the value of your stocks to fall below the amount owned on your outstanding 
margin loan. If this happens, your broker will close your positions, but you 
must still repay the debt. Unlike a cash account, you can lose more than 100 
percent of the money you deposit into a margin account.
 
Note: Not all stocks can be bought on margin and neither can all stocks be 
used as collateral. If you want to trade on margin, be sure you understand the 
margin requirements imposed by your broker. Some brokerage firms require 
even stiffer requirements to maintain a margin account, especially if you trade 
volatile or lightly-traded stocks.
 
FINRA Rule 2520 was amended in 2001 to restrict day-trading activity. Your 
broker or the FINRA will consider you a pattern day trader after you buy or sell 
any security on the same day in a margin account and execute four or more 
such trades during a five-day business period (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, 
and holidays). If you’re pegged as a pattern day trader, you’re required to 
maintain $25,000 in your margin account, which can seriously impact your day 
trading and other trading activities.

47
 Chapter 3: Going for Broke(r): Discovering Your Brokerage Options
Settling trades
When you place an order to buy a stock, you must settle that transaction in 
three business days. This settlement cycle is known as T + 3. The brokerage 
firm must receive your payment for any securities you buy no later than 
three days after the trade is executed. If you’re selling a stock, it’s probably 
being held in your brokerage account and will be taken out of that account 
on the day of settlement. Options and government securities trade on a T + 1 
settlement cycle, which means these transactions settle the next trading day.
Free riding
No, we’re not talking about hopping a train on the sly. Free riding in the 
stock-trading world can get you in a bunch of trouble, so keep reading. 
Basically it means that you must pay for a stock before you can sell it, and 
because it takes three days to settle a stock transaction, that means, in 
theory, you can actually buy a stock and then place an order to sell it before 
the stock purchase actually settles.
This is a cash account problem. Although many swing and day traders 
actually turn around stock purchases and sales that quickly, they typically 
trade in a margin account and are able to sidestep the problem. Margin 
traders use the unsettled proceeds of a trade as collateral to borrow money 
until the trade is settled. Still, day traders and swing traders must have enough 
cash or buying power in their accounts to cover all purchases of stock.
 
Formally, this rule is found in Section 220 of Regulation T, which states that in 
a cash account, a brokerage firm may buy a security on your behalf — or sell a 
security — if either of the following applies:
 
✓ You have sufficient funds in the account.
 
✓ The firm accepts in good faith your agreement to make a full-cash 
payment for the security before you sell it.
If you do ever buy and sell a security before the settlement cycle (T + 3) is 
complete — or even on the same day — and without sufficient cash in your 
account, a brokerage firm can make what is called an intraday extension of 
credit (a loan), but that exposes the firm to increased risks — especially the 
risk that you may overextend your financial resources and may not be able to 
settle your trades. Most brokerage firms require active traders who buy and 
then sell securities within the settlement cycle to conduct those activities 
within a margin account.
If you take a free ride and haven’t made some type of credit arrangement with 
your broker, your broker is likely to freeze your account for 90 days. During 
that 90-day period, the broker requires you to pay for any purchase on the 

48
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
date that you make the trade. In other words, you lose the option of settling 
your trades within three days. Some brokerage firms require you to have 
enough cash in your account to complete the transaction before you make 
the trade so you thus avoid even the risk of free riding.
We talk more about these rapid forms of trading (swing trading and day 
trading) in Chapters 16 and 17.

ack in the old days, you’d call your broker to enter an order and then 
wait for your broker to phone back and report the fill price. Active 
traders? They’d hang out in the broker’s lobby, watching the ticker, boasting 
over winning trades, commiserating over losing trades, and shooting the 
breeze.
If you kept charts, you either made them yourself or had them delivered 
by postal carrier in book form. They arrived at the end of each week. If you 
couldn’t afford that extravagance, you’d buy monthly summaries and update 
them yourself.
Every retail investor bought and sold stocks the same way. The pros had the 
advantage, but it was more or less a level playing field for the rest of us.
Today, you’d be hard-pressed to find a ticker-tape machine in any brokerage 
office. The Internet has changed everything. You can still buy chart books, 
but now they’re delivered via the Internet, and so are stock prices, real-
time intraday charts, and research reports. You can enter orders online, 
have your orders filled within seconds, and receive notification showing the 
order’s price almost as quickly.
Online brokers provide a vast array of research and trading tools for their 
clients. Real-time streaming quotes, proprietary and third-party research, 
sophisticated charts, and extensive order-entry capabilities make today’s 
traders better informed and better equipped than ever before.

Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
If you’re anything like us, you’re going to spend plenty of time with your 
trading platform. It pays to spend a little time thinking about what information 
you need now, how you’ll use it, and what you may need in the future. With 
just a little foresight, you can set up your trading platform so that it’s 
effective today and yet still be able to upgrade it without completely 
disrupting your day-to-day activities.
In this chapter, we review the basic computer hardware you need to access 
all there is to offer for traders, explore the software options you’ll want to 
consider for managing your trading activities, and discuss various trading 
platforms and data-feed alternatives. Finally, we give you a road map to the 
options available on the Internet.
Making Use of Your Computer
Although tracking the market and charting stock prices by hand is an 
excellent learning exercise — it gives you a feel for the market that you can’t 
get by reviewing computer-generated charts — we doubt that you’d want to 
travel to the local library or your broker’s office to research the stocks that 
interest you. The wealth of online information that can help you improve 
your trading results is simply remarkable. This section lists some of the 
things you can do with your computer.
Identifying trading candidates
With your computer, you can do all of the following:
 
✓ Display and interpret price charts
 
✓ Research stocks, bonds, IPOs, options, and futures
 
✓ Read analyst reports and company reports to the SEC
 
✓ Screen stocks for technical or fundamental constraints
 
✓ Monitor economic reports, earnings reports, and business news
 
✓ Monitor market indexes, sectors, and trading statistics

51
 Chapter 4: Putting Your Computer to Work: Your Key Business Tool
Managing your account
Managing your account can involve some or all of the following:
 
✓ Entering and executing trades, and monitoring open orders
 
✓ Controlling and tracking order routing
 
✓ Receiving almost instantaneous fill reports
 
✓ Monitoring and analyzing your portfolio and all open positions
 
✓ Tracking profits and losses
 
✓ Analyzing your trading history
Improving your trades
You can become a better trader by doing the following:
 
✓ Evaluating trading systems and testing trading ideas
 
✓ Keeping trading logs to audit your trading performance
 
✓ Monitoring the tax consequences of your trades
 
✓ Staying in touch with other traders
Finding Price Charts
Price charts show the history of a stock’s price over time. These charts 
conceal useful trading information that is revealed with careful analysis. 
Reading, interpreting, and understanding what you see in a price chart are 
described in Chapters 8 through 11.
 
Fortunately, price charts are easy to find. If your broker doesn’t provide an 
adequate charting package, you can find excellent charting tools on dozens of 
online sites. If you have to go outside your broker’s environment, you may 
have to put up with Internet banner ads. Most of the charts on free Web sites 
display 20-minute delayed prices. You may have to pay $9.95 to $34.95 a 
month for Internet charts that update in real time.

52
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
At a minimum, you need control over the time frame and the types of charts 
displayed. For example, you probably want 1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute, 
and 60-minute charts to go with daily, weekly, and monthly charts. Other 
features to look for include these:
 
✓ Trading volume. (It’s critical.)
 
✓ Moving averages to show average prices over time. You’ll want at least 
two types, simple moving averages and exponential moving averages, 
and you’ll want control over the period being averaged. Moving averages 
are discussed in Chapter 11.
 
✓ Indicators and oscillators to help evaluate a stock’s direction and 
momentum. We use the MACD (Moving Average Convergence 
Divergence) indicator and the Stochastics Oscillator. Indicators and 
oscillators are discussed in Chapter 11.
 
✓ A variety of chart styles, including bar charts and candlestick charts. 
Bar charts are the most popular stock charts, and they’re the ones we 
use throughout this book. We describe how to read and interpret them 
in Chapter 9. Candlestick charts display the price data using a slightly 
different format that is preferred by some traders. The analysis techniques 
in this book work for both styles.
 
✓ Ability to display data in a log or semi-log format. This allows equal 
percentage price changes to appear the same on the price chart, which 
is helpful for comparing the price movements of two differently priced 
stocks. For example, if a $10 stock rises to $20, that’s a 100 percent 
price change. If a $50 stock rises to $100, that’s also a 100 percent price 
increase, but it will look like a much larger price increase on a standard 
price chart. Use a log or semi-log format to show similar percentage 
changes so they look the same on the chart.
 
✓ Ability to group charts together so you can quickly scan open positions 
or trade candidates.
 
✓ Ability to show support and resistance levels, draw trend lines, and 
make annotations.
There are two kinds of online charts: real-time charts and delayed-price 
charts. While the charts may be identical, the prices shown in the charts 
are not. Real-time charts display current price data updated within a few 
seconds of the trade. Delayed-price charts do not show the most current 
trades. Instead, the prices shown on the chart are at least 15 to 20 minutes old.

53
 Chapter 4: Putting Your Computer to Work: Your Key Business Tool
Although many excellent online charting alternatives are out there, they 
typically aren’t as flexible or configurable as the ones offered in stand-alone 
charting packages or integrated trading platforms. And you probably won’t 
have access to trading-system development and testing software that is 
required to create and test your own trading system. The advantages and 
disadvantages of online charts, stand-alone charting packages, and integrated 
trading platforms are discussed in the following sections. We discuss methods 
for developing and testing personalized trading systems in Chapter 15.
Internet charts, delayed prices
 
Although real-time charts are desirable, they’re a necessity only for extremely 
active short-term traders. Analyzing the market and developing your trading 
plan are best done before the market in which you plan to make your trades 
opens, or after it closes. Delayed-price charts are more than adequate for 
these planning and analysis activities.
You can use delayed-price charts to identify support and resistance levels, 
display moving averages, find emerging trends, and select possible entry and 
exit points for tomorrow’s trading day.
Here are a few sources for online charts:
 
✓ BigCharts (www.bigcharts.com): BigCharts is part of the CBS 
MarketWatch family. The site is free and offers an excellent charting 
package with plenty of options, including interactive charts, industry 
analysis, and stock screeners. You can define a list of favorite charts for 
quick review. News and market commentary are also provided.
 
✓ Investor’s Business Daily (www.investors.com): Investor’s Business 
Daily (IBD) publishes its proprietary ranking system online and in its 
daily paper. Using the stock-picking methodology developed by publisher 
William O’Neil, the site provides charts and rankings by relative strength 
and earnings growth. Available by subscription.
 
✓ Decision Point (www.decisionpoint.com): Decision Point is another 
subscription charting site, but it takes a different approach, providing 
chart books, hundreds of unique charts, and market commentary based 
primarily on technical analysis. If you’re looking for a quick way to scan 
a large group of stocks, this site provides excellent tools. You may find 
that Decision Point is a nice complement to a more traditional charting 
site or charting software package.

54
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Internet charts, real-time prices
Although most online brokers provide support for real-time prices, not all 
provide real-time charting capabilities. If your broker doesn’t offer what 
you need, and you find delayed prices are just too frustrating, you can find 
a number of sites that offer real-time price charts. Real-time, browser-based 
Internet charts usually aren’t free. You will generally find them priced 
between $9.95 and $34.95 per month.
 
Sites offering real-time charts include the following:
 
✓ StockCharts (www.stockcharts.com): Chip Anderson started 
StockCharts early in Internet history. He’s one of the few independents 
still around, and for good reason — the site is excellent. We use charts 
from this Web site throughout the book. StockCharts offers many 
excellent free charting tools, but the best parts are available by 
subscription. Advanced features include real-time, intraday pricing, the 
ability to create and store chart annotations, the ability to create large 
lists of your favorite charts, the ability to define custom chart settings, 
and the capability of creating custom scans based on technical indicators. 
Make sure that you click on “SharpCharts Voyeur,” which is listed under 
“Tools & Charts” on the StockCharts home page. It shows charts that are 
of interest to other traders.
 
✓ FreeRealTime.com (www.freerealtime.com): The free capabilities of 
the site are fairly limited, and you’ll have to put up with banner ads and 
the occasional full-page ad that display before the page you actually 
want appears. The free portion of this site uses data from electronic 
communications networks (ECNs), not data from the major stock 
exchanges. Unfortunately, ECNs do not trade all stocks, so real-time 
charts and quotes may not always be available. And ECN prices may not 
always match prices on the major exchanges, but they’ll be very close. If 
you can put up with these limitations, the charts and price quotes are in 
real time. And they’re free.
Charting software
 
Before taking a step up toward a stand-alone charting application, make sure 
that you explore the tools provided by your broker and other brokers and by 
Web sites offering Internet charts. Some of these online tools are powerful and 
may be more cost effective than a stand-alone package.
Stand-alone charting software, however, often provides capabilities beyond 
what you can find online. For example, charting software packages offer 
system testing but rarely are they part of a Web site’s tool set.

55
 Chapter 4: Putting Your Computer to Work: Your Key Business Tool
Several packages are available; two examples include
 
✓ MetaStock (www.equis.com): MetaStock comes in two flavors, a standard 
end-of-day trading package, and a professional version for intraday 
charts. Each offers a variety of analysis tools, technical indicators, 
system development and testing capabilities, and access to fundamental 
stock data.
 
✓ TradeStation (www.tradestation.com): TradeStation is the gold 
standard of charting software. It is powerful, flexible, and configurable, 
and it’s designed to work the same way institutional trading platforms 
do. You can fully automate your trading system by programming your 
strategies into the system and then having TradeStation execute them in 
real time. (Whether you should do so, however, is open for discussion.) 
It also supports direct access to all ECNs and stock exchanges.
Many other charting packages are available, but these two packages are 
widely used and give you a good basis for comparing all the other available 
products.
 
The drawback to stand-alone charting software is the expense. In addition to 
the price of the software, you need a data provider to deliver end-of-day or 
intraday market prices. When selecting a charting software package, make 
sure that it supports the data service you plan to use. They must work 
together.
Data service vendors include
 
✓ Reuters DataLink (www.equis.com)
 
✓ QuoteCenter (www.quotecenter.ca)
 
✓ eSignal (www.esignal.com)
Finding Fundamental Information
Fundamental data — corporate information such as revenue, earnings, and 
cash flow — isn’t as perishable as price data or trading statistics, but 
accessing these numbers directly from your trading platform as they’re 
updated is a nice feature. Analysis of fundamental data is discussed in 
Chapters 5, 6, and 7. Many brokers provide access to at least some 
fundamental data, but if you’d like to run the numbers yourself, many of 
these online sources can review the raw financial data:

56
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
 
✓ The Wall Street Journal (www.wsj.com): The Wall Street Journal is 
available online by subscription. It provides access to a wide variety 
of information including stock quotes, stock valuation indexes, 
fundamental ratios, industry comparisons, insider transactions, 
earnings estimates, and stock analysis reports. Delayed-price charts 
also are available. The price for subscribers to the print version of The 
Wall Street Journal or Barron’s is $39 annually, otherwise it’s $119. They 
offer a free two-week trial.
 
✓ Edgar (www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml): All publicly traded companies 
are required to file 10-Q and 10-K quarterly and annual reports 
electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
through its Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval system 
(EDGAR). These reports are available to everyone online at no charge.
Finding Analyst Reports
Sometimes you can find these research reports at your local library, especially 
for big outfits like Standard & Poor’s and Value Line. Many analysts sell 
research in the form of investment newsletter subscriptions. We’ve used 
several of the following subscription services through the years, with varying 
degrees of success:
 
✓ Standard & Poor’s (www.standardandpoors.com): Registration is 
required, but access is free. You cannot access the full reports and 
recommendations on this site, but the Business Week magazine Web site 
(www.businessweek.com/investor) offers several complete S&P 
reports, stock screens, and industry reports at no charge.
 
✓ Value Line (www.valueline.com): The Value Line Investment 
Survey has been around for a long time. It profiles many of the major 
corporations and provides a variety of stock screens based on proprietary 
models. It also offers opinions on current economic and market climates. 
Some reports and updates are available on the site at no charge, but a 
subscription is required to access the complete site.
 
✓ Briefing.com (www.briefing.com): This site has free and subscription 
components. Advanced features include access to analysts’ upgrades 
and downgrades as they’re released, access to updated earnings 
guidance, an IPO calendar, notification of changes in stock indexes, and 
quite a bit more.
 
✓ Morningstar (www.morningstar.com): Morningstar probably is best 
known for its analysis of mutual funds, but it also provides extensive 
stock analysis, editorial commentary, a stock-screening tool, and a 
thorough snapshot tool that shows financial performance, fund 
ownership, and recent fund transactions. A subscription is required to 
access premium content.

 Chapter 4: Putting Your Computer to Work: Your Key Business Tool
Selecting a Trading Platform
You’ll find as many different approaches to trading as you’ll find traders. 
Fortunately, almost as many alternatives for setting up your trading 
environment also exist.
As technology develops and expands, online brokers are providing 
increasingly powerful trading tools for their clients. These tools include 
market research, charting capabilities, streaming prices and news services. 
If your broker doesn’t offer a specific service, you probably can find it offered 
on the Internet.
When selecting a trading platform, look for the capabilities you need today 
with an eye toward future expandability. You may want to consider the 
features in the three lists that follow.
Trading tools to look for include the following:
 
✓ Stock trading
 
✓ Support of sophisticated option trading strategies
 
✓ Futures trading, especially single-stock and index futures
 
✓ NASDAQ Level II access
 
✓ Direct-access trading and ECN book data
 
✓ Watch lists
 
✓ Automatic e-mail or text message notification when a stock hits your 
price point
Analysis tools to shop for include these:
 
✓ Sector analysis
 
✓ Proprietary and third-party analyst’s reports
 
✓ News feeds (Dow Jones, Reuters, and so on)
 
✓ Real-time charting capabilities
 
✓ Time and volume sales reports
Account management tools that you may need include the following:
 
✓ Real-time account balances
 
✓ Real-time updates of buying power and margin exposure
 
✓ Portfolio management tools
 
✓ Open-order status

Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
 
Before putting your computer to work as a trading platform, you need to 
understand the two primary techniques for delivering trading tools and 
services. The first uses your Internet browser to enter orders and deliver all 
information. The other approach uses a stand-alone software program, an 
integrated trading platform, to interact with your broker and your brokerage 
account.
For the most part, integrated trading platforms are married to specific 
brokerage firms. Some brokers provide you with a choice. For example, 
Charles Schwab’s CyberTrader offers the integrated software-based system, 
StreetSmart Pro and StreetSmart.com for Web-based trading tools.
 
The approach that suits you best depends somewhat on your trading style, 
cost considerations, and your computer’s configuration. You may find that 
the level of service offered by your broker depends on the size of your 
account or your trading volume. You have to balance your cost with your 
actual information needs.
Integrated trading platforms typically are direct-access systems. We discuss 
both direct-access brokers and traditional online brokers in Chapter 3. 
Although direct-access systems are offered in browser-based configurations, 
active day traders and swing traders may require a completely integrated, 
direct-access trading platform.
Browser-based trading environment
 
For most new traders, trading volume starts out relatively small, perhaps five 
or fewer trades each month. Your time frame for holding a position probably 
is measured in days to weeks or weeks to months. You probably won’t be 
making many intraday trades, except to automatically exit a position after a 
stop price is hit. In that case, a browser-based trading environment certainly 
is good enough to get you started and may be all you’ll ever need.
These systems may be tightly integrated or somewhat disjointed, 
depending on the way the broker implements them. Some brokers, for 
example, automatically fill in order-entry screens with as much data as can 
be gleaned from your account. Others make you type all the data into the 
order screen by hand, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Some 
brokers provide pop-up order confirmation and fill reports, and others make 
you continuously press the Enter key while waiting for a trade execution to 
show in your account.

59
 Chapter 4: Putting Your Computer to Work: Your Key Business Tool
Pros
For the most part, almost any Internet-ready computer can support a 
browser-based trading platform. Although Windows is most often used for 
trading platforms, even Apple Macintosh or Linux systems can be used for 
most browser-based applications.
Much of the browser-based information offered by your broker is available 
to all clients, regardless of account size or trading volume. If your broker 
doesn’t offer something you want, you usually can find it elsewhere on the 
Internet, either free or for a modest fee.
Cons
When compared to an integrated software solution, browser-based trading is 
relatively slow, requiring you to open many browser windows and manually 
update account information. Depending on how well your broker implements 
these systems, a bit more typing may be necessary to enter and execute your 
orders.
 
On some browser-based trading platforms, your Internet session may be 
disconnected whenever your screen is inactive for an extended period of 
time. At best, this kind of interruption can be frustrating. Similarly, some 
configurations depend on your using a specific browser, or may require that 
you download and install a special browser plug-in to operate correctly.
Integrated trading platforms
For very active traders, especially day traders and swing traders, and for 
traders looking to develop personalized trading systems, an integrated 
trading platform that doesn’t rely on your Internet browser can be a better 
solution. You typically download these software programs, install them on 
your computer, and then use them to access your brokerage account and 
trading tools. They range from rudimentary text-based applications with 
modest graphing capabilities to sophisticated technical-analysis programs 
that enable you to design and implement custom trading systems.
The most sophisticated of these platforms provides an institutional-level 
trading experience. Some, for example, permit trading baskets that enable 
you to simultaneously enter orders for a number of different stocks. Others 
help you to define hot keys for fast order entry.

60
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
You’ll also find that integrated trading platforms provide support for 
sophisticated strategies. The most flexible among them give you the ability 
to enter contingent orders, where, for example, a stock’s price may trigger 
an option order or the execution of one order automatically cancels another. 
Several brokers will notify you by e-mail or a cellphone text message when a 
stock hits a price you’ve specified or an indicator reaches a preset level. One 
broker even gives you the ability to automatically execute trades based on 
recommendations from well-known and reputable advisory services.
Pros
These trading platforms typically are faster and easier to use and customize 
than browser-based applications. The best among them have system-testing 
tools that help you fine-tune your personal trading strategies.
Cons
Integrated trading platforms can be expensive. Unless you have a large 
account balance, your broker may charge you either a monthly fee or base 
the access on your making a minimum number of monthly trades.
Furthermore, these platforms often require up-to-date computer equipment 
with a fast processor and plenty of storage to run well. Older equipment 
will not run this software satisfactorily. And it’s likely you’ll need to use the 
Windows operating system.

depend on having access to NASDAQ Level 
II data or direct electronic communications 
network (ECN) access.
However, I prefer working with a charting 
package versus evaluating charts by using a 
browser. I’ve used several popular packages, 
and a couple of homegrown applications. (Yes, 
I’ll admit that I’m sort of a geek.)
My solution was to implement a hybrid 
approach that uses browser-based tools for 
account management and order entry along-
side a software-based charting application. 
This approach provides me with access to more 
market data than I ever had when I worked as 
a broker, gives me tremendous flexibility, and 
minimizes my trading costs.
And it suits my trading style. For some reason, 
the world looks different when I’m sitting in 
front of a computer. I feel rushed, somehow, 
and I don’t make my best decisions. That’s one 
of the reasons I don’t day trade. The pace works 
against me; I get caught up in the moment and 
end up making mistakes.
I think and plan better when I’m sitting by myself, 
in a quiet corner of my home, with a pen in my 
hand. I’ll print the reports and charts that inter-
est me, sit in a comfy chair, mark up my reports, 
and deliberately chart my trading course.
Only then am I ready to enter orders online.

 Chapter 4: Putting Your Computer to Work: Your Key Business Tool
Determining Computer Requirements
Few new traders actually need a fully integrated direct-access trading 
platform to begin trading or to trade profitably. But if you’re considering a 
new computer system, the hardware and software requirements for these 
high-powered platforms may be of benefit. Otherwise, you may be unable to 
upgrade your new computer to run these applications.
Decisions, decisions . . .
Most trading platforms are designed for Windows, but die-hard Mac and 
Linux fans aren’t completely locked out. If you’re starting with a browser-based 
approach, almost any modern, Internet-ready computer can handle the task. 
Browser-based Internet tools usually work equally well on any hardware or 
operating system. Sadly, some sites require functions provided by a specific 
browser, but that is becoming increasingly rare.
 
If you’re planning to buy new computer hardware for trading, we recommend 
that you avoid Mac hardware or Unix/Linux operating systems. Although Mac 
and Linux support browser-based applications at least as well as Windows, 
you may be unable to upgrade if ever you want a more integrated trading 
platform. We don’t know of any commercially available trading platforms for 
independent traders (as opposed to institutional traders) that run on Linux 
or either Mac OS 9 or OS X.
Configuring your computer system
 
Regardless of whether you decide to employ a browser-based approach or 
an integrated trading platform, you’re going to need a reliable computer with 
sufficient horsepower, memory, and storage space.
Some of today’s high-powered, integrated trading software requires equally 
high-powered computer systems. We give you general hardware guidelines in 
this section, but if you decide you want a computer that can be upgraded to 
handle a high-performance integrated trading platform, you also need to check 
with specific software vendors to identify any special hardware requirements. 
You also need to be certain that your hardware supports your software.
 
Software vendors often claim that their products can run on relatively modest 
hardware configurations; however, you’ll probably be disappointed and 
frustrated with system performance under such conditions. These software 
packages run much better on a computer that surpasses the system require-
ments. Trading platforms — especially testing applications and multichart, 
multiwindow, multimonitor displays — consume considerable amounts of 
system resources and can make many computers run unbearably slow.

62
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
The following minimum configurations easily support browser-based 
solutions. Upgraded configurations, however, may be required to adequately 
support fully integrated trading environments.
 
✓ Central processing unit (CPU): At a minimum, you need a 1 GHz 
processor. Ideally, something much faster works better. Trading 
applications tend to rely on making many mathematical calculations, 
so you want to avoid the value-priced CPU chip sets. Look instead for 
systems that are primarily designed for graphics or gaming applications. 
Ideally, you should select a DualCore processor.
 
 The slowest machines being sold today are rated in gigahertz multiples, 
and most modern machines have enough CPU horsepower to run 
charting application programs. However, high-end programs like 
TradeStation take advantage of specialty hardware such as multi-CPU 
and hyperthreading configurations. Check with software manufacturers 
for specific details.
 
✓ RAM memory: 1GB of RAM is the absolute minimum, but you probably 
want more. Memory is inexpensive compared with other hardware 
upgrades, and having too much of it is next to impossible. Error-
correcting memory may buy only extra peace of mind, but it doesn’t 
cost much more than standard memory.
 
✓ Available disk space: 1GB of free disk space should be enough when 
starting out, but you’ll need much more for long-term storage of real-time 
price data, which will be useful for developing and testing your own 
trading system. Chapter 15 discusses methods to personalize a trading 
system.
 
✓ Operating system: If you’re running a Windows environment, you need 
to be running at least Windows XP or Vista. Although browsers and 
software applications will run on older versions of Windows, XP and 
Vista give you more stability and reliability than earlier versions of 
Windows. For trading applications, you want the most reliable system 
you can find and afford. Windows XP and Vista may not be bulletproof, 
but they’re so much better than their predecessors that you definitely 
want to upgrade if you haven’t already.
 
✓ Video card: Although you may be able to squeak by using a shared-
memory video system (it shares some of your RAM), you’ll be better off 
with a stand-alone video card that relies on its own video memory. A 
minimum configuration for a single monitor requires at least 128MB of 
video memory, but 256MB of video RAM is better. You may even want 
1GB whenever you opt for a single video card that supports dual monitors.

63
 Chapter 4: Putting Your Computer to Work: Your Key Business Tool
 
✓ Monitor size: Modern high-resolution LCD monitors are excellent and 
inexpensive. A 17-inch monitor probably is the smallest you should 
consider. Bigger is better. Even more important than size is the monitor’s 
resolution. Anything less than 1024 x 768 resolution is useless for 
reading chart detail, but you will want more. If you’re going with a single 
monitor setup, you should consider a 20- or 22-inch monitor with 
resolution up to 1920 x 1200.
 
✓ Dual monitor configurations: Some traders swear by the dual monitor 
configuration. The idea is to pull up your charts on one monitor and 
everything else on the other. Many video cards support dual monitors.
 
✓ Network interface: You need some way of accessing a high-speed 
Internet connection (see the next section). Many computers now come 
with either a built-in Ethernet port or an extra Ethernet Interface Card. 
Either works fine.
 
✓ Power supply: We recommend that you use an uninterruptible power 
supply (UPS). A UPS is relatively inexpensive and provides an extra 
measure of security. Some protect against lightning strikes. If you live in 
an area where power fluctuations are common, a UPS is a must.
Accessing the Internet
You must have reliable Internet access, and that means a high-speed 
connection — either DSL or cable Internet will work fine. Some very active 
day traders will spring for a fractional T1 or dedicated T1 line for an 
additional measure of reliability, but either approach is expensive. A backup 
connection is a good idea. Consider a wireless laptop card or even a second 
high-speed Internet connection.
A dial-up connection is not fast enough or reliable enough for trading. If 
dial-up is your only alternative, you may be able to temporarily squeak by 
with it, but look for an alternative as soon as possible.
Connecting to the Internet
Depending on where you live, you may have several good high-speed 
alternatives for reliably connecting to the Internet. Cable and DSL connections 
usually work well.

64
Part I: So You Want to Be a Trader: Gathering Your Tools 
Because of security concerns, avoid wireless networks unless you’re 
absolutely certain that you know how to configure the network to keep 
prying eyes from seeing your private trading and account information.
Picking a browser
Any modern browser probably will do. Although stumbling across a site that 
uses some browser-specific functions is a possibility, that scenario is becoming 
increasingly rare. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer is bundled with the Windows 
operating system at no additional charge. It will serve your needs well enough. 
Mozilla Firefox (www.mozilla.org) is another excellent — and free — choice.
Securing your computer
 
The Internet is a dangerous place. You must protect your computer system 
and its data against attacks by vandals, hackers, and thieves. Make sure that 
you have modern virus-scanning software, and keep your virus definitions up 
to date.
Norton’s AntiVirus program gets good reviews and seems to do the job just 
fine. It can automatically update its virus definitions. You can get more infor-
mation about Norton’s program at www.symantec.com. McAfee Security’s 
VirusScan also gets high marks from those in the know. Additional informa-
tion is available on the Web at www.mcafee.com.
We also recommend that you use a firewall. The Windows Vista firewall is 
sufficient. Third-party firewalls like the free Zone Alarm firewall from Check 
Point Software Technologies (www.zonealarm.com) also work well. Zone 
Alarm monitors your connection to the Internet and is able to detect trojans 
and worms that are trying to call home. This is an increasingly critical 
requirement. In addition, you should consider installing a hardware firewall to 
provide an additional layer of security. Most routers include a hardware firewall, 
and allow you to share your Internet connection with multiple computers.
Finally, keeping up to date with your operating system’s security patches, 
especially when you’re running Windows, is important. More viruses are 
written for Windows than for any other operating system.
You can configure Windows to automatically check for system updates. To 
do so, go to Security in the Vista Control Panel, or System Properties, under 
Performance and Maintenance, in the Windows XP Control Panel. Select 
the Automatic Updates tab and check the appropriate settings to keep your 
Windows system up to date. You can also go to the Windows Update site 
(windowsupdate.microsoft.com) to make sure all your system patches 
have been applied.

Y
ou hear plenty about recession and inflation. You know both can 
mean bad economic news, but do you really understand what they 
mean and why they happen? Regardless of what the economic gurus do, 
the economy cycles between periods of economic growth and recession. If 
growth becomes overheated, periods of inflation are likely. Inflation can also 
be caused when the value of the currency falls. For example, when the value 
of the U.S. dollar falls, that causes an increase in the price of imports and 
commodities like oil for U.S. residents. That, in turn, impacts the price of just 
about every other good sold in the United States.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Fed) oversees moves that 
are made in monetary policy in the United States, and the legislative and 
executive branches of government are responsible for tax changes and other 
fiscal policy moves. The actions of the Fed and the government can minimize 
the impact of inflation or recession and spur economic growth, but nothing 
can be done to erase economic cycles. Markets and traders try to anticipate 
these cyclical moves with an eye toward recording gains. This chapter will 
help you understand which economic indicators tend to lead these cycles 
and how you can use them to understand the current state of the markets 
and the economy.

Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
The Basics of the Business Cycle
The old adage, “What goes up must come down,” is as true for the economy 
as it is for any physical object. When a business cycle reaches its peak, 
nothing is wrong in the economic world; businesses and investors are making 
plenty of money and everyone is happy. Unfortunately, the economy can’t 
exist at its peak forever. In the same way that gravity eventually makes a 
rising object fall, a revved up economy eventually reaches its high and begins 
to tumble.
The peak is only one of the four distinct parts of every business cycle — 
peak, recession, trough, and expansion/recovery (see Figure 5-1). Although 
none of these parts is designated as the beginning of a business cycle, here 
are the portions of the business cycle that each represents:
 
✓ Peak: During a peak, the economy is humming along at full speed, 
with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP — more about that later in the 
chapter) near its maximum output and employment levels near their 
all-time highs. Income and prices are increasing, and the risk of inflation 
is great, if it hasn’t already set in. Businesses and investors are 
prospering and very happy.
 
✓ Recession: As the old adage goes, “All good things must come to an 
end.” As the economy falls from its peak, employment levels begin to 
decline, production and output eventually decline, and wages and prices 
level off, but more than likely won’t actually fall unless the recession is a 
long one.
 
✓ Trough: When a recession bottoms out, the economy levels out into a 
period called the trough. If this period is a prolonged one, it can become 
a depression, which is a severe and prolonged recession. The most 
recent depression in the United States was in the late 1920s and early 
1930s. Output and employment stagnate, waiting for the next expansion.
 
✓ Expansion/Recovery: After the economy starts growing again, employment 
and output pick up. This period of expansion and recovery pulls the 
economy off the floor of the trough and points it back toward its next 
peak. During this period, employment, production, and output all see 
increases, and the economic situation again looks promising.

 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behavior
How do you know which part of the business cycle the economy is in? 
Officially, you don’t usually find out until months after that part of the cycle 
has either started or ended. The National Bureau of Economic Research 
(NBER) officially declares the peaks and troughs. The NBER is responsible 
for formally announcing the ends of peaks and troughs and signaling when 
a recession (end of a peak) or expansion (end of a trough) starts. You can 
see a table explaining the peaks and troughs since 1857 at www.nber.org/
cycles/cyclesmain.html. The NBER identified December 2007 as the 
peak of the most recent economic expansion, but did not make that pro-
nouncement until December 2008. By the time the peak was declared, the 
market had been in a downtrend for 15 months, including the sharp selloff in 
September 2008.
 
As you can see, the time lag between events and when the NBER makes its 
announcements can be lengthy. But it can get worse. For example, the NBER 
declared on November 26, 2001, that the peak of the current business cycle 
was reached March 21, 2001. That was eight months later. But then, in January 
2004, the NBER revised its position by announcing that the peak may have 
actually occurred as early as November 2000. The end of the trough for this 
cycle, November 2001, wasn’t announced until July 17, 2003. In other words, 
the economy was in a period of expansion/recovery for 20 months before the 
NBER made it official.
Unfortunately for all concerned, information that the NBER needs to make 
its official announcements isn’t always immediately available. The process 
of collecting economic data and revised preliminary estimates of economic 
activity takes time. Estimates and data don’t become available immediately 
after a particular part of any business cycle ends. As a result, before drawing 
any conclusions, the NBER must wait until it sees a clear picture of what’s 
happening with the economy. Although many economists identify recessions 
and expansions based on at least two quarters (six months) of economic 
data, NBER uses its own models. Still, a growth spurt that lasts one full 
quarter won’t indicate the start of an expansion nor will a decline that lasts a 
quarter indicate the start of a recession. Bearing that in mind, a time lag of 
at least six months is typically required before the NBER even considers 
declaring a recession or a recovery, which effectively renders the official 
announcement useless for traders.
The peak of a business cycle occurs during the last month before some key 
economic indicators begin to fall. These indicators include employment, 
output, and new housing starts. We talk more about economic indicators 
and which of them are critical for traders to watch in the “Understanding 
Economic Indicators” section, later in the chapter. However, because neither 
a recession nor a recovery can be declared until enough data is accumulated, 
finding a way around the time lag in official information is impossible.

70
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Signals that the economy was weakening became clear to the markets as 
early as October 2007, when the major indexes hit their peaks. Looking at 
an earlier business cycle, you can see the whole process. Just as in October 
2007, clear signs that the economy was headed toward a recession were seen 
as early as the spring of 2000, which is when the NASDAQ index hit its peak 
and began its downward spiral. The effects of the recession took a bit longer 
to hit the other major exchanges, but they started a downward trend by the 
summer of 2000. Just like in 2008, job losses had started mounting by mid-
2000, and many economists already were sending alarms that the economy 
was headed into a recession.
Even though the NBER announced the official beginning of that recession 
as March 21, 2001, and the official end of the trough and beginning of the 
recovery as November 2001, no significant recovery was seen in the markets 
until October 2002. Job growth remained anemic as of early 2004. The first 
sign of job growth was seen during the fourth quarter of 2003, after nearly 
three years of job losses. That economic expansion finally picked up steam, 
and ultimately lasted through 2007.
Identifying periods of economic 
growth and recession
Considering the type of lag time between events and official pronouncements, 
we’re sure you’re wondering how you can determine which part of the 
cycle the economy is in and how you can use this information as a trader. 
Most economists attribute changing business cycles to disturbances in 
the economy. Growth spurts, for example, result from surges in private or 
public spending. One way public spending can surge is during a war, when 
government spending increases and companies in industries related to the 
war effort prosper. They often need to increase hiring to fulfill government 
orders. Employees at these companies usually receive increases in their 
take-home pay and start spending that extra money. As consumer optimism 
increases, other companies must fulfill consumers’ wants and needs, so 
production and output also increase in companies that are unrelated to 
national defense.
When these same factors work in reverse, the start of a recession is sure to 
follow. For example, a cut in government spending will likely result in layoffs 
at related industrial plants, reduced take-home pay, and finally declines in 
output and production to cope with reduced spending.
In addition to government spending, a decision by the Fed to either raise 
or lower interest rates is another major disturbance to the economy. When 
interest rates rise, spending slows, and that can lead to a recession. When 
interest rates are cut, spending usually goes up, and that can aid in spurring 
an economic recovery.

71
 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behavior
Another school of economic thought disagrees with the notion that 
government policy or spending is responsible for changes in the business 
cycle. This second group of theorists believes that differences in productivity 
levels and consumer tastes are the primary forces driving the business cycle. 
From this point of view, only businesses and consumers can drive changes 
in the economic cycle. These economists don’t believe that governmentally 
driven monetary or policy changes impact the cycle.
Which camp you believe is not critical; the key is picking up the signs of 
when the economy is in a recession and when it’s in an expansion. Peaks 
and troughs are flat periods (periods where the high or low stays primarily 
even before moving in the opposite direction) and are impossible to identify 
until months after they end. As a trader, you can identify shifts in buying and 
spending behavior by watching various economic indicators. By doing so, 
you can discover when the economy is in the early stages of a recovery or 
recession or if it’s fully into a recession or recovery.
Relating bull markets and bear 
markets to the economy
You’ve probably heard the terms bull market and bear market. To find out 
what they mean, you first need to understand how economic cycles affect 
the stock market. Bulls are people who believe that all is right with the world 
and the stock market is heading for an increase. They definitely think the 
economy is expanding. Bears are people who believe the economy is heading 
for a downturn, and stocks will either stagnate or go down. A bull market is 
a market in which a majority of stocks are increasing in value, and a bear 
market is a market in which a majority of stocks are decreasing. Bears 
definitely believe the economy is either in a recession or headed that way.
Regardless of whether the bulls or the bears are right, you can make money 
as a trader. The key: Identify the way the market is headed and then buy or 
sell into that trend. During a bear market, traders make their money by 
selling short, or taking advantage of falling prices (more about that in 
Chapter 14). Traders sell short by borrowing stock from their broker and 
then selling it with the hope of making a profit when the price falls.
Even during a bear market, some stocks offer opportunities for traders to 
make money, including oil and gas stocks and real estate investment trusts 
(REITs). Petroleum stocks and REITs pay higher dividends and, therefore, are 
most attractive when the rest of the market is falling or showing no growth 
potential. During a bull market, riding a stock through recovery but getting 
out before a fall is key. We talk more about trends and what they mean in 
Chapter 10.

72
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Sector Rotation
In general, the markets are divided into sectors, and at any given time some 
of those sectors will be expanding, even during a bear market. Some traders 
are adept at rotating their investments from one sector to another that is 
more likely to benefit from the part of the business cycle that is driving the 
economy. This basic trading strategy is called sector rotation.
 
The guru of traders who want to take advantage of sector rotation is Sam 
Stovall, chief investment strategist for Standard & Poor’s, who wrote the 
classic on sector rotation, Sector Investing, in 1996. Although the book is out of 
print, you can still follow his advice about sectors on the BusinessWeek Web 
site at www.businessweek.com/investor.
Stovall developed the Sector Rotation Model shown in Figure 5-2. As you can 
see, he found that market cycles tend to lead business cycles. Markets tend 
to bottom out just before the rest of the economy is in a full recession. The 
start of a bull market, on the other hand, can be seen just before the rest of 
the economy starts its climb toward recovery. Markets reach their tops first 
and enter a bear market before the general economic indicators show a peak.

As a trader, you can take advantage of this knowledge by knowing which sec-
tors are more likely to rise during the various parts of a market cycle. You 
need to buy into the sectors with stock prices that are likely to rise, or you 
can sell short the sectors in which prices are expected to fall. We discuss 
short selling in Chapter 14.

73
 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behavior
Early recovery
You can spot an early recovery when consumer expectations and industrial 
production are beginning to rise while interest rates are bottoming out. That 
scenario was evident during a recent economic cycle discovered during the 
fall and early winter months of 2003. During the early stages of recovery, 
Stovall found that industrial, basic industry, and energy sectors tend to take 
the lead.
Full recovery
When the economy has fully recovered, you start seeing signs that consumer 
expectations are falling and productivity levels and interest rates are flattening 
out. These factors were seen during the economy’s recent period of full 
recovery leading up to the economic peak in December 2007. During that 
period, companies in the consumer staples and services sectors exhibited a 
tendency to take the lead, and interest rates had actually started to fall. As 
knowledgeable investors know, when that happens, it’s only a matter of time 
before a recession follows. Investors know that the staples of life are needed 
even in times of recession, so the stocks of those companies tend to benefit.
Early recession
When the economy reaches the earliest part of a recession, consumer 
expectations fall more sharply and productivity levels start to drop. Interest 
rates also begin to drop. Most of the 2.5 million job losses during the 2001 
economic downturn occurred during late 2001 and early 2002. During 2001, 
the Federal Reserve cut interest rates 11 times to try to ease the concerns 
about the upcoming recession. The Fed started to raise rates in 2004, but 
then lowered them again in 2007 during the mortgage crisis. At the time of 
this writing, the Fed’s discount rate (the interest rate the Fed charges to 
member banks) was 0 percent. Another key recession sign was the mounting 
loss of jobs in 2008 and early 2009.
Utilities and finance sector stocks are the most likely to see rising prices 
during the first part of a recession, because under those circumstances, 
investors seek stocks that provide some safety (because owning them 
involves less risk) and pay higher dividends. Gold and other valuable mineral 
stocks also look good to investors seeking safety. Though the financial sector 
did not follow this pattern in the 2008 recession, it is still typical to see 
banks, insurance companies, and investment firms perform well during the 
early parts of a recession.

74
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Dissecting sector rotation
Some wag once said that the stock market 
predicted 15 of the last 8 recessions. And 
although it’s true that the market isn’t a terribly 
precise economic prognosticator, that’s sort of 
beside the point. Economic indicators can help 
you understand the big picture, which, in turn, 
can help you make better trading decisions.
Of all the economic tools available, sector 
rotation analysis is probably the most valuable. 
Even if the Sector Rotation Model can’t help 
you identify an economic cycle, it can identify 
sectors and stocks that are ripe for further 
study.
When we trade, we want the strongest stocks 
in the strongest sectors, which is why we 
monitor sector performance carefully. Knowing 
the sectors that are performing best enables 
you to anticipate which sectors are likely to 
begin outperforming and which are likely to 
fade. Using those projections, you can start 
monitoring stocks in those up-and-coming 
sectors. For a sector to outperform, the stocks 
within it must also outperform. You need to be 
monitoring those stocks before they begin their 
runs.
Plenty of data is available to help you separate 
the strongest sectors from the ones that are 
underperforming. Investor’s Business Daily, for 
example, ranks nearly 200 industry groups by 
price performance. Stockcharts.com provides 
a similar capability with its Performance 
Charts (stockcharts.com/charts/
performance). You can also monitor sectors by 
following exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 
such as the Select Sector SPDRs (Standard 
and Poor’s Depository Receipts) at www.
spdrindex.com.
Full recession
Although it may not make much sense intuitively, during a full recession 
is when you first start seeing indications that consumer expectations are 
improving, which is seen by increased spending. However, industrial 
productivity remains flat, and businesses won’t increase their production 
levels until they believe consumers actually are ready to spend again. 
Additionally, interest rates continue to drop, because both business and 
consumer spending are slow, so demand for the money weakens while 
competition for new credit customers grows between banks and other 
financial institutions. During a full recession, cyclical and technology stocks 
tend to lead the way. Investors look to safety during a recession, so companies 
that satisfy that need tend to do best.
Understanding Economic Indicators
The key to knowing where, as a trader, you are during the business cycle is 
watching the economic indicators. Every day that you open your newspaper, 
you see at least one story about how the economy is doing based on various 

75
 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behavior
economic indicators. Popular indicators track employment, money supply, 
interest rates, housing starts, housing sales, production levels, purchasing 
statistics, consumer confidence, and many other factors that indicate how 
the economy is doing.
Economic indicators are useful to your trading. Some are definitely more 
useful than others. We don’t have the space here to describe each of the 
indicators; so instead, we focus on the ones that can provide you with the 
most help in making your trading decisions.
Fed watch: Understanding how 
interest rates affect markets
Watching the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve 
(which includes the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president 
of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and presidents of 4 of the other 11 
Federal Reserve Banks) and tracking what it may or may not do to interest 
rates is almost a daily spectator sport in the business press. Although 
members of the FOMC meet only eight times per year, discussions about 
whether the Federal Reserve will raise or lower interest rates serves as 
fodder for stories published on at least a weekly, if not daily, basis. Every 
time Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke speaks, people look for indications of what 
the Fed may be thinking. Speeches by other members of the Fed likewise 
are carefully dissected between FOMC meetings. Most press coverage will 
shortcut all this by saying the Fed may raise or lower interest rates.
 
The key reason for you to be concerned: A change in interest rates can have a 
major impact on the economy and thus on how you make trades. An increase 
in rates is likely to slow down spending, which can lead to an overall economic 
slowdown. For the most part, when the Fed raises interest rates, it’s because 
the board believes the economy is overheated, which can fuel the risk of 
inflation. An increase in interest rates can reduce spending and thus ease 
overheating. If, on the other hand, the Fed fears an economic downturn or is 
trying to fuel growth during a recession, the board frequently decides to cut 
interest rates to spur spending and growth.
In addition to following press reports covering speeches and Congressional 
testimony by members of the Fed, you can also get a good hint about what 
the Fed is thinking by reading the Beige Book, which is a report compiled by 
the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. Summaries about current economic conditions 
in each of the 12 districts are circulated to Federal Reserve Board members 
two weeks prior to the FOMC meeting, at which monetary policy, including 
interest rates, is set. The summaries are developed through interviews with 
key business leaders, economists, market experts, and others familiar with 
each individual district. You can read the Beige Book online at www.federal
reserve.gov/FOMC/BeigeBook/2008/. You can find out about past FOMC 

76
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
statements at www.federalreserve.gov/fomc. These links give you 
access not only to current issues of the Beige Book and FOMC statements but 
also to information from those two sources dating back as far as 1996. They 
can provide an excellent overview of economic trends and possible shifts in 
Federal Reserve monetary policy.
Money supply
The money supply is a key number to watch, because growth in money 
supply can be a leading indicator of inflation in situations when the money 
supply is greater than the supply of goods. When more money than goods is 
around, prices are likely to rise. Commodities and money traders will want to 
keep close watch over these three aggregates — money supply, inflation, and 
goods and services.
The Fed tracks two monetary aggregates: M1 and M2. M1 includes money 
used for payments, such as currency in circulation plus checking accounts 
in banks and thrifts. Currency sitting in bank vaults and bank deposits at 
the Fed are not part of M1, but instead are part of the monetary base. M2 
includes M1 money plus retail nontransaction deposits, which is money 
sitting in retail savings accounts and money market accounts. You can follow 
the money stock measures for M1 and M2 at www.federalreserve.gov/
releases/h6/Current. When you total the money base, M1 and M2, 
you can track the total amount of money sitting in someone’s account or 
circulating in the economy.
The Fed decided in July 2000 that it no longer would set target ranges for 
growth rates of the monetary aggregates. In the late 1970s, money supply 
drove the Fed’s decision-making process. As money supply grew to what was 
considered out of hand, the Fed kept raising interest rates until they were so 
high that many believe the Fed moves actually caused the recession in the 
early 1980s. After that time, managing interest rates became a higher priority 
than managing money aggregates. The Fed didn’t kill the idea of target ranges 
for the money supply until it was certain that managing interest rates alone 
would help stem inflation. Now that the Fed has proved interest-rate 
management works, it decided it no longer needed to set a target for monetary 
aggregates.
Inflation rate
Several key economic indicators point you toward ways of identifying the 
risk of inflation. The primary overall indicator is Gross Domestic Product; it’s 
released quarterly by the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau 

77
 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behavior
of Economic Analysis (BEA). You can also follow monthly trends by keeping 
your eye out for the Consumer Price Index, the Producer Price Index, and 
Retail Sales Data, as described in the list that follows.
 
✓ Gross Domestic Product (GDP) represents the monetary value of goods 
produced during a specific period in the economy. GDP is released 
quarterly in three different versions. The first version, which includes 
advance data, is released at 8:30 a.m. on the last business day of the 
months January, April, July, and October for the previous quarter. 
Preliminary data is released a month later, and the final numbers are 
released a month after that. GDP is important to traders because it 
indicates the pace at which the economy is growing. In the GDP, you’ll 
find numbers for consumer spending, private domestic investment, 
government or public spending, and the net exports. Essentially, it 
includes all information about labor and property involving business 
activities inside the confines of the United States. If GDP fails to meet 
expectations set by the analysts or exceeds market expectations, stock 
prices will be affected at least temporarily. For a glimpse of what may 
be in store for the future, pay attention to the rate that inventories are 
increasing. It can be a leading indicator that growth is slowing or 
consumer demand is changing. Even though the final official numbers 
are released quarterly, the advance reports and preliminary reports give 
you a good indication of what to expect in the final numbers. You 
can get full details about the GDP reports at http://bea.doc.gov/
national/index.htm#gdp. You can track the release schedule for the 
GDP reports, as well as other government statistical reports, at http://
bea.doc.gov/national/index.htm. Often the report is posted at 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis early in the morning before the actual 
release and embargoed until the official release time, so as a trader you 
may be able to get a heads up before the news is actually reported by 
the press.
 
✓ Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the cost of a representative 
basket of goods and services, including food, energy, housing, clothing, 
transportation, medical care, entertainment, and education. Each type of 
cost is weighted. For example, medical costs are weighted more highly 
in recent years, because they are rising at a faster pace, especially as 
the current population ages. In addition to the broad CPI, a core rate is 
issued that excludes food and energy, which are considered more volatile. 
The core rate is an indicator you can watch for general price shifts. The 
financial markets, in general, look for a rate of increase in the range of 1 
percent to 2 percent; anything higher may be a sign of inflation and can 
cause at least a temporary shock to stock prices. Any shock to stock 
prices obviously can be an opportunity for traders. The CPI is released 
by the Labor Department about 8:30 a.m. around the 15th of each month 
and reflects data from the previous month. You can track the CPI at the 
Web site of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics at 
www.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm.

78
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
 
✓ Producer Price Index (PPI) is thought of more as a basket full of other 
indexes that affect domestic producers, including goods manufacturing, 
finishing, and agricultural and other commodities. The Labor 
Department collects more than 100,000 prices each month from 30,000 
production and manufacturing firms to calculate this basket. The 
markets pay close attention to the index, because even though it isn’t as 
powerful an inflation index as the CPI, it gives traders clues about what 
to expect in the next CPI release. The PPI is released a couple of days 
before the CPI, at 8:30 a.m. usually around the 13th of each month, and 
it reflects data from the previous month. You can track PPI data at 
www.bls.gov/ppi.
 
✓ Retail Sales Data tracks information about (you guessed it) retail sales 
by large corporations and by small mom-and-pop retail outlets. The U.S. 
Census Bureau, which is a part of the Department of Commerce, surveys 
hundreds of firms each month using a random sampling of retail outlets 
that make federal insurance contributions to collect this data, which 
is particularly important whenever you’re trading stocks in the retail 
sector. The survey looks at changes in retail numbers from month to 
month. When the number is a negative number, it means sales levels 
decreased from the previous month. This type of negative news can be 
a shock to stock prices, especially for companies in the retail sector. 
The data is released about two weeks after it’s collected, or at 8:30 a.m. 
about the 12th of each month. You can track it online at www.census.
gov/marts/www/marts.html.
Deflation
In addition to watching the economic indicators discussed in the previous 
section for inflation, traders also need to watch the numbers for signs of 
deflation. Serious concern about the possibility of deflation takes center 
stage when prices start falling. Deflation occurs when a sustained period of 
falling prices takes place. The Great Depression of the 1930s was a classic 
period of deflation. Many economists believe that printing more money cures 
deflation, because (as mentioned earlier in the “Money supply” section) 
increases in the money supply normally lead to increases in prices when 
more money is around than goods to be purchased.
During periods of deflation, increasing the money supply isn’t necessarily 
the answer. Some economists believe injecting more money into the economy 
is risky, especially when production capacity is in excess, and producers 
continue to produce goods even though prices are falling. Whereas, in other 
economic situations, producers commonly stop producing when prices fall.
In early 2004, Japan faced a continuing period of deflation even though its 
central bank had lowered rates to an effective negative interest rate and 
continued printing money in attempts to prop up its sagging pricing structure, 
and yet prices were continuing to drop. Some economists believe the 

79
 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behavior
Japanese experienced a liquidity trap. No matter how much money Japan 
printed, prices continued downward in a deflationary spiral.
With housing prices, commodity prices, and stock prices falling, some are 
concerned that the United States could be headed in a similar direction. In 
fact, while we were writing this chapter in early 2009, one of the arguments in 
favor of the stimulus bill was to ward off a deflationary spiral.
Jobless claims
The Employment Situation Summary, another report from the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics (BLS), is one of the most important leading indicators to 
watch. This report is the first critical economic indicator released every 
month and frequently sets the expectations for the rest of the reports 
that month. For example, signs of a weak labor market reported in the 
Employment Situation Summary usually are a strong indication of poor retail 
sales and other possible negative reports later in the month. The summary 
also breaks down data by industry, such as construction and manufacturing. 
For example, a significant drop in employment numbers for the construction 
sector is a strong sign that the housing starts report will also be negative.
This report can send shockwaves through the financial markets, especially 
if the numbers that are released vary greatly from expectations. Stock prices 
definitely fall whenever the report doesn’t meet expectations or employment 
statistics show signs of weakness. On the other hand, stock prices can rise 
dramatically whenever the report indicates better than expected numbers. 
As is true with any shock to the market, changes in prices are temporary 
unless other indicators also exhibit the same trend or tendency.
 
The reason why the employment report can drive markets so strongly is that 
the information it contains is a timely assessment of the overall market, 
because it includes data that is only a few days old. This report is widely 
recognized as the best indicator of unemployment and wage pressure. Rising 
unemployment can be an early sign of recession, while increased pressure 
on wages can be an early sign of inflation. The report also is a broad-based 
snapshot of the entire labor market, covering 250 regions of the United States 
and every major industry.
The Labor Department (www.bls.gov) releases the report at 8:30 a.m. on 
the first Friday of each month with data for the previous month. The two key 
parts of the report that traders need to watch are
 
✓ Unemployment and new jobs created
 
✓ Average weekly hours worked and average earnings
Another employment indicator traders like to watch is the Employment 
Cost Index (ECI). It’s especially relevant during actual times of inflation or 

80
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
when fear exists that an inflationary period may be imminent. The ECI is a 
quarterly survey of employer payrolls that tracks movement in the cost of 
labor, including wages, benefits, and bonuses. Wages and benefits make up 
75 percent of the index. The BLS surveys more than 3,000 private-sector firms 
and 500 local governments to develop the index. The ECI, which reports data 
from the previous quarter, is released on the last business day in January, 
April, July, and October.
Consumer confidence
Keeping an eye on consumer confidence is another way of casting a glance 
into the future of the market. When confidence is high, consumers are more 
likely to spend. The best overall index for monitoring consumer confidence 
is the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI), which is put out by The Conference 
Board. This index is compiled through a sampling of 5,000 households and is 
widely respected as the most accurate indicator of consumer confidence.
Although minor changes in the CCI are not strongly indicative of a problem, 
major shifts can be a sign of rocky waters ahead. Most people who watch the 
CCI look for three- to six-month trends. The Fed, as an example, looks closely 
at consumer confidence when determining interest rate policy, which as you 
know can greatly affect stock prices. When confidence is trending lower, the 
Fed is more likely to lower interest rates. Stock markets love to hear about 
the Fed lowering interest rates. Confidence levels that are trending higher 
can be a warning of a pending inflationary period. A rapidly rising trend in 
consumer confidence can lead the Fed to raise interest rates to cut off inflation; 
moreover, a rise in interest rates can send stock prices lower.
The Conference Board releases the CCI at 10 a.m. the last Tuesday of each 
month. The biggest weakness of this index is that it isn’t based on actual 
spending data. Instead, it’s a survey of planned spending. You can track the 
CCI online at www.conference-board.org/economics/consumer
confidence.cfm.
Business activity
A number of key economic indicators can give you a good idea of what 
business is doing and how that information may impact the stock markets. 
Key business indicators to watch include
 
✓ The National Association of Purchasing Managers report (NAPM): 
One of the first economic indicators released each month is the NAPM 
report, which surveys purchasing managers and provides reviews 
of new orders, production, deliveries, and inventories. This report is 

81
 Chapter 5: Fundamentals 101: Observing Market Behavior
released at 10 a.m. the first business day of each month and reflects data 
compiled from the previous month. You can track this report online at 
www.ism.ws/ISMReport/index.cfm.
 
✓ Durable Goods Orders: The Commerce Department releases another 
critical economic indicator of business activity in the area of Durable 
Goods Orders. This indicator measures the dollar volume of orders, 
shipments, and unfilled orders of durable goods, or types of merchandise 
that have a life span of three years or more. This report serves as a 
leading indicator of manufacturing activity and can move the stock 
market, especially when its numbers vary from expectations. You can 
track the Durable Goods Orders online at www.census.gov/indicator/
www/m3/index.html.
 
✓ Housing Starts and Building Permits: This report is another that’s 
released by the Commerce Department. It can be a leading indicator of 
the direction the economy will take. When the number of permits rises, a 
positive economic indicator results. About 25 percent of investment dollars 
are plowed into housing starts, and that makes up about 5 percent of the 
overall economy. The report is broken down by regions — Northeast, 
Midwest, South, and West — so you can also get a strong indication of 
the strength of the economy on a regional basis. You can track this 
indicator online at www.census.gov/const/www/C40/table2.html.
 
 You can also track other reports on myriad industries at www.census.
gov/cir/www/alpha.html.
 
✓ Regional Manufacturing Surveys: Each Federal Reserve Bank district 
compiles data from regional manufacturing surveys that can help you 
find a score of indicators including new orders, production, employment, 
inventories, delivery times, prices, and export and import orders. 
Positive reports indicate an expanding economy. Negative reports 
indicate a contracting economy. The two most closely watched are the 
Philadelphia survey at www.phil.frb.org/econ/bos/bosschedule.
html and the Chicago survey at www.chicagofed.org/economic_
research_and_data/cfmmi.cfm. If you’re trading in regional stocks, 
following the manufacturing surveys from the Federal Reserve Banks in 
key regions that you follow can help you determine the direction of the 
economy for the areas most relevant to the stocks you’re trading.
Using the Data
You can see that plenty of data is available, but not all of it is relevant to 
the types of stocks you want to trade. Organizing your data collection and 
tracking the trends can make choosing economic signs and analyzing which 
part of the business cycle is driving the markets easier for you. Here are a 
few steps that can make this task much easier:

82
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
 
1. Maintain a calendar of the release dates for the key economic 
indicators you decide to follow.
 
 The markets may move in anticipation of this data, so if you know that a 
key economic indicator is about to be released, be sure to watch stock 
price trends for the possible impact the anticipated release may be 
having on the market.
 
2. Know the parts of the economy that are most impacted by the 
economic indicators you’re following.
 
 For example, the GDP strongly suggests the path of economic growth, 
but PPI and CPI are strong measures of inflation.
 
3. Know which economic indicators are most important to the market.
 
 For example, in times of inflation, economic indicators that reveal key 
data regarding inflation are the biggest market movers. If the markets 
are worried about growth, the growth components of GDP and other 
indicators will have the greatest potential for moving the markets.
 
4. Know what the market is expecting to see in the numbers.
 
 The actual number is not as critical as whether that number was 
expected by the markets. Surprises are what move the markets.
 
5. Know what parts of the economic indicator are important.
 
 Newspapers may write headlines for shock value, but the parts of the 
index they cover may not be what are critical to your decision making. 
For example, traders know that food and energy components of the CPI 
are volatile, so the more important number to watch is the core CPI, 
which doesn’t include food and energy. The news media may focus only 
on the more volatile number.
 
6. Don’t overreact to a newly announced economic indicator that didn’t 
meet market expectations.
 
 Indicators frequently are revised after they’re initially issued. The 
difference may merely be related to a revision and not an indication of a 
shift in the business cycle. However, be sure to check information about 
revisions to the previous month and how those revisions have impacted 
the current month’s trend.
 
7. Monitor the trends.
 
 On your calendar, keep track of key components of each economic 
indicator that you watch. Follow the trends of the most important data 
components to get a good idea of where the business cycle is headed.
 
Keeping a tight watch on economic indicators is the best way for you to 
determine at what point the economy is in a new business cycle. Waiting for 
official pronouncements is much too late. By the time they’re released, that 
phase of the cycle may be over and a new cycle may be driving the markets.

M
ost traders don’t worry about the fundamentals. These numbers 
include the general economic and market conditions that impact a 
stock, as well as the financial information known about a company’s activities 
and its financial successes and failures. Instead, traders tend to focus entirely 
on technical analysis and trends that can be seen using that type of analysis.
Taking the time to analyze the fundamentals of a stock puts you one step 
ahead of the trading crowd. Using fundamental analysis, you can determine 
how a stock’s price compares with those of similar companies based on 
earnings growth and other key factors, including business conditions. This 
chapter helps you understand critical parts of fundamental analysis and how 
you can use the information gathered from it to make better trading decisions.
When starting a fundamental analysis, select an industry or business sector 
that interests you for possible stock purchases. Sometimes, a particular 
company piques your fancy, and you start your research by looking at 
the major players in that company’s sector or by turning to the sector’s 
fundamentals. Regardless of how you start, you need to narrow down your 
list of the companies you want to compare to the ones that are in similar 
businesses within the sector, so you can find the best opportunity. You also 
want to be sure the stock trades well by looking at its daily volume of trades. 
Stocks with low trading volume can be hard to get into and out of, making 
them riskier stocks.

84
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Most of the tools used in fundamental analysis require you to compare 
at least two companies operating in similar business environments to 
understand the meaning of the information. For the purposes of discussion 
in this chapter, we look at two big players in the home improvement retail 
sector: Home Depot and Lowe’s. If you’ve followed the business conditions 
in this sector, you know that both faced a severe downturn after the housing 
bubble burst in 2007. Although in 2008 they were still building new stores, 
they slowed down their expansions waiting for a better market environment.
Before discovering the tools of fundamental analysis, you first must 
understand how to read key financial statements, including the critical parts 
of the income statement, cash flow statements, and the balance sheet.
Checking Out the Income Statement
The income statement is where a company periodically reports its revenues, 
costs, and net earnings. It’s basically a snapshot of how much a company is 
earning from its operations and any extraordinary earnings that may have 
impacted its bottom line during a specific period of time. From the income 
statement, you’ll be able to determine the impact of taxes, interest, and 
depreciation on a company’s earnings and to forecast earnings potential.
Every income statement has three key sections: revenue, expenses, and 
income. The revenue section includes all money taken into the company by 
selling its products or services minus any costs directly related to the sale 
of those products or services (called cost of goods sold). The expenses 
section includes all operating expenses for the company not directly related 
to sales, as well as expenses for depreciation (writing off the use of equipment 
and buildings — tangible assets), amortization (writing off the use of patents, 
copyrights, and other intellectual property or intangible assets), taxes, and 
interest.
The income section includes various calculations of income. Usually you’ll 
find one calculation that shows income after operating expenses and before 
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization called EBITDA. This will be 
ollowed by net income, which is the bottom line showing how much a 
company earned after all its costs and expenses have been deducted. Public 
companies must file financial reports with the SEC on a quarterly and annual 
basis. You can read any company’s financial reports at the Edgar Web site 
(www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml).
A year’s worth of figures won’t show you much, so you need to look at the 
trends throughout a number of years to be able to forecast growth potential 
or assess how well a company is doing compared with its competitors. We 
discuss a number of good sources for finding fundamental information in 
Chapter 4.

85
 Chapter 6: Digging Into the Critical Parts of Fundamental Analysis
Both quarterly and annual reports are important. Comparing a company’s 
results on a quarter to quarter basis gives the trader an idea of how well 
the company is meeting analysts’ expectations as well as the company’s 
projections. Also, for example, looking at results for the first quarter of 2008 
versus the first quarter of 2009, you can see whether a company’s earnings 
are increasing or decreasing in a similar market environment. While for some 
types of companies the first quarter is generally productive, other types of 
companies, such as retail stores, are dependent mostly on fourth-quarter 
holiday results, so you need to know what is expected in earnings for the 
various quarters. Quarterly results allow you to monitor results from similar 
time periods.
Annual statements give you a summary for the year. You can also compare 
current year results to the results over a number of years to see at what rate 
the company is growing.
Revenues
The first line of any income statement includes the company’s sales revenues. 
This number reflects all the sales that have been generated by the company 
before any costs are subtracted. Rather than go to all the trouble of showing 
their math — gross sales – any sales discounts, adjustments for returns, or 
other allowances = net sales — most companies show only net sales on their 
income statements. From these figures, you want to see obvious signs of 
steady growth in revenues. A decrease in revenues from year to year is a red 
flag that indicates problems and that it is probably not a good potential 
trading choice.
Cost of goods sold
The cost of goods sold (also known as cost of merchandise sold or cost of 
services sold — depending on the type of business) is an amount that shows 
the total costs directly related to selling a company’s products or services. 
The costs included in this part of the revenue section include purchases, 
purchase discounts, and freight charges or other costs directly related to 
selling a product or service.
Gross margins
The gross margin or gross profit is the net result of subtracting the cost of 
goods sold from net sales. This figure shows you how much money a 
company is making directly from sales before considering other operating 
costs. The gross profit is the dollar figure calculated by subtracting costs 

86
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
of goods sold from net revenue. The gross margin is a ratio calculated by 
dividing gross profit by net revenue. Watching year-to-year trends in gross 
margins gives you a good idea of a company’s profit growth potential from its 
key revenue sources.
You can calculate a gross margin ratio by dividing a company’s gross profit 
by its net sales:
Gross margin ratio = Gross profit ÷ Net sales
The gross margin ratio, expressed as a percentage, considers revenue from 
sales minus the costs directly involved in making those sales and is a good 
indicator of how well a company uses its production, purchasing, and 
distribution resources to earn a profit. The higher the percentage, the more 
efficient a company is at making its profit.
 
By comparing gross margin ratios among various companies within the 
same industry or business sector, you can get an idea of how efficient each 
company is at generating profits. Investors favor companies that are more 
efficient.
To give you an idea of how to use this ratio and others in this chapter, we 
compare figures from two of the leaders in the home improvement retail 
sector — Home Depot and Lowe’s. Tables 6-1 and 6-2 present the gross 
profits section from the past three annual income statements (information 
taken from Yahoo! Finance) for each respective company. Table 6-3 compares 
the gross margin ratios for the two companies.

You can see that Lowe’s is slightly more efficient at using its production, 
purchasing, and distribution resources than Home Depot, because Lowe’s 
has consistently higher gross margin ratios. Both corporations, however, 
show a trend toward improvement. The advantage of using this ratio, rather 
than the actual revenue and profit numbers for comparison, is that it makes 
comparing large companies with small companies within the same business 
or industry sector much easier. Even though Home Depot’s sale volume is 
considerably higher, the ratio enables you to compare how efficiently each 
company uses its resources.
Expenses
 
The next section of the income statement shows the expenses of operating 
the business, including the sales costs and administrative costs of business 
operations. When comparing a company’s year-to-year results, you need to 
watch for signs of whether expenses are increasing faster than a company’s 
gross profits, which can be an indication that a company is having a problem 
controlling its costs and won’t bode well for future profit growth potential.
When you see expenses drop from one year to the next, while gross margins 
increase, that’s usually a good sign and means a company likely has a good 
cost control program in place. The potential for growth in future profit 
margins is good.
Gross profits and expenses that rise at about the same rate is neither a 
significant positive nor negative sign. When that happens, the best way to 
get a reading on how a company is controlling its expenses is to compare its 
expenses with the expenses of other companies in similar businesses.
Interest payments
The interest payments portion of the expense section of an income statement 
gives you a view of a company’s short-term financial health. Payments shown 
here include interest paid during the year on short- and long-term liabilities 
(more about those in the “Looking at debt” section, later in the chapter). 

88
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
These payments are tax-deductible expenses, which help reduce a company’s 
tax burden.
To determine a company’s fiscal health, use the interest expense number 
and the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) number, which is usually 
shown on the income statement. If not, you can calculate it by subtracting 
interest and tax expenses from operating income (which will be gross profit 
minus expenses, also usually shown on the income statement). You can use 
this figure to determine whether the company is generating sufficient income 
to cover its interest payments using the interest coverage ratio. You can 
calculate the company’s interest coverage ratio (expressed as a percentage, 
this ratio provides a clear-cut indicator of company’s solvency) using this 
formula:
Interest coverage ratio = EBIT ÷ Interest expenses
 
Companies with high interest coverage ratios won’t have any problems 
meeting their interest obligations, and their risk of insolvency (going belly up) 
is low. On the other hand, a low interest coverage ratio is a clear sign that a 
company has a problem and may face bankruptcy. Whether an interest 
coverage ratio tends to run high or low depends a great deal on the type of 
industry or business a company is in. Comparing the interest coverage ratios 
of several companies in the same industry or business is the best way to 
gauge, or judge, the value of the ratios.
Table 6-4 shows annual EBITs and interest expenses from three successive 
annual income statements for Home Depot, and Table 6-5 shows the 
corresponding numbers for Lowe’s.

Lowe’s is in a stronger position to make its interest payments, but neither 
company is in trouble. Lowe’s has almost 20 times more income than it needs 
to make its interest payments and Home Depot has 10.5 times more income 
than it needs. Home Depot has taken on a lot more debt since 2006 when it 
had almost 66 times more income than it needed. Analysts generally consider 
a company in trouble whenever its interest coverage ratio falls below 3.
Tax payments
Corporations are always looking to avoid taxes, just like you. The income tax 
expense figure on the income statement shows the total amount that a 
company paid in taxes. A corporation pays between 15 percent and 38 percent 
of its income in taxes, depending on its respective size; however, corporations 
have many more write-offs they can use to reduce their tax burdens than you 
have as an individual taxpayer. Most large corporations have teams of tax 
specialists who spend their days looking for ways to minimize taxes. When 
looking at tax payments, reviewing how well the company you’re interested in 
manages its tax burden compared with other similar companies is important.
Dividend payments
Companies sometimes pay a dividend, or part of the company profits, for 
each share of common stock that an investor holds. This dividend is 
distributed to shareholders usually once every quarter after the company’s 
board of directors reviews company profits and determines whether to pay 
and how much the dividend will be. Paying dividends is not a tax-deductible 
expense for companies that pay them. In the past, traders have preferred 
growth stocks that do not pay dividends. However, recent changes in the way 
dividends are taxed may have altered the way traders view dividend-paying 
stocks. Dividends used to be taxed based on one’s current income tax rate, 
making long-term capital gains more attractive, but now the tax on dividends 
is capped at 15 percent. This change is set to expire at the end of 2010, so it 
may soon disappear as an advantage.

Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Testing profitability
You now can use the income statement to quickly check your company’s 
profitability by using one or both of two ratios — the operating margin and 
net profit margin. The operating margin looks at profits from operations 
before interest and tax expenses, and the net profit margin considers earnings 
after the payment of those expenses.
You calculate operating margin using this formula:
Operating margin = operating income ÷ gross profit or net sales
You calculate net profit margin using this formula:
Net profit margin = earnings after taxes ÷ gross profit or net sales
Table 6-7 shows the gross profits, operating incomes, and earnings after 
taxes from three successive annual income statements for Home Depot, and 
Table 6-8 shows the corresponding numbers for Lowe’s.

You can see from the numbers in Table 6-9 that Lowe’s did slightly better 
than Home Depot in the year ending February 2008. The mortgage mess of 
2007 definitely had a strong impact on both stores. Home Depot’s operating 
margin dropped by 4.6 percent from its year ending January 28, 2007, to its 
year ending February 3, 2008. Lowe’s saw a downturn as well from 2007 to 
2008, but slightly less at 3.7 percent. The drop in income for Home Depot 
after taxes are figured in was 3.1 percent between 2007 and 2008. Lowe’s drop 
in income was 2.4 percent. The reason that checking operating and net profit 
ratios is a good idea: Doing so shows you the impact of taxes and interest on 
a company’s profits.
Looking at Cash Flow
When you review income statements, you’re looking at information based 
on accrual accounting. In accrual accounting, sales can be included when 
they’re first contracted, even before revenue from them is collected. Sales 
made on credit are shown even if the company still needs to collect from the 
customer. Expenses are recorded as they’re incurred and not necessarily as 
they’re paid. However, the income statement definitely does not show a 
company’s cash position. A company that’s booking a high level of sales can 
have a stellar income statement but nevertheless be having trouble collecting 
from its customers, which may put that company in a cash-poor situation. 
That’s why cash flow statements are so important.
You can get an idea of your favorite company’s actual cash flows from the 
adjustments shown on its cash flow statement. The three sections to this 
statement are operating activities, investment activities, and financial 
activities. Cash flow statements are filed with the SEC along with income 
statements on a quarterly and annual basis.

92
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Operating activities
Looking at cash flow from operating activities gives you a good picture of the 
cash that’s available from a company’s core business operations, including 
net income, depreciation and amortization, changes in accounts receivable, 
changes in inventory, and changes in other current liabilities and current 
assets. We talk more about these accounts in the “Scouring the Balance 
Sheet” section later on.
Calculating cash flow from operating activities includes adjustments to net 
income made by adding back items that were not actually cash expenditures 
but rather were required for reporting purposes. Depreciation is one such 
item. Similarly, expenses or income items that were reported for accrual 
purposes are subtracted out. For example, changes in accounts receivable 
are subtracted out, because they represent cash that has not been received. 
Conversely, changes in accounts payable represent payments that have not 
yet been made, so the cash still is on hand.
The bottom line: This section of a company’s cash flow statement shows 
actual net cash from operations. Table 6-10 compares three successive years 
of cash flow from operating activities at Home Depot and Lowe’s.
Table 6-10

6,484,000
Lowe’s
4,247,000
4,502,000
3,842,000
Looking at the numbers in Table 6-10, you can see both Lowe’s and Home 
Depot’s cash position dropped from 2007 to 2008. Home Depot’s drop was 
more significant at $1.9 billion. If you’re thinking about purchasing Home 
Depot stock, you’d certainly want to look more closely at cash flow changes 
in operating activities to find out why it dropped so significantly in 2008. No 
doubt the economic climate was tough, but Home Depot faced a much more 
significant drop than Lowe’s.
Depreciation
For all companies, one of the largest adjustments to cash flow is depreciation. 
Depreciation reflects the dollar value placed on the annual use of an asset. 
For example, if a company’s truck will be a useable asset for five years, then 
the cost of that truck is depreciated over that five-year period. For accounting 

93
 Chapter 6: Digging Into the Critical Parts of Fundamental Analysis
purposes on its income statement, a company must use a method called 
straight-line depreciation, a method of calculating depreciation in which 
the company determines the actual useful life span of an asset and then 
divides the purchase price of that asset by that life span. Each year 
depreciation expenses are recorded for each asset using this straight-line 
method. Although no cash is actually paid out, the total amount of 
depreciation is added back to the cash flow statement.
For tax purposes, companies can be more creative by writing off assets much 
more quickly and thus reducing their tax burdens at the same pace. One 
type of write-off — dealing with Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code — 
enables a company to deduct the full cost of an asset during its first year of 
use. Other methods enable a company to depreciate assets sooner than the 
straight-line method, but not as soon as the 100 percent permitted by Section 
179. How a company depreciates its assets can have a major impact on how 
much that company pays in taxes.
 
Although you won’t know how a company depreciated its assets by looking at 
its cash flow statement, you will know the adjustment made for depreciation 
for cash purposes. Remember that depreciation is an expense that must be 
reported on an income statement . . . and not a cash outlay.
Financing activities
The financing activities section of a cash flow statement shows any common 
stock that was issued or repurchased, during the period the report reflects, 
and any new loan activity. The financial activities section gives you a good 
idea whether the company is having trouble meeting its daily operating 
needs, and as a result, is seeking outside cash. You won’t, however, find that 
new financing always is bad. A company may be in the process of a major 
growth initiative and may be financing that growth by issuing new debt or 
common stock.
The bottom line: This section of the cash flow statement shows a company’s 
total cash flow from financing activities. Table 6-11 compares three succes-
sive years of cash flow totals from financing activities at Home Depot and 
Lowe’s.

Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
A negative cash flow from financing activities usually means that a company 
has either paid off debt or repurchased stock. In this case both Home Depot 
and Lowe’s repurchased stock in 2008. A positive cash flow here usually 
means new stock or debt was issued. Both companies issued new debt during 
this period as well. Obviously, many combinations of various financing activities 
can affect the bottom line, but the key for traders is to gain an understanding 
of why the change occurred and whether the company’s reason for making 
the change was solid enough to improve its profit and growth picture.
Investment activity
This section of the cash flow statement shows you how a company spends 
its money for growing long-term assets, such as new buildings or other new 
acquisitions, including major purchases of property, equipment, and other 
companies. It also shows you a company’s sales of major assets or equity 
investments in other companies. Tracking investment activities gives investors 
a good idea of what major long-term capital planning activities have taken 
place during the period.
The bottom line: This section shows a company’s total cash flow from investing 
activities. Comparing three successive years of investment activities by Home 
Depot and Lowe’s, Table 6-12 indicates that both companies had significant 
capital outlays that more than likely were for opening new stores in 2006 and 
2007. If you’ve followed the news about these two major home-improvement 
players, you know they’re expanding the numbers of their stores around the 
country in a battle for market share. Home Depot did slow its expansion efforts 
in 2008 and decided to sell off some of its non-retail assets, which is reflected in 
the cash inflow of $4.8 billion in 2008 rather than a cash outlay that year.

Scouring the Balance Sheet
The balance sheet gives you a snapshot of the company’s assets and liabili-
ties at a particular point in time. This differs from the income statement, 
which gives you operating results of a company during a particular period of 
time. A balance sheet has three sections, including

95
 Chapter 6: Digging Into the Critical Parts of Fundamental Analysis
 
✓ An assets section that details everything the company owns
 
✓ A liabilities section that details the company’s debt or any other claims 
on the company’s assets made by debtors
 
✓ A shareholder’s equity (also called owner’s equity) section that lists all 
the claims made by owners or investors
The balance sheet gets its name because the total assets of the company 
are supposed to equal the total claims against it — total liabilities plus total 
equity.
Assets and liabilities are listed on the balance sheet according to their 
liquidity, or how quickly and easily they can be converted into cash. Assets 
or liabilities that are more liquid appear first on the list, while the ones that 
are increasingly more difficult to convert to cash — long-term assets or 
liabilities — appear later. The asset section is divided into current assets (the 
ones that are used up in one year) and long-term assets (the ones whose life 
spans are longer than a year), as is the liabilities section — current liabilities 
and long-term liabilities.
Current assets include cash and other assets that can quickly and easily be 
converted into cash — marketable securities, money market mutual funds, 
accounts receivables, and inventories. Long-term assets include holdings 
such as buildings, land, and equipment. Similarly, on the liabilities side, current 
liabilities include any claims against assets that are due during the next 12 
months, such as accounts payable and notes payable. Long-term liabilities 
are claims due in more than 12 months, such as mortgage or lease payables.
Equity accounts include outstanding (remains on the market) preferred 
and/or common stocks and retained earnings. Retained earnings reflect the 
profits that are reinvested in the company rather than paid out to owners or 
shareholders.
Analyzing assets
In analyzing assets, two key ratios to look at are how quickly a company is 
collecting on its accounts receivable — the accounts receivable turnover — 
and how quickly inventory is sold — the inventory turnover.
A two-step process is used to find the accounts receivable turnover. First 
you must find out how quickly a company turns its accounts receivables into 
cash using this formula:
Accounts receivable turnover = sales on account ÷ average accounts 
receivable balance

96
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Then you need to find out how quickly a company collects on its accounts 
by dividing the accounts receivable turnover into 365 to find out the average 
number of days it takes to collect on accounts.
Testing for inventory turnover uses a similar two-step process. First you 
must find out how quickly inventory turns over during the year using this 
formula:
Inventory turnover ratio = cost of goods sold ÷ average inventory balance
Then you need to divide the inventory turnover ratio into 365 to find out 
the average number of days it takes a company to turn over its inventory. 
Comparing these results for the companies you’re considering can help you 
determine how well each company is handling the collection of its accounts 
receivable and the sale of its inventory. Obviously, the faster a company 
collects on accounts or sells its inventory, the better that company is doing 
in managing its assets. You should compare companies in the same industry 
to determine how well a company is doing.
 
Whenever you see accounts receivable rising rapidly, and the number of days 
to collect on those accounts also is rising, that signals a red flag that indicates 
cash problems likely lie ahead. Whenever you see inventory numbers rising, a 
company can be having a hard time selling its product, which also raises a red 
flag, indicating problems ahead.
We’re summarizing these two common ratios so that you know what they 
mean whenever you see them mentioned by analysts. As a trader, you aren’t 
likely to take the time to do these calculations yourself.
Looking at debt
When considering debt, or what a company owes, the two primary ratios 
you want to look at are the current ratio and acid or quick ratio. You can 
quickly calculate the current ratio, which tests whether a company can make 
its payments, by looking at the balance sheet and using this formula:
Current ratio = current assets ÷ current liabilities
Again, like the other ratios in this chapter, you must compare the ratio of 
one company to that of other companies in the same industry. A current 
ratio that’s lower than most other companies in the industry can indicate the 
company is having a problem paying its short-term debts, which, in turn, is 
a strong sign that bankruptcy may be just around the corner. A current ratio 
that’s significantly higher can be a bad sign too, because it can mean the 
company isn’t using its assets efficiently. For these reasons, traders like to 
see companies with current ratios that are close to the industry average.

97
 Chapter 6: Digging Into the Critical Parts of Fundamental Analysis
Luckily, you won’t have to calculate current ratios, because they’re easily 
found on any Web site that includes fundamental statistics. Using Yahoo! 
Finance, we found that Home Depot’s current ratio is 1.253 and Lowe’s is 
1.091.
The acid test, or quick ratio, is almost the same as the current ratio; however, 
the key difference is that inventory value amounts are subtracted from current 
assets before dividing that result by current liabilities. Many financial 
institutions take this extra step because inventories aren’t as easy to convert 
to cash. The acid test ratio is calculated by:
Acid test ratio = (current assets – inventory) ÷ current liabilities
The acid test ratio is primarily of interest to financial institutions thinking 
about making a short-term loan to a company. They look for an acid test 
ratio of at least 1 to 1 before considering a company a good credit risk. Even 
though as a trader you’re not likely to be in the business of making loans, a 
company that has problems getting short-term debt is likely to have problems 
meeting its short-term obligations in the near future. As the market recognizes 
the problem, the company’s share price is likely to drop.
Reviewing goodwill
Goodwill is not a tangible asset but rather is usually collected through the 
years as companies are bought and sold. Goodwill reflects a competitive 
advantage, such as a strong brand or reputation. When one company buys 
another and pays more than the tangible assets are worth, the difference is 
added to the acquirer’s balance sheet as goodwill. In other words, it’s the 
premium in price that one company pays for another.
Determining Stock Valuations
By now the key question you’re probably asking is, “How do I use all this data 
to decide how much I should pay for a stock?” Basically, the value of a stock 
is the amount buyers are willing to pay for the stock and the amount for 
which sellers are willing to sell the stock under current business conditions. 
The actual value of a stock shifts throughout the day and usually in a matter 
of seconds when the trading volume is high.
Fundamental analysis is one of the tools that investors and some traders use 
to analyze earnings, revenue growth, market share, and future business plans 
so they can determine the value of the stock and the price they’re willing to 
pay for or sell it. Earnings and earnings growth are key factors and are 
considered a part of fundamental analysis. Common ratios used to determine 
a stock’s value include the price to earnings multiple, or P/E ratio; price to 

98
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
book multiple, or price/book ratio; return on assets (ROA); and return on 
equity (ROE). We talk more about how these ratios are calculated in the 
sections that follow.
After considering all this data, investors decide whether a company’s stock 
is undervalued or overvalued. Although past performance is no guarantee 
about a company’s or stock’s future success, fundamental analysts believe 
collecting and analyzing the appropriate data enables investors to make 
more of an educated guess about a stock’s value.
Earnings
Using the income statement, we’ve talked extensively about a company’s 
earnings. Remember the three types of earnings figures to consider are
 
✓ Gross profit, which is calculated after considering the direct costs 
related to sales
 
✓ Operating income, which shows a company’s profit after subtracting 
operating expenses
 
✓ Net income, which is the bottom-line earnings after all expenses, taxes, 
and interest are subtracted
Eyeing the most fundamental data of all
If we were allowed to choose only one piece 
of fundamental data to guide our trading, we’d 
choose the earnings growth rate (you’ll some-
times see this called the EPS Growth Rate — 
EPS stands for earnings per share). You can use 
it as a quick summary of a company’s perfor-
mance. Evaluating the entire financial condition 
of a company isn’t necessary when its earnings 
aren’t up to par.
We don’t put much faith in analysts’ estimates 
and don’t use them when evaluating trading 
candidates. We’re much more interested in 
actual earnings reported than we are in the 
analysts’ estimates for future earnings. And we’re 
interested only in companies whose earnings 
are growing and growing at a faster rate than 
most other companies. Those companies 
typically outperform the broad market.
Investor’s Business Daily is an excellent source 
for EPS growth rate data. A proprietary ranking 
that shows which companies are growing earn-
ings fastest is published in it.
As much as we like this tool, we don’t follow 
the rankings blindly. (And we don’t believe 
the good folks at IBD recommend that you do 
so, either.) IBD doesn’t distinguish between 
companies that are earning more and companies 
that are losing less. That companies can and 
do turn from losing money to making money is a 
fact, and that situation can be lucrative for the 
knowledgeable trader. Call us old-fashioned, 
but we prefer companies that actually have a 
history of reporting real, positive earnings.

99
 Chapter 6: Digging Into the Critical Parts of Fundamental Analysis
 
When you encounter discussions about earnings figures, be certain that you 
know which types of earnings are being discussed for the stock you’re eyeing. 
To be able to compare apples with apples, you must know that you’re using 
the same type of earnings figures.
Earnings growth rate
The earnings growth rate, which shows how quickly the company is expected 
to grow, isn’t something you’ll calculate. What you will find in the fundamental 
analysis statistics for stocks are earnings growth rate projections made by 
industry analysts based on their analysis of a company’s potential earnings. 
The earnings growth rate is included on all the Web sites that we mention 
in Chapter 4 that provide fundamental statistics. When looking for this data, 
be sure to check out the earnings growth rate potential at a number of those 
sites.
Continuing the comparison of Home Depot and Lowe’s, Yahoo! Finance 
projected
 
✓ Home Depot’s earnings growth rate was at –24.3 percent
 
✓ Lowe’s earnings growth rate was at –7.9 percent
Clearly, at this point in time, analysts believe Lowe’s will lose less than Home 
Depot in the future, but they expect losses at both companies.
Figuring Your Ratios: Comparing 
One Company’s Stock to Another
In this section, we show you how to calculate four key ratios — P/E, Price/
Book, ROE, and ROA — but luckily you can find all these where fundamental 
statistics are reported (newspapers, Web sites, and so on — see Chapter 4 
for more). Each of these ratios gives you just one more piece in the puzzle of 
determining how much you want to pay for a stock. By comparing each of the 
ratios for each of the companies you’re considering, you can make a more 
educated case about the price you want to pay for any stock.
Price/earnings ratio
The P/E ratio is probably the one that’s quoted more often in news stories. 
This ratio reflects a comparison of a stock’s earnings with its share price. 
You calculate this ratio using this formula:

100
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
P/E ratio = stock price ÷ earnings per share
You’ll probably find two types of P/E ratios for a stock. The trailing P/E is 
based on earnings reported in previous quarters, and the forward P/E is 
based on projected earnings. At Yahoo! Finance, the trailing P/E for Home 
Depot was 12.29, and its forward P/E, expectations as of February 3, 2010, 
was 13.68. Lowe’s trailing P/E was 12.28, and its forward P/E, expectations 
as of February 1, 2010, was 14.16. There is much difference in the trailing P/E 
ratios for Home Depot and Lowe’s, but analysts seem to favor Lowe’s with a 
higher forward P/E. Historically, market analysts believed a P/E ratio of 10 to 
15 was reasonable. For a while, much higher P/Es were tolerated, but during 
the 2008 market conditions, people drifted back to historical P/Es. When 
comparing companies, you can get a good idea of how the market values 
each stock by looking at its P/E ratio. While the P/E ratio is actually a percent, 
it is rarely stated that way. However, you will sometimes hear it called a price 
multiple because the P/E ratio represents how much you are paying for each 
dollar of a company’s earnings.
Price/book ratio
The price/book ratio compares the market’s valuation of a company to the 
value that the company shows on its financial statements. The higher the 
ratio, the more the market is willing to pay for a company above its hard 
assets, which include its buildings, inventory, accounts receivable, and other 
clearly measurable assets. Companies are more than their measurable assets. 
Customer loyalty, the value of their locations, and other intangible assets 
add value to a company. Investors looking to buy based on value rather than 
growth are more likely to check out the price/book ratio. Price/book ratios 
are calculated using this formula:
Price/book ratio = stock price ÷ (book value – total liabilities)
Lowe’s price/book ratio at Yahoo! Finance was 1.88 and Home Depot’s was 
2.26. Based on price/book ratio, the market is willing to pay a higher premium 
for Home Depot’s stock.
Return on assets
Return on assets (ROA) shows you how efficiently management uses the 
company’s resources. ROA, however, doesn’t show you how well the 
company is performing for its stockholders. To calculate return on assets, 
use this formula:
Return on assets = earnings after taxes ÷ total assets

101
 Chapter 6: Digging Into the Critical Parts of Fundamental Analysis
Home Depot’s ROA at Yahoo! Finance was 7.78 percent; Lowe’s was 8.89 
percent. Lowe’s is doing a more efficient job using its resources based on 
those two ROA numbers.
Return on equity
Investors are more interested in return on equity (ROE), which measures how 
well a company is doing for its shareholders. This ratio measures how much 
profit management generates from resources provided by its shareholders. 
Investors look for companies with high ROEs that show signs of growth. You 
calculate ROE by using this formula:
Return on equity = earnings after taxes ÷ shareholder equity
Home Depot’s ROE was 14.40 percent, and Lowe’s was 15.51 percent.
The ROEs show that Lowe’s is doing a better job for its shareholders, which, 
again, is reflected in the price investors are willing to pay for its shares.
As a trader, you may not make your buy and sell decisions based on 
fundamental analysis, but collecting and having access to this information as 
part of your arsenal certainly helps you to make better and more informed 
stock choices. Knowing a company has strong fundamentals helps to back up 
what you’re seeing in the technical analysis (see Part III). If you’re trying to 
decide between two stocks whose technical charts are positive, you can use 
the fundamental analysis to tip the scale toward your best trading opportunity.

S
tock analysts are supposed to be independent oracles who help mere 
mortal traders understand a company’s financial future. Don’t count 
on them, however, because they’re not always looking to protect the small 
investor’s pocketbook.
Scandals exposed by then New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in the 
early 2000s showed how analysts recommended stocks to the public to 
help their companies land lucrative investment banking deals, while at the 
same time privately writing and sending e-mails calling those same stocks 
junk. (This is the same Spitzer who, after becoming New York Governor, 
was exposed on an FBI wiretap for patronizing high-priced prostitutes. He 
should have stuck with the high-priced stock analysts.) Whenever you read 
recommendations from an analyst, you must determine whether that analyst 
is a buy-side analyst, sell-side analyst, or independent analyst before you 
ever consider using the information he or she is providing.
Analysts get much of their information from conference calls sponsored 
by companies when they report their earnings or make other key financial 
announcements. Today, individual investors are invited to listen in on more 
and more of these calls. You can find out a great deal about a company’s 
prospects by listening in on analyst calls, but the language of these calls can 
be confusing. This chapter explains the types of analysts, their importance, 
and the language unique to what they do. We also introduce you to resources 
on the Internet that can make listening in on analyst calls easier.

104
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Getting to Know Your Analysts
If you watch any of the financial news cable television stations, you’ve 
probably seen numerous industry analysts frequently touting certain stocks 
and panning others. Do you know who those analysts represent? Do you 
know whether they’re independent analysts, buy-side analysts, or sell-side 
analysts? Before deciding whether to follow an analyst’s recommendations, 
be sure that you understand who pays his or her salary and what’s in it for 
him or her.
Buy-side analysts: You won’t see them
You rarely come in contact with a buy-side analyst, because they work 
primarily for large institutional investment firms that manage mutual funds or 
private accounts. Their primary role is analyzing stocks that are bought 
by the firm for which they work and not necessarily the ones bought by 
individual investors. Their research rarely is available outside the firm that 
hired them. Buy-side analysts focus on whether an investment that’s under 
consideration is a good match for the firm’s investment strategy and portfolio. 
In fact, buy-side analysts frequently include information from sell-side 
analysts as part of their overall research on an investment. You’re most likely 
to hear from a buy-side analyst if you listen to analyst conference calls. They 
tend to be much harsher on the company officials.
Sell-side analysts: Watch for conflicts
When you read stock analyses from brokerage houses, you’re more than 
likely reading information from sell-side analysts. These analysts work 
primarily for brokerage houses and other financial distribution sources 
where salespeople sell securities based on the analysts’ recommendations.
The primary purpose of sell-side analysts is providing brokerage salespeople 
with information to help make sales. As long as the interests of the investor, 
the broker, and the brokerage house are the same, sell-side analysts’ reports 
can be useful sources of information. A conflict arises, however, when sell-side 
analysts also are responsible for helping their brokerage houses win investment 
banking business.
New York State AG Spitzer exposed why this conflict is a primary reason for 
all the scandals you’ve read about regarding star analysts, such as Henry 
Blodget of Merrill Lynch, whose e-mails privately called stocks “dogs,” 
“toast,” or “junk” at the same time he and his team were publicly recommending 

105
 Chapter 7: Listening to Analyst Calls
that their customers buy the same stocks. Why do this? Well, according to 
Spitzer’s charges, Blodget’s recommendations brought in $115 million in 
investment banking fees for Merrill Lynch, and Blodget took home $12 million 
in compensation.
Merrill Lynch was only the first to be exposed. Similar charges were raised 
against many other firms, including Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, and Credit 
Suisse First Boston. Few firms that sell stocks and have an investment 
banking division avoided the scandal. These companies didn’t learn much 
from the scandals. Merrill Lynch was taken over by Bank of America because 
of errors made during the mortgage crisis.
At one time in the distant past, analysts were separated from investment 
banks by what companies called a “Chinese Wall.” Analysts’ work supposedly 
was kept completely separate from deals that were being generated in a 
company’s investment banking business. At some point, the lines between 
the two broke down and analysts actually were included in the process of 
generating deals for mergers, acquisitions, and new stock offerings. By 
writing glowing reports, analysts helped their companies sign more lucrative 
investment banking deals, all the while putting their small investors at great 
risk of losing all their money by buying the recommended stocks. When the 
market bubble burst in 2000, many of the stocks that were recommended 
because of these deals, particularly in the Internet, telecommunications, and 
other high-tech industries, dropped to being worthless, and investors lost 
billions.
Merrill Lynch, in trying to settle their problems with Spitzer, agreed to publicly 
disclose its investment banking connections and list its clients. As of June 
2002, Merrill Lynch began stating in all its research reports whether it 
received or will receive fees for investment banking services from any 
company that was followed by the Merrill Lynch analysts in the prior 12 
months. Other companies followed Merrill Lynch’s lead in settling their 
disputes with Spitzer.
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally stepped 
into the fray in April 2002 and announced it was broadening the investigation 
into analysts’ roles and was developing new regulations regarding analyst 
disclosure. The SEC ultimately endorsed rulemaking changes recommended 
by the New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities 
Dealers, including the following:
 
✓ Structural reforms that increase analysts’ independence. These reforms 
include a prohibition on investment banking departments supervising 
analysts or approving research reports.
 
✓ A prohibition on tying analysts’ compensation to specific investment 
banking transactions.

106
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
 
✓ A prohibition on offering favorable research to induce business for the 
firm.
 
✓ Increased disclosures of conflicts of interest in research reports and 
public appearances. These disclosures include information about 
business relationships with or ownership interests in companies that 
are the subjects of analysts’ reports.
 
✓ Disclosure in research reports of data concerning a firm’s ratings, such 
as the percentage of ratings issued in each of the buy, hold, and sell 
categories, and a price chart comparing the rated securities’ closing 
prices and the firm’s rating or price targets over time.
 
✓ Restrictions on personal trading by analysts in securities of companies 
that they analyze and/or report on.
 
Today, rules are made by FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority). 
These rule changes helped investors identify conflicts of interest that can 
compromise the objectivity of the sell-side analyst’s report. Pay close attention 
to the disclosures and the relationships between the brokerage houses and 
the companies that their analysts’ reports cover. Take these connections into 
consideration when including their buy or sell recommendations in your plans 
for future stock transactions.
Independent analysts: Where are they?
You are probably wondering where these independent analysts — people who 
you can trust who don’t have investment banking connections — really are. 
Although they do exist, most work for wealthy individuals or institutional 
investors and provide research for people who manage portfolios of much 
more than a million dollars and pay fees of at least $25,000 per year.
No one really knows exactly how many independent analysts are out there. 
Estimates range from 100 to several hundred, but their ranks surely will grow 
now that independent research will be a required part of selling to individual 
investors.
 
In addition to independent research that you probably see distributed by 
your brokerage house, as a small investor you can turn to some of the major 
investment research firms such as Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) 
and Standard & Poor’s (www.standardandpoors.com). They offer services 
to individual investors through their publications and Internet sites at more 
reasonable fees than many of the small independent analyst firms. 
Nevertheless, you need to bear in mind that even these analysts are answering 
to the companies or wealthy individuals that pay the greatest share of their 
costs.

107
 Chapter 7: Listening to Analyst Calls
The Importance of Analysts
No matter which analyst’s report you’re reading, you must remember that 
the analyst’s primary income is coming either from the brokerage house or 
the large institutional clients that he or she serves. Analysts rate stocks on 
whether you need to consider purchasing them, but no standardized rating 
system exists. The three most common breakdowns that you can expect to 
see are shown in Table 7-1.
Table 7-1 
Common Stock Recommendations from Analysts
Analysis by Company A
Analysis by Company B
Analysis by Company C
Buy
Strong Buy
Recommended List
Outperform
Buy
Trading Buy
Neutral
Hold
Market Outperformer
Underperform
Sell
Market Perform
Avoid
Market Underperformer
You can see from this table that you must understand how a company’s 
analysts rate stocks for that company’s recommendations to have any value. 
Company A’s “Buy” recommendation is its highest, but Company B uses 
“Strong Buy” for its highest rating, and Company C uses “Recommended List” 
for its top choice. Merely seeing that a stock is recommended as a “Buy” by a 
particular analyst means little if you don’t know which rating system is being 
used.
 
Unfortunately, when it comes to stock analysts, if the information is free, it’s 
probably no better than that free lunch you’re always looking to find. 
Someone has to pay the analyst, and if it isn’t you, you must find out who is 
footing the bill before you use that advice to make decisions.
The best way to use analysts’ reports is to think of them as just one tool in 
your bucket of trading tools. Analysts are one good way to find out about an 
industry or a stock, but they’re not the final word about what you need to do. 
Only your own research using fundamental and technical analysis can help 
you make your investment decisions. We discuss fundamental analysis tools 
in Chapters 5 and 6 and technical analysis tools in Part III.

108
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Tracking how a company’s doing
Analysts are good resources for finding historical data about how a company 
or industry is doing. Their reports usually summarize at least five years of 
data and frequently provide a historical perspective for the industry and the 
company that goes back many more years. In addition, analysts make pro-
jections about the earnings potential of the company they’re analyzing and 
indicate why they believe those projections by including information about 
new products being developed or currently being tested at various stages of 
market development.
 
These reports help you track how a company is doing so you can find the 
gems that may indicate when to expect a company to break out of a current 
trading trend. For example, if an analyst covering a pharmaceutical company 
mentions that a new drug is under consideration by the Food and Drug 
Administration, you may look for news stories about the status of that drug 
and monitor the stock for indications that drug approval may soon be 
announced. Watching the technical charts may help you jump in at just the 
right time and catch the upward trend as positive news is announced. Stocks 
usually start to move in advance of news.
Providing access to analyst calls
In addition to reading reports, you can track companies by listening in on 
analyst calls. Some calls are sponsored by the companies themselves to 
review annual or quarterly results, and others are sponsored by independent 
analysts.
Company-sponsored calls
Analyst calls sponsored by companies more often are earnings conference 
calls primarily for institutional investors and Wall Street analysts. They occur 
on either a quarterly, semiannual, or annual basis, and can be the richest 
sources of information concerning a company’s fundamentals and future 
prospects.
Senior management, which usually includes the chief executive officer (CEO), 
president, and chief financial officer (CFO), talks about their financial reports 
and then answer questions during these calls. The calls sometimes are 
scheduled to coincide with announcements of major changes in a company’s 
leadership or other breaking news about the company. After a formal state-
ment, senior management answers questions from analysts. That’s when you 
usually can get the most up-to-date information about the company and how 
management views its financial performance and projections. We discuss 
how to read between these lines and get the most out of these calls in the 
next section of this chapter.

109
 Chapter 7: Listening to Analyst Calls
Access to these calls used to be limited to professional analysts and 
institutional investors, but today more than 80 percent of companies that 
sponsor analyst calls open them to the media and individual investors, 
according to a survey conducted by the National Investor Relations Institute. 
This change primarily is credited to the SEC’s Fair Disclosure (FD) Regulation, 
which requires companies to make public all major announcements that can 
impact the value of the stock within 24 hours of informing any company 
outsiders. This rule helps level the information playing field for individual 
investors.
Analysts no longer can count on getting two or three days of lead time on 
major announcements, which heretofore helped them inform major investors 
about company news. Often that amount of lead time enabled analysts to 
recommend buy or sell decisions to their key clients, but that same practice 
hurt small investors and traders who weren’t privy to the news. Some complain 
this new rule actually hurt the flow of information, because companies clammed 
up in private conversations with analysts, making it harder for the analysts to 
write their investigative reports. Since the regulation first took effect in 2000, 
the fair disclosure rule helped to level the information playing field.
Seeking insider information
Investors began seeking insider information 
about companies long before the scandals 
that you now read about almost daily. In fact, 
one of the first stories ever told about trading 
on insider information involved the start-up of 
one of today’s leading financial information 
services — Reuter’s. Julius Reuter started his 
news service in response to the desire inves-
tors had for insider information and how it 
could impact stock prices. In 1849, Reuter used 
trained homing pigeons to fly information about 
closing stock prices from Europe’s mainland 
across the English Channel to England, thus 
giving his subscribers a jump on news about a 
stock so they‘d be able to react before other, 
less informed investors received the informa-
tion. This story highlights a simple but power-
ful secret of investing: Information is power. 
Investors with privileged access to information 
hold a distinct advantage over other investors 
who don’t have the same access.
Just to give you an idea of how insider informa-
tion was used by analysts more recently, here 
are a couple of examples. In February 1999, 
during a tour of the headquarters of Compaq 
Computer Corporation, the company’s treasurer 
told a group of big-time investors that he was 
concerned about softness in the software indus-
try. Compaq shares dropped 14 percent before 
most individual investors ever discovered such 
a concern existed. In September 1999, execu-
tives at Apple Computer, Inc., called analysts 
to alert them that an earthquake in Taiwan dis-
rupted the production of iBook and Powerbook 
notebook computers. The Apple execs wanted 
to warn analysts that the company would not 
meet its numbers for the quarter. The stock fell 
7 percent in four days, and again, by the time 
most investors found out, it was too late. The 
new SEC fair disclosure rule prevents this kind 
of favored treatment for insiders.

110
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
Independent analyst–sponsored calls
Firms that provide independent analysis also sponsor calls primarily for their 
wealthy and institutional clients. During these calls, analysts often discuss 
breaking news about a company or an industry that they follow. Doing so 
gives their clients an opportunity to discuss key concerns directly with the 
analysts. Unless you’re a client, opportunities for listening in on these calls 
are rare.
Listening to Analyst Calls
Most company conference calls start with a welcome to all call participants, 
followed by a discussion of the financial results being released or the pur-
pose the company has designated for the call. After the CEO, president, and 
CFO make their statements, other key managers may comment on the results 
before the call is opened to questions from the listening audience.
The question-and-answer portion of the call usually is the most revealing 
and enables you to judge just how confident senior managers are with their 
reporting. The question-and-answer part of the call is when you’re most likely 
to hear information that hasn’t been revealed in press releases or formal 
annual or quarterly reports. Analysts and institutional investors usually are 
given the first shot at asking questions, meaning before other listeners, the 
press, or individual investors get their turn. Not all companies permit 
individual investors to ask questions. Even when you can’t ask any questions, 
listening to responses to the questions posed by analysts, institutional 
investors, and the media still is worthwhile.
 
Be sure to listen closely to how the company’s senior managers answer those 
questions. Chances are good that any question you may have will be answered 
during the question-and-answer period. If not, you can always write or call the 
company’s investor relations division to get an answer to your specific question.
Understanding the analysts’ language
Before ever listening to your first call, you must familiarize yourself with the 
language used during the calls. Most of the common terminology is discussed 
in Chapter 6, including earnings per share (EPS), EPS growth, net income, 
cash, and cash equivalents, but not other terms that are unique to the analyst 
call world. These include:
 
✓ Hockey stick: When companies say their revenues come in like a 
hockey stick, company officials are not exactly talking about getting hit 
with a puck. Instead, they’re talking about the shape of a hockey stick. 
What they mean is that because most of their revenues are booked in 

111
 Chapter 7: Listening to Analyst Calls
the final days of the quarter, revenue charts take on the appearance of a 
hockey stick. Most companies, in fact, book revenues this way, because 
sales incentives are designed to encourage the sales force to close their 
contracts before the end of a quarter. Salespeople have to meet their 
quotas, and companies that are planning purchases frequently delay 
those decisions until near the end of a quarter so they can negotiate 
the best deals when the salespeople are most desperate to make a deal. 
You’ve probably done the same thing yourself when buying a car or 
other major item.
 
✓ Lumpy: Nope, the CEO isn’t talking about poorly cooked oatmeal 
whenever he or she says revenues or orders were lumpy. This term 
means that sales were uneven during the quarter, with some weeks 
having low order rates and others having high order rates. The key is 
finding out why sales were lumpy and whether lumpy sales are normal 
for the company.
 
✓ Run-rate: Don’t worry, you won’t be asked how fast you can run a race. 
The run-rate is the way senior management talks about how its current 
performance can be projected over a period of time. For example, if the 
current quarter’s revenues show a $1 million monthly run-rate, then you 
can expect annual revenues to total close to $12 million. This concept 
may work for companies with steady earnings but not for companies 
whose products primarily are seasonal. For example, if a retail company 
reports a run-rate of $1 million per month during the fourth quarter, 
which of course includes holiday sales, you won’t expect that performance 
to be indicative of a full 12-month performance. You must be certain that 
you understand a company’s revenue picture before counting on run-rate 
numbers.
 
If you hear other terminology that you don’t understand, write it down so you 
can research it and thus be ready for the next time you hear it.
Developing your listening skills
In addition to what senior management is saying, you also need to listen to 
how they’re saying it. If management is happy with the results, they’ll prob-
ably be upbeat and talking about a rosy future for the company. On the other 
hand, if management isn’t so happy with the results, the mood probably will 
be downbeat and apologetic as they try to explain why the company didn’t 
perform as expected and, of course, make excuses for their failure to meet 
expectations.
Learn to listen and read between the company lines. Try to listen in on every 
earnings call. The first one you hear may not mean much unless you know 
how the results differ from previous reports and projections. Before that first 
call, you need to read analysts’ reports and become as familiar as possible 
with the company’s earnings history. After you’ve followed a certain company’s 

112
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
calls for a while, the information presented will mean much more to you. 
Among the many indicators that may help you determine your trading 
activity are signs relating to earnings expectations, revenue growth, analysts’ 
moods, company facts, and future projections.
Earnings expectations
Whether a company is meeting its own projections and analysts’ expectations 
is the most important clue about how a company is doing and how the stock 
market will react to its periodic reports. If the company fails to meet 
expectations, the market will likely punish the stock by driving the price 
down, and that can point to a good trading opportunity. If you believe the 
setback is temporary and the company’s long-term prospects look good, you 
may want to wait for the stock to bottom out before buying it. If you think 
failing periodic expectations is a sign of long-term bad news, and you hold a 
position in the stock, you may want to sell it as soon as possible. If you don’t 
own it, you may want to consider shorting the stock. We discuss shorting a 
stock at length in Chapter 18.
Revenue growth
Listen for information that indicates whether revenue growth kept pace 
with earnings growth. This factor becomes even more critical whenever the 
economy slows down, because a company may play with or manipulate the 
numbers in a practice that’s known as window dressing, or making sure that 
earnings meet expectations. However, manipulating revenues is much more 
difficult. Growth in revenues is the key to continued earnings growth in the 
future.
Although manipulating earnings may be difficult, we’ve seen companies do 
it successfully for at least a few quarters and, in some cases, a few years. 
A number of companies caught in recent Wall Street scandals successfully 
manipulated these numbers with creative methods of booking revenue. One 
account that you may want to watch for signs of revenue manipulation is 
accounts receivable. If receivables rise dramatically above historical balances, 
one of two things are likely — the company is having a hard time collecting 
on its accounts or the company is booking fictitious revenue. Manipulation 
may also be detected when a company reports revenue for items sold that 
actually is greater than the company has the capacity to produce.
 
You may notice analysts questioning revenue-growth figures in great detail. 
This examination by analysts can be a sign that they may suspect problems 
with the numbers. Detecting any of these signs while listening to a call can be 
a sign of possible trouble ahead, and you need to take a closer look before 
buying the stock or holding what you already have.

113
 Chapter 7: Listening to Analyst Calls
Analysts’ moods
You can find out a great deal about how analysts are responding to a company’s 
report by merely listening to the tone of their questions. By listening to how 
analysts are asking questions and what questions they are asking, you can 
judge whether the analysts are downbeat on company prospects, especially 
if they’re asking increasingly probing questions. On the other hand, you may 
notice that analysts are upbeat and encouraging senior management to talk 
even more positively about their results and future plans. When you’ve 
followed the analysts’ calls for a company during several quarters, recognizing 
whether the mood has changed won’t be difficult. When analysts receive 
news positively, they often start their questions with some kind of 
congratulatory remark.
Be sure to jot down the names of analysts, especially the ones making positive 
remarks. The positive remarks from analysts with sell-side orientation may 
not be as good a sign as the positive remarks from buy-side analysts. If you 
don’t know what type of analyst is commenting, research his or her affiliations 
and leanings after the call.
 
Buy-side analysts carry the most weight whenever they’re indicating a positive 
reaction to the company’s financial news. Many buy-side analysts who attend 
analyst calls already have a stake in the company, so they have a vested 
interest in putting a positive spin on the news. If they’re positive, they’ll likely 
revise their earnings estimates upward, which can be the first indication that 
they’ll recommend additional buys and the stock may be getting ready to 
enter an upward trend. This positive spin can give you the first sign of a good 
trading opportunity, so watch your technical analysis for any signals of a 
potential breakout. We discuss more about breakouts in Chapter 10.
Just the facts, ma’am
The best way to judge whether senior management is confident in their 
reporting is determining how quickly they respond to questions. If senior 
managers are confident with their numbers, they respond to questions 
quickly, taking little time to think their responses through. If senior 
managers are unsure of their reports, they’re more likely to take a good deal 
of time checking through their papers to answer even the simplest questions. 
You definitely need to think twice about buying or holding stock in a company 
whose management shows a lack of confidence in reporting their numbers.
The future
You’re likely to get a good reading about how senior managers view the 
company’s future prospects by listening to their vision for the company and 
whether the results actually demonstrate that they are fulfilling that vision. 
When managers are successfully fulfilling their vision, they clearly articulate 

114
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
their view of the company’s future and how they plan to get there. Ask 
yourself whether management inspires you with its vision. If not, managers 
most likely are not inspiring their employees, which can be an early sign that 
the company is heading on a downward trend.
Employee satisfaction
Happy employees are a good sign that a company will be able to meet its 
future expectations. If, during the call, you hear that the company is having 
trouble attracting new employees or retaining its existing staff, you may be 
looking at a sign of trouble on the horizon. High employee turnover is bad 
for future growth, and so is having trouble finding and recruiting qualified 
employees.
 
Analyst conference calls are best used as a research tool and not for taking an 
immediate action based solely on the information you gather from them. You 
need to consider them as just one more way of gaining more knowledge about 
a stock that you’re thinking about buying, or of tracking stocks after you’ve 
already bought them. Day traders and swing traders sometimes use the 
information from analyst calls to trade after hours, but such trades can be 
highly risky. We talk more about these two trading strategies in Chapters 16 
and 17.
Locating Company Calls
Many companies list information about their upcoming earnings reports and 
analyst calls on their company Web sites, while others simply post an audio 
version after the event. Some companies offer their investors a service that 
alerts them to upcoming events. If these services are not available for the 
companies you plan to follow, your best way of tracking upcoming calls is 
through one of two online sites: VCall (www.investorcalendar.com) and 
Best Calls (www.bestcalls.com).
VCall is the leading Webcaster for official investor relations events. Many 
companies use its services to run their events online. This Web site offers 
you free access to live and archived corporate communications. In addition 
to the calls, you can find copies of financial information released by the 
company. VCall also enables you to set up e-mail alerts for the companies 
you track that are served by VCall.
Best Calls is the leading resource site for locating earnings conferences on 
the Internet. Although VCall is the leading provider for companies that play 
host to calls, the only company calls that are listed on VCall’s site are for 
companies that use its services. Best Calls, on the other hand, is the largest 
single source for tracking analyst call schedules with links to the location for 

115
 Chapter 7: Listening to Analyst Calls
these calls and access to archived calls. Thousands of companies list their 
conferences and analyst calls on this site, and you can set up an e-mail alert 
for any company you want to follow. Best Call charges membership fees to 
access the entire site and fees for transcripts of older calls. You may be able 
to find a link for free from the investor relations section of a company’s Web 
site.
Identifying Trends in the Stock 
Analyst Community
The new regulatory climate in Washington now drives changes in the stock 
analyst community following disclosures of the abuses exposed after the 
stock bubble that ended in 2000. The Financial Disclosure Regulation of 2001 
(Regulation FD) controls the flow of information between companies and 
analysts and ultimately what information makes its way to you as an outside 
investor or trader.
Some traders believe that the new restrictions that ban selective disclosure 
to friendly analysts or key investors actually hurt the flow of information to 
the general public. Regulation FD requires that any information disclosed 
to analysts or key investors that can affect the value of the company must 
be disclosed to the general public within 24 hours, even if the information 
wasn’t part of a planned report.
The preference is for making announcements about material information at 
the same time for everyone, but sometimes during meetings with an analyst 
or institutional investor information is shared inadvertently. For example, if 
analysts find out information during a company tour, the company then is 
required to put out a press release disclosing the same information to the 
general public. Some analysts believe this is making the preparation of their 
reports much more difficult than it needs to be.
Regulation FD, however, halted some commonplace industry practices, 
including closed meetings with analysts and institutional investors. Lawyers 
for many companies warn senior managers to be careful about responding to 
calls from individual analysts. Some companies require that any contact with 
analysts first be evaluated and approved through their legal advisors.
Regulations also impact roadshows, which are marketing tours that introduce 
a company’s new securities offerings. The SEC permits these events but 
gives clear guidance that they now need to be more like oral offers that are 
designed to avoid the prohibition against written or broadcast offers made 
outside the official prospectus of the offering. The SEC believes these road-

116
Part II: Reading the Fundamentals: Fundamental Analysis 
shows are best conducted in the open to all investors and has voiced 
objections to having two separate roadshows, one for institutional investors 
and another, more sanitized version, for retail investors. Some legal experts 
also advise companies to be careful about whether they include outside 
analysts, those not employed by the underwriter of the offering, as part of 
the roadshow. Including outside analysts, some believe, can be viewed as 
selective disclosure, which violates Regulation FD.
 
The biggest regulatory changes you’ll see as an individual investor or trader 
relate to disclosures that must be made in research reports, including a 
requirement that securities firms must disclose any compensation they 
receive for investment banking services they provide during the three months 
following the public offering for a covered company. In addition, firms that are 
members of the New York Stock Exchange or the National Association of 
Securities Dealers must disclose when they stop coverage of a public company. 
Many times this type of news generates unfavorable publicity for the company 
and can result in a drop in stock prices. In addition to these big disclosures, 
analysts’ research reports now must include information about the relationships 
between the analysts, underwriters, and stock issuer.
Operating in this type of fish bowl may make companies and analysts 
nervous, but it nevertheless should level the playing field for individual 
investors. Look carefully for these disclosures as you read analysts’ reports 
and take advantage of your newfound access to information by attending 
analysts’ earnings conferences and being part of the insider pool rather than 
a passive outsider waiting to be fed information by the financial media or 
professional analysts.

Technical Analysis Work?

E
veryone knows that foretelling the future is a tough thing to do, especially 
when money is involved. Whether your prognosticating tool of choice 
is a Ouija board or a Magic 8 Ball, knowing exactly what the future holds is 
difficult.
Investors and traders are always looking for an edge in forecasting stock 
prices to improve their trading results. The method of choice for many 
investors is fundamental analysis, which we describe in Chapters 5, 6, and 7. 
For traders, on the other hand, technical analysis, as described here and in 
Chapters 9–11, is the way to go.
Although some overlap exists between fundamental and technical analyses, 
you find dyed-in-the-wool, true believers in both camps, and they argue 
that their way is best, even going so far as to say the opposite way is worse 
than useless. For our money, the truth lies somewhere in between these two 
extremes.
Understanding the Mythology
A technician — that’s someone who reads charts — believes that you can 
use price charts and market statistics to develop a profitable trading plan. 
Some technicians even say that price charts foretell where a stock’s price 
is heading simply by showing where it has been. Detractors argue that 

120
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
technical analysis is merely another name for fortune telling, a charlatan’s 
moniker that avoids entanglements with local authorities and the Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC).
Had Miss Cleo, that deposed temptress of tarot cards, made her living 
foretelling stock prices, she might still be in business. Likewise, had she 
lived in earlier times, she might have been revered by the masses and the 
high priests for her fortune-telling skills instead of being scorned as a fraud.
In ancient Rome, tracking the stars, the planets, and the behavior of birds 
was popular, and so was inspecting the entrails of sacrificial animals. 
Although a bit gruesome, the haruspex — that’s the expert gut checker — 
was highly regarded. As an augur, an official diviner in ancient Rome, Miss 
Cleo would have been consulted to foretell events and reveal the gods’ 
reactions to any future courses of action. She would have been in the limelight 
and riding as high as she was right before the FTC brought her into check. 
Although it may have been bogus, Miss Cleo couldn’t have hoped for more.
In spite of Miss Cleo’s fate, fortune-tellers still ply their trade. Are the most 
successful the ones who divine future price movements by reading the 
entrails of stock price charts? That’s what a cadre of academic financial 
experts thinks. To the uninitiated, price charts are merely squiggles and lines 
on a page. The academics apparently believe, just like augurs of old, that 
technicians track those squiggles and lines as a means of predicting price 
behavior and attempting to divine a particular stock’s future course of action.
Thankfully, the market entrails viewed by technicians aren’t as gruesome as 
the ones analyzed by the haruspex. Nevertheless, academics and fundamental 
analysts often regard technicians in the same light as haruspices — little more 
than an expert gut checker — but the analogy isn’t really valid. Technical 
analysis is not a forecasting tool. It is a trading tool and nothing more.
Understanding the Methodology
 
Although technicians try to anticipate the future and make trading plans 
based on price-chart squiggles, technical analysis is a far cry from reading tea 
leaves or tarot cards. Instead of predicting the future, technical analysis is 
used to identify events that are likely to occur, and to make trading plans in 
case they do, and alternative plans in case they do not. Technicians use a 
logical framework to identify price trends, turning points, trading ranges, and 
breakouts. These important trading concepts are covered in Chapters 9 
through 11.

121
 Chapter 8: Reading the Tea Leaves: Does Technical Analysis Work?
 
To understand the technical analyst’s methods, you need to be familiar with 
these technical analysis concepts:
 
✓ Everything is in the price.
 
✓ Price movements are not (always) random.
 
✓ Price changes are caused by an imbalance between supply and demand.
Finding everything in the price
The stock market is so efficient that everything that’s currently known about 
a company is priced into its stock. In other words, the current price reflects 
the combined wisdom of everyone in the market, including corporate insiders, 
pension funds, mutual funds, individual investors, stock analysts, fundamental 
analysts, technicians, and you.
Technical analysis provides a synopsis of all the fundamental and psychological 
factors that affect the price of a stock. Although we personally think putting 
all your eggs in the price basket is taking the point to an extreme, that’s why 
some technicians don’t even try to evaluate the fundamentals. Why bother 
trying to outsmart the smartest when everything’s in the price?
 
The technician’s understanding of why a stock’s price moves is not important. 
Technicians don’t care whether the price movement was caused by the most 
recent analyst’s report or by the flapping of a butterfly’s wings in China. They 
are concerned only with
 
✓ What the price is now
 
✓ What the price history is
Technical analysts examine current prices relative to the histories of price 
movements to understand and plan for what may happen next. Fundamental 
analysts ask why, trying to understand what piece of news causes a particular 
rise in price or what bit of insider knowledge causes a sell off. Technicians 
try to see everything the price represents and base their trades only on what 
they see.
 
You can’t know what causes every ripple in the price continuum. So why try?

122
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Price movements are not always random
Sometimes prices move higher. Sometimes they move lower. And sometimes 
prices move back and forth within a tight trading range. When prices move 
higher or lower, we say prices are trending. The trading-range periods 
between trending periods often appear to be random price movements, and 
at times, they may actually be random. But when you zoom in to view the 
price movements within those seemingly random trading-range periods, you 
will find the trading range is made up of many mini trends. The closer you 
look, the less random these price movements appear, and that is the crux of 
technical analysis. These are important concepts for trading and are covered 
more fully in Chapter 10.
 
At its simplest, technical analysis identifies the periods of time during which 
trends occur. In general, technicians want to base their trades on trending 
markets. The idea is determining when trends are beginning and when they’re 
ending. But which trend? Are you the type of trader who is interested in the 
little mini trends that make up a trading range? Or are you most interested in 
trading longer-lasting trends?
The trick to technical trading, therefore, is identifying a stock’s price trend 
within the time frame during which you want to buy or sell it. Depending on 
the length of time you plan to hold the stock, you want to base your trades on 
analyses done in the corresponding time frame. We are primarily concerned 
with long-lasting trends that span many weeks or months. In that case, you’ll 
want to analyze charts showing daily and weekly prices. If, instead, you 
plan to hold your stock for no more than a few hours or a few days, you’ll 
want to analyze charts showing intraday prices. When looking at intraday 
price charts, you will see many examples of mini trends and trading ranges. 
However, if you’re buying a stock and holding your position for weeks or 
months, those mini intraday trends and trading ranges are meaningless. We 
discuss these concepts more fully in Chapter 9.
Balancing supply and demand
If you’ve ever watched the nightly business news, you’ve probably heard 
reporters claim that stocks rose because more buyers were looking for 
stocks than sellers were willing to part with them. At some level, that’s 
hogwash. Even novice investors realize that every trade must have a buyer 
and a seller.
What the reporter really means is that the supply and demand were out 
of balance and that price is a function of supply and demand. In macro-
economics, this concept is illustrated using a freely traded commodity like 
wheat. When farmers grow more wheat than bakers need, the price of wheat 
falls. When bakers need more wheat than farmers grew, bakers bid higher 
prices to get the wheat they need.

123
 Chapter 8: Reading the Tea Leaves: Does Technical Analysis Work?
 
In many ways, the price of a stock works just like the price of wheat. When 
buyers want to buy more shares of a stock than sellers are willing or able to 
sell, buyers bid the stock price higher until they find sellers willing to part 
with their shares. Conversely, when sellers can’t find enough buyers, they 
offer their shares at lower and lower prices until enough buyers can be found.
Changes in a company’s business plan, a new competitor, anything really, 
can throw the balance between supply and demand out of whack. Realizing 
that imbalances cause prices to move — and not the news itself — is the 
point where technical analysis is concerned.
Understanding where you’ve been
Technicians examine price history, trading volume, and additional market 
statistics to evaluate the balance between supply and demand. The conceptual 
framework is easy to understand. As long as prices are rising, demand 
exceeds supply, and buyers are more interested in buying than sellers are in 
selling. The reverse is equally true. When prices are falling, supply exceeds 
demand, and sellers are more interested in selling than buyers are in buying. 
When a stock trades within a tight range of prices, a balance between supply 
and demand has been achieved. This situation is evident on the price chart 
when a stock trades within a trading range. Examples are shown in Chapter 9.
 
Technical analysis helps identify these kinds of scenarios. Technicians 
examine charts in search of the price levels where buying pressure stops a 
stock’s price from falling further or where selling pressure squashes a rally.
Here’s a hypothetical scenario to illustrate that point. A high-profile investment 
advisor issues a recommendation to buy shares of XYZ, which closed at 
$18.50 the day before and has traded in a tight price range of $17 to $18.75 
during the past four months. The recommendation to buy is in effect only if 
the stock trades for less than $19 a share. The idea is not necessarily to buy 
the instant that a recommendation is made, but rather to buy at a good price.
Taking the hypothetical example a step further, say that the investment 
advisor has a wide following. Invariably, the recommendation is quickly 
followed by a surge in the volume of buyers purchasing shares of XYZ that 
ultimately pushes the price of the stock to $21.
Buying surges based on these kinds of recommendations have a tendency to 
stall out and return to the buy-under price (in this case $19) after all the early 
buyers make their trades. Patient subscribers of this advisor have seen this 
movie many times before, so they wait for a pullback, and place a limit order 
near the $19 price. (Limit orders are discussed in Chapter 2.) Enough patient 
subscribers usually are in the market for the stock to keep its price from 
falling further.

124
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Now imagine that you’re watching this stock without knowledge of the 
investment advisor’s recommendation. The steps that you’d likely see the 
price of XYZ shares take during the course of a week or two include:
 
1. XYZ breaking out of its trading range and rallying on high volume
 
2. XYZ pulling back on low volume
 
3. High-volume buying of XYZ resuming as the price falls near $19
This type of market activity is what technicians wait for. You will see this 
scenario play out over and over again, both in individual stocks, in exchange-
traded funds and in the general market indexes. Chapter 9 covers this 
technique in more detail, but for now, know that it is a textbook example of a 
trading-range breakout defined by the following:
 
✓ A high-volume breakout after a long period of range-bound trading
 
✓ A low-volume pullback
 
✓ High-volume rally to new highs
If you were interested in this stock, you may have taken a position. In fact, 
given this setup, the three logical places where a technician takes a 
position are
 
✓ At the breakout: Buy as soon as the stock trades through the resistance 
at the upper end of the trading range.
 
✓ At the pullback: Buy immediately as the stock begins trading higher 
after the low-volume pullback.
 
✓ At the double top: When the stock retraces the move from the pullback 
to its high price, it’s called a double top. Buy when the stock makes a 
new high for the move.
Of these three alternatives, our favorite is the middle one, because buying at 
the pullback is a relatively low-risk, high-reward trade. Our least favorite is the 
last one, trading the double top as the stock makes a new high, because it is 
the riskiest of the three alternatives. Both the breakout and the pullback trades 
are covered in much more detail, including example charts, in Chapter 9.
As long as technical analysis helps you get a good entry price on your trade 
and keep your losses small, you’ll have a powerful trading tool at your disposal.

125
 Chapter 8: Reading the Tea Leaves: Does Technical Analysis Work?
Understanding where you’re headed
 
Technical analysis helps you find out where in the ups and downs of the 
market buyers took action in the past. If you have a hint where buyers have 
stepped in before, you can reasonably expect that they will do so again in the 
future. When they do as you expect, you need to be able to trade on that 
information profitably.
If they don’t do as you expect, you may have to bust your trade, and yet 
you’ve still discovered a great deal of valuable information. You hope that 
the price you pay for that knowledge isn’t too great, but you nevertheless 
know more than you did before. You know that the last wave of buying 
exhausts demand, and thus you need to begin looking for further evidence of 
a reversal.
You don’t have to adhere to arguments that technical analysis is a good 
forecasting tool merely to recognize that it’s a useful trading tool.
Answering the Detractors
A few arguments against technical analysis actually make some sense, but 
an entire category of lame complaints also exists. For example, some people 
lamely argue that no technicians have been successful over the long run and 
that no technician has mustered the stature or success of illustrious market 
moguls like Warren Buffet, Benjamin Graham, or Peter Lynch.
As if to further this argument, they point to some infamous technician who 
blew up his portfolio in a spectacular fashion. Then a few years later, they 
harp on another well-known technician who made a boneheaded call, and 
then it happened again, and therefore technical analysis is useless.
The impulse to counter these arguments with a list of high-profile fundamental 
analysts who also blew client portfolios, however, is misguided. Even a litany 
of disasters wouldn’t disprove the usefulness of fundamental analysis any 
more than a list of high-profile successes proves that fundamental analysis is 
the only way to make money in stocks. Why, then, should anyone accept that 
either proves technical analysis is useless?

126
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
In fact, many successful technicians have long, profitable trading careers. 
While most toil in self-imposed obscurity, some are prominent and outspoken. 
For example, John W. Henry, who owns the Boston Red Sox, made his fortune 
as a trend-following technician, but missed the mark in the volatility of the 
market in 2006 and 2007, so he lost most of his clients. Additional examples 
include Ed Seykota, a trader with 35 years experience and one of the original 
Market Wizards, and Bill Dunn of Dunn Capital Management, Inc. This is just a 
tiny sample of the many successful independent traders and fund managers 
who employ technical analysis tools to make trading decisions. But they do 
not always read the tea leaves correctly, as we saw with John W. Henry. It’s 
an art — not an exact science.
A related argument about a chart-reading challenge that no technician has 
ever attempted (or would even consider) works like this: The technical 
analyst is given one half of a price chart with all identifying information 
removed. From that information, the technician is supposed to tell whether 
the stock’s price was higher or lower at any point in the second half of the 
chart.
Of course, nobody ever claims the prize for having accomplished this feat, 
and that, therefore, is supposed to be proof that no technician ever has 
enough confidence in technical analysis to even try. Accomplished technicians 
aren’t any better at telling the future than a haruspex or tarot-card reader — 
and neither, for that matter, are fundamental analysts. Technical analysis is 
not fortune-telling, it’s simply a trading tool.
Walking randomly
 
The Random Walk Theory has nothing to do with hiking without a map, but 
instead, is an academic theory that says stock prices are completely random. 
What happened to a stock yesterday has nothing to do with what happens to 
its price tomorrow.
Furthermore, this theory claims that the market is so efficient that consistently 
outperforming broad-based market indexes is impossible. In other words, 
any edge that you may gain from fundamental analysis, technical analysis, or 
tea leaves is useless and expensive. After all, transaction costs far outweigh 
any performance improvement that your analysis provides.
Armed with computer models and reams of study results, academic experts 
cling to these efficient-market hypotheses as gospel. Several challenges 
oppose their argument. No less an authority than the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York published a study showing that using support and resistance levels 
(see Chapter 9) improved trading results for several firms. Additionally, 
articles published in the Journal of Finance suggest that trading based on 

127
 Chapter 8: Reading the Tea Leaves: Does Technical Analysis Work?
moving averages and head and shoulder reversal patterns outperformed the 
market averages. Reversal patterns are discussed in Chapter 9, and moving 
averages are discussed in Chapter 11.
 
So do you think this is proof that technical analysis is effective all the time? Of 
course not. But it casts doubt about the validity of the Random Walk Theory, 
especially the part that technical analysis cannot be used to consistently 
improve results compared to the market averages.
Debating these arguments to a logical conclusion is nearly impossible. Even 
when you use technical analysis successfully, random walkers claim your 
performance is the result of random chance — nothing more than good luck. 
Don’t believe them. Instead, believe that luck favors the prepared mind.
Trading signals known to all
Anyone who cares to look can see exactly the same patterns and has access 
to the same indicators as every other trader. There is nothing new under the 
sun — or in the markets.
Although some traders create proprietary indicators to gain a trading edge, 
many more use well-known off-the-shelf trading tools. The patterns and 
indicators described in Chapters 9, 10, and 11 are all well known. Some are 
freely available on the Internet for anyone to use. Thus, if everyone sees the 
same thing, how can you use those trading signals profitably? The question is 
perfectly legitimate.
Although everyone sees the same patterns and the same indicators, this 
equality is a strength rather than a weakness. Technical analysis gives you 
insight into what future actions you can expect from your fellow market 
participants. With practice, you can use that information to construct a 
consistently profitable trading plan.
 
After you become familiar with traditional patterns and indicators, you can 
incorporate your experience and market knowledge into your trading plans 
and thus come to an understanding about when to use specific tools and when 
results are meaningless. From these plans, you can find out when a trading 
signal works and when it fails. You can make trades based on indicators and 
patterns that help and ignore the rest.
Many widely known indicators and trading patterns exist, but personally, we 
use only a handful of the simplest ones. Your results will differ from ours. 
You may trade in a different time frame than we do, or you may choose a 
different set of tools altogether. As long as your tools improve your trading, 
continue using them.

128
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Telling Fortunes or Planning Trades
Cutting to the chase, you probably guessed by now that you’re never going 
to foretell the future with technical analysis. Technical analysis, instead, is 
simply a useful trading tool.
 
Successful trading does not mean that you have to be right all the time or 
even half the time. You don’t have to tell the future. Technical analysis is an 
excellent tool for managing your money, controlling your losses, and enabling 
your profits to run (see Chapter 12 for more money management information).
Even people who base their trades on fundamental factors can use chart 
analysis to help them time market entry and exit points and gauge price 
volatility and risk. Using technical analysis successfully means
 
✓ Being patient
 
✓ Finding out how to identify and use a small number of patterns and 
indicators
 
✓ Becoming proficient at finding these patterns and profitably trading on 
them
 
✓ Adding methodically to your tool kit to improve your trading results
Remember that no method is foolproof. Nothing ever ensures successful 
trades 100 percent of the time. But technical analysis is an excellent tool for 
improving your trading results.

▶ Distinguishing between trends and trading ranges
▶ Pinpointing transitions from trading range to trend
S
tock charts come in many flavors. Some prominent ones include 
point-and-figure charts, candlestick charts, and the ever-popular bar 
charts, which are used throughout this book.
Bar charts are easy to create, interpret, and maintain. Furthermore, charting 
tools and analysis techniques for bar charts apply to stocks, bonds, options, 
indexes, and futures, and are applicable across any time frame in which you 
may want to trade. In addition, most chart patterns work for long (buy first, 
sell later) and short (sell first, buy later) trades.
This chapter shows you how to draw price charts for a single stock, for an 
index such as the S&P 500 or NASDAQ Composite, or for an exchange-traded 
fund, and recognize simple single-day trading patterns. In addition, you find 
out how to identify trends and trading ranges and how to look for key 
transition points that often lead to good trading opportunities. Charting is a 
visual methodology, so you’ll find many example charts used throughout this 
chapter. Examine them carefully. You’ll want to quickly identify the patterns 
we describe here when evaluating charts for your own trading.
Creating a Price Chart
Traders used to create their charts by hand. Today, however, many charting 
alternatives and options are available, including easy-to-use computer 
software and easily accessible Internet sites, both of which are discussed 
in Chapter 4. You may, of course, still want to create charts by hand; that’s 
something we encourage you to do — at least for a little while. Making 
your own charts is easy, a great way to discover charting concepts, and an 
excellent way of getting a feel for the markets.

130
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
A chart of stock prices shares characteristics with other charts with which 
you’re probably familiar. These kinds of charts typically are made up of two 
axes; the horizontal axis represents time, and the vertical axis represents 
price. One unusual feature of a stock chart is that its vertical axis, the price 
axis, usually is shown on the right, as in Figure 9-1. The most current prices 
are shown on the right-hand side of the chart, and so are the newest trading 
signals. You always trade while those signals are on the right edge of a chart, 
so having the price axis closest to the most crucial part of the chart makes 
sense.

Creating a single price bar
Regardless of whether your chart is an intraday chart (showing fluctuations 
throughout a trading day) or a chart of daily or weekly prices, the format of 
the price bar is the same. Each bar represents the results for a single trading 
period. On a chart that provides daily information, for example, each bar 
represents the results for a single trading day.
Most stock-price bar charts show four important prices on each bar:
 
✓ Open: The price recorded for the first trade
 
✓ High: The highest price trade during the trading period

131
 Chapter 9: Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really)
 
✓ Low: The lowest price trade during the trading period
 
✓ Close: The price recorded for the last trade
By convention, a daily bar chart shows trades for the standard New York 
Stock Exchange (NYSE) trading day — from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. — but some 
charting packages include optional after-hours results (prices from trades 
that occur after the market closes) as part of each daily bar. Likewise, some 
charting packages omit the opening prices on intraday charts. The opening 
price on an intraday chart (almost) always is the same as the closing price 
for the previous bar, so omitting it is of little consequence. However, omitting 
the opening price on daily, weekly, and monthly charts diminishes the 
usefulness of the chart, so avoid charts that don’t provide all four prices.
Figure 9-2 shows a single price bar. The full range of prices traded throughout 
the period is shown by the vertical bar. The opening price is shown as a 
small line on the left-hand side of the bar, and the closing price is shown by a 
similar line on the right-hand side of the bar.
 
Figure 9-2: 
A single 
price bar.
 
High
Close
Open
Low
This identical format is used for all time periods. For example, an intraday 
chart may use 1-minute bars, where each bar spans all the prices for your 
stock that occur during trades over a full minute. Common time frames for 
stock price charts are
 
✓ 1-minute bars: Each bar represents one minute of trading.
 
✓ 5-minute bars: Each bar represents five minutes of trading.
 
✓ 10-minute bars: Each bar represents ten minutes of trading.
 
✓ 15-minute bars: Each bar represents 15 minutes of trading.
 
✓ 60-minute bars: Each bar represents 60 minutes of trading.
 
✓ Daily bars: Each bar represents one full day of trading.

132
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
 
✓ Weekly bars: Each bar represents one week of trading.
 
✓ Monthly bars: Each bar represents one full month of trading.
In our own trading, we typically monitor weekly charts, daily charts, 
one or two intraday charts, and either 60-minute bars for stocks and 
exchange-traded funds or 5-minute bars for indexes. We cover our chart 
selection and methodology more fully in Chapter 13.
Measuring volume
In addition to prices, bar charts often show the volume, or the number of 
shares traded during the given time period represented by each bar. On a 
daily chart, trading volume shows the total number of shares traded 
throughout the day. By convention, the volume is shown as a separate bar 
graph and usually is shown directly underneath the price chart. Figure 9-3 
shows an example.
 
Volume (the number of shares sold) is used as a confirming indicator. In other 
words, if a price bar shows bullish activity (which is discussed later in the 
section on “Identifying Simple Single-Day Patterns”), that bullishness is 
confirmed by a higher-than-average trading volume. However, that bullish 
indication may diminish if trading volume is lower than average.
Volume also is used to gauge institutional participation in a stock. Significant 
trading volume often signals that large institutional investors — mutual 
funds, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, and others — are 
placing orders to buy or sell a stock. When prices rise and volume is strong, 
you usually can infer that institutions are accumulating positions in the 
stock. The reverse also is true. When prices fall and trading volume is high, 
large institutions may be liquidating positions, which is considered a bearish 
development.
Low-volume price changes are less meaningful, at least from a technical 
perspective, than high-volume changes. That’s why technicians say, “Volume 
confirms price.”
Coloring charts
Displaying price and volume bars in color is common on charts. When using 
color, be sure to use contrasting colors so you can distinguish up days from 
down days. One prominent charting package, for example, defaults to green 
for up days and red for down days. A prominent Internet site defaults to 
black for up days and red for down. Most charting services enable you to 
configure colors to suit yourself.

Identifying Simple Single-Day Patterns
The goal of chart reading is determining whether buyers or sellers are in 
control of the price. In a bull market, stockowners may be willing to sell, but 
only if they can coax higher prices from buyers. In a bear market, buyers 
are able to negotiate a better price when sellers are more eager to sell than 
buyers are to buy.
 
You’re trying to infer the market’s underlying psychology by looking at the 
history of price movements. Inferring that as prices rise, buyers are more 
interested in buying than sellers are in selling is a fair observation. In a rising 
market, buyers must continue bidding prices higher to convince sellers to part 
with their shares. Rising prices attract additional buyers, who must continue 
to bid prices higher to convince even more reluctant sellers to part with their 
shares.
Single-bar patterns
The most bullish thing that a market can do is go higher. Although technicians 
typically view each bar within the context of its neighboring bars, each 
individual bar has something to tell the careful observer. Figure 9-4, for 
example, shows a bullish single-bar pattern.

In the example in the figure, buyers bid prices higher throughout the day. 
The opening price of $10 also is the lowest trade for the day. The daily range 
shown on the bar is $2, and the stock closed at $12, the high for the day.
If you’re keeping score (and as a trader, believe us, you are), the bulls gained 
ground and clearly are ahead for the day. Bears holding short positions 
were hurt where it hurts the most — in their pocketbooks. A trader takes a 
short position by borrowing shares of stock and selling them in the hope of 
making money if the stock price falls. This trade loses money if the stock’s 
price rises. The mechanics of selling short are described in Chapter 14. The 
example in Figure 9-4 shows the stock opening at the extreme low and closing 
at its extreme high, but the pattern nevertheless is just as bullish when the 
stock opens near its low and then closes near its high.
Figure 9-5 shows a bearish single-bar pattern. The stock opened at $11.75; 
traded to $12, the high for the day; fell to $10, the daily low; and then closed 
at $10.25. The stock doesn’t have to close at the low for the day for it to be 
bearish. Closing near the low is good enough.

These single-day patterns are helpful to the trader who’s trying to understand 
the underpinnings of the markets. Whether these patterns present a trading 
opportunity depends on the stock’s recent history and whether its trading 
volume confirms the pattern (see the earlier section on “Measuring volume”). 
We give you several examples later in this chapter, in the section “Searching 
for Transitions,” where a bullish single-bar pattern triggers a buy signal.
Reversal patterns
A reversal bar is another single-bar pattern that shows a stock opening and 
closing at the same end of its trading range. Figure 9-6 shows a bullish single-bar 
reversal where the stock opens at the high, trades lower through part of the 
day, and by the close, the stock regains all its losses and closes at its highest 
intraday price.

reversal 
pattern.

During the early part of the trading sessions depicted in the bullish reversal 
pattern, buyers were willing to buy only if sellers lowered their offering 
(asking) prices. By the end of the day, the tide had turned and roles were 
reversed, with sellers willing to sell but only at higher prices. This situation is 
another win for the bulls, because they were able to stop the price slide and 
recover all the intraday losses.
Figure 9-7 shows a bearish reversal pattern. In this case, the stock opens at 
$10.25, rallies during the day to $12, but closes at the $10 low.
 
Reversal patterns often represent a powerful single-bar trading pattern. 
Whenever a bullish reversal bar is preceded by several periods of falling 
prices, for example, its pattern often represents a buying opportunity. On the 
other hand, when a bearish reversal bar is preceded by a rising trend, it may 
be a signal to close a long position or initiate a short position. Selling short is 
described in Chapter 14.

Not all price bars, however, present specific trading opportunities. Some 
bars are neutral by themselves, but add to a stock’s history when viewed 
in context. Through charts, you can use a stock’s visual historical record to 
develop your trading plan, as you’ll see in the following sections.
Identifying Trends and Trading Ranges
Technical analysis helps you identify trends, discovering when one begins 
and ends. Our style of trading, position trading, looks for the persistent trend, 
a trend that lasts for at least several weeks to several months, perhaps even 
longer. Day traders and swing traders who buy and sell in the shortest of terms 
also look for trends to trade. In fact, the distinction between a day trader, 
a swing trader, and a position trader is the length of the trend that each is 
hoping to find. Swing trading and day trading are discussed in Chapters 16 
and 17, respectively. If you’re really interested, check out Swing Trading For 
Dummies by Omar Bassal and Day Trading For Dummies by Ann C. Logue 
(both published by Wiley).
 
Following trends is an effective trading strategy, especially for new traders. To 
follow trends successfully, you first need to identify and distinguish between 
stocks and markets exhibiting trends and their counterparts, trading within 
specific price ranges.
Identifying a trading range
Stocks are either trending up or down or trading within a confined price 
range. The latter are said to be range bound or stuck in a trading range, never 
trading higher than the high nor lower than the low during a specific time 
frame. You also hear range-bound stocks described as consolidating or 
building a base. Although some subtle distinctions may exist among these 
terms, we nevertheless use them interchangeably.

137
 Chapter 9: Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really)
In general, we’re not interested in trading range-bound stocks. Trading 
ranges can persist for long periods of time. Some may even last for years. For 
a position trader, having money in a range-bound stock represents wasted 
opportunity. You won’t lose money, but you won’t make any either. Instead, 
we are interested in identifying range-bound stocks because they have the 
potential to begin trending. We patiently watch these stocks for a signal 
indicating the trading range may end and a trend may begin. Stocks that 
break out of a long-lasting trading range often begin trends that can be traded 
profitably.
Trading ranges are easy to spot after the fact, but anticipating when a stock 
is about to enter or exit a trading range is nearly impossible. For this and 
other reasons, range-bound stocks are difficult to trade, especially for new 
traders. Some short-term traders are able to trade range-bound stocks 
successfully, so it isn’t impossible, but we encourage you first to become a 
proficient trend trader before attempting to trade stocks stuck in trading 
ranges. Tools you can use in trading-range situations are described in 
Chapter 11. In Chapter 10, we discuss what to do if a stock you own stops 
trending and becomes range bound.
Identifying a trading range is best done visually. Figure 9-8 shows a chart of 
Time Warner, Inc. (TWX) stock in a range-bound pattern.
 
Figure 9-8: 
Time 
Warner

stuck in 
a trading 
range.
 
Time Warner spent more than nine months trading between $13.50 and 
$16.50. Notice how the price moves up and down but always between those 
levels, never making much progress one way or the other. Also notice the 
lines drawn on the chart near $13.50 and $16.50. These lines show support 
and resistance levels, respectively, and are discussed in the “Support and 
resistance: Not just for undergarments” section later in this chapter.

138
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Spotting a trend
Now contrast the Time Warner chart in Figure 9-8 with the chart of Ryanair 
Holdings (RYAAY) in Figure 9-9. RYAAY appears quite different from the 
range-bound stock. Notice the steady stair-step march upward as the stock 
rises higher and higher.
Even in a strong upward trend, stocks rarely go straight up. You often 
see some reversals and mini-consolidations in a trend that cause the 
stair-stepped look.
 
That stair-stepped upward march is an identifying characteristic of an uptrend. 
Although defining it quantitatively is possible, seeing an uptrend on a chart is 
easy and that’s the way it often is done. As long as a stock price continues to 
reach higher intermittent highs, and its new lows don’t fall below previous 
lows, the uptrend remains intact. Chapter 10 discusses trends and these 
stair-step patterns in more detail.
 
Figure 9-9: 
Ryanair 
Holdings 
PLC stock 
exhibits 
and upward 
trend 
pattern.
 
Stocks can also downtrend; a series of lower highs and lower lows is as much 
of a trend as its upward-bound counterpart. See Figure 9-10, a chart showing 
Comerica, Inc., in a downtrend.

Time frame matters
The time frame of your chart determines your trading perspective.
You may notice that the price lines of a range-bound stock are made up of 
many small trends. If you look at an intraday chart of Time Warner stock 
(TWX) that spanned the 25 or so days of trading from April 14, 2008, through 
May 15, 2008, TWX appears to be in an uptrend.
In fact, TWX was in a trend during that period. However, when you step back 
and observe a broader historical record of TWX’s trading pattern by looking 
at the daily and weekly charts, you can easily see that the multi-day trend 
actually was confined within the prevailing trading range.
Although short-term swing traders and day traders make a living basing their 
trading on these mini- and microtrends, doing so isn’t our cup of tea. We 
caution you that consistently trading range-bound stocks profitably is very 
difficult to do.
Searching for Transitions
A stock can transition from a downtrend to an uptrend in several different 
ways. It can, for example, fall precipitously, turn on a dime, and begin heading 
higher. Furthermore, a stock can fall, bounce around in a trading range for a 
while, and begin a new trend — up or down — as it breaks from the trading 
range.

140
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Although turning on a dime from downtrending to upward trending sometimes 
presents profitable trading opportunities, these transitions are difficult to 
identify, and are even more difficult to base a trade on. Additional tools of 
technical analysis to unearth these transitions are explained in Chapters 10 
and 11. Rather than trying to score big on sharp transitions, we recommend 
searching for stocks making the transition to trending after a period of 
range-bound trading lasting at least six to eight weeks, preferably longer.
Support and resistance: Not 
just for undergarments
The transition from range-bound to trending is relatively easy to identify 
visually and is the easiest to trade profitably. To find the transition, you must 
be familiar with the concept of support and resistance. You will see support 
and resistance used in many contexts. For example, they are used to identify 
a trading range, as discussed in this section. They are also used to help 
identify when a trend has reached its end, as we discuss in Chapter 10.
For an example of how support and resistance levels are shown on a chart, 
refer to Figure 9-8, the chart showing TWX stuck in a trading range. The 
support line shown on this chart is at approximately $13.50; the resistance 
line is shown near $16.50.
 
Support is always the lower trading-range boundary; resistance is always the 
upper trading-range boundary.
When technicians talk about support, they mean the price where buyers are 
willing to buy enough stock to stop the price from falling. Said another way, 
when sellers see enough buying interest at the support price, they may still 
be willing to sell, but, as for now, they’ll sell only if they can coax buyers to 
raise their bids. Buyers are now eager to buy, so they’re willing to bid a little 
more to complete the transaction. The result: Prices end their descent and 
begin heading higher.
The reverse is true as the stock price approaches the resistance level. Buyers 
begin losing interest as the stock reaches elevated prices. Eager sellers must 
lower their offer (asking) price to complete the transaction, which causes 
prices to stop rising and begin falling.

141
 Chapter 9: Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really)
 
Support levels and resistance levels often are determined visually by means of 
a chart. Knowing the exact price where lines of support and resistance need to 
be drawn is difficult, and traders may differ on where to draw these lines. 
Some choose the extreme, plotting intraday highs and lows of a trading range 
during a specific time frame to establish those levels. We prefer using closing 
prices on a daily or weekly bar chart to define the upper and lower boundaries 
within the trading range. If you’re analyzing an intraday chart, use the last 
trade price on each bar when drawing the support and resistance levels. In 
my opinion, closing prices (or last prices) have more significance and better 
represent the consensus of traders and investors. Ultimately, the choice is 
yours.
 
Let us caution you that technical analysis is not an exact science. And as 
such, thinking of support and resistance levels as areas of support or zones of 
resistance is probably better than viewing them in terms of specific prices or 
single lines on a chart, even though that’s how they appear.
Finding a breakout
A stock remains stuck in its trading range as long as it bounces between 
zones of support and resistance. Short-term traders may be interested in 
these movements, but as a position trader, you’re looking for a more 
substantial trend, so you must wait for something to change the status quo 
and cause the stock to break out of its trading range.
 
A breakout sometimes signals the transition of a stock trading within a range 
to a new uptrend or downtrend. When breaking out to the upside, we want to 
see the resistance zone violated by a significant amount, certainly by more 
than 5 or 10 cents. More important, we want to see the stock trade through its 
resistance zone on much higher volume than the average. Ideally, volume 
needs to be at least 50 percent higher than average. More volume is even 
better.
Figure 9-11 shows a chart of Baxter International, Inc., stock (BAX) and is a 
textbook example of a stock breaking out of a trading range. BAX had been 
trading within a narrow range from mid 2005 through June 2006. We drew 
the support line just above $34.50 and the resistance line near $38.00. The 
support and resistance levels were tested several times in 2006.

Breakout Volume
On July 20, 2006, BAX opened well above its previous close, traded through 
the zone of resistance and closed at $38.88. This pattern — where a stock’s 
opening price is well above its previous close and moves up, breaking out of 
its trading range — is called a breakout gap, which we discuss more fully in 
Chapter 10. Although not a requirement for a stock to break out of its trading 
range, a breakout gap does bolster the case for this rise in prices to be a 
transition from trading within a range to a new uptrend. Trading volume 
was almost 8 million shares, or almost triple the average daily volume of 2.7 
million shares.
As the chart shows, BAX continued to trade higher. Although you cannot see 
it in Figure 9-11, BAX continued its rally through May 2007.
The BAX breakout was an almost picture-perfect setup for a trading opportunity. 
Baxter is a leading stock in a leading industry. The stock built a solid trading-
range base and broke out on higher-than-average volume. Then BAX went 
on to rally for almost a year. Nice. We discuss ways to identify when a trend 
has come to an end, and when to close your trade to realize your profits, in 
Chapter 10.

143
 Chapter 9: Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really)
Waiting patiently for winning patterns
We can hear the gears grinding from here. Yes, it’s a nice trade . . . but you’re 
probably saying to yourself, “Couldn’t I have bought BAX for about $35.00 
several times between February 2006 and June 2006? Why wait until the 
breakout drives my entry price up?”
 
The answer: Finding a good trading signal is important; avoiding bad trading 
signals is more important.
Foretelling the future is hard. Of course hindsight is going to tell you that 
buying BAX at $35.00 would’ve earned you more money than buying it above 
$38. But when the price was $35.00, how could you know that BAX wouldn’t 
stay in its trading range for many more months or years? Or how could you 
tell that BAX wasn’t going to break out of its trading range to the downside, 
and start trending lower?
It happens. In fact, if the stock had traded below its zone of support, technical 
analysis would’ve suggested a potential opportunity to sell BAX short.
Another important reason for waiting for a breakout is that when you enter 
a trade, you need an exit strategy. Exit strategies are discussed more fully in 
Chapters 12 through 14, but for now, know that you need technical signals to 
show you when to exit your position, the same way you needed them to enter 
the position in the first place. If you’re trying to buy stocks at the bottom and 
then sell them at the top, few signals are available to tell you whether your 
entry signal has failed.
Fine-tuning your trading-range breakout strategy
Three ways you can fine-tune your trading-range breakout strategy are
 
✓ Observing that breakouts from long trading ranges tend to result in more 
profitable buying and selling than breakouts from shorter trading ranges.
 
✓ Understanding that breakouts from tight trading ranges, where price 
fluctuations are confined to a relatively narrow price range, usually result 
in better trades than when trading-range price fluctuations are wide.
 
✓ Waiting for a short while — at least one day, possibly two or three — to 
confirm the trading range breakout can be helpful. Waiting to see whether 
the stock falls back into the trading range before you take a position can 
save you from a negative market reaction. Running into a wave of selling 
immediately after a breakout is not uncommon, and the way the stock 
reacts to that selling is just as important as the breakout itself.

144
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
 
Consistently snagging the lowest price is nearly impossible, regardless of 
whether you use technical analysis, fundamental analysis, a Ouija board, or 
follow the best prognosticators in the business. Technical analysis can help 
you find transitions, but it can’t tell the future. As a technician, you never 
(almost never) buy your stocks at their lowest prices, and you rarely exit your 
positions at the highest prices.
 
However, if you wait for a solid trading signal, you can ride the middle part of 
the trend for a large portion of the move. Try not to be greedy. The middle 
part of the trend is a very profitable place to trade.
Sipping from a cup and saucer
Another widely followed transitional formation is called a cup and handle. 
In a cup and handle formation, a stock’s price levels form a rounded curving 
bottom that looks a bit like a cup or a saucer, which often is followed by a 
modest shakeout formation that, if you use your imagination, looks a bit like 
the handle on a coffee cup.
Figure 9-12 shows a chart of the Apple, Inc., stock (AAPL) that illustrates the 
cup and handle formation.

145
 Chapter 9: Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really)
The entry strategy for this pattern is similar to that used for the trading 
range breakout. The trigger occurs when the stock price breaks above the 
handle on high volume. In the Apple example, it occurs in late April, and is 
accompanied by a small breakout gap.
Notice that the stock traded in a very narrow range during the next couple of 
days, retesting the former area of resistance. As often is the case, that former 
resistance level actually provided support after it was crossed. You’ll see this 
phenomenon occur frequently.
The cup and handle is a reliable trading pattern, but that doesn’t mean the 
pattern never fails. It does, and you need an exit strategy for when it does, 
just like every other trade. Exit strategies are discussed in Chapter 12.
Deciding what to do with a double bottom
Another transition pattern that often leads to profitable trading opportunities 
is the double bottom. Visually, a double bottom looks like a “W” on the chart, 
so it is very easy to see. However, a double bottom doesn’t need to form a 
perfect “W” to be valid. In fact, we actually prefer the right-hand trough to be 
a little lower than the left-hand trough. When a minor new low forms, it tends 
to shake out the weakest owners of the stock and makes it much easier for 
bulls to drive the price higher.
Figure 9-13 shows a well-formed double bottom on the Newmont Mining 
Corp. (NEM) stock chart. The left-hand trough occurred in June 2007; the 
right-hand trough in August 2007.
The entry criteria for this pattern are similar to that of the trading-range 
breakout. In this case, the trigger point occurs when the stock breaks above 
the mid-point peak between the two troughs. This peak is sometimes called 
the pivot point. Ideally, higher-than-average volume confirms the trigger.
The trigger price on the chart is just below $43.00, which corresponds to 
the $42.91 close on July 24. The stock gapped above the trigger point on 
September 6 with a volume of more than 15 million shares. That’s 50 percent 
more than the average daily trading volume.
Also notice the bullish single-day bar pattern on the breakout. The stock 
pulled back to test resistance at the mid-point close price, and then rallied.

An alternative double-bottom strategy
One scenario where aggressive traders may want to anticipate the formation 
of a double-bottom pattern is when the “W” is particularly deep and the pivot 
is many points away from the trough. When that happens, taking a position 
as the stock is forming the right-hand trough sometimes makes sense.
If the price holds near or just below the left-hand trough, and volume confirms 
the reversal, then aggressive traders can enter a position. You may also want 
to enter a position if signals from other single-day patterns confirm the 
reversal. The risk is relatively small, and the potential reward is relatively 
large. If the stock falls below the lowest low, you’ll know your trade has failed 
and you must exit. Otherwise, hold the position until the stock tests the pivot 
point (see previous section).
Using the NEM chart in Figure 9-13 to illustrate this strategy, the buy trigger 
occurred on August 16 when NEM showed the single-day reversal pattern at 
the bottom of the trough. Your entry point would be the next trading day, 
and your stop would be below $37.60, the low for that reversal bar.

147
 Chapter 9: Reading Bar Charts Is Easy (Really)
Looking at other patterns
Many other reversal patterns are published in technical analysis books and 
magazines, but the ones in the preceding few sections, we believe, are the 
most reliable.
 
Inexperienced traders always want to find the Holy Grail, that pattern or 
indicator that enables them to profitably trade the turn-on-a-dime “V” pattern. 
In truth, however, “V” bottoms don’t happen all that often. And when they do, 
many reasons express why it’s probably not the best trading opportunity 
available to you. If you talk shop with other traders, you’re certain to hear 
them discuss many esoteric patterns. We know them, but we rarely trade 
them. The simple techniques we’ve shown you in this chapter will enable you 
to trade profitably. There’s no need to look for the esoteric when the simple 
does the job just as well.

▶ Finding areas of support and resistance within a trend
▶ Identifying gaps
▶ Understanding continuation and retracement patterns
▶ Planning for failed trading signals
T
echnical analysis helps you identify new price trends and look for 
endings to existing trends. Being able to identify those two extreme end 
points means you can develop a powerful, profitable trend-following trading 
system. Technical analysis can also help you evaluate the persistence of 
a trend, which is useful for finding secondary entry points and generating 
short-term trading signals.
In this chapter, we discuss trading strategies for several trend-following 
techniques. In addition, methods for identifying continuation patterns, 
retracement patterns, and reversal patterns are discussed, together with 
strategies for dealing with the inevitable failed trading signal.
Identifying Trends
Identifying a trend is relatively straightforward. Instinctively, you know it 
when you see it. Visual techniques and calculated indicators both can be 
used to identify trend signals. We discuss visual identification techniques in 
this chapter. We cover calculated indicators in Chapter 11.

150
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
A steadily rising or falling stock is a trending stock. But if you watch stocks for 
any period of time, you know that they rarely go straight up or down. Instead, 
you see a stair-step effect in which a stock rises several steps and then falls 
back. Talking about a trend as a series of intermittent highs interrupted by 
intermittent lows makes good sense. So an uptrend, then, is a series of higher 
intermittent highs and higher intermittent lows. Conversely, a downtrend is a 
series of lower intermittent highs followed by lower intermittent lows.
Figure 10-1 shows a price chart of Polycom Inc. stock (PLCM) exhibiting a 
series of higher intermittent highs and higher intermittent lows. (From here 
on out, for simplicity’s sake, we call these higher highs and higher lows.)
 
Figure 10-1:

The PLCM example shows the type of trends that you hope follow the 
breakout patterns we discuss in Chapter 9. As long as the pattern of higher 
highs and higher lows continues, you can participate in a profitable trade.
Figure 10-2 shows a downtrending price chart of American International 
Group’s stock (AIG) that identifies its series of lower highs and lower lows. 
You may recall hearing about the government bailout of AIG during the credit 
crisis. You may also notice that the company’s stock performance signaled 
trouble long before the credit crisis began.

Supporting and Resisting Trends
You may have noticed in Figure 10-2 that a higher intermittent high formed 
in the midst of the downtrend exhibited by the chart. That anomaly is 
identified as a retracement on the chart (see the “Withstanding 
Retracements” section, later in the chapter). It happened again a few months 
later. Although the series of lower highs and lower lows appeared to have 
been broken, AIG’s downtrend remained intact and continued its fall.
 
In an uptrend, as long as the pattern of higher highs and higher lows 
continues, you can say that the trend persists. The converse (lower highs and 
lower lows) is true in a downtrend. Unfortunately, you cannot say that breaks 
in these patterns signal the end of any trends.
Sometimes you see an uptrend pattern broken when the stock fails to reach 
a new high or when it makes a lower intermittent low. You may actually see 
several of these disconcerting lower lows, only to witness the resumption 
of a strong uptrend. As such, you need to anticipate these eventual hiccups 
as you plan your trading strategy, and you need tools to help you determine 
whether a stock is still trending or the trend has reached its end.

152
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Drawing trend lines to show support
Trend lines are drawn underneath a trend, much as support lines are drawn 
underneath a trading range as described in Chapter 9. And just like the 
support line, trend lines show areas of trading-range support that can be 
used to trigger short-term trading signals as you monitor the progress of a 
trend.
If you remember your days in geometry class, you’ll recall that only two 
points are needed to define any line. Knowing which point to choose is the 
trick when drawing a trend line. You may, for example, choose to have the 
trend line touching two or more of the intermittent lows as is the case in 
Figure 10-3. Or you may choose to draw the trend line based on the lowest 
closing prices between those intermittent lows.
 
Figure 10-3: 
Finding a 
trend line.
 
Trend line
Unfortunately, drawing trend lines is not a precise discipline, and no 
universal consensus exists for where and how to draw them. In fact, any two 
traders drawing trend lines in exactly the same place for the same stock is 
not something you’re likely to find. Furthermore, you’ll drive yourself crazy 
trying to touch all the important lows with your trend line.
Trend lines are drawn to fit historical data. That the trend rides atop the 
trend line is not surprising, given that you drew it that way. However, 
whether that trend line represents the actual trend or is able to generate 
reliable trading signals is constantly in doubt.

153
 Chapter 10: Following Trends for Fun and Profit
There are so many variables. You might, for example, draw the trend line 
on a traditional price scale as we’ve done here, but that trend line will look 
very different from one drawn on a log or semi-log scale that shows 
percentage price changes. It’s hard to know which is the better choice. Also, 
trend lines are often drawn using the oldest historical data, but newer data 
may be more relevant for generating trading signals. As such, constantly 
questioning your information and continually updating your trend line is a 
good habit to follow.
Watching the price bar cross below the trend line can be disturbing, because 
doing so can signal the end of the trend, or it may mean that you need to 
redraw the trend lines. Unfortunately, when the stock price closes below the 
trend line, you can’t know whether the penetration represents the end of the 
trend or just another opportunity to redraw the trend line to conform to the 
newest price data.
 
An alternative technique for drawing the trend line reduces the ambiguity just 
a bit. Instead of drawing the trend line from left to right, the way most people 
instinctively do, draw the trend line backward, or from right to left. Using the 
two most recent intermittent lows in the trend, draw the trend line backward 
as long as it is meaningful, then project the trend line toward the right. This 
approach has a couple of benefits:
 
✓ The slope of the trend line is more closely aligned with the most recent 
trading data, which usually is more relevant to your trading decisions.
 
✓ You’ll resign yourself to the necessity of continually redrawing your 
trend lines based on the newest data.
Surfing channels
A channel is used by traders to identify potential entry and exit points during 
a trend. Channel lines are formed when a line is drawn parallel with the trend 
line across a trend’s intermittent highs. This top channel line is analogous 
to the resistance line in a trading range, which we discuss in Chapter 9. The 
original trend line then becomes the bottom channel line. Figure 10-4 shows 
an example of a channel.

154
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
 
Figure 10-4: 
A channel.
 
Channel lines
Trending and channeling strategies
The strategies for using trend lines and channels are similar. When an 
uptrending stock approaches the trend line or the bottom channel line, 
short-term traders often see an opportunity to take a position in the direction 
of the dominant trend. As long as the stock’s price does not fall through this 
support level, they will hold the position. Position traders, on the other hand, 
may use these same conditions to validate their existing positions as still 
viable. If, however, the stock closes below the trend line and remains below 
it for longer than a day or two, position traders and short-term traders must 
consider the possibility that the trend has reached its end. It’s even possible 
that the trend has reversed.
It may seem perverse, but when a upwardly trending stock breaches the top 
channel line, it’s not always good news. The stock may be overextended. At 
the very least, it’s an indication to traders to pay close attention. In Figure 
10-4, PLCM rose outside of its top channel line several times. The trend failed 
soon afterwards (but that isn’t shown in Figure 10-4).
 
Trend lines and channels work better across longer periods of time. A stock 
price that violates a long-running, persistent trend or channel line on a weekly 
chart provides more meaningful guidance than when it breeches a support 
line on a daily chart or an intraday chart. In our experience, short-term trend 
lines add little information that isn’t already present in the steady march of 
higher highs and higher lows.
When a stock breaks a short-term trend line, we believe it’s best to step back 
one time increment to evaluate the situation. For example, if you’re trading 

155
 Chapter 10: Following Trends for Fun and Profit
based primarily on daily chart data, display a weekly chart and examine the 
trend line and the series of intermittent highs and lows. If the march of higher 
highs and higher lows remains intact on the weekly chart, you may want to 
give your position a little room to work itself out. However, if a longer time 
frame shows a break in the pattern of higher highs and higher lows, you need 
to consider exiting your position right away.
 
We use trend lines for guidance while trading, but rarely do we make decisions 
solely on the basis of a trend-line penetration. Although initiating short-term 
positions in the direction of the dominant trend is possible by using channels 
to enter and exit the position, doing so is very difficult, and few traders are 
able to engage in that practice profitably. Some traders take this concept even 
one step further by trying to take positions in opposition to the dominant 
trend as the stock price approaches the upper channel line. We believe trading 
in the direction opposite that of a dominant trend and a stock’s fundamental 
picture is foolhardy and an excellent way to lose a substantial portion of your 
trading capital.
Bottom line: Trend lines and channels are additional tools that you can use to 
monitor the progress of a stock price trend. They can be used to help identify 
trading opportunities, but we recommend they not be your primary method 
of determining entry and exit points.
Seeing Gaps
A price gap forms on a bar chart when the opening price of the current bar 
is above or below the closing price of the previous bar. Gaps occur mostly 
on daily charts, sometimes on weekly charts, and rarely on intraday charts. 
Depending on the circumstances, gaps can show continuation and reversal 
patterns, and they can signal an opportunity to enter or exit a position.
Some gaps are obvious and some are subtle. For example, if the opening 
price is above the previous close, but the low of the current bar is below the 
previous high, then those bars overlap and the gap is hard to spot. Many 
traders simply ignore that type of gap. If, however, the low of the current 
bar is obviously higher than the high of the previous bar, that will draw the 
attention of most traders. Examples of obvious gaps are shown in the following 
sections.
Gaps are divided into several broad categories based on where the gap 
occurs. These categories determine your trading strategy and are discussed 
in the sections that follow.

156
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Common gap
Gaps that occur within a trading range, as described in Chapter 9, can be 
either a common gap or a breakout gap. If the gap occurs in the middle of the 
trading range, far from either the support or resistance level, it is a common 
gap. Common gaps occur frequently and are, well, rather common. They 
rarely provide meaningful trading opportunities. Ignoring them usually is the 
best policy. Figure 10-5 shows several common gaps and a breakout gap.
Breakout or breakaway gap
When a stock price exceeds a high of a price range during a specific time 
frame or falls below the low during that same period and simultaneously 
forms a gap, traders describe that situation as a breakout or breakaway gap. A 
breakout gap often provides excellent trading signals to enter a new position, 
in the direction of the gap. Figure 10-5 shows an example of a breakout gap 
from a long-standing trading range. We discuss trading strategies for trading 
range breakouts in Chapter 9.

Breakout

common 
gaps.

157
 Chapter 10: Following Trends for Fun and Profit
Continuation gap
A continuation gap is also known as a runaway gap or an acceleration gap. 
This type of gap occurs within an uptrend when the open price of the current 
bar is higher than the close price of the previous bar. If the low of the cur-
rent bar is also obviously above the high of the previous bar, this gap usually 
indicates that the trend is very strong. Continuation gaps may also occur in 
downtrends. The defining characteristics are opposite those of the uptrend.
Figure 10-6 shows several examples of continuation gaps in a downtrend. 
Some short-term traders may use a continuation gap as a signal to enter a 
position in the direction of the gap. Position traders may use this same signal 
to confirm that a current trade remains viable. You sometimes see a series of 
runaway gaps occur in close proximity to each other, and these gaps usually 
are a strong confirmation of the prevailing trend. However, continuation gaps 
also warrant caution, because they can turn into an exhaustion gap.
 
Figure 10-6: 
Continuation 
gap.
 
Continuation Gaps
Exhaustion gap
Exhaustion gaps occur at or near the ends of strong trends. Unfortunately, 
the defining characteristics for an exhaustion gap are virtually identical to 
those for a continuation gap. Exhaustion gaps are often accompanied by very 

158
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
large volume, which is one clue that the gap may not be a continuation gap. 
Otherwise, distinguishing an exhaustion gap from a continuation gap is 
sometimes impossible, until the stock price changes direction. By that time, 
it is usually obvious that something is wrong with the trade and you should 
exit your position.
In Figure 10-6, we actually assume the final gap is a continuation gap, 
because if the stock price continues its trend, it will become one. If, however, 
the stock price reverses, the gap may be classified as an exhaustion gap. 
Reversal patterns are discussed in Chapter 9. Sometimes, an exhaustion gap 
turns into an island gap.
Island gap
An island gap, or an island reversal (Figure 10-7), forms when a trend changes 
direction. The pattern is actually two gaps that isolate either a single bar or 
a short series of bars from the dominant trend and the new trend. An island 
gap usually is a good indicator that the prior trend has been extinguished 
and can be used to signal an exit from an existing position. You may also use 
an island gap to initiate a new position, but only if the direction of the new 
trend aligns with the stock’s underlying fundamental condition. Be sure to 
review the “Dealing with Failed Signals” section, later in this chapter, before 
initiating any positions based on an island gap.

Island gap.

Waving Flags and Pennants
Flag and pennant patterns represent areas of consolidation on a trend chart. 
You’ve already encountered these patterns, just not by name. In a series of 
higher highs and higher lows, these patterns form the basis for the higher 
lows. In other words, the higher lows are made of flag and pennant patterns.
A pennant pattern looks like, well, a pennant. Support and resistance lines 
converge into a point forming what looks like a small pennant shape. A flag 
pattern, on the other hand, is bounded by parallel lines. All these patterns 
almost always fly counter to the prevailing trend, but the direction in which 
they’re flying is not actually a requirement.
Figure 10-8 shows examples of flags and pennants on the chart of a trending 
stock.
 
Figure 10-8: 
Flags and 
pennants.
 
Pennant
Flag

160
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
 
The key for each of these patterns is the breakout. If the breakout from the 
formation is in the direction of the established trend, then the trend contin-
ues. If not, it’s possible that the trend is over.
Flags and pennants typically are associated with a trend, but you may also 
see these patterns within the confines of a trading range. A flag or pennant 
forming near the top of a trading range hints of an eventual breakout. The 
flag or pennant pattern shows the stock consolidating near the top of the 
trading range, and that suggests that selling pressure is diminishing and the 
stock is preparing to test the zone of resistance.
Withstanding Retracements
A retracement occurs when a trending stock revisits recent prices. You’ve 
already seen many examples. When a stock makes a higher intermediate high 
and then a higher intermediate low, that is a retracement. A trading range as 
discussed in Chapter 9 can also be considered a retracement. You may hear a 
retracement called a price consolidation or a pullback, but the concept is the 
same.
Flags and pennants are relatively simple forms of retracement patterns. More 
complex retracements can occur within the confines of a trend, and like 
their simpler counterparts, they don’t actually signal the end of the trend. 
Unfortunately, complex retracements cause confusion and consternation 
for traders when they occur. Besides being difficult to anticipate, they send 
out conflicting signals to traders trying to make sense of which trading-plan 
adjustments are needed.
Three-step and five-step retracements
In an uptrend, you sometimes see breaks in the pattern of higher highs and 
higher lows when the stock price fails to reach a new high or makes a lower 
intermittent low. You may see several occurrences of these worrisome lower 
lows and lower highs happen one right after the other followed by a resump-
tion of a strong uptrend.
You will see a couple of these benign multistep patterns frequently occur 
in the midst of a strong trend, so it is useful to watch for them. A three-step 
retracement makes at least one lower intermittent high and one lower inter-
mittent low. A five-step retracement makes two lower highs and two lower 
lows. Multistep retracements also occur when a downtrending stock makes 
higher highs and higher lows.

161
 Chapter 10: Following Trends for Fun and Profit
Figure 10-9 shows an example of a five-step retracement that ultimately 
resolves in the direction of the prevailing trend. The five steps are identified, 
along with the corresponding intermittent highs and lows.

Trust us when we tell you that situations like these are disconcerting when-
ever you’re holding a position. They’re not, however, absolute signals that 
a trend has reached its end. Knowing when a trend has ended, however, is 
nearly impossible, so you need a plan for dealing with it when it happens.
 
Where, within a trend, the multistep retracement occurs has some bearing on 
what plan you choose. If the stock price has just broken out of a long trading 
range and then falters, you may want to wait for a subsequent attempt to 
break out of the trading range, but closing the position is probably best. Look 
for trading opportunities elsewhere.
If a stock price starts what may be a three-step or a five-step retracement 
after a long period of trending, and your position is profitable, you may want 
to see how the retracement plays out. Absent any obvious sell signals, such 
as an island reversal or a downside breakout from a flag, pennant, or trading 
range formation, you can wait to see how the retracement resolves itself.
Checking out a chart that reflects a longer time frame can be helpful. For 
example, you can examine a weekly chart when the retracement occurs on 

162
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
the daily chart. If the trend shows no signs of faltering on the weekly chart, 
hold your position. If the stock recovers and heads higher, so much the 
better, but if it establishes another lower high and trades below its next 
lower low, it’s time to exit.
Finally, considering fundamental factors before making your decision makes 
good sense. If a company’s deteriorating financial situation is an underlying 
cause of the retracement, then exiting your position makes sense. You also 
need to be aware of the cycle the economy is in when making your decision. 
If the economy is approaching a turning point as your stock’s technical 
situation deteriorates, getting out of the position usually is a good idea.
Dealing with subsequent trading ranges
A trading range or a cup and handle formation, like the ones described in 
Chapter 9, also are complex consolidation patterns. A trend that’s interrupted 
by a period of range-bound trading may indicate either a pause before the 
trend resumes or the end of the trend. The only way of knowing which way 
the trend will go is to watch for the breakout. Unfortunately, you may be in 
for a long wait.
In the retracement pattern shown in Figure 10-9, you can make a valid 
argument interpreting the five-step retracement as a cup and handle 
formation. Technical analysis is an imprecise discipline, so you may 
encounter ambiguous situations like this. The results in this case were the 
same regardless of your interpretation. The stock broke out of its nine-week 
complex consolidation pattern and resumed its trend.
 
Breakouts that occur in the direction of the prevailing trend may indicate 
that the trend has further to run, but they may also be a prelude to a failed 
breakout signal. Trading-range breakouts provide the strongest signals when 
they result in a change of direction from the previous trend.
Dealing with Failed Signals
All trading signals are subject to failure. Sometimes, things just don’t work 
out as planned. However, even a failed signal provides additional information 
that you can use to revise your trading plans. In fact, sometimes the best 
trading signals are the direct result of a failed signal.
Trapping bulls and bears

163
 Chapter 10: Following Trends for Fun and Profit
Breakouts from trading ranges and cup and handle patterns sometimes fail. 
These failures happen to bullish and bearish signals, and when they fail, it is 
called a trap. The two kinds of traps are
 
✓ Bull traps, which occur after an upside breakout. The stock breaks out 
of its trading range to the upside but then reverses back into the trading 
range and ultimately breaks out to the down side.
 
✓ Bear traps, which occur after a downside breakout. This opposite scenario 
to the bull trap often is very bullish. The stock reverses course and reenters 
the trading range. If a bear trap occurs within a trading range that’s pre-
ceded by a long period of declining prices, it often represents an excellent 
buying opportunity, because it’s a sign that selling pressure has evaporated 
in the stock, which thus is likely to attempt an upside breakout.
Whenever you see a potential bear trap taking place and the stock meets all 
of your fundamental criteria, you may want to enter a long position as soon 
as the stock price reenters the trading range.
Filling the gaps
A gap that’s forming usually is interpreted as a signal that the prevailing 
trend will continue. If a stock reverses and retraces prices within the gap, we 
say that the gap has been filled. A gap that’s filled negates the trading signal 
that it generated.
 
When dealing with a breakout gap, a stock price that falls back through 
the trading range resistance zone and fills the gap is likely to be a bearish 
development. Similarly, when a continuation gap is filled, you need to consider 
it a failed signal and exit your position. The same is true for an island gap. If 
prices trade back into the area of the isolated island, the trading signal has 
failed and you need to exit your position.
Deciding whether to reverse directions
A bear trap shows an example of where taking a position based on a failed 
signal makes sense. If, however, you already have a position, and the signal 
fails, exiting your position is a wise choice, because you’re letting the market 
sort out its psychosis without risking your money.
You also need to consider economic and fundamental factors when deciding 
how to handle a failed signal. Acting on a contrary signal makes sense only if 
economic and fundamental conditions support the decision.
For example, if a bullish signal fails and becomes a bearish signal, selling 
a stock short makes sense only if it’s fundamentally weak and the stock’s 

164
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
sector is in decline. Conversely, if a bear trap occurs and generates a buy 
signal, taking a position in the stock makes sense only if its earnings are 
strong and growing, its sector is performing well, and the economy is on an 
upswing.

Oscillators

T
he personal computer ushered in a new era for technical analysts. 
Today’s Internet-connected computers offer data access and analytic 
capabilities at speeds that were impossible only a decade or two ago. That’s 
not to say that calculated indicators and oscillators weren’t used before the 
PC, but rather that these indicators were so difficult to calculate and maintain 
that few technicians performed these calculations for themselves. Even fewer 
had access to real-time analysis tools that traders now take for granted.
However, the ease of calculating, modifying, testing, and using computer-
generated trading tools is as much a curse as it is a blessing. New traders 
often shun visual pattern analysis, instead preferring computer-generated 
indicators and oscillators. Doing so is a mistake. Although the perceived 
precision of these calculations seems to add to their allure, you nevertheless 
need to be aware that computer-generated analysis tools are not necessarily 
more accurate, and neither are computers able to generate higher-quality 
trading signals than visual pattern analysis.
 
The indicators and oscillators that we describe in this chapter provide you 
with additional insight into the technical condition of a stock or the market; 
however, they can’t provide faultless trading signals. No indicator works in 
every situation, finds every opportunity, and generates only accurate trading 
signals.
As a new trader, you risk paralysis by analysis by trying to follow too many 
indicators. You have too many choices. This chapter describes how to 
create and use a tiny subset of the tools that are available in today’s charting 
packages. We recommend that you become familiar with a small set of tools 

166
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
that can help you trade profitably, rather than learning how every available 
tool works. Find out how to trade profitably using this subset of tools before 
deciding that you need to add to your toolbox.
The computer-generated tools that we use every day are described in this 
chapter. Two types of moving averages are discussed, along with the moving 
average convergence divergence indicator (MACD) and the stochastic 
oscillator. In addition, the powerful concept of relative strength is described.
These tools are but a tiny subset of the technical analysis tools that are 
available online or in software charting packages. And yet this subset is more 
than enough to get you started as a profitable trader. Become familiar with 
these tools. Play around with them using historical data to see when they 
work and when they fail, and try to understand why. That way, you can know 
when the tools can help you and when they can’t.
The Ins and Outs of Moving Averages
A moving average is a trading indicator that shows the direction and magnitude 
of a trend over a fixed period of time. Some traders call it a price overlay, 
because it’s superimposed over the price data in a bar chart. Moving 
averages visually smooth out the data on a price chart to help make trend 
identification less subjective. All moving averages follow a stock’s price trend 
but can’t predict changes. They report only what has happened.
As its name implies, a moving average shows the average of a stock’s up-and-
down price movements during a specific period of time. A stock’s daily 
closing price usually is the value being averaged, but any value on a price 
chart can be displayed as a moving average. Some traders, for example, 
prefer using the mid-point between daily high and low prices for the moving 
average calculation, but you can also use the opening, high, or low prices or 
any coincident value on a price chart, including volume.
You’ll find that moving averages are used as indicators by themselves or in 
conjunction with other indicators. They are also the building blocks for other 
indicators and oscillators such as the moving average convergence/divergence 
(MACD) invented by Gerald Appel in the 1960s. Before discussing how the 
MACD is used (see the section “Discovering MACD,” later in the chapter), we 
must explain moving averages and how they are calculated. Two of the many 
types of moving averages are described in this section.

167
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
Simple moving average
A simple moving average (SMA) is simple to calculate and simple to use. 
To calculate it, you add a number of prices together and then divide by the 
number of prices you added.
An example makes the SMA clearer. In this example, a nine-day moving 
average of Intel’s (INTC) closing price is calculated throughout May 2008 and 
then is plotted on a price chart. To start the SMA calculation, use the closing 
prices shown in Table 11-1. Add the first nine closing prices together, from 
May 1 through May 13, and divide by 9. The resulting value is placed alongside 
the ninth trading day, May 13, and each subsequent day in the month.

Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
Figure 11-1 shows a bar chart associated with the price data in Table 11-1. 
The SMA data is superimposed on the bar chart’s price data. Notice that you 
need nine prices before you can plot the first SMA point. In other words, the 
first SMA point appears on the ninth price bar, and the first eight price bars 
do not display an SMA value.
To calculate the second SMA point, add the prices from May 2 through May 
14 together, divide by 9, and place the result as the SMA data point next to 
May 14. Another way to think of calculating SMAs is that you drop the oldest 
price in the calculation and add the closing price from the next price bar. 
Continue this series by dropping the oldest price, adding the newest price, 
and dividing by 9 for the remainder of the month.
 
Figure 11-1: 
This chart 
reveals a 
nine-day

Simple Moving Average
If you’re mathematically inclined, here’s what the series looks like as an 
equation:
SMA = (P1 + P2 + P3 + . . . PN) ÷ N
Where: N is the number of periods in the SMA
PN is the price being averaged (usually the closing price)
Traders used to calculate SMAs by hand, but fortunately, computers now 
relieve traders from this rather mundane chore. The way you use a moving 
average in your trading is discussed in the next section.
Exponential moving average
Another commonly used moving average is the exponential moving average 
(EMA), which can be superimposed on a bar chart in the same manner as 
an SMA. The EMA is also used as the basis for other indicators, such as the 

169
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator, which is dis-
cussed later in this chapter.
Although the calculation for an EMA looks a bit daunting, in practice it’s 
simple. In fact, it’s easier to calculate than an SMA, and besides, your chart-
ing package will do it for you. Here are the calculations:
EMA today = (Price today × K) + (EMA yesterday × (1 – K))
Where: N = the length of the EMA
 
K = 2 ÷ (N + 1)
 
Price today = the current closing price
 
EMA yesterday = the previous EMA value
 
EMA today = the now current EMA value
The start of the calculation is handled in one of two ways. You can either 
begin by creating a simple average of the first fixed number (N) of periods 
and use that value to seed the EMA calculation, or you can use the first data 
point (typically the closing price) as the seed and then calculate the EMA 
from that point forward. You’ll see other traders handling it both ways, but 
the latter method makes more sense to us. It’s the method used in calculating 
the EMA amounts in Table 11-2, which shows a nine-day EMA calculation for 
Intel throughout May 2008. The EMA value for May 1 is seeded with that day’s 
closing price of $23.29. The actual EMA calculation begins with the May 2 
closing price. For comparison, we include the results of the earlier SMA 
calculation to illustrate the difference between an EMA and an SMA.

calculations also differ. Figure 11-2 shows the data from Table 11-2 plotted on 
a chart. The EMA data is shown as a solid dark line. For comparison, the SMA 
data is also plotted using a lighter line. (StockCharts.com, our chart vendor, 
handles both the EMA and SMA differently than we’ve shown here. They use 
historical data to calculate the first EMA data point, and they automatically 
fill in the missing data on the charts for the first N periods in the SMA 
calculation.)

 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
Comparing SMA and EMA
The SMA and EMA are used regularly by position and short-term traders 
alike. Each moving average has its strengths and weaknesses. Which one you 
choose is somewhat a matter of personal preference, but one probably is 
better suited than the other in several situations. As position traders, we use 
both. We use a relatively long-term SMA to help signal exit points, and we use 
EMAs whenever we rely on the MACD indicator (see the “Discovering MACD” 
section, later in the chapter).
Consistency
An SMA has the benefit of being consistently calculated from one charting 
package to the next. If you ask for a nine-period SMA, you can be certain 
that the result will be identical to every other nine-period SMA for the same 
stock during the same time period (as long as there are no errors in the price 
data — it’s rare, but it happens).
 
Unfortunately, EMAs are not always consistent, because of the way the EMA is 
calculated — the starting point matters. You actually need more data when 
calculating an EMA than was used in the example in Table 11-2. In theory, you 
need to use all the price data available for any individual stock. In practice, 
however, that rarely is done. Some charting software packages enable you to 
specify how much data is used when calculating an EMA, but most Internet 
charting sites do not. The result: One charting vendor may calculate EMA 
values that are significantly different than the ones provided by another.
Discovering that you’re basing your trading decisions on an inaccurate 
moving average is more than a bit disconcerting. This problem occurs 
with short-period calculations such as the nine-day EMA example in Table 
11-2, but it is especially problematic for longer-term EMA calculations. 
Unfortunately, the only thing you can do is ask your chart supplier how much 
data it uses when calculating an EMA and then verify the resulting EMA by 
hand. Otherwise, you risk making trading decisions on faulty data. Also, if 
you use more than one charting package, make sure they both use the same 
method to calculate the EMA.
Reaction time
In general, short-term traders are more likely to employ EMA, but position 
traders are more inclined to use SMA. The EMA usually is closer to the 
current closing price, which tends to make it change direction faster than the 
SMA. As a result, an EMA is likely to be quicker in signaling short-term trend 
changes.

172
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
 
The SMA probably is the better indicator for identifying long-term changes in 
a trend. Unfortunately, those signals are likely to take more time to appear 
than the ones generated by a comparable EMA. The method used to calculate 
the SMA causes it to react to price changes a bit slower, and that’s the trade-off 
for getting a signal that is potentially more reliable.
Sensitivity
An unfortunate result of the method of calculating an SMA is that every time 
you add a price, another price falls off the back end of the equation. In other 
words, each new SMA data point is affected by two prices, the most recent 
closing price and the oldest closing price in the calculation. Ideally, you want 
the most recent data having a greater influence on your indicators than the 
impact of older data. But in an SMA, the oldest price affects the newest SMA 
point with the same weight as the newest price.
EMA calculations eliminate that problem. Each data point affects the EMA 
only once. You never have to drop the oldest price as a new price is added. 
For that reason, the EMA has a much longer memory than the SMA. Every 
price ever used in calculating EMA has some small effect. As an added 
benefit, EMA calculations place additional weight on the most recent price.
To understand how this works, examine the role played by the coefficient K 
in an EMA calculation. In the earlier example showing a nine-period EMA, the 
value of K (the newest price) is 0.20, or 20 percent.
For N = 9; K = 2 / (N + 1) → K = 2 / (9 + 1) = 2 / 10 = .20 = 20 percent
This means every new price added to the calculation represents 20 percent 
of the value of the EMA, while all the previous data represents 80 percent of 
it. The implication: The oldest data always has an impact, but slowly fades 
away, and newer data has a greater influence on the EMA value and the 
placement of the EMA data point.
Notice also that as the EMA period, represented by N, grows larger, the 
value of K becomes smaller, which means that each new data point has less 
influence on the EMA as the period grows larger.
Interpreting and using moving averages
Traders use moving averages to trigger buy and sell signals. In general, when 
a moving average slopes upward, you can infer that the trend is up, and when 
the moving average slopes downward, the trend is down.

173
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
One simple mechanical strategy that some traders employ works like this:
 
✓ Buy when the moving average slopes upward and the closing price 
crosses above the moving average.
 
✓ Close the position when the price closes below the moving average.
 
✓ Sell short when the moving average slopes downward and the closing 
price crosses below the moving average.
 
✓ Close the short position when the price closes above the moving average.
 
Although simple crossover strategies like this are remarkably effective in 
some trending situations, they’re equally ineffective in others. Many variables 
must be in alignment for this approach to work. For example, the stock must 
be trending (see Chapter 10), and the period for the moving average must 
be chosen carefully for the indicator to be effective. These trend-following 
systems fail miserably when a stock is range bound (see Chapter 9).
Figure 11-3 shows an example of this simple mechanical strategy on a chart 
of the Dow Diamonds (DIA), an exchange-traded fund that mirrors the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average. The chart is shown with a 30-day SMA.
The DIA showed a double bottom (see Chapter 10) in June and July 2006. 
Using the trading rules of this simple mechanical strategy, the first buy signal 
occurred on July 24, 2006, when the stock closed above the SMA as the SMA 
turned higher. While the DIA traded below the SMA several times, it did not 
close below the SMA and generate a sell signal until February 27, 2007.

Chart of

Diamonds

As it turns out, this sell signal was triggered during a retracement (see 
Chapter 10). While it is not shown on this chart, the DIA ultimately traded 
quite a bit higher. Unfortunately, the simple mechanical system did not 
generate another buy signal until the trend was almost completely exhausted.

174
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
This points out the difficulty you face when your trading strategy is based 
on a moving-average or any trend-following system. When a stock is range 
bound or in a retracement, it’s difficult to know whether the buy and sell 
signals that the moving average crossover strategy generates are good 
entry or exit signals. Keeping an eye on these complex retracement patterns 
(which we discuss at length in Chapter 10) helps you recognize that DIA may 
have entered a period of retracement — another way of saying the stock is 
trading within a range — in March and April 2007. You can’t know for sure 
whether DIA will break out of its consolidation to the upside or the downside 
until after the breakout actually occurs.
From our perspective, waiting for the breakout causes you little, if any, harm. 
When DIA entered a retracement pattern in March 2007, the economic cycle 
appeared to be ascending and not ready to peak. Other traders, however, 
argue that you risk missed opportunities elsewhere when you’re waiting on 
position in a range-bound stock to break out. Although that argument is valid, 
and favors action on the SMA sell signal, we’re still inclined to wait for the 
breakout before deciding.
We normally want some sort of confirmation signal before entering or exiting 
any position in a stock or exchange-traded fund. For example, we might 
temper the buy signal in the simple mechanical strategy described earlier 
with a requirement that the stock price remains above its SMA for several 
days after the initial signal before entering a position. The same is true for 
the sell, or close, signal. You want the stock to close below the SMA for 
several days, or you’d like to see another coincident sell signal — perhaps 
one of the visual patterns we discuss in Chapter 10 — before exiting your 
position. We use a long-period SMA to provide one of several signals to exit 
from existing positions. For example, if the price closes below a relatively 
long-term moving average and remains below it for a couple of days, we use 
that signal to exit our position.
Support and resistance factors
In addition to their trend-following abilities, moving averages also tend to 
provide support and resistance in stock prices that are trending up or down. 
When a price is trending higher, you often see the stock trade down toward 
the moving average only to reverse course and head higher. The same is true 
in reverse for stock prices that are trending lower. You often see a down-
trending stock move up toward its moving average before heading lower. The 
moving average acts as an area of resistance.

175
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
Back in Figure 11-3, uptrending DIA approached its 30-day moving average 
in mid-August, November, December, January, and February. After each lull, 
DIA headed higher. Short-term traders use these opportunities to enter posi-
tions in the direction of the dominant trend. When moving averages show a 
stock is trending higher by sloping upward, for example, short-term traders 
buy into a position when the stock price closes near or just below the moving 
average so they can ride the trend to sell at a higher price later on. Position 
traders also can use these signals as second-chance entry points, whenever 
they miss the first breakout. This strategy is called buying on a pullback.
Deciding the moving average time frame
Perhaps the most difficult decision you have to make when creating a moving 
average is determining the length or period that best fits the situation. 
Regardless of whether you select an EMA or an SMA, shorter periods yield 
more signals, but a greater percentage of those signals are false, and longer 
moving-average periods yield fewer signals, but a greater percentage of those 
signals are true. One hitch: Signals occur later in longer-term moving aver-
ages than they do in shorter-term ones.
 
In general, the shorter your trading horizon, the shorter the moving average 
you want to select. For us, a nine-period moving average is nearly useless. It 
generates too many signals that we have no intention of following. More isn’t 
always better. We want our technical analysis tools to provide better signals, 
not more, because although getting good signals is important, avoiding bad 
signals is even more so.
To reiterate, we rarely use short-term moving averages to generate buy 
signals. Instead, we use a long-period SMA to monitor the health of a trend. 
Typically, we select either a 30-day or 50-day SMA, depending on the dura-
tion of the existing trend and prevailing economic conditions. If a trend has 
existed for a relatively long period of time, we choose the 50-day SMA as 
an exit indicator. However, if the economy appears to be nearing a peak, 
as described in Chapter 5, then we tend to tighten our exit procedures and 
shorten the SMA. See Chapter 13 for more on trading strategies and exit 
procedures.
 
Traders can fall into a trap when trying to fine-tune the moving average — or 
any indicator, for that matter — for a specific stock or situation. Logically, 
testing many different moving average periods using historical data to find the 
one that generates the most profitable trades and the fewest losing trades 
seems right, and charting software packages enable you to do just that to your 
heart’s content.

176
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
However, you’ll soon discover that what worked when using historical data 
often fails miserably when trading real money in real time. This problem is 
well known to statisticians and economists who build mathematic models to 
forecast future events. It is called curve fitting, because you are molding your 
model to fit the historical data. We talk about this problem more in Chapter 
15. For now, know that fine-tuning an indicator for a specific stock or index 
rarely has any predictive value and you must avoid it. You simply can’t trade 
using historical data. You’re better off settling on a moving average period 
that satisfies the requirements for a great many situations, rather than trying 
to fine-tune the time frame of a moving average to fit each stock.
Understanding Stochastic Oscillators
The stochastic oscillator indicates momentum and attempts to show buying 
and selling pressure. This indicator compares current closing prices with 
the recent range of high to low prices and displays the results on a chart. 
Stochastic oscillator values cycle, or oscillate, between zero and 100 percent.
Calculating stochastic oscillators
The typical stochastic oscillator is measured across a 14-day period, but a 
different time frame can be specified. Here’s the calculation:
%K = 100 × (closing price – lowest low (N)) ÷ (highest high (N) 
– lowest low (N))
% D = 3-period moving average of %K
Where: N is the number of periods used in the calculation (usually 14)
This calculation describes a fast stochastic. The names %K and %D, respec-
tively, identify the stochastic oscillator and the signal line. We typically use a 
variation of this indicator that’s called a slow stochastic. The slow stochastic 
oscillator calculation is
%K = 3-period moving average of (100 × (closing price – lowest low (N)) 
÷ (highest high (N) – lowest low (N)))
% D = 3-period moving average of %K
Where: N is the number of periods used in the calculation (usually 14)

177
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
In effect, the slow stochastic uses the %D value from the fast stochastic 
calculation as its starting point. While the fast and slow stochastics look 
similar when plotted on a chart, the slow stochastic is smoother and less 
jumpy. It generates fewer and more reliable trading signals, but the signals 
appear more slowly than with the fast stochastic. Note: You will find that 
some charting packages permit you to specify different values for the moving 
average period, and some even permit you to change from an SMA to an EMA.
Interpreting stochastic oscillators
As we mention earlier, the stochastic oscillator cycles between zero and 100 
percent. Readings of more than 80 percent imply an overbought condition. 
Readings of less than 20 percent are interpreted as an oversold condition. 
As with most indicators, an overbought condition can be resolved if a stock 
trades lower or enters a period of consolidation. Similarly, an oversold 
condition can be resolved if a stock trades higher or enters a period of 
consolidation.
Overbought and oversold conditions can persist for long periods of time; 
therefore, readings that stay above 80 percent or below 20 percent are not 
enough to generate trading signals. Instead, stochastic oscillator signals are 
generated
 
✓ When the stochastic oscillator moves from below to above 20 percent, 
triggering a buy signal
 
✓ When the stochastic oscillator moves from above to below 80 percent, 
triggering a sell signal
Figure 11-4 shows a slow stochastic oscillator on a price chart for Apple 
(APPL). Note the transitions from below to above 20 percent that occurred 
in February, April, August, and November. All three represented good entry 
opportunities for this uptrend. Also note that the stochastic buy signals 
coincided with a retracement pattern. Finally, note that few of the indicator’s 
sell signals, where the stochastic oscillator crosses below 80 percent, 
represented good selling or shorting opportunities while Apple was trending 
higher.
Some traders use a stochastic oscillator crossover strategy where buy signals 
are triggered when %K crosses above %D, and sell signals are triggered when 
%K crosses below %D. For our style of trading, that generates too many sig-
nals, a very high percentage of which are false, as you can see in Figure 11-4.

178
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis

The stochastic oscillator is most useful when it’s used in conjunction with 
other indicators. When a stock is trending, the stochastic oscillator is useful 
in finding entry points within a dominant trend. In an uptrend, for example, a 
buy signal that’s generated when the stochastic oscillator moves from below 
to above 20 percent is likely to be a good one. The stochastic oscillator 
signals many overbought conditions within an uptrend and rarely generates 
useful sell signals. It also works well in trading-range situations, and you’ll 
find short-term traders who use it to trigger buy and sell signals when a stock 
is in a trading range.
Discovering MACD
The moving average convergence divergence indicator (MACD) is a trend-
following momentum indicator. MACD is designed to generate trend-following 
trading signals based on moving average crossovers while overcoming prob-
lems associated with many other trend-following indicators. MACD also acts 
as a momentum oscillator, showing when a trend is gaining strength or losing 
momentum as it cycles above and below a center zero line. MACD is an excel-
lent indicator and an integral part of our trading toolset.
Calculating MACD
Charting packages routinely calculate MACD for you, but knowing how this 
indicator is created is important for gaining a better understanding of how 
it works. The MACD calculation isn’t complex; it’s just three exponential 
moving averages. Here are the steps:

179
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
 
1. Calculate a 12-period EMA (see the earlier section on “Exponential 
moving average”).
 
2. Calculate a 26-period EMA.
 
3. Subtract the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA to create the 
MACD line.
 
4. Use the resulting MACD line to calculate a 9-period EMA to create the 
signal line.
 
5. Plot the MACD as a solid line; plot the signal line as either a dashed or 
lighter-colored line.
An additional indicator, the MACD Histogram, is usually shown as part of the 
MACD. It uses a histogram to show the difference between the MACD line and 
the signal line. The histogram is plotted above the zero line when the MACD 
line is above the signal line, below the zero line when the signal line is above 
MACD, and at zero when they cross.
Figure 11-5 shows a weekly chart of AGCO Corp. (AG) along with an MACD 
indicator and an MACD Histogram. When using MACD, we prefer weekly 
charts. That’s how the indicator was originally designed to be used, and for 
our style of trading, a weekly MACD indicator provides more useful informa-
tion about the strength and direction of a trend and potential trend reversals. 
You will find that other traders use this indicator for both longer and shorter 
periods as well.

Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
AG experienced a long period of consolidation before starting to rally in 
early 2006. The stock continued its ascent through 2006 and 2007. Notice the 
corresponding periods on the MACD. The MACD line (the solid line) crosses 
over the zero center line during the third week in February. This was a buy 
signal for this stock. You might also notice that the MACD line crossed the 
signal line in early January 2006. This MACD crossover signal is another early 
indication suggesting a possible new uptrend. See Chapter 13 for more about 
how we use this signal.
Using MACD
 
MACD provides a remarkable amount of information in a concise format. As 
you can see in Figure 11-5, MACD oscillates above and below a center zero 
line and is a good indicator for showing the direction of the dominant trend, 
signaling
 
✓ An uptrend when the MACD line crosses above the center line
 
✓ A downtrend when the MACD line crosses below the center line
Some short-term traders use the signal line to trigger
 
✓ Buy signals when the MACD line crosses above the signal line
 
✓ Sell signals when the MACD line crosses below the signal line
We don’t, however, find that short-term technique to be very reliable because 
it generates too many false signals. Instead, we prefer using the position of 
the MACD line relative to the zero line as an indication that the stock has 
begun trending.
Figure 11-6 shows a chart of weekly prices for the S&P 500 Depository 
Receipts, sometimes called SPDR or Spyders. (The stock symbol is SPY.) SPY 
is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 index.
Notice how the SPY establishes a series of higher highs and higher lows 
during the period from June through October 2007, but the MACD line estab-
lishes a series of lower highs during this period. This creates what’s known 
as a divergent pattern. This particular example of a divergent pattern is a 
bearish divergence. In a bearish divergence, the stock establishes a series of 
higher lows and higher highs, while the MACD establishes a series of lower 
highs. A bullish divergence is the reverse, the stock establishes a series of 
lower lows and lower highs, while the MACD establishes a series of higher 
highs.

181
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
 
Divergences that occur in the same direction as the dominant trend are often 
useful for entering positions. However, a divergence that is counter to the 
dominant trend is less likely to be a reliable trading signal. For example, a 
bearish divergence in a dominant uptrend is rarely a good signal to enter a 
short position. This type of bearish divergence may, however, signal that the 
stock has entered, or is about to enter, a period of retracement.
This bearish divergence on SPY is best interpreted as a signal showing that 
the momentum of the multiyear S&P 500 bull market was slowing. In fact, 
the market peaked in October 2007 and remained in a downtrend for many 
months.
Each time the MACD line crosses above or below the signal line suggests a 
potential change in the direction of the dominant trend. While this is not an 
outright buy signal or sell signal, it does suggest a change may be in the wind. 
In the case of a bearish divergence, the best way to exploit that information 
is to monitor individual stocks and ETFs for weakness, and either close long 
positions when they deteriorate, or initiate new short positions as they 
present themselves. In Chapter 13, we provide additional ideas to help 
integrate the information generated by the MACD indicator into a useful 
trading strategy.

182
Part III: Reading the Charts: Technical Analysis 
 
Most charting packages enable you to fine-tune the MACD calculation. Many 
traders vary the 12-, 26-, and 9-week values. Although nothing is inherently 
wrong with this approach, you nevertheless risk the curve-fitting problem 
whenever you try to find parameters that give you better results for a specific 
stock. That said, Gerald Appel, the man who developed MACD, uses values dif-
ferent than the original 12, 26, and 9. He also uses different values to generate 
buy signals than he does to generate sell signals. So feel free to experiment 
and have fun after you gain some experience with the default parameters.
Revealing Relative Strength
Relative strength measures the performance of one stock against another, or 
more commonly, against the performance of an index such as the S&P 500. 
The idea is to determine how the stock is performing compared with the 
broad market.
 
Unfortunately, you may run across another indicator with a similar name 
when working with your charting software. The other indicator is called the 
relative strength index (RSI) and it is something completely different than the 
relative strength discussed here. RSI is an oscillator that is used in a similar 
way as the stochastic oscillator described earlier. To keep the two separate, 
we suggest you call the RSI by its initials and use the phrase “relative 
strength” when you mean to compare the performance of a stock against a 
broad-based index or another stock.
Calculating relative strength
Among the many ways that you calculate relative strength is simply dividing 
the stock price by the index value and plotting the result, like this:
Relative strength No. 1 = stock price ÷ index value
Another technique compares the price of the stock during a given period of 
time against the index during the same period. Our preference is comparing 
percentage changes during the same period. The calculation looks like this:
Relative strength No. 2 = percentage change in stock price ÷ percentage 
change in index value
Either of these approaches, or any other that you may invent, can be plotted 
on a stock chart. Some Internet sites provide a relative strength capability. 
See www.stockcharts.com/charts/performance for an example. 
Unfortunately, if you’re using a charting software package, you’ll probably 
have to program it into your system by using its formula-editing capabilities.

183
 Chapter 11: Calculating Indicators and Oscillators
Or, you can look it up. Investor’s Business Daily has a proprietary calculation 
for relative strength that ranks stocks based on their six-month performance. 
It is a handy tool.
Putting relative strength to work
 
The goal when examining a stock’s relative strength is not necessarily to find 
the best performing stocks in the universe of all stocks, but rather to find 
stocks that are performing better than the average stock as each stock signals 
a buy.
Relative strength is one of the final pieces to the technical analysis puzzle. 
You’ve found a trading candidate when you find a stock that:
 
✓ Exhibits fundamentals as a strong company
 
✓ Has earnings that are growing faster than average
 
✓ Functions well in a strong sector
 
✓ Operates in a growing economy
 
✓ Is approaching a technical buy signal on its bar chart
 
✓ Performs better than the average stock
These characteristics favor a long position, of course. For short position can-
didates, reverse each criterion.

Techniques: When to Hold ’em, 
When to Fold ’em
In This Chapter
▶ Building your trading characteristics
▶ Trading successfully and cutting your losses
▶ Managing your holdings
▶ Protecting your money
▶ Knowing your risks
Y
ou may find this hard to believe, but some successful traders have 
more losing trades than winning trades. How? Their profits from 
winning trades overwhelm the losses from losing trades. The key to this 
success is knowing when to hold ’em and when to fold ’em — disciplined 
money management. You must develop a discipline that keeps your losses 
under control by quickly closing losing positions. The trick is to follow the 
rules you set. Good money management minimizes your trading losses 
when they occur and helps you realize a profit when it hits you right in the 
old kisser. Recognizing winners and losers — and setting your target prices 
before ever entering a position — is crucial to your money management 
strategy. In this chapter, we give you a set of rules to follow to get you started.
Identifying Important Characteristics 
of a Successful Trader
Successful traders share a common trait. You’ll find that they all successfully 
manage their money. The critical points of successful money management 
may be difficult to implement, but they’re easy to identify. They include

188
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
 
✓ Planning your trades carefully by identifying entry and exit points
 
✓ Minimizing losses by ruthlessly adhering to your stop-loss points
 
✓ Protecting your profits with trailing stops
 
✓ Exiting your position when the trend ends
When using technical analysis to make your trades, you won’t get the 
lowest entry price or the highest exit price. That means you will always leave 
something on the table. The idea is identifying when a trend has begun, 
entering the position, and riding the trend until it ends.
Opening the Door to Successful Trading
Because your way to successful trading is disciplined money management, 
the key to opening that door to success is developing a plan for your trades 
and sticking to that plan, even if it goes against what your gut tells you. 
Sometimes you think you’ve picked what seems like the perfect stock, but 
then it just doesn’t perform the way you expected.
Before entering that trade, you need to set an entry point, the price at which 
you’ll enter a trade, and an exit point where you will exit the trade if it goes 
poorly. Don’t deviate from your plan, even if it means accepting the fact that 
you made a mistake. We discuss setting entry and exit points in the section 
“Protecting Your Principal.” For more info about entering and exiting posi-
tions, check out Chapters 10 and 11.
 
Although it may be cliché, it’s nevertheless true: You need to cut your losses 
short and let your profits run. In other words, fold (sell) when your losses first 
appear and hold as your profits continue to build.
 
Your most important money management goal is to get out of losing positions 
as quickly as possible. After taking normal up and down price fluctuations (as 
discussed in Chapters 9 and10) into consideration, you must develop a 
method of recognizing when a stock is not behaving the way you expected, 
and as a result, be prepared to close a losing position before it consumes too 
much of your trading capital. Try to keep losses below 5 or 6 percent for any 
position. Or you could think in terms of your total trading capital and try to 
keep the loss from any single position below 1 or 2 percent. Unfortunately, 
achieving a balance between recognizing your losers and dumping them in 
time (knowing when to fold ’em) is more difficult than it sounds.

189
 Chapter 12: Money Management Techniques: When to Hold ’em, When to Fold ’em
Managing Your Inventory
To be successful, you need to treat trading as a business and stocks as your 
business inventory. Just like any other business, you must carefully manage 
your inventory to succeed. Factors paramount to successful trading are:
 
✓ Viewing trading as a business. You trade to make money. Sometimes 
you pick the wrong stock and have to accept a loss. Losses are a part of 
any business. The key to good business planning is minimizing losses.
 
✓ Overcoming the most common trader’s dilemma. Many traders get 
caught up in the moment, trying to defend their position even as it 
moves in the wrong direction. When your choices no longer make good 
business sense, you must quickly make cold, hard decisions and deci-
sively act to cut losses short.
 
✓ Approaching the solution to your trading dilemma as if it’s a business 
problem to solve. Sell when you stand the chance of making a healthy 
profit or when you must accept that you’ve made a mistake and it’s time 
to move on. Select your entry and exit target points before you buy the 
first share of any stock.
Thinking of trading as a business
So, how do you start thinking of trading as a business? Conceptually, it’s 
simple. Like any other business, traders have fixed costs; variable costs; 
finite amounts of working capital, assets, and liabilities; fickle customers 
(or fickle market conditions); fickle vendors (market conditions again); and 
inventory. Managing these business factors results either in profits or losses, 
and you, of course, want to maximize the profits and minimize the losses. 
The most important step you can take in treating trading as a business is 
thinking of the contents of your portfolio as your inventory.
 
Traders need to manage their businesses with the same clear-eyed, cold-
hearted detachment as any successful business owner. But many traders, 
even the experienced, find thinking about trading as a business a difficult task. 
They make a decision, take a position, and stick with it regardless of how far 
prices go down — even when their stock flushes farther down the toilet.

Recognizing the trader’s dilemma
 
Selling is hard. For some reason it’s emotionally more difficult to close a 
position, especially a losing position, than it is to open it. Traders rationalize 
holding a losing position by saying to themselves, “I’ll give it some room to 
work out, it’s only a paper loss.” But that rationalization is foolhardy. You 
never hear traders describe a winning trade as a paper gain, and you shouldn’t 
rationalize losing positions that way, either.
Falling in love
Traders fall in love with their stocks. Understanding how falling in love with 
a stock can happen is easy. You spend many a late night finding the right 
stock. You evaluate the economy, find a strong sector, research the financial 
condition of the top companies in the sector, and check the charts.
You didn’t mean for it to happen, but you try to justify your actions as 
nothing more than a fling . . . really. You find a stock that looks promising, 
and then something clicks. You hardly notice at first, but now you’re in love. 
So you enter your trade, and . . . your stock’s price goes the wrong way. 
Which way is the wrong way depends on your position. If you own the stock 
and its price falls, obviously that’s the wrong way. But if you sell the stock 
short, the wrong way is if its price rises. We discuss the mechanics of selling 
short in Chapter 14. Either way, you’re losing money.
Breaking up is hard to do
After all the late nights, the hard work, and the brilliant analysis, you may 
end up asking yourself, “How could I have been so wrong?” You’re not alone. 
We just kept thinking: “How can everyone else be so wrong? This is a great 
stock. It has to go up. We’ll wait for everyone else to come to their senses, to 
realize the error of their ways, and then this trade will turn out just fine.”
 
The idea that the market may not love your stock, too, sometimes is hard to 
swallow. After you’ve taken a position, a psychological quirk (everyone has it) 
makes you want to be right. Somehow, you need to overcome this quirk. 
Otherwise, it can lead to many losses and possibly to financial ruin.
Finding a better plan
Approaching the trader’s dilemma as though it were a business problem for 
you to solve can be helpful. The business of women’s fashions provides an 
analogy that will do so nicely. The fashion industry works in obvious cycles. 
For example, you see long-term cycles at work as hemlines rise and fall and 
even longer cycles as you witness periodic mysteries that cause Capri pants 

191
 Chapter 12: Money Management Techniques: When to Hold ’em, When to Fold ’em
and bell-bottom trousers to appear and just as easily disappear. You also see 
shorter cycles as clothing for the current season is discounted to make way 
for the next season’s fashions. These shorter seasonal cycles illustrate the 
day-to-day issues that traders face.
Picking stock for the seasons
As spring approaches, retailers stock up on colorful, lightweight merchandise. 
You may even see swimsuits before then for those lucky souls who head to 
the tropics to escape the frosty chill. Fall clothes start showing up in stores 
as summer heats up. Before summer is over, heavier-weight clothes, including 
a selection of winter coats, begin appearing on clothing racks.
Ideally, retailers try to sell all their winter coats — and all their bathing suits 
and spring outfits — before the next season arrives, but that rarely happens. 
Retailers often have unsold inventory as the end of the season approaches.
Cleaning out the stock
You can use a couple of alternatives for handling unsold seasonal inventory, 
but neither is pleasant. The retailer can store the merchandise until next 
year, but storage costs carry charges that eat into capital. The greatest cost 
of storing merchandise is the lost opportunity. The retailer’s capital gets 
locked up in unsold merchandise and thus can’t be used to buy current-
season inventory that’s more in demand. Making matters worse is the fact 
that fashions offer no guarantee that they’ll remain fashionable, so selling 
this year’s inventory next year may be impossible.
Another alternative is marking down the price of your merchandise beginning 
relatively early in the season and continuing to do so until all the merchandise 
is sold. This approach quickly
 
✓ Frees up capital that the retailer then can use to buy newer inventory
 
✓ Stops the accrual of carrying charges
 
✓ Clears out storage and display space
 
✓ Avoids the risk that the merchandise will become worthless in the future
This solution is better, even though it sometimes means selling the merchan-
dise below cost.
Clothiers buy inventory to sell it at a profit. They know their costs, and they 
determine the profits they want to earn from the sale of each item. Retailers 
try to earn as much profit as possible, but start cutting prices whenever sales 
don’t happen quickly enough. Retailers cannot afford to fall in love with their 
winter coats. They need the space and capital for spring merchandise. They 
don’t get choked up when it’s time to sell.

192
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Keeping your inventory current
Managing your trading business as if you were a retail merchant is a good 
idea. The cycle of economic expansion, peak, recession, and trough, as 
described in Chapter 5, is somewhat akin to the four seasons. Your stocks 
are your inventory. Their prices rise and are discounted in anticipation of 
the changing economic cycles, as described in Chapter 13. And your trading 
account is your working capital. Just like the retail merchant, your goal is to 
protect your principal, your working capital, so you can stay in business.
However, you may find that some factors differ. The stock market is, of 
course, a much more efficient pricing mechanism than the retail clothing 
industry. You can’t set the price of merchandise; the market does it for you. 
You can take several approaches to keep your trading inventory current. 
Many traders use trend analysis and relative strength analysis, as described 
in Chapters 10 and 11, to try to take positions in the best performing stocks 
and sectors. Some traders also track general market conditions, quarterly 
and annual SEC filings, company announcements, and key analysts’ reports, 
as described in Chapters 5, 6, and 7.
We tend to combine both approaches in the ways we trade. We want to own 
strong stocks in strong sectors, and we want to know how well the com-
panies manage their businesses. Although any changes in these elements 
are worth a look-see, we don’t have immediate hair-trigger reactions. We 
do sometimes replace positions that begin to underperform, relative to the 
market, with emerging leaders, and yet we show a little extra patience with 
positions that are profitable but are beginning to slightly underperform. If, 
however, a stock position starts losing money, then we close the position 
without a second thought. The goal is to protect your trading capital, and 
we show you some techniques and examples to accomplish this in the next 
section.
Protecting Your Principal
In the same way that retail merchants face the possibility of holding on to 
their stock of winter coats that may fall out of style, you can avoid the risk of 
owning a stock that falls out of favor with other investors and loses its value. 
By acting quickly when you see changes in the market, you can avoid losing 
a large chunk of your trading capital (or principal). As long as you get out of 
your position quickly, your trading capital won’t be tied up in a losing stock 
position any longer, and you’ll escape the losing trade with most of your cash 
intact. More importantly, you’ll be able to trade another day.

193
 Chapter 12: Money Management Techniques: When to Hold ’em, When to Fold ’em
 
It makes sense, of course, to hold on to a stock as long as its price is appreciating. 
However, being mindful of when your stock price begins to fall is important. 
You must have a plan for dealing with losing trades or deteriorating profits. 
Time to fold up the stock and get out!
 
If your goal is to keep trading for a long time, the only way to do that is to 
not lose too much money. This might seem patently obvious, but you would 
be surprised by how few investors, and even some traders, make capital 
preservation their highest priority. To keep from making that mistake, it helps 
if you keep these important goals in mind as you trade:
 
✓ Protect your principal first.
 
✓ Don’t let a large profit turn into a small profit.
 
✓ Don’t let a small profit turn into a loss.
 
✓ Don’t let a small loss turn into a large loss.
Recovering from a large loss: It ain’t easy
 
When thinking about protecting your principal, you need to accept that taking 
a small loss is better than risking a larger one. You need to understand how 
badly (and quickly) things can go wrong, and how that can result in a loss of a 
huge chunk of your capital with little chance of recovering it. To illustrate, 
check out an example of the impact that large losses can have on your money.
Perhaps you bought XYZ stock for $10 per share. The stock falls to $9, repre-
senting a $1 loss. You’ve lost 10 percent of the original price of the stock. To 
recover from that loss, the stock price must rise from $9 to $10, but notice 
that 10 percent of $9 is only 90 cents. In other words, your stock must gain 
more than 10 percent to recover from a 10 percent loss. Here’s how to review 
the math using percentages.
To find the percentage loss, push or click on the respective percent button 
on your calculator or in a computer spreadsheet, or simply divide $1 by $10.
$10 – $9 = $1 → $1 ÷ $10 = 0.10 → 0.10 × 100 = 10%
To find the percentage gain required to recover that $1 loss — again notice 
that your stock is now a $9 stock and that 10 percent of $9 is only 90 cents, 
not $1 — divide $1 by $9.
$1 ÷ $9 = 0.1111 → 0.1111 × 100 = 11.11%
In other words, your $9 stock needs to gain a little more than 11 percent to 
get back to even.

194
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
For losses of less than 10 percent, the required gain isn’t significantly greater 
than the loss you’ve just experienced. But for larger losses, the problem 
grows unmanageably. Look at Table 12-1 to see what we mean.
Table 12-1 
Percentage Gain Required to Recover Loss

Game Over
Getting a stock to go up 5 or even 10 percent is hard enough. It seems 
irrational to hope for a stock that’s fallen by 50 percent to quickly recover 
100 percent, or for one that’s fallen by 75 percent to ever recover 300 percent.
 
Selling quickly and avoiding large losses is a much better course. Otherwise, 
you’ll be out of trading capital, and out of business, in a mighty quick hurry.
Why traders use percentages to describe results
Why do traders use percentages to describe 
their results? The use of percentages is a simple 
way of accurately comparing the results of one 
trade with the results of another — as a per-
centage, a $1 gain on a $10 stock is identical to 
a $10 gain on a $100 stock. The price per share is 
not as important as the percentage gain (or loss) 
or the total gain (or loss). Look at it like this: If 
you have $1,000 in your trading account, you can 
buy 100 shares of a $10 stock, or you can buy 
10 shares of a $100 stock. If the price of either 
stock rises by 10 percent, your account total is 
the same in either case — $1,100. A 10 percent 
rise in a $10 stock is $1. A 10 percent rise in a 
$100 stock is $10. But the total amount of money 
earned is the same in either scenario.
If you think in terms of percentage gains or 
losses, you can correctly compare the results 
of one trade with that of another. The actual 
price of a stock, and the actual number of points 
gained or lost, isn’t as important as the size of 
the move in percentage terms. Although you 
can buy many more shares of the lower priced 
stock, it’s equally difficult for either stock to 
move 10 percent. If you think about it like this, 
you will see that there is no reason to favor the 
lower priced stock, even if you can buy more 
shares, over the higher priced stock.

 Chapter 12: Money Management Techniques: When to Hold ’em, When to Fold ’em
Setting a target price for handling losses
 
The most important concept of protecting your principal is accepting the fact 
that you made a mistake and moving on. Sell that loser. Don’t let a small loss 
turn into a large one. Before entering a trade, make sure you set a target price 
that you’re willing to initially pay for a stock, and set a target price for selling 
it if the trade results in a loss.
Setting a stop-loss price (or, as traders say, “setting your stop”) is more akin 
to an art than a science. You can employ several techniques for determining 
your stop-loss price. One that others often advocate, but we don’t recom-
mend, is choosing a predetermined percentage loss as your stop-loss price. 
We think using technical analysis (see Chapters 9 and 10) to identify when a 
trade has failed is a better approach. Here’s an example.
Figure 12-1 is a daily price chart of the Gold Trust Shares (GLD) exchange-
traded fund that shows support and resistance lines, respectively, drawn on 
the chart at approximately $63.62 and $67.47 and indicates the ETF has just 
broken out of a long trading range on high-volume. Support, resistance, and 
breakouts are discussed in Chapter 9. The breakout is identified on the chart.
Figure 12-1 represents a picture-perfect setup for entering a trade. As 
discussed in Chapter 9, your entry point for this trade occurs above $67.50 
when the ETF breaks through the resistance line. But how do you handle the 
trade if it doesn’t work out? Or, perhaps a better question to ask is, how do 
you know when the trade has failed?
One of several approaches suggests that if the breakout fails (the price 
declines below the resistance level), you need to exit your position 
immediately. For the GLD example in Figure 12-1, if the ETF were to fall below 
the resistance line ($67.47) after it breaks out above it, you should exit.
Another approach suggests that if the ETF falls below the mid-point of the 
trading range, in this case somewhere around $65.50, then the breakout buy 
signal has failed. In that case, you can use any price below $65.50 as the 
stop-loss price to exit from this position.
In the first scenario, the financial risk is small. As long as you get good fill 
prices (fills) on both your entry and exit orders, your risk should be no more 
than $1.00 to $2.00 per share, which reflects a loss of only 1.5 percent to 3 
percent on the trade. We discuss fills further in Chapter 15.
In the second approach, the risk is greater. The difference between the $67.47 
breakout price and the $65.50 stop-loss price is $1.97, but the breakout gap 
means that your actual fill price will be $67.90 or more, resulting in a greater 
percentage risk on the trade. Poor fills on either entry or exit orders increase 
the amount at risk.

Midpoint
The trade-off between the two approaches is clear. The first one risks a 
smaller amount before triggering the exit trade, but is prone to whipsaws, 
which means that you may be bumped out of a potentially winning trade. 
The second risks a greater amount but is less prone to whipsaws. In general, 
shorter-term swing traders and day traders (see Chapters 16 and 17) are 
more likely to choose the first, and position traders who expect to hold a 
trade for several weeks or months are more likely to choose the second.
 
Either approach is rational, so you need to choose the one that you can live 
with. If you start second-guessing your stop-loss points, they’re no longer 
useful, so be sure to use an approach that you’ll honor. Using the first 
approach may make more sense for new position traders, so tight stops can 
serve as educational tools. You’ll risk less on each trade but you’ll be subject 
to a few whipsaws, and you’ll get into the habit of selling when you have small 
losses. And that’s a good habit to learn.
Determining good trading candidates
Whether the ETF in this example (Figure 12-1) is a good trading candidate is 
open to discussion. From a technical perspective (see Chapter 9), it has many 
of the characteristics of a good setup. The same is true for the fundamental 
point of view. The price of the Gold Trust ETF correlates closely with the rate 

197
 Chapter 12: Money Management Techniques: When to Hold ’em, When to Fold ’em
of inflation and with many commodity prices, both of which had been rising. 
It also has an inverse correlation to the value of the local currency, which in 
our case is the U.S. dollar. The dollar had been losing value for years.
However, GLD had been in an uptrend from 2001 through early 2006. The ETF 
then traded in an increasingly tighter range that lasted through the period 
shown in Figure 12-1. After a long run up in price like this, you must be cir-
cumspect about any stock or ETF, even following the long consolidation 
period in this example. While stocks can continue to rise in price for very 
long periods of time, neither stocks nor ETFs grow to infinity or beyond.
Even though the technical and fundamental conditions favored this trade, 
these late-to-the-party setups do not always work out. That’s why we like 
to keep our stops very tight in this kind of a situation. As it turned out, this 
trade was profitable. GLD rallied into the first part of 2008 and peaked over 
$100 before ultimately breaking down.
This example is applicable to any new trading position. To find good trading 
candidates, you need to decide whether the trade makes sense from financial 
and technical perspectives. Then you’ll be better able to identify a trading 
pattern that clearly shows a good entry point and identifies the price point 
when the original trading signal has failed. Only then can you place a stop-
loss order nearby to reduce your risk of losing too much of your precious 
trading capital. Only under those circumstances should you enter the trade.
Strategies for handling profitable trades
Profitable trades are somewhat easier to handle than losses, but they’re not 
without complications. You must decide whether you want to leave your 
stop-loss point where it is or try to lock in a small profit by moving it up.
You obviously want to try to keep any profit from turning into a loss. For 
example, say that you enter the GLD trade in the Figure 12-1 example, and a 
few days after entering the order it remains in positive territory with a small 
profit. For this discussion, assume that your original stop price is $65.50, the 
mid-point of the trading range. Your choice is to leave the stop where it is or 
move it above the resistance line, to $67.50. If you choose the former, and the 
stock trades below $65.50, your formerly profitable trade will be closed for 
a loss. If you choose the latter, you will be stopped out if GLD trades below 
$65.50. You must now decide whether to move your stop-loss order to pro-
tect the small profit, or leave the stop where it is to keep from jeopardizing 
the stock’s chances of gaining more.
This balancing act is delicate. You’re trying to catch a bigger trend higher 
and ride it, which argues for leaving the stop where it is for a little while 
longer. But sooner, rather than later, you’ll want to move your stop-loss 

198
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
above your entry price. This decision becomes easier as the position pro-
gresses. As your profit grows, you’ll want to continue adjusting your exit 
points upward. This is called a trailing stop, and is discussed in the section 
“Using trailing stops.”
Breaking the pattern of higher highs and higher lows
Trends are easy to see on charts. Examine Figure 12-2, and you can easily 
identify the trend that carried the price of this GLD ETF from less than $65 
per share to $100 per share in six months’ time. In this case, the ETF creates 
a series of higher highs followed by higher lows, interspersed with several 
retracements. See Chapter 10 for more on trends, higher highs and higher 
lows, and retracements.

and higher

Gaps

Moving Average
Although this pattern sometimes is difficult to define rigorously, you can 
easily identify it on a chart. Take note that the ETF’s price appears to ride the 
moving average line (see Chapter 11) as it progresses. As a trader, this kind 
of trend is the type you want, and like, to ride for as long as you can, because 
it’ll make you some money.
Figure 12-2 also provides a couple of clues that this trend came to an end in 
March 2008. Notice the price gaps (see Chapter 10) that occur in March, and 
the accompanying high trading volume. These gaps are your first hint that 
the ETF may be in trouble. Another hint is shown at the point where the line 
indicating the ETF’s price closes significantly below its moving average. A 
third hint is when the stock fails to reach a higher price after the gap occurs.

199
 Chapter 12: Money Management Techniques: When to Hold ’em, When to Fold ’em
Any one of these events may carry enough weight for you to close your 
position. Taken together, they clearly signal that the upward trend probably 
is over, and you need to exit your position.
Using trailing stops
After you’ve entered a position and it becomes profitable, you want to move 
your stop to protect your profits. This is known as a trailing stop, because 
you keep moving it higher as your profits grow. In an uptrend, a stock makes 
intermittent higher highs and intermittent higher lows (see Chapter 10). Use 
the higher lows to define your stop points. After the ETF has made a higher 
high, reset the stop to either the most recent higher low, or the one just 
before it. Using Figure 12-2, after the ETF reaches a new high in early October, 
you should reset the stop using the most recent interim closing low around 
$72.00.
Tracking market indexes
Individual stocks and entire sectors of similar stocks regularly fall in and out 
of fashion. Sometimes these changes happen in a grand way, such as when 
the financial sector fell out of favor in 2007 and 2008.
Look at the weekly chart of the S&P 500 Index in Figure 12-3. Although the 
S&P 500 index peaked in October 2007, by 2008 it had formed a lower high 
and lower low below its recent intermittent lows. The price also closed well 
below its 52-week moving average. By the time 2008 rolled around, the vast 
majority of financial stocks were in worse shape than the broad market 
index — a prime example of a dramatic shift in market conditions. If you were 
trading at the time, you could
 
✓ Sell your positions when you saw that prices, market fundamentals, and 
technical indicators were simultaneously deteriorating.
 
✓ Wait out the market, hoping things would get better.
If you held financial stocks during that time and chose the second option, 
you took a much greater loss by selling later. Unfortunately, many buy-and-
hold investors unwisely believed that the downturn was a temporary blip 
and that financial investments would remain viable. In fact, a number of 
companies never recovered and some no longer are trading.
The right choice then, as usual, was to close your positions. By following 
these simple strategies, you’d have had more than enough information to 
know that things were not going according to plan. Although you wouldn’t 
have sold your stocks at the highest prices, neither would you have ridden 
them to their ultimate lows. By selling, you protect your profits and your 
trading capital, so you can trade another day.

Knowing when a trend is complete is just as difficult as knowing when it 
began. You can’t trade with perfect knowledge, and you can’t predict the 
future — neither can we. But you can use these tools to identify when a trend 
is likely to begin, and when it’s likely to end. And if you use excellent money 
management, you’re likely to trade profitably.
Understanding Your Risks
You need to look at the risks that traders face. The three general categories 
are market risks, investment risks, and trading risks.
Market risks
Market risks are pretty much out of your control. Of course you understand 
the risk that the markets are bound to rise and fall, but understanding the 
risks you face when they do helps you manage your money better. Three key 
risks that you can manage as a trader are
 
✓ Inflation risk: Although inflation is a risk that traders rarely consider, it 
nevertheless impacts people who are afraid to take risks. You definitely 
can’t be a trader if you’re afraid of taking risks. Basically, the risk that 
this factor poses is that your money won’t grow fast enough to exceed 
the increases in costs that inflation causes. As you know, the basics — 
housing, clothing, medical expenses, and food — increase in price each 
year. By investing in monetary vehicles that don’t keep pace with infla-
tion, you actually end up losing money.

201
 Chapter 12: Money Management Techniques: When to Hold ’em, When to Fold ’em
 
✓ Marketability risk: This factor relates to how liquid your investment is. 
If you’re restricted from selling your investment when you want to do 
so, your target selling point won’t mean much. For most stock traders, 
this factor isn’t an issue, but if, for example, you choose to invest in a 
small company whose stock isn’t traded on one of the major stock 
markets, you risk not being able to close your stock position when the 
time is right.
 
✓ Currency translation risk: Currency translation refers to disparities in 
trading stocks of companies in foreign countries. It’s only a factor when 
you trade foreign stocks, because you then must be concerned with 
fluctuations between the values of your local currency and the currency 
in the country where the company is located. Even if the stock increases 
in price, you can still lose money based on the currency exchange 
rate. If the value of your currency falls against the other currency, your 
investment can be worth less when you convert it back.
Investment risks
Investment risks relate directly to how you invest your money and manage 
your entry and exit trades. Two critical risks you must manage are
 
✓ Opportunity risk: This kind of risk involves balancing your trade-offs. 
When you trade, you establish a position that ties up money that 
otherwise can be used elsewhere. After you choose a stock and buy it, 
you lose the opportunity to buy something else that may strike your 
fancy, until you trade out of the first position. Essentially, you can miss 
other opportunities while your money’s tied up in another position.
 
✓ Concentration risk: This kind of risk happens when you put too many 
eggs in one basket. You may think you’ve found that hot stock that’s 
going to make you a millionaire, so you decide to invest a huge portion of 
your principal into that stock. By concentrating so much of your money 
on one investment, you also concentrate the risks associated with that 
investment and with the possibility of losing it all.
Trading risks
Risks that are unique to trading increase simultaneously with increases in 
trading volume. Day traders and swing traders often see a greater impact 
caused by these risks than do position traders, but everyone needs to be 
aware of these issues. See Chapters 16 and 17 for more information about 
swing trading and day trading, respectively. Risks associated with trading are

202
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
 
✓ Slippage risk: Hidden costs associated with every transaction are the 
focus of this risk factor. Every time you enter or exit a position, your 
account balance dwindles by a small amount. Every time you execute a 
trade, you subject yourself to the problem of buying at the ask price but 
selling at the bid price. The ask price is the lowest price available for the 
stock that you want. The bid price is the highest price someone is will-
ing to pay for shares you own. Unfortunately, the bid price is always less 
than the ask price. Although you can mitigate bid/ask problems by using 
limit orders, doing so subjects you to the risk that your order won’t get 
filled. The amounts for each trade may at first seem small, but as your 
trading volume increases, so do the amounts you lose to slippage.
 
✓ Poor execution risk: This problem occurs whenever your broker has 
a difficult time filling your order, which can result from any number of 
factors, including fast market conditions, poor availability of stock, or 
the absence of other buyers and sellers. The result is always the same: 
The price you expect is somewhat different than the price you actually 
receive. Although you can mitigate this problem to a degree by using 
limit orders, you still risk having the stock trade through your limit price 
and not getting your order filled at all.
 
✓ Gap risk: This kind of risk comes into play whenever a break in trading 
occurs. Sometimes a stock opens at a price significantly higher or lower 
than its previous close, and sometimes a stock trades right through your 
exit price. For example, a stock may close at $25 a share today and open 
tomorrow morning at $20. If your planned exit price is $24, and you have 
a stop order in place, your order is likely to be filled at the opening price 
or worse. Price gaps created in this way occur most often at the open. 
And although relatively rare, a gap also can occur during the trading day 
whenever surprising news is reported or trading halts.

K
nowing the current state of the economy can help you improve your 
trading results. However, knowing the current state of the market is 
crucial, because you obviously want to buy stocks in a bull market and sell 
them, or short them, in a bear market. Besides the obvious, you also want 
a strategy for trading stocks during market transitions and consolidation 
phases.
As a result, you need a method for identifying and categorizing the differing 
phases of bull and bear markets. We recommend using the six phases in 
the list that follows. Doing so enables you to adjust your trading strategies 
for each phase of the market, regardless of whether you’re trading stocks, 
bonds, indexes, futures, or options. The six phases of the market are
 
✓ Bullish transition: The market is transitioning from a bear market to a 
bull market.
 
✓ Bull market: A persistent rising trend in the market.
 
✓ Bullish pullback: A bull market in the midst of a pullback.
 
✓ Bearish transition: The market is transitioning from a bull market to a 
bear market.
 
✓ Bear market: A persistent downtrend.
 
✓ Bearish pullback: A bear market in the midst of a consolidation.

204
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
This chapter shows you how to identify these phases of the market using the 
techniques of fundamental and technical analyses that we describe through-
out this book. Although no single detail or event can enable you to out-and-
out declare a bull market or bear market, we address many small details that, 
when taken together, enable you to make informed conclusions. Likewise, 
distinguishing a transition phase from a pullback phase can be difficult. This 
chapter helps you methodically analyze the economy, the market, leading 
and lagging sectors, and individual stocks, so you can identify the particular 
phase a market is in. Furthermore, this chapter describes unified trading 
strategies that are built around these market phases.
Seeing the Big Picture
Identifying the current economic climate is the first step toward identifying 
the current phase of the markets. Only a tiny fraction of available economic 
data is required to develop a snapshot of the economy from which you can 
infer the current state of the markets. The conditions that you need to know 
(and questions you need to ask) to be able to evaluate and determine the 
cycle that the economy currently is in are
 
✓ Where interest rates are headed. Are they rising, falling, or staying the 
same?
 
✓ What officials of the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) are doing now. 
What is the Fed likely to do in the future?
 
✓ How business is performing, in general. Is industrial production rising or 
falling?
 
✓ Which sectors are leading and which are lagging. Are economically sen-
sitive stocks appreciating or declining in value, or are traders currently 
favoring defensive stocks?
This information is crucial for determining the cycle in which the economy 
currently is functioning. (For more about economic cycles, see Chapter 5.) 
Fortunately, the economic picture doesn’t change quickly, so taking the tem-
perature of the economy, if you will, can be a weekly or monthly exercise. 
Ultimately, maintaining a background knowledge of the cycles through which 
the economy is passing helps you identify current phases of the markets, 
which, in turn, can help you make better trading decisions.

205
 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
Knowing when the Fed is your friend
Current interest rates and interest-rate trends help determine the current 
position of the economy within the business cycle. Low interest rates are 
associated with economic troughs and high rates with economic peaks. In a 
nutshell, the Fed lowers rates to stimulate economic activity and raises rates 
to slow it. But the time lag between the Fed’s activity and any reaction by the 
economy often is a long one, making the Fed’s monetary policy an imprecise 
indicator. Nevertheless, you can use interest rates to get a rough idea about 
the current economic landscape.
 
Interest rate reductions that the Fed okays generally are good news for the 
stock market. The opposite also is true. When the Fed tightens its monetary 
policy by raising interest rates, stocks normally react poorly. Either way, stock 
markets may not react immediately, and unfortunately, many months can pass 
before either the stock market or the economy responds in either direction to 
the Fed’s action. Although the old stock market saying, “three steps and a 
stumble,” doesn’t always hold true, markets do often head lower after the Fed 
raises rates for the third time.
In short, falling interest rates typically lead to a rising economy and to a 
market that’s changing from a bear market to a bull market — in other words, 
a bullish transition. Ultimately, a bullish transition leads to a new bull market. 
Conversely, however, rising interest rates sooner or later lead to a market 
that’s changing from a bull market to a bear market — a bearish transition, 
and ultimately a bear market. The problem: No consistent timetable exists 
that enables you to anticipate when these changes will occur, so you should 
use interest rate changes only as a hint that a transition may be coming and 
wait for an additional confirmation before you act on a trading strategy.
Keeping an eye on industrial production
In addition to interest rates, industrial production is another indicator that 
provides insight into the health of the economy. You can monitor indus-
trial production by keeping track of the Federal Reserve’s monthly report, 
“Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization,” at www.federalreserve.
gov/releases/G17/Current/default.htm. Release dates can be found 
at www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/default.htm. New eco-
nomic growth is suggested when industrial production statistics start inching 
higher, a sign that usually indicates the market either is entering a bullish 
transition or will soon do so. Similarly, robust growth numbers often accom-
pany a bull market phase. Conversely, leveling off or falling industrial produc-
tion data shows that a bearish transition can be expected. And finally, a bear 
market phase often accompanies falling production data.

206
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Watching sector rotation
 
Monitoring leading and lagging economic sectors (see Chapter 5) provides 
direct insight into the current state of the stock market, because some indus-
tries tend to perform well at the beginning of an economic expansion and 
others tend to perform relatively well as the economy cools. Traders often try 
to anticipate changes in the economy by watching specific sectors that they 
know have tendencies to rise or fall in specific patterns that coincide with one 
economic or market cycle. These patterned tendencies are called sector rota-
tion. Although you won’t see picture-perfect sector rotation with every cycle, 
you will see enough similarities from cycle to cycle to enable you to gain addi-
tional insight into the current phase of the economy and the stock market.
Sectors that perform well during specific economic cycles and market phases 
are described in the following sections.
Anticipating a new bull market
Economic conditions that foster a new bull market include low interest rates 
and hints that industrial production is beginning to rise. Traders who moni-
tor these economic conditions often respond to them by buying the stocks of 
cyclical and technology-based companies. Bullish transition phases usually 
begin in this manner.
 
The stocks of companies whose business is sensitive to the economic cycle 
have traditionally been called cyclical stocks. Within the past few decades, 
technology-based companies have joined these so-called cyclical companies 
as bell-weather economic indicators. The stocks of cyclical and technology-
based companies, and the companies themselves, perform best when interest 
rates are low. Increased sales of their products drive industrial production 
numbers higher. These companies usually lead the market and often rally 
before an economic trough, or recession, completely bottoms out. 
Unfortunately, traders jump the gun as often as they get it right, so whenever 
you see cyclical and tech stocks begin to rally, it pays to be skeptical. Rather 
than jump to the conclusion that a sector rally means a bull market is just 
around the corner, you need to instead consider that it potentially indicates 
only a bullish transition.
Industries known for making up cyclical sectors include
 
✓ Automobile and automotive component manufacturers
 
✓ Consumer durable manufacturers that produce products such as 
appliances and consumer electronics
 
✓ Retailers, such as department stores, big-box discounters, and 
specialty retailers (excluding food, beverage, pharmaceutical, and other 
nondurable retailers)

207
 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
 
✓ Media companies, such as movie studios, radio and television companies, 
and book publishers
 
✓ Hotels, restaurants, and entertainment and other leisure companies
Technology-sector industries include
 
✓ Semiconductor (computer chip) manufacturers and manufacturers of 
equipment to produce semiconductors
 
✓ Computer and computer peripheral device manufacturers
 
✓ Software and service companies
 
✓ Telecommunication and Internet service companies
 
✓ Information technology service companies
Watching the economy rebound
Strength in the industrial sectors is a condition that usually indicates the 
markets may be entering a bull market phase. As the economy begins showing 
signs of growth, you often see a rally in industrial sectors. Large industrial 
companies often need to borrow money to increase production, a factor that 
makes them sensitive to interest rate changes. These companies tend to per-
form best in a low interest rate environment. Rising industrial production that 
drives industrial-sector earnings and stock prices higher is no coincidence.
Companies in the industrial sectors include
 
✓ Building products manufacturers
 
✓ Construction and engineering firms
 
✓ Aerospace and defense companies
 
✓ Electrical equipment manufacturers
 
✓ Airlines and air freight, transportation, and infrastructure companies
 
✓ Major manufacturing conglomerates (which are widely diversified 
companies such as GE, United Technologies, and Tyco)
Approaching a market top
When the economy is firing on all cylinders, industrial production is robust, 
and interest rates are beginning to rise. However, the stock market is trying 
to anticipate what happens next and it’s probably nearing its peak. Basic 
material stocks, energy stocks, and consumer staple company stocks tend 
to do well under these conditions. When you begin seeing strength in the 
consumer staples sector, you need to begin searching for confirmation of a 
bearish transitional phase.

208
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Companies in the basic industry and materials sectors include
 
✓ Metals and mining companies
 
✓ Chemical companies
 
✓ Construction material companies
 
✓ Forest-product companies, including paper, packaging, and container 
companies
The energy sectors include
 
✓ Oil and natural gas exploration and drilling services
 
✓ Coal and coal processing
 
✓ Refineries
Companies in the consumer staple sectors include
 
✓ Food and beverage companies
 
✓ Household product companies and other consumer staples companies, 
such as personal-care product companies
 
✓ Tobacco companies
 
✓ Retailers, specifically food, beverage, drug, and other nondurable goods 
retailers
Weathering a bear market
Healthcare and other service-sector stocks often perform better than the 
average stock as the economy peaks and as bullish market tendencies fade 
to bearish outlooks. The stocks of utility and financial companies also tend 
to perform better than average during bear markets, because they’re consid-
ered safe havens from the accompanying tide of rising interest rates and flat-
tening industrial production. As these stocks begin showing higher relative 
strength, you need to move your indicator from bearish transition to a bear 
market phase.
Consumer service sectors include
 
✓ Healthcare equipment and supplies companies
 
✓ Healthcare providers
 
✓ Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies

209
 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
The utility sector includes
 
✓ Electric power generation and distribution companies
 
✓ Natural gas distribution companies
 
✓ Water utilities companies
Companies in the financial sectors include
 
✓ Diversified financial service companies, including banks and brokerage 
firms
 
✓ Commercial banks
 
✓ Insurance companies
 
Taking a relatively long point of view as you monitor the markets for sector 
rotation is a good idea. By that we mean you’re not interested in the day-by-
day ups and downs, but rather, you’re trying to evaluate sector performance 
during periods of many weeks and even months. Remembering that bull mar-
kets tend to lift prices for all stocks is also important. So when you monitor 
sector performance, you try to find the sectors that are performing better 
than others. In bear markets, stocks that hold their values, for example, will 
outperform all stocks that have falling prices.
Finding the dominant trend
You need to own stocks during bull markets, and sell them, or short them 
(see Chapter 14), during bear markets. In other words, you want to trade with 
the dominant trend. The stock market tends to lead the economy, so using the 
market’s performance as your primary reference to find the dominant trend 
makes sense. Combining your analysis of the dominant market trend with the 
background knowledge you gained from analyzing interest rates, industrial 
production data, and sector rotation helps you refine the way you categorize 
the current phase of the market. That kind of refinement means your trad-
ing performance will improve when you can make trades with the dominant 
trend or market phase on your side.
Looking at weekly index charts
You need only a handful of tools to determine the dominant trend or phase of 
the market. We use two, the weekly charts of broad market indexes and the 
bullish percent index, which is discussed in the next section. Significant changes 
in the markets happen slowly, and thus show up better in weekly charts than 
they do in daily charts, because insignificant changes are filtered out.

210
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
We typically monitor charts of the major indexes such as the S&P 500 (SPX) 
or the NASDAQ Composite Index (COMPX). Doing so makes visually identifying 
bull markets and bear markets easy. They appear as trends, exactly like the 
ones shown on the stock charts in Chapter 10. A bull market appears as a 
series of higher highs and higher lows on weekly index charts. A bear market 
appears as a series of lower highs and lower lows. These are the dominant 
trends.
Pullback patterns, such as the flag, pennant, and other retracement patterns 
discussed in Chapter 10, correspond to the bullish pullback and bearish 
pullback conditions. And bullish transition and bearish transition phases 
may signal a trend reversal, in much the same way that reversal patterns and 
trading ranges often lead to a change in direction.
Figure 13-1 shows the phases of a bull market using a weekly chart of the 
NASDAQ Composite Index. Figure 13-2 shows the phases of a bear market 
using an earlier weekly chart of the NASDAQ Composite Index.

Trend identification tools that we discuss in Chapters 9, 10, and 11 all apply 
to these weekly charts. For example, you can easily spot the higher highs and 
higher lows in Figure 13-1 that occurred in late 2006. These higher highs and 
higher lows correspond to a bull market. You also can easily see the lower 
highs and lower lows in Figure 13-2; they accompanied the long-running bear 
market.

211
 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
You also need to be able to identify the Moving Average Convergence 
Divergence (MACD) crossover points and divergent patterns on these charts. 
We describe MACD in detail in Chapter 11. MACD signals provide you with 
additional information to augment the way you categorize current phases of 
the market.
Using MACD to indicate bull and bear markets is straightforward.

✓ A bull market is indicated when the MACD line is greater than the zero 
line and greater than the trigger line.
 
✓ A bear market is indicated when the MACD line is less than the zero line 
and less than the trigger line.
However, pullback and transition phases are not as clearly defined:
 
✓ Either a bullish transition — or a bearish pullback — is indicated when 
the MACD line is less than the zero line and it crosses above the trigger 
line.
 
✓ Either a bearish transition — or a bullish pullback — is indicated when 
the MACD is greater than the zero line and it crosses below the trigger 
line.

212
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Use the bullish percent index (BPI), described in the next section, in 
conjunction with pattern analysis, as described in Chapter 10, to help 
distinguish between the transition and pullback phases.
Using Figure 13-2, you can see where the MACD indicator on the weekly chart 
is less than zero and crosses above its trigger line. When the MACD crossed 
above its trigger line, it suggested the market may have been trying to turn 
from a bear market to a bull market in a bullish transition phase. You can 
see two instances in Figure 13-2 where the MACD signaled these bearish 
pullbacks or bullish transitions in 2008. Both failed, resulting in a dramatic 
continuation of the bear market.
Using the bullish percent index
You can use the bullish percent index (BPI) to fine-tune and confirm trading 
signals you see on the weekly index charts. The BPI is a powerful indicator 
that shows the percentage of stocks that have generated buy signals compared 
with the total number of stocks in a given index. This indicator originally was 
used to track all the stocks on the NYSE, but it also can be applied to any 
broad market index, including the S&P 500, the NASDAQ Composite, or even 
the more narrowly defined NASDAQ 100 and sector indexes. BPI provides 
fewer and better signals when evaluating larger groups of stocks.
The BPI is based on point-and-figure charts — probably the oldest and simplest 
stock charting technique — and helps you evaluate the strength of the 
market as a whole. Calculating the BPI is a bit daunting, but fortunately, it’s 
published online. For example, you can find BPIs at Stockcharts.com, where 
the current states of this indicator for the major indexes and several sector 
indexes are displayed and interpreted. See http://stockcharts.com/
symsearch/index.html?$BP for details.
As an indicator, BPI works a bit like an oscillator (see Chapter 11). It displays 
values ranging from 0 to 100 percent to identify oversold and overbought 
market conditions. For example, when fewer than 30 percent of all stocks 
are on a buy signal, the BPI shows that the market is oversold and ripe for 
turnaround. When more than 70 percent of all stocks signal a buy, the BPI 
shows the market is overbought and ripe for a downturn.
However, like individual stocks, broad market indexes can remain over-
bought or oversold for extended periods of time, so by themselves, BPI 
readings below 30 percent or above 70 percent don’t necessarily represent 
respective buy or sell signals. BPI can and does provide readings well above 
70 percent and well below 30 percent for extended periods of time.
 
Changes in BPI levels are triggered by reversal patterns. A 6 percent change in 
the stocks of a given index is required to trigger any changes (up or down) in 
the BPI. These reversal patterns are interpreted to describe the state of the 
market using six unique conditions that roughly correspond with the six 
phases of the market described in the introduction to this chapter. Here are 
the six states of the BPI:

213
 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
 
✓ Bull alert: Corresponds with the bullish transition phase. It’s triggered 
when the BPI is less than 30 percent and reverses direction when 6 
percent (or more) of all stocks change to buy signals.
 
✓ Bull confirmed: Corresponds with the bull market phase. When the BPI 
indicator forms a higher high, a bull market is confirmed.
 
✓ Bull correction: Corresponds with the bullish pullback phase. This 
condition occurs only after the BPI confirms a bull market and a minimum 
of 6 percent of all stocks change from buy to sell signals. If the BPI is greater 
than 70 percent, this change may lead to a bear alert (that’s up next).
 
✓ Bear alert: Corresponds with the bearish transition phase. It’s triggered 
when the BPI is greater than 70 percent and reverses direction after 6 
percent of all stocks change to sell signals.
 
✓ Bear confirmed: Corresponds with the bear market phase. When the BPI 
indicator forms a lower low, a bear market is confirmed.
 
✓ Bear correction: Corresponds with the bearish pullback phase. This 
condition occurs only after the BPI confirms a bear market and at least 
6 percent of all stocks change from sell to buy signals. If BPI is less than 
30 percent, this change may lead to a bull alert.
 
Although BPI is not a leading indicator, it gives you a good feel for the overall 
health of the market. When used with broad-based indexes, the BPI doesn’t 
speak often. After all, over 1,800 stocks are traded on the NYSE. For the BPI to 
register a reversal, at least 6 percent (or approximately 112) of those stocks 
must change from a buy signal to a sell signal (or vice versa). Actually, the 
distinction’s a bit more subtle than that. A total of 112 more stocks must 
change to sell signals than are changing to buy signals for the index to change 
from bull confirmed to bull correction conditions.
The BPI for smaller stock indexes generates considerably more signals. A 6 
percent change on the NASDAQ 100 requires only a balance of six stocks to 
change from buy to sell signals. Although the BPI provides information about 
the condition of these smaller indexes, you must use the signals with care. 
We believe this indicator is best used with broader-based indexes such as the 
NASDAQ Composite, the NYSE, or the S&P 500.
Selecting Your Trading Stock
After you’ve identified the dominant trend, the leading and lagging sectors, 
and the current state of the business climate, it’s time to select stocks to 
trade. Beyond general market conditions, two factors drive a stock’s price 
higher or lower:
 
✓ The fundamental condition of a company’s business
 
✓ The technical condition of a company’s stock

214
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
We cover these topics in great detail in Parts II and III of this book, so in this 
section, we highlight only a few important factors for you to consider when 
selecting your trading stock. On the fundamental side, earnings matter more 
than any other fundamental data. Traders pay particular attention to the rate 
of earnings growth as characterized by the earnings per share (EPS) growth 
rate. In general, the bigger the EPS growth rate, the better the stock price, 
and vice versa. Stocks without earnings often make very dangerous trading 
candidates for long-side trades. Although some special situations may merit 
your consideration, stocks without earnings carry a special risk. Any hint of 
unfavorable press sends the stock’s price reeling. Besides, the downside risk 
is simply too great for our taste.
Exchange-traded funds
Up to this point in the chapter, we’ve mostly 
talked about trading individual stocks, but at 
times, you may want to consider trading a 
basket of stocks. For example, say your indi-
cators all suggest a new bullish transition or 
bull market phase, but few, if any, stocks are 
showing reliable trading patterns. You want to 
enter the market with a small position to take 
advantage of these relatively early signals, but 
you can’t quite identify a good trading stock.
If that’s the case, you may want to try an 
exchange-traded index fund, known as an 
exchange-traded fund (ETF). An ETF is similar to 
an index mutual fund but is traded on the stock 
exchanges, just like shares of stock. However, 
an ETF differs from a traditional mutual fund 
in several important ways. For example, an 
ETF order is filled at the price when the trade 
is executed, not at the end of the trading day 
like most mutual funds. Also, you can place 
your ETF order just like any other stock order. 
You may use market orders, limit orders, stop 
orders, and stop-limit orders. And, unlike a 
traditional mutual fund, you may short shares 
of an ETF. See Chapter 14 for the mechanics of 
selling short.
ETFs are available for indexes such as the 
NASDAQ 100 (stock symbol QQQQ), the S&P 500 
(stock symbol SPY), the Dow Jones Industrial 
Index (stock symbol DIA), and even many nar-
rowly focused stock sectors. Many brands of 
ETFs are on the market, and they go by names 
such as Select Sector SPDR (pronounced 
“spider”), PowerShares, iShares, and so on. 
You need to stick with ETFs that trade in high 
volume. See www.sectorspdr.com or 
www.morningstar.com/Cover/ETF.
html for additional information on ETF trading 
volumes and on which stocks are included in 
each ETF.
After you identify a new bullish transition, for 
example, you may want to consider the NASDAQ 
100 or the S&P 500, or perhaps other ETFs for 
cyclical and tech stocks. Doing so enables you 
to take a position in the market while continuing 
to search for stocks that meet your fundamental 
and technical criteria.

215
 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
You also need to consider the company’s size when selecting a trading 
candidate. Although small companies can and sometimes do return outsized 
trading profits, they also present problems for traders. Stocks of small 
companies usually are lightly traded, which makes them difficult to buy and 
even more difficult to sell. You can afford to be patient when entering a trade 
but not when exiting a position, especially when the stock hits your stop-loss 
price. Lightly traded shares make exiting a position difficult, because the 
price is likely to fall quickly and dramatically when many traders are trying 
to exit simultaneously. You’re bound to lose more of your precious trading 
capital (when selling) or spend more of it (when buying) than you intended.
On the technical side, you want to trade the strongest stocks in the strongest 
sectors. You want to enter positions in these high relative strength stocks as 
they break out of trading ranges or reversal patterns. And you want to hold 
them as long as they remain relatively strong compared with other stocks.
Trading Strategies
Categorizing the phases of the market enables you to adjust your trading 
strategies based on current market conditions. The idea: Trade aggressively 
when you’re confident in your market assessment, but protect your capital 
when you’re uncertain. In this section, we present strategies for dealing with 
various market phases.
Trading the bullish transition
When you first decide the market may be entering a bullish transition phase, 
you need to use extreme caution when trading, because at this phase of the 
market, your primary goal is preserving your capital. Your secondary goal is 
getting in on the bull market, if it materializes.
 
You may take new positions during a bullish transition, but the situation is not 
urgent, so you can be selective. You need to take small, partial positions 
rather than full positions (an example is shown in the upcoming section “A 
hypothetical trading example”) by
 
✓ Identifying the strongest stocks in the strongest sectors
 
✓ Looking for trading-range breakouts and other reversal signals

216
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Keep your stops very tight and honor them rigorously. Consider an ETF if 
you have difficulty finding individual stocks that meet your fundamental and 
technical criteria.
Trading in a bull market
In a bull market, your primary goal is to become fully invested. Your secondary 
goal is capital preservation. Emphasize establishing long positions in your 
trading. You shouldn’t take on new short positions. Buy breakouts and take 
full positions, because your goal is to be 100 percent, or fully, invested. If you 
have a margin account for leverage, now is the time to use it. (The mechanics 
of using a margin when trading are discussed in Chapter 14.) You may loosen 
your stops a bit, because doing so allows for more ebb and flow of higher 
highs and higher lows.
 
The most reliable bull market signals occur during the early part of a bull 
market — after a bullish transition rather than following a bullish pullback. 
You may want to adjust your strategy to be a bit less aggressive following 
later-stage bull market signals. For example, you may want to tighten your 
stops a bit, especially when you’re using margin for leverage.
Trading the bullish pullback
A bullish pullback is a consolidation phase within a bull market in which your 
trading strategy needs to continue looking for high-quality stocks that are 
breaking out of new or subsequent trading range bases. When you decide 
the market has entered a bullish pullback phase, you may want to tighten 
your stops and seriously consider hedging your positions by using options, 
especially when you’re using margin for leverage. Hedging is like buying 
insurance. In this case, put options can be purchased to protect most of your 
trading capital in case the market moves dramatically against you. The cost 
of hedging depends on the amount of protection you buy. Options are dis-
cussed in Chapter 18.
A bullish pullback is still a bull market, so you can continue taking full posi-
tions on breakouts, but you need to be selective. Make sure that your new 
and existing positions are the best-performing stocks in the best-performing 
sectors. You need to become a bit more cautious when the particular bullish 
pullback isn’t the first to occur during the current bull market.

217
 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
Trading the bearish transition
A bearish transition indicates the market may be transitioning from a bull 
market to a bear market. You react to a bearish transition by
 
✓ Tightening stops on all your open positions
 
✓ Monitoring your positions closely
 
✓ Honoring your stops rigorously
 
✓ Exiting any long position at the first sign of trouble
You also need to consider hedging long positions by using options, as 
discussed in Chapter 18. If you’re using margin for leverage, exiting failing 
positions quickly is even more important.
If you are so inclined, you can begin looking for short sale candidates, but 
only nibble at these trades. If you plan to short, take small positions and keep 
your stops very tight. We discuss the mechanics of selling short in Chapter 14.
Trading in a bear market
 
When you’re certain a bear market has begun, don’t enter new long positions. 
Your open positions are likely to hit their stops and be closed, but for the 
ones that remain, tighten your stops and exit any existing long positions at the 
first sign of trouble. Hedge any remaining long positions with put options.
If you’re inclined to short stocks, a confirmed bear market is the time to do it. 
The mechanics of shorting stocks are discussed in Chapter 14. You may want 
to take full-sized short positions and become fully invested on the short side. 
(See the upcoming section “A hypothetical trading example,” for an example 
of position sizing.) Note: A margin account is required for selling short. We 
rarely use margin for leverage when trading short, but if you’re going to do it, 
now is the time.
Trading the bearish pullback
A bearish pullback is a consolidation phase within a market that nevertheless 
remains a bear market. As such, a bearish pullback is not a good opportunity 
for taking new long positions. You need to tighten stops on existing short 
positions, and consider hedging these positions using call options, especially 
when you’re using margin for leverage. A bearish pullback is an opportunity 

218
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
to take short-side profits and enter additional short positions when you see 
new or subsequent downside breakout patterns (see Chapter 9). Confirm 
that new and existing short positions are the worst-performing stocks in the 
worst-performing sectors.
A hypothetical trading example
Here’s a hypothetical scenario. The market is trying to begin a new bull 
market by entering a bullish transition phase. At this time, your $100,000 
example portfolio is 100 percent in cash. Your goal: Establish ten positions by 
the height of the bull market, which means that you plan to allocate $10,000 
of your initial capital for each position.
When you begin seeing signs of a bullish transition, you’re likely to be champ-
ing at the bit to start taking positions, but you haven’t found stocks that fit 
your trading criteria. Still, you’d like to participate in the new bull market, 
and you’re willing to risk a small loss if the bull market doesn’t appear.
In this case, you may want to start by taking a small position, perhaps a 
half-sized $5,000 position, using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the broad 
market indexes and perhaps for a sector fund or two as they break out. For 
example, you can take a $5,000 half-sized position in the NASDAQ 100 index 
fund (QQQQ), with a similar commitment to the S&P 500 index fund (SPY), 
and similarly sized positions in the cyclical and technical sector ETF. In all, 
you’d have positions totaling $20,000, which is 20 percent of your capital, 
committed to the market. That kind of commitment is appropriate for a rela-
tively risky bullish transition phase.
As stocks break out of their trading-range patterns, you may add positions, 
but you need to continue taking small positions until you’re certain the 
market has changed to a bull market. You also need to set an upper limit to 
the amount of capital that you’re willing to commit during a bullish transition 
phase, perhaps no more than 40 percent or 50 percent of your total trading 
capital.
If market conditions turn to a bull market, you then can start taking full posi-
tions and become fully invested. You may also want to reallocate your posi-
tions from the ETFs into high relative strength leading stocks. If you plan to 
use margin as leverage, a bull market is the time to do it. In this case, you 
could leverage your $100,000 of trading capital into a portfolio of stocks and 
ETFs worth up to $200,000 or more as your portfolio grows (see Chapter 14 
for more about trading on margin). You can either add to existing positions 
or add new positions in leading stocks as they break out of trading-range 
patterns. Whatever you decide, keep the number of positions small.

219
 Chapter 13: Using Fundamental and Technical Analyses for Optimum Strategy
When the market consolidates into a bullish pullback phase, you need to 
tighten your stops and consider hedging your positions. Doing so enables 
you to use your stops to get out of underperforming stocks. If you’re stopped 
out of a position, forget about it. If it’s a profitable trade, pay your taxes and 
be pleased with your profits. If you’re leveraged, you want to get out of your 
margined positions quickly whenever they move against you, so you don’t 
give up your profits.
During a bullish pullback, you first must decide whether to hedge the portfo-
lio, and then decide whether you want to hedge each individual position or 
the portfolio as a whole. In general, you’re probably concerned more about a 
marketwide downdraft than you are about a major stumble in any single posi-
tion. If that’s the case, then hedging the whole portfolio with index options 
makes sense. However, the larger the portfolio, the more sense it makes to 
hedge your individual positions.
As a bullish pullback reverts back to a bull market, reallocate your capital 
into the new leaders as they break out. After each bullish pullback, becoming 
a bit more conservative is prudent. For example, you may tighten your 
stops, use less leverage, or continue providing a hedge against a significant 
downdraft.
When the bull market transitions to a bear market, you need to exit your long 
positions when your stops are hit. You may continue to hold your positions 
as long as they’re not losing money, but don’t lose your bull market profits. If 
you want to sell short, the bear market is the time to do so.
Making profitable trades is significantly easier if you buy during bull mar-
kets and sell or sell short during bear markets. Subtleties, of course, may 
exist. You may, for example, take long positions in defensive stocks, such as 
utilities and financial companies, during bear markets. Some traders find it 
profitable to hold a two-sided portfolio, where the best-performing stocks 
are purchased and poorly performing stocks are simultaneously shorted, 
even during a raging bull market, but our advice is to keep it simple. Become 
proficient by trading with the dominant trend before trying to fine-tune your 
strategy.

Y
ou’ve picked your stock and you’re ready to enter a position. As long 
as you’re entering the position while the market is open, you have 
some flexibility in the way your order is entered and executed. However, if 
you cannot monitor the market during business hours, or if you’re entering 
your order after the market is closed, you need to be much more precise 
when placing your order and indicating the type of fill (or terms of the order) 
you’re willing to accept. Otherwise, you’re likely to run into a nasty surprise 
when you review your broker’s fill report.
This chapter reviews available alternatives when you enter an order to buy, 
sell, or sell short, and how the choices you make can affect the trade. We also 
review margin requirements, discuss how trading affects your tax return, and 
identify situations in which you can run afoul of stock-trading regulations.
Entering and Exiting Your Trade
When it’s time to enter or exit a trade, you have to tell your broker what you 
want to do. To do that, you enter an order with your broker. This order tells 
the broker the number of shares and the symbol for the stock or security 
you’re planning to trade. Your order also specifies the type of transaction 
you’d like to execute and how you’d like the broker to handle your transaction. 
See Chapter 2 for more about the types of orders available. We discuss your 
choices for instructing your broker how to handle your order in this section.

222
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Before entering your trade order, you’ll probably want to check for a stock 
quote. Ideally, your quote system provides information similar to that shown 
in Figure 14-1.
 
Figure 14-1: 
Quote 
screen for 
AT&T stock.
 
The fields depicted in Figure 14-1 are as follows:
 
✓ Description: The name of the stock and its symbol.
 
✓ Exchange: The exchange on which the stock is traded.
 
✓ Last Trade: The price recorded for the most recently executed trade 
when the markets are open. It will be the same as the close price when 
the markets are closed.
 
✓ Net Change: The change in price (+ or –) from the previous day’s close.
 
✓ Net Percentage Change: The change in price expressed (+ or –) as a 
percentage difference between the previous day’s close and the current 
closing price.
 
✓ Open: The price obtained for the first trade of the day.
 
✓ High: The highest trade price of the day.
 
✓ Low: The lowest trade price of the day.
 
✓ Previous Close: The last trade price for the previous day.
 
✓ Bid: The highest price someone is willing to pay to buy the stock.
 
✓ Bid Size: The number of shares being bid at the bid price.
 
✓ Ask (or offer): The lowest price someone has offered to accept to sell 
the stock.
 
✓ Ask Size: The number of shares being offered at the ask price.
 
✓ Close: The last trade price for the day.
 
✓ Volume: The daily trading volume.
 
✓ P/E: The price/earnings ratio (see Chapter 6)

223
 Chapter 14: Executing Your Trades
 
✓ EPS: Earnings per share (see Chapter 6)
 
✓ Last Ticks: One or more symbols showing the direction of the last few 
trades in the stock during the day, or at the end of the day for which 
the quote is effective. A plus sign or up arrow indicates a trade that was 
higher than the previous trade, or an uptick. A minus sign or down arrow 
indicates a trade that was for less than the previous trade, or a downtick. 
And an equal sign or a dash indicates a trade at the same price as the 
previous trade.
 
✓ Last Size: The number of shares for the most recent trade.
Understanding bid and ask
Most of the information displayed on the quote system is straight fact, but 
a few items need additional explanation. For example, many new traders 
are confused by the bid and ask prices through which stocks are auctioned. 
Although it seems backward, if you look at it from the point of view of the 
market maker (the people who either manage trading activity or actually 
execute the trades, see Chapter 2 for more detail), it starts making more 
sense. These professional traders make money in several ways. One way is 
by buying stocks from a retail investor (that’s what market makers call you 
and us) at one price and turning around and selling those shares to another 
retail investor at a higher price. They buy at the bid price, and then sell at the 
ask price. Their goal is to sell for a price higher than they buy.
 
A market order tells your broker to buy or sell at the current market price. 
This means that if you use a market order when buying, your order is likely to 
be filled at the ask price. When selling, your market order is likely to be filled 
at the bid price. Occasionally, your broker may be able to fill your order 
between the bid and ask prices, but you never should count on it, because it 
doesn’t happen very often. Your order can, however, become the highest bid 
or the lowest ask, if you use a limit order. A limit order specifies the highest 
price you’re willing to pay when buying or the lowest price you’re willing to 
accept when selling. If you place your limit order between the current bid and 
ask prices, your order becomes either the best bid price if you’re buying or 
the best asking price if you’re selling. Note: You run the risk of having your 
order not execute at all when using a limit order if the current market price 
moves away from your limit price. Also, the NYSE and NASDAQ each handle 
this a little differently. Your broker can help you sort through the details if you 
encounter problems.

224
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Understanding the spread
The spread is the difference between the bid and ask prices. It sometimes is 
referred to as the inside spread, which is the difference between the highest 
bid and the lowest ask. Back when stock prices were quoted in increments of 
eighths (12.5 cents) and quarters (25 cents), the minimum spread was either 
an eighth or a quarter. Today, with decimal pricing, the spreads tend to be 
tighter, and can be as low as a penny per share on actively traded stocks. 
While the major exchanges do not support spreads less than one cent, some 
ECNs (electronic communications networks, see Chapter 2) permit tighter 
spreads for a small number of securities.
 
When you place a limit order within the spread, so that your limit price is 
between the current bid and ask prices, your order will usually become either 
the best bid if you’re buying or the best ask if you’re selling. This approach 
makes sense whenever the spread is particularly wide and the price isn’t 
moving very fast. When the spread is narrow, the way it is in Figure 14-1, using 
a market order is probably best, that is, as long as the market is open and the 
stock is widely traded.
The biggest problem with trying to squeeze a profit out of the inside spread 
is that prices move. Remember that stock quotes are only snapshots of 
current bid and ask prices. By the time your order reaches the market, these 
quotes can (and do) change. Even the fastest real-time quote systems lag a 
bit behind the market, so it’s possible that the limit order you just entered 
between the spread is now outside the spread, and won’t be filled — and 
believe us when we say that can be disappointing.
Devising an effective order-entry strategy
During trading hours, you can be reasonably confident that a market order 
will be filled at or near current market prices. But if you’re like most people, 
you won’t spend all your time watching the market. As such, you need 
another strategy for entering and exiting positions. You can use one or more 
of several alternative approaches to better control the terms and prices that 
you’re willing to accept when your orders are filled.
Using limit orders
If you’re buying a stock, choose the maximum price that you’re willing to pay, 
and then pay no more. That means you can’t use market orders to enter your 
positions. Instead, you can use limit orders, which enable you to set the 
highest price that you’re willing to pay for a stock, making that your limit 
price. If you’re selling short, choose the lowest price at which you’re willing 
to sell, and set that as your limit price.

225
 Chapter 14: Executing Your Trades
Limit orders are effective for opening a position, but are problematic for 
exiting a position. For example, if you need to exit your position because 
the breakout has failed (see Chapter 9), you simply need to exit the position 
without trying to finesse the price. Failed trades recover infrequently, and 
they often get worse. You have no reason to be patient when things are going 
against you.
Similarly, whenever you have a profitable trade and you’re trying to protect 
your profits, a limit order rarely is your best choice for exiting the position. 
You’re better off exiting the position by using either a market order or a stop 
order after you’ve identified a reversal pattern.
Using stop orders and stop-limit orders to enter a trade
Traders normally talk about using stops for exiting or trading out of a position, 
but stops are also effective for opening a position. If you identify the stock 
that you want prior to an actual breakout, you can enter a buy stop at a price 
above the breakout point. These orders can be entered on a GTC (good ’til 
canceled) basis, so that even if the trading range lasts a while, your order is 
poised to trigger a transaction whenever the breakout occurs.
 
Most brokers limit the length of time that orders can remain open, so make 
sure you know your broker’s GTC policies and remember that NASDAQ 
doesn’t have any provisions for handling stop orders. If you’re trying to use 
stops when trading NASDAQ stocks, your broker has to provide the mechanism 
for triggering these trades when your stop price is hit. Make sure that your 
broker can handle the stop orders that you want to use.
 
The downside to this approach is obvious — you’re unable to confirm 
the breakout. If the breakout fails, and you’ve triggered a buy order on the 
breakout, you now hold a position that’s losing money.
Although we generally recommend waiting a few days to confirm the breakout, 
using this strategy at times may be more appropriate than others. For example, 
if you’re convinced that the market is in a bull market phase (as described in 
Chapter 13), the stock’s trading range is long and tight, and you can identify 
an obvious breakout, then entering a GTC buy stop order at a price that’s a 
bit higher than the breakout price is probably okay. However, you need to be 
much more tentative when the market is only in a bullish transition or pullback 
phase, or when you’re monitoring second and subsequent breakouts. When 
that’s the case, make sure the breakout is confirmed — that means the stock 
remains above its breakout price for a bullish breakout — within a few days 
before entering your order. If you have any doubt, wait for confirmation.
 
Another problem with this approach is that after the stop price is reached, 
your order is triggered and it becomes a market order to buy or sell. You’re in 
the exact situation you’d be in if you’d entered a market order while the 
market was closed. You have no control over the fill price after your stop is 
triggered.

226
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
For example, say the stock price gaps higher (Chapter 10) as it breaks out of 
its trading range and surpasses your stop price by two or three dollars. Your 
order is triggered and will likely be filled at a price that’s much higher than 
your stop price, and much higher than you had anticipated. If the stock price 
falls below your fill price, you’re now holding a losing position. The only way 
to avoid this problem is by using a stop-limit order, which means when your 
stop price triggers the release of your order, the order becomes a limit order 
rather than a market order and is filled only if the stock price pulls back 
below your limit price (see Chapter 2 for more on limit and market orders). 
Again, remember to confirm that your broker permits stop-limit orders on 
NASDAQ stocks.
You can also use a stop order or a stop-limit order to open a short position. 
You specify a sell stop or a sell stop-limit order, while designating your trade 
as a short sale. Again, you must confirm that your broker supports these 
types of orders for NASDAQ stocks.
Using stop orders to exit positions
After your buy or sell order is filled, you need to enter your stop-loss instruc-
tions. You need to protect your open positions and simultaneously stay clear 
of short-term traders trying to run the stops. Running the stops is a little game 
played by short-term traders where they try to find and execute open stop 
orders before driving the stock price in the other direction. It can be very 
lucrative for them and infuriating, not to mention expensive, for you. You can 
try to avoid being run over when they’re running the stops by keeping your 
stop prices away from the most obvious location. For example, if a breakout 
occurs at $35.75, don’t put your stop-loss one cent below at $35.74. Move 
down a few cents, to $35.69, or even $35.63, to stay away from the obvious 
stop-loss spots. Stop-loss measures, and the reasons for them, are discussed 
more fully in Chapter 12.
Level I, Level II, and TotalView data
The quote screen shown back in Figure 14-1 is called a Level I quote. The 
bid and ask prices, and their associated numbers of shares, give you a little 
insight into the current state of the market. However, a Level I quote won’t 
show you the full depth of the market or the number of traders and market 
makers currently participating in the market for any one stock. For that 
information, you need a Level II quote or display, or its updated cousin, a 
TotalView display.
A Level II display shows all the outstanding bid and ask prices for a specific 
stock, the number of shares associated with each price, and the identification 
of key market makers participating in the stock. Some Level II systems offer 
a display that consolidates onto a single quote screen all the outstanding 
bid and ask quotes from all the exchanges, along with all the bid and ask 

227
 Chapter 14: Executing Your Trades
quotes from the ECNs (electronic communications networks, see Chapter 2 
for details) where a stock trades. Figure 14-2 shows an example TotalView 
display for Apple Inc. (AAPL).
 
Figure 14-2:

screen for 
AT&T stock.
 
Although interesting, most of the information available on Level II or 
TotalView displays is unnecessary for a typical position trader. Unless you’re 
swing trading (see Chapter 16), day trading (see Chapter 17), or trading low-
volume stocks, you’re not likely to need a Level II or TotalView data feed.
Entering orders after the market 
closes: Be careful
As long as you’re entering your trades during market hours, using a market 
order is fine; however, if you’re planning to check your charts each evening 
and then enter your trades before heading to work in the morning, you must 
use a different approach. Otherwise you risk having your orders filled at 

228
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
prices that can differ significantly from the previous closing prices. To make 
matters worse, you may discover that your position is losing money soon 
after being filled.
Don’t be surprised to discover that many traders trade this way. Because 
of their daily schedules, they analyze stock charts in the evening and enter 
orders before the markets open. Unfortunately, common breakout and 
reversal patterns (see Chapter 9) cause many traders to react in a predicable 
fashion. After many traders enter buy orders for the same stock, a scarcity 
of that stock is likely to occur just after the market opens. Scarcity causes 
prices of individual stocks to rise, sometimes even dramatically, so that all 
those aftermarket orders are filled at prices significantly higher than the 
previous closing price. Making matters worse, after the buy orders are filled 
and buying pressure disappears, the stock price tumbles back toward the 
previous closing price.
Professional traders — including floor traders, market makers, day traders, 
and swing traders — exacerbate the problem even further. These short-term 
traders see the same technical analysis signals that you see, and their goal is 
to profit from your enthusiasm, and perhaps your inexperience, as you try to 
open your position.
As a result, you need to think about the tactics these short-term traders 
employ before you enter any positions. When they see breakout or rever-
sal patterns, short-term traders anticipate a flurry of buying activity in that 
stock, and they know that few people are going to be eager sellers when a 
stock breaks out of a trading range. Under those circumstances, the only way 
buyers can get an order filled is if they bid the price higher or accept what-
ever price is being asked for the stock. When that happens, the best asking 
price is going to be relatively high.
Someone will sell the stock to position traders but only at a relatively high 
asking price. Short-term swing traders and day traders, who may not even 
own the stock, offer those asking prices, agreeing to provide the stock to 
the position traders as long as the buying pressure pushes the price of the 
stock upward. If the short-term traders don’t own the stock, they must sell 
the shares short, in other words, they must borrow the stock before selling 
(see the section “Selling Stocks Short”). After the short sellers absorb all that 
buying pressure, the rally fades, the stock’s price falls back toward the break-
out price, and that’s when short-term traders buy the stock (at prices lower 
than they sold it) so they can cover their short positions, or in other words, 
return the shares that they borrowed to sell at higher prices to the position 
traders. How’s that for taking a quick profit.
This scenario is at the heart of why being patient usually makes sense. By 
steering clear of these moments of buying pressure, you’re more likely to get 
a much better fill, and you find out whether enough buying interest is pres-
ent to keep the stock price above the breakout price. Being patient doesn’t 

229
 Chapter 14: Executing Your Trades
always work, of course. Sometimes buying pressure drives the price higher, 
forcing short sellers to cover at a loss, which, in turn, drives the price even 
higher, resulting in a runaway stock. When that does happen, you’ll probably 
be left standing on the platform, watching the runaway stock as it leaves you 
behind. Fortunately, runaway stocks don’t happen all that often. Thus, 
banking on runaway stocks is a poor tactic.
Our advice remains the same: Don’t chase these breakout and runaway 
stocks. When the cycle exhausts itself, as it ultimately must, the stock returns 
to a more rational price, and you can reevaluate whether your position 
continues to make sense. As a position trader, you can afford to be patient.
Reviewing a week in the life of a trader
To help you get a feel for this, we’d like you to look at a sample trade made 
by a hypothetical position trader. The idea is to help you understand the 
rationale and the timing. As a position trader, your week begins during the 
weekend. You have a few things to accomplish:
 
✓ Evaluate the current state of the market.
 
✓ Evaluate the current state of your existing positions.
 
✓ Find potential replacement candidates for any failing positions.
 
✓ Find candidates for new trading positions.
We will use the week of December 8, 2008, as the example week.
Before we begin, let’s recap the market’s recent performance. The broad 
market indexes peaked in October 2007. Stocks performed poorly over the 
next year, but they accelerated to the downside in September 2008.
From the October 2007 peak to the most recent trough in November 2008, the 
S&P 500 Index (SPX), like most broad-market indexes, lost over 50 percent of 
its value. This downtrend has also seen several short, sharp rallies. The most 
recent rally in November carried the SPX 20 percent higher over the span of 
five trading days.
Because the markets rallied 20 percent, the major media declared the bear 
market over. Rather than taking their word for it, we’ll use our analysis to see 
if the persistent downtrend has ended.
The technical analysis indicators and fundamental economic conditions 
show a mixed picture:
 
✓ The economy is clearly in recession, possibly the worst economic 
conditions in our lifetime.

230
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
 
✓ The Fed lowered the Fed funds rate to its lowest point ever, near 0 
percent.
 
✓ The consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare sectors are the best-
performing sectors in the market. The sector rotation model (see 
Chapters 5 and 13) suggests that strength in these sectors often occurs 
during bear markets, before reaching the bear-market trough.
 
✓ The weekly MACD indicator (Chapter 13) for both the Standard & Poor’s 
500 Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index is far below its zero line. 
While the indicator has turned a little higher, it remains below its trigger 
line, suggesting that the market remains in a bear phase.
 
✓ The bullish percent index (BPI, see Chapter 13) for all broad market 
indexes is signaling a bull confirmed condition.
Given the above factors, you cannot conclude that a bull market has begun 
as the major media are saying. Instead, the market is most likely in a bearish 
pullback, but you cannot rule out a bull market transition.
Next, you would analyze your current positions, if you have any. Given the 
recent volatility of the market, it would not be a surprise if you were stopped 
out of your short positions. And given your conclusion that the market is 
probably in a bearish pullback, you have not initiated any new long positions.
Finally, you look for new potential trading candidates. As we write this 
chapter, for example, the news-driven market is waiting for the federal gov-
ernment’s decision about bailing out the U.S. auto industry. After the raft 
of bankruptcy announcements, including Linens and Things, Circuit City, 
and Lehman Brothers, it’s probably best to avoid individual stocks, at least 
until you see a clear indication of a new bull market. Instead, you will look at 
broad-market-index exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as sector ETFs, to 
find trading candidates.
You cannot be certain that the market is in a bearish pullback, it might be in 
the beginning of a bull-market transition. Therefore, you decide to look for 
both long and short trading opportunities. For long positions, you look at the 
strongest sectors, including the consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare 
sectors. For short positions, you look to the weakest sectors such as financial 
stocks and real estate. You can also look at broad-market ETFs for both long 
and short trading candidates.
When you search the daily ETF charts, it is not surprising that you find few 
exhibiting a long-lasting trading range (Chapter 9). One that may qualify 
is the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU). You do find several patterns that 
might be attractive for short positions (Chapters 10 and 11). For example, 
you find the Short S&P 500 Proshare Fund (SH) recently made a new high and 
is in a pullback position. This fund’s price rises when the S&P 500 Index falls.

231
 Chapter 14: Executing Your Trades
Your final step is to determine the breakout points and your entry prices 
(Chapter 9) for each of the trading candidates you’ve found. You may enter 
buy stop orders for these trades now, or you may monitor the situation and 
enter the trades as the trading signals occur.
During the trading week, your daily activities are comparatively easy. At the 
end of each trading day, you must
 
✓ Evaluate the current condition of any new or existing positions.
 
✓ Evaluate the current condition of any trading candidates you identified 
during your weekend analysis.
The markets gapped higher on Monday December 8. The Utilities Selector 
Sector SPDR (XLU) also rallied, but did not break out of its trading range. In 
fact, it remained in this trading range for the entire week.
The price for the Short S&P Proshare Fund (SH), your short-side candidate, 
gapped lower at the open, and traded in a narrow range throughout the 
day on Monday. Over the next several days, trading in SH was within a very 
narrow range. Although this isn’t the classic breakout setup we discussed 
in Chapter 9, it is very similar. The 60-minute intraday chart for SH looks 
very much like a long-running trading range. The only difference is that this 
trading range is over a period of several days rather than several weeks or 
months. You decided that the SH trade was still viable, and you entered a 
buy-stop order at $85.96, just above the high of intraday trading range. This 
trade was triggered during the day on Thursday, December 11.
Markets gapped lower the following morning, driving the price of SH higher. 
The opening price was the high price for the day. The EFT traded lower, and 
ultimately touched the top of the prior intraday trading range, but did not fall 
back into the trading range, at least not during the week we’re discussing.
Using GTC orders cautiously
You, and you alone, are responsible for moni-
toring your open orders. It is not uncommon for 
many stocks to break out almost simultaneously, 
so you need to be careful not to overcommit. 
If, by some fluke, all your open orders trigger 
simultaneously, or within a short period of time, 
you must maintain enough purchasing power to 
adequately fund all your trades. Otherwise, your 
broker will call and demand that you pay for all 
those trades that you inadvertently executed. 
Expect repercussions from your broker, includ-
ing restrictions on your account, if you don’t 
send the money immediately.

Because we are omniscient (or maybe it’s because we are writing this after 
the fact), we can tell you that this trade did not work out. During the following 
week, SH fell back into the trading range and hit your stop price, giving you a 
4.2 percent loss on this trade.
Selling Stocks Short
When you sell a stock short, you sell something you don’t have first and buy 
it later with a goal of profiting from a falling stock price. To sell a stock short, 
you borrow shares of a stock from your broker so that you can sell them in 
the open market. Your broker gets those shares either from its own inventory, 
or more likely, from other clients. The proceeds of that sale go into your 
account. To close that position, you must buy the shares on the open market 
and return them to the broker. If the price you pay for the stock, or the buy-to-
cover price, is less than your selling price, you’ve earned a profit on the short 
sale. Conversely, if the buy-to-cover price is higher, you’ve suffered a loss.
Let’s say you borrow 100 shares of Company X and sell the shares short for 
$100 per share. When the price drops to $80 per share, you buy the shares 
back (you might also say you covered the shorted shares) and return them to 
your broker. You sold the stock for $100 per share, and bought them back for 
$80, netting a profit of $20 per share. It’s exactly the same profit as if you had 
purchased the stock for $80 first and sold it for $100 later. Conversely, say 
you borrow 100 shares of Company Y and sell them for $100 per share. The 
stock price rises to $120 per share, and you decide to cover your loss. You 
buy back the shares and pay $120 per share, but you sold them for $100 per 
share. You have lost $20 per share on this trade.
Some of the quirks that are unique to selling stocks short include
 
✓ Paying dividends to the lender. If the stocks pay a dividend during the 
time a short seller holds a position, short sellers pay the dividends on 
the ex-dividend date to the people who loaned them the stocks. Short 
sellers need to keep the ex-dividend date in mind whenever shorting 
stocks.
 
✓ Being forced to close a position. Whenever the original owner sells the 
stocks you borrowed, your broker can call away the shorted shares, 
which means your broker can force you to return the borrowed shares 
by buying them on the open market at the current price. This happens 
rarely, and occurs only when no shares are available for shorting.

233
 Chapter 14: Executing Your Trades
 
✓ Mandating the execution of short sales from only a margin account. 
Short sales must be executed in a margin account, because your broker 
loans you the stock to sell short, and charges you interest on any margin 
balance in the account.
 
✓ Paying margin maintenance requirements. Your broker can force you 
to close a short position if you’re unable to satisfy maintenance margin 
requirements.
 
✓ Having no or only minimal access to selling some stocks short. Lightly 
traded stocks may be unavailable for selling short, and when they can 
be sold short, they may be more likely to be called away (which happens 
when the original owner sells the stock you borrowed and your broker 
is unable to borrow additional shares).
 
✓ Restricting short sales on certain stocks. You can’t short a stock that’s 
less than $5 per share, and you can’t short initial public offerings (IPOs), 
usually for 30 days following the IPO. And, as we learned during the 
credit crisis, regulators can prohibit short selling on whole categories of 
stocks.
 
✓ Limiting short selling to only stocks on an uptick. This uptick rule was 
eliminated in July 2007, but we would not be surprised to see it imple-
mented again, so we’ll review it here. The essence of the rule says that you 
can’t sell a stock short in a falling market. Although implemented a bit 
differently on various exchanges, the result is the same. Short sellers 
cannot easily pile into a falling stock. ETFs had been exempt from the uptick 
rule, and we expect the exception to remain if the rule is imposed again.
 
One unusual aspect of shorting is that it creates future buying pressure. Every 
shorted sale must eventually be covered, and that means that every share of 
stock that’s been shorted has to be repurchased. Future buying pressure can 
cause the price of a heavily shorted stock to jump dramatically if all the short 
sellers simultaneously clamor to get out of their positions as the price rises, a 
situation called a short squeeze. You can find out how many others are short-
ing the stock by looking at short-interest statistics published in Barron’s and 
Investor’s Business Daily near the end of each month. From those statistics, 
you get some idea whether your short position is likely to be squeezed.
Avoiding Regulatory Pitfalls
Several regulatory pitfalls may cause you problems as you trade. You want to 
avoid running afoul of these regulations. Otherwise, you risk having severe 
restrictions placed on your account.

234
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Understanding trade settlement dates
In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates 
when traders must settle their securities transactions. Stock trades, for exam-
ple, settle three business days after a trade is executed, meaning the buyer 
must pay for stock trades and the seller must deliver the stock within three 
business days after the trade is executed. For example, if your trade date is 
Monday, the trade settles Thursday, three business days after the trade date. 
Short sellers are subject to the same settlement regulations as everybody 
else. That means the short seller must deliver the borrowed shares to the 
buyer three business days following the trade.
Most securities, including broker-traded mutual funds and bonds, settle in 
this three-day cycle. The shorthand for this settlement period is known as 
T+3, which means trade date plus three days. Stock options and government 
securities, on the other hand, settle the day following the trade date, or T+1.
Your broker may insist that the money for all trades be available in your 
account before allowing you to execute any trades. Brokers can exercise this 
restriction because they’re permitted to set more stringent restrictions than 
regulations require. They can’t, however, set more lenient terms. Regardless 
of your broker’s restrictions, the trade settles during the period specified 
by SEC regulations. One consequence of this settlement cycle is that your 
broker is unlikely to allow you to withdraw funds that are part of the trade 
until the trade settles. However, brokers typically do allow you to trade with 
those funds as if they are available, as long as other trading regulations are 
not violated.
Avoiding free riding
 
Whenever you choose to trade in a cash account, you must take care to avoid 
free riding. Free riding occurs whenever you buy and sell a stock without 
depositing sufficient funds before settlement to pay for the transaction. For 
example, if you have $5,000 in your cash account and you buy 1,000 shares of 
a $10 stock, for a total transaction cost of $10,000, you receive a money call to 
deposit $5,000 to settle the trade. Of course, we ignored commission costs in 
this example.
One way that a trader may mistakenly violate the free-riding rules is trying to 
use the same capital on two transactions in a single day. Here’s the scenario: 
Say you have $10,000 of equity in your account, and you buy 1,000 shares 
of a $10 stock. Later that same day, you’re stopped out of the position. So 
far there is no problem. But if you try to reenter the position on the same 
day, then you receive a money call for the full price of the second trade. 
The bottom line: You can’t use the same capital to open two positions on 

235
 Chapter 14: Executing Your Trades
the same day in a cash account. That’s free riding. Note, however, that these 
trades are permitted in a margin account. Trading in a margin account means 
you’re not at risk of violating free-riding regulations.
 
If you fail to satisfy the money call within the specified time, your broker 
either issues a warning or places your account on restricted status. When 
you’re restricted, you have to have enough funds in your account to cover 
your trade before the broker executes your order. Restrictions usually are 
imposed for 90 days.
Avoiding margin calls and forced sales
Although trading on margin is very powerful, it also is potentially very risky. 
You may recall from our discussion about differing types of accounts in 
Chapter 2 that a margin account enables you to borrow money from your 
broker, which, in turn, permits you to leverage your trading capital. This 
leverage can improve your total return when things go well, but it can also 
amplify any losses when a trade goes against you. A margin account is 
required if you plan to sell stock short.
Before using your margin, you must become familiar with the rules govern-
ing its use. The Federal Reserve determines the maximum amount that your 
broker can loan you. Currently, the Fed permits your broker to loan you up 
to 50 percent of the value of each trade. The Fed hasn’t changed the margin 
requirement values since 1974. Prior to 1974, however, the Fed had adjusted 
margin requirements 22 times to limit stock market speculation and inflation-
ary pressures.
Understanding margin fees
Your broker charges interest on the average daily margin balance, regard-
less of whether it’s cash or stocks. The margin balance is an adjustable 
rate loan for which the interest rate is based on the current broker call rate, 
which sometimes is known as the money call rate. Brokers usually quote their 
respective margin rates as the broker call rate plus a percentage, where the 
added amount is dependent upon the size of your loan. You can find the cur-
rent broker call rate in the Tuesday edition of The Wall Street Journal.
Understanding margin collateral
Your trading positions represent the collateral used to secure your margin 
loan. Brokers require the value of your collateral to be sufficient to cover any 
outstanding loan. The amount required by your broker, called the minimum 
maintenance margin, can range from 25 percent upward. In other words, your 
broker requires the equity in your account to be at least 25 percent of the 
market value of your margined stocks.

236
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
 
If the equity value of your account falls below the minimum maintenance 
margin, you receive a margin call, a demand from your broker to deposit more 
money in your account. If you fail to satisfy your broker’s demand for addi-
tional funds, your broker liquidates some or all of your trading positions. In 
fact, your broker may even liquidate your positions before you satisfy the 
margin call, if the value of the equity in your account continues to fall. Falling 
stock prices mean falling equity values.
As an example, say that you have $10,000 in your account, and you buy 1,000 
shares of a $20 stock, which is $20,000 worth of stock. Current margin regula-
tions require that you maintain a deposit of at least 50 percent of the value 
of that trade in your account to open that trade, and 25 percent of the total 
value of the position to maintain it. After purchasing the stock, your account 
has $10,000 of equity and $10,000 in a margin loan. A margin call occurs in 
our example when the price of the stock falls dramatically the next day from 
$20 to $12, representing a loss of 40 percent. At this point, you still owe the 
$10,000 margin loan to your broker, but the total equity in your account now 
is only $2,000. The 25 percent minimum maintenance requirement is $3,000 
(that’s 25 percent of $12,000, or 1,000 shares at $12 each), so you’d receive 
a maintenance margin call to deposit $1,000 to bring your account up to the 
$3,000 minimum equity amount.
 
Notice in the example that you’re also dangerously close to owing more to 
your broker than the stock is worth. If the stock’s price falls much further, the 
broker likely will liquidate your position to satisfy your outstanding loan. 
Brokers are allowed to liquidate your position at any time, without your 
explicit approval. In fact, they’re allowed to liquidate any position in your 
account to satisfy your loan.
This example illustrates the risks of using margin. The value of the stock fell 
40 percent in the example, but you lost 80 percent of your equity. Leverage 
cuts both ways. Earning double profits may be nice, but doubling your losses 
is very painful. Our recommendation is to never satisfy a margin call — close 
the offending position instead. In our example, you should have set stops so 
you’d be able to get out of the losing position long before you got the margin 
call. But after that margin call is generated, you need to liquidate the losing 
position(s) immediately to pay off the margin loan.
 
When you open a margin account, you must sign a hypothecation agreement, a 
binding agreement that explicitly entitles your broker to liquidate positions to 
satisfy outstanding margin loans. The hypothecation agreement also permits 
your broker to loan any stock in your margin account to another client to pro-
vide shares for that client to short the stock. When you short a stock, the 
shares of the stock that you sell must come from somewhere, and that some-
where is from other clients who own the stock. If you’re the one shorting 
stock, one “gotcha” can accompany this scenario. If the stock you borrowed is 
sold to someone else, then your broker can call away your short position in a 
forced sale. Although forced sales like this don’t happen very often, they nev-
ertheless are a risk that you must assume if you short stock.

237
 Chapter 14: Executing Your Trades
Avoiding pattern day trader restrictions
Another risk you run when using a margin account is being classified as a 
pattern day trader. A day trade is defined as entering and exiting a single posi-
tion in the same day. You can buy a stock and sell it, or you can short a stock 
and cover the position. Either way, if both transactions occur on the same 
day, it is considered a day trade.
If you day trade four or more times within a five business-day period, you’re 
classified as a pattern day trader, unless your day trades represent fewer than 
6 percent of the total number of trades executed during the same period, 
which is a huge threshold. After you’re classified as a pattern day trader, 
your account must have at least $25,000 of equity before you’re permitted 
to execute additional day trades. Day trading margin rules are discussed in 
Chapter 17.
The Tax Man Cometh
Trading profits are taxable and are usually taxed as income at the trader’s mar-
ginal income tax rate. Check out Taxes For Dummies by Eric Tyson, Margaret 
Munro, and David Silverman (Wiley) for more info than most of us will ever 
need on the subject of taxes. Traders rarely hold positions long enough to 
qualify for the special capital gains treatment that is available to long-term 
investors. Still, paying taxes is better than losing profits or principal.
One tax trap that snares traders is the wash sale rule. Normally, you can 
deduct trading losses from trading gains before calculating your income tax 
burden. However, if you sell a stock for a loss and then repurchase the stock 
within 30 days, the trading loss cannot be deducted. Fortunately, the loss 
isn’t lost forever. You can use it to adjust the cost basis on the trade by the 
amount of the loss, which ultimately reduces the amount of tax owed when 
the position is finally closed. This adjustment effectively raises the cost of a 
stock purchase, for tax purposes, so you owe less tax. A similar adjustment is 
available when selling short.
Day traders receive special tax treatment, but you must be a bona fide day 
trader to qualify. The details are reviewed in Chapter 17.

Trading System
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding mechanical and discretionary trading systems
▶ Identifying the tools and data required for system development and testing
▶ Understanding the pitfalls of system optimization
▶ Evaluating trading systems that you can buy
▶ Maintaining a trading log
A
 trading system is a collection of technical and fundamental analyses 
tools woven together to generate buy and sell signals. Trading systems 
often are built using common indicators, oscillators, and moving averages 
(see Chapter 11). You can combine these various technical-analysis tools to 
create a virtually unlimited number of trading systems. For the new trader, 
the advantage to this approach is that you don’t need to invent something 
new to create and personalize a workable system.
The downside, however, is equally obvious. Many traders use these common 
tools and end up with a system that offers little competitive advantage and 
only modest (if any) profits. In addition, these systems can be difficult to use, 
because the signals of one trading system mirror the signals of many others, 
which makes entering and exiting positions troublesome.
Ultimately, you want to develop or adapt a trading system that closely fits 
your personality and trading objectives. This chapter helps you methodically 
develop and add to a trading approach that utilizes your own personalized 
repertoire of trading systems. It also helps you recognize and avoid destruc-
tive and costly habits that can sabotage your trading efforts. In addition, we 
discuss ways for you to evaluate some of the claims being made by trading 
systems that are for sale and whether buying someone else’s trading system 
makes sense.

Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Understanding Trading Systems
Although individual trading systems differ in many ways, thinking about 
them on the basis of a couple of broad characteristics is helpful. The first 
characteristic has to do with the two ways a trader interacts with the system. 
In this case, trading systems are one or the other of the following:
 
✓ Discretionary trading systems: A system that presents trading 
candidates for your consideration, but leaves the final trade execution 
decision to you.
 
✓ Mechanical trading systems: A computer-based system that automatically 
generates buy and sell signals that will always be traded.
The other way to categorize a trading system is by how it treats trends in the 
markets. In this case, trading systems are one or the other of the following:
 
✓ Trend-following trading systems: A system that tries to identify trade 
entry and exit points for new or existing trends.
 
✓ Countertrend trading systems: A system that tries to identify trade 
entry and exit points by finding tops and bottoms.
Although these categorizations are not mutually exclusive of each other — 
mechanical and discretionary systems, for example, can both be trend-
following systems — each approach has adherents and detractors, so we 
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each type of system in the sections 
that follow.
 
As you read through our descriptions of the trading systems, understand that 
no system generates profits without any losing trades. Put another way, no 
system works in every situation. Keep that firmly in mind when you’re devel-
oping ideas for and designing your personal trading system. Your goal needs 
to be designing a trading system that is useful to you across a large number 
stocks and a large number of situations. Believe us when we say that you will 
run into trouble whenever you try to tailor a trading system to a specific 
stock. Additionally, try making your system work across long periods of time 
and across many different market conditions.
Discretionary systems
A discretionary trading system makes you an active participant in all phases 
of the trades you make and provides you with a great deal of leeway when 
making trading decisions. With this approach, evaluating the economic data, 
analyzing the broad market indexes, determining which sectors are showing 

241
 Chapter 15: Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System
strength, and identifying high relative-strength stocks that are breaking out 
of long trading ranges and hoping to catch a new trend all are up to you. 
You make decisions based on what you see in charts and in fundamental 
economic data, and you enter and exit (buy and sell) positions based on that 
information.
 
A discretionary system requires a great deal of discipline, which can be a 
source of problems for some traders. This type of system works well for trad-
ers who are capable of making good decisions quickly under pressure. But dis-
cretionary systems may prove troublesome if you allow your emotions to 
wreck havoc with your ability to think clearly, act rationally, and make 
thoughtful trading decisions.
When emotions cloud your trading decisions, you may end up
 
✓ Overtrading
 
✓ Prematurely liquidating your positions
 
✓ Holding positions too long
 
✓ Anticipating trading signals in attempts to get better entry and exit 
prices
Another problem with discretionary systems is that they’re difficult to test, 
which probably is their greatest drawback. System testing is useful, because 
it helps you understand situations in which an indicator works well and in 
which it fails. With a discretionary system, you can test the indicators, but 
you cannot reliably test your discretion.
Mechanical systems
A mechanical system addresses some of the problems that arise when using 
discretionary systems. Mechanical systems usually are computer-based 
programs that automatically generate buy and sell signals based on techni-
cal and/or fundamental data. You’re expected to blindly follow the resulting 
trading signals. Some mechanical systems actually enter buy and sell orders 
directly with your broker without your intervention.
 
If your greedy impulses or your fear of losing routinely cause you to make 
poor trading decisions, a mechanical system may be a better choice for you. 
An automated approach tends to reduce the stress and anxiety that arise 
when you have to make difficult decisions quickly. As such, you can make and 
execute trading decisions in a consistent, methodical way. A mechanical trad-
ing system also enables you to automatically include rigorous money manage-
ment in your trading methodology.

242
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Another benefit of the mechanical approach is having the ability to 
thoroughly test the system. Through testing you can confirm whether 
your trading system performs the way you expect it to and explore ways 
to improve your system before actually committing your trading capital. 
You can adjust and fine-tune your system after seeing the test results. 
Unfortunately, fine-tuning your system may lead to other problems. We 
discuss ways to avoid them in the “Identifying system optimization pitfalls” 
section, later in this chapter.
Trend-following systems
Trend following is favored by many technicians for one simple reason: 
Trends offer excellent opportunities for profit. Unfortunately, the popularity 
of the trend-following approach is one of its weaknesses. Too many of these 
systems generate many similar buy and sell signals, which, in turn, makes 
outperforming the average trader difficult for any individual trend-following 
trader.
Even the best trend-following systems have a relatively large percentage of 
failed trades, primarily because they depend on several extremely profitable 
trades to make up for the large percentage of losing trades. If your trend-
following system also is a discretionary system, your discretion (or lack of 
it) can cause you to miss a few of these profitable trades, and your overall 
results will suffer.
 
Trend-following systems typically are based on either moving averages or 
breakout patterns (see Chapters 9 and 11). Moving average–based trading sys-
tems are the most popular and can be quite profitable; however, they work 
only when a stock is trending. These trading systems depend on long-lasting 
trends to generate enough profit to outweigh a relatively large number of 
losing trades. In fact, the number of losing trades can easily outnumber win-
ning trades with this trading system. When a stock is range bound (stuck in a 
specific price range), a moving-average system generates a large number of 
losing trades. Because of the large overall number of trades, this system often 
is accompanied by relatively high transaction and slippage costs (see the sec-
tion “Accounting for slippage”). Money management is critical when using a 
trend-following trading system.
You can make some adjustments to a trend-following system that may 
improve its performance. For example, you can insist that its trading signals 
be confirmed by another condition before actually entering any positions. If 
your system triggers a buy signal, for example, you may want to see whether 
the signal remains in effect for at least a day or two before entering a posi-
tion. We show some examples of moving-average and breakout systems, 
along with some ideas to improve the performance of these systems, in the 
section “Developing and Testing Trading Systems.”

243
 Chapter 15: Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System
Countertrend systems
 
For many traders, the quest to find a profitable countertrend trading system is 
all-consuming. Countertrend systems appear desirable because their goal is to 
buy low and sell high. These systems try to identify inflection points, or the 
moments when stocks change direction, so traders can take positions close to 
when they occur. This approach may work in a few narrowly defined situa-
tions, such as in a trading range (Chapter 9) or a trend channel (Chapter 10), 
but it is likely to fail in a spectacular and expensive way if attempted on a 
broader scale.
The vast majority of trading systems follow market trends. Trend-following 
systems tend to outperform countertrend systems, especially for position 
traders. Swing traders and some day traders sometimes use a countertrend 
approach, but even then, they usually do so in conjunction with a trend-
following component.
Countertrend systems usually depend on oscillating indicators, reversal pat-
terns, and channeling strategies to find turning points. Some countertrend 
systems also are based on cycle theory, and others are based on volatility, 
expansion, and contraction. We briefly review some of these techniques in 
Chapter 16.
 
We discourage you from spending too much time evaluating countertrend sys-
tems, at least until you’re confident in your ability to use trend-following sys-
tems to successfully make your trades. Countertrend systems generate a large 
volume of trades, and the more you trade, the more you spend on transaction 
and slippage costs. These costs alone often swamp potentially profitable sys-
tems. Although a countertrend strategy can sometimes work profitably in a 
trading range or trend channel (Chapters 9 and 10), it is still risky, especially 
for a new trader.
Selecting System-Development Tools
Conceptually, you can use the back of an envelope to develop your trading-
system ideas. However, most traders want some way of confirming that their 
newly designed systems can perform profitably before they commit real trad-
ing capital. That means you need a way to test your system, which further 
means using computer software to precisely define the system and evaluate 
its performance. Typically, this requires simulating trades by using historical 
data.

244
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
 
Regardless of whether you decide on a mechanical or a discretionary 
approach to trading, your system will benefit from testing. Although thor-
oughly testing a discretionary system is difficult, you can still test the compo-
nent indicators to learn when they do and don’t provide effective trading 
signals. To begin, you need a computer, development and testing software, 
and historical data.
Choosing system-development hardware
Doing the math that’s required when testing your system can really slow 
down your computer, and it can generate a lot of data. Almost any computer 
will do the job when you’re getting started, but if you end up testing many 
system ideas, you definitely need a large amount of disk storage and a fast 
computer. The computer equipment required to run a proprietary trading 
platform, including products such as TradeStation or MetaStock, is usually 
enough for system development and testing. (See Chapter 4 for more infor-
mation about the hardware requirements for a typical proprietary trading 
platform.)
Selecting system-development software
Many trading system–development and testing products are on the market. 
Some proprietary trading platforms, such as TradeStation or MetaStock, 
include system-testing capabilities. Spreadsheet software, like Microsoft’s 
Excel, also is useful for analyzing simple trading systems and for analyzing 
the results generated by specialized-development and testing software.
Trading system–development and testing software
You need to consider several of the following criteria when evaluating your 
system-development and testing software:
 
✓ All trading system–development and testing programs use some type 
of computer language to describe and test your system. Some are terse 
and difficult to use, others are more intuitive. Traders with strong com-
puter or programming skills have little problem mastering any of these 
languages, but others may struggle. Pay careful attention to this devel-
opment language before selecting a system. Be certain that you’re actu-
ally able to use the system you choose.
 
✓ You need to integrate your trading system with your stock charts. Some 
system-development software requires you to actually write computer 
code that enables you to display your trading system and stock charts 
simultaneously. Avoid these systems if you’re uncomfortable writing 
computer code.

245
 Chapter 15: Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System
 
✓ The manner and effectiveness by which your system-development and 
testing software reports on how your trading system is performing is 
critical. Some systems provide extremely detailed statistics about the 
performance of your trading systems. Others, however, list little more 
than the buy or sell signals. In general, more information is better.
 
✓ Make sure your system-development and testing programs are capable 
of exporting the data they generate, historical price data included, into a 
spreadsheet program for further analysis.
TradeStation is the gold-plated system-development platform. It has many 
built-in tools that make your development and testing job relatively easy. 
For those of you on tight budgets, one of the less expensive alternatives 
you may want to consider is a charting and system-development program 
like AmiBroker (www.amibroker.com). Although flexible and powerful, 
AmiBroker isn’t as feature-rich or polished as TradeStation, and it requires 
significantly more effort on your part. For example, AmiBroker includes 
well-known technical-analysis indicators like moving averages and MACD 
(see Chapter 11), but the number of indicators included is a tiny subset com-
pared with what TradeStation offers. Similarly, you have to use AmiBroker’s 
formula language to create and enter any other indicators that you may be 
using.
Spreadsheet software
 
A spreadsheet program is another invaluable testing and analysis tool. 
Although a spreadsheet program can’t do everything that a specialized sys-
tem-development and testing program can do, it can add quite a bit of analysis 
horsepower to your system-development tool kit. You can actually code and 
test simple trading systems directly into the spreadsheet. You can also evalu-
ate the results of your trading-system tests more thoroughly using the spread-
sheet’s built-in statistical and analysis functions.
You can, for example, copy the price data for a stock into your spreadsheet, 
calculate moving averages and other indicators, and then configure buy, sell, 
or sell-short signals. You can also export trading signals from your system-
development program and import the results into your spreadsheet for fur-
ther analysis.
One of our favorite spreadsheet projects is calculating the maximum favor-
able and unfavorable moves after our system has triggered a buy or sell 
signal. Simple to do, it helps you understand the strengths and weaknesses of 
your trading system in great detail. You can see whether problems with your 
trading system might be solved by using different exit procedures or tighter 
(or looser) stop-loss points.

Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
For example, although your entry signals may show promise, your exit signals 
may be causing you to leave a lot of money on the table. These situations are 
hard to see when you’re working only with charts; however, they sometimes 
jump out when you’re working with raw data during your spreadsheet analy-
sis. You can find an example using this testing technique in the “Working 
with breakout trading systems” section, later in this chapter.
Some system-development programs provide a great deal of statistical analy-
sis, so choosing between spreadsheet tools and system-development tools is 
a trade-off between thoroughness and expediency. After you’ve been through 
the testing exercises a few times, you get a feel for the strength of each 
approach. So it’s likely that you’ll decide to use both a system-development 
program and a spreadsheet program when creating and testing your new 
trading systems.
Finding historical data for system testing
When you need to test your system, you can, of course, test it in real time, 
with real money, and in the real markets. But getting some idea of how your 
system will perform before risking your hard-earned capital is usually better. 
Typically, that means testing your system by evaluating how it performs 
when simulating trading using historical price data. Ten to twenty years of 
historical end-of-day data for the indexes and stocks in which you plan to 
trade is usually more than enough to properly simulate trades for testing 
your system.
Many sources can provide the data. You can download historical data from 
the Internet, and some online data is available free of charge. Some proprietary 
trading platforms likewise include access to historical data. You may want to 
get data from more than once source to confirm its accuracy.
Yahoo Finance provides free historical data and permits you to download the 
data into a spreadsheet. To access the Yahoo data feed, get a quote for the 
stock and select “Historical Data” under the Quotes menu item. Then click 
“Download to Spreadsheet.”
Many online services offer data in a more convenient format, but for a price. 
Some sell historical data recorded on CDs. Sources for intraday price data 
also are available. Here are the URLs for a few of the many sites offering 
various forms of historical data:

Developing and Testing Trading Systems
The ideas that you may want to include in your system development and 
testing are virtually limitless. Many new traders begin system testing by 
combining a few off-the-shelf indicators in an effort to obtain better trading 
results. Doing so is as good a place as any to begin.
 
However, we want to caution you to keep your systems simple enough that 
you can understand not only the system but also the result. Simplicity usually 
is better when trading, especially when you’re first becoming familiar with the 
processes of system development and testing. We describe the process by 
looking at a couple of examples in the sections that follow.
Working with trend-following systems
Many trend-following systems use a moving average for their starting points. 
In this trend-following example, the system is designed for position trading, 
which means we use a relatively long moving average. Short-selling won’t be 
permitted with this simple system.
The first step is defining buy and sell rules for your initial testing. The actual 
code for defining these rules depends on your specific system-development 
package. Therefore, trading rules are described as generally as possible. The 
rules for an initial test may look like this:
 
✓ Buy at tomorrow’s opening price when today’s price crosses and closes 
above the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA).
 
✓ Sell at tomorrow’s opening price when today’s price crosses and closes 
below the 50-day EMA.

248
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
To test whether using a moving average as a starting point is a good idea 
in a trend-following system, apply these two rules to ten years of historical 
data for the stock or stocks of your choice. After testing this idea, you find 
that this simple system works fairly well when stock prices are trending, but 
it’s likely to trigger many losing trades when the prices of stocks are range 
bound. You can try to avoid these losing trades, and possibly improve your 
overall trading results, by filtering out trading-range situations. One way to 
accomplish that goal is by changing the buy rule to read: Buy at tomorrow’s 
open when the following conditions are true:
 
✓ Today’s closing price is above the 50-day EMA.
 
✓ The stock crossed above the 50-day EMA sometime during the last 
5 days.
 
✓ Today’s 50-day EMA is greater than the 50-day EMA from 5 days ago.
These added conditions serve as signal confirmation. When you test these 
rules, you find they reduce the number of whipsaw trades for most stocks, 
but they’re also likely to delay buy and sell signals on profitable trades, and 
thus usually result in smaller profits on those trades. Yet this adjustment 
makes the overall system more profitable, because the number of losses is 
reduced.
You can find out whether other changes that you can make in your simple 
system actually can improve profitability. You may, for example, test differ-
ent types of moving averages. Try, for example, a simple moving average 
instead of an exponential moving average (see Chapter 11 for the types of 
moving averages). Or, you may want to try using different time frames for 
your moving average, such as 9-day, 25-day, or 100-day moving averages.
Identifying system optimization pitfalls
Most system-development and testing software comes equipped with a pro-
vision for system optimization, which allows you to fine-tune the technical 
analysis tools used in your trading system. You can, for example, tell the 
system to find the time frame of the moving average that produces the high-
est profit for one stock, and then ask it to do the same thing for a different 
stock. Some systems enable you to test this factor simultaneously for many 
stocks.
 
Although something is alluring about using this approach, doing so is likely to 
cause you trouble. If you find, for example, that a 22-day moving average 
works best for one stock, a 37-day moving average works best for the next 
stock, and another stock performs best using a 74-day moving average, you’re 
going to run into problems. The set of circumstances leading to these opti-
mized results won’t likely repeat in precisely the same way again. We can 
almost guarantee that whatever optimized parameters you may find for these 
moving averages won’t be the optimal choices when trading real capital.

249
 Chapter 15: Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System
This is a simple example of a problem that is well-known to scientists and 
economists who build mathematic models to forecast future events. It is 
called curve fitting, because you are molding your model to fit the historical 
data. You can expend quite a bit of effort fine-tuning a system to identify all 
the major trends and turning points in historical data for a particular stock, 
but that effort is not likely to result in future trading profits. In that case, your 
optimized system is more likely to cause a long string of losses rather than 
profits.
 
Testing a long moving average and comparing the results to a short moving 
average is fine, and so is testing a few points in between a long moving aver-
age and a short moving average. As long as you use this exercise to under-
stand why short moving averages work best for short-term trades and why 
longer moving averages work better for traders with longer trading horizons, 
you’ll be fine. Otherwise, you’re probably moving into the realm of curve fit-
ting and becoming frustrated with your actual trading results.
Testing with blind simulation
 
Blind simulation is a method for setting aside enough historical data so that 
you can test your system optimization results and avoid the problem of curve 
fitting. For example, you may test data from 1990 through 1999, and thus 
exclude data from 2000 through the present. After you’ve developed a system 
that looks good enough for you to base your trades on, you can then test your 
system against the data that was excluded. If the system performs as well with 
the excluded data as it did with the original test data, you may have a system 
worth trading. If it fails, you obviously need to rethink your system.
Another approach is choosing your historical data with extreme care. You 
can expect trend-following systems like a moving-average system to perform 
well during long, powerful trends. If your stock had a strong run-up during 
the long-lasting 1990s bull market, that kind of price data can skew your 
results, magically making any trend-following system appear profitable. 
Whether that success actually can be duplicated during a subsequent bull 
market, however, must first be thoroughly tested.
 
If the majority of your profits come from a single trade, or only a small number 
of trades, the system probably won’t perform well when you begin trading real 
money. You may want to address this problem by excluding periods from 
your test data when your stock was doing exceptionally well or when the 
results of any trades were significantly more profitable than the average trade. 
This technique is a valid approach to eliminating the extraordinary results 
arising from extraordinary situations in your historical data. Using it should 
give you a better idea of your system’s potential for generating real profits in 
the future.

250
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Working with breakout trading systems
Similar to moving average–based systems, a breakout system can take many 
forms. You may already be familiar with the trading-range breakout system 
we describe in Chapter 10. To test a different approach, you can define a 
breakout system as follows:
 
✓ Buying at tomorrow’s opening price when today’s closing price is above 
the highest high price that occurred during the last 20 days.
 
✓ Selling at tomorrow’s opening price when today’s closing price is below 
the lowest low that occurred over the last 20 days.
These trading rules are loosely based on the rules for Donchian Channels 
(sometimes called Price Channels), which comprise a breakout system devel-
oped by Richard Donchian in the 1950s. Donchian was one of the early devel-
opers of trend-following trading systems.
A spreadsheet may be helpful for evaluating this system. You can, in fact, 
configure this system into a spreadsheet, include buy and sell signals, and 
perform analyses to determine how well the system performs. You also can 
use the spreadsheet to dig into the system’s results to find out what works 
and what doesn’t. Figure 15-1 shows an example.
Re-creating the spreadsheet in Figure 15-1 is straightforward. After download-
ing the historical price data into a spreadsheet format, all you have to do is 
encode the formulas into the correct columns. The formulas are described in 
the nearby sidebar “Creating the Donchian Channel spreadsheet.”
If you’re like most traders, the first thing you’ll do is calculate some statistics 
about the system. For example, you can use spreadsheet functions to calcu-
late the following:
 
✓ Total gain or loss for the system
 
✓ Average gain (the numerical average)
 
✓ Median gain (the middle result)
 
✓ Maximum gain for any single trade
 
✓ Maximum loss for any single trade
 
✓ Standard deviation
Then you can look at aggregate results to find out whether the system 
actually made money. In the case of the Donchian Channel breakout system, 
initial results don’t look promising. The system lost money during the entire 
test period.

If you’re like most traders, your impulse is to discard the idea and move on to 
another. But with the Donchian Channel breakout system, you need to dig a 
little further before you do. During the time frame of this test, the system 
triggered 30 trades, 18 of which were losing trades. However, 13 of those 
losing trades were profitable at some point during the process, and all the 
winning trades gave back a large part of the profits before the sell signal was 
triggered. In fact, many of the profitable trades gave back significantly more 
than half of the profits before the sell signal.

Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
Figure 15-1 shows how a single position from the spreadsheet progressed. 
The entry trade was triggered when the price of QQQQ closed above the 
September 4 Donchian high. In this simulated trade, the stock was purchased 
at the September 5 opening price of $49.56 and then sold on November 9, the 
day after the price of QQQQ closed below the November 8 Donchian low.
If you look through the last three columns, you’ll notice that this simulated trade 
was profitable, but closed well below its most profitable price. If that happens 
once during simulated trading, you may not need to worry much about it, but if 
it occurs frequently, you need to think of ways to remedy the problem.
In the Donchian Channels system, buy signals apparently work better than 
sell signals. Therefore, you need to consider different types of stops and sell 
signals. One simple idea that’s worth testing is stopping out (selling at a 
predetermined price) of a position if the stock’s low (instead of its close) falls 
below the Donchian low. Another is to shorten the time frame for the exit 
signal by using a five- or ten-day Donchian Channel. Or you can, for example, 
use a trailing stop or some completely different criteria to exit these positions.
In any case, this example gives you ideas about how you can use a spread-
sheet to test and analyze any trading system. It also provides you with some 
suggestions about how you can use this kind of analysis to improve your 
system’s results.
Creating the Donchian Channel spreadsheet
The opening, high, low, and closing prices for 
the QQQQ exchange-traded fund were copied 
into columns B through E of the spreadsheet 
found in Figure 15-1.
You need at least 20 rows worth of data before 
you can calculate the first Donchian price 
channels. (These first 20 rows are not shown in 
Figure 15-1.) The following calculations assume 
that column headers are in the first row, and 
the price data begins in the second row. After 
entering a formula in the following columns, 
copy the formula for that column to every row 
that has price data.
The remaining columns are configured as 
follows:
 ✓ Column F is the upper Donchian Channel. 
Use the spreadsheet MAX function to find 
the highest price value for the previous 20 
trading days. Start this calculation in row 
22, giving 20 rows of data. The calculation 
for row 22, Column F is =MAX(C2:C21).
 
 Notice that the formula doesn’t include 
the current row. If it did, the current close 
would never cross above the Donchian 
Channel line.
 ✓ Column G is the lower Donchian Channel. 
Use the MIN function to find the lowest low 
for the previous trading day. Start this cal-
culation in row 22, using 20 rows of data. 
The calculation for row 22, column F is 
=MIN(D2:D21).
 
 As for the upper Donchian Channel, the for-
mula does not include the current row.
 ✓ Column H is the Change Flag indicator. This 
flag is a simple way to avoid triggering more 
than one sequential buy or sell signal. It’s 

253
 Chapter 15: Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System
also useful for calculating the remaining 
cells. Simply stated, the cell displays either 
TRUE for a buy signal or FALSE for a sell 
signal. If yesterday’s close is greater than the 
Donchian high, turn on the TRUE condition. If 
yesterday’s close is less than the Donchian 
low, turn on the FALSE condition. Otherwise, 
copy the TRUE or FALSE condition from the 
previous day into this column .
 
 In row 22, column H, type the formula 
=FALSE(). Then, in row 23, column H, the 
formula is =IF(E22>F22,TRUE(),IF(E22<G22,
FALSE(),H22)).
 ✓ Column I is the Buy/Sell indicator. This 
column shows when a buy or sell signal first 
is triggered. It compares the current Change 
Flag value with the previous value. If they’re 
equal, a dash goes in the cell. Otherwise, 
the word “Buy” is shown when the Change 
Flag is TRUE and “Sell” is shown when it’s 
FALSE. The formula for row 23, column I is
=IF(H23=H22,”-”,IF(H23,”Buy”,”Sell”)).
 ✓ Column J is the Buy Price. This column 
shows the trade entry price. If the Buy/
Sell flag indicates a buy, then put today’s 
opening price in the cell. Remember the 
trading rule is to buy at the opening price 
on the day following the trade entry signal 
and sell at the opening price on the day fol-
lowing the trade exit signal. Therefore, the 
sell signal requires a special case. If the 
Change Flag indicator is TRUE for either 
today or the previous day (the special sell 
signal case), copy the trade price from 
the previous day to today. Otherwise, the 
Change Flag is FALSE, so leave the cell 
blank. The formula from row 23, column J is
=IF(I23=”Buy”,B23,IF(OR(H23,H22),J22,””)).
 ✓ Column K is the Gain/Loss indicator. This 
column shows a running total of the gain 
or loss in the trade, assuming the trade 
closes at the current opening price. The 
first row after a buy signal always shows 0 
percent. The last row following a sell signal 
is the actual gain or loss from the simulated 
trade. The formula from row 23, column K is
=IF(OR(H22,H23),(B23-J23)/J23,””).
 ✓ Column L is the MFE, which is short for Most 
Favorable Excursion. This column shows a 
running total of the best possible outcome 
for the trade as though it were closed at 
the high price of the day. This column is 
useful for what-if analyses but not for esti-
mating your actual gains or losses. You 
rarely, if ever, sell at the high price for the 
day, or the MFE for a trade. The calcula-
tion is simple. If the Change Flag indica-
tor is TRUE, and if today’s high is greater 
than the purchase price, calculate the 
percentage gain. Otherwise, leave the cell 
blank. The formula from row 23, column L is
=IF(H23,IF(C23>J23,(C23-J23)/J23,””),””).
 ✓ Column M is the MAE, or Most Adverse 
Excursion. This column shows a running 
total of the worst possible outcome for 
the trade as though it were closed at the 
low for the day. This column is useful for 
what-if analyses but not for estimating 
actual gains or losses from the trade. You 
rarely, if ever, sell at the low price for the 
day, or at the MAE for a trade. The calcu-
lation is simple: If the Change Flag indica-
tor is TRUE, and if today’s low is less than 
the purchase price, calculate the percent-
age loss. Otherwise, leave the cell blank. 
The formula from row 23, column M is
=IF(H23,IF(D23<J23,(D23-J23)/J23,””),””).
Make sure you have copied the formulas in 
each column to every row that includes price 
data.
To evaluate the results, you can copy the trad-
ing signals, gain and loss values, and MFE and 
MAE values from your system to a new spread-
sheet. Paste the values using the spreadsheet’s 
Paste Special function. You then can sort and 
analyze the data in any way you choose.

Accounting for slippage
Slippage is the term traders use to describe the costs of trading, which is 
made up of two components. The first is the actual transaction or commis-
sion cost for executing your trade. The second is more difficult to measure, 
because it’s the sum of the cost of unfavorable fills. If, for example, you’re 
planning to buy at tomorrow’s opening price based on today’s closing price, 
those two prices can be much different. An unfavorable fill is a cost of 
trading, and accounted for as slippage.
Most trading system–development packages have a provision for estimating 
slippage costs when testing your trading ideas using historical data. If you 
know your transaction costs, enter the exact amounts. Otherwise, estimate 
the transaction cost. You probably need to overestimate the cost of unfavor-
able fills, because it always seems to end up being worse in actual trading 
than most traders ever imagine. You may want to start with an estimate of 
25 cents per share and adjust it as you gather data on your actual slippage 
costs.
Keeping a Trading Journal
Keep track of all your trading activities in a trading journal. Doing so even-
tually turns your trading journal into a reference manual that can become 
an invaluable tool for helping you recall what you’ve done to identify what 
works and what doesn’t. A trading journal also can help you analyze your 
trades and trading systems to determine which aspects of trading you do 
well and which ones you need to work on.
When you develop a trading system, save ideas and test results in your jour-
nal. When you enter a position, record everything about the trade. Include 
your thoughts as you contemplate making the trade. When you have a what-
was-I-thinking moment later on, you can find the answer in your journal.
Using a loose-leaf binder to hold your trading journal is probably best. Print 
before and after charts for each trade and include them in the journal. Keep 
detailed notes about each trade, and about the system you used to trigger 
the trade. At a minimum, your notes need to include the following:
 
✓ Trade date
 
✓ Stock symbol
 
✓ Number of shares, and why you chose that number of shares

255
 Chapter 15: Developing Your Own Powerful Trading System
 
✓ Whether you bought long or sold short
 
✓ Which system triggered the entry signal
 
✓ Which system triggered the exit signal
 
✓ Where you placed your initial stops
 
✓ If and why you moved your stops
 
✓ What caused you to exit the position and why
 
✓ The percentage gain or loss from the trade
 
✓ Whether any economic reports or announcements were made around or 
during the time of the trade
 
✓ Your thoughts, hopes, and fears that you had before opening the 
position and while the position was open
You can also use your journal to save magazine articles that influenced your 
thinking. Cut out and save the new high and new low lists from the newspaper. 
Keep a record showing leading and lagging industries. Save sector charts 
along with your trade records. Whatever information you use to make trading 
decisions needs to be in your trading journal.
 
You can improve only the things that you measure. Record statistics about 
your trades. Include the duration of each trade, the MFE, and the MAE. After 
you close a trade, write down what you might have done differently. Find out 
whether you can identify signals that can help you recognize similar situations 
in future trades.
Although keeping the journal is important, it is useful only when you review it 
regularly. Spend a little time every week or month reviewing all your trades, 
so you can pinpoint consistent mistakes or missed opportunities.
Evaluating Trading Systems for Hire
You’ll see advertisements on the Internet, in trade magazines, and in newspa-
pers for foolproof systems that promise amazing returns. Sometimes you’ll 
even see claims for systems that regularly return hundreds of percent with 
little or no risk.
Although some stocks do actually achieve astronomical returns of hundreds 
and sometimes thousands of percent, those cases are rare. Consider this: A 
system that offers profits of 100 percent per year supposedly grows $10,000 
into $10 million dollars in only ten years. Be skeptical. Experienced traders 
know that no system consistently returns 100 percent per year.

256
Part IV: Developing Strategies for When to Buy and Sell Stocks 
If you created such a system, would you sell it?
When evaluating these systems, the devil is in the details. Advertisements 
often are unclear about how a system actually works in real-world trading, 
and some vendors make claims based on nothing more than the results of 
system testing based only on simulated trades and historical data. In fact, the 
system’s author may never have traded the system using real capital.
Constructing a system that shows great profits when simulating trades with 
historical data is easy. If you designed a trend-following system and tested it 
against data during the period 1997 through 2000, or from 2003 through 2007, 
you can be fairly certain that the system is going to perform well in simulated 
testing. But that doesn’t mean you should use it to trade real money.
If a system sounds too good to be true, well, it probably is. So do your own 
homework. Find out what works and what doesn’t, and save your hard-
earned trading capital for trading.

S
wing trading is a trading strategy that tries to take advantage of short-
term opportunities in the market. It occupies the middle ground 
between position trading and day trading. Swing traders use trend-following 
and countertrend strategies to participate in trading-range and trending 
stocks. This turbo-charged trading style requires an exceptional understand-
ing of the inner workings of the markets and excellent analysis capabilities.
In this chapter, we discuss a few of the basic techniques used by swing trad-
ers along with the risks that are unique to the discipline. We also talk about 
tax issues and account restrictions unique to swing trading.
Stock Selection Is Key
 
Swing trading is a technical discipline. Although there is no hard and fast rule, 
swing traders often trade in 1,000 share increments and usually limit the 
number of simultaneous positions to ten or fewer. A swing trade can last for 
as little as a few hours to as long as a few weeks, but typical swing trades span 
no more than a few days. On this kind of time scale, fundamental analysis 
has little impact on a stock’s price movement; therefore, stock selections are 
made using technical analysis tools. Careful trade management is crucial to 
swing trading success.
Stock selection is even more important for swing trading than it is for posi-
tion trading. When you’re looking for a stock to move right away, you base 

260
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
your decisions on selection criteria that are different from when you’re posi-
tioning for a move that may last for several weeks to several months. A few of 
the important selection criteria that swing traders use are
 
✓ Volume and liquidity: Swing traders typically focus on actively traded 
and relatively large stocks. The goal is finding stocks that are easy to 
buy, sell, and sell short. When trading time frames are short, you need 
to be able to execute your orders quickly. Unfortunately, stocks with 
the greatest liquidity and trading volumes are closely followed by the 
largest number of professional traders, which usually constrains the 
number of profitable swing trading opportunities, so swing traders often 
scout opportunities outside of the 25 or so stocks that have the highest 
trading volume and greatest liquidity.
 
✓ Trending: Trending stocks provide the best opportunity for swing-
trading profits. You may use either the methods described in Chapter 
9 for identifying trending stocks or the average directional index (ADX) 
indicator. This indicator has three components, the ADX reading, and 
two directional movement indicators — the +DMI and the –DMI. An ADX 
reading of more than 30 or so indicates a trending stock. A comparison 
of the two DMIs shows you whether the AMX is trending up or down. 
If the value of +DMI is larger than the value of –DMI, then the stock is 
trending higher. If the value of –DMI is larger than the value of +DMI, the 
stock is trending lower. The ADX indicator is included in most charting 
applications.
 
✓ Volatility: Swing traders depend on larger, or more volatile, short-
term moves for profits. As a result, they want to trade stocks that have 
histories of making large moves in short periods of time. One popular 
approach to finding them is keeping an eye on the average daily ranges 
(ADRs), which are simple moving averages that track the day-to-day 
differences between an individual stock’s daily high and low prices. If 
you’re swing trading, you want stocks that show high ADRs. Volatility 
also can be measured using historic volatility, which is discussed in the 
“Trading volatility” section.
 
✓ Sector selection: Just like position trading, swing traders try to trade 
stocks in the strongest sectors, and the weakest sectors are candidates 
for short sales. Use the techniques described in Chapter 13 to identify 
strong and weak sectors.
 
✓ Tight spreads: As a means of controlling slippage (see Chapter 15), 
you need to pay close attention to the difference between the bid and 
ask prices of the stocks you’re considering as swing-trading prospects. 
Stocks with wide spreads make profitable swing trading difficult. Low-
priced stocks rarely are good candidates for swing trading, because the 
spread, as a percentage of the stock price, is usually too wide.

261
 Chapter 16: The Basics of Swing Trading
Swing-Trading Strategies
Swing trading fluctuates between the use of trend-following and countertrend 
strategies:
 
✓ When a stock is trending strongly, swing traders primarily employ trend-
following techniques, but may use countertrend techniques to fine-tune 
exit points.
 
✓ When a stock is range bound, swing traders use countertrend methods 
to identify entry and exit points.
Trading trending stocks
 
Technical analysis patterns that we cover in Chapters 9 through 13 are all 
applicable to swing trading. Patterns repeat in all time frames. The difference 
is in how swing traders use and interpret these common patterns. Trend-
following strategies are more aggressive for swing trading than they are for 
position trading. Although swing traders use some of the same indicators and 
patterns used by position traders, they often use them in different ways. We 
explain a few examples in the sections that follow.
Trading pullbacks
A pullback is another name for a consolidation within a trend. Consolidation 
patterns include the flags and pennants discussed in Chapter 10. Swing trad-
ers use daily charts and intraday charts — ranging from 1-minute bars to 
60-minute bar charts — to identify the dominant short-term trend and any 
pullback patterns within the trend. They try to enter a position when the 
price of a targeted stock stops declining or pulling back, so they can capture 
the next move higher in the trend. Conceptually, pullback trading is simple, 
but in practice, it’s trickier than it sounds.
After you identify a trending stock and find a flag or pennant pullback pattern 
(Chapter 10) by visually examining the daily charts, you must try to enter a 
position just as the pullback is ending. The classic setup is finding an orderly 
pullback in which the high of each bar on a chart of the pullback is lower 
than the previous one. Figure 16-1 shows an idealized example of the type of 
pattern you’re trying to find.

Pullback
Entering a position is done by placing a buy-stop order with your broker. A 
buy-stop is like any stop order; when the price is hit, the order is executed. 
See Chapter 12 for details. Entering a position to trade pullbacks is an itera-
tive process so it’s best to use a day order instead of a GTC (good ’til can-
celed, see Chapter 14) order. Here are the steps:
 
✓ Select your buy-stop price so it’s just above the intraday high price 
shown in the last bar of the chart.
 
✓ If the stock price trades above your buy-stop price, your order is exe-
cuted. Otherwise, the order is canceled at the end of the day.
 
✓ As long as you’re still interested in this trade, adjust your buy-stop price 
to just above the intraday high of the most recent bar on the chart and 
reenter your order.
 
✓ After your order is filled, place a stop-loss order (Chapter 12) using a 
stop price just below the intraday low of the lowest bar in the pullback 
on the chart.
 
✓ As long as the trade is active, continue adjusting the stop price to be 
just below the intraday low of the most recent bar on the chart.
Figure 16-2 is a price chart of the stock of National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV), 
that’s showing a strong uptrend. Several opportunities for trading pullbacks 
are also shown on this chart.
The first pullback occurred after NOV traded to a new high of $30.44 on 
January 23, 2007. That new high is labeled Bar #1 on the chart. After identify-
ing the pullback, you begin the iterative process of setting the buy-stop price 
just above the high of the last bar on the chart. At the end of each day, you 
reset the buy-stop price, again setting it just above the high of the last bar, 
and reenter the order.
In this example, the trade is triggered on Bar #2, which occurred January 30. 
You had set the buy price just above the January 29 high, which was $29.44. 
NOV opened January 30 at $28.90. The trade was triggered when the stock 

263
 Chapter 16: The Basics of Swing Trading
climbed above $29.45, rising as high as $30.01 before backing off to close at 
$29.80. You could expect your order to fill very near your $29.45 buy-stop 
price. For the sake of our example, we’ll assume a fill price of $29.50.

Bar #1
Bar #3
Bar #5 Bar #7
Bar #2

Immediately following the trade execution, you set a stop-loss order below 
the low of the previous bar, $28.74 in this case. Or you may set the low at 
$28.90, the trade day’s low. Either approach makes sense, so it’s your call. 
Each day the trade remains active, reset the stop order just below the low of 
the previous bar on the chart.
The thrust of this trend lasted through February 12, 2007, a duration of ten 
trading days. This position hit the stop price on February 12, labeled Bar #3 
on the chart in Figure 16-2, when the stock traded below the February 9 low 
of $33.03.
The next opportunity to trade a pullback occurred during the pullback that 
began after NOV traded at a new high on February 13, labeled Bar #4. The 
trade was triggered on February 21, shown as Bar #5, when NOV traded 
above the February 20 high of $33.85. The position hit its stop price on 
February 27, shown as Bar #6, when the stock traded below the February 26 
low of $34.91. Given slippage and transaction costs, this trade was no better 
than a breakeven trade.

264
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
The next opportunity came following the poorly formed pullback that began 
with Bar #6. You entered the trade on Bar #7 when NOV traded above the 
February 28 intraday high of $35.00. The trade would stop out two bars later 
for a loss.
Swing trades don’t always work out, of course. Complications and frequent 
losing trades always are likely.
Surfing channels
Another trend-following approach to swing trading uses a channeling strategy 
to identify entry and exit points. Chapter 10 explains the channeling strategy 
and how to construct the channel lines. After a channel is identified on the 
daily charts, channel lines are treated as lines of support and resistance. 
Figure 16-3 shows an example.
 
Figure 16-3: 
Chart of

Engineering 
Group, Inc. 
(JEC) in

channel.
 
Resistance Channel Line
Support Channel Line
After identifying support and resistance levels for a channeling stock, you 
can monitor its chart for reversals near the channel lines. As the stock price 
approaches the lower or support channel line, you have an opportunity to 
take a position in the direction of the trend. After entering a position, your 
stop-loss order is entered just below the support channel line. As the stock 
price approaches the upper or resistance channel line, that signals when to 
exit your position.

265
 Chapter 16: The Basics of Swing Trading
 
You can use intraday charts to fine-tune this strategy. As a stock price falls 
toward its lower channel or support level, begin watching intraday charts for 
indications that the stock is changing direction and heading higher. If you see 
an intraday low near the location of the support channel line, followed by a 
higher high and a higher low, you can use that situation as an entry signal. 
After entering a long position, you place a stop-loss order just below the sup-
port channel line.
You hold this long position until it either is stopped out or the stock 
approaches its upper channel resistance level. Again, you need to moni-
tor the intraday charts for hints of a change in direction and exit the trade 
whenever you see the reversal. After that, you wait for the stock to head back 
toward the lower channel line to initiate a new long trade.
Trading range-bound stocks
Unlike the typical position trader, a swing trader is more likely to use coun-
tertrend strategies (see Chapter 15) and actively participate when a stock 
is range bound. The swing trader tries to make trades based on price move-
ments from the bottom to the top of the range and back down again. You can 
use either daily or weekly charts to identify the trading range. An example 
using a daily chart is shown in Figure 16-4.
Your trading approach to range-bound stocks is similar to the one for trad-
ing a channeling stock that we describe in the previous “Surfing channels” 
section. As the stock price approaches the support level, which is just above 
$59.00 in Figure 16-4, you have an opportunity to take a position. You can use 
the a few approaches to enter a position.
You can, for example, simply choose to place a buy order using a limit price 
just above the support line. Another approach that may give you a little more 
control and provide better entry and exit points is to monitor the stock to 
find pivot points as it trades near the support line. A pivot point is a three-bar 
pattern in which the low price of the middle bar is lower than the lows of the 
bars on either side of it. The entry and exit points for this kind of trading are 
similar to the ones used for trading based on a pullback pattern. After iden-
tifying a pivot point, you enter an order on the next bar. The protective stop 
is placed either immediately below the low of the pivot bar or just below the 
support channel line.

Using intraday charts is another way to fine-tune your entry point. As the 
stock approaches the support line, you enter a position as soon as you see 
a reversal pattern on the intraday charts — for example, a higher high and a 
higher low, or a gap higher (Chapter 10).
You exit these kinds of positions when the stock reverses near its resistance 
line. You can then take a short position in the stock — using any of the entry 
techniques described earlier — or wait for the stock to return to the support 
line to initiate another long position.
If the stock breaks through its upper resistance level, you interpret that 
condition exactly the way a position trader does — a very bullish indication 
that the stock is likely beginning a new trend, immediately closing any open 
short positions and converting to a trend-following strategy (see the earlier 
“Trading trending stocks” section).

267
 Chapter 16: The Basics of Swing Trading
Trading volatility
Swing traders try to trade stocks that move up and down more than average. 
To find these stocks, swing traders spend a great deal of effort measuring 
and analyzing volatility, usually in the form of historic volatility. Although 
the math required to calculate historic volatility is complex, the concept 
is simple. Historic volatility measures a stock’s price movement. The faster 
it moves, the higher the historic volatility. Fortunately, many charting and 
analysis programs include a method for calculating historic volatility, so you 
don’t have to program in the formula.
Swinging with Gann and Taylor
Swing trading has been around in one form or 
another since the earliest days of markets. The 
term itself probably originated with W. D. Gann 
when he invented the swing chart during the 
1920s. George Douglass Taylor popularized the 
phrase, and a short-term trading technique, 
when he introduced a now classic three-bar 
trading pattern in his 1950 book, The Taylor 
Trading Technique.
Taylor’s ideas serve as the basis for much of 
today’s swing-trading methodology. According 
to Taylor, trending stocks tend to rally, then 
rest, and then continue to trend. Swing trad-
ers watch for these rest periods and attempt to 
enter the market just in advance of the thrust of 
the new trend.
Taylor’s method, sometimes called “the book 
trader’s method,” was originally developed to 
trade futures contracts in the grain markets. 
Taylor theorized that the market cycles through 
three distinct phases or days. The first phase 
is the buy day, the second is a sell day, and the 
third is a sell-short day. Although these three 
days don’t necessarily fall on consecutive days, 
for the sake of following the discussion, we 
assume they do.
Taylor first determines the short-term trend, 
finds the position of the short-term cycle within 
the trend, and then uses this information to 
determine when to buy, sell, or sell short. The 
buy day begins the cycle. A typical buy day 
begins with weakness, and the trader takes a 
long position near a previously identified sup-
port level based on the weakness. This posi-
tion is held overnight into the next day, the 
sell day. The sell day typically opens strong, 
but the strength fades before the close. The 
trader sells at the early signs of weakness. The 
final day of the cycle is the sell-short day. The 
trader watches for any strength near resistance 
levels on the third day and sells short into this 
strength. The short position is held overnight 
and then covered during early weakness the 
following buy day. The cycle begins in earnest 
again with the trader initiating a long position 
after covering the short position.
Taylor’s approach is difficult to execute. Like 
all swing trading, it requires constant moni-
toring of the market and an excellent under-
standing of support and resistance levels. It 
is a discretionary approach that is difficult to 
test. Few stocks actually follow a three-day 
script on consecutive days. Many stocks trend 
for several days before pulling back or rising, 
so the three-bar method must be adjusted to 
account for these differences. Nevertheless, 
Taylor’s thinking is evident in much of today’s 
swing-trading methodology.

Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
 
Historic volatility isn’t concerned with the direction of a stock’s price move-
ment. A high historic volatility value doesn’t reveal whether a stock’s price is 
rising or falling. Although swing traders want to know that a stock trends in 
one direction or the other, they don’t really care which direction. Downside 
movement is just as attractive as upside movement to the swing trader.
 
You can use historic volatility for swing trading in several different ways. One 
popular approach uses historic volatility for finding stocks that have been 
very volatile but currently are experiencing quiet periods. These temporarily 
quiet stocks often return to previous levels of historic volatility, and that pres-
ents a swing-trading opportunity. Swing traders identify these stocks by com-
paring measurements of historic volatility across longer and much shorter 
periods of time and expressing that comparison as a ratio. The ratio looks 
like this:
Historic volatility ratio = Short-term historic volatility ÷ Long-term 
historic volatility
One common ratio compares a 6-day historic volatility with a 100-day historic 
volatility. Whenever the value of that ratio is less than 50 percent, the stock 
is a candidate for a swing-trading position.
After this stock takes a short low-volatility rest, it is likely to return to its 
historic level of volatility with a fast move. Remember that volatility tells you 
nothing about the direction of price movements, so to get around this limita-
tion, be sure to place buy and sell-short stop orders, respectively, above the 
high and below the low of the current bar. When the stock decides which 
way it will go, one of your stop orders will be filled and that should get you 
pointed in the right direction. Using more traditional technical analysis tools 
is another approach to evaluating a stock’s current trend, so you can then 
trade in the direction of that trend.
 
Risks accompany both approaches. Using the first approach, the stock may 
take off in one direction and quickly reverse course, and you may end up 
holding a position with a highly volatile stock heading the wrong way. This 
same scenario also can happen with the second approach. Another potential 
problem occurs when the stock price gaps through your entry order, and your 
order may end up getting filled at a price that’s significantly different than you 
expected.
Money management issues
Because of the short duration of each trade, swing trading generates a large 
volume of trades. Execution and slippage costs (Chapter 12) can be very 
high. Profits are relatively small when measured on each trade, so losses 
must be carefully controlled.

269
 Chapter 16: The Basics of Swing Trading
 
You need to adhere closely to the money management rules we discuss in 
Chapter 12. In addition, each swing trade must represent only a small per-
centage of your trading capital. Ten percent of your capital per trade is too 
much. Risking less than 5 percent — and perhaps as little as 2 percent — of 
your trading capital on any one swing trade is a more conservative approach. 
This approach is similar to the one used by professional traders. When profit 
potential is small, don’t take big risks, or you won’t be a swing trader for long.
Using Options for Swing Trading
Stock options can be used as substitutes for the underlying stocks when 
swing trading. A stock option is a limited duration contract that grants the 
option buyer the right to either buy or sell a stock for a fixed price. The option 
seller, usually called the option writer or the option grantor, is granting the 
right to the option buyer to either buy or sell a specific stock for a fixed 
price.
Each option represents 100 shares of stock. A call is an option to buy 100 
shares of a specified stock. The call buyer is acquiring a limited duration 
right to buy 100 shares of a stock from the option grantor at a fixed price, 
called the strike price. A put is an option to sell 100 shares of a specified 
stock. The put buyer is acquiring a limited duration right to sell 100 shares 
of a stock to the option grantor at the specified strike price. Options are dis-
cussed in more detail in Chapter 18.
You can, for example, substitute a call option for a long stock position or a 
put option for a short stock position. You realize any profits by selling the 
options outright, or you can exercise an option and take possession of the 
shares of stock. Swing traders, however, are more likely to sell the option 
than exercise it.
Although using options as stock substitutes has several advantages, it also 
has risks of its own. The primary advantage: An option costs far less than 
the underlying stock, which enables you to limit your risk to the price of the 
option.
Each option is a substitute for 100 shares of stock or 100 shares of an 
exchange-traded fund. One call option, for example, gives you the ability to 
buy 100 shares of a stock at a fixed price for a certain length of time. As an 
example, assume that the QQQQ exchange-traded fund is trading at $27.10 
per share. At the time of the example, you can buy one call option with a $27 
strike price for $2.26 per share, or a total of $226, before transaction costs. 
That one option enables you to buy 100 shares of QQQQ for $27 before the 
option expires.

270
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Say that the option in this example has approximately six weeks before 
expiration. Your option position is therefore profitable as long as the QQQQ 
exchange-traded fund trades above $29.26 (excluding transaction costs) 
before the expiration date. (We determined the breakeven price by adding 
the $27 strike price to the $2.26 cost of the option, which totals $29.26.) Your 
risk is the price of the option. In other words, you can’t lose any more than 
$2.26 per share, or $226, on this trade.
Unfortunately, option pricing is not as straightforward as stock pricing. 
The pricing example above is merely a snapshot that varies with changes 
in the price of the QQQQ exchange-traded fund. The following factors affect 
option prices:
 
✓ Options expire and their prices decay as the expiration date draws 
closer. This price decay is caused by the option’s falling time value.
 
✓ The prices of current-month options decay at faster rates than longer-
dated options.
 
✓ In percentage terms, out-of-the-money options often move at a faster rate 
than in-the-money options. (An option is said to be in the money if it has 
intrinsic value and out of the money if it has no intrinsic value. For a call 
option, that means the price for the underlying stock is greater than the 
specified strike price. For a put, that means the price for the underlying 
stock is less than the strike price. See Chapter 18 for additional details.) 
Note: Trading options that are far out of the money is rarely a good 
strategy.
 
✓ Volatility is a component of option pricing. Option prices rise and fall as 
the volatility of the stock rises and falls.
 
✓ Except in a few unusual circumstances, an option’s price doesn’t move 
in lock step with the underlying stock’s price. If a stock moves $1, the 
option, in general, moves some amount less than $1. The more an option 
is in the money, the closer the change in an option’s price will be to the 
change in the underlying stock’s price.
Another factor to consider when substituting options for stocks is that the 
option’s spread, or the difference between the bid price and the ask price, is 
extremely wide when considered as a percentage of the option price.
Before you decide to substitute options for your stock trades, make sure that 
you understand the option-pricing model. We discuss it in Chapter 18. And be 
careful that you don’t overtrade with options. If you normally buy 100 shares 
of a stock, then you need to buy only one option contract. Although the price 
of 10 option contracts may be attractive when compared with the price of 
the stock, 10 option contracts nevertheless represent 1,000 shares of stock. 
When buying options for 10 times the number of shares that you normally 
trade, you’re increasing your exposure to risk by a factor of 10.

271
 Chapter 16: The Basics of Swing Trading
 
When trading options, you can’t make money in as many ways as you can 
lose it. Being right on the stock’s direction but still losing money on an option 
trade is possible because of pricing issues. That’s why gaining an understand-
ing of the option-pricing model is so important before you try to substitute an 
option for a stock. We discuss options more fully in Chapter 18.
Getting a Grip on Swing-Trading Risks
Swing trading is risky and demands a great deal of time. As a swing trader, 
you must monitor the market during every trading hour. You also must be 
able to control your emotions so that you stay focused and trade within 
your plan.
Ask any swing trader; you’re likely to hear that strict adherence to money 
management reduces risk. The counterargument is that swing trading 
exposes a great deal of capital to risk but makes only small profits. Some 
traders are able to swing trade profitably, but you need to realize that the 
odds are stacked against you. Only you can decide whether it’s worth the 
effort.
Some argue that swing trading combines the worst aspects of position trad-
ing with the worst aspects of day trading. Like day trading, swing-trading 
profits are small and slippage costs are high. Swing-trading positions are held 
overnight, so swing traders can’t take advantage of the special margin provi-
sions that are available to day traders who close all positions by the end of 
the trading day. And swing traders are subject to the same account restric-
tions as day traders, but they may not qualify for the special tax advantages 
afforded to full-time day traders.
Taxes (of course)
Special tax treatment is available from the IRS for full-time traders. The 
benefits enable full-time traders to be taxed as a business rather than an 
investor, and that means you can deduct the cost of the computer hard-
ware and software used for trading, and you can treat your home-office 
expenses, including the costs for data acquisition, as ordinary business 
expenses. Furthermore, you can convert capital gains and losses to ordinary 
gains and losses under the Mark-to-Market accounting rules in the IRS Code 
Section 475. Mark-to-Market rules enable you to avoid wash-sale regulations 
and deduct all losses against other income, without hitting the $3,000 cap 
imposed on other investors.

272
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Unfortunately, swing traders do not necessarily trade every day, so some 
swing traders have a difficult time qualifying for these special tax provisions. 
If you are unable to qualify as a full-time trader, then your swing trades will 
be taxed in the same way as every other investor. You must report gains and 
losses on IRS Schedule D, and you must adhere to wash-sale regulations. You 
may also run into difficulty if you try to report your trading expenses as a 
business deduction.
The rules are complex. You need to consult with your tax advisor to determine 
your eligibility. Information about the rules is in IRS Publication 550, Chapter 4, 
“Special Rules for Traders.” We provide more information in Chapter 17.
Pattern day-trading rules apply
Swing traders are subject to the same rules as day traders. If a swing trader 
opens and closes a position in a single stock during one day, and does this 
more than four times in a five-day period, the swing trader is categorized as 
a pattern day trader. If this occurs, the swing trader must maintain an equity 
balance of $25,000 in his account or his broker will prohibit him from making 
any day trades. Additional information about the pattern day-trading rules is 
provided in Chapter 17.
This scenario actually is quite likely for the swing trader, because of the 
number of stops that are hit. As a swing trader, you may as well plan to main-
tain a minimum equity balance in your trading account in excess of $25,000.

D
ay traders enter and exit trading positions sometimes more than a hun-
dred times within a single day. Day traders may even get into and out of 
a position within the span of only a minute or two.
Some players compare watching the charts and jumping quickly in and out of 
positions to the rapid-fire action and excitement of a video game. However, 
much more is at risk. Instead of merely losing a game, a bad move can mean 
the loss of your entire portfolio, or maybe even more. Yes, day traders some-
times end up in negative positions, owing money to the firms with which 
they’re trading. We explain how that can happen later in this chapter.
For now, you need to know that day traders rarely hold a stock overnight 
and that watching a computer screen for hours at a time is a critical part of 
the day for this high-stress type of trading. Although neither of us is or ever 
has been a day trader, in this chapter, we nevertheless explain how this 
type of high-risk trading works, give you some common strategies used by 
these types of traders, explore restrictions the United States Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) places on day traders, and show you the high 
levels of risk day traders face.
What Day Trading Is All About
Day traders try to fashion a career out of buying and selling stocks quickly 
throughout the day. A certain amount of day trading is critical to maintaining 
the liquidity of the stock market, because the techniques they use keep the 
market moving. They’re known as institutional day traders — specialists and 
market makers.

274
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Retail day traders, on the other hand, are a different bunch. They make 
dozens or even hundreds of trades a day, but they also close out all their 
positions at the end of each day. Retail day traders use technological devel-
opments that first became available in the late 1990s to get in on the action 
that used to be the sole province of the institutional day traders.
Institutional day traders (market 
makers and specialists)
Specialists, who may soon take on the title of market makers, are a critical 
part of the New York and American stock exchanges. All are members of an 
exchange either as an individual, a partnership, or part of a corporation. 
They’re responsible for making markets in certain exchange-traded securi-
ties, maintaining inventories of the securities for which they’re responsible, 
and making sure the market for those securities is orderly.
Market makers play a critical role in maintaining the liquidity and efficiency 
of NASDAQ-listed stocks and stocks that are sold over-the-counter and not 
listed in a particular market. They’re usually part of a brokerage firm or bank 
that facilitates the buying and selling of stocks in these markets. A market 
maker must be ready to buy and sell stock on a regular and continual basis. 
More than 500 firms operate as NASDAQ market makers.
Specialists and market makers trade into and out of positions throughout the 
day, often executing orders in a matter of seconds. We discuss these types of 
traders in greater detail in Chapter 2.
Retail day traders
Retail day traders try to make money in a totally different way. The play-
ing field of day trading opened for retail day traders in the late 1990s when 
computer software was developed that enabled individual investors to have 
direct access to securities markets in ways that previously were only tech-
nologically available to licensed and registered professionals. We talk more 
about licensing and registration in Chapter 20. Today, regulators believe 
retail day traders are responsible for about a third of NASDAQ’s trading 
volume. Although stocks listed on the NASDAQ are a common choice for day 
traders, the preferred trading platform for most day traders is the electronic 
communications network, or ECN, because being connected to the markets in 
this manner makes becoming the highest bid or lowest ask price easier than 
doing so via directly trading on the NASDAQ (see Chapter 2). Since the NYSE 
bought ARCA (an ECN), the difference between NASDAQ and listed stock 
has shrunk, and we’re now seeing significant day trading volume on both 
NASDAQ and NYSE stocks.

275
 Chapter 17: The Basics of Day Trading
It’s all about access
Brokerage firms that promote day trading provide their customers with real-
time links to the major stock markets and the NASDAQ system, which, in 
turn, gives them information not readily available to average retail investors. 
Brokerages also provide customers direct entry into their order-processing 
systems. This direct access enables day traders to send their orders to a 
particular market or market maker and to determine the order route — a 
task that only licensed professionals previously were able to accomplish. 
Although other online and traditional brokerage houses may provide real-
time quotation information, they don’t offer their customers linkages to 
markets and market makers. Instead, some have preset algorithms that deter-
mine where a customer’s order is routed for execution, which may or may 
not be the cheapest way to go. Many times the algorithms are set based on 
trading agreements among firms without regard to cost effectiveness.
Why does direct access matter so much? Speed and, again we say, speed! 
Systems that provide more and more direct access give day traders the 
opportunity to execute their trades within seconds. In addition, by using 
a more direct route, traders can choose market makers whose bid or ask 
prices look the best and fill their orders instantly.
Traders also can post bid or ask prices directly on an ECN, or they cancel 
orders with the click of a button, all because they have direct access. When 
establishing a position using a limit order through a traditional online broker, 
traders must fill out another ticket to cancel their trades, and under those 
circumstances, they can’t know whether their orders have been filled until 
they receive a trade or cancel confirmation.
Day traders aren’t looking to make a large profit on one huge sale every day, 
but instead they seek smaller profits on much more frequent changes in the 
positions they establish during the day. Mere seconds are critical when you’re 
trying to get in and out of a position, trying to make money on small stock 
price differences that may be much less than a single point, which, in trading 
lingo, translates to a dollar in the nontrading world. Although swing traders 
and position traders seek profits of several points (dollars) with each position 
they enter, day traders may exit their position after earning a profit of only 
a few cents. Traders usually buy or sell at least 1,000 shares at a time, so 25 
cents translates into a $250 profit for every 1,000 shares traded. Note: In only a 
matter of seconds, what looked like a good price to a day trader can be lost.
By controlling where their orders are sent, day traders also gain better con-
trol over the costs of their trades. One of the ways that some traditional 
brokers make money on trades they execute for customers is charging a fee 
called a payment for order flow. These fees can be a penny or more per share 
of stock, providing something of a kickback to the brokerage house and 
enabling deep discount brokerages to charge smaller upfront commissions 
that barely cover the cost of their trades. Although online discount brokers 
send trades to particular markets or market makers through which they’ve 

276
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
established trading deals, day traders have the inside information to select 
the routes that give them the best prices.
Day-trading firms
In addition to direct access, day-trading firms provide (for a fee of course) 
their customers with training in how to participate in this rapid-fire, price-
sensitive buying and selling and then encourage their trainees to use their 
strategies and their software. These firms developed proprietary software 
and systems that day traders use to analyze and chart activity and execute 
orders. This software usually is available only at on-site trading facilities or 
downloadable to your computer rather than being used through Web sites.
 
Day trading through a Web site isn’t usually done, because the added seconds 
it takes to download price information and then send back an order is likely 
to result in the loss of your order to some other trader. Even when a trader 
has high-speed Internet access, too much time can be spent waiting for pages 
to load and sending orders. So to be successful, day traders need the instant 
access they get through proprietary software.
Day-trading firms are organized in one of two ways — as traditional broker-
dealers (day traders open accounts with the firm and trade using their own 
accounts) or as proprietary trading firms (or a prop firm for short) that either 
sell interest in the firms to traders who want to day trade or hire traders as 
independent contractors. Typically, a proprietary trading firm is organized as 
a limited liability company (LLC), which is a corporate structure used to mini-
mize the legal exposure of the firm. LLCs are not a separate entity for tax pur-
poses, but still enjoy many of the legal protections offered to C Corporations. 
You can find a directory of proprietary trading firms at Traders Log (www.
traderslog.com/proprietarytradingfirms.htm). Some of these firms 
offer stock trading, and others focus on futures and options trading.
As part owners or contractors rather than customers, day traders are associ-
ated with the firm, and as such, they can trade using a portion of the firm’s 
capital. Most of these arrangements require traders to put up at least $25,000 
to buy in. More often, however, the buy-in required is closer to $100,000. 
This arrangement enables day traders to use much more leverage than tra-
ditional broker-dealer arrangements, where borrowing on margin is limited 
to amounts held in individual traders’ accounts under Regulation T margin 
requirements. We explain how margin accounts work in Chapter 14. In addi-
tion to buying into the LLC, traders for these firms also are required to get 
a Series 7 license, and some firms require Series 55 and Series 63 licenses, 
which we discuss in Chapter 20.

277
 Chapter 17: The Basics of Day Trading
Understanding Account Restrictions
Regulation T is one of the key restrictions in the SEC arsenal of tools for con-
trolling day trading. Rules related to the settlement of stock transactions and 
borrowing from others to meet margin requirements also limit what day trad-
ers can do.
The Fed’s Regulation T: 
Margin requirements
The world of day trading became much more restricted in August 2001 when 
the SEC approved amendments to Regulation T that focus on pattern day 
traders. Your broker and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) 
consider you a pattern day trader whenever you buy and sell (or short and 
cover) any security on the same day within a margin account four or more 
times during any rolling five-day period. Days when the markets are closed — 
Saturday, Sunday, and market holidays — are not included when calculating 
the rolling five-day period.
 
After you’re designated a pattern day trader, you’re required to maintain a 
minimum of $25,000 of equity in your margin account before you’re ever per-
mitted to do any more day trading. For most day traders, that means having 
at least $25,000 in cash at the end of every trading day. This limitation can 
impact other investing activities in your account, so if you’re considering 
day trading, be sure to talk with your broker to gain an understanding of the 
impact that margin account minimums have on other stock transactions you 
may want to make within your account.
After you’ve been designated as a pattern day trader and maintain the 
$25,000 minimum in your margin account, you’re entitled to borrow up to 
four times any amount you maintain in your margin account. For example, if 
you maintain $50,000 in your account, this gives you up to $200,000 of day-
trading buying power. But remember, this extra buying power is limited only 
to intraday trades. If you hold positions overnight, you cannot take advan-
tage of the day-trading margin when opening a position. You must adhere to 
the traditional 50 percent initial margin requirements.
Typically, day traders are flat, or back into a cash position by the end of the 
trading day for all day trades; otherwise, you risk a margin call (see Chapter 
14). Whenever your day-trading activities result in a margin call, you have 
five days to deposit cash or securities in your account to meet the call. If 
you fail to meet the margin call, your account will be restricted to traditional 
margin requirements.

278
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Although brokerage firms are not required to monitor whether day-trading 
accounts fall below the $25,000 minimum throughout a given trading day, 
customers must cover any losses incurred in their accounts from the pre-
vious day’s trades before they’re allowed to continue day trading. If a day 
trader exceeds the four times-leverage rule during the day, a brokerage firm 
can impose additional restrictions on the account to protect itself from addi-
tional risk and prevent any recurrences of such activities.
Members of FINRA are required to issue day-trading margin calls to pat-
tern day traders who exceed their day-trading buying power. Traders then 
have five days to meet these calls. Until a margin call is met, the day-trading 
account’s buying power is restricted to traditional margin requirements, 
which allows the day trader to leverage equity only two times. For example, 
if a day trader has $50,000 of equity, but the account is restricted due to 
exceeding buying power constraints, the day-trading buying power is only 
$100,000. These stricter requirements begin on the trading day after buying 
power is exceeded and stay in place until the trader either meets the call by 
depositing the necessary cash or securities or until five business days have 
passed. After five business days have passed and the day trader still has not 
met the call, the day trader is limited to trading only on a cash-available basis 
for 90 days or until the call is met.
Traders can’t meet the call and then just take the money right out again. 
Funds deposited to meet the call must be left in the account for at least two 
business days. Traders also can’t use cross-guarantees (guarantees from third 
parties) for the margin call. The cash or securities must be deposited directly 
in the account.
Settlement: No free rides
An official stock transaction is settled three days after the date of the trade, 
meaning that day traders frequently are buying and selling stocks before 
their transactions are officially settled. Day traders can’t free ride, meaning 
they can’t buy a security and sell it an hour later without first having enough 
funds to cover the settlement of the initial trade. If a trader buys a stock or 
other security, he or she must have the funds to cover the initial trade even if 
the security is sold for a profit within the same day.
A margin account with leverage of four times excess equity is what enables 
day traders to get around this rule. To play within these rules, all the trader 
needs to have is sufficient cash to pay for the shares or sufficient reserve in 
his or her margin account. Brokers can restrict use of margin funds for three 
days until a stock transaction is settled, but they’re not required to do so.
Before trading, be sure that you understand the restrictions your broker 
imposes on margin accounts related to stock transaction settlements. The 
settlement time for options is the next day, as opposed to the three-day 

279
 Chapter 17: The Basics of Day Trading
waiting period for stocks. To trade using options, funds must be in the 
account before you place the trade or you’ll be stuck wiring funds around, 
which can add plenty to the costs of your trading.
Strategies for Successful Day Trading
As mentioned throughout this chapter, day traders trade stocks in lots of 
1,000 shares or more, putting large portions of cash at risk with every trade. 
Although the profit potential is great, so is the risk of losing all your money 
and maybe even owing money if you use borrowed cash in your margin 
account.
 
Before you ever consider day trading, you need to understand the risks you’re 
taking and how to control them. Otherwise, money can flow out of your 
account very quickly. Studies show that it generally takes six months to learn 
how to be a successful day trader, and during that learning curve, you can 
count on losing money. Success rates of day traders range from 10 percent to 
30 percent of those who try it. In other words, 70 percent to 90 percent of the 
people who attempt day trading don’t succeed and frequently end their day-
trading careers in debt. We explain more about risks in the “Risks Are High; 
Rewards Can Be Too” section, later in the chapter, but first we need to review 
some of the basic strategies that day traders use.
Technical needs
Number one on the list of things you need to become a day trader is a very 
good computer and Internet setup. They’re necessary for successful day trad-
ing. Most traders have two or more monitors with a PC built to handle a large 
number of data feeds at one time. Windows XP or Vista are the preferred plat-
forms of day traders, because most of the trading platforms are written for 
these environments and because they’re able to handle multiple monitors.
Daily computer maintenance is critical for day traders. Computer problems 
are the last thing you want to experience in the middle of your trading day, 
especially when buy positions are left open. You can lose a lot of money if 
you’re waiting for your computer to reboot and a trade goes sour. Traders 
recommend that you clear the cookies (files that Web sites send to your 
computer when you’re using them) from your Internet cache on a daily basis 
and that you defragment (reorganize your files so the computer runs more 
efficiently) your computer at least once a week.
Another key step is finding an Internet service provider (ISP) that is reliable 
and offers high-speed access to the Internet. Many traders have more than 
one ISP lined up, so they have a backup in case the first one goes down. 

280
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Again, you don’t want to lose even mere seconds when you’re in the middle 
of your trading day, especially when you have open positions.
Trading patterns
Day traders make use of patterns seen in technical analysis that are similar to 
the ones we discuss in Part III of this book. One common pattern that day trad-
ers look for is a price gap in a stock at the opening of the market. They find that 
prices usually move in the same direction as the opening price gap during the 
first few minutes that the market is open and then the market tends to reverse 
and fill the gap (see Chapter 10). Trading that doesn’t fill the gap during the 
first five to ten minutes can signal a dominant trend for the day for that particu-
lar stock. Some traders watch this action to find their targets for the day and 
the directions they plan to play them. There is no consensus on this, of course. 
Others believe early market moves give false signals and that using those 
moves for planning your trading day can be dangerous.
Traders watch for many of the same patterns they find when looking for 
breakout signals and signs of reversals (see Chapter 10). The key difference 
is that a day trader looks for intraday signals, while longer-term traders 
format their charts for longer periods of time.
Scalping
Scalping basically means you move in and out of a position for a very limited 
profit in an extremely short time frame, usually just a few minutes or pos-
sibly only a few seconds. The scalper’s objective is to make profits of only 
fractions of a point on any given trade, rather than the several points profit 
that most traders seek. Day traders execute their trades in a much narrower 
time frame, so scalpers look for only 10 to 25 cents per share, hoping to make 
small gains as often as possible. When scalping with higher-priced ($100 
or more per share) or faster-moving stocks, one point can be considered a 
scalp.
For most stocks, scalping doesn’t pay if you trade fewer than 1,000 shares. 
Here’s why: A 10-cent scalping profit on 1,000 shares is only $100, before 
paying transaction fees or commissions. There will be little profit after fees 
and commissions if you’re trading lots with fewer than 1,000 shares.
Trend traders
Not all day traders use the scalping technique. Some are trend traders. 
Instead of jumping in and out of a trade for a fraction of a point, they look for 

281
 Chapter 17: The Basics of Day Trading
profits of at least one or two points and may stay in a position for minutes 
or even as long as an hour. Trend traders make fewer trades than scalpers, 
but seek higher profits per trade and may trade in blocks of less than 1,000 
shares, because they can make a nice profit as trend traders with consider-
ably less share volume. In fact, traders who look for more than a one-point 
profit sometimes hold a stock for several hours, unless the stock is high 
priced or its price is moving fast.
Risks Are High; Rewards Can Be Too
Reading about trading patterns and the high volume of stock trading, you’ve 
probably already figured out for yourself that the risks are high. Within a 
matter of minutes, trading in and out of stocks in 1,000-share blocks can be 
costly whenever a stock quickly moves in a direction you weren’t anticipating.
In fact, the U.S. Senate investigated the risks of day trading after a shooting 
spree at an on-site day-trading facility in Atlanta, Georgia, left nine people 
dead in July 1999. The shooter, Mark Barton, was a chemist before getting 
involved in day trading and losing $105,000 in just one month. He killed him-
self after the shooting spree.
Senate investigators found that the revenue of the 15 largest firms that 
specialize in day trading for 1999 was $541.5 million, or 276 percent higher 
than their revenue in 1997. Profits went up by more than $66 million, and by 
1999, the 15 firms had opened 12,000 new accounts. Investigators also found 
that the 4,000 to 5,000 most active traders were borrowing huge sums of 
money and losing it. In that year traders paid an average of $16 per trade and 
made an average of 29 trades per day. Using these statistics, investigators 
concluded that a trader needed to make more than $111,000 a year in stock 
market gains just to break even with that level of costs.
A second study, released in May 2004 by university professors who looked at 
day traders on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, found that 82 percent of traders 
lost money. Some may profit most days, but end up in a losing position after 
calculating costs of operations.
Liquidity
To be considered liquid, a trader must have the ability to change holdings 
quickly into cash. Although you can see that a day trader must trade a large 
number of shares to make a profit, he or she must also have significant cash 
and securities in his or her account to be able to continue trading activities.

Slippage
Slippage can cost day traders significantly if they’re not careful how they exe-
cute their trades. Slippage relates to the difference between what you expect 
your exit or entry stock prices to be and what you actually end up paying for 
and getting out of that stock when your order is finally executed. Depending 
on the volatility of the market, a stock price sometimes can vary by as much 
as one or two points from the time you see the stock quotation until the time 
your order is actually executed. Traders can control slippage with the right 
type of order. The three basic ways to enter a position are at market, with a 
stop order, or with a limit order. Day traders rarely use market orders, which 
means buying or selling a stock at the market price. Instead they use stop or 
limit orders to better control when their orders are filled and how much they 
pay for the stock. We discuss types of orders in Chapter 2.
 
Most traders recommend that you never enter a position without immediately 
placing a stop-loss order at an exit price that you decide is the most you’re 
willing to lose on a particular position. Although a stop order means that once 
a stock hits the exit price, the order changes to a market order and may result 
in your selling the stock at less than that price, it nevertheless is safer than 
placing a limit order, which can mean that you miss the exit point altogether 
and possibly lose even more. Stop-loss orders can cause some slippage, but 
you usually lose less with these types of orders than with limit orders. A limit 
order can be completely missed when your stock breaks into a downward 
trend, because the fall in price was too abrupt or rapid for it to be executed.
When buying stock, traders use limit orders, because they place limits on the 
entry prices traders are willing to pay. Traders certainly don’t want to end 
up paying higher prices than they intend, which, in turn, raises the bar for 
making a profit higher than is reasonably possible to attain.
Trading costs
Trading costs vary significantly depending on the amount of trading you do 
or don’t do each month. The minitable below provides a breakdown of the 
commissions charged by one of the top day-trading firms.
Number of Trades per Month
Commissions
1 to 399
$9.95 per trade
400 to 999
$7.95 per trade
1,000 to 1,499
$5.95 per trade
1,500 plus
$2.95 per trade

283
 Chapter 17: The Basics of Day Trading
The cost of trading is the same whether you have Level I or Level II access 
(see Chapters 3 and 14 for information on Level I and Level II quoting alterna-
tives). The number of trades you do will impact whether or not you have to 
pay for Level II access. To get Level II access for free, you must make at least 
20 trades per month; otherwise, the monthly fee for Level II access is $150. 
Options-trading fees are $9.95 per trade, plus $1.25 per contract. In addition 
to these fees, per-share charges can range from $0.002 per share to $0.01 
per share, depending on the exchange on which you choose to trade. If your 
computer crashes or your Internet access goes down, phone orders (for the 
company cited in the minitable) can cost you $15 per trade.
So if you trade 30 times a day for 20 days a month, the number of your 
trades totals 600. At $7.95 per trade, your commission costs are $4,770 per 
month, and if you trade 1,000 shares with each trade, that adds up to a total 
of 600,000 shares per month. Even at the lowest per-share exchange cost 
of $0.002, that means an additional $1,200 in per-share charges. Thus, your 
monthly cost for this volume of trading would be $5,970.
In addition to these costs, many traders also pay for newsletters or join 
trading chat rooms that give them alerts for the best opportunities each 
day. These services can add another $200 to $250 to your monthly costs. So 
before you see even one penny of profit, your monthly outlay can be $6,170 
(that’s $74,040 annually). You can easily understand why so many day trad-
ers never see a profit for at least six months and why such a high percentage 
of day traders actually give up before their businesses turn profitable.
Taxes (of course)
On top of all these costs, you must consider taxes that you’ll have to pay on 
any short-term profits at your current individual tax rate and not the pre-
ferred tax rates given to long-term investments that are held more than a year. 
However, full-time day traders have tax advantages that other traders and 
investors don’t have, but to qualify for these special breaks, day traders must:
 
✓ Buy and sell a high volume of stocks every day. If you’re day trading full 
time, proving that you’re meeting the requirements to qualify for the 
special day-trading tax breaks is easier. If you work full time and trade 
part time, qualifying for the tax break may be more difficult.
 
✓ Establish (in their accounts) that they regularly and continually make 
numerous trades just about every day the market is open. A broker 
designating you as a pattern day trader and requiring you to maintain a 
margin account minimum of $25,000 may help prove you’re a day trader 
in the eyes of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 
✓ Make a profit buying and selling stocks with short-term horizons rather 
than profit by holding stocks for long-term gains or dividend income.

284
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
If you successfully prove to the IRS that you’re a day trader, you can consider 
your day-trading activities as a business and thereby write off all your trad-
ing costs as a sole proprietor on Schedule C of your tax return. The reason 
doing so gives you such a great tax advantage is that other investors are 
able to write off only the costs that exceed 2 percent of their adjusted gross 
incomes. Any losses reported on your Schedule C business return can be 
written off against your adjusted gross income and thus reduce your tax bill, 
which, in turn, can help you qualify for other tax breaks.
In addition to the costs of making your trades, you can write off many more 
items against your business on Schedule C. You also can write off any inter-
est you pay on your margin account and possibly depreciate up to 100 per-
cent of any equipment that you bought to start and continue to run your 
trading business as a Section 179 business deduction (this deduction could 
be as much as $125,000). If you use a space in your home exclusively for your 
trading activities, you also can take a home-office deduction.
Any gains that you make on your trading activities are considered capital 
gains, and as such, are exempt from any self-employment taxes that other 
sole proprietors must pay on their business profits. You still have to report 
your gains and losses on Schedule D, and to avoid additional scrutiny, you 
may want to attach a note to your Schedule C explaining why you have losses 
and no income. The IRS red flags returns from people who report losses on 
Schedule C for several years in a row, a factor that also can trigger an audit.
Avoiding the Most Common Mistakes
If the risks and costs don’t scare you away from day trading, you need to 
become familiar with some common mistakes that lead to failure for many 
day traders. Some traders talk about their more common mistakes, especially 
the ones that cost a lot of money while they were building their businesses. 
Here are some of the more serious mistakes new day traders make:
 
✓ Breaking stop-loss rules: When a stock starts dropping, newer, not yet 
disciplined, traders tend to panic as their picks begin losing money, so 
they decide to hold the stock rather than exit when their initial stop-loss 
is reached. However, traders go broke using that strategy, because they 
don’t stop their losses as planned. You must set your exit prices based 
on your technical analysis for both losses and profits when you first buy 
the stock. Follow those rules mechanically when the target price is hit, 
and don’t let your emotions get in the way.
 
✓ Chasing trends: New traders who aren’t yet confident in the way they 
read patterns often wait to see confirmation that they’re right before 
they enter a position. That hesitation causes them to miss planned 
entry points and, if they’re right, can end up forcing them into buying 
at a stock price that’s higher than they intended when an upward 

285
 Chapter 17: The Basics of Day Trading
trend is expected or selling at a lower price than they intended when 
a downward trend is expected. By missing intended entry prices, trad-
ers end up chasing the trends and finding that their original entry and 
exit points no longer are valid because many others already acted on 
the trend and the stock is no longer available at the planned prices. 
Experienced traders just walk away from that particular trade instead of 
getting caught up in trading points that don’t match technical analysis 
and thereby chasing a trend.
 
✓ Not waiting for the right trade: A new day trader must exhibit the 
patience required in waiting for the right trade to match what the tech-
nical analysis indicates. Experienced traders know to wait for the right 
timing instead of forcing a trade, entering at the wrong price, and over-
trading their account.
 
✓ Not establishing set rules before the trading day begins: To avoid get-
ting caught up in the emotions of a big win or loss, you need to decide 
your entry and exit points before the trading day begins and never devi-
ate from them after the day begins. Experienced day traders know that 
you either focus on your trades or think about your rules. You don’t 
have time to do both, and trying to do so can be a recipe for disaster. 
Staying objective and following your rules is crucial to maintaining the 
control a day trader needs.
 
✓ Forgetting that fundamentals don’t matter: New day traders get caught 
up in the idea that the company whose stock they’ve purchased is a 
good company and that when its stock loses ground, it’s therefore 
bound to head back up. Experienced traders know that how good the 
fundamentals look doesn’t matter and that when the market is sell-
ing down, even the price of a good stock goes down. Day traders must 
follow market signs and not worry about how good or bad the funda-
mentals of the company they’re trading may appear.
 
✓ Averaging down: Although investors may average down, meaning they 
buy a stock and if the price goes down they buy even more shares 
believing that it’s a good stock that will recover, this technique doesn’t 
work at all for day traders, and most experienced traders of every 
variety will tell you that using it is a fatal mistake. Day traders instead 
believe that you need to set a stop price and get out (called stopping 
out) of a losing stock and possibly reenter again at a lower price. Doing 
so gives you time to look objectively at what is happening with the stock 
and determine whether getting back in is worthwhile. Stopping out also 
is likely to cost you less than averaging down, and you won’t risk get-
ting caught with a margin problem. Averaging down can tie up too much 
money that otherwise can be used for a more profitable trade with a dif-
ferent stock. The worst feeling, even for an experienced trader, occurs 
when a stock plunges far below the stop position, because deciding 
whether to take the large loss is difficult. In most cases, if you’re uncer-
tain of your next move, experienced traders recommend that you get 
out of the position before the situation grows worse or out of control.

286
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
 
✓ Not knowing when to take profits: New traders sometimes make the 
mistake of either taking profits too early or not taking profits at all. Both 
can result in unnecessary losses. Most of the time, indecision strikes 
when traders are afraid they’ll lose a profit if they hold it too long or 
miss a profit if they exit too soon. Just as with losses, exit points need to 
be determined before entering a position, and rules need to be followed. 
Remember that as a day trader you must focus either on your trade or 
on your rules. Day traders who move into and out of positions within 
seconds or minutes don’t have time to do both.
 
✓ Walking away from the computer with open positions: Experienced 
day traders never walk away from their computers when they still have 
an open position. Although we touch briefly on holding open positions 
overnight in the introduction to this chapter, this rule is even stricter. 
Because experienced day traders respond to price changes that occur in 
mere seconds or minutes, they definitely don’t want to be away from the 
screen while a position is still open.
 
Day trading is a high-risk career choice that you should consider only after 
doing a considerable amount of initial research, hunting down good resources 
for educating yourself about the risks and rewards, and finding all the tech-
niques you need to use to day trade successfully. Even before you get started, 
be sure to check out the firms you’re planning to use as resources by calling 
up their disciplinary records and complaint histories through the SEC or state 
regulators. You’re putting a good deal of money at risk, so take the time to find 
out all you can before spending even that first dime.
You also may want to consider taking your Series 7 exam, the exam all stock-
brokers are required to pass. Although you must be sponsored to take the 
exam, many training centers near your home or online can help you find a 
sponsoring broker. Even though you may never want to work as a broker, the 
information you’re required to know for the exam gives you a much stronger 
awareness of the securities markets and the laws by which they’re governed. 
Studying for the test, you’ll also discover more about the various investment 
products on the market and the risks you take when buying and selling each 
type. We discuss the Series 7 exam in Chapter 20. For a closer look at day 
trading, read Day Trading For Dummies by Ann C. Logue (Wiley).

In This Chapter
▶ Defining derivatives

▶ Figuring on futures
▶ Considering commodities
▶ Exploring the risks
T
raders can raise the bar on the leverage they’re allowed by opening the 
door to the derivatives markets. Derivatives are any financial instruments 
that get or derive their value from another financial security, which is called 
an underlier. This underlier is usually stocks, bonds, foreign currency, or 
commodities. The derivative buyer or seller doesn’t have to own the underly-
ing security to trade these instruments.
You may unwittingly encounter derivatives if you trade those exchange-
traded funds (ETFs) that offer to return two or even three times the value 
of an underlying stock index. Those ETFs use derivatives to amplify the 
reward — and the risk. And you may recall that derivative trading, especially 
those derivatives tied to the value of underlying mortgage assets, exacer-
bated the mortgage mess that started the financial collapse of 2008.
 
Derivatives traders use futures and options, which are the two most common 
types of derivatives, to make money in a highly risky venture. In this chapter, 
we introduce you to a variety of derivatives, how they’re traded, and the risks 
involved in trading futures and options. However, you need to seek additional 
training before jumping into this kind of trading.
Types of Derivatives: 
Futures and Options
Derivatives are marketable instruments, which over time acquire and relin-
quish value based on an underlying asset (see the later section on “Options 

288
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
lingo”), including such commodities as coffee or soybeans, bonds, and even 
stocks. They are commonly used by commercial and institutional organiza-
tions to hedge against the risks of financial losses suffered by the underlying 
assets that they hold. Buying or selling a derivative, for example, can mini-
mize your financial loss, whenever a major change occurs in the price of an 
asset that you own. Hedging is a popular tactic used by growers, producers, 
portfolio managers, and users of the commodities.
The two basic and most common types of derivatives are contracts for 
options and for futures. Traders buy and sell them as a way to speculate on 
the direction that the volatile prices of underlying assets will take farther 
down the road. If their hunches are right and the prices move in the direc-
tions they expect, traders can make a significant profit. If, on the other 
hand, they’re wrong, they can lose the amount they paid for the derivative — 
possibly even quite a bit more. Before we explain all the risks, we need to 
more accurately define futures and options.
Futures
Futures are legally binding contracts between two parties, one of whom agrees 
to buy and the other who agrees to sell an asset for a specific price at a speci-
fied time in the future. The specific price is known as the strike price. The speci-
fied date in the future is known as the settlement date. Futures first were used 
in the 18th century in Japan as a means of trading rice and silk, but they didn’t 
appear in U.S. markets until the 1850s, when futures markets were developed 
for buying and selling commodities, such as wheat, cotton, and corn.
Futures contracts are one of the most volatile trading instruments. Prices can 
change rapidly, causing traders to face sudden and sometimes huge losses 
or gains. Futures contracts are traded based on the prices of underlying com-
modities, indexes, bonds, and stocks. Most people who enter futures markets 
do so not to actually buy and sell the actual goods or underlying financial 
asset, but rather either to speculate on or to hedge the risks of the changing 
prices of the assets that they do hold.
What’s your position?
When people talk about futures, they’re bound to say something about their 
positions. Here’s what they mean:
 
✓ Short positions: The party in the contract who agrees to deliver the com-
modity, stock, or bond holds a short position. Traders who take short posi-
tions are expecting the price of the underlying commodities to go down.
 
✓ Long positions: The party in the contract who agrees to buy the com-
modity, stock, or bond in a futures contract holds a long position on the 
security. Traders who buy long positions are expecting the price of the 
underlying commodities to go up.

289
 Chapter 18: Doing It by Derivatives
Making money using futures
Traders can make money from trading futures on the basis of the daily 
movements of the markets for the various types of underlying commodities, 
stocks, bonds, or currencies involved in the contracts they buy and/or sell.
For example, typical futures contracts for wheat are signed between wheat 
farmers and bread producers. On one side of this contract, farmers agree to 
sell a specific amount of the wheat they grow at a specific price and a speci-
fied time, and on the other side, producers agree to pay that price for the 
contracted amount of wheat to be delivered to them by the specified time. 
Farmers benefit by ensuring that they can get a specific price or income from 
their wheat, and bread producers benefit by knowing how much they have to 
pay for the wheat they need to make the bread that they, in turn, sell to earn 
a living.
The value of that futures contract is adjusted daily. Assuming the farmer 
agreed in February to sell 10,000 bushels of wheat to the bread maker at $4 
per bushel in July, and assuming that before the July settlement date the 
price of wheat raises to $5 per bushel, the farmer holding the futures con-
tract has lost $1 per bushel of wheat or $10,000. These types of price adjust-
ments actually are calculated daily throughout the time that the futures 
contract is in force, and that means the farmer’s or bread maker’s account is 
credited or debited as wheat prices fluctuate.
The farmer and bread maker will probably never actually exchange their 
goods. Instead, the obligations of the futures contract eventually are settled 
with cash. In this scenario, the bread maker will probably buy his wheat at 
the current price of $5 per bushel when he needs it, but because he specu-
lated correctly on the price, it’s only really costing him $40,000 (instead of 
$50,000 at the current market price) to buy the wheat. Although the bread 
maker pays $50,000 for 10,000 bushels of wheat, he has saved $10,000 because 
of the money he made on the wheat futures contract. The farmer, on the 
other hand, sells his wheat at $5 per bushel and gets $50,000 cash, but actu-
ally keeps only $40,000, because he has to cover his loss from the futures 
contract.
You can see from this example that futures contracts are actually financial 
positions. This financial position, or the buying and selling of futures con-
tracts, is what traders are speculating about. If futures traders believe the 
price of wheat is rising, they buy futures contracts so they can benefit from 
the gain made by the price. But when the situation is reversed and the price 
of wheat drops to $3 per bushel, then the trader who buys can be on the 
losing side of that futures contract and be liable for a $10,000 loss. The cost 
of buying into a futures contract is called the premium paid for that contract, 
which is only a small percentage of the price of the actual commodity, stock, 
bond, or currency underlying the contract.

290
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Commodities futures
People who buy commodities futures basically are agreeing to buy a certain 
amount of a commodity at a set price at some point in the future. Conversely, 
people who sell those same futures are agreeing to provide a certain amount 
of a commodity at the agreed upon price by the agreed upon time. Buyers or 
sellers can enter into futures contracts on many commodities, including farm 
products (pork bellies, wheat, corn, and soybeans), precious metals (gold, 
copper, and silver), and many others.
Traders usually don’t get directly involved as buyers and sellers of the actual 
commodities, because they usually get out of their futures contracts before 
the underlying commodities upon which their trades are based ever change 
hands. Instead, they’re speculators, buying and/or selling futures contracts 
based on which way they think the commodity price is going to move. 
Speculation, as you know, is wrought with risk, and the reason the risk is so 
great is that a commodity contract controls a large amount of the commodity 
(or commodity value) compared with the relatively small price that it takes 
to buy or sell the contract. The result is extensive leverage, which means 
controlling a large position with only a small cash deposit. If the price moves 
in a direction that’s the opposite of what the trader anticipates, he or she 
may have to take a huge loss to get out of the contract.
Index futures
Index futures are based on the expected direction of the value of indexes like 
the S&P 500 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite indexes. They can 
be the riskiest types of futures. No underlying commodities, stocks, or bonds 
ever change hands with these futures contracts. Any differences in these con-
tracts must be settled with good old, cold hard cash. Leverage also is high on 
these types of futures. For example, a Dow Jones Industrial Average contract 
has a value that’s 25 times the value of the underlying DJIA Index.
Smaller index futures contracts, known collectively as e-minis, are targeted 
at individual traders. These minicontracts are available for indexes such as 
the S&P 500, the NASDAQ 100, the S&P mid-cap, and the Russell 2000. Their 
respective individual values range from 20 times to 100 times those of the 
underlying indexes.
The S&P 500 e-mini contract, for example, is 50 times the value of the S&P 500 
index. In other words, if a trader takes a position in the S&P 500 e-mini con-
tract, every time the underlying S&P 500 index moves one point, the value of 
the S&P 500 e-mini contract changes by $50. Another way to think about this 
is for every .25 point, the value of the S&P 500 e-mini contract changes by 
50 cents. If you take a long position in the S&P 500 e-mini contract when the 
underlying index is at 1,000, and the index moves to 1,010, you have a $500 

291
 Chapter 18: Doing It by Derivatives
profit. The trader who took the other side of this trade, the short position, is 
in exactly the opposite position, losing $500.
Bond futures
Bond futures are based on the price of future delivery of a specific type of 
bond in a specific denomination at a specific interest rate on a specified date. 
Speculators basically are betting on whether the price of that bond goes up 
or down. Changes in interest rates have a big impact on the values of bonds. 
In general, when interest rates fall, bond prices go up, and when interest 
rates rise, bond prices go down. Speculators in bond futures basically enter 
positions based on whether interest rates will go up or down. For example, a 
speculator who thinks interest rates will go up sells contracts for the future 
delivery of bonds. If interest rates, indeed, go up as expected, the price for 
the underlying bonds goes down, and speculators can do one of two things:
 
✓ Buy the lower-priced bonds, and, in turn, earn a profit by selling them 
to the buyer to settle at the higher price named in the original futures 
contract.
 
✓ Close the contract to realize a profit.
Stock futures
Stock futures are contracts in which you agree to either deliver or purchase 
upon delivery 100 shares of a particular stock on or before a designated date 
in the future (known as the expiration date). For example, a trader who enters 
into a contract to buy 100 shares at $30 a share for a total of $3,000, and who 
expects the price of that stock to go up, can lock in the lower price and then 
buy the actual stock at that lower price on the settlement date or close the 
contract and realize a profit. Traders who enter into this type of contract 
generally must have about 20 percent of the cash value of 100 shares of the 
underlying stock in their brokerage accounts, so a trader in the earlier exam-
ple would have to have $300 in a brokerage account.
Foreign currency futures
Future currency contracts are contracts that involve the future delivery of 
certain foreign currencies. We discuss these types of futures in Chapter 19.
 
Yes, futures contracts are riskier than options, because you actually have to 
come up with the underlying commodity, bond, stock, or currency to satisfy 
the contract, sell the future at a loss before the settlement date, or pay the 
difference in cash to settle the contract. Futures are binding contracts that 
require you to fulfill the obligations specified in the contracts. Options are less 
risky because they’re not an obligation to perform. Rather, they instead give 
the buyer of the option the right to exercise the option, but the buyer is not 
obligated to do so.

292
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Options
Although futures have been available in the United States since the 1850s, 
options did not become available until 1982, when they were part of a gov-
ernment pilot program. The big advantage that options have over futures is 
that you buy the right to exercise the option contract, and yet you still can 
decide to allow the option to expire without ever exercising that right. When 
you let an option expire, you lose only the amount you paid for the option 
and not the full amount that otherwise can be lost in trading the underlying 
asset. Option sellers take the riskier stance, because they can lose the value 
of whatever asset they promised to sell or buy if the option buyer decides to 
exercise the option.
Options are financial instruments that give the buyer the right, but not the 
obligation, to buy or sell a particular asset at a predetermined date in the 
future at a specified price.
Options lingo
Trading in options has a language all its own, and you’ll need to understand it 
before we get into the mechanics, so here are some key terms:
 
✓ Puts: A put option is a contract that gives the buyer the right to sell a 
particular asset at a specified price at any time during the life of the 
option.
 
✓ Calls: A call option is a contract that gives the buyer the right to buy 
a particular asset at a specified price at any time during the life of the 
option.
 
✓ Option grantor: The person who writes or sells any option is called the 
option grantor. This person or financial entity must come up with the 
underlying asset promised in the option, even if doing so means a loss, 
whenever an option buyer decides to exercise an option. For example, if 
an option grantor agrees to sell you 100 shares of ABC stock for $50 per 
share on or before May 1, and the stock price rises to $60 on April 20, 
then the grantor must sell you that stock for $50 and take the $10-per-
share loss. You get to sell ABC at the current price and reap the benefits.
 
✓ Covered calls: If an option seller holds an equivalent position, or owns 
the same number of shares of the underlying asset that is offered in the 
call, then the contract is considered a covered call. Options traders sell-
ing covered calls are trying to take advantage of a neutral or declining 
stock. If the option expires unexercised, the writer (seller) of the option 
keeps the premium. If, on the other hand, the holder (buyer) of the 
option exercises it, the stock must be delivered. However, because the 
option writer already owns the stock, the risk is limited. The opposite 

293
 Chapter 18: Doing It by Derivatives
scenario is an uncovered call, which is when the writer sells a call for 
a stock that he or she doesn’t own. The seller of an uncovered call is 
taking virtually unlimited risk.
 
✓ Covered puts: When the seller of a put option also has sold short an 
equivalent amount in the underlying security, then this option is consid-
ered a covered put. If the writer has neither established a short position 
in the underlying security nor deposited a corresponding amount of 
cash equal to the value of the put, then the put is called a naked put. The 
seller of a naked put also is taking virtually unlimited risk.
 
✓ Option holder: The person who buys the option is called the option 
holder. If the option buyer buys the right to sell an asset at some time 
in the future, then he or she buys a put option. If the option buyer buys 
the right to purchase an asset at some time in the future, then he or she 
buys a call option. The most an option holder can lose is the amount 
paid for the option contract.
 
✓ Underlying asset: An option contract is based on an underlying asset — 
usually either a futures contract or specific number of shares of stock — 
that can be bought or sold.
 
✓ Premium: The actual price paid for the option is called the premium, 
which is what the option holder pays to the option grantor to gain the 
right to either buy or sell the underlying asset. Premiums for options are 
set by the open market. Option buyers must pay the premium plus what-
ever fees their brokers charge for such transactions.
 
✓ Expiration date: The expiration date is the last day that an option buyer 
can exercise the rights specified in the contract. Options based on 
futures contracts usually expire one month before the settlement date 
of the underlying futures contract. After an option expires, the option 
holder no longer has any rights and the option has no value. So option 
buyers lose whatever premium they paid plus any commissions or trans-
action costs that had to be paid when the option was purchased. In that 
case, the option is said to expire worthless.
 
✓ Exercise: Option buyers can exercise the rights they purchase with the 
option any time before the expiration date, if, that is, the option they 
purchased is an American-style option. European-style options, on the 
other hand, can be exercised only on their expiration dates. Exercising 
a call option means the option buyer buys the underlying asset at the 
price set in the option regardless of the current market price for the 
asset. Exercising a put option means the option buyer sells the under-
lying asset at the price set in the option. An option buyer can always 
decide not to exercise the rights set forth in his or her option and simply 
let it expire. The option holder also can sell the option contract at its 
current market value.

294

✓ Strike price: The strike price is the price of the underlying asset at which 
the option can be exercised.
 
✓ Offset: If option buyers or sellers want to realize their profits or limit 
their losses, they can offset their option through a sale or purchase 
that also is called liquidating an option or closing an option. When an 
option is liquidated, no position is actually taken in the underlying asset. 
Offsetting is usually done on the same exchange where the buyer first 
bought or sold the option. If they can sell the option for more than they 
bought it, then they will realize a profit. If they sell the option for less 
than they paid, then they will take a loss.
 
✓ In-the-money: An option is said to be in-the-money when it is worthwhile 
to exercise the option and buy or sell the underlying asset. A call option 
is in-the-money when the market price for the underlying asset is above 
the strike price set in the option contract. A put option is in-the-money 
when the price for the underlying asset is lower than the strike price set 
in the option contract.
 
✓ At-the-money: An option is deemed to be at-the-money when the strike 
price for the option is the same as the market price for the underlying 
asset.
 
✓ Out-of-the-money: An option is said to be out-of-the-money when it’s not 
worthwhile to exercise the option. A call option is out-of-the-money 
when the strike price is higher than the market price for the underlying 
asset. A put option is out-of-the-money when the strike price is less than 
the market price for the underlying asset.
Option pricing
The three factors affecting the price of an option premium are as follows:
 
✓ Date of expiration: As the option moves closer to its date of expiration, 
the value of the option declines, and that’s why an option is considered 
a wasting asset. The more time that you have until an option expires, the 
greater possibility you have for the option to reach the point of being in-
the-money. Longer options therefore have higher premiums.
 
✓ Strike price: For out-of-the-money options, when the current market 
price moves more and more out-of-the-money and away from the strike 
price, the premium price gets lower and lower. The premium for an 
in-the-money option, on the other hand, rises in value if the underlying 
asset moves further into the money in relationship to the strike price.
 
✓ Volatility: The more volatility that’s in the market for the underlying 
asset, or stock, the greater the chance that the option will become 
worthwhile to exercise. When the market for an asset is volatile, premi-
ums for options on that asset are higher.
Option-pricing techniques are considered to be among the most mathemati-
cally complex of all applied areas of finance. One common example, the 

295
 Chapter 18: Doing It by Derivatives
Black-Scholes option-pricing model (named for its developers Fischer Black 
and Myron Scholes), takes into consideration the stock’s price, the option’s 
strike price and expiration date, the risk-free return, and the standard devia-
tion of the stock’s return, which are all measures of volatility.
When you get a quote for an option, you may have to choose from numerous 
strike prices and expiration dates that are available. When you’re thinking 
about buying a call option, and its strike price is low and yet close to becoming 
worthwhile to exercise, the premium price (the price you pay for the option) 
will be much higher than for an option with a higher strike price. If you’re 
thinking about buying a put option, then you’ll pay more of a premium for an 
option with a high strike price than you will for one with a lower strike price.
Just to give you an idea of how the pricing of options is affected by strike 
price and time, Table 18-1 is an options quote for an imaginary stock we call 
ABC. Settle is the time of expiration for the option.

You can see from the options quotes for ABC stock that a May call with a 
strike price of $54 commands a premium of $2.60 per share. To buy an option 
for 100 shares, the premium would be $260 plus whatever fees your exchange 
or broker charges. Buying a call is much less of a cash outlay than if you 
were to buy 100 shares of ABC stock at $54. That would cost you $5,400. The 
premium of $260 is paid to the option seller, minus any fees charged by the 
broker or exchange.
Fees include commission charges plus any costs involved in executing the 
order on the trading floor of the exchange. Commissions vary greatly from 
broker to broker, so be certain you understand all the possible fees before 
initiating a trade. Some brokers charge commissions per trade, but others 
charge on the basis of a round trip, including both the purchase and the sale 
of the option. Some brokerage firms charge per-option transaction fees, while 
others charge on the basis of a percentage of the option premium that’s usu-
ally subject to a minimum charge.

296
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
 
Commission charges can have a major impact on whether you’re able to earn 
a profit or have to suffer a loss on an option. A high commission charge 
reduces your potential for making a profit and can even drive what little profit 
you make into a loss. So be careful. Know what charges you have to pay and 
compare them with other brokers before you trade.
Options and futures are quoted with bid and ask prices just like stocks, 
and the spreads with options can grow pretty wide as a percentage of the 
option’s premium, which, in turn, can have a significant impact on the prof-
itability of your option position. The wider the spread, the harder it is for 
you to make a profit. As an option trader, you typically buy at the ask, the 
higher price, and sell at the bid, the lower price. That means that any trade 
must recover the difference between the bid and the ask before you can earn 
a profit. As with stock trading, you can use a limit order to put your order 
between the bid and the ask, but there is no guarantee that your order will be 
filled. See Chapter 14 for more about bid-ask spreads.
Buying Options and Futures Contracts
All types of options and futures are traded on a commodities exchange. In 
addition, some types of options can be traded on stock exchanges. The NYSE 
Alternext U.S. (formerly the American Stock Exchange, or Amex) trades stock 
options, index options, and options on exchange-traded funds. The NASDAQ 
OMX trades the index and currency options that used to trade on the 
Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) 
handles stock and several specialized futures options. You can trade stock 
options and some index options in a traditional stock account. Special risk 
release forms must be signed, but otherwise, the account remains the same. 
(For more about establishing an account, see Chapter 3.) Covered options 
and naked short positions require a margin account.
Opening an account
If you want to buy futures or options on futures, you must do so through 
an individual account that you open with a registered futures commission 
merchant (FCM) or through your broker. Your broker transmits any transac-
tions through an FCM as an introducing broker. Your broker won’t collect the 
funds from you for your options trades. You have to deposit them directly 
with the FCM.

297
 Chapter 18: Doing It by Derivatives
You have the choice of opening either a discretionary account or a nondis-
cretionary account. A discretionary account is an account in which you sign a 
power of attorney over to either your FCM, your broker, or a commodity trad-
ing advisor (CTA) so he or she can make trading decisions on your behalf. A 
nondiscretionary account is an account in which you make all the trading deci-
sions. You also may want to consider trading through a commodity pool. When 
trading through a commodity pool, you purchase a share or interest in a pool 
of other investors, and trades are executed by an FCM or CTA. Any profits or 
losses are shared proportionately by the members of the pool.
When you open an individual account, you need to make a deposit that 
amounts to a margin payment or performance bond for the options or futures 
you trade. This payment is relatively small compared to the size of your 
potential market position, and it gives you the opportunity to greatly lever-
age your money. Small changes in options and futures prices can result in 
large gains or large losses in relatively short periods of time.
Your broker calculates the values of the futures and option contracts in 
your account on a daily basis, and you need to maintain a margin level that’s 
approximately 75 percent of the amount required when you originally enter 
your positions. If your holdings fall below that level, you’ll be asked to come 
up with the cash to restore your margin account to the initial level, a situa-
tion that’s known as a margin call. If you can’t meet the margin call in a rea-
sonable period of time, which can be as little as an hour, your brokerage firm 
closes out enough of your positions to reduce your margin deficiency. If your 
positions are liquidated at a loss, you can be held liable for that loss, which 
sometimes can be substantially more than your original margin deposit.
Calculating the price and making a buy
Before buying an option, you first must calculate the break-even price, but 
you must know the option’s strike price, the premium cost, and the commis-
sion or other transaction costs to be able to do it. With those three details 
in hand, you can determine a break-even price for a call option using this 
formula:
Option strike price + option premium costs + commission and 
transaction fees = break-even price
Using the example in Table 18-1, here is the per-share break-even price for 
buying a May call option with a strike price of $54 and a commission of $25, 
or 25 cents per share:
$54 + $2.60 + $0.25 = $56.85

298
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
To make a profit on this call option, the stock price of ABC has to rise above 
$56.85. If the stock price doesn’t rise above $56.85, you won’t make a profit 
on this option purchase (unless you’re somehow able to sell the option for 
more than $2.85 before the expiration date — see the next section). These 
calculations are correct only when your broker has one fee for a round-
trip option exchange. If you have to pay fees in both directions, which is 
common, then you need to double the fee in the calculation. Most brokers do 
charge fees in both directions. The fees are the same in each direction, so the 
cost for trading would be double.
When calculating the break-even price for a put option, you subtract the pre-
mium, commission, and transaction costs. Here is the break-even calculation 
for a May put option for ABC stock at a strike price of $54 with a commission 
of $25, or 25 cents per share:
$54 – $2.00 – 25 cents = $51.75
In this scenario, ABC stock has to drop below $51.75 for this put option to be 
worthwhile.
If you’re expecting a stock price increase, you want to consider purchasing 
a call option, but if you expect a price decline, you want to consider pur-
chasing a put option. In both scenarios, you need to check the fundamental 
and technical analyses information you gathered on the underlying stock or 
asset, so you can be certain that any break-even prices you’ve calculated rea-
sonably match what your analysis indicates.
Options for Getting Out of Options
After you buy an option, you have to decide how you want to opt out of that 
position. You can choose one of the following three alternatives:
 
✓ Offset the option.
 
✓ Continue holding the option.
 
✓ Exercise the option.
Offsetting the option
You offset an option by liquidating your option position, usually in the same 
marketplace that you bought the option. If you want to get out of an option 
before its expiration date, you can try to sell it for whatever price you can 

299
 Chapter 18: Doing It by Derivatives
get. Doing so either enables you to take your profits or reduces your poten-
tial loss by the amount you receive for the option. As long as you bought 
your option in an active market, other investors usually are willing to pay for 
the rights your option conveys. The key, of course, is how much they’re will-
ing to pay.
Your net profit or loss for this option is determined by the difference between 
what you originally pay in premiums, commissions, and other transaction 
costs minus the premium you receive when you liquidate the option after 
deducting commissions and other transaction costs.
Holding the option
If your option is not yet in-the-money, but you still believe it may get there, 
you can continue to hold the option until the exercise date. If you’re right, 
you can exercise the option before the expiration date or liquidate at a later 
date, which means to buy or sell the option before the expiration date at 
some time in the future. If you’re wrong, you risk the possibility that you 
won’t find a buyer or that you’ll have to let the option expire and take a loss 
that is equal to the amount of the premium, commission, and transaction 
costs you paid. Some traders take an even more risky position by buying 
options that are deeply out-of-the-money for just pennies a share. Even if 
these options never grow any nearer to being in-the-money, as long as they 
move in the right direction, the premiums will rise. Although we don’t recom-
mend using this strategy, profits can be made as long as you’re able to sell 
the option before its expiration date.
 
Options decline in value as they get closer to their expiration dates, so if you 
think you’ve made a mistake and the market moves against your position, bite 
the bullet as soon as possible and try to liquidate your option to minimize 
your losses.
Exercising the option
You can exercise an option any time prior to its expiration date, as long as 
you’re trading in American-style options. You don’t have to wait until the 
exercise date to exercise an American-style option. (Some option contracts 
sold in the United States are European-style, which can be exercised only on 
the expiration date.) Exercising an option means:
 
✓ Buying the underlying asset when you own a call
 
✓ Selling the underlying asset when you own a put

300
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
In general, call options are exercised only when the trader plans to hold the 
underlying asset, and put options are exercised only when the trader owns 
the underlying asset and wants to sell it. Option traders are more likely to 
realize any gains or losses by closing their option positions rather than exer-
cising them.
The Risks of Trading Options and Futures
Trading in options and futures is risky business, and regulations govern-
ing those trades are stringent, even with regard to allowing you to open an 
account. Before opening an account for you, a broker must provide you with 
a disclosure document that describes the risks involved in trading futures 
and options contracts. The document gives you the opportunity to deter-
mine whether you have the experience and financial resources necessary to 
engage in option trading and whether option trading is appropriate for meet-
ing your goals and objectives.
Topics that must be covered in the disclosure statement include the risks 
inherent in trading futures contracts or options and the effect that leveraging 
your account can have on potential losses or gains. The statement also must 
include warnings about trading futures in foreign markets, because those 
types of trades carry additional risks from fluctuations in currency exchange 
rates and differences in regulatory protection.
Commodities options and futures also can be risky, because many of the fac-
tors that affect their prices are totally unpredictable, such as the weather, 
labor strikes, inflation, foreign exchange rates, and governmental policies. 
Because positions in futures and options are so highly leveraged, even a 
small price movement against your position can result in at least the loss of 
your entire premium payment and possibly even much greater liability for 
additional losses.
 
After you begin trading options and futures, you can’t close your account 
until all open positions are closed, if, that is, you’re trading through an 
account with a commodities exchange. This restriction does not apply to 
options traded in a stock brokerage account. Any accruals on futures con-
tracts are paid out daily. Any funds in your margin account that are beyond 
your required margin or account-opening requirements can be withdrawn, 
but other such funds have to remain in the account until all your positions 
are closed. Any restrictions on the withdrawal of your funds are stated in the 
original disclosure document. Be sure that you understand those restrictions 
before committing your funds.

301
 Chapter 18: Doing It by Derivatives
After opening your account, your broker usually mails or emails confirmation 
of all purchases and sales, a month-end summary of transactions that show 
any gains or losses, and an evaluation of your open positions and current 
account values. You need to be able to get information from your broker on a 
daily basis after you begin to trade.
Brokers are required to segregate any money you deposit in your account 
from the brokerages’ own funds. The amount that is segregated either 
increases or decreases depending on the success of your trades. Even if the 
brokerage firm segregates your funds, you still may not be able to get all your 
money back if the brokerage firm becomes insolvent and is unable to cover 
all the obligations to its customers. In other words, the money you put into 
your brokerage account is not insured.
Whenever problems with your broker arise and you can’t resolve them with-
out help, you have several dispute-resolution options. You can contact the 
reparations program of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) 
and ask for an industry-sponsored arbitration, or you can take your broker to 
court. Before deciding how you want to proceed, you must consider the costs 
involved with each option, the length of time it may take to resolve the prob-
lem, and whether you want to contact an attorney. You can get more informa-
tion about dispute-resolution alternatives by contacting the CFTC at www.
cftc.gov/customerprotection/redressandreparations/index.htm, 
or by calling 202-418-5250.
Minimizing Risks
In a nutshell, the best way to minimize the risks of derivatives trading is 
to take the time to find out as much as you can about the inherent risks of 
the derivatives you’re trading and how others have dealt with them. The 
first step you can take is to check out the firms or individuals with whom 
you plan to trade. All firms and individuals that offer to trade options or 
futures must be registered with the CFTC (www.cftc.gov) and be mem-
bers of the National Futures Association (NFA — www.nfa.futures.org). 
You can check out firms and individuals online at the NFA site by using its 
Background Affiliation Status Information Center (BASIC). On BASIC, you’ll 
find the status of the firm or individual and any disciplinary actions taken by 
the NFA, the CFTC, or any U.S. exchanges.
Next be sure that you’re familiar with the firm’s commission charges and how 
they’re calculated. Compare one firm’s quotes with those of other firm you’re 
considering. Whenever a firm has unusually high commission charges, ask 
for a detailed explanation for the higher charges and what additional services 
justify the higher cost.

302
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Always make sure that you calculate the break-even price for any option 
you’re thinking about purchasing, because you have to know at what point 
the option you’re planning to buy will be profitable and whether the data 
you’ve collected justifies the option’s premium costs.
You also need to understand the market for the underlying asset of the 
option or future you plan to buy and what can impact the market price of 
that asset. Be sure that your expectations for the potential profits from the 
option or futures contract you choose are reasonable.
You don’t ever want to buy an option without first coming to a full realization 
that you can lose the entire value of your trade. If you want to take the riskier 
position as an option writer, be sure you can accept the possibility that your 
losses may exceed the premium you initially received for the option. Option 
writing comes with the potential of unlimited losses, as does futures trading.
Just as with stock trading, you can limit your losses by carefully setting your 
risk limits before you start to trade. Don’t let yourself get caught up in the 
emotions of futures and options trading. Develop a plan before you buy that 
first option or future and stick with that plan, and be sure to diversify your 
holdings not only by asset types but also by time of expiration.
 
After you determine how much capital you want to put into trading deriva-
tives, make sure that you know how much you can afford to lose on just one 
trade to be able to stay in business. You don’t want to overexpose your cash 
position on one trade and risk the possibility that you won’t have the money 
you need when the next opportunity comes along. By exposing your capital to 
a variety of markets, you also have a better chance that some of your trades 
will end up succeeding — how bad can that be?
Be wary of firms that lead you to believe you can make lots of money trad-
ing options or futures with very little risk. That’s never true. If a firm is using 
high-pressure tactics to get you to trade, that’s a sure sign of a problem, so 
don’t allow yourself to be rushed into a trading decision. If you aren’t being 
given enough time to construct your own fundamental and technical analyses 
before you make a purchase, walk away from the deal.
The risks associated with trading futures and options can be more than you 
initially paid for the trade, so be careful out there! We’ve given you an over-
view of the options and futures trading arena, but before you jump in, be sure 
you get significantly more training.

T
rading money in the global markets can be a great way to make more of 
it, but beware that it also can be a lesson in how to lose money quickly. 
More than $4 trillion is traded every month on the foreign currency exchange 
(Forex), and yet no centralized headquarters or formal regulatory body exists 
for this form of trade. London is the main trading center, but New York, 
Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Singapore are important trading centers as well.
Foreign currency exchange is regulated through a patchwork of international 
agreements between countries, most of which have some type of regulatory 
agency that controls what goes on within their respective borders. Thus, the 
foreign currency exchange actually is a worldwide network of traders who 
are connected by telephone and computer screens.
Although more international policing of money trading has occurred in 
recent years, authorities have had some successes exposing scams and 
frauds that victimize traders, especially newer ones. So if you want to try 
this wild world of trading, you need to be wary and not depend entirely on 
what we discuss here in this chapter. Sure, we explain the workings of foreign 
exchange markets and how the language of the Forex and its risks are unique, 
but you need to do a whole bunch more training before you ever consider 
entering this extremely risky trading arena.

Exploring the World of Foreign 
Currency Exchange
If you’ve ever traveled outside the United States, you’ve probably traded in 
a foreign currency. Every time you travel outside your home country, you 
have to exchange your country’s currency for the currency used in the coun-
try you’re visiting. If you’re a U.S. citizen shopping in England, and you see a 
sweater that you want for £100 (100 pounds — the pound is the name of the 
basic unit of currency in Great Britain), you’d need to know the exchange 
rate. In January 2008, for example, the rate was $1.4515 U.S. for £1 (one 
pound). So a £100 sweater would cost you $145.15 in U.S. dollars.
We include this example here to show you how foreign currency exchange 
is used by the average shopper, but foreign currency traders trade much 
larger sums of money thousands of times a day. The majority of trades take 
place in three main centers of currency trading — the United States, the 
United Kingdom, and Japan. The rest of the trading takes place primarily 
in Singapore, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Germany, France, and Australia. The 
United Kingdom manages the largest share — about 32 percent. The United 
States is second with 18 percent, and Japan is third with 8 percent.
 
Currency trading is ongoing, 24 hours a day, with some countries just getting 
started as others are finishing up their business day. For example, when the 
trading day opens at 8 a.m. in London, the trading day is ending for Singapore 
and Hong Kong. When New York opens its trading doors, it’s already 1 p.m. in 
London. Thus, traders must be alert around the clock, because a major event 
at an off hour anywhere in the world can shake the markets at any time.
Individual trades in the range of $200 million to $500 million are not uncom-
mon. In fact, the U.S. Federal Reserve estimates that approximately $3.2 tril-
lion dollars are traded every month. In fact, estimates indicate that quoted 
price changes occur as frequently as 20 times per minute, and the most 
active currency rates can change as many as 18,000 times in a single day, 
according to the Federal Reserve.
Types of currency traders
Traders can be grouped into one of four basic types — bankers, brokers, cus-
tomers, and central banks. Each plays a different role in the foreign currency 
exchange market.

305
 Chapter 19: Going Foreign (Forex)
 
✓ Bankers, banks, and other financial institutions do the lion’s share of 
trading. They make profits buying and selling currency to each other. 
Approximately two-thirds of all Forex transactions involve banks dealing 
directly with each other.
 
✓ Brokers or dealers sometimes act as intermediaries between the banks, 
helping them, or other traders looking for a good deal, find out where 
they can get the best currency trade. Buyers and sellers like work-
ing through brokers or dealers, because they can trade anonymously 
through intermediaries. Brokers make profits on currency exchanges by 
charging a commission for the transactions they arrange.
 
✓ Customers, which primarily are major companies, trade currency so 
they can operate globally or invest internationally. For example, if a U.S. 
car manufacturer buys parts from a manufacturer in Japan, then the U.S. 
car manufacturer needs to buy and pay for the parts in Japanese yen. 
Companies that trade currencies regularly have their own trading desks, 
while others conduct their currency trading through brokers or banks.
 
✓ Central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, that act on behalf of their 
governments, sometimes participate in the Forex market to influence the 
value of the currencies of their respective countries. For example, if the 
Federal Reserve believes the dollar is weak, it may buy dollars and even 
encourage central banks of other countries to do the same in the Forex 
market, to boost, or increase, the value of the dollar.
Why currency changes in value
Among the many factors that impact the value of a nation’s currency are
 
✓ Business cycles
 
✓ Political developments
 
✓ Changes in tax laws
 
✓ Stock market news
 
✓ Inflationary expectations
 
✓ International investment patterns
 
✓ Policies adopted by governments and central banks
Traders must monitor all these potential factors so they can stay on top of 
political or economic changes that impact the value of the currencies they 
hold. Currency trading, like other forms of trading, is affected by the basic 
economic principle of supply and demand. When a whole bunch of one type 
of currency is available for sale, the market can be flooded with it, and the 

306
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
price of that currency drops. When the supply of currency is low and the 
demand for it is high, then the value of that currency rises. Governments 
influence the value of their respective currencies by flooding the market 
whenever they want the value to fall or making the supply scarce (by buying 
their own currency) whenever they want the value of their currencies to rise.
What traders do
Currency traders look for a currency that offers the highest return with the 
lowest risk. For example, if a nation’s financial instruments, such as stocks 
and bonds, offer high rates of return with relatively low risk, then traders 
who are foreign to that nation want to buy that currency, thus increasing 
the demand. Currency is also in demand when its country is going through a 
growth segment in its business cycle highlighted by stable prices and a wide 
range of goods and services available for sale. Forex traders who speculate 
on the values of currencies to earn their keep look for specific signs to indi-
cate when exchange rates may change, including the following:
 
✓ Political instability: Unrest in a country drives up demand for currency 
in safer markets, such as U.S. dollars, as speculators race to find safe 
havens.
 
✓ Rising interest rates: Higher interest rates encourage foreign invest-
ments in countries where native investors are seeking better rates of 
return than they can get at home.
 
✓ Economic reforms: Economic reforms in developing countries may 
help improve their currencies. As a result, investors see new opportu-
nities for investing in the currencies of those successfully developing 
countries.
Traders try to predict these moves in advance, so they can get in or out of 
a currency before others. Correctly guessing where a currency is going and 
taking a position in that currency at the beginning of the trend can mean 
huge profits for a trader. Traders make money either by buying the currency 
at a lower price and then selling it later at a higher price or by selling their 
holdings in currencies of other countries at higher prices before they have 
time to react negatively to improvements in the first currency. After the mar-
kets for their original holdings fall, they simply reestablish positions in them 
at bargain prices.
 
When a trader purchases a large amount of a particular currency, then he or 
she is long on the currency. Conversely, when a trader sells a large amount of a 
currency, then he or she is short on the currency.

307
 Chapter 19: Going Foreign (Forex)
The Forex market is dominated by four currencies, which account for 80 
percent of the market — the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and 
the British pound. These currencies always are liquid, which makes finding 
someone willing to buy or sell any of them easy for traders. Other currencies 
are not as liquid, and as is true with the stocks of small companies, you’re 
sometimes unable to find any buyers or sellers when you’re ready to trade 
for the currency of a smaller country. Currencies of developing countries are 
softest, usually facing lower demand than the currencies of developed coun-
tries. Soft currencies at times can be difficult to convert.
Understanding Money Jargon
The world of foreign currency exchange has a unique language of its own. 
Prices are quoted two ways, meaning that when one trader talks price with 
another, they state their respective prices in terms of what exchange rate 
they’ll pay to buy it and what they’ll take when selling it. Bid and ask price 
differences, or spreads, usually are stated in pips or hundredths of a currency 
unit. Spreads normally are no more than ten pips.
Pips are the smallest incremental price movement permitted in the currency 
market. Although most transactions deal in thousands or millions of dollars, 
yen, euro, or other currencies, and a one-cent spread can equal thousands of 
dollars, most currency price quotes nevertheless are extended out four deci-
mals (1.5432, for example). Many times traders quote only the last two digits, 
or the small numbers, such as 32 exchange for 22, because the incremental 
changes are so small only the last two digits matter.
As a trader, you need to think in terms of the host currency when receiv-
ing a quote for direct exchange, which would be an exchange based on the 
value of the host country’s currency. For example, quotes given to traders 
on the CME Group (formerly three separate exchanges: Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, and NYMEX) are based on the U.S. dollar, 
because it’s the host currency for the CME Group. You can see how that 
exchange works at www.cmegroup.com. Quotes for indirect exchange are 
just the opposite. They’re based on the foreign currency for which you are 
seeking a trade rather than on the host currency. For example, if you’re in 
the United States and receive an indirect price quote, you’d be getting a 
price based on buying a set amount of foreign currency in exchange for U.S. 
dollars. Most exchanges take place on the interbank market — currency 
exchanges among the world’s banks — and are based on the U.S. dollar. The 
one exception to the rule is the British pound sterling.

308
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
Traders use three different types of trades to exchange currency. They’re 
known as spot, forward, and option transactions.
Spot transactions
Spot transactions account for about a third of all Forex transactions and 
involve trades in which two traders agree on an exchange rate and then trade 
currencies based on that rate. These transactions usually start with one 
trader calling another and asking for a price on a particular type of currency 
without specifying whether he or she wants to buy or sell. The trader on the 
receiving end of the call gives the caller a two-way price — one if he or she 
wants to buy and the other one if he or she wants to sell. If they agree to do 
business, the two exchange their respective currencies.
Forward transactions
Forward transactions are used when traders want to buy or sell currency at 
some agreed-upon date in the future. A buyer and a seller set an exchange 
rate for the transaction, and the transaction occurs at the set price at the 
appointed time regardless of what the current market price is for the curren-
cies. Forward transactions can be only a few days or even years in the future, 
although most futures contracts are for 30, 60, or 90 days. The two types of 
forward transactions are futures and swaps.
 
✓ Futures: Futures are forward transactions that have standard contract 
sizes and maturity dates. These types of transactions are traded on an 
exchange set up for this purpose.
 
✓ Swaps: A swap, the more common type of forward transaction, is a pri-
vate contract through which two parties exchange currencies for a spe-
cific length of time and then agree to reverse the transaction at a later 
date, which is set at the time of the initial contract.
The risk that traders take in using forward transactions is that market rates 
can change, turning the contract to which they’ve just agreed into a losing 
trade. They still have to fulfill the contract at the fixed price, because after 
the contract is signed the price cannot be revised.
Companies that place orders for products from foreign firms usually use this 
type of transaction so they can lock in an exchange rate at some time in the 
future when their orders are ready. Companies placing these orders don’t 
want to lay out the cash upfront to exchange currencies, but they neverthe-
less want to be able to budget set amounts for their purchases. As such, 

309
 Chapter 19: Going Foreign (Forex)
they’d rather risk missing a better rate for the currency exchange in the 
future than a major shift in the price of the product (perhaps brought on by 
a currency shock) that’s going to end up costing them much more than they 
intended to pay.
Options
Option contracts were added to the Forex world to give traders a bit more 
flexibility than a forward transaction affords them. Like forward transactions, 
the owner of an option contract has the right to either buy or sell a specified 
amount of foreign currency at a specified rate up to a specified date. The big 
difference with option contracts is that traders who hold a contract are not 
obligated to fulfill the transaction. They can, instead, simply decide to let it 
expire.
Option buyers have to pay for the right to buy or sell these transactions 
on or before a specified date. The set price at which the currencies are 
exchanged is called the strike price. When the date for the exchange arrives, 
the option holder determines whether the strike price is favorable. If it is, 
the option owner completes the transaction and earns a profit, but if it isn’t 
favorable, the option owner allows the option to expire and absorbs the 
cost of purchasing the original option, which is less of a loss than actually 
exchanging the currencies. The two types of options currency traders deal 
with are
 
✓ Call options, which are options to buy currency at some set price in the 
future
 
✓ Put options, which are options to sell currency at some set price in the 
future
For example, suppose a trader purchases a six-month call option on one mil-
lion euros at an exchange rate of 1.39 U.S. dollars to the euro. During that six-
month period, the trader can (has the option to) either purchase the euros at 
the $1.39 rate, buy them at market rate, or do nothing at all. As market rates 
for currencies fluctuate, options in those currencies can be sold and resold 
many times before the expiration date. Companies operating overseas use 
options as insurance against major unfavorable market shifts in the exchange 
rate and thus avoid locking their companies into guaranteed exchanges.
Trades are made using various currency symbols that are similar to the ones 
you need to know for stocks when seeking price quotes. Some of the more

You can find current exchange rates for most major currencies online at 
the Universal Currency converter (www.xe.com/ucc). You merely set an 
amount, the type of currency you want to convert, and the type of currency 
to which you want to convert to find out the exchange rate and how much 
the set amount of your currency is worth when converted or exchanged. 
Although this site won’t give you a rate at which you’re guaranteed to find a 
trade, it certainly gives you a decent estimate that’s in the ballpark of what 
you can expect to find to within six decimal points.
How Money Markets Work
The currency exchange market is made up of about 2,000 dealer institutions 
that are particularly active in foreign currency exchanges. Most of the play-
ers are commercial or investment banks that are geographically dispersed in 
the key financial centers around the world. Among these 2,000 dealers, about 
100 to 200 members carry on the core trading and market-making activities. 
Major players are fewer still.
When a dealer buys a U.S. dollar, regardless of where in the world the trans-
action takes place, the actual deposit is located either directly in a U.S. bank 
or in a claim of a foreign bank on a dollar deposit located in the United States. 
The same is true of the currency of any other country.

311
 Chapter 19: Going Foreign (Forex)
Different countries, different rules
The actual infrastructures of the various currency markets and how they 
operate are determined by each separate nation. Each country enforces its 
own laws, banking regulations, accounting rules, and tax codes. The method 
of payment and the settlement system also are determined separately by 
each country. Yikes, doesn’t that mean you have to know a lot about inter-
national monetary laws to be able to trade? Yup. Especially if you want to be 
successful.
Luckily, considerable global cooperation exists among exchange regulators, 
which minimizes differences and helps protect Forex traders from fraud and 
abuse. In the United States, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
(CFTC) sets rules and investigates any problems involving U.S. currency 
trades. The CFTC reaches agreements, or Memoranda of Understanding 
(MOUs), with most major nations that have active currency exchanges, and 
these MOUs form a method of cooperation between regulatory and enforce-
ment authorities across international borders that combats fraud and other 
illegal practices that can harm customers or threaten market integrity.
 
If you plan to become involved in foreign currency exchange, be sure to visit 
the CFTC’s Web site at www.cftc.gov to bone up on your knowledge of inter-
national laws and find information about recently exposed scams and other 
illegal activities. You certainly don’t want to get caught up in a fraudulent deal 
and lose all your money.
The almighty (U.S.) dollar
The U.S. dollar by far is the most widely traded currency. Based on a Federal 
Reserve survey, the dollar is one of two currencies that are involved in more 
than 85 percent of all global foreign exchange transactions. The U.S. dollar 
wears many hats, serving as an investment currency in many capital markets, 
a reserve currency for many central banks, a transaction currency for many 
commodity trades, an invoice currency for many contracts, and a currency of 
intervention used by countries that want to influence the values of their own 
currencies.
Organized exchanges
The money market is largely unregulated as a defined market. By that, we 
mean that a commercial bank in the United States doesn’t need any special 
authorization to trade or deal in foreign currencies. Securities and brokerage 

312
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
firms don’t need special permission from the SEC or any other regulatory 
body to carry out foreign exchange activities.
 
Transactions can be carried out based on whatever terms the law permits and 
using whatever provisions are acceptable to the two parties, subject to the 
commercial law governing business transactions. Of course that means the 
money market is the closest thing to the Wild West you’ll find in the trading 
world. Almost anything goes. Institutions that participate are not inspected 
specifically for their exchange practices, but regulatory authorities neverthe-
less look into trading systems as part of their regular examinations of financial 
institutions, just to be sure they’re operating under the country’s commercial 
banking or securities laws.
 
Although no official rules or restrictions govern the hours or conditions of 
trading on this over-the-counter (OTC) market in the United States, trading 
conventions developed mostly by market participants are in place. The OTC 
market for foreign currency trading is any currency trading done outside 
the confines of an exchange, such as the CME Group. You can find out what 
those rules are by contacting the Federal Bank of New York, which produces 
and regularly updates the Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Trading. These 
guidelines clarify common market practices and offer “best practice recom-
mendations.” Before you become a trader, protect yourself by making sure 
you’re working with a dealer or a broker that follows these guidelines. You 
can access the most current version, published in 2004, at www.newyorkfed.
org/fxc/2004/fxc040713b.pdf. The New York Federal Reserve regularly 
issues updates to the guidelines, which you can find on its Web site at www.
ny.frb.org.
The OTC currency exchange market accounts for more than 90 percent of the 
total U.S. foreign exchange market, including spot transactions, forwards, and 
swaps. If you’re new to Forex trading, starting out is much safer on an orga-
nized exchange, where you can trade currency futures and certain currency 
options. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is one of the largest, and it 
offers excellent educational materials to help you get started. Find out more 
about the CME at www.cmegroup.com/education.
Organized exchanges and regulations governing them are considerably dif-
ferent from the OTC foreign currency market. Trading actually takes place 
in a centralized location rather than through a network of computers, tel-
exes, and telephones. Hours and trading practices are regulated by each of 
the respective exchanges, and their products are standardized. Organized 
exchanges also are equipped with central clearinghouses for payments and 
cash settlements.

 Chapter 19: Going Foreign (Forex)
The Risks of the World Money Market
Leverage, which means borrowing money to trade, is the number one risk to 
your portfolio when trading in money markets. Success on the foreign cur-
rency exchange market means having to trade in large sums, because profits 
are made at exchange-rate differences of only fractions of a cent. Banks or 
brokers determine the leverage they want to offer you, but you won’t find 
strict regulations like the ones that govern stock margin accounts.
After you’re approved for trading, customers are given a set amount or allow-
ance on which they can trade on margin. A common starting allowance for 
trading on margin is 5 percent (see Chapter 14 for more about margins), 
which means that if you put $100,000 in the bank, you’re allowed to execute 
transactions of up to $2 million. As you gain success with more experience, 
that margin may be lowered to 1 percent, which means you’d be allowed to 
trade as much as $10 million on your $100,000 deposit.
 
When trading at those high margin levels, even a minor mistake can wipe out 
your entire deposit.
The most conservative of banks require full margin, meaning you have to 
deposit $1 million to be able to trade $1 million. Be sure that you understand 
the leverage you’re being offered and the loss potential you face if your trade 
goes sour. Just imagine starting with $100,000, which you can use to trade $2 
million dollars, and then losing half of that trading maximum with trades that 
have gone sour. You could end up $900,000 in the hole. Sure, lots of traders 
can come up with that — no problem. In reality, as long as you stick to trading, 
the major currencies’ drastic price changes that end up in that type of loss are 
unlikely, but a loss of 10 to 20 percent of your holding in a matter of minutes 
can happen. Only trading in third-world currencies could result in losses of the 
million dollar magnitude described here and only if there was a major uprising 
in the country and the price of its currency dropped dramatically.
Types of risks
You also face a number of different kinds of risk, including market risk, 
exchange risk, interest rate risk, counterparty risk, volatility risk, liquidity 
risk, and country risk.
Market risk
All traders and investors face market risk. Basically, market risk is comprised 
of changes in price that adversely impact your trade or investment. Market 
risk is in play from the moment you enter into a foreign currency exchange 

314
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
position until the moment you exit it. The foreign exchange rate can change 
any time during that period, so when you’re dealing in foreign currency 
exchange, two key factors can impact the price of the currency — exchange 
risk and interest rate risk.
Exchange risk
Foreign exchange traders take on exchange risk the moment they buy or sell 
a foreign currency. Every time you take on a new foreign exchange position, 
regardless of whether it’s through a spot, forward, future, or option transac-
tion, you’re immediately exposed to the potential that the exchange rate will 
move against your position, making it worth less than when you bought it. In 
only a matter of seconds, a profitable transaction can turn into an unprofit-
able one.
Interest rate risk
Foreign exchange positions can change in value not only because of the 
exchange rate but also because of the currency’s underlying interest rate. 
Whenever a country’s central bank (think Federal Reserve) raises or lowers 
the underlying interest rate for its currency, the impact on any positions 
you’re holding in that country’s currency can be a major one.
Counterparty risk
In the currency trading world, a counterparty is the other entity involved in a 
transaction — a bank or banker, a broker, or another trader. When you buy 
a currency option or execute a forward transaction, you risk the possibility 
that the counterparty to your transaction won’t be able to meet his, her, or 
its obligations.
Note: Whenever you buy the option through an exchange, rather than 
directly from the counterparty, this risk is not a factor. When that happens, 
you run into additional replacement costs, because you’re forced to enter 
into another currency transaction to meet your own foreign currency needs. 
The key to avoiding this kind of risk is entering into contracts with known 
entities that have high credit ratings. Additionally, you need to investigate 
whether the counterparty with which you’re trading has had any problems 
with regulators, insolvency, or questions of ethical conduct. One good place 
to begin your investigation is the consumer protection section of the CFTC at 
www.cftc.gov/customerprotection/index.htm.
When evaluating a company, you first need to consider its credit risk. You 
can find credit rankings for many major banks at the Standard & Poor’s Web 
site (www2.standardandpoors.com). You can research a company’s credit-
worthiness by investigating the requirements and standards it uses when 
providing credit to its customers. Companies that provide easy credit to 

315
 Chapter 19: Going Foreign (Forex)
their customers run a greater risk of not being able to meet their obligations. 
Conversely, companies with higher margin limits definitely are safer to do 
business with when you’re entering into a contract.
Volatility risk
Volatility risk relates to the possibility of rapidly changing exchange rates 
that can impact your positions in foreign currencies. As we mention in the 
“Exploring the World of Foreign Currency Exchange” section, earlier in this 
chapter, currency prices can change thousands of times per day. Options on 
currencies are valued according to volatility and underlying changes in the 
prices of the respective currencies. If a trader sees an increase of 100 per-
cent in volatility, or a doubling of volatility, then the price of the option can 
increase 5 percent to 10 percent. If you’re trading on credit, which is highly 
likely, your bank or broker can reevaluate the credit it’s extending to you 
whenever it sees a dramatic increase in the volatility of your holdings.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is not a major factor if you’re trading in the more commonly 
traded currencies, but if you decide to trade in less active currencies, it 
can become a factor when you’re unable to sell a currency you hold at the 
expressed time you want the sale to take place, especially when the market 
for that currency is not active. You can avoid liquidity risk by buying cur-
rency options or futures on an exchange.
Country risk
Country risks come in several different varieties, all of which you need to 
consider whenever you trade in foreign currencies. Among those aspects are
 
✓ Political risk: This variety relates to the political stability of the country 
in whose currency you’re trading. Although we haven’t seen any recent 
seizures of commercial assets by any nations, it has happened in the 
past. For example, Venezuela took control of its oil industry by seizing 
assets of non-Venezuelan oil companies. If you trade in currencies of 
countries that are at risk of possible destabilization, the currency you 
buy can become worthless if the country changes political leaders.
 
✓ Regulation risk: This variety relates to what can happen after you estab-
lish a position in a country’s currency. Its government can change its 
regulations, and in effect, put restraints on the ownership established by 
your position in the currency and by the position of your counterparty — 
and that can get messy.
 
✓ Legal risk: This variety relates to which country has jurisdiction to rule on 
a contract if your counterparty happens to default. Unfavorable contract 
law in the host country of your counterparty can end up determining that 

316
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
the contract is invalid or illegal, and you can lose your position. Be sure 
that you understand from whom you’re buying and under which country’s 
laws any disputes will be settled. If U.S. law won’t be the overriding law for 
the contract, be certain you understand contract law in the country of the 
counterparty with whom you’re trading.
 
✓ Holiday risk: This variety relates to the possibility that the country in 
whose currency you’re trading has different religious, political, or gov-
ernmental holidays that can shut down trading in that currency right 
when you need the money. Be sure you know the holiday schedules for 
the countries in whose currencies you trade.
Seeking risk protection
Although trading in foreign currencies often is called the modern-day Wild 
West, forces are in place that can help you minimize the risks — provided 
you take advantage of them and trade within their boundaries. The primary 
monitors of foreign currency trading are the world’s central banks. They 
monitor the flow of money between countries and the balance of payments 
between governments and banking institutions. In the United States, these 
types of transactions are monitored and regulated by the U.S. Treasury 
Department and the Federal Reserve Banks. Similar regulatory authorities 
exist in most major currency markets, but if you decide to do business with 
a nonbanking institution, you’re transacting your business in unprotected 
waters outside the safe harbor of regulatory oversight and must do so under 
the often fateful guise of caveat emptor — let the buyer beware.
Internationally, the Bank for International Settlement (BIS — www.bis.org/
index.htm) is the leading independent agency for evaluating foreign 
exchange trading institutions on a global basis. BIS created risk-weighted 
evaluation and capital requirements for institutions that trade in foreign 
currencies and money market transactions. Be certain that any institution 
outside the United States with which you plan to conduct trades meets BIS 
standards.
A number of common clearing systems assist with the transfer of foreign 
currencies. The two best-known ones are the Clearing House Interbank 
Payments System, or CHIPS, and the Society for Worldwide Interbank 
Financial Telecommunication, or S.W.I.F.T. Be sure you’re using one of these 
systems when you trade, because they code transactions to avoid defaults 
and help you identify the creditworthiness of transactions. CHIPS is privately 
owned and operated by the New York Clearing House.

317
 Chapter 19: Going Foreign (Forex)
If you’re trading in foreign currency futures, your risks are much less, 
because the futures industry is highly regulated. Clearinghouses for futures 
are efficient, and futures transactions usually are cleared hourly or in some 
cases even minute-by-minute.
Getting Ready to Trade Money
Your first step as a foreign currency trader is to develop an extensive col-
lection of historical information not only about rate fluctuations for the cur-
rencies you plan to trade but also about interest rate fluctuations, economic 
history, and political stability of the countries whose currencies you’re con-
sidering. Gathering some background information about the Forex market 
itself doesn’t hurt either. You can find more details about trading currency in 
Currency Trading For Dummies by Mark Galant and Brian Dolan (Wiley).
After collecting this information, you need to consider your own trading 
goals and how much you want to put at risk. Set your risk limits before you 
start, so you don’t get emotionally caught up in having to making these 
potentially disastrous trading decisions on the fly. Capital that you risk on 
foreign currency exchange trading needs to be money that you can afford to 
lose without impacting your lifestyle. Do not, for any reason, use retirement 
savings, savings for your children’s educations, or savings required to main-
tain your house and lifestyle.
 
As is true for stock trading, when trading currencies, you need to develop a 
plan that determines what you trade and how much you’re at risk. When your 
plan’s in place, you need to stick to it for the entire trading day. You should 
not be developing the plan and executing it at the same time. Foreign currency 
trading requires a great deal of focus, and you can’t risk breaking that focus to 
do additional planning in the middle of a trading day. Monitor the successes 
you have in meeting the goals of your plan. If you’re not achieving your objec-
tives, you may want to step back and reevaluate your plan and your decision 
to trade in foreign currency.
Technical analysis is used by foreign currency traders in a way that is similar 
to stock trading (see Chapters 9 and 10). Bar charts are the most common 
tools. The basic bar chart shows the opening, high, low, and closing prices 
for a given period of time.
 
The key difference between trading currencies and stocks is that in the foreign 
exchange market, a daily price chart sometimes shows the opening price in 
the Pacific Rim and the closing price in the United States. Because the foreign 

318
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
exchange market is open 24 hours a day, time periods are different for foreign 
currency trading than they are for stock trading. You can play with Forex 
charting online at www.forex-markets.com/charts.htm.
We won’t cover the basics of technical analysis for foreign currency trad-
ing, because we’d need to take up another entire book to do it right. That’s 
exactly why Wiley Publishing, Inc., also publishes Technical Analysis For 
Dummies by Barbara Rockefeller. Be sure to check it out, too.
 
Because we can’t say it enough, we repeat: If you truly want to pursue this 
form of trading, we highly recommend that you seek additional training before 
you begin trading individually.

nations, such as Series 7 or Series 23. Nope, they’re not talking about 
the World Series. These designations refer to examinations, administered by 
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), that you must pass to

tests you need to take depend on where you plan to work and what you plan 
to do.
You also may hear an alphabet soup of designations like CFA, CFP, or CFS. 
They are certifications given by different professional organizations to 
people who have completed coursework, testing, and in most cases, years of 
work experience.
Typically, investment and trading advisors must be licensed. In this chapter, 
we discuss the various types of licenses and certifications and the level of 
training that is required for each. We also describe the types of tests FINRA

Brokers can’t just hang out a shingle and advertise that they’re selling secu-
rities. Before ever selling the first share of stock, a broker must complete 
coursework and pass an examination administered by FINRA to become a 
registered securities broker, agent, or salesperson.
A number of different types of exams are required for brokers to demonstrate 
their knowledge of the various types of securities they plan to sell. Each 
examination indicates whether candidates have an understanding of specific 
products they want to sell and the laws that govern investing in them.
 
Failure to register with FINRA can result in hefty fines imposed by the United 
States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or state regulators when-
ever you try to sell securities as an unregistered broker. People who plan to 
supervise other brokers must take additional coursework and training.
 
Courses to prepare candidates for these exams are available for home study, 
or they can be taken on-site at various training centers throughout the United 
States. You can schedule tests through Pearson VUE National Registration 
Center by calling 866-396-6273 or online at www.pearsonvue.com/finra, or 
through Prometric by calling 800-578-6273 or online at www.prometric.com/
finra.
Two sets of examinations are administered, one for registered representa-
tives, or the people on the front lines, and the other for principals who 
manage registered representatives. In the sections that follow, we give you 
an overview of the types of examinations and licenses that people who want 
to do business in the securities market must take, including what you can 
expect to find on some of the key tests.
 
To pass any of the FINRA examinations that we discuss in the sections that 
follow, you must answer at least 70 percent of the questions correctly to 
become registered or licensed as a broker or principal in the areas evaluated 
by each specific exam.
Becoming a registered representative
Registered representatives are licensed by the FINRA to sell various kinds of 
securities. The type of security a registered representative is allowed to sell 
depends on the tests he or she has taken and passed. What follows are dis-
cussions of some of the key licensure tests.

 Chapter 20: Trading for Others: Obtaining Trading Licenses and Certifications
Series 3: National Commodity Futures
The FINRA administers the National Commodity Futures Examination (Series 
3), but it’s actually required by the National Futures Association (NFA), 
which regulates the futures markets. Topics covered on this test include 
options and contracts, futures theory, hedging, margins and settlements, 
rules of the NFA and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and man-
aging customer accounts and orders.
Test takers are given 150 minutes to answer 120 multiple-choice questions.
Series 6: Investment Co./Variable Contract Representative
The Investment Company Products/Variable Contracts Limited Representative 
(Series 6) Examination is FINRA’s licensing test and is for individuals who want

minutes to complete it. Test questions are grouped under six topic areas:

who pass this exam can solicit, purchase, and/or sell all securities products, 
including corporate securities like stocks and bonds, municipal securities, 
municipal fund securities, options, direct participation programs, investment 
company products, and variable contracts.
In the general information it provides about the exam, FINRA says the pri-
mary purpose for this exam is “to safeguard the investing public by helping 
to insure that registered representatives are competent to perform their jobs. 
Given this purpose, the Series 7 Examination seeks to measure accurately 
and reliably the degree to which each candidate possesses the knowledge, 
skills and abilities needed to perform the critical functions of a registered 
representative (RR).”
Test takers face 250 multiple-choice questions, 10 of which are experimental 
questions that are being evaluated for future use. The test is given in two 

322
Part V: Risk-Taker’s Paradise 
180-minute segments. The test focuses on the seven critical functions about 
which registered representatives need to be tested. The number of questions 
on the test devoted to each function is shown in parentheses below. The reg-
istered representative must have the ability to

customers (9 questions).

available investment capital, and help them identify their investment 
objectives (4 questions).

additional testing to supervise the sales activities in corporate, municipal, 
and options securities; investment company products; variable contracts; 
and direct participation programs. The General Securities Sales Supervisor 
(Series 9) Examination focuses on the regulation of options, and the Series 
10 exam with the same name focuses on sales supervision. Supervisors must 
pass these tests to be able to register with FINRA. A valid Series 7 license is

Becoming a registered principal
If you want to manage an office in investment banking or the securities busi-
ness, you must pass at least one additional exam to be registered as a prin-
cipal. Principals supervise, solicit, and conduct business, and train persons 
associated with the offices they manage. All principals must have their Series

nesses you’ll be managing. Some of the key principal exams are covered in 
the following sections.

People who want to manage or supervise others in investment banking or 
the securities business, including the sales of direct participation programs, 
investment company products, and variable contracts, must fulfill either the 
Series 23 or Series 24 requirements for becoming a general securities prin-
cipal. Candidates who already have successfully completed the Series 9 and 
10 exams take the Series 23 exam, which covers material from the Series 24 
exam that was not on the sales supervisor’s Series 9 and Series 10 exams.

The ABCs of Financial Advisors
When you get a business card from a broker or other type of investment advi-
sor, you may see a long list of initials that indicate professional certifications. 
Some of these require extensive training, education, and testing, but others 
require only minimal education and testing. In addition to the initial testing, 
some require continuing education and offer a disciplinary process and ways 
to check on a professional’s status online. The sections that follow break 
down the key designations for financial advisors and what getting and keep-
ing the designation takes.

The Licenses and Certifications You 
Need When Trading for Others
If you decide you want to trade for others as well as for yourself, you need to 
become a registered representative. The most comprehensive test you can 
take is the NASD’s Series 7 Exam, and you’ll need a sponsoring broker. Most 
times, when you sign up for the required coursework for this examination, 
either through self-study courses online or through a nearby training school, 
the school can help you locate a sponsoring broker if you don’t have one.
This license enables you to purchase and/or sell all securities products, 
including corporate securities, municipal securities, municipal fund securi-
ties, options, direct participation programs, investment company prod-
ucts, and variable contracts. Most of the other representative exams are 
taken whenever you want to sell only a specific type of security rather than 
the broader options that a Series 7 certification enables you to market. 
Professional certifications are not required to sell securities. Most pros 
who seek these certifications do so to show their clients that they have 
attained a level of proficiency and met or exceeded the standards within 
their specialties.
As you read through the requirements and courses mentioned in this chap-
ter, you may have found subjects that can help you improve the management 
of your own funds. Many schools that train people for professional designa-
tions provide ways for others like you to take the coursework, even if you 
don’t plan to get the license or certification. You can even study for many of 
these courses at home online. Some of the schools offering online education 
services in the securities and financial advisor area include the following:
 
✓ American Investment Training (www.aitraining.com), which offers 
self-study training for all the FINRA licenses
 
✓ The American College (www.theamericancollege.edu/), which 
offers online coursework toward the ChFC, CLU, and CFP designations 
along with other financial services education

333

✓ College for Financial Planning (www.cffp.edu), which offers online

cial services education
 
✓ Empire Stockbroker Training Institute (www.empirestockbroker.

As you probably realize by now, selling securities is a highly regulated field 
that requires considerable training before you can sell even your first share 
of stock. Although some people privately trade for others, they risk the pos-
sibility of an investigation by the NASD or their state regulators whenever they 
do so without registering at the state or federal level. Be sure that the trading 
activities you do for others fit within the law, or you can end up in a legal mess 
facing significant fines.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
W
e join in the For Dummies tradition of showing you 
some special lists of ten (or so) important and key 
factors that help you with your trading. We review ten 
common and huge trading mistakes and how to avoid 
them, and we describe ten basics strategies necessary for 
your survival and long-term financial well-being as a 
trader.

Chapter 21
Ten (Or More) Huge Trading 
Mistakes
In This Chapter
▶ Trying to trade tops and bottoms (no, this isn’t X-rated)
▶ Becoming attached to your trading systems and your stocks
▶ Making decisions on the fly
▶ Losing too much
T
his chapter introduces you to ten (more, actually) huge trading mistakes 
that befall experienced and novice traders. We offer suggestions for help-
ing you recognize the mistakes and for avoiding and even correcting them.
Fishing for Bottoms
Bottom fishing — trying to catch a stock as it bottoms out — is a great way to 
get soaked and lose a bucketful of money. In a bear market, stocks get much 
cheaper than most of us ever expect or want. They won’t stop falling until 
they’ve run out of gas.
The psychology of a bear market is perverse. As long as traders remain inter-
ested in a stock, many are the moments when it seems like the stock may 
recover. The thing is, stocks rarely turn on a dime and head higher. Only 
after the momentum crowd loses interest does the stock’s downward price 
slide end. When value investors, who can’t resist a bargain, begin nibbling, 
the stock begins to stabilize; however, it also may spend a very long time 
bouncing around in a trading range.
Traders have few, if any, reasons for entering the market when a stock is 
trading in a range. Your best opportunity for profit occurs when the stock 
breaks out of its trading range. Chapter 9 shows how to identify these trad-
ing-range breakout patterns. Instead of risking your trading capital on unreli-
able bottoming patterns, wait until you’re sure.

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Timing the Top
Tops and bottoms share something in common. They rarely arrive when 
they’re supposed to. When traders and investors are exuberant, they keep 
buying even after doing so no longer makes fundamental sense. That’s why 
shorting a stock that’s trending higher makes no sense, even if its price is far 
beyond reasonable.
You don’t have to have a lengthy memory or an encyclopedic knowledge of 
stock market history to remember what happened to Internet stocks in the 
late 1990s. Those were heady days. Stocks went in only one direction — up. 
Some of those magically levitating companies had modest revenues, but few 
had earnings. Nevertheless, traders bid hundreds of dollars per share for 
some worthless junk. Just like the recent housing bubble, Internet stocks 
were a case of mass hysteria, mob mentality, market madness, or all three.
Call it what you will, when a bubble is inflating definitely is not a time to 
short related stocks. Sure, these stocks eventually crashed and burned, but 
not before depleting the trading accounts of a den full of bearish short sell-
ers. Don’t guess. Wait for reliable trading signals, like the ones discussed in 
Chapters 9 and 10, before entering a position.
You might be asking if there were reliable trading signals before the Internet 
bubble burst. Not before; traders aren’t fortune tellers (see Chapter 8). 
However, the risks at the time were well known. And when stocks began 
heading lower early in 2000, you had all the information you needed to pro-
tect your profits and trading capital, and begin selling short. The signals were 
also there in early 2008 that the market was set for another fall. Chapter 13 
uses the NASDAQ bubble as an example to show how to evaluate market risk 
and adjust your trading strategy as the market transitions from a rising to a 
falling market.
Trading Against the Dominant Trend
Trading against the dominant trend in the market leads to costly mistakes. 
Unfortunately, misidentifying the trend by focusing on the chart in front of 
you and forgetting to look at the next higher level chart is an easy thing to 
do. You may see a promising uptrend occur with a pullback on the intraday 
charts. But on the daily chart, the trend you saw on the intraday chart actu-
ally turns out to be a consolidation rally during a strong downtrend. The 
promising pullback actually is the beginning of the next leg down on the daily 
chart. If you buy long in a situation like this one, hoping to capture the next 
leg up, your position will be swamped (and so will your trading capital) by 
the flood of sell orders coming from traders who recognize the implications 
of the longer-term stronger trend.

 Chapter 21: Ten (or More) Huge Trading Mistakes
Regardless of the specific indications of the chart you’re looking at, always 
confirm your analysis by looking at charts that are one time period higher. 
For example, if you’re studying daily charts, confirm your analysis on the 
weekly charts. If you’re studying intraday charts, confirm your analysis on 
the daily charts. Always know which part of the market cycle you’re in and 
what types of industries excel in that part of the cycle. See Chapters 10 and 
13 for additional information.
Don’t try to buy long based on a brief intraday move, when the dominant 
trend on the daily charts is down. Doing so is a great way of giving up your 
trading capital to someone else.
Winging It
Traders get into big trouble when they wing it. Maybe you heard the guy on 
business TV say the stock was hot and heading higher. Maybe you saw the 
news that a new product was bound to be a big hit. Although that may sound 
like great information, instead it’s only a reason to look into the fundamental 
and technical conditions of a company’s stock, but not a reason to buy today.
Devise a strategy. We think that’s such great advice, we’ll say it again. Devise 
a strategy. Develop and test a trading system that matches your goals and 
personality (see Chapter 15). Plan your trades and execute your plan. Wait 
patiently for your signals to trigger your trades. Pick your entry and exit 
points before entering your order. Have a plan and stick to it.
Traders also get into trouble when they start second-guessing their trading 
plans. Sometimes, even in the middle of executing a trade, you need to make 
a decision but won’t be sure which decision is right.
When in doubt, close the position. It’s easier to think clearly when your 
money isn’t at risk. You can always buy back the stock if further analysis con-
firms it’s the right thing to do.
Taking Trading Personally
A losing trade is bad for your trading account, but you can’t let it get to you. 
Sure, it makes you feel bad, but a losing trade doesn’t impugn your honor 
or disparage your heritage. A bad trade may reduce your net worth, but it 
shouldn’t damage your self-esteem. Entering a losing trade certainly doesn’t 
mean that you’re a nincompoop or blockhead — any more than closing a win-
ning trade signals your brilliance and mastery of all you survey.

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The market isn’t out to get you; it’s out to get your money. Don’t take trading 
personally. A losing trade is just another losing trade. You’ll have plenty of 
them. Get used to it.
Falling In Love
Trading is a business. Your stocks are your inventory. Smart business owners 
don’t fall in love with their inventory. It’s there to sell, at a profit if possible, 
at a loss if necessary. And smart businesspeople don’t fall in love with their 
business models. If it isn’t working, they change it; otherwise, they’ll be out of 
business before you can say “liquidation sale.”
When you fall in love with your stock, you risk large losses. When you fall 
in love with your trading plan, you risk many more losses. It’s easy to fall in 
love. After doing hours of research and analysis, you want to be right. You 
want your trades and your trading plans to generate profits, but hoping 
doesn’t make it so.
Be smart. Don’t fall in love. Your trading system doesn’t have feelings and 
your stock won’t love you back. Be prepared to jettison positions and trading 
systems that don’t do what they’re supposed to do. See Chapter 12 for more 
about trading as a business and effectively managing your inventory.
Using After-Hours Market Orders
When the market opens and it’s off to the races, the market order that you 
placed last night before going to bed is going to be swept up in a wave of 
frantic trading. Bad fills are sure to be the result. You’re likely to pay consid-
erably more to buy a stock that you want or to sell one for considerably less 
than you’d planned. You should never place a market order when entering 
trades after the market is closed (after-hours). Instead, define how much 
you’re willing to buy or sell a stock for by using a stop order, a limit order, 
or a stop-limit order. Chapter 14 discusses the mechanics of entering these 
types of orders.
Chasing a Runaway Trend
If you miss the breakout entry point for a stock that you want, waiting is 
better than entering a position as a trend accelerates. See Chapter 10 for 
information about identifying and trading a trend. Often, stocks will pull back 
and test the breakout point. Wait for that point, or wait for the stock to take 

341
 Chapter 21: Ten (or More) Huge Trading Mistakes
a short breather after its first leg up. If you’re still interested, that’s a better 
entry point than chasing a stock as it accelerates into the trend. Like a fine 
wine, you sometimes need to let a stock breathe.
On the other hand, if you already have a position in a runaway stock, try 
planning your exit so that you leave a little money on the table. Capturing 
every last nickel of the trend is almost impossible, anyway, so don’t try. 
Instead, consider trimming your position as the stock reaches for the strato-
sphere. If you’re using margin, consider taking some profit off the table and 
reducing your leverage a bit. We discuss this strategy further in Chapter 
13, and the mechanics of using margin are covered in Chapter 14. When a 
runaway stock stops going up and everyone wants out at the same time, the 
speed at which the price falls is remarkable. Be ready to jettison stocks that 
rally too fast at the first sign of trouble.
Averaging Down
Averaging down is a below-average idea. You sometimes hear advisors sug-
gesting it as a way of reducing your cost basis, but it’s merely a technique to 
throw good money after bad. The logic of averaging down is completely con-
trary to the logic of trading. Traders sell losers. They don’t reward them with 
infusions of trading capital.
However, averaging up makes some sense. Traders call it pyramiding. The 
idea is to add to your winning positions when your trading system triggers 
new trading signals in the direction of the trend. Pyramiding is a good way 
of building a large position in a strongly trending stock. Be aware of the risk, 
though. The larger your position, the more it hurts when the trend ends and 
the stock’s price begins to fall. Be ready to trim your pyramid position at the 
first sign of trouble.
Ignoring Your Stops
Talking yourself out of honoring your stops is an easy thing to do. You’ll be 
tempted when a trade goes against you. You’ll look at your indicators and the 
support levels on your charts, and you’ll be certain that the stock soon will 
stop falling. When you start thinking you want to give a position a little room 
to work its way out of losing territory, you’re on your way toward a trading 
debacle. It’s wishful thinking, it’s hoping against hope, and it’s a good way to 
lose a lot of money. Unless you’re omniscient, close the position when the 
price hits your stop. Take your loss. Chapter 14 discusses stop orders and 
how to use them.

342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Diversifying Badly
Exposing all your capital in one trade is a bad idea, and so is trading hun-
dreds of stocks simultaneously. A happy medium can be found somewhere in 
between.
You can monitor only so many positions and do it well. You need only so 
many positions to diversify your risk. And although you can have too few or 
too many stocks in your trading portfolio, no perfect number — one that is 
right for every trader — exists. That said, you nevertheless have to figure out 
what the right number is for you. Start with 10 or 15 positions. You may end 
up deciding that eight is enough. The Bradford family did. However, unless 
you have an extremely large portfolio, imagining why you’d need any more 
than 20 positions is difficult.
The simple wisdom is this: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. And don’t 
chop your eggs into little pieces and spread them across many dozens of bas-
kets. You want to diversify, just not too much.
Enduring Large Losses
To trade is to lose. No matter how good your trading system is, no matter 
how experienced you are, and no matter which stocks you pick, you’re going 
to have losing trades. Your success as a trader depends on how you handle 
those losing trades. If you dispose of the losers quickly, you can become a 
very successful trader. But if you hold on to those losing positions, you can 
lose so much money that it may knock you right out of the trading business.
Using margin (see Chapter 14) exacerbates the problem of losing trades. 
Margin is a wonderful thing, because with careful application, it can magnify 
your profits. But on the flip side, with indiscriminate use, it can also magnify 
your losses. If you want to turn your pool of trading capital into a puddle, 
leverage a lot of losing trades.
Small losses won’t hurt you much, but large losses will. If you use margin and 
fail to cut your losses, you won’t be a trader for long.

Top Ten Trading Survival 
Techniques
In This Chapter
▶ Building your tool chest
▶ Understanding and using averages
▶ Developing your own trading system
▶ Taking profits and avoiding losses
▶ Buying on strength, selling on weakness
▶ Reviewing your journal
T
rading is not a risk-free activity. Although all traders know that losses are 
inevitable, they want to minimize those losses and be around to trade 
another day. In this chapter, we review ten of the top trading survival tech-
niques that can help you enter the world of trading and enable you to con-
tinue to trade for a long time to come.
Build Your Trading Tool Chest
Before you buy that first share of stock, that first option or futures contract, 
or any other security, you need to be certain that you have the right mix of 
trading software, hardware, and Internet access to be successful. You need 
the right tools to identify trading candidates; display and interpret charts; 
research trading opportunities; screen stocks for technical or fundamental 
constraints; and monitor and analyze your portfolio, open positions, market 
indexes, sectors, and trading statistics. In summary, the proper tools are 
critical to finding the right trades and then monitoring those positions after 
you’ve found and entered them.

344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Even after you’ve found them, if you don’t have the right tools, you may not 
be able to enter and exit positions efficiently, control or track your orders, 
track your profits and losses, analyze your trading history, or monitor eco-
nomic reports, earnings, and other business news.
The proper tools help you evaluate your trading system and test your trad-
ing ideas. They enable you to keep trading logs to review your trading per-
formance. You also can use tools to stay in touch with other traders and 
exchange ideas that ultimately may help you improve your trading skills and 
discover new trading opportunities.
Tools are the core of any good trader’s business. Without the right ones, 
your chances of success drop dramatically. Don’t scrimp on the tools you 
select for your trading activities. (For more information, see Chapter 4.)
Use Both Technical and 
Fundamental Analyses
You may have heard that all traders use technical analysis and believe that 
fundamental analysis is a waste of time. Don’t believe it. Although techni-
cal analysis is crucial to finding the right entry and exit points, fundamental 
analysis improves your ability to make the right stock choices, given market 
and economic conditions.
You’ll find as a trader that knowing the current state of the economy and the 
state of the market is critical. You obviously want to buy stocks in the bull 
market and sell them, or short them, in a bear market, but do you know how 
to recognize when the market is entering a period of transition so you can 
make your moves when the opportunity for making profitable trades or mini-
mizing potential losses is greatest?
Using a combination of fundamental and technical analyses, your chances 
of identifying bull and bear markets and finding phases of transition and 
consolidation improve dramatically. Your best trading opportunities are at 
the beginning of these phases of change, so be sure that you understand the 
six phases of the market and know which sectors offer you the best trading 
opportunities within each of those phases. (For more information, see Parts 
II and III.)

345
 Chapter 22: Top Ten Trading Survival Techniques
Choose and Use Your Favorite 
Tools Wisely
As you begin sorting out your software and hardware and making contact 
with other traders, you’ll probably find out about the hundreds of tools and 
charts that are out there on the market. You don’t need to learn and use 
them all. Using too many tools can be as dangerous to your trading system 
and your sanity as using too few. You’ll find that you get mixed signals and 
will probably end up in a state of analysis paralysis trying to figure out which 
tool is giving you the right signal.
To avoid driving yourself crazy, pick the top two or three trading tools that 
make sense to you and fit your trading style. Take your time getting to know 
how they work and how best to interpret the information they generate. Use 
them to build the types of charts that match your trading style and don’t 
worry about learning all the new gadgets. If your tools are working and you’re 
making a good profit, don’t rush to add the newest tool innovation.
Keep your eyes open for new tools that can improve your trading profits, 
but use caution before making changes to your winning trading system. (For 
more information, see Chapter 15.)
Count on the Averages 
to Make Your Moves
You may think that using data from averages to find the right time to enter or 
exit a position is counterintuitive, but moving averages can be powerful trad-
ing indicators. Moving averages actually smooth out the data for you visually 
and help you identify any trends. Although they cannot predict the future, 
they nevertheless help you understand the past so you can more effectively 
extrapolate what may happen to a stock in the future.
Traders use many different types of moving averages in hundreds of different 
ways. Stock closing prices are the most common data being averaged, but 
any value on a price chart can be smoothed for interpretation. For example, 
traders sometimes manipulate the moving averages by using the mid-point 
between the high and low prices to develop the moving average. Others look 
for the moving average using the open, high, or low price. It’s all a matter 
of trading style and how the charts you’re developing match your trading 
system.

346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Be sure to find out how to use moving averages and what they mean. After 
you understand them and what goes into them, you can manipulate moving 
averages to your advantage and to coincide with your trading style. Moving 
averages are powerful indicators, but they’re not the only type of indicator 
you need to use in choosing your trades; use moving averages in conjunction 
with other indicators. (For more information, see Chapter 11.)
Develop and Manage 
Your Trading System
You need to have a road map that helps you find buy and sell signals for 
your trades. A trading system is such a map, because it’s developed using a 
collection of tools created from technical and fundamental analyses woven 
together to let you know when it’s time to enter or exit positions. You can 
buy trading systems off the shelf, but these systems are available to thou-
sands of others who ultimately will end up with the same buy and sell signals.
To be able to trade outside the pack, you need to develop your own trading 
system, using your own favorite tools. Although you can use tools provided 
in off-the-shelf software packages, you want to develop and adapt a trading 
system that fits uniquely with your personality and trading objectives.
After initially developing and testing your own trading system, your work 
is not done. You’ll need to constantly monitor your system’s successes and 
failures and look for ways to make improvements. (For more information, see 
Chapter 15.)
Know Your Costs
Trading isn’t cheap. Not only do you have to worry about commissions or 
transaction fees, you also must watch for any slippage in your trades. Even 
though you may be using stop or limit orders, you rarely end up executing 
trades at the exact entry or exit prices you plan. Some slippage, or the differ-
ence between the quoted price and the actual price for the security, is bound 
to occur, so you need to be sure that you carefully monitor your commission 
costs, transaction fees, and slippage costs.
In addition, don’t forget to consider the tax man. If you’re trading stocks 
that you hold for less than a year, any profits you make are taxed as current 
income rather than at lower capital gains tax rates.

347
 Chapter 22: Top Ten Trading Survival Techniques
Traders must also avoid being caught by wash sale rules. Most trading losses 
can be used to offset trading gains and thus reduce your income tax burden, 
but if you sell a stock for a loss and repurchase the same stock within 30 
days, your trading loss for that transaction cannot be deducted. You have to 
wait until you sell the stock again and use any losses to reduce the cost basis 
of the trade, which reduces the tax owed when the position is finally closed. 
Full-time day traders receive special tax treatment, but you must be a bona 
fide day trader to qualify. (For more information, see Chapters 2 and 14.)
Know When to Hold ’Em 
and When to Fold ’Em
Knowing when to take your profits and get out and when to accept your 
losses and close a position before it becomes even more damaging can be 
among the hardest lessons any trader must learn. All too often you’re enticed 
by the win and want to ride it to the absolute top.
Wise traders plan their exit points at the top and bottom of each position 
long before they ever enter that position. And, more importantly, they stick 
to their plan. Getting caught up in the emotions of a winning trade is easy, 
but don’t forget you’re operating a business. Take your profits when you 
reach your goal and get out, so you don’t risk turning a winning position into 
a loss.
When you make a mistake, own up to it quickly, take your hit, and get out 
of the position. If the stock recovers, you can always reenter the position at 
a later time. Don’t ride a stock to the bottom just to try to prove you were 
right. Plan your exit points before you buy and stick to them. (For more infor-
mation, see Chapter 12.)
Watch for Signals, Don’t 
Anticipate Them
After you make a decision to buy a stock, you may find that you’re impatient 
to actually get into that position. You start watching the charts and wait-
ing for the right signal to buy. Often, you’ll see charts move close to your 
planned signal but not actually reach it.

348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Be patient. Wait for the signal you’ve designated in your plan. Don’t antici-
pate any moves, even if the stock price is getting close to that point on your 
charts. You may miss the perfect entry point, but you’ll be less likely to make 
that fatal mistake of entering a position before the signal is triggered only to 
see your stock reverse course and thus be forced to take a loss. (For more 
information, see Chapters 10 and 13.)
Buy on Strength, Sell on Weakness
Buy on strength and sell on weakness is a mantra you’ve probably heard fre-
quently from investment and trading gurus. The reason for its popularity is a 
good one: It works! And it needs to become your trading way of life.
When you see a stock showing strength and heading into an uptrend, it’s time 
to buy. When you see a stock falling and showing signs of entering a weaken-
ing period, it’s time to sell. If a weak stock takes a turn for the better, you can 
always reenter the position. (For more information, see Chapter 13.)
Keep a Trading Journal 
and Review It Often
The only way you can ever improve your trading skills is by keeping track of 
what works and what doesn’t and trying to gauge why. After each trade, take 
the time to write down the details of the trade and what went right and/or 
wrong with that trade. You can only improve what you measure, so measure 
everything and put it in your trading journal.
Don’t forget to review the contents of your journal every week. You may 
find that reviewing your successes is enjoyable but reviewing your failures 
is difficult. Failure, however, sometimes is the best teacher. Many people 
discover more from their failures than from their successes. Try figuring out 
why your failed trades didn’t work and what you could’ve done to improve 
your results. Of course, don’t ignore your successes. After all, you need to 
know what works and why and then try to incorporate those winning strate-
gies more consistently into your trading system. (For more information, see 
Chapter 15.)
