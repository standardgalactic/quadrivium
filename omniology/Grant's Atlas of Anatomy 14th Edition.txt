 Dr. J.C. Boileau Grant in his of ce, McMurrich Building, University of 
Toronto, 1946. Through his textbooks, Dr. Grant made an indelible 
impression on the teaching of anatomy throughout the world. 
(Courtesy of Dr. C. G. Smith.) 
 The life of Dr. J.C. Boileau Grant has been likened to the course of the 
seventh cranial nerve as it passes out of the skull: complicated but 
purposeful. 1 He was born in the parish of Lasswade in Edinburgh, 
Scotland, on February 6, 1886. Dr. Grant studied medicine at the 
University of Edinburgh from 1903 to 1908. Here, his skill as a 
dissector in the laboratory of the renowned anatomist, Dr. Daniel 
John Cunningham (1850–1909), earned him a number of awards. 
 Following graduation, Dr. Grant was appointed the resident 
house of cer at the In rmary in Whitehaven, Cumberland. From 
1909 to 1911, Dr. Grant demonstrated anatomy in the University 
of Edinburgh, followed by 2 years at the University of Durham, at 
Newcastle-on-Tyne in England, in the laboratory of Professor Robert 
Howden, editor of  Gray’s Anatomy . 
 With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Dr. Grant joined 
the Royal Army Medical Corps and served with distinction. He was 
mentioned in dispatches in September 1916, received the Military 
Cross in September 1917 for “conspicuous gallantry and devotion 
to duty during attack,” and received a bar to the Military Cross in 
August 1918. 1 
 In October 1919, released from the Royal Army, he accepted 
the position of Professor of Anatomy at the University of Manitoba 
in Winnipeg, Canada. With the frontline medical practitioner in 
mind, he endeavored to “bring up a generation of surgeons who 
knew exactly what they were doing once an operation had begun.” 1 
Devoted to research and learning, Dr. Grant took interest in other 
projects, such as performing anthropometric studies of Indian tribes 
in northern Manitoba during the 1920s. In Winnipeg, Dr. Grant met 
Catriona Christie, whom he married in 1922. 
 Dr. Grant was known for his reliance on logic, analysis, and 
deduction as opposed to rote memory. While at the University of 
Manitoba, Dr. Grant began writing  A Method of Anatomy, Descriptive 
and Deductive , which was published in 1937. 2 
 In 1930, Dr. Grant accepted the position of Chair of Anatomy 
at the University of Toronto. He stressed the value of a “clean” 
dissection, with the structures well de ned. This required the delicate 
touch of a sharp scalpel, and students soon learned that a dull tool 
was anathema. Instructive dissections were made available in the 
Anatomy Museum, a means of student review on which Dr. Grant 
placed a high priority. Illustrations of these actual dissections are 
included in  Grant’s Atlas of Anatomy . 
 The  rst edition of the  Atlas , published in 1943, was the  rst 
anatomical atlas to be published in North America. 3  Grant’s Dissector 
preceded the  Atlas in 1940. 4 
 Dr. Grant remained at the University of Toronto until his retirement 
in 1956. At that time, he became Curator of the Anatomy Museum in 
the University. He also served as Visiting Professor of Anatomy at the 
University of California at Los Angeles, where he taught for 10 years. 
 Dr. Grant died in 1973 of cancer. Through his teaching method, 
still presented in the Grant’s textbooks, Dr. Grant’s life interest—
human anatomy—lives on. In their eulogy, colleagues and friends 
Ross MacKenzie and J. S. Thompson said, “Dr. Grant’s knowledge 
of anatomical fact was encyclopedic, and he enjoyed nothing better 
than sharing his knowledge with others, whether they were junior 
students or senior staff. While somewhat strict as a teacher, his quiet 
wit and boundless humanity never failed to impress. He was, in the 
very  nest sense, a scholar and a gentleman.” 1

 This edition of  Grant’s Atlas has, like its predecessors, required 
intense research, market input, and creativity. It is not enough to 
rely on a solid reputation; with each new edition, we have adapted 
and changed many aspects of the  Atlas while maintaining the 
commitment to pedagogical excellence and anatomical realism 
that has enriched its long history. Medical and health sciences 
education, and the role of anatomy instruction and application 
within it, continually evolve to re ect new teaching approaches and 
educational models. The health care system itself is changing, and 
the skills and knowledge that future health care practitioners must 
master are changing along with it. Finally, technologic advances in 
publishing, particularly in online resources and electronic media, 
have transformed the way students access content and the methods 
by which educators teach content. All of these developments have 
shaped the vision and directed the execution of this fourteenth 
edition of  Grant’s Atlas , as evidenced by the following key features. 
 Recolorization of the orig inal carbon-dust  Gra nt’s Atla s 
 im ag es from  hig h-resolution scans. The entire collection of 
carbon-dust illustrations were remastered and recolored for the 
fourteenth edition using a vibrant new palette. The stunning detail 
and contrast of the original Grant’s art was maintained while adding 
a new level of luminosity of organs and especially transparency of 
tissues, enabling demonstrations of deeper relationships not possible 
with merely recolored grayscale illustrations, thereby enhancing 
the student learning experience. The student is able to visualize 
and appreciate clearly the newly revealed relationships between 
structures, enabling the formation of three-dimensional (3D) 
constructs for each region of the body. The recolorization, enabled 
by modern image processing, allows reproduction and viewing of 
the images—both in print and electronically—with unprecedented 
high resolution and  delity, continuing their vital role informing 
future generations of medical and health care providers about the 
structure and function of the human body. 
 A unique feature of  Grant’s Atlas is that rather than providing an 
idealized view of human anatomy, the classic illustrations represent 
actual dissections that the student can directly compare with 
specimens in the lab. Because the original models used for these 
illustrations were real cadavers, the accuracy of these illustrations 
is unparalleled, offering students the best introduction to anatomy 
possible. 
 Schem atic illustrations. Updated for the fourteenth edition 
with a modern uniform style and consistent color palette, the full-
color schematic illustrations and orientation  gures supplement 
the dissection  gures to clarify anatomical concepts, show the 
relationships of structures, and give an overview of the body region 
being studied. 
 The illustrations conform to Dr. Grant’s admonition to “keep 
it simple”: Extraneous labels were deleted, and some labels were 
added to identify key structures and make the illustrations as useful 
as possible to students. 
 Leg ends w ith easy-to- nd clinical applications. Admittedly, 
artwork is the focus of any atlas; however, the  Grant’s legends have 
long been considered a unique and valuable feature of the  Atlas . 
The observations and comments that accompany the illustrations 
assist orientation and draw attention to salient points and signi cant 
structures that might otherwise escape notice. Their purpose is to 
interpret the illustrations without providing exhaustive description. 
Readability, clarity, and practicality were emphasized in the editing of 
this edition. Clinical comments, which deliver practical “pearls” that 
link anatomical features with their signi cance in health care practice, 
appear in blue text within the  gure legends. New clinical comments 
based on current practices have been added in this edition, providing 
even more relevance for students searching for medical application of 
anatomical concepts. 
 Enhanced diag nostic im ag ing  and surface anatom y. 
Because medical imaging has taken on increased importance in 
the diagnosis and treatment of injuries and illnesses, diagnostic 
images are used liberally throughout and at the end of each 
chapter. Over 100 clinically signi cant magnetic resonance images 
(MRIs), computed tomography (CT) scans, ultrasound scans, and 
corresponding orientation drawings are included, many of which 
are new to or updated for this edition. Labeled surface anatomy 
photographs which, like the illustrations, feature ethnic diversity 
continue to be an important feature in this new edition. 
 Updated and im proved tables. Tables help students 
organize complex information in an easy-to-use format ideal for 
review and study. In addition to muscles, tables summarizing nerves, 
arteries, and other relevant structures are included. Tables are made 
more meaningful with illustrations strategically placed on the same 
page, demonstrating the structures and relationships described in 
the tables. 
 Log ical org anization and layout. The organization and 
layout of the  Atlas have always been determined with ease of use 
as the goal. In this edition, to facilitate dissection, the body regions 
have been reordered in the same sequence as the more recent and 
current editions of  Grant’s Dissector . The order of plates within every 
chapter was scrutinized to ensure that it is logical and pedagogically 
effective. 
 We hope that you enjoy using this fourteenth edition of  Grant’s 
Atlas and that it becomes a trusted partner in your educational 
experience. We believe that this new edition safeguards the  Atlas’s 
historical strengths while enhancing its usefulness to today’s 
students.

Preface

x
 The principal illustrations for  Grant’s Atlas , created in the 1940s and 
1950s, use classic techniques of carbon dust or wash in pure grayscale. 
Although the detail of the grayscale carbon-dust illustrations was 
outstanding (see below  gure on the left), the need for color was 
soon obvious. Early editions of the  Atlas layered solid colors over parts 
of the grayscale artwork to highlight the presence and relationships of 
important structures such as veins, arteries, and nerves. This didactic 
approach and technology persisted throughout the  rst eight editions. 
 In the early 1990s, the  Atlas was revised using a complex pre-
digital technique where the original illustrations were photographed 
and printed on photographic paper. The prints were then colorized 
by hand with photo dyes, and the resulting colored prints were 
rephotographed for reproduction in print. Although this process 
resulted in a signi cant enrichment of the illustrations, the technique 
sometimes led to loss of detail and reduction of contrast. Over the 
next several editions, the color of the digital images were adjusted 
and enhanced (see below  gure in the middle). 
 In the late 1990s, the University of Toronto assumed care of 
the original illustrations. The illustrations had been handled roughly 
over their long lives and were in many cases deteriorating due to 
their non-archival substrates. In 2008, an interdisciplinary team 1 
of communications scholars, illustrators, and archivists applied for 
and received funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities 
Research Council of Canada to study the illustrations and to create 
a digital archive of the corpus. The team catalogued, documented, 
and scanned the artifacts at high resolution. The effort revealed a 
number of “lost” illustrations among the more than 1,000 images. 
Some of these images have been restored to the current edition. 
 Once the database of high-resolution images was compiled, the 
possibility arose to “remaster” and recolor the images for the next 
edition of  Grant’s Atlas . A system was set up to clean the images and 
create new layers of color. 
 • Almost all of the original illustrations contained hand-
lettered labels and leader lines that had to be removed. This 
was accomplished by the careful use of digital cloning and 
retouching tools. 
 • The tonal range and contrast was adjusted to maximize 
clarity and dynamic range. 
 • A series of color layers were added over the cleaned scans, 
based on a carefully chosen palette. Most layers were set to 
the color transfer mode, which was chosen to assure that 
the grayscale balance of the underlying scans would not be 
altered. 
 • All of the recolored illustrations went through numerous 
rounds of revision with the authors to assure accuracy and 
re ect the pedagogic needs of the new edition. 
 This work was overseen by Nicholas Woolridge and carried 
out by two graduates of the Master of Science in Biomedical 
Communications (MScBMC) program: Nicole Clough and Marissa 
Webber. The retouching process was designed to preserve the detail, 
texture, and contrast of the original artwork (see below image on 
the right), allowing the illustrations to continue informing students 
about the structure and function of the human body for decades to 
come.

 Starting with the  rst edition of  Grant’s  Atlas published in 1943, 
many people have given generously of their talents and expertise and 
we acknowledge their participation with heartfelt gratitude. Most of 
the original carbon-dust halftones on which this book is based were 
created by Dorothy Foster Chubb, a pupil of Max Brödel and one 
of Canada’s  rst professionally trained medical illustrators. She was 
later joined by Nancy Joy. Mrs. Chubb was mainly responsible for 
the artwork of the  rst two editions and the sixth edition; Professor 
Joy, for those in between. In subsequent editions, additional line and 
halftone illustrations by Elizabeth Blackstock, Elia Hopper Ross, and 
Marguerite Drummond were added. In recent editions, the artwork 
of Valerie Oxorn and the surface anatomy photography of Anne 
Rayner of Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Medical Art Group 
have augmented the modern look and feel of the atlas. 
 Much credit is also due to Charles E. Storton for his role 
in the preparation of the majority of the original dissections and 
preliminary photographic work. We also wish to acknowledge the 
work of Dr. James Anderson, a pupil of Dr. Grant, under whose 
stewardship the seventh and eighth editions were published. 
 The following individuals also provided invaluable contributions 
to previous editions of the atlas and are gratefully acknowledged:

•  The vertebral column usually consists of 24 separate (presa-
cral) vertebrae, 5 fused vertebrae in the sacrum, and variably 
4 fused or separated coccygeal vertebrae. Of the 24 separate 
vertebrae, 12 support the ribs (thoracic vertebrae), 7 are in the 
neck (cervical vertebrae, and 5 are in the lumbar region (lum-
bar vertebrae).
•  The spinal nerves exit the vertebral (spinal) canal via the inter-
vertebral (IV) foramina. There are 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lum-
bar, 5 sacral, and 1 to 2 coccygeal spinal nerves.
B. Homologous parts of vertebrae.  A rib is a free costal element in 
the thoracic region; in the cervical and lumbar regions, it is rep-
resented by the anterior part of a transverse process, and in the 
sacrum, by the anterior part of the lateral mass.

A. Fetus. Note the C-shaped curvature of the fetal spine, which is 
concave anteriorly over its entire length. B. Development of the 
vertebrae. At birth, a vertebra consists of three bony parts (two 
halves of the neural arch and the centrum) united by hyaline car-
tilage. At age 2, the halves of each neural arch begin to fuse, pro-
ceeding from the lumbar to the cervical region; at approximately 
age 7, the arches begin to fuse to the centrum, proceeding from 
the cervical to lumbar regions. C. Adult. The four curvatures of the 
adult vertebral column include the cervical lordosis, which is con-
vex anteriorly and lies between vertebrae C1 and T2; the thoracic 
kyphosis, which is concave anteriorly, between vertebrae T2 and 
T12; the lumbar lordosis, convex anteriorly and lying between T12 
and the lumbosacral joint; and the sacrococcygeal kyphosis, con-
cave anteriorly and spanning from the lumbosacral joint to the tip 
of the coccyx. The anteriorly concave thoracic kyphosis and sacro-
coccygeal kyphosis are primary curves, and the anteriorly convex 
cervical lordosis and lumbar lordosis are secondary curves that 
develop after birth. The cervical lordosis develops when the child 
begins to hold the head up, and the lumbar kyphosis develops 
when the child begins to walk.

• In the thoracic and lumbar regions, the articular processes/
facets lie posterior to the vertebral bodies and in the cervical 
region posterolateral to the bodies. Superior articular facets in 
the cervical region face mainly superiorly, in the thoracic region, 
mainly posteriorly, and in the lumbar region, mainly medially. 
The change in direction is gradual from cervical to thoracic but 
abrupt from thoracic to lumbar.
• Although movements between adjacent vertebrae are relatively 
small, the summation of all the small movements produces a 
considerable range of movement of the vertebral column as a 
whole.
•  Movements of the vertebral column are freer (have greater 
range of motion) in the cervical and lumbar regions than in the 
thoracic region. Lateral bending is freest in the cervical and lum-
bar regions;  exion is greatest in the cervical region; extension is 
most marked in the lumbar region, but the interlocking articular 
processes prevent rotation.
•  The thoracic region is most stable because of the external sup-
port gained from the articulations of the ribs and costal cartilages 
with the sternum. The direction of the articular facets permits 
rotation, but  exion, extension, and lateral bending are severely 
restricted.

The range of movement of the vertebral column is limited by the 
thickness, elasticity, and compressibility of the IV discs; shape and 
orientation of the zygapophysial joints; tension of the joint capsules 
of the zygapophysial joints; resistance of the ligaments and back mus-
cles; connection to thoracic (rib) cage and bulk of surrounding tissue.

A. Disarticulated cervical vertebrae.  The bodies of the cervi-
cal vertebrae can be dislocated in neck injuries with less force 
than is required to fracture them. Because of the large vertebral 
canal in the cervical region, some dislocation can occur without 
damaging the spinal cord. When a cervical vertebra is severely 
dislocated, it injures the spinal cord. If the dislocation does not 
result in “facet jumping” with locking of the displaced articu-
lar processes, the cervical vertebrae may self-reduce (“slip back 
into place”) so that a radiograph may not indicate that the cord 
has been injured. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may re-
veal the resulting soft tissue damage.
Aging of the IV disc combined with the changing shape of 
the vertebrae results in an increase in compressive forces at the 
periphery of the vertebral bodies, where the disc attaches. In 
response, osteophytes (bony spurs) commonly develop around 
the margins of the vertebral body, especially along the outer 
attachment of the IV disc. Similarly, as altered mechanics 
place greater stresses on the zygapophysial joints, osteophytes 
develop along the attachments of the joint capsules, especially 
those of the superior articular process.

shaped lateral masses, connected by relatively thin anterior and 
posterior arches and the transverse ligament of the atlas (see 
Figs. 1.12A and C). Vertical forces (e.g., striking the head on bot-
tom of pool) may force the lateral masses apart fracturing one or 
both of the anterior or posterior arches. If the force is suf cient, 
rupture of the transverse ligament of the atlas will also occur.

Fracture of thoracic vertebrae. Although the characteristics of 
the superior aspect of vertebra T12 are distinctly thoracic, its infe-
rior aspect has lumbar characteristics for articulation with vertebra 
L1. The abrupt transition allowing primarily rotational movements 
with vertebra T11 while disallowing rotational movements with 
vertebral L1 makes vertebra T12 especially susceptible to fracture.

A laminectomy is the surgical excision of one or more spinous 
processes and their supporting laminae in a particular region 
of the vertebral column by transecting the interarticular part 
(Fig. 1.13G, 1). The term is also commonly used to denote the 
removal of most of the vertebral arch by transecting the pedi-
cles (Fig. 1.13G, 2). Laminectomies provide access to the verte-
bral canal to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots, 
commonly caused by a tumor or herniated IV disc.

of the  bers in the concentric layers of the anulus. Note that the 
IV discs form the inferior half of the anterior boundary of the IV 
foramen. B. Innervation of zygapophysial joints and the anulus 
 brosus of IV discs.
When the zygapophysial joints are injured or develop os-
teophytes during aging (osteoarthritis), the related spinal nerves 
are affected. This causes pain along the distribution pattern of 
the dermatomes and spasm in the muscles derived from the 
associated myotomes. Denervation of lumbar zygapophysial 
joints is a procedure that may be used for treatment of back 
pain caused by disease of these joints. The denervation process 
is directed at the articular branches of two adjacent posterior 
rami of the spinal nerves because each joint receives innervation 
from both the nerve exiting that level and the superjacent nerve.

• The anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments are ligaments 
of the vertebral bodies; the ligamenta  ava are ligaments of the 
vertebral arches.
• The anterior longitudinal ligament consists of broad, strong, 
 brous bands that are attached to the IV discs and vertebral 
bodies anteriorly and are perforated by the foramina for arteries 
and veins passing to and from the vertebral bodies.
• The ligamenta  ava, composed of elastic  bers, extend between 
adjacent laminae and converge in the median plane. They extend 
laterally to blend with the joint capsule of the zygapophysial 
joints.

The nucleus pulposus of the normal disc between vertebrae L2 
and L3 has been removed from the enclosing anulus  brosus. The 
bursa between L3 and L4 spines is presumably the result of habitual 
hyperextension, which brings the lumbar spines into contact.
The nucleus pulposus of the disc between L1 and L2 has her-
niated posteriorly through the anulus. Herniation or protrusion 
of the gelatinous nucleus pulposus into or through the anulus 
 brosus is a well-recognized cause of low back and lower limb 
pain. If degeneration of the posterior longitudinal ligament and 
wearing of the anulus  brosus has occurred, the nucleus pulposus 
may herniate into the vertebral canal and compress the spinal cord 
or nerve roots of spinal nerves in the cauda equina. Herniations 
usually occur posterolaterally, where the anulus is relatively thin 
and does not receive support from the ligaments.

The anterior sacro-iliac ligament is part of the  brous capsule of the 
sacro-iliac joint anteriorly and spans between the lateral aspect of 
the sacrum and the ilium, anterior to the auricular surfaces.
During pregnancy, the pelvic joints and ligaments relax, and 
pelvic movements increase. The sacro-iliac interlocking mechanism 
is less effective because the relaxation permits greater rotation of 
the pelvis and contributes to the lordotic posture often assumed 
during pregnancy with the change in the center of gravity. Relax-
ation of the sacro-iliac joints and pubic symphysis permits as much 
as 10% to 15% increase in diameters (mostly transverse), facilitat-
ing passage of the fetus through the pelvic canal. The coccyx is 
also allowed to move posteriorly.

• The sacrotuberous ligaments attach the sacrum, ilium, and coc-
cyx to the ischial tuberosity; the sacrospinous ligaments unite 
the sacrum and coccyx to the ischial spine. The sacrotuberous 
and sacrospinous ligaments convert the sciatic notches of the 
hip bones into greater and lesser sciatic foramina.
• The  bers of the posterior sacro-iliac ligament vary in obliquity; 
the superior  bers are shorter and lie between the ilium and 
superior part of the sacrum; the longer, obliquely oriented 
inferior  bers span between the posterior superior iliac spine and 
the inferior part of the sacrum.
•  The iliolumbar ligaments unite the ilia and transverse processes 
of L5.

both sides. The left rhomboid muscles have been re ected, allowing 
the vertebral border of the scapula to be raised from the thoracic 
wall. The serratus posterior superior and inferior form the intermedi-
ate layer of muscles, passing from the vertebral spines to the ribs; the 
two muscles slope in opposite directions and are accessory muscles 
of respiration. The thoracolumbar fascia extends laterally to the an-
gles of the ribs, becoming thin superiorly and passing deep to the 
serratus posterior superior muscle. The fascia gives attachment to the 
latissimus dorsi and serratus posterior inferior muscles (see Fig. 1.30).

The right erector spinae muscles are in situ, lying between the 
spinous processes medially and the angles of the ribs laterally. 
The erector spinae are split into three longitudinal columns: 
iliocostalis laterally, longissimus in the middle, and spinalis 
medially. The left longissimus muscle is pulled laterally to show 
the insertion into the transverse processes and ribs; not shown 
here are its extensions to the neck and head, longissimus cervicis 
and capitis.

• The semispinalis, multi dus, and rotatores muscles constitute 
the transversospinalis group of deep muscles. In general, their 
bundles pass obliquely in a superomedial direction, from trans-
verse processes to spinous processes in successively deeper 
layers. The bundles of semispinalis span approximately  ve 
interspaces, those of multi dus, approximately three, and those 
of rotatores, one or two.
•  The semispinalis (thoracis, cervicis, and capitis) muscles span the 
lower thoracic region to the cranium.
• The multi dus muscle extends from the sacrum to the spinous 
process of the axis. In the lumbosacral region, it emerges from the 
aponeurosis of the erector spinae and extends from the sacrum, 
and mammillary processes of the lumbar vertebrae, to insert into 
spinous processes approximately three segments higher.

• Of the three layers of transversospinalis muscles, the rotatores are 
the deepest and shortest. They pass from the root of one transverse 
process superomedially to the junction of the transverse process and 
lamina of the vertebra above. Rotatores longus span two vertebrae.
• The levatores costarum pass from the tip of one transverse process 
inferiorly to the rib below (brevis); some span two ribs (longus).
• The posterior ramus passes posterior to the superior costotrans-
verse ligament.
• The lateral costotransverse ligament is strong and joins the 
tubercle of the rib to the tip of the transverse process. It forms 
the posterior aspect of the joint capsule of the costotransverse 
joint.

• The left muscles are seen in their fascial sheaths or compart-
ments; the right muscles have been removed from their sheaths.
• The aponeurosis of transversus abdominis and posterior aponeu-
rosis of internal oblique muscles split into two strong sheets, the 
middle and posterior layers of thoracolumbar fascia. The anterior 
layer of thoracolumbar fascia is the deep fascia of the quadra-
tus lumborum (quadratus lumborum fascia). The posterior layer 
of the thoracolumbar fascia provides proximal attachment for 
the latissimus dorsi muscle and, at a higher level, the serratus 
posterior inferior muscle.
Back strain is a common back problem that usually results from 
extreme movements of the vertebral column, such as extension 
or rotation. Back strain refers to some stretching or microscopic 
tearing of muscle  bers and/or ligaments of the back. The muscles 
usually involved are those producing movements of the lumbar IV 
joints.

• The semispinalis capitis, the great extensor muscle of the 
head and neck, forms the posterior wall of the suboccipital 
region. It is pierced by the greater occipital nerve (posterior 
ramus of C2) and has free medial and lateral borders at this 
level.
• The greater occipital nerve, when followed caudally, leads 
to the inferior border of the obliquus capitis inferior muscle, 
around which it turns. Following the inferior border of the 
obliquus capitis inferior muscle medially from the nerve leads 
to the spinous process of the axis; followed laterally, this leads 
to the transverse process of the atlas.

• The conus medullaris continues as a glistening thread, the  lum terminale in-
ternum, which descends with the nerve roots, constituting the cauda equina.
• In the adult, the spinal cord usually ends at the level of the disc between 
vertebrae L1 and L2. Variations: 95% of cords end within the limits of the 
bodies of L1 and L2, whereas 3% end posterior to the inferior half of T12, 
and 2% posterior to L3.
To obtain a sample of CSF from the lumbar cistern, a lumbar puncture nee-
dle,  tted with a stylet, is inserted into the subarachnoid space. Flexion of the 
vertebral column facilitates insertion of the needle by stretching the ligamenta 
 ava and spreading the laminae and spinous processes apart. The needle is 
inserted in the midline between the spinous processes of the L3 and L4 (or 
the L4 and L5) vertebrae. At these levels in adults, there is little danger of 
damaging the spinal cord.

•  The thoracic sympathetic trunk and ganglia lie lateral to the tho-
racic vertebrae; the rami communicantes connect the sympa-
thetic ganglia with the spinal nerve.
•  A sleeve of dura mater surrounds the spinal nerves and blends 
with the sheath (epineurium) of the spinal nerve.

B. Arterial supply and venous drainage. C. Segmental medullary 
and radicular arteries. 
•  The spinal arteries run longitudinally from the brainstem to 
the conus medullaris of the spinal cord. By themselves, the 
anterior and posterior spinal arteries supply only the short 
superior part of the spinal cord. 
•  The anterior and posterior segmental medullary arteries 
enter the IV foramen to unite with the spinal arteries to sup-
ply blood to the spinal cord. The great anterior segmental 
medullary artery (Adamkiewicz artery) occurs on the left side 
in 65% of people. It reinforces the circulation to two thirds of 
the spinal cord.
•  Posterior and anterior roots of the spinal nerves and their 
coverings are supplied by posterior and anterior radicular 
arteries, which run along the nerve roots. These vessels do 
not reach the posterior or anterior spinal arteries.
•  The anterior and posterior spinal veins are arranged longi-
tudinally; they communicate freely with each other and are 
drained by anterior and posterior medullary and radicular 
veins. The veins draining the spinal cord join the internal ver-
tebral plexus in the epidural space. 
Ischemia. De ciency of blood supply (ischemia) of the spinal 
cord can lead to muscle weakness and paralysis. The spinal cord 
may also suffer circulatory impairment if the segmental medul-
lary arteries, particularly the great anterior segmental medullary 
artery (of Adamkiewicz), are narrowed by obstructive arterial 
disease or aortic clamping during surgery.

• There are internal and external vertebral venous plexuses, 
communicating with each other and with both systemic veins 
and the portal system. Infection and tumors can spread 
from the areas drained by the systemic and portal veins to the 
vertebral venous system and lodge in the vertebrae, spinal 
cord, brain, or skull.
• The internal vertebral venous plexus, located in the verte-
bral canal, consists of a plexus of thin-walled, valveless veins 
that surround the dura mater. Cranially, the internal venous 
plexus communicates through the foramen magnum with 
the occipital and basilar sinuses; at each spinal segment, the 
plexus receives veins from the spinal cord and a basiverte-
bral vein from the vertebral body. The plexus is drained by IV 
veins that pass through the intervertebral and sacral foramina 
to the vertebral, intercostal, lumbar, and lateral sacral veins.
• The anterior external vertebral venous plexus is formed by 
veins that course through the body of each vertebra. Veins 
that pass through the ligamenta  ava form the posterior 
external vertebral venous plexus. In the cervical region, these 
plexuses communicate with the occipital and deep cervical 
veins. In the thoracic, lumbar, and pelvic regions, the azygos 
(or hemi-azygos), ascending lumbar, and lateral sacral veins, 
respectively, further link segment to segment.

• Early in development, the spinal cord and vertebral (spinal) 
canal are nearly equal in length. The canal grows longer, so spi-
nal nerves have an increasingly longer course to reach the IV fo-
ramen at the correct level for their exit. The spinal cord of adults 
terminates between vertebral bodies L1–L2. The remaining 
spinal nerves, seeking their IV foramen of exit, form the cauda 
equina.
•  All 31 pairs of spinal nerves—8 cervical (C), 12 thoracic (T), 
5 lumbar (L), 5 sacral (S), and 1 coccygeal (Co)—arise from the 
spinal cord and exit through the IV foramina in the vertebral 
column.

Somatic motor (general somatic efferent)  bers transmit impulses 
to skeletal (voluntary) muscles. The unilateral muscle mass receiving 
innervation from the somatic motor  bers conveyed by a single spi-
nal nerve is a myotome. Each skeletal muscle is innervated by the 
somatic motor  bers of several spinal nerves; therefore, the muscle 
myotome will consist of several segments. The muscle myotomes 
have been grouped by joint movement to facilitate clinical testing. 
The intrinsic muscles of the hand constitute a single myotome—T1.

A. Schematic illustration.  Visceral afferent  bers have important 
relationships to the central nervous system (CNS), both ana-
tomically and functionally. We are usually unaware of the sensory 
input of these  bers, which provides information about the con-
dition of the body’s internal environment. This information is in-
tegrated in the CNS, often triggering visceral or somatic re exes 
or both. Visceral re exes regulate blood pressure and chemistry 
by altering such functions as heart and respiratory rates and vas-
cular resistance. Visceral sensation that reaches a conscious level 
is generally categorized as pain that is usually poorly localized 
and may be perceived as hunger or nausea. However, adequate 
stimulation may elicit true pain. Most visceral/re ex (uncon-
scious) sensation and some pain travel in visceral afferent  bers 
that accompany the parasympathetic  bers retrograde. Most vis-
ceral pain impulses (from the heart and most organs of the peri-
toneal cavity) travel along visceral afferent  bers accompanying 
sympathetic  bers.
Visceral efferent (motor) innervation.  The efferent nerve  bers 
and ganglia of the ANS are organized into two systems or divisions.
1. Sympathetic (thoracolumbar) division. In general, the effects 
of sympathetic stimulation are catabolic (preparing the body 
for “ ight or  ght”).
2. Parasympathetic (craniosacral) division. In general, the 
effects of parasympathetic stimulation are anabolic (promoting 
normal function and conserving energy).
Conduction of impulses from the CNS to the effector organ 
involves a series of two neurons in both sympathetic and parasym-
pathetic systems. The cell body of the presynaptic (preganglionic) 
neuron ( rst neuron) is located in the gray matter of the CNS. Its 
 ber (axon) synapses on the cell body of a postsynaptic (postgan-
glionic) neuron, the second neuron in the series. The cell bodies of 
such second neurons are located in autonomic ganglia outside the 
CNS, and the postsynaptic  bers terminate on the effector organ 
(smooth muscle, modi ed cardiac muscle, or glands).

Fibers involved in providing sympathetic innervation to the body 
wall and limbs or viscera above the level of the diaphragm follow 
paths 1 to 3. They synapse in the paravertebral ganglia of the sym-
pathetic trunks. Fibers involved in innervating abdominopelvic 
viscera follow path 4 to prevertebral ganglion via abdominopelvic 
splanchnic nerves. Postsynaptic  bers usually do not ascend or de-
scend within the sympathetic trunks, exiting at the level of synapse.

A. Upper limb bones at birth. Only the diaphyses of the long bones and scapula are ossi ed. 
The epiphyses, carpal bones, coracoid process, medial border of the scapula, and acromion 
are still cartilaginous. B–I. Sites of epiphyses (darker orange regions). The ends of the long 
bones are ossi ed by the formation of one or more secondary centers of ossi cation; these 
epiphyses develop from birth to approximately 20 years of age in the clavicle, humerus, 
radius, ulna, metacarpals, and phalanges.
Epiphyses. Without knowledge of bone growth and the appearance of bones in radio-
graphic and other diagnostic images at various ages, a displaced epiphysial plate could be 
mistaken for a fracture, and separation of an epiphysis could be interpreted as a displaced 
piece of fractured bone. Knowledge of the patient’s age and the location of epiphyses can 
prevent these errors.

J. Ossi cation of bones of hand. Note the phalanges have a single 
proximal epiphysis and metacarpals 2, 3, 4, and 5 have single dis-
tal epiphyses. The 1st metacarpal behaves as a phalanx by having 
proximal epiphysis. Short-lived epiphyses may appear at the other 
ends of metacarpals 1 and/or 2. There are individual and gender 
differences in sequence and timing of ossi cation. K. Sequence of 
ossi cation of carpal bones. L. Radiographs of stages of ossi cation 
of wrist and hand. A 2½ -year-old child (top); the lunate is ossifying, 
and the distal radial epiphysis (R) is present (C, capitate; H, hamate; 
L, lunate; Tq, triquetrum). An 11-year-old child (bottom). All carpal 
bones are ossi ed (S, scaphoid; Td, trapezoid; Tz, trapezium; arrow-
head, pisiform), and the distal epiphysis of the ulna (U) has ossi ed.

OVERVIEW OF MOTOR 
INNERVATION OF 
UPPER LIMB (continued )
A. Musculocutaneous and median 
nerves. The musculocutaneous nerve 
innervates all the muscles of the an-
terior compartment of the arm. The 
median nerve innervates muscles 
of the anterior compartment of the 
forearm (with 1½  exceptions that 
are innervated by the ulnar nerve), 
the lumbricals to digits 2 and 3, and 
the intrinsic muscles of the thumb 
(thenar muscles). B. Ulnar nerve. 
The ulnar nerve innervates the  exor 
carpi ulnaris and ulnar half of the 
 exor digitorum profundus in the 
forearm, the hypothenar and inter-
osseous muscles of the hand, the 
lumbricals to digits 3 and 4, and 
1½  thenar muscles (adductor polli-
cis and the deep head of the  exor 
pollicis brevis). C. Radial nerve. The 
radial nerve innervates all muscles of 
the posterior compartments of the 
arm and forearm.

Myotomes. Somatic motor (general somatic efferent)  bers 
transmit impulses to skeletal (voluntary) muscles. The unilateral 
muscle mass receiving information from the somatic motor 
 bers conveyed by a single spinal nerve is a myotome. The 
movements associated with each bolded segment in Table 2.2 
are most commonly tested to determine the neurologic level 
of a lesion. Myotatic re exes. A myotatic re ex (deep tendon 
or stretch re ex) is an involuntary contraction of a muscle in 
response to sudden stretching. Myotatic re exes are elicited by 
briskly tapping the tendon with a re ex hammer. Each tendon 
re ex is mediated by speci c spinal nerves. Stretch re exes con-
trol muscle tone.

Two different dermatome maps are commonly used. A. and B. 
The dermatome pattern according to Foerster (1933) is preferred 
by many because of its correlation with clinical  ndings. In the 
Foerster schema, dermatomes C6–T1 are displaced from the trunk 
to limbs. C. and D. The dermatome pattern according to Keegan 
and Garrett (1948) is preferred by others for its correlation with 
development. Although depicted as distinct zones, adjacent der-
matomes overlap considerably except along the axial line.

A. The arteries often anastomose or communicate to form net-
works to ensure blood supply distal to the joint throughout the 
range of movement.
Arterial occlusion. If a main channel is occluded, the smaller 
alternate channels can usually increase in size, providing a col-
lateral circulation that ensures the blood supply to structures 
distal to the blockage. However, collateral pathways require 
time to develop; they are usually insuf cient to compensate for 
sudden occlusions.

Super cial lymphatic vessels arise from lymphatic plexuses in the 
digits, palm, and dorsum of the hand and ascend with the su-
per cial veins of the upper limb. The super cial lymphatic vessels 
ascend through the forearm and arm, converging toward the ce-
phalic and especially to the basilic vein to reach the axillary lymph 
nodes. Some lymph passes through the cubital nodes at the elbow 
and the deltopectoral (infraclavicular) nodes at the shoulder. Deep 
lymphatic vessels accompany the neurovascular bundles of the 
upper limb and end primarily in the humeral (lateral) and central 
axillary lymph nodes.

Because of the prominence and accessibility of the super cial 
veins, they are commonly used for venipuncture (puncture of a 
vein to draw blood or inject a solution). By applying a tourniquet 
to the arm, the venous return is occluded, and the veins distend 
and usually are visible and/or palpable. Once a vein is punctured, 
the tourniquet is removed so that when the needle is removed the 
vein will not bleed extensively. The median cubital vein is com-
monly used for venipuncture. The veins forming the dorsal venous 
network of the hand and the cephalic and basilic veins arising from 
it are commonly used for long-term introduction of  uids (intra-
venous feeding). The cubital veins are also a site for the introduc-
tion of cardiac catheters to secure blood samples from the great 
vessels and chambers of the heart.

B. Clavipectoral fascia. The clavipectoral fascia extends from the 
axillary fascia to enclose the pectoralis minor and subclavius mus-
cles and then attaches to the clavicle. The part of the clavipec-
toral fascia superior to the pectoralis minor is the costocoracoid 
membrane, and the part of the clavipectoral fascia inferior to the 
pectoralis minor is the suspensory ligament of the axilla. The sus-
pensory ligament of the axilla, an extension of the axillary fascia, 
supports the axillary fascia and pulls the axillary fascia and the skin 
inferior to it superiorly when the arm is abducted, forming the axil-
lary fossa or “armpit.”

A. Brachial fascia. The brachial fascia is the deep fascia of the arm 
and is continuous superiorly with the pectoral and axillary layers 
of fascia. Medial and lateral intermuscular septa extend from the 
deep aspect of the brachial fascia to the humerus, dividing the 
arm into anterior and posterior musculofascial compartments. 
B. Antebrachial fascia. The antebrachial fascia surrounds the fore-
arm and is continuous with the brachial fascia and deep fascia of 
the hand. The interosseous membrane separates the forearm into 
anterior and posterior musculofascial compartments. Distally, the 
fascia thickens to form the palmar carpal ligament, which is con-
tinuous with the  exor retinaculum and dorsally with the extensor 
expansion. The deep fascia of the hand is continuous with the an-
tebrachial fascia, and on the palmar surface of the hand, it thickens 
to form the palmar aponeurosis. C. Flexor retinaculum (transverse 
carpal ligament). The  exor retinaculum extends between the me-
dial and lateral carpal bones to form the carpal tunnel.

neous and subplatysmal.
• The cephalic vein passes deeply to join the axillary vein in the 
clavipectoral (deltopectoral) triangle.
•  The cutaneous innervation of the pectoral region is by the su-
praclavicular nerves (C3 and C4) and upper thoracic nerves 
(T2–T6); the brachial plexus (C5–T1) does not supply cutaneous 
branches to the pectoral region.

The clavipectoral (deltopectoral) triangle is the depressed area just 
inferior to the lateral part of the clavicle, bounded by the clavicle 
superiorly, the deltoid laterally, and the clavicular head of pectora-
lis major medially. The clavipectoral triangle and the intermuscular 
deltopectoral groove extending from its inferior apex demarcate 
an “internervous plane” (plane not crossed by motor nerves) for an 
anterior or deltopectoral surgical incision to approach the axilla, 
shoulder joint, or proximal humerus.
When the arm is abducted and then adducted against resis-
tance, the two heads of the pectoralis major are visible and pal-
pable. As this muscle extends from the thoracic wall to the arm, it 
forms the anterior axillary fold. Digitations of the serratus anterior 
appear inferolateral to the pectoralis major. The coracoid process 
of the scapula is covered by the anterior part of deltoid; however, 
the tip of the process can be felt on deep palpation in the clavipec-
toral triangle. The deltoid forms the contour of the shoulder.

Origin
Course
Internal thoracic
Subclavian artery
Descends, inclining anteromedially, posterior to sternal end of clavicle and 1st costal carti-
lage; enters thorax to descend in parasternal plane; gives rise to perforating branches, ante-
rior intercostal, musculophrenic, and superior epigastric arteries
Thyrocervical trunk
Ascends as a short, wide trunk, often giving rise to the suprascapular artery and/or cervico-
dorsal trunk and terminating by bifurcating into the ascending cervical and inferior thyroid 
arteries
Suprascapular
Cervicodorsal trunk from thyrocervical trunk (or as direct 
branch of subclavian arterya)
Passes inferolaterally over anterior scalene muscle and phrenic nerve, subclavian artery and 
brachial plexus running laterally posterior and parallel to clavicle; next passes over transverse 
scapular ligament to supraspinous fossa and then lateral to scapular spine (deep to acro-
mion) to infraspinous fossa

• The pectoralis major muscle is re ected, and the clavipectoral 
fascia is removed; the cube of muscle superior to the clavicle is 
cut from the clavicular head of the pectoralis major muscle.
• The subclavius and pectoralis minor are the two deep muscles of 
the anterior wall.
• The second part of the axillary artery passes posterior to the pectoralis 
minor muscle, a  ngerbreadth from the tip of the coracoid process; 
the axillary vein lies anterior and then medial to the axillary artery.
• The median nerve, followed proximally, leads by its lateral root to 
the lateral cord and musculocutaneous nerve and by its medial 
root to the medial cord and ulnar nerve. These four nerves and 
the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm are derived from the 
anterior divisions of the brachial plexus and are raised on a stick. 
The lateral root of the median nerve may occur as several strands.
•  The musculocutaneous nerve enters the  exor compartment of 
the arm by piercing the coracobrachialis muscle.

• The pectoralis major and minor muscles are re ected laterally; 
the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus are re ected 
superiorly; and the arteries, veins, and median and ulnar nerves 
are removed.
• Coracobrachialis arises with the short head of the biceps brachii 
muscle from the tip of the coracoid process and attaches half-
way down the medial aspect of the humerus.
• The musculocutaneous nerve pierces the coracobrachialis mus-
cle and supplies it, the biceps, and the brachialis before becom-
ing the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm.
• The posterior cord of the plexus is formed by the union of the three 
posterior divisions; it supplies the three muscles of the posterior wall 
of the axilla and then bifurcates into the radial and axillary nerves.
•  In the axilla, the radial nerve gives off the nerve to the long head 
of the triceps brachii muscle and a cutaneous branch; in this 
specimen, it also gives off a branch to the medial head of the 
triceps. It then enters the radial groove of the humerus with the 
profunda brachii (deep brachial) artery.
• The axillary nerve passes through the quadrangular space along 
with the posterior circum ex humeral artery. The borders of 
the quadrangular space are superiorly, the lateral border of the 
scapula; inferiorly, the teres major; laterally, the humerus (surgical 
neck); and medially, the long head of triceps brachii. The circum-
 ex scapular artery traverses the triangular interval.

A. The serratus anterior muscle, which forms the medial wall of the axilla, has a 
 eshy belly extending from the superior 8 or 9 ribs in the midclavicular line to the 
medial border of the scapula (B).
Winged scapula. When the serratus anterior is paralyzed because of injury 
to the long thoracic nerve, the medial border of the scapula moves laterally and 
posteriorly, away from the thoracic wall. When the arm is abducted, the medial 
border and the inferior angle of the scapula pull away from the posterior thoracic 
wall, a deformation known as a winged scapula. In addition, the arm cannot be 
abducted above the horizontal position because the serratus anterior is unable to 
rotate the glenoid cavity superiorly.

The superior border of the latissimus dorsi and a part of the rhom-

the superior border of latissimus dorsi, the medial border of the 
scapula, and the inferolateral border of the trapezius is called the 
triangle of auscultation. This gap in the thick back musculature 
is a good place to examine posterior segments of the lungs with 
a stethoscope. When the scapulae are drawn anteriorly by folding 
the arms across the thorax and the trunk is  exed, the auscultatory 
triangle enlarges. The teres major forms a raised oval area on the 
inferolateral third of the posterior aspect of the scapula when the 
arm is adducted against resistance. The posterior axillary fold is 
formed by the teres major and the tendon of the latissimus dorsi.

A. and B. Subscapularis. C. and D. Supraspinatus, infraspinatus, 
and teres minor.
Four of the scapulohumeral muscles (supraspinatus, infraspina-
tus, teres minor, and subscapularis) are called rotator cuff muscles 
because they form a musculotendinous rotator cuff around the 
glenohumeral (shoulder) joint. All except the supraspinatus are ro-
tators of the humerus.

E. Supraspinatus.  The supraspinatus, also part of the rotator cuff, 
initiates and assists the deltoid in abducting the shoulder joint. The 
tendons of the rotator cuff muscles blend with and reinforce the 
joint capsule of the glenohumeral joint, protecting the joint and 
giving it stability.
Injury or disease may damage the rotator cuff, producing in-
stability of the glenohumeral joint. Rupture or tear of the supra-
spinatus tendon is the most common injury of the rotator cuff. 
Degenerative tendinitis of the rotator cuff is common, especially 
in older people.

aCollectively, the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis muscles are referred to as the rotator cuff muscles or “SITS” muscles. They function together during all movements of the shoulder joint 
to hold the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity of scapula.

Fractures of the surgical neck of the humerus are especially 
common in elderly people with osteoporosis (degeneration of 
bone). Even a low energy fall on the hand, with the force being 
transmitted up the forearm bones of the extended limb, may re-
sult in a fracture. Transverse fractures of the shaft of humerus 
frequently result from a direct blow to the arm. Fracture of the 
distal part of the humerus, near the supra-epicondylar ridges, is a 
supra-epicondylar (supracondylar) fracture.

brachii lies in the posterior compartment.
• The medial and lateral intermuscular septum separates these 
two muscle groups.
• The radial nerve and profunda brachii artery and veins serv-
ing the posterior compartment lie in contact with the radial 
groove of the humerus.
• The musculocutaneous nerve serving the anterior compart-
ment lies in the plane between the biceps and the brachialis 
muscles.
• The median nerve crosses to the medial side of the brachial 
artery.
• The ulnar nerve passes posteriorly onto the medial side of the

• When the elbow joint is  exed approximately 90 degrees, the 
biceps is a  exor from the supinated position of the forearm but 
a very powerful supinator from the pronated position.
•  A triangular membranous band, the bicipital aponeurosis, runs 
from the biceps tendon across the cubital fossa and merges with 
the antebrachial (deep) fascia covering the  exor muscles on the 
medial side of the forearm.

to the biceps and produces the greatest amount of  exion force.
• The coracobrachialis, an elongated muscle in the superomedial 
part of the arm, is pierced by the musculocutaneous nerve. 
It helps  ex and adduct the shoulder joint.
• Rupture of the tendon of the long head of the biceps usually re-
sults from wear and tear of an in amed tendon (biceps tendinitis). 
Normally, the tendon is torn from its attachment to the supragle-
noid tubercle of the scapula. The detached muscle belly forms a ball 
near the center of the distal part of the anterior aspect of the arm.

B. Surface anatomy.
Atrophy of the deltoid occurs when the axillary nerve (C5 and 
C6) is severely damaged (e.g., as might occur when the surgical 
neck of the humerus is fractured). As the deltoid atrophies, the 
rounded contour of the shoulder disappears. This gives the shoul-
der a  attened appearance and produces a slight hollow inferior to 
the acromion. A loss of sensation may occur over the lateral side 
of the proximal part of the arm, the area supplied by the superior 
lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm. To test the deltoid (or the func-
tion of the axillary nerve), the shoulder joint is abducted against 
resistance, starting from approximately 15 degrees. Supraspinatus 
initiates abduction at the shoulder joint.

• The axillary artery passes just inferior to the tip of the coracoid 
process and courses posterior to the coracobrachialis. At the 
inferior border of the teres major, the axillary artery changes 
names to become the brachial artery and continues distally on 
the anterior aspect of the brachialis.
• Although collateral pathways confer some protection against 
gradual temporary and partial occlusion, sudden complete occlu-
sion or laceration of the brachial artery creates a surgical emer-
gency because paralysis of muscles results from ischemia within a 
few hours.
• The median nerve lies adjacent to the axillary and brachial arteries 
and then crosses the artery from lateral to medial.
•  Proximally, the ulnar nerve is adjacent to the medial side of the 
artery, passes posterior to the medial intermuscular septum, and 
descends on the medial head of triceps to pass posterior to the 
medial epicondyle; here, the ulnar nerve is palpable.
•  The superior ulnar collateral artery and ulnar collateral branch of 
the radial nerve (to medial head of the triceps) accompany the 
ulnar nerve in the arm.

• The lateral head is re ected laterally, and the medial head is at-
tached to the deep surface of the triceps tendon, which attaches 
to the olecranon.
• The radial nerve and profunda brachii artery pass between the 
proximal attachments of the long and medial heads of the tri-
ceps brachii in the middle third of the arm, directly contacting 
the radial groove of the humerus.
• Midarm fracture. The middle third of the arm is a common site 
for fractures of the humerus, often with associated radial nerve 
trauma. When the radial nerve is injured in the radial groove, the 
triceps brachii muscle typically is only weakened because only the 
medial head is affected. However, the muscles in the posterior 
compartment of the forearm, supplied by more distal branches 
of the radial nerve, are paralyzed. The characteristic clinical sign 
of radial nerve injury is wrist drop (inability to extend the wrist 
joint and  ngers at the metacarpophalangeal joints).
•  The axillary nerve passes through the quadrangular space along 
with the posterior circum ex humeral artery.
•  The ulnar nerve follows the medial border of the triceps then 
passes posterior to the medial epicondyle.

• The infraspinatus muscle, aided by the teres minor and spinal 
(posterior)  bers of the deltoid muscle, rotates the shoulder joint 
laterally.
• The long head of the triceps muscle passes between the teres 
minor and teres major and separates the quadrangular space 
from the triangular interval.
• Regarding the distribution of the suprascapular and axillary 
nerves, each comes from C5 and C6; each supplies two muscles—
the suprascapular nerve innervates the supraspinatus and infra-
spinatus, and the axillary nerve innervates the teres minor and 
deltoid muscles. Both nerves supply the shoulder joint, but only 
the axillary nerve has a cutaneous branch.
•  Axillary nerve injury may occur when the glenohumeral (shoul-
der) joint dislocates because of its close relation to the inferior 
part of the joint capsule. Subglenoid displacement of the head 
of the humerus into the quadrangular space may damage the 
axillary nerve. Axillary nerve injury is indicated by paralysis of the 
deltoid and sensory loss over the lateral side of the proximal part 
of the arm.

Several arteries join to form anastomoses on the anterior and 
posterior surfaces of the scapula. The importance of the collateral 
circulation made possible by these anastomoses becomes apparent 
when ligation of a lacerated subclavian or axillary artery is nec-
essary or there is occlusion of these vessels. The direction of blood 
 ow in the subscapular artery is then reversed, enabling blood to 
reach the third part of the axillary artery. In contrast to a sudden 
occlusion, slow occlusion of an artery often enables suf cient lateral 
circulation to develop, preventing ischemia (de ciency of blood).

• The shoulder region includes the sternoclavicular, acromiocla-
vicular, and shoulder (glenohumeral) joints; the mobility of the 
clavicle is essential to the movement of the upper limb.
• The sternoclavicular joint is the only joint connecting the upper 
limb (appendicular skeleton) to the trunk (axial skeleton). 
The articular disc of the sternoclavicular joint divides the joint 
cavity into two parts and attaches superiorly to the clavicle and 
inferiorly to the  rst costal cartilage; the disc resists superior and 
medial displacement of the clavicle.
Paralysis of serratus anterior. Note that when the serratus ante-
rior is paralyzed because of injury to the long thoracic nerve (B), 
the medial border of the scapula moves laterally and posteriorly 
away from the thoracic wall, giving the scapula the appearance of 
a wing (winged scapula). See Clinical Comment for Figure 2.29.

long head of biceps muscle becomes frayed, leaving it adherent 
to the intertubercular groove. Of 95 dissecting room subjects in 
Dr. Grant’s lab, none of the 18 younger than 50 years of age had 
a perforation, but 4 of the 19 who were 50 to 60 years and 23 of

• The loose  brous capsule is attached to the margin of the

• The strong coracoclavicular ligament provides stability to the 
acromioclavicular joint and prevents the scapula from being 
driven medially and the acromion from being driven inferior to

B. Synovial membrane of joint capsule. The synovial membrane 
lines the  brous capsule and has two prolongations: (1) where it 
forms a synovial sheath for the tendon of the long head of the 
biceps muscle in its osseo brous tunnel and (2) inferior to the 
coracoid process, where it forms a bursa between the subscapularis 
tendon and margin of the glenoid cavity—the subtendinous bursa 
of the subscapularis. C. Glenohumeral ligaments viewed from the 
interior of the shoulder joint.
• The joint is exposed from the posterior aspect by cutting 
away the thinner postero-inferior part of the capsule and sawing 
off the head of the humerus.
• The glenohumeral ligaments are visible from within the joint but 
are not easily seen externally.
• The glenohumeral ligaments and tendon of the long head of 
biceps brachii muscle converge on the supraglenoid tubercle.
•  The slender superior glenohumeral ligament lies parallel to the 
tendon of the long head of biceps brachii. The middle ligament 
is free medially because the subtendinous bursa of subscapularis 
communicates with the joint cavity; usually, there is only a single 
site of communication. In this individual, there are openings on 
both sides of the ligament.
Because of its freedom of movement and instability, the glenohu-
meral joint is commonly dislocated by direct or indirect injury. Most 
dislocations of the humeral head occur in the downward (inferior) 
direction but are described clinically as anterior or (more rarely) pos-
terior dislocations, indicating whether the humeral head has de-
scended anterior or posterior to the infraglenoid tubercle and the 
long head of triceps. Anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint 
occurs most often in young adults, particularly athletes. It is usually 
caused by excessive extension and lateral rotation of the humerus.

• The subacromial bursa is between the acromion and deltoid 
superiorly and the tendon of supraspinatus inferiorly.
• The four short rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, 
teres minor, and subscapularis) cross the glenohumeral joint and 
blend with the capsule.
• The axillary nerve and posterior circum ex humeral artery are in 
contact with the capsule inferiorly and may be injured when the 
glenohumeral joint dislocates.
•  In ammation and calci cation of the subacromial bursa result 
in pain, tenderness, and limitation of movement of the gleno-
humeral joint. This condition is also known as calci c scapu-
lohumeral bursitis. Deposition of calcium in the supraspinatus 
tendon may irritate the overlying subacromial bursa, producing 
an in ammatory reaction, subacromial bursitis.

• The coraco-acromial arch (coracoid process, coraco-acromial 
ligament, and acromion) prevents superior displacement of the 
head of the humerus.
• The long head of the triceps brachii muscle arises just inferior to 
the glenoid cavity; the long head of biceps just superior to it.
• The main function of the musculotendinous rotator cuff is to 
hold the large head of the humerus in the smaller and shallow 
glenoid cavity of the scapula, both during the relaxed state (by 
tonic contraction) and during active abduction.
Tearing of the  brocartilaginous glenoid labrum commonly oc-
curs in the athletes who throw (e.g., a baseball) and in those who 
have shoulder instability and subluxation (partial dislocation) of 
the glenohumeral joint. The tear often results from sudden con-
traction of the biceps or forceful subluxation of the humeral head 
over the glenoid labrum. Usually, a tear occurs in the anterosupe-
rior part of the labrum.

• The cubital fossa is a triangular space (compartment) inferior to 
the elbow crease, roofed by deep fascia.
• In the forearm, the super cial veins (cephalic, median, basilic, 
and their connecting veins) make a variable, M-shaped pattern.
• The cephalic and basilic veins occupy the bicipital grooves, one 
on each side of the biceps brachii. In the lateral bicipital groove, 
the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm appears just superior 
to the elbow crease; in the medial bicipital groove, the medial 
cutaneous nerve of the forearm becomes cutaneous at approxi-
mately the midpoint of the arm.
•  The cubital fossa is the common site for sampling and transfu-
sion of blood and intravenous injections because of the prom-
inence and accessibility of veins. Usually, the median cubital vein 
or basilic vein is selected.

C. Boundaries and contents of the cubital fossa.
• The cubital fossa is bound laterally by the brachioradialis and 
medially by the pronator teres and superiorly by a line joining 
the medial and lateral epicondyles.
• The three chief contents of the cubital fossa are the biceps 
brachii tendon, brachial artery, and median nerve.
• The biceps brachii tendon, on approaching its insertion, rotates 
through 90 degrees, and the bicipital aponeurosis extends 
medially from the proximal part of the tendon.
•  A fracture of the distal part of the humerus, near the supra-
epicondylar ridges, is called a supra-epicondylar (supracondylar) 
fracture. The distal bone fragment may be displaced anteriorly 
or posteriorly. Any of the nerves or branches of the brachial ves-
sels related to the humerus may be injured by a displaced bone 
fragment.

• Part of the biceps brachii muscle is excised, and the cubital fossa 
is opened widely, exposing the brachialis and supinator muscles 
in the  oor of the fossa.
• The deep branch of the radial nerve pierces the supinator.
• The brachial artery lies between the biceps tendon and median 
nerve and divides into two branches, the ulnar and radial arteries.
•  The median nerve supplies the  exor muscles. With the excep-
tion of the twig to the deep head of pronator teres, its motor 
branches arise from its medial side.
• The radial nerve supplies the extensor muscles. With the excep-
tion of the twig to brachioradialis, its motor branches arise from its 
lateral side. In this specimen, the radial nerve has been displaced 
laterally, so here its lateral branches appear to run medially.

A. Supracondylar process of humerus. A  brous band, from which 
the pronator teres muscle arises, joins this supra-epicondylar pro-
cess to the medial epicondyle. The median nerve, often accompa-

this band. This may be a cause of nerve entrapment. B. Third head

variable relationship of these two structures can be explained de-
velopmentally. In a study of 307 limbs in Dr. Grant’s lab, portions 
of both primitive brachial arteries persisted in 5%, the posterior in 
82%, and the anterior in 13%.

Deep dissection. The distal portion of the triceps brachii muscle was 
removed. Note that the ulnar nerve descends subfascially within the 
posterior compartment of the arm, passing posterior to the medial 
epicondyle in the groove for the ulnar nerve. Next, it passes posterior 
to the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow joint and then between 
the  exor carpi ulnaris and  exor digitorum profundus muscles.
Ulnar nerve injury occurs most commonly where the nerve 
passes posterior to the medial epicondyle of the humerus. The injury 
results when the medial part of the elbow hits a hard surface, frac-
turing the medial epicondyle. The ulnar nerve may be compressed 
in the cubital tunnel, resulting in cubital tunnel syndrome. The 
cubital tunnel is formed by the tendinous arch joining the humeral 
and ulnar heads of attachment of the  exor carpi ulnaris muscle. 
Ulnar nerve injury can result in extensive motor and sensory loss 
to the hand.

The subcutaneous olecranon bursa is exposed to injury during 
falls on the elbow and to infection from abrasions of the skin covering 
the olecranon. Repeated excessive pressure and friction produces a 
friction subcutaneous olecranon bursitis (e.g., “student’s elbow”). 
Subtendinous olecranon bursitis results from excessive friction 
between the triceps tendon and the olecranon. For example, it 
may occur due to repeated  exion-extension of the forearm during 
certain assembly-line jobs. The pain is severe during  exion of the 
forearm because of pressure exerted on the in amed subtendinous 
olecranon bursa by the triceps tendon.

B. Anular ligament.
• The anular ligament secures the head of the radius to the radial 
notch of the ulna and with it forms a tapering columnar socket 
(i.e., wide superiorly, narrow inferiorly).
• The anular ligament is bound to the humerus by the radial 
collateral ligament of the elbow.
A common childhood injury is subluxation and dislocation of the 
head of the radius after traction on a pronated forearm (e.g., when 
lifting a child onto a bus). The sudden pulling of the upper limb 
tears or stretches the distal attachment of the less tapering anular 
ligament of a child. The radial head then moves distally, partially 
out of the anular ligament. The proximal part of the torn ligament 
may become trapped between the head of the radius and the ca-
pitulum of the humerus. The source of pain is the pinched anular 
ligament.

ARTERIES OF FOREARM
Radial artery
Origin:
In cubital fossa, as smaller terminal branch of brachial artery
Course/ Distribution:
Runs distally under brachioradialis, lateral to  exor carpi radialis, de ning boundary 
between the  exor and extensor compartments and supplying the radial aspect of both. 
Gives rise to a super cial palmar branch near the radiocarpal joint; it then transverses 
the anatomical snuff box to pass between the heads of the  rst dorsal interosseous 
muscle joining the deep branch of the ulnar artery to form the deep palmar arch
Ulnar artery
Origin: In cubital fossa, as larger terminal branch of brachial artery
Course/ Distribution: Passes distally between second and third layers of forearm

• At the elbow, the brachial artery lies between 
the biceps tendon and median nerve. It then 
bifurcates into the radial and ulnar arteries.
• At the wrist, the radial artery is lateral to the  exor 
carpi radialis tendon, and the ulnar artery is lateral 
to  exor carpi ulnaris tendon.
• In the forearm, the radial artery lies between the 
 exor and extensor compartments. The muscles 
lateral to the artery are supplied by the radial 
nerve, and those medial to it by the median and 
ulnar nerves; thus, no motor nerve crosses the 
radial artery.
• The brachioradialis muscle slightly overlaps the 
radial artery, which is otherwise super cial.
• The four super cial muscles all attach proxi-
mally to the medial epicondyle of the humerus 
(common  exor origin).
• The palmaris longus muscle, in this specimen, has 
an anomalous distal belly; this muscle usually has 
a small belly at the common  exor origin and a 
long tendon that is continued into the palm as 
the palmar aponeurosis. The palmaris longus is 
absent unilaterally or bilaterally in approximately 
14% of limbs.

• The ulnar artery passes obliquely posterior to the  exor digitorum 
super cialis; at the medial border of the muscle, the ulnar artery 
joins the ulnar nerve.
•  The median nerve descends vertically posterior to the  exor 
digitorum super cialis and appears distally at its lateral border.
•  The median artery of this specimen is a variation resulting from 
persistence of an embryologic vessel that usually disappears.

• The ulnar nerve enters the forearm posterior 
to the medial epicondyle, then descends 
between the  exor digitorum profundus and 
 exor carpi ulnaris, and is joined by the ulnar 
artery. At the wrist, the ulnar nerve and artery 
pass anterior to the  exor retinaculum and 
lateral to the pisiform to enter the palm.
• At the elbow, the ulnar nerve supplies the 
 exor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of 
the  exor digitorum profundus muscles; 
proximal to the wrist, it gives off the dorsal 
(cutaneous) branch.
• The four lumbricals arise from the  exor 
digitorum profundus tendons.

• The anterior interosseous nerve and artery pass deeply between 
the  exor pollicis longus and  exor digitorum profundus mus-
cles to lie on the interosseous membrane.
• The deep branch of the radial nerve pierces and innervates the 
supinator muscle.
Severance of the deep branch of the radial nerve results in an 
inability to extend the thumb and MCP joints of the other digits. 
Loss of sensation does not occur because the deep branch is 
entirely muscular and articular in distribution.

deep to the lateral margin of the tendon is the median nerve.
• Note the ulnar (Guyon) canal through which the ulnar vessels 
and nerve pass medial to the pisiform.
•  The radial artery passes deep to the tendon of the abductor 
pollicis longus muscle.
•  The  exor digitorum super cialis tendons to the 3rd and 4th 
digits become anterior to those of the 2nd and 5th digits.
•  The recurrent branch of the median nerve to the thenar muscles 
lies within a circle whose center is 2.5 to 4 cm distal to the 
tubercle of the scaphoid.

Lesions of the median nerve usually occur in two places: the fore-
arm and wrist. The most common site is where the nerve passes 
though the carpal tunnel. Lacerations of the wrist often cause me-
dian nerve injury because this nerve is relatively close to the sur-
face. This results in paralysis of the thenar muscles and the  rst two 
lumbricals. Hence, opposition of the thumb is not possible and  ne 
control movements of the 2nd and 3rd digits are impaired. Sensa-
tion is also lost over the thumb and adjacent two and a half digits.
Median nerve injury resulting from a perforating wound in the 
elbow region results in loss of  exion of the proximal and distal 
interphalangeal joints of the 2nd and 3rd digits. The ability to 
 ex the metacarpophalangeal joints of these digits is also affected 
because digital branches of the median nerve supply the 1st and 
2nd lumbricals. The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve 
does not traverse the carpal tunnel. It supplies the skin of the cen-
tral palm, which remains sensitive in carpal tunnel syndrome.

The palmar skin presents several more or less constant  exion 
creases where the skin is  rmly bound to the deep fascia:
• Wrist creases: proximal, middle, distal. The distal wrist crease 
indicates the proximal border of the  exor retinaculum.
• Palmar creases: radial longitudinal crease (the “life line” of 
palmistry), proximal and distal transverse palmar creases
•  Transverse digital flexion creases: The proxim al digital crease 
is located at the root of the digit, approximately 2 cm dis-
tal to the metacarpophalangeal joint. The proximal digital 
crease of the thumb crosses obliquely, proximal to the 1st 
metacarpophalangeal joint. The m iddle digital crease lies 
over the proximal interphalangeal joint, and the distal digi-
tal crease lies proximal to the distal interphalangeal joint. 
The thumb, having two phalanges, has only two flexion 
creases.

SURFACE ANATOMY OF HAND AND WRIST

 
ANTERIOR WRIST AND PALM OF HAND  Upper Limb 
151
A. Anterior view. The palmar fascia is thin over the thenar and 
hypothenar eminences but thick centrally, where it forms the 
palmar aponeurosis, and in the digits, where it forms the  brous 
digital sheaths. At the distal end (base) of the palmar aponeurosis, 
four bundles of digital and spiral bands continue to the bases and 
 brous digital sheaths of digits 2 to 5.
B. Dupuytren contracture is a disease of the palmar fas-
cia resulting in progressive shortening, thickening, and fibrosis 
of the palmar fascia and palmar aponeurosis. The fibrous de-
generation of the longitudinal digital bands of the aponeurosis 
on the medial side of the hand pulls the 4th and 5th fingers 
into partial flexion at the metacarpophalangeal and proximal 
interphalangeal joints. The contracture is frequently bilateral. 
Treatment of Dupuytren contracture usually involves surgical 
excision of all fibrotic parts of the palmar fascia to free the 
fingers.

• The potential midpalmar space lies posterior to the central com-
partment, is bounded medially by the hypothenar compart-
ment, and is related distally to the synovial sheath of the 3rd, 
4th, and 5th digits.
• The potential thenar space lies posterior to the thenar compartment 
and is related distally to the synovial sheath of the index  nger.
• The potential midpalmar and thenar spaces are separated by 
a septum that passes from the palmar aponeurosis to the 3rd 
metacarpal.
Because the palmar fascia is thick and strong, swellings result-
ing from hand infections usually appear on the dorsum of the 
hand where the fascia is thinner. The potential fascial spaces of 
the palm are important because they may become infected. The 
fascial spaces determine the extent and direction of the spread of 
pus formed in the infected areas. Depending on the site of infec-
tion, pus will accumulate in the thenar, hypothenar, or adductor 
compartments. Antibiotic therapy has made infections that spread 
beyond one of these fascial compartments rare, but an untreated 
infection can spread proximally through the carpal tunnel into the 
forearm anterior to the pronator quadratus and its fascia.

• From the palmar aponeurosis, four longitudinal digital bands 
enter the  ngers; the other  bers form extensive  bro-areolar 
septa that pass posteriorly to the palmar ligaments (see Fig. 2.78) 
and, more proximally, to the fascia covering the interossei. Thus, 
two sets of tunnels exist in the distal half of the palm: (1) tunnels 
for long  exor tendons and (2) tunnels for lumbricals, digital 
vessels, and digital nerves.
•  In the dissected middle  nger, note the absence of fat deep to 
the skin creases of the  ngers.

• The skin, super cial fascia, palmar aponeurosis, and thenar and 
hypothenar fasciae have been removed.
• The super cial palmar arch is formed by the ulnar artery and 
completed by the super cial palmar branch of the radial artery.
• The four lumbricals lie posterior to the digital vessels and nerves. 
The lumbricals arise from the lateral sides of the  exor digitorum 
profundus tendons and are inserted into the lateral sides of the 
dorsal expansions of the corresponding digits. The medial two 
lumbricals are bipennate and also arise from the medial sides of 
adjacent  exor digitorum profundus tendons.
•  In the digits, a proper palmar digital artery and nerve lie on each 
side of the  brous digital sheath.
•  Note the canal (Guyon) through which the ulnar vessels and 
nerve pass medial to the pisiform.
Laceration of palmar (arterial) arches. Bleeding is usually profuse 
when the palmar (arterial) arches are lacerated. It may not be suf -
cient to ligate (tie off) only one forearm artery when the arches are 
lacerated because these vessels usually have numerous communi-
cations in the forearm and hand and thus bleed from both ends.

Carpal tunnel syndrome results from any lesion that signi -
cantly reduces the size of the carpal tunnel or, more commonly, 
increases the size of some of the structures (or their coverings) that 
pass through it (e.g., in ammation of the synovial sheaths). The 
median nerve is the most vulnerable structure in the carpal tunnel. 
The median nerve has two terminal sensory branches that supply 
the skin of the hand; hence, paresthesia (tingling), hypoesthesia 
(diminished sensation), or anesthesia (absence of tactile sensation) 
may occur in the lateral three and a half digits. However, recall that 
the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve arises proximal 
to and does not pass through the carpal tunnel; thus, sensation 
in the central palm remains unaffected. This nerve also has one 
terminal motor branch, the recurrent branch, which innervates the 
three thenar muscles. Wasting of the thenar eminence and pro-
gressive loss of coordination and strength in the thumb may occur. 
To relieve the compression, partial or complete surgical division of 
the  exor retinaculum, a procedure called carpal tunnel release, 
may be necessary. The incision is made toward the medial side 
of the wrist and  exor retinaculum to avoid possible injury to the 
recurrent branch of the median nerve. This procedure is also done 
laparoscopically.

Injuries such as puncture of a  nger by a rusty nail can cause 
infection of the digital synovial sheaths. When in ammation of 
the tendon and synovial sheath (tenosynovitis) occurs, the digit 
swells and movement becomes painful. Because the tendons of the 
2nd to 4th digits nearly always have separate synovial sheaths, the 
infection usually is con ned to the infected digits. If the infection is 
untreated, the proximal ends of these sheaths may rupture, allowing 
the infection to spread to the midpalmar space. Because the synovial 
sheath of the little  nger is usually continuous with the common 
 exor sheath, tenosynovitis in this  nger may spread to the com-
mon  exor sheath and through the palm and carpal tunnel to the 
anterior forearm. Likewise, tenosynovitis in the thumb may spread 
through the continuous tendinous sheath of  exor pollicis longus.

A. Fibrous digital and synovial sheaths. B. Anular and cruciate 
parts (pulleys) of the  brous digital sheath.
Fibrous digital sheaths are the strong ligamentous tunnels 
containing the  exor tendons and their synovial sheaths. The 
sheaths extend from the heads of the metacarpals to the bases 
of the distal phalanges. These sheaths prevent the tendons from 
pulling away from the digits (bowstringing). The  brous digital 
sheaths combine with the bones to form osseo brous tunnels 
through which the tendons pass to reach the digits. The anular 
and cruciform (cruciate) parts, often referred to clinically as 
“pulleys,” are thickened reinforcements of the  brous digital 
sheaths.

• The deep branch of the ulnar artery joins the radial artery to 
form the deep palmar arch.
• The pisohamate ligament is often considered a continuation of 
the tendon of  exor carpi ulnaris, making the pisiform a sesa-
moid bone.
Com pression of the ulnar nerve may occur at the wrist where 
it passes between the pisiform and the hook of hamate. The 
depression between these bones is converted by the pisoha-
mate ligament into an osseofibrous ulnar canal. Ulnar canal 
synd rom e is manifested by hypoesthesia in the medial one 
and one half digits and weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles. 
Clawing of the 4th and 5th digits may occur, but in contrast 
to proximal nerve injury, their ability to flex the wrist joint is 
unaffected.

• Three unipennate palmar (P1–P3) and four bipennate dorsal 
(D1–D4) interosseous muscles are illustrated; the palmar inter-
ossei adduct the  ngers, and the dorsal interossei abduct the 
 ngers in relation to the axial line, an imaginary line through the 
long axis of the 3rd digit (see Table 2.13).
• The deep transverse metacarpal ligaments unite the palmar liga-
ments; the lumbricals pass anterior to the deep transverse meta-
carpal ligament, and the interossei pass posterior to the ligament.
•  The pisohamate and pisometacarpal ligaments form the distal

Note that the super cial palmar arch is usually com-
pleted by the super cial palmar branch of the radial 
artery, but in this specimen, the dorsalis pollicis artery 
completes the arch.
The super cial and deep palmar (arterial) arches 
are not palpable, but their surface markings are vis-
ible. The super cial palmar arch occurs at the level of 
the distal border of the fully extended thumb. The deep 
palmar arch lies approximately 1 cm proximal to the 
super cial palmar arch. The location of these arches 
should be borne in mind in wounds of the palm and 
when palmar incisions are made.
Intermittent bilateral attacks of ischemia of the 
digits, marked by cyanosis and often accompanied by 
paresthesia and pain, are characteristically brought on 
by cold and emotional stimuli. The condition may re-
sult from an anatomical abnormality or an underlying 
disease. When the cause of the condition is idiopathic 
(unknown) or primary, it is called Raynaud syndrome 
(disease). Since arteries receive innervation from post-
synaptic  bers from the sympathetic ganglia, it may be 
necessary to perform a cervicodorsal presynaptic sym-
pathectomy to dilate the digital arteries.

• Six tendinous sheaths occupy the six osseo brous tunnels deep 
to the extensor retinaculum. They contain nine tendons: tendons 
for the thumb in sheaths 1 and 3, tendons for the extensors of 
the wrist in sheaths 2 and 6, and tendons for the extensors of 
the wrist and  ngers in sheaths 4 and 5.
•  The tendon of the extensor pollicis longus hooks around the 
dorsal tubercle of radius to pass obliquely across the tendons of 
the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis to the thumb.
The tendons of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis 
brevis are in the same tendinous sheath on the dorsum of the wrist. 
Excessive friction of these tendons results in  brous thickening 
of the sheath and stenosis of the osseo brous tunnel, Quervain 
tenovaginitis stenosans. This condition causes pain in the wrist 
that radiates proximally to the forearm and distally to the thumb.

E. Tendons on dorsum of hand and extensor retinaculum.
• The deep fascia is thickened to form the extensor retinaculum.
• Proximal to the knuckles, intertendinous connections extend be-
tween the tendons of the digital extensors and, thereby, restrict 
the independent action of the  ngers.
Ganglion cyst. Sometimes a nontender cystic swelling appears on the 
hand, most commonly on the dorsum of the wrist. The thin-walled 
cyst contains clear mucinous  uid. Clinically, this type of swelling is 
called a ganglion (a swelling or knot). These synovial cysts are close 
to and often communicate with the synovial sheaths. The distal at-
tachment of the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon is a common 
site for such a cyst.

• The hood covering the head of the metacarpal is attached to the 
palmar ligament.
• Contraction of the muscles attaching to the lateral band will 
produce  exion of the metacarpophalangeal joint and extension 
of the interphalangeal joints.
•  The retinacular ligament is a  brous band that runs from the 
proximal phalanx and  brous digital sheath obliquely across the 
middle phalanx and two interphalangeal joints to join the exten-
sor (dorsal) expansion and then to the distal phalanx.
•  On  exion of the distal interphalangeal joint, the retinacular 
ligament becomes taut and pulls the proximal joint into  exion; 
on extension of the proximal joint, the distal joint is pulled by 
the ligament into nearly complete extension.

D. Surface anatomy.
Fracture of the scaphoid often results from a fall on the palm 
with the hand abducted. The fracture occurs across the narrow part 
(“waist”) of the scaphoid. Pain occurs primarily on the lateral side of the 
wrist, especially during dorsi exion and abduction of the hand. Initial 
radiographs of the wrist may not reveal a fracture, but radiographs 
taken 10 to 14 days later reveal a fracture because bone resorption 
has occurred. Owing to the poor blood supply to the proximal part of 
the scaphoid, union of the fractured parts may take several months. 
Avascular necrosis of the proximal fragment of the scaphoid 
(pathological death of bone resulting from poor blood supply) may 
occur and produce degenerative joint disease of the wrist.

The eight carpal bones form two rows: in the distal row, 
the hamate, capitate, trapezoid, and trapezium, the trapezium 
forming a saddle-shaped joint with the 1st metacarpal; and in 
the proximal row, the scaphoid, lunate, and pisiform, the pisi-
form being superimposed on the triquetrum.
Severe crushing injuries of the hand may produce multiple 
metacarpal fractures, resulting in instability of the hand. Similar 
injuries of the distal phalanges are common (e.g., when a  nger 
is caught in a car door). A fracture of a distal phalanx is usually 
comminuted, and a painful hematoma (collection of blood) 
develops. Fractures of the proximal and middle phalanges 
are usually the result of crushing or hypertension injuries.

and 5th are hinge-shaped synovial joints with limited movement.
Anterior d islocation of the lunate is a serious injury that 
usually results from a fall on the extended wrist. The lunate is 
pushed to the palmar surface of the wrist and may compress 
the median nerve and lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Be-
cause of poor blood supply, avascular necrosis of the lunate 
may occur.

• A  brocartilaginous plate, the palmar ligament, hangs from the 
base of the proximal phalanx; is  xed to the head of the meta-
carpal by the weaker, fanlike part of the collateral ligament (A); 
and moves like a visor across the metacarpal head (C). The IP 
joints have similar palmar ligaments.
•  The extremely strong, cordlike parts of the collateral liga-
ments of this joint (A and B) are eccentrically attached to 
the metacarpal heads; they are slack during extension and 
taut during  exion (C), so the  ngers cannot be spread 
( abducted) unless the hand is open; the IP joints have similar 
collateral ligaments.
Skier’s thumb refers to the rupture or chronic laxity of the col-
lateral ligament of the 1st metacarpophalangeal joint. The injury 
results from hyperextension of the joint, which occurs when the 
thumb is held by the ski pole while the rest of the hand hits the 
ground or enters the snow.

A. Cylindrical (power) grasp. When grasping an object, the meta-
carpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints are  exed, but the ra-
diocarpal joints are extended. Without wrist extension, the grip is 
weak and insecure. B. Hook grasp. This grasp involves primarily 
the long  exors of the  ngers, which are  exed to a varying degree 
depending on the size of the object. C. Tripod (three-jaw chuck) 
pinch. D. and E. Fingertip pinch. F. Rest position of hand. Casts 
for fractures are applied most often with the hand in this posi-
tion. G. Loose cylindrical grasp. H. Firm cylindrical (power) grasp.

• The subject is adducting the shoulders against resistance to 
demonstrate the pectoralis major muscle.
• The sternum (breastbone) lies subcutaneously in the anterior 
median line and is palpable throughout its length.
• The suprasternal notch can be palpated between the prominent 
medial ends of the clavicles.
•  The pectoralis major muscle has two parts, the sternocostal and 
clavicular heads.
•  The inferior border of the sternocostal head of the pectoralis 
major muscle forms the anterior axillary fold. The axillary fossa 
(“armpit”) is a surface feature overlying a fat- lled space, the 
axilla, posterior to the anterior fold.
•  The male nipple overlies the 4th intercostal space.

• The platysma muscle, which descends to the 2nd or 3rd rib, is 
cut short on both sides of the specimen; together with the su-
praclavicular nerves, it is re ected superiorly on the right side.
• The pectoral fascia covers the pectoralis major.
• The clavicle lies deep to the subcutaneous tissue and the 
platysma muscle.
• The cephalic vein passes deeply in the clavipectoral (deltopec-
toral) triangle to join the axillary vein.
•  Supraclavicular (C3 and C4) and upper thoracic nerves (T2 to 
T6) supply cutaneous innervation to the pectoral region.
•  The clavipectoral (deltopectoral) triangle, bounded by the 
clavicle superiorly, the deltoid muscle laterally, and the clavicular 
head of the pectoralis major muscle medially, underlies a surface 
depression called the infraclavicular fossa.

A. Overview. B. Breast. The roughly circular base of the female 
breast extends transversely from the lateral border of the sternum 
to the midaxillary line and vertically from the 2nd to 6th ribs. 
A small part of the breast may extend along the inferolateral edge 
of the pectoralis major muscle toward the axillary fossa, forming an 
axillary process or tail (of Spence). C. Areola and nipple.
Polymastia (supernumerary breasts) or polythelia (accessory 
nipples) may occur superior or inferior to the normal pair, occa-
sionally developing in the axillary fossa or anterior abdominal wall. 
Supernumerary breasts usually consist of only a rudimentary nipple 
and areola, which may be mistaken for a mole (nevus) until they 
change pigmentation with the normal nipples during pregnancy.

A. Dissection.
• On the specimen’s right side, the skin is removed; on the left 
side, the breast is sagittally sectioned.
• Two thirds of the breast rests on the pectoral fascia covering 
the pectoralis major; the other third rests on the fascia cover-
ing the serratus anterior muscle.
• The region of loose connective tissue between the pectoral 
fascia and the deep surface of the breast, the retromammary 
space (bursa), permits the breast to move on the deep fascia.
Cancer can spread by contiguity (invasion of adjacent tis-
sue). When breast cancer cells invade the retromammary space, 
attach to or invade the pectoral fascia overlying the pectoralis 
major, or metastasize to the interpectoral nodes (Fig. 3.7), the 
breast elevates when the muscle contracts. This movement is a 
clinical sign of advanced cancer of the breast.
B. Breast quadrants. For the anatomical location and descrip-
tion of tumors and cysts, the surface of the breast is divided 
into four quadrants. For example, “A hard irregular mass was 
felt in the superior medial quadrant of the breast at the 2 o’clock 
position, approximately 2.5 cm from the margin of the areola.”

ules. Each lobe has a lactiferous duct that widens to form the lac-
tiferous sinus before opening on the nipple. C. Galactogram. This 
is used to image the duct system of the breast. Contrast material is 
injected into the ducts and mammograms are then taken.
Interference with the lymphatic drainage by cancer may cause 
lymphedema (edema, excess  uid in the subcutaneous tissue), which 
in turn may result in deviation of the nipple and a leathery, thick-
ened appearance of the breast skin. Prominent (puffy) skin between 
dimpled pores may develop, which gives the skin an orange-peel ap-
pearance (peau d’orange sign). Larger dimples may form if pulled by 
cancerous invasion of the suspensory ligaments of the breast.

A. Overview. Lymph drained from the upper limb and breast passes 
through nodes arranged irregularly in groups of axillary lymph 
nodes: (1) pectoral, along the inferior border of the pectoralis minor 
muscle; (2) subscapular, along the subscapular artery and veins; 
(3) humeral, along the distal part of the axillary vein; (4) central, 
at the base of the axilla, embedded in axillary fat; and (5) apical, 
along the axillary vein between the clavicle and the pectoralis minor 
muscle. Most of the breast drains via the pectoral, central, and api-
cal axillary nodes to the subclavian lymph trunk, which joins the 
venous system at the junction of the subclavian and internal jugular 
veins. The medial part of the breast drains to the parasternal nodes, 
which are located along the internal thoracic vessels.

B. Pattern of lymphatic drainage. Breast cancer typically spreads 
by means of lymphatic vessels (lymphogenic metastasis), which 
carry cancer cells from the breast to the lymph nodes, chie y those 
in the axilla. The cells lodge in the nodes, producing nests of tumor 
cells (metastases). Abundant communications among lymphatic 
pathways and among axillary, cervical, and parasternal nodes may 
also cause metastases from the breast to develop in the supracla-
vicular lymph nodes, the opposite breast, or the abdomen. The 
prognosis of breast cancer has been correlated with the level of 
metastasis (Level I, II, or III in C) and to the number of involved 
axillary lymph nodes. C. Flow of lymph from the breast and upper

Arteries enter and veins drain the breast from its superomedial and 
superolateral aspects; vessels also penetrate the deep surface of the 
breast. The vessels branch profusely and anastomose with each other.
Breast incisions are placed in the inferior breast quadrants 
when possible because these quadrants are less vascular than the 
superior ones.

A. Muscles comprising bed and cutaneous 
nerves. B. Dermatomes.
Local anesthesia of an intercostal space 
(intercostal nerve block) is produced by in-
jecting a local anesthetic agent around the 
intercostal nerves between the paravertebral 
line and the area of required anesthesia. Be-
cause any particular area of skin usually re-
ceives innervation from two adjacent nerves, 
considerable overlapping of contiguous der-
matomes occurs. Therefore, complete loss of 
sensation usually does not occur unless two 
or more intercostal nerves are anesthetized.

• The thoracic cage consists of 12 thoracic vertebrae, 12 pairs of 
ribs and costal cartilages, and the sternum.
• Anteriorly, the superior seven costal cartilages articulate with 
the sternum; the 8th, 9th, and 10th cartilages articulate with 
the cartilage above forming the costal margin; the 11th and 
12th are “ oating” ribs, that is, their cartilages do not articulate 
anteriorly.
• The clavicle lies over the 1st rib, making it dif cult to palpate. The 
2nd rib is easily palpable because its costal cartilage articulates 
with the sternum at the sternal angle, located at the junction of 
the manubrium and body of the sternum.
•  The 3rd to 10th ribs can be palpated in sequence inferolaterally 
from the 2nd rib; the fused costal cartilages of the 7th to 10th 
ribs form the costal arch (margin), and the tips of the 11th and 
12th ribs can be palpated posterolaterally.
•  A rib dislocation is the displacement of a costal cartilage 
from the sternum; a rib separation refers to dislocation of the 
costochondral joint.

• The superior thoracic aperture (thoracic inlet) is the doorway 
between the thoracic cavity and the neck region; it is bounded 
by the 1st thoracic vertebra, the 1st ribs and their cartilages, and 
the manubrium of the sternum.
• Each rib articulates posteriorly with the vertebral column.
• Posteriorly, all ribs angle inferiorly; anteriorly, the 3rd to 10th 
costal cartilages angle superiorly.
• The scapula is suspended from the clavicle and extends across 
the 2nd to 7th ribs posteriorly.
•  When clinicians refer to the superior thoracic aperture as the 
thoracic “outlet,” they are emphasizing the important nerves 
and arteries that pass through this aperture into the lower neck 
and upper limb. Hence, various types of thoracic outlet syn-
dromes exist, such as the costoclavicular syndrome—pallor and 
coldness of the skin of the upper limb and diminished radial 
pulse—resulting from compression of the subclavian artery be-
tween the clavicle and the 1st rib.

A. Cervical ribs. People usually have 12 ribs on each side, but the number 
may be increased by the presence of cervical and/or lumbar ribs (super-
numerary ribs) or decreased by a failure of the 12th pair to form. Cervical 
ribs (present in up to 1% of people) articulate with the C7 vertebra and are 
clinically signi cant because they may compress spinal nerves C8 and T1 or 
the inferior trunk of the brachial plexus supplying the upper limb. Tingling 
and numbness may occur along the medial border of the forearm. They 
may also compress the subclavian artery, resulting in ischemic muscle pain 
(caused by poor blood supply) in the upper limb. Lumbar ribs are less com-
mon than cervical ribs but have clinical signi cance in that they may confuse 
the identity of vertebral levels in diagnostic images. B. Bi d rib. The superior 
component of this 3rd rib is supernumerary and articulated with the lateral 
aspect of the 1st sternebra. The inferior component articulated at the junc-
tion of the 1st and 2nd sternebrae. C. Bicipital rib. In this specimen, there 
has been partial fusion of the  rst two thoracic ribs. D. Sternal foramen.

• There are two articular facets on the head of the rib: a larger, 
inferior costal facet for articulation with the vertebral body of its 
own number, and a smaller, superior costal facet for articulation 
with the vertebral body of the vertebra superior to the rib.
• The crest of the head of the rib separates the superior and infe-
rior costal facets.
•  The smooth articular part of the tubercle of the rib, the trans-
verse costal facet, articulates with the transverse process of the 
same numbered vertebra at the costotransverse joint.
C. Movements at the costotransverse joints. At the 1st to 7th 
costotransverse joints, the ribs rotate, increasing the anteroposte-
rior diameter of the thorax; at the 8th, 9th, and 10th, they glide, 
increasing the transverse diameter of the upper abdomen.

• The iliocostalis and longissimus muscles have been removed, exposing the 
levatores costarum muscle. Of the  ve intercostal spaces shown, the superior 
two (6th and 7th) are intact. In the 8th and 10th spaces, varying portions 
of the external intercostal muscle have been removed to reveal the under-
lying internal intercostal membrane, which is continuous with the internal 
intercostal muscle. In the 9th space, the levatores costarum muscle has been 
removed to show the posterior intercostal vessels and intercostal nerve.
• The intercostal vessels and nerve disappear laterally between the internal 
and innermost intercostal muscles.
• The intercostal nerve is the most inferior of the neurovascular trio (posterior 
intercostal vein and artery and intercostal nerve) and the least sheltered in 
the intercostal groove; a collateral branch arises near the angle of the rib.
• Thoracocentesis. Sometimes it is necessary to insert a hypodermic needle 
through an intercostal space into the pleural cavity (see Fig. 3.27) to obtain 
a sample of pleural  uid or to remove blood or pus. To avoid damage to the 
intercostal nerve and vessels, the needle is inserted superior to the rib, high 
enough to avoid the collateral branches.

• The internal intercostal and internal oblique muscles are in 
continuity at the ends of the 9th, 10th, and 11th intercostal 
spaces.
• The intercostal nerves lie deep to the internal intercostal mus-
cle but super cial to the innermost intercostal muscle; anteri-
orly, these nerves lie super cial to the transversus thoracis or 
transversus abdominis muscles.
• Intercostal nerves run parallel to the ribs and costal cartilages; 
on reaching the abdominal wall, nerves T7 and T8 continue 
superiorly, T9 continues nearly horizontally, and T10 contin-
ues inferomedially toward the umbilicus. These nerves pro-
vide cutaneous innervation in overlapping segmental bands.

•  Posterior intercostal arteries are branches of the aorta (the supe-
rior two spaces are supplied from the superior intercostal branch 
of the costocervical trunk); the anterior intercostal arteries are 
branches of the internal thoracic artery or its branch, the mus-
culophrenic artery.
•  The posterior rami innervate the deep back muscles and skin 
adjacent to the vertebral column.

aThe tonus of the intercostal muscles keep intercostal spaces rigid, thereby preventing them from billowing (bulging) out during expiration and from being drawn in during inspiration. The role of individual 
intercostal muscles and accessory muscles of respiration in moving the ribs is dif cult to interpret despite many electromyographic studies.
bAction traditionally assigned on the basis of attachments; these muscles appear to be largely proprioceptive in function.

•  H-shaped cuts were made through the perichondrium of 
the 3rd and 4th costal cartilages to shell out segments of 
cartilage.
• During surgery, retaining perichondrium promotes regrowth 
of removed cartilages.
• The internal thoracic (internal mammary) vessels run inferiorly 
deep to the costal cartilages and just lateral to the edge of the 
sternum, providing anterior intercostal branches.
•  The parasternal lymph nodes (green) receive lymphatic vessels 
from the anterior parts of intercostal spaces, the costal pleura 
and diaphragm, and the medial part of the breast.
•  The subclavian vessels are “sandwiched” between the 1st rib 
and clavicle and are “padded” by the subclavius.
• Surgical access to thorax. To gain access to the thoracic cavity for 
surgical procedures, the sternum is divided in the median plane 
(median sternotomy) and retracted (spread apart). After surgery, 
the halves of the sternum are held together with wire sutures.

• Unless a patient is bedridden, a chest radiograph is done 
with the x-ray beam traversing the patient from poste-
rior to anterior (PA) because this minimizes distortion. 
The scapula is protracted and not in the main  eld of view.
• Right atrium is the primary discernible structure along 
the right border of the heart.
• Within the dark gray (radiolucent) regions of both sides 
that show air in the lung, most of the linear denser 
(whiter) elements are pulmonary veins.
• Along the upper left mediastinal border, the arch of 
aorta visible, and the aorta can be followed inferiorly.
• Left auricle is often visible along the left border of the 
heart; inferiorly is the border of the left ventricle.
• In a standing PA radiograph, air is often seen in the fun-
dus of the stomach.
B. Lateral radiograph.
• Note that the left and right are not precisely superim-
posed on one another.
• Notice how well the heart is shown relative to the aerated 
lungs, which are radio-opaque because they do not block 
many photons. A loss of this clear differentiation is known 
as the silhouette sign and suggests lung disease.
• Any structure in the mediastinum may contribute to path-
ological widening of the mediastinal silhouette (e.g., 
after trauma that produces hemorrhage into the medias-
tinum), malignant lymphoma (cancer of lymphatic tissue) 
that produces massive enlargement of mediastinal lymph 
nodes, or enlargement (hypertrophy) of the heart occur-
ring with congestive heart failure.

grammatic section through heart and lungs with

• The lungs invaginate a continuous membra-
nous pleural sac; the visceral (pulmonary) 
pleura covers the lungs, and the parietal 
pleura lines the thoracic cavity; the visceral 
and parietal pleurae are continuous around 
the root of the lung.
• The parietal pleura can be divided regionally 
into the costal, diaphragmatic, mediastinal, 
and cervical parts; note the costodiaphrag-
matic recess.
• The pleural cavity is a potential space between 
the visceral and parietal pleurae that contains 
a thin layer of  uid. If a suf cient amount of air 
enters the pleural cavity, the surface tension 
adhering visceral to parietal pleura (lung to 
thoracic wall) is broken, and the lung collapses 
(atelectasis) because of its inherent elasticity 
(elastic recoil). When a lung collapses, the 
pleural cavity—normally a potential space—
becomes a real space (B) and may contain air 
(pneumothorax), blood (hemothorax), etc.

Cardiac tamponade (heart compression) is a potentially lethal 
condition because heart volume is increasingly compromised 
by the  uid outside the heart but inside the pericardial cavity. 
The heart is increasingly compressed and circulation fails. Blood 
in the pericardial cavity, hemopericardium, produces cardiac 
tamponade.

• The oblique and horizontal  ssures divide the right lung into three 
lobes: superior, middle, and inferior.
• The right lung is larger and heavier than the left but is shorter and 
wider because the right dome of the diaphragm is higher and the 
heart bulges more to the left.
• Cadaveric lungs may be shrunken,  rm, and discolored, whereas 
healthy lungs in living people are normally soft, light, and spongy.
• Each lung has an apex and base, three surfaces (costal, mediasti-
nal, and diaphragmatic), and three borders (anterior, inferior, and 
posterior).

•  The anterior border has a deep cardiac notch that indents the 
antero-inferior aspect of the superior lobe.
•  The lingula, a tonguelike process of the superior lobe, extends 
below the cardiac notch and slides in and out of the costome-
diastinal recess during inspiration and expiration.
•  The lungs of an embalmed cadaver usually retain impressions 
of structures that lie adjacent to them, such as the ribs and 
heart.

A. There are 10 right tertiary or segmental bronchi and 8 left. Note 
that in the left lung, the apical and posterior bronchi arise from a 
single stem, as do the anterior basal and medial basal. B–F. A bron-
chopulmonary segment consists of a tertiary bronchus, pulmo-
nary vein and artery, and the portion of lung they serve. These 
structures are surgically separable to allow segmental resection of 
the lung. To prepare these specimens, the tertiary bronchi of fresh 
lungs were isolated within the hilum and injected with latex of 
various colors. Minor variations in the branching of the bronchi 
result in variations in the surface patterns.

Knowledge of the anatomy of the bronchopulmonary segments is 
essential for precise interpretations of diagnostic images of the lungs 
and for surgical resection (removal) of diseased segments. During 
the treatment of lung cancer, the surgeon may remove a whole 
lung (pneumonectomy), a lobe (lobectomy), or one or more 
bronchopulmonary segments (segmentectomy). Knowledge and 
understanding of the bronchopulmonary segments and their relation-
ship to the bronchial tree are also essential for planning drainage and 
clearance techniques used in physical therapy for enhancing drainage 
from speci c areas (e.g., in patients with pneumonia or cystic  brosis).

• The segmental (tertiary) bronchi are color-coded.
• The trachea bifurcates into right and left main (primary) 
bronchi; the right main bronchus is shorter, wider, and more 
vertical than the left.
• Therefore, it is more likely that aspirated foreign bodies will 
enter and lodge in the right main bronchus or one of its de-
scending branches.
• The right main bronchus gives off the right superior lobe 
bronchus (eparterial bronchus) before entering the hilum 
(hilus) of the lung; after entering the hilum, the continuing 
intermediate bronchus divides into the right middle and infe-
rior lobar bronchi.
• The left main bronchus divides at the hilum into the left supe-
rior and left inferior lobar bronchi; the lobar bronchi further 
divide into segmental (tertiary) bronchi.

When examining the bronchi with a bronchoscope—an en-
doscope for inspecting the interior of the tracheobronchial tree 
for diagnostic purposes—one can observe a ridge, the carina, 
between the ori ces of the main bronchi. If the tracheobron-
chial lymph nodes in the angle between the main bronchi are 
enlarged (e.g., because cancer cells have metastasized from 
a bronchogenic carcinoma) the carina is distorted, widened 
posteriorly, and immobile.

• The pulmonary plexuses, located anterior and posterior to the

right and left sympathetic trunks (2nd to 5th thoracic ganglia, 
not shown) and parasympathetic contributions from the right 
and left vagus nerves; cell bodies of postsynaptic parasympa-
thetic neurons are in the pulmonary plexuses and along the 
branches of the pulmonary tree.
• The right and left vagus nerves continue inferiorly from the pos-
terior pulmonary plexus to contribute  bers to the esophageal 
plexus.
•  The phrenic nerves pass anterior to the root of the lung on their 
way to the diaphragm.
•  Visceral pleura is insensitive to pain. The autonomic nerves reach 
the visceral pleura in company with the bronchial vessels. The 
visceral pleura receives no nerves of general sensation.
•  Parietal pleura is richly supplied by branches of the somatic inter-
costal and phrenic nerves. Irritation of the parietal pleura pleuritus 
produces local pain pleurisy and referred pain to the areas sharing 
innervation by the same segments of the spinal cord.

• Lymphatic vessels originate in the subpleural (super cial) and 
deep lymphatic plexuses.
• The subpleural lymphatic plexus is super cial, lying deep to the 
visceral pleura, and drains lymph from the surface of the lung to 
the bronchopulmonary (hilar) nodes.
• The deep lymphatic plexus is in the lung and follows the bronchi 
and pulmonary vessels to the pulmonary, and then bronchopul-
monary, nodes located at the root of the lung.
• All lymph from the lungs enters the inferior (carinal) and supe-
rior tracheobronchial nodes and then continues to the right and 
left bronchomediastinal trunks to drain into the venous system 
via the right lymphatic and thoracic ducts; lymph from the left 
inferior lobe passes largely to the right side.
• Lymph from the parietal pleura drains into lymph nodes of the 
thoracic wall (Fig. 3.71).
Lung cancer (carcinoma) metastasizes early to the broncho-
pulmonary lymph nodes and subsequently to the other thoracic 
lymph nodes. Common sites of hematogenous metastases 
(spreading through the blood) of cancer cells from a broncho-
genic carcinoma are the brain, bones, lungs, and suprarenal 
glands. Often the lymph nodes superior to the clavicle—the supra-
clavicular lymph nodes—are enlarged when lung (bronchogenic) 
carcinoma develops owing to metastasis of cancer cells from the 
tumor. Consequently, the supraclavicular nodes were once re-
ferred to as sentinel lymph nodes. More recently, the term sentinel 
lymph node has been applied to a node or nodes that  rst receive 
lymph drainage from a cancer-containing area, regardless of loca-
tion, following injection of blue dye containing radioactive tracer 
(technetium-99).

Ribs/Costal cartilages:
• The superior border of the heart is represented by a slightly oblique 
line joining the 3rd costal cartilages; the convex right side of the 
heart projects lateral to the sternum and inferiorly, lying at the 6th or 
7th costochondral junction; the inferior border of the heart is lying 
superior to the central tendon of the diaphragm and sloping slightly 
inferiorly to the apex at the 5th interspace at the midclavicular line.
•  The right dome of the diaphragm is higher than the left because 
of the large size of the liver inferior to the dome; during expira-
tion, the right dome reaches as high as the 5th rib and the left 
dome ascends to the 5th intercostal space.
•  The left pleural cavity is smaller than the right because of the 
projection of the heart to the left side.

• The right ventricle forms most of the sternocostal surface.
• The entire right auricle and much of the right atrium are visible 
anteriorly, but only a small portion of the left auricle is visible; 
the auricles, like a closing claw, grasp the origins of the pulmo-

• The ligamentum arteriosum passes from the origin of the left 
pulmonary artery to the arch of the aorta.
• The right coronary artery courses in the anterior atrioventricu-
lar groove, and the anterior interventricular branch of the left 
coronary artery (anterior descending branch) courses in or par-
allel to the anterior interventricular groove (see Fig. 3.43B).
•  The left vagus nerve passes lateral to the arch of the aorta and 
then posterior to the root of the lung; the left recurrent laryn-
geal nerve passes inferior to the arch of the aorta posterior to the 
ligamentum arteriosum.
•  The great cardiac vein ascends beside the anterior interventricu-
lar branch of the left coronary artery to drain into the coronary 
sinus posteriorly.

of heart
• This heart (A) was removed from the interior of the pericardial 
sac (B).
• The entire base, or posterior surface, and part of the diaphrag-
matic or inferior surface of the heart are in view (inset).
• The superior vena cava and larger inferior vena cava join the 
superior and inferior aspects of the right atrium.
• The left atrium forms the greater part of the base (posterior sur-
face) of the heart (inset).
• The left coronary artery in this specimen is dominant, since it 
supplies the posterior interventricular branch.
• Most branches of cardiac veins cross branches of the coronary 
arteries super cially.
• The visceral layer of serous pericardium (epicardium) covers the 
surface of the heart and re ects onto the great vessels; from 
around the great vessels, the serous pericardium re ects to line 
the internal aspect of the  brous pericardium as the parietal 
layer of serous pericardium. The  brous pericardium and the 
parietal layer of serous pericardium form the pericardial sac that 
encases the heart.
•  Note the cut edges of the re ections of serous pericardia around 
the arterial vessels (the pulmonary trunk and aorta) and venous 
vessels (the superior and inferior venae cavae and the pulmo-
nary veins).
•  Surgical isolation of cardiac out ow. The transverse pericardial 
sinus is especially important to cardiac surgeons. After the peri-
cardial sac has been opened anteriorly, a  nger can be passed 
through the transverse pericardial sinus posterior to the aorta 
and pulmonary trunk. By passing a surgical clamp or placing a 
ligature around these vessels, inserting the tubes of a coronary 
bypass machine, and then tightening the ligature, surgeons 
can stop or divert the circulation of blood in these large arteries 
while performing cardiac surgery.

EXTERNAL HEART  Thorax

• Interior of pericardial sac. Eight vessels were severed to excise 
the heart: superior and inferior venae cavae, four pulmonary 
veins, and two pulmonary arteries.
• The oblique sinus is bounded anteriorly by the visceral layer of 
serous pericardium covering the left atrium (A), posteriorly by 
the parietal layer of serous pericardium lining the  brous peri-
cardium, and superiorly and laterally by the re ection of serous 
pericardium around the four pulmonary veins and the superior 
and inferior venae cavae (B).
• The transverse sinus is bounded anteriorly by the serous pericar-
dium covering the posterior aspect of the pulmonary trunk and 
aorta and posteriorly by the visceral pericardium re ecting from 
the atria (A) inferiorly and the superior vena cava superiorly on 
the right.
•  Blood in the pericardial cavity, hemopericardium, produces 
cardiac tamponade. Hemopericardium may result from perfo-
ration of a weakened area of the heart muscle owing to a previ-
ous myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack, from bleeding 
into the pericardial cavity after cardiac operations, or from 
stab wounds. Heart volume is increasingly compromised and 
circulation fails.

Surgical exposure of venae cavae. After ascending through 
the diaphragm, the entire thoracic part of the inferior vena cava 
(IVC) (approximately 2 cm) is enclosed by the pericardium. Conse-
quently, the pericardial sac must be opened to expose the terminal 
part of the IVC. The same is true for the terminal part of the supe-
rior vena cava (SVC), which is partly inside and partly outside the 
pericardial sac.

•  In the most common pattern, the right coro-
nary artery travels in the coronary sulcus to 
reach the posterior surface of the heart, where 
it anastomoses with the circum ex branch of 
the left coronary artery. Early in its course, it 
gives off the right atrial branch, which supplies 
the sino-atrial (SA) node via its sino-atrial nodal 
branch. Major branches are a marginal branch 
supplying much of the anterior wall of the right 
ventricle, an atrioventricular (AV) nodal branch 
given off near the posterior border of the in-
terventricular septum, and a posterior interven-
tricular branch in the interventricular groove 
that anastomoses with the anterior interven-
tricular branch of the left coronary artery.
• The left coronary artery divides into a circum ex 
branch that passes posteriorly to anastomose 
with the right coronary artery on the posterior 
aspect of the heart and an anterior interventric-
ular branch in the interventricular groove; the 
origin of the SA nodal branch is variable and 
may be a branch of the left coronary artery.
•  The interventricular septum receives its blood 
supply from septal branches of the two inter-
ventricular (descending) branches: typically 
the anterior two thirds from the left coronary, 
and the posterior one third from the right (C).

The coronary sinus is the major venous drainage vessel of the 
heart; it is located posteriorly in the atrioventricular (coronary) 
groove and drains into the right atrium. The great, middle, and 
small cardiac veins; the oblique vein of the left atrium; and the 
posterior vein of the left ventricle are the principal vessels draining 
into the coronary sinus. The anterior cardiac veins drain directly 
into the right atrium. The smallest cardiac veins (venae cordis mini-
mae) drain the myocardium directly into the atria and ventricles 
(B). The cardiac veins accompany the coronary arteries and their 
branches.

Coronary artery disease (CAD), one of the leading causes of 
death, results in a reduced blood supply to the vital myocardial 
tissue. The three most common sites of coronary artery occlusion 
and the approximate percentage of occlusions involving each 
artery are the (1) anterior interventricular (clinically referred to 
as LAD) branch of the left coronary artery (LCA) (40% to 50%), 
(2) right coronary artery (RCA) (30% to 40%), and (3) circum ex 
branch of the LCA (15% to 20%).

CONDUCTION SYSTEM OF HEART
A. Impulses (arrows) initiated at the sino-atrial node. B. Atrioventricular (AV) node, 
AV bundle, and bundle branches. C. Echocardiogram, apical four-chamber view.
• The sino-atrial (SA) node is in the wall of the right atrium near the superior 
end of the sulcus terminalis (internally crista terminalis) at the opening of the 
superior vena cava. The SA node is the “pacemaker” of the heart because it 
initiates muscle contraction and determines the heart rate. It is supplied by 
the sino-atrial nodal artery, usually a branch of the right atrial branch of the 
right coronary artery, but it may arise from the left coronary artery.
• Contraction spreads through the atrial wall (myogenic induction) until it 
reaches the AV node in the interatrial septum, superomedial to the opening 
of the coronary sinus. The AV node is supplied by the AV nodal artery, usually 
arising from the right coronary artery posteriorly at the inferior margin of the 
interatrial septum.
• The AV bundle, usually supplied by the right coronary artery, passes from the 
AV node in the membranous part of the interventricular septum, dividing 
into right and left bundle branches on either side of the muscular part of the 
interventricular septum.
• The right bundle branch travels inferiorly in the interventricular septum to 
the anterior wall of the ventricle, with part passing via the septomarginal 
trabecula to the anterior papillary muscle; excitation spreads throughout 
the right ventricular wall through a network of subendocardial branches 
(Purkinje  bers) from the right bundle.
• The left bundle branch lies beneath the endocardium on the left side of 
the interventricular septum and branches to enter the anterior and posterior 
papillary muscles and the wall of the left ventricle; further branching into 
a plexus of subendocardial branches allows the impulses to be conveyed 
throughout the left ventricular wall. The bundle branches are mostly sup-
plied by the left coronary artery except the posterior limb of the left bundle 
branch, which is supplied by both coronary arteries.
• Damage to the cardiac conduction system (often by compromised blood 
supply as in coronary artery disease) leads to disturbances of muscle con-
traction. Damage to the AV node results in “heart block” because the atrial 
excitation wave does not reach the ventricles, which begin to contract 
independently at their own slower rate. Damage to one of the bundle 
branches results in “bundle branch block,” in which excitation goes down 
the unaffected branch to cause systole of that ventricle; the impulse then 
spreads to the other ventricle, producing later asynchronous contraction.

CONDUCTION SYSTEM OF HEART, CORONAL SECTION

 
INTERNAL HEART AND VALVES  Thorax 
251
A. Ventricular diastole. B. Ventricular systole. C. Correlation of ven-
tricular pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), and heart sounds. The 
cardiac cycle describes the complete movement of the heart or heart-
beat and includes the period from the beginning of one heartbeat to 
the beginning of the next one. The cycle consists of diastole (ven-
tricular relaxation and  lling) and systole (ventricular contraction and 
emptying). The right heart is the pump for the pulmonary circuit; 
the left heart is the pump for the systemic circuit (see Fig. 3.43C). 
D. Cardiac skeleton. The  brous framework of dense collagen forms 
four  brous rings, which provide attachment for the lea ets and 
cusps of the valves, and two  brous trigones that connect the rings, 
and the membranous parts of the interatrial and interventricular 
septa. The  brous skeleton keeps the ori ces of the valves patent and 
separates the myenterically conducted impulses of the atria.
Disorders involving the valves of the heart disturb the pumping 
ef ciency of the heart. Valvular heart disease produces either ste-
nosis (narrowing) or insuf ciency. Valvular stenosis is the failure of 
a valve to open fully, slowing blood  ow from a chamber. Valvular 
insuf ciency, or regurgitation, is the failure of the valve to close 
completely, usually owing to nodule formation on (or scarring and 
contraction of) the cusps so that the edges do not meet or align. 
This allows a variable amount of blood (depending on the severity) 
to  ow back into the chamber it was just ejected from. Both steno-
sis and insuf ciency result in an increased workload for the heart. 
Because valvular diseases are mechanical problems, damaged or 
defective cardiac valves are often replaced surgically in a procedure 
called valvuloplasty.

venae cavae.
• The smooth part of the atrial wall is formed by the absorption of 
the right horn of the sinus venosus, and the rough part is formed 
from the primitive atrium.
• Crista terminalis, the valve of the inferior vena cava, and the valve 
of the coronary sinus separate the smooth part from the rough part.
• The pectinate muscle passes anteriorly from the crista terminalis; 
the crista underlies the sulcus terminalis (not shown), a groove 
visible externally on the posterolateral surface of the right atrium 
between the superior and inferior venae cavae.
• The superior and inferior venae cavae and the coronary sinus open 
onto the smooth part of the right atrium; the anterior cardiac veins 
and venae cordis minimae (not visible) also open into the atrium.
• The  oor of the fossa ovalis is the remnant of the fetal septum pri-
mum; the crescent-shaped ridge (limbus fossae ovalis) partially 
surrounding the fossa is the remnant of the septum secundum.
•  In ow from the superior vena cava is directed toward the tricus-
pid ori ce, whereas blood from the inferior vena cava is directed 
toward the fossa ovalis (B).
•  Congenital anomalies of the interatrial septum, most often in-
complete closure of the oval foramen (patent foramen ovale), 
are atrial septal defects (ASDs). A probe-size patency is present 
in the superior part of the oval fossa in 15% to 25% of adults 
(Moore et al., 2012). These small openings, by themselves, cause 
no hemodynamic abnormalities. Large ASDs allow oxygenated 
blood from the lungs to be shunted from the left atrium through 
the ASD into the right atrium, causing enlargement of the right 
atrium and ventricle and dilation of the pulmonary trunk.

INTERNAL HEART AND VALVES  Thorax 
253
A. Interior of right ventricle. B. Blood  ow through right heart.
• The entrance to this chamber, the right atrioventricular or tri-
cuspid ori ce, is situated posteriorly; the exit, the ori ce of the 
pulmonary trunk, is superior.
• The out ow portion of the chamber inferior to the pulmonary 
ori ce (conus arteriosus or infundibulum) has a smooth, funnel-
shaped wall; the remainder of the ventricle is rough with  eshy 
trabeculae.
• There are three types of trabeculae: mere ridges, bridges 
attached only at each end, and  ngerlike projections called 
papillary muscles. The anterior papillary muscle rises from the 
anterior wall, the posterior (papillary muscle) from the posterior 
wall, and a series of small septal papillae from the septal wall.
•  The septomarginal trabecula, here thick, extends from the 
septum to the base of the anterior papillary muscle.
•  The membranous part of the interventricular septum devel-
ops separately from the muscular part and has a complex 
embryological origin (Moore et al., 2012). Consequently, this 
part is the common site of ventricular septal defects (VSDs), 
although defects also occur in the muscular part. VSDs rank 
 rst on all lists of cardiac defects. The size of the defect var-
ies from 1 to 25 mm. A VSD causes a left-to-right shunt of 
blood through the defect. A large shunt increases pulmonary 
blood  ow, which causes severe pulmonary disease (pulm o-
nary hypertension, or increased blood pressure) and may 
cause cardiac failure.

tion (spreading) of the left heart wall on each side of the incision.
•  The entrances (pulmonary veins) to the left atrium are posterior, 
and the exit (left atrioventricular or mitral ori ce) is anterior.
•  The left side of the fossa ovalis is also seen on the left side of the 
interatrial septum, although the left side is not usually as distinct 
as the right side is within the right atrium.

A. Excised heart.
• The ventricles are positioned anteriorly and to the left, the 
atria posteriorly and to the right.
• The roots of the aorta and pulmonary artery, which conduct 
blood from the ventricles, are placed anterior to the atria.
• The aorta and pulmonary artery are enclosed within a 
common tube of serous pericardium and partly embraced by 
the auricles of the atria.
• The transverse pericardial sinus curves posterior to the 
enclosed stems of the aorta and pulmonary trunk and anterior 
to the superior vena cava and upper limits of the atria.
B. Developmental basis for naming of pulmonary and aortic 
valve cusps. The truncus arteriosus with four cusps (I) splits to 
form two valves, each with three cusps (II). The heart undergoes 
partial rotation to the left on its axis, resulting in the arrange-
ment of cusps shown in (III).

A. and B. Atrioventricular valves. C. and D. Semilunar valves.
Tendinous cords pass from the tips of the papillary muscles to 
the free margins and ventricular surfaces of the cusps of the tri-
cuspid (A) and mitral (B) valves. Each papillary muscle or muscle 
group controls the adjacent sides of two cusps, resisting valve pro-
lapse during systole. In C the anulus of the aortic valve has been 
incised between the right and left cusps and spread open. Each 
cusp of the semilunar valves bears a nodule in the midpoint of its 
free edge,  anked by thin connective tissue areas (lunules). When 
the ventricles relax to  ll (diastole), back ow of blood from aor-
tic recoil or pulmonary resistance  lls the sinus (space between 
cusp and dilated part of the aortic or pulmonary wall), causing 
the nodules and lunules to meet centrally, closing the valve (D, 
left). Filling of the coronary arteries occurs during diastole (when 
ventricular walls are relaxed) as back ow “in ates” the cusps to 
close the valve.

A. Dissection I: Thymus in situ.  The sternum and ribs have been 
excised and the pleurae removed. It is unusual in an adult to see such 
a discrete thymus, which is large during puberty but subsequently 
regresses and is for the most part replaced by fat and  brous tissue. 
B. Dissection II: Thymus removed. C. Relationship of nerves and 
vessels. The right vagus nerve (CN X) crosses anterior to the right 
subclavian artery and gives off the right recurrent laryngeal nerve, 
which passes medially to reach the trachea and esophagus. The left 
recurrent laryngeal nerve passes inferior and then posterior to the 
arch of the aorta and ascends between the trachea and esophagus 
to the larynx.
The distal part of the ascending aorta receives a strong thrust 
of blood when the left ventricle contracts. Because its wall is not 
reinforced by  brous pericardium (the  brous pericardium blends 
with the aortic adventitia at the beginning of the arch), an aneu-
rysm may develop. An aortic aneurysm is evident on chest  lm 
(radiograph of the thorax) or a magnetic resonance angiogram as 
an enlarged area of the ascending aorta silhouette. Individuals with 
an aneurysm usually complain of chest pain that radiates to the 
back. The aneurysm may exert pressure on the trachea, esopha-
gus, and recurrent laryngeal nerve, causing dif culty in breathing 
and swallowing.
Mediastinal compression. The recurrent laryngeal nerves sup-
ply all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, except the cricothyroid. 
Consequently, any investigative procedure or disease process in 
the superior mediastinum may involve these nerves and affect the 
voice. Because the left recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks around the 
arch of the aorta and ascends between the trachea and the esoph-
agus, it may be involved when there is a bronchial or esophageal 
carcinoma, enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, or an aneu-
rysm of the arch of the aorta.
The thymus is a prominent feature during infancy and childhood. 
In some infants, the thymus may compress the trachea. The thymus 
plays an important role in the development and maintenance of the 
immune system. As puberty is reached, the thymus begins to dimin-
ish in relative size. By adulthood, it is replaced by adipose tissue.

inferior to this site (postductal coarctation), a good collateral cir-
culation usually develops between the proximal and distal parts 
of the aorta through the intercostal and internal thoracic arteries.

Heart. Sympathetic stimulation increases the heart’s rate and 
the force of its contractions. Parasympathetic stimulation slows 
the heart rate, reduces the force of contraction, and constricts 
the coronary arteries, saving energy between periods of increased 
demand. While the cardiac plexus is shown in relation to the 
bifurcation of the trachea, note that it lies directly posterior to the 
superior margin of the heart (see Fig. 3.28C) and in close proximity 
to the nodal tissue and origins of the coronary arteries.
Lungs. Sympathetic  bers are inhibitory to the bronchial muscle 
(bronchodilator), motor to pulmonary vessels (vasoconstrictor), 
and inhibitory to the alveolar glands of the bronchial tree. Para-
sympathetic  bers from CN X are bronchoconstrictors, secretory 
to the glands of the bronchial tree (secretomotor).

A. The diaphragmatic pleura is mostly removed.  The pericardial 
sac is situated on the anterior half of the diaphragm; one third is 
to the right of the median plane, and two thirds to the left. Note 
also that anterior to the pericardium, the sternal re ection of the 
left pleural sac approaches but fails to meet that of the right sac 
in the median plane; and on reaching the vertebral column, the 
costal pleura becomes the mediastinal pleura.
Irritation of the parietal pleura produces local pain and 
referred pain to the areas sharing innervation by the same seg-
ments of the spinal cord. Irritation of the costal and periph-
eral parts of the diaphragmatic pleura results in local pain 
and referred pain along the intercostal nerves to the thoracic 
and abdominal walls. Irritation of the mediastinal and central 
diaphragmatic parts of the parietal pleura results in pain that 
is referred to the root of the neck and over the shoulder (C3–C5 
dermatomes). B. Between the inferior part of the esophagus 
and the aorta, the right and left layers of mediastinal pleura 
form a dorsal meso-esophagus, especially when the body is in 
the prone position.

• The anterior relations of the thoracic part of the esophagus from 
superior to inferior are the trachea (from origin at cricoid cartilage 
to bifurcation), right and left bronchi, inferior tracheobronchial 
lymph nodes, pericardium (not shown) and,  nally, the diaphragm.
• The arch of the aorta passes posterior to the left of these four 
structures as it arches over the left main bronchus; the arch of 
the azygos vein passes anterior to their right as it arches over the 
right main bronchus.
•  Esophageal im pressions. The impressions produced in the 
esophagus by adjacent structures (aorta, left main bronchus, 
and esophageal hiatus) are of clinical interest because of the 
slower passage of substances at these sites. The impressions 
indicate where swallowed foreign bodies are most likely to 
lodge and where a stricture may develop after the accidental 
drinking of a caustic liquid such as lye.

A. and B. Arteries of trachea and esophagus. The continuous 
anastomotic chain of arteries on the esophagus is formed (1) by 
branches of the right and left inferior thyroid and right supreme 
intercostal arteries superiorly, (2) by the unpaired median aortic 
(bronchial and esophageal) branches, and (3) by branches of the 
left gastric and left inferior phrenic arteries inferiorly. The right 
bronchial artery usually arises from the superior left bronchial or 
3rd right posterior intercostal artery (here the 5th) or from the 
aorta directly. The unpaired median aortic branches also supply 
the trachea and bronchi. C. Branches of the thoracic aorta.

• The descending aorta is located to the left, and the azygos vein 
slightly to the right of the midline.
• The thoracic duct (1) originates from the cisterna chyli at the 
T12 vertebral level, (2) ascends on the vertebral column be-
tween the azygos vein and the descending aorta, (3) passes to 
the left at the junction of the posterior and superior mediastina, 
and continues its ascent to the neck, where (4) it arches laterally 
to enter the venous system near or at the angle of union of the 
left internal jugular and subclavian veins (left venous angle).
• The thoracic duct is commonly plexiform (resembling a network) 
in the posterior mediastinum.
•  The termination of the thoracic duct typically receives the left 
jugular, subclavian, and bronchomediastinal trunks.
•  The right lymph duct is short and formed by the union of the 
right jugular, subclavian, and bronchomediastinal trunks.
•  Because the thoracic duct is thin-walled and may be colorless, it 
may not be easily identi ed. Consequently, it is vulnerable to in-
advertent injury during investigative and/or surgical procedures 
in the posterior mediastinum. Laceration of the thoracic duct 
results in chyle escaping into the thoracic cavity. Chyle may also 
enter the pleural cavity, producing chylothorax.

veins connect the common iliac veins to the lumbar veins and 
join the subcostal veins to become the lateral roots of the azygos 
and hemi-azygos veins; the medial roots of the azygos and hemi- 
azygos veins are usually from the inferior vena cava and left renal 
vein, if present. Typically, the upper four left posterior intercostal 
veins drain into the left brachiocephalic vein, directly and via the 
left superior intercostal veins.
The hemi-azygos, accessory hemi-azygos, and left superior inter-
costals veins are continuous in A, but most commonly, they are 
discontinuous as in B. The hemi-azygos vein crosses the vertebral 
column at approximately T9, and the accessory hemi-azygos vein 
crosses at T8, to enter the azygos vein (B). In contrast, there are 
four cross-connecting channels between the azygos and hemi-
azygos systems in A. The azygos vein arches superior to the root of 
the right lung at T4 to drain into the superior vena cava.

The azygos, hemi-azygos, and accessory hemi-azygos veins offer al-
ternate means of venous drainage from the thoracic, abdominal, and 
back regions when obstruction of the IVC occurs. In some people, 
an accessory azygos vein parallels the main azygos vein on the right 
side. Other people have no hemi-azygos system of veins. A clinically 
important variation, although uncommon, is when the azygos system 
receives all the blood from the IVC, except that from the liver. In these 
people, the azygos system drains nearly all the blood inferior to the 
diaphragm, except that from the digestive tract. When obstruction 
of the SVC occurs superior to the entrance of the azygos vein, blood 
can drain inferiorly into the veins of the abdominal wall and return to 
the right atrium through the IVC and azygos system of veins.

• The costal and mediastinal pleurae have mostly been removed, 
exposing the underlying structures. Compare with the mediasti-
nal surface of the right lung in Figure 3.32.
• The right side of the mediastinum is the “blue side,” dominated 
by the arch of the azygos vein and the superior vena cava.
• Both the trachea and the esophagus are visible from the right side.
•  The right vagus nerve descends on the medial surface of the 
trachea, passes medial to the arch of the azygos vein, posterior 
to the root of the lung, and then enters the esophageal plexus.
•  The right phrenic nerve passes anterior to the root of the lung 
lateral to both venae cavae.

MEDIASTINUM, RIGHT SIDE

•  Compare with the mediastinal surface of the left lung in 
Figure 3.33.
• The left side of the mediastinum is the “red side,” dominated by 
the arch and descending portion of the aorta, the left common 
carotid and subclavian arteries; the latter obscure the trachea 
from view.
•  The thoracic duct can be seen on the left side of the esophagus.
•  The left vagus nerve passes posterior to the root of the lung, 
sending its recurrent laryngeal branch around the ligamentum 
arteriosum inferior and then medial to the aortic arch.
•  The phrenic nerve passes anterior to the root of the lung and 
penetrates the diaphragm more anteriorly than on the right side.

• In this specimen, the parietal pleura is intact on the left side and 
partially removed on the right side. A portion of the esophagus, 
between the bifurcation of the trachea and the diaphragm, is 
also removed.
• The thoracic sympathetic trunk is connected to each intercostal 
nerve by rami communicantes.
•  The greater splanchnic nerve is formed by  bers from the 5th 
to 10th thoracic sympathetic ganglia, and the lesser splanchnic 
nerve receives  bers from the 10th and 11th thoracic ganglia. 
Both nerves contain presynaptic and visceral afferent  bers.
•  The azygos vein ascends anterior to the intercostal vessels and 
to the right of the thoracic duct and aorta and drains into the 
superior vena cava.

• The thoracic vertebral column and thoracic cage are removed 
on the right. On the left, the ribs and intercostal musculature are 
removed posteriorly as far laterally as the angles of the ribs. The 
parietal pleura is intact on the left side but partially removed on 
the right to reveal the visceral pleura covering the right lung.
•  The azygos vein is on the right side, and the hemi-azygos vein is 
on the left, crossing the midline (usually at T9 but higher in this 
specimen) to join the azygos vein. The accessory hemi-azygos 
vein is absent in this specimen; instead, three most superior pos-
terior intercostal veins drain directly into the azygos vein.

A. Innervation of heart. B–D. Areas of cardiac referred pain (red). 
E. Innervation of posterior and superior mediastina.
The heart is insensitive to touch, cutting, cold, and heat; however, 
ischemia and the accumulation of metabolic products stimulate 
pain endings in the myocardium. The afferent pain  bers run cen-
trally in the middle and inferior cervical branches and especially in 
the thoracic cardiac branches of the sympathetic trunk. The axons 
of these primary sensory neurons enter spinal cord segments T1 
through T4 or T5, especially on the left side.
Cardiac referred pain is a phenomenon whereby noxious stim-
uli originating in the heart are perceived by a person as pain aris-
ing from a super cial part of the body—the skin on the left upper 
limb, for example. Visceral referred pain is transmitted by visceral 
afferent  bers accompanying sympathetic  bers and is typically re-
ferred to somatic structures or areas such as a limb having afferent 
 bers with cell bodies in the same spinal ganglion, and central 
processes that enter the spinal cord through the same posterior 
roots (Hardy & Naftel, 2001).
Anginal pain is commonly felt as radiating from the substernal 
and left pectoral regions to the left shoulder and the medial aspect of 
the left upper limb (B). This part of the limb is supplied by the medial 
cutaneous nerve of the arm. Often, the lateral cutaneous branches of 
the 2nd and 3rd intercostal nerves (the intercostobrachial nerves) join 
or overlap in their distribution with the medial cutaneous nerve of the 
arm. Consequently, cardiac pain is referred to the upper limb because 
the spinal cord segments of these cutaneous nerves (T1–T3) are also 
common to the visceral afferent terminations for the coronary arter-
ies. Synaptic contacts may also be made with commissural (connec-
tor) neurons, which conduct impulses to neurons on the right side 
of comparable areas of the spinal cord. This occurrence explains why 
pain of cardiac origin, although usually referred to the left side, may 
be referred to the right side, both sides, or the back (C and D).

Surface features.
• The umbilicus is where the umbilical cord entered the fetus and 
indicates the anterior level of the T10 dermatome. Typically, the 
umbilicus lies at the level of the intervertebral disc between the 
L3 and L4 vertebrae.
• The linea alba is a  brous band formed by the fusion of the right 
and left abdominal aponeuroses between the xiphoid process 
and the pubic symphysis demarcated super cially by a midline 
vertical skin groove.
•  A curved skin groove, the linea semilunaris, demarcates the lat-
eral border of the right and left rectus abdominis muscles and 
rectus sheath.
•  In lean individuals with good muscle development, three to four 
transverse skin grooves overlie the tendinous intersections of the 
rectus abdominis muscle.
• The site of the inguinal ligament is indicated by a skin crease, the in-
guinal groove, just inferior and parallel to the ligament, marking the 
division between the anterolateral abdominal wall and the thigh.

A. Quadrants. B. Regions.  It is important to know what organs are 
located in each abdominal region or quadrant so that one knows 
where to auscultate, percuss, and palpate them and to record the 
locations of  ndings during a physical exam.
The six common causes of abdominal protrusion begin with 
the letter F: food,  uid, fat, feces,  atus, and fetus. Eversion of the 
umbilicus may be a sign of increased intra-abdominal pressure, 
usually resulting from ascites (abdominal accumulation of serous 
 uid in the peritoneal cavity), or a large mass (e.g., a tumor, fetus, 
or enlarged organ such as the liver [hepatomegaly]).
Warm hands are important when palpating the abdominal wall 
because cold hands make the anterolateral abdominal muscles 
tense, producing involuntary muscle spasms known as guarding. In-
tense guarding, boardlike re exive muscular rigidity that cannot be 
willfully suppressed, occurs during palpation when an organ (such 
as the appendix) is in amed and in itself constitutes a clinically sig-
ni cant sign of acute abdomen. The involuntary muscular spasms 
attempt to protect the viscera from pressure, which is painful when 
an abdominal infection is present. The common nerve supply of 
the skin and muscles of the wall explains why these spasms occur.

Abdomen  
ANTEROLATERAL ABDOMINAL WALL
The thoraco-abdominal (T7–T11) nerves run between the external 
and internal oblique muscles to supply sensory innervation to the 
overlying skin. The T10 nerve supplies the region of the umbilicus. 
The subcostal nerve (T12) runs along the inferior border of the 
12th rib to supply the skin over the anterior superior iliac spine 
and hip. The iliohypogastric nerve (L1) innervates the skin over the 
iliac crest and lower pubic region and the ilio-inguinal nerve (L1) 
innervates the skin of the medial aspect of the thigh, the scrotum 
or labium majus, and mons pubis.

ANTEROLATERAL ABDOMINAL WALL  Abdomen

The skin and muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall are sup-
plied mainly by the:
• Thoraco-abdominal nerves: distal, abdominal parts of the ante-
rior rami of the inferior six thoracic spinal nerves (T7–T11), which 
have muscular branches and anterior and lateral abdominal 
cutaneous branches. The anterior abdominal cutaneous branches 
pierce the rectus sheath a short distance from the median plane, 
after the rectus abdominis muscle has been supplied. Spinal 
nerves T7–T9 supply the skin superior to the umbilicus; T10 in-
nervates the skin around the umbilicus.
• Spinal nerve T11, plus the cutaneous branches of the subcostal 
(T12), iliohypogastric, and ilio-inguinal (L1) nerves: supply the 
skin inferior to the umbilicus.
• Subcostal nerve: large anterior ramus of spinal nerve T12.
The blood vessels of the anterolateral abdominal wall are the:
• Superior epigastric vessels and branches of the musculophrenic 
vessels, the terminal branches of the internal thoracic vessels.
•  Inferior epigastric and deep circum ex iliac vessels from the ex-
ternal iliac vessels.
•  Super cial circum ex iliac and super cial epigastric vessels from 
the femoral artery and great saphenous vein.
•  Posterior intercostal vessels in the 11th intercostal space and an-
terior branches of subcostal vessels.
Incisional nerve injury. The inferior thoracic spinal nerves (T7–T12) 
and the iliohypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerves (L1) approach the 
abdominal musculature separately to provide the multisegmental 
innervation of the abdominal muscles. Thus, they are distributed 
across the anterolateral abdominal wall, where they run oblique 
but mostly horizontal courses. They are susceptible to injury in 
surgical incisions or from trauma at any level of the abdominal 
wall. Injury to them may result in weakening of the muscles. In the 
inguinal region, such a weakness may predispose an individual to 
development of an inguinal hernia.

ANTEROLATERAL ABDOMINAL WALL
The muscular portion of the external oblique muscle interdigitates 
with slips of the serratus anterior muscle, and the aponeurotic por-
tion contributes to the anterior wall of the rectus sheath. The an-
terior and posterior branches of the lateral abdominal cutaneous 
branches of the thoraco-abdominal nerves course super cially in 
the subcutaneous tissue.
• Umbilical hernias are usually small protrusions of extraperi-
toneal fat and/or peritoneum and omentum and sometimes 
bowel. They result from increased intra-abdominal pressure in 
the presence of weakness or incomplete closure of the anterior 
abdominal wall after ligation of the umbilical cord at birth, or 
may be acquired later, most commonly in women and obese 
people.
•  The lines along which the  bers of the abdominal aponeuro-
sis interlace (see Fig. 4.10A, B, and D) are also potential sites 
of herniation. These gaps may be congenital, the result of the 
stresses of obesity and aging, or the consequence of surgical or 
traumatic wounds.

A. Overview.
• The skin and subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall are served 
by an intricate subcutaneous venous plexus, draining superiorly to 
the internal thoracic vein medially and the lateral thoracic vein lat-
erally, and inferiorly to the super cial and inferior epigastric veins, 
tributaries of the femoral and external iliac veins, respectively.
• Super cial lymphatic vessels accompany the subcutaneous veins; 
those superior to the transumbilical plane drain mainly to the 
axillary lymph nodes; however, a few drain to the parasternal 
lymph nodes. Super cial lymphatic vessels inferior to the trans-
umbilical plane drain to the super cial inguinal lymph nodes.
B. Enlargement of subcutaneous veins.
•  Liposuction is a surgical method for removing unwanted subcu-
taneous fat using a percutaneously placed suction tube and high 
vacuum pressure. The tubes are inserted subdermally through 
small skin incisions.
•  When  ow in the superior or inferior vena cava is obstructed, 
anastomoses between the tributaries of these systemic veins, such 
as the thoraco-epigastric vein, may provide collateral pathways 
by which the obstruction may be bypassed, allowing blood to 
return to the heart. The veins become enlarged and tortuous (B).

A. Super cial dissection demonstrating the relationship of the cutaneous 
nerves and super cial vessels to the musculoaponeurotic structures. 
 The anterior wall of the left rectus sheath is re ected, revealing the 
rectus abdominis muscle, segmented by tendinous intersections.
• After the T7 to T12 spinal nerves supply the muscles, their an-
terior abdominal cutaneous branches emerge from the rectus 
abdominis muscle and pierce the anterior wall of its sheath.
• The three super cial inguinal branches of the femoral artery 
(super cial circum ex iliac artery, super cial epigastric artery, 
and external pudendal artery) and the great saphenous vein lie 
in the fatty layer of subcutaneous tissue.
• The  bers of the external oblique aponeurosis separate into me-
dial and lateral crura, which, with the intercrural  bers that unite 
them, form the super cial inguinal ring. The spermatic cord of 
the male (shown here), or round ligament of the female, exits 
the inguinal canal through the super cial inguinal ring along 
with the ilio-inguinal nerve.

B. Deep dissection. On the right side of the specimen, most of the 
external oblique muscle is excised. On the left, the internal oblique 
muscle is divided and the rectus abdominis muscle is excised, re-
vealing the posterior wall of the rectus sheath.
• The  bers of the internal oblique muscle run horizontally at the 
level of the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), obliquely upward 
superior to the ASIS, and obliquely downward inferior to the ASIS.
• The arcuate line is at the level of the ASIS; inferior to the line, trans-
versalis fascia lies immediately posterior to the rectus abdominis 
muscle.
•  Initially, the anterior abdominal branches of the anterior rami 
course between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis 
muscles.
•  The anastomosis between the superior and inferior epigastric 
arteries indirectly unites the subclavian artery of the upper limb 
to the external iliac arteries of the lower limb. The anastomosis 
can become functionally patent in response to slowly develop-
ing occlusion of the aorta.

aApproximately 80% of people have a pyramidalis muscle, which is located in the rectus sheath anterior to the most inferior part of the rectus abdominis. It extends from the pubic crest of the hip bone to the linea 
alba. This small muscle tenses the linea alba.
bIn so doing, these muscles act as antagonists of the diaphragm to produce expiration.

A. Internal oblique and cremaster muscle. Part of the aponeurosis of the external oblique 
muscle is cut away, and the spermatic cord is cut short. B. Schematic illustration.
•  The cremaster fascia covers the spermatic cord. Cremaster muscle is dispersed 
within the cremasteric fascia.
•  The re ected ligament is formed by aponeurotic  bers of the external oblique mus-
cle and lies anterior to the conjoint tendon. The conjoint tendon is formed by the 
fusion of the inferior most parts of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique and trans-
versus abdominis muscles.

The inguinal canals in females are narrower than those in males, 
and the canals in infants of both sexes are shorter and much less 
oblique than in adults. For a complete description of the embry-
ology of the inguinal region, see Moore et al. (2012).
The fetal testes relocate from the dorsal abdominal wall in 
the superior lumbar region to the deep inguinal rings during 
the 9th to 12th fetal weeks. This movement probably results 
from the growth of the vertebral column and pelvis. The male 
gubernaculum, attached to the caudal pole of the testis and 
accompanied by an outpouching of peritoneum, the processus 
vaginalis, projects into the scrotum. The testis passes posterior 
to the processus vaginalis. The inferior remnant of the proces-
sus vaginalis forms the tunica vaginalis covering the testis. The 
ductus deferens, testicular vessels, nerves, and lymphatics ac-
company the testis. The  nal descent of the testis usually occurs 
before or shortly after birth.
The fetal ovaries also relocate from the dorsal abdominal wall 
in the superior lumbar region during the 12th week but pass 
into the lesser pelvis. The female gubernaculum attaches to the 
caudal pole of the ovary and projects into the labia majora, at-
taching en route to the uterus; the part passing from the uterus 
to the ovary forms the ovarian ligament, and the remainder of 
it becomes the round ligament of the uterus. Because of the 
attachment of the ovarian ligaments to the uterus, the ovaries 
do not relocate to the inguinal region; however, the round liga-
ment passes through the inguinal canal and attaches to the sub-
cutaneous tissue of the labium majus.

An inguinal hernia is a protrusion of parietal peritoneum and 
viscera, such as the small intestine, through the abdominal wall 
in the inguinal region. There are two major categories of inguinal 
hernia: indirect and direct. More than two thirds are indirect her-
nias, most commonly occurring in males.
COURSE OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT INGUINAL HERNIAS 
4.18
Characteristics
Direct (Acquired)
 
Indirect (Congenital)
Predisposing factors
Weakness of anterior abdominal wall in inguinal triangle (e.g., owing 
to distended super cial ring, narrow conjoint tendon, or attenuation 
of aponeurosis in males  40 years of age)
Patency of processus vaginalis (complete or at least of superior part) in 
younger persons, the great majority of whom are males
Frequency
Less common (one third to one fourth of inguinal hernias)
More common (two thirds to three fourths of inguinal hernias)
Coverings at exit from abdominal 
cavity
Peritoneum plus transversalis fascia (lies outside inner one or two fas-
cial coverings, parallel to cord)
Peritoneum of persistent processus vaginalis plus all three fascial coverings of 
cord/round ligament
Course
Usually traverses only medial third of inguinal canal, external and 
parallel to vestige of processus vaginalis
Traverses inguinal canal (entire canal if it is suf cient size) within processus 
vaginalis
Exit from anterior abdominal wall
Via super cial ring, lateral to cord; rarely enters scrotum
Via super cial ring inside cord, commonly passing into scrotum/labium majus

A. Dissection of spermatic cord. The subcutaneous tissue (dar-
tos fascia) covering the penis has been removed and the deep 
fascia rendered transparent to demonstrate the median deep 
dorsal vein and the bilateral dorsal arteries and nerves of the 
penis. On the specimen’s right, the coverings of the spermatic 
cord and testis are re ected, and the contents of the cord are 
separated. The testicular artery has been separated from the 
pampiniform plexus of veins that surrounds it as it courses par-
allel to the ductus deferens. Lymphatic vessels and autonomic 
nerve  bers (not shown) are also present. B. The tunica vagina-
lis has been incised longitudinally to expose its cavity, surround-
ing the testis anteriorly and laterally, and extending between 
the testis and epididymis at the sinus of the epididymis. The 
epididymis is located posterolateral to the testis, that is, toward 
the right side of the right testis and the left side of the left testis. 
The appendices of the testis and epididymis may be observed 
in some specimens. These structures are small remnants of the 
embryonic genital (paramesonephric) duct.

A. Blood supply. B. Internal structure. C. Lymphatic drainage.
Because the testes relocate from the posterior abdominal 
wall into the scrotum during fetal development, their lym-
phatic drainage differs from that of the scrotum, which is an 
outpouching of the abdominal skin. Consequently, cancer of the 
testis metastasizes initially to the lumbar lymph nodes, and can-
cer of the scrotum  metastasizes initially to the super cial ingui-
nal lymph nodes.

PERITONEUM AND PERITONEAL CAVITY
Umbilical folds (median, medial, and lateral) are re ections of the 
parietal peritoneum that are raised from the body wall by underly-
ing structures. The median umbilical fold extends from the urinary 
bladder to the umbilicus and covers the median umbilical ligament 
(the remnant of the urachus). The two medial umbilical folds cover 
the medial umbilical ligaments (occluded remnants of the fetal 
umbilical arteries). Two lateral umbilical folds cover the inferior 
epigastric vessels. The supravesical fossae are between the median 
and medial umbilical folds, the medial inguinal fossae (inguinal 
triangles) are between the medial and lateral umbilical folds, and 
the lateral inguinal fossae and deep inguinal rings are lateral to the 
lateral umbilical folds.

Peritoneal ligament
Double layer of peritoneum that connects an organ with another organ or to the abdominal wall.
Mesentery
Double layer of peritoneum that occurs as a result of the invagination of the peritoneum by one or more organs and constitutes a continuity of the visceral 
and parietal peritoneum.
Omentum
Double-layered extension of peritoneum passing from the proximal duodenum and/or stomach and to adjacent organs. The greater omentum extends from 
the greater curvature of the stomach and the proximal duodenum; the lesser omentum from the lesser curvature.
Bare area
Every organ must have an area, the bare area, that is not covered with visceral peritoneum, to allow the entrance and exit of neurovascular structures. Bare 
areas are formed in relation to the attachments of mesenteries, omenta, and ligaments. Named bare areas (e.g., bare area of liver) are especially extensive.

• When bacterial contamination occurs or when the gut is trau-
matically penetrated or ruptured as the result of infection and 
in ammation, gas, fecal matter, and bacteria enter the perito-
neal cavity. The result is infection and in ammation of the peri-
toneum, called peritonitis.
• Under certain pathological conditions such as peritonitis, the 
peritoneal cavity may be distended with abnormal  uid, ascites. 
Widespread metastases (spread) of cancer cells to the ab-
dominal viscera cause exudation (escape) of  uid that is often 
blood stained. Thus, the peritoneal cavity may be distended 
with several liters of abnormal  uid. Surgical puncture of the 
peritoneal cavity for the aspiration of drainage of  uid is called 
paracentesis.

The parietal peritoneum of the posterior wall of the omental bursa 
has been mostly removed, and a section of the pancreas has been 
excised. The rod passes through the omental foramen.
• The celiac trunk gives rise to the left gastric artery, the splenic 
artery that runs tortuously to the left, and the common hepatic 
artery that runs to the right, passing anterior to the hepatic por-
tal vein.
• The hepatic portal vein is formed posterior to the neck of the 
pancreas by the union of the superior mesenteric and splenic 
veins, with the inferior mesenteric vein joining at or near the 
angle of union.
•  The left testicular vein usually drains into the left renal vein. Both 
are systemic veins.
•  In ammation of the parietal peritoneum can occur due to an 
enlarged organ or by the escape of  uid from an organ. The area 
becomes in amed and causes pain over the affected region.
•  Rebound tenderness is a pain that is elicited after pressure over 
the in amed area is released.

Blockage of esophagus. The impressions pro-
duced in the esophagus by adjacent structures are of 
clinical interest because of the slower passage of sub-
stances at these sites. The impressions indicate where 
swallowed foreign objects are most likely to lodge 
and where a stricture may develop, for example, after 
the accidental drinking of a caustic liquid, such as lye.
A hiatal (hiatus) hernia is a protrusion of a part 
of the stomach into the mediastinum through the 
esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm. The hernias 
occur most often in people after middle age, possi-
bly because of weakening of the muscular part of the 
diaphragm and widening of the esophageal hiatus.

Abdomen  
PANCREAS, DUODENUM, AND SPLEEN
A. Anterior relationships. The gastroduodenal 
artery descends anterior to the neck of the pancreas. 
B. Posterior relationships. The splenic artery and 
vein course on the posterior aspect of the pancreatic 
tail, which usually extends to the spleen. The pan-
creas “loops” around the right side of the superior 
mesenteric vessels so that its neck is anterior, its 
head is to the right, and its uncinate process is pos-
terior to the vessels. The splenic and superior mes-
enteric veins unite posterior to the neck to form 
the hepatic portal vein. The bile duct descends in 
a  ssure (opened up) in the posterior part of the 
head of the pancreas.
Most in ammatory erosions of the duodenal 
wall, duodenal (peptic) ulcers, are in the poste-
rior wall of the superior (1st) part of the duodenum 
within 3 cm of the pylorus.

• The anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery 
from the gastroduodenal artery and the anterior

rior mesenteric artery form the anterior pancre-
aticoduodenal arch anterior to the head of the 
pancreas. The posterior superior and posterior in-
ferior branches of the same two arteries form the 
posterior pancreaticoduodenal arch posterior to 
the pancreas. The anterior and posterior inferior 
arteries often arise from a common stem.
• Arteries supplying the pancreas are derived from 
the common hepatic artery, gastroduodenal ar-
tery, pancreaticoduodenal arches, splenic artery, 
and superior mesenteric artery.

E. Diverticulosis is a disorder in which multiple false diverticula 
(external evaginations or outpocketings of the mucosa of the 
colon) develop along the intestine. It primarily affects middle-
aged and elderly people. Diverticulosis is commonly (60%) 
found in the sigmoid colon. Diverticula are subject to infection 
and rupture, leading to diverticulitis, and they can distort and 
erode the nutrient arteries, leading to hemorrhage.

• On the inset drawings of jejunum and ileum, compare the di-
ameter, thickness of wall, number of arterial arcades, long or 
short vasa recta, presence of translucent (fat-free) areas at the 
mesenteric border, and fat encroaching on the wall of the gut 
between the jejunum and ileum.
• Acute in ammation of the appendix is a common cause of 
an acute abdomen (severe abdominal pain arising suddenly). 
The pain of appendicitis usually commences as a vague pain in 
the peri-umbilical region because afferent pain  bers enter the 
spinal cord at the T10 level. Later, severe pain in the right lower 
quadrant results from irritation of the parietal peritoneum lining 
the posterior abdominal wall.

A. Branches of superior mesenteric artery. Consult Figure 4.44 to 
identify the branches. B. Enlargement to show the jejunal arteries, 
arterial arcades, and vasa recta.
• The branches of the superior mesenteric artery include, from its 
left side, 12 or more jejunal and ileal arteries that anastomose to 
form arcades from which vasa recta pass to the small intestine 
and, from its right side, the middle colic, ileocolic, and commonly 
(but not here) an independent right colic artery that anastomose 
to form a marginal artery that parallels the mesenteric border at 
the colon and from which vasa recta pass to the large intestine.
• Occlusion of the vasa recta by emboli results in ischemia of 
the part of the intestine concerned. If the ischemia is severe, 
necrosis of the involved segment results and ileus (obstruction 
of the intestine) of the paralytic type occurs. Ileus is accompa-
nied by a severe colicky pain, along with abdominal distension, 
vomiting, and often fever and dehydration. If the condition is 
diagnosed early (e.g., using a superior mesenteric arteriogram), 
the obstructed part of the vessel may be cleared surgically.

The mesentery of the small intestine has been cut at its root.
• The inferior mesenteric artery arises posterior to the ascending 
part of the duodenum, about 4 cm superior to the bifurcation of 
the aorta; on crossing the left common iliac artery, it becomes 
the superior rectal artery.
• The branches of the inferior mesenteric artery include the left 
colic artery and several sigmoid arteries; the inferior two sigmoid 
arteries branch from the superior rectal artery.
• The point at which the last sigmoidal artery branches from the 
superior rectal artery is known as the “critical point” of the su-
perior rectal artery; distal to this point, there are poor or no 
anastomotic connections between the superior rectal artery and 
the marginal artery.

• The superior rectal artery, which is the continuation of the infe-
rior mesenteric artery, supplies the rectum; the superior rectal 
anastomoses are formed by branches of the middle and inferior 
rectal arteries (from the internal iliac artery).

The gastrocolic ligament is retracted superiorly, along with the 
transverse colon and transverse mesocolon. The appendix had been 
surgically removed. This dissection is continued in Figure 4.49.
• The root of the mesentery of the small intestine, approximately 
15 to 20 cm in length, extends between the duodenojejunal 
junction and ileocecal junction.
•  The large intestine forms 3½  sides of a square, “framing” 
the jejunum and ileum. On the right are the cecum and as-
cending colon, superior is the transverse colon, on the left 
is the descending and sigmoid colon, and inferiorly is the 
sigmoid colon.
• Chronic in ammation of the colon (ulcerative colitis, Crohn 
disease) is characterized by severe in ammation and ulceration 
of the colon and rectum. In some patients, a colectomy is per-
formed, during which the terminal ileum and colon as well as 
the rectum and anal canal are removed. An ileostomy is then 
constructed to establish an arti cial cutaneous opening between 
the ileum and the skin of the anterolateral abdominal wall.

The jejunal and ileal branches (cut) pass from the left side of the 
superior mesenteric artery. The right colic artery here is a branch 
of the ileocolic artery. This is the same specimen as in Figure 4.48.
• The duodenum is larger in diameter before crossing the superior 
mesenteric vessels and narrow afterward.
• On the right side, there are lymph nodes on the colon, paracolic 
nodes beside the colon, and nodes along the ileocolic artery, 
which drain into nodes anterior to the pancreas.
• The intestines and intestinal vessels lie on a resectable plane 
(remnant of the embryological dorsal mesentery) anterior to 
that of the testicular vessels; these, in turn, lie anterior to the 
plane of the kidney, its vessels, and the ureter.
• The superior hypogastric plexus lie inferior to the bifurcation 
of the aorta and anterior to the left common iliac vein, the body 
of the 5th lumbar vertebra, and the 5th intervertebral disc.

monly made through the right 10th intercostal space in the midax-
illary line. Before the physician takes the biopsy, the person is asked 
to hold his or her breath in full expiration to minimize the costo-
diaphragmatic recess and to lessen the possibility of damaging the 
lung and contaminating the pleural cavity.

HEPATIC SEGMENTATION

 
LIVER AND GALLBLADDER  Abdomen 
345
Each segment is supplied by a secondary or tertiary branch of 
the hepatic artery, bile duct, and portal vein. The hepatic veins 
interdigitate between the portal triads and are intersegmental in 
that they drain adjacent segments. Since the right and left hepatic 
arteries and ducts and branches of the right and left portal veins do 
not communicate, it is possible to perform hepatic lobectomies 
(removal of the right or left part of the liver) and segmentectomies. 
Each segment can be identi ed numerically or by name (Table 4.6).

canaliculi (right). The cut surface of the liver shows the hexagonal 
pattern of the lobules.
• With the exception of lipids, every substance absorbed by the 
alimentary tract is received  rst by the liver via the hepatic portal 
vein. In addition to its many metabolic activities, the liver stores 
glycogen and secretes bile.
•  There is progressive destruction of hepatocytes in cirrhosis of 
the liver and replacement of them by  brous tissue. This tissue 
surrounds the intrahepatic blood vessels and biliary ducts, mak-
ing the liver  rm and impeding circulation of blood through it.

sages (descending to the right). Here, the hepatic artery proper is 
replaced by a left hepatic branch, arising directly from the com-
mon hepatic artery, and a right hepatic branch, arising from the 
superior mesenteric artery (a common variation). A rod traverses 
the omental (epiploic) foramen. The lesser omentum and trans-
verse colon are removed, and the peritoneum is cut along the 
right border of the duodenum; this part of the duodenum is re-
tracted anteriorly. The space opened up reveals two smooth areo-
lar membranes (fusion fascia) normally applied to each other that 
are vestiges of the embryonic peritoneum originally covering these 
surfaces.

moved, and that covering the anterior aspect of the great vessels

A common method for reducing portal hypertension is to di-
vert blood from the portal venous system to the systemic venous 
system by creating a communication between the portal vein and 
the inferior vena cava (IVC). This portacaval anastomosis or por-
tosystemic shunt may be created where these vessels lie close to 
each other posterior to the liver.

duct (F and G). However, when it arises on the left of the bile passages, 
it almost always crosses anterior to the passages (H).

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) is done 
by  rst passing a  beroptic endoscope through the mouth, 
esophagus, and stomach. Then the duodenum is entered, and 
a cannula is inserted into the major duodenal papilla and ad-
vanced under  uoroscopic guidance into the duct of choice 
(bile duct or pancreatic duct) for injection of radiographic con-
trast medium.

studied in Dr. Grant’s laboratory, 7 had accessory ducts. Of these, 
four joined the common hepatic duct near the cystic duct (D), 
two joined the cystic duct (E), and one was an anastomosing duct

• The hepatic portal vein drains venous blood from the gastroin-
testinal tract, spleen, pancreas, and gallbladder to the sinusoids 
of the liver; from here, the blood is conveyed to the systemic 
venous system by the hepatic veins that drain directly to the 
inferior vena cava.
• The hepatic portal vein forms posterior to the neck of the pan-
creas by the union of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins, 
with the inferior mesenteric vein joining at or near the angle 
of union.
• The splenic vein drains blood from the inferior mesenteric, left 
gastro-omental (epiploic), short gastric, and pancreatic veins.
• The right gastro-omental, pancreaticoduodenal, jejunal, ileal, right, 
and middle colic veins drain into the superior mesenteric vein.
• The inferior mesenteric vein commences in the rectal plexus as 
the superior rectal vein and, after crossing the common iliac ves-
sels, becomes the inferior mesenteric vein; branches include the 
sigmoid and left colic veins.
• The hepatic portal vein divides into right and left branches at the 
porta hepatis. The left branch carries mainly, but not exclusively, 
blood from the inferior mesenteric, gastric, and splenic veins, 
and the right branch carries blood mainly from the superior 
mesenteric vein.

A. Portacaval system. In this diagram, portal tributaries (dark blue),

portal hypertension (as in hepatic cirrhosis), the portal blood can-
not pass freely through the liver, and the portocaval anastomoses 
become engorged, dilated, or even varicose; as a consequence, 
these veins may rupture. The sites of the portocaval anastomosis 
shown are between (1) esophageal veins draining into the azygos 
vein (systemic) and left gastric vein (portal), which when dilated 
are esophageal varices; (2) the inferior and middle rectal veins, 
draining into the inferior vena cava (systemic) and the superior 
rectal vein continuing as the inferior mesenteric vein (portal) (hem-
orrhoids result if the vessels are dilated); (3) paraumbilical veins 
(portal) and small epigastric veins of the anterior abdominal wall 
(systemic), which when varicose form “caput medusae” (so named 
because of the resemblance of the radiating veins to the serpents 
on the head of Medusa, a character in Greek mythology); and 
(4) twigs of colic veins (portal) anastomosing with systemic retro-
peritoneal veins. B. Esophageal varices. C. Caput medusae.

• The inferior mesenteric artery arises about 4 cm superior to the aortic bifurcation and crosses 
the left common iliac vessels to become the superior rectal artery.
• The left renal vein drains the left testis, left suprarenal gland, and left kidney; the renal arteries 
are posterior to the renal veins.
• The ureter crosses the external iliac artery just beyond the common iliac bifurcation.
• The testicular vessels cross anterior to the ureter and join the ductus deferens at the deep 
inguinal ring.
• The left renal vein and duodenum (and uncinate process of pancreas—not shown) pass 
between the aorta posteriorly and the superior mesenteric artery anteriorly; they may be com-
pressed like nuts in a nutcracker (B).

Contrast medium was injected into the ureters from a  ex-
ible endoscope (urethroscope) in the bladder. Note the 
papillae bulging into the minor calices, which empty into 
a major calyx that opens, in turn, into the renal pelvis 
drained by the ureter. Sites at which relative constrictions 
in the ureters normally appear: (1) ureteropelvic junction; 
(2) crossing external iliac vessels or pelvic brim; and  (3) as 
ureter traverses bladder wall. These constricted areas are 
potential sites of obstruction by ureteric (kidney) stones. 
C. Arterial supply of the suprarenal glands, kidneys, and 
ureters.
Renal transplantation is now an established operation 
for the treatment of selected cases of chronic renal failure. 
The kidney can be removed from the donor without dam-
aging the suprarenal gland because of the weak septum of 
renal fascia that separates the kidney from this gland. The 
site for transplanting a kidney is in the iliac fossa of the 
greater pelvis. The renal artery and vein are joined to the 
external iliac artery and vein, respectively, and the ureter is 
sutured into the urinary bladder.

A. External features. The superior pole of the kidney is closer to 
the median plane than the inferior pole. Approximately 25% of 
kidneys may have a 2nd, 3rd, and even 4th accessory renal artery 
branching from the aorta. These multiple vessels enter through 
the renal sinus or at the superior or inferior pole (polar arteries). 
B. Renal sinus. The renal sinus is a vertical “pocket” opening on 
the medial side of the kidney. Tucked into the pocket are the renal 
pelvis and renal vessels in a matrix of perinephric fat. C. Renal 
calices. The anterior wall of the renal sinus has been cut away to 
expose the renal pelvis and the calices. D. Internal features. Cysts 
in the kidney, multiple or solitary, are common and usually benign 
 ndings during ultrasound examinations and dissection of cadav-
ers. Adult polycystic disease of the kidneys, however, is an impor-
tant cause of renal failure.

A. Anterior View
The lumbar plexus of nerves is composed of the anterior rami of 
L1–L4 nerves:
• Ilio-inguinal and iliohypogastric nerves (L1) enter the abdomen 
posterior to the medial arcuate ligaments; they run between the 
transversus abdominis and internal oblique to supply the skin of 
the suprapubic and inguinal regions.
• Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh (L2, L3) enters the thigh poste-
rior to the inguinal ligament, just medial to the anterior superior 
iliac spine; it supplies the skin on the anterolateral surface of the 
thigh.
• Femoral nerve (L2–L4) emerges from the lateral border of the 
psoas; innervates the iliacus muscle and the extensor muscles of

• Genitofemoral nerve (L1, L2) pierces the anterior surface of the 
psoas major muscle; divides into femoral and genital branches.
• Obturator nerve (L2–L4) emerges from the medial border of the 
psoas to supply the adductor muscles of the thigh.
• Lumbosacral trunk (L4, L5) passes over the ala of the sacrum to 
join the sacral plexus.

A. Dissection. The clover-shaped central tendon is the aponeurotic 
insertion of the muscle. Diaphragmatic hernia. The diaphragm in 
this specimen fails to arise from the left lateral arcuate ligament, 
leaving a potential opening, the lumbocostal triangle, through 
which abdominal contents may be herniated into the thoracic cav-
ity following a sudden increase in intra-thoracic or intra-abdominal 
pressure. A hiatal hernia is a protrusion of part of the stomach into 
the thorax through the esophageal hiatus.
B. Median arcuate ligament and branches of the aorta. C. Openings 
of the diaphragm. There are three major openings: (1) the caval 
opening for the inferior vena cava, most anterior, at the T8 ver-
tebral level to the right of the midline; (2) the esophageal hiatus, 
intermediate, at T10 level and to the left; and (3) the aortic hiatus, 
which allows the aorta to pass posterior to the vertebral attach-
ment of the diaphragm in the midline at T12.

Rupture of an aortic aneurysm (localized enlargement of the 
abdominal aorta) causes severe pain in the abdomen or back. If 
unrecognized, a ruptured aneurysm has a mortality of nearly 90% 
because of heavy blood loss. Surgeons can repair an aneurysm by 
opening it, inserting a prosthetic graft (such as one made of Da-
cron), and sewing the wall of the aneurysmal aorta over the graft 
to protect it. Aneurysms may also be treated by endovascular cath-
eterization procedures.

A. and B. Sites of visceral referred pain. C. Approximate spi-
nal cord segments and spinal sensory ganglia involved in sym-
pathetic and visceral afferent (pain) innervation of abdominal 
viscera.
Pain is an unpleasant sensation associated with actual or 
potential tissue damage, mediated by speci c nerve  bers to 
the brain, where its conscious appreciation may be modi ed. 
Organic pain arising from an organ such as the stomach varies 
from dull to severe; however, the pain is poorly localized. It radi-
ates to the dermatome level served by the corresponding sen-
sory ganglion, which receives the visceral afferent  bers from 
the organ concerned. Visceral referred pain from a gastric 
ulcer, for example, is referred to the epigastric region because 
the stomach is supplied by pain afferents that reach the T7 and 
T8 spinal (sensory) ganglia and spinal cord segments through 
the greater splanchnic nerve. The brain interprets the pain as 
though the irritation occurred in the skin of the epigastric re-
gion, which is also supplied by the same sensory ganglia and 
spinal cord segments.
Pain arising from the parietal peritoneum is of the somatic 
type and is usually severe. The site of its origin may be localized. 
The anatomical basis for this localization of pain is that the pa-
rietal peritoneum is supplied by somatic sensory  bers through 
thoracic nerves, whereas a viscus such as the appendix is sup-
plied by visceral afferent  bers in the lesser splanchnic nerve. In-
 amed parietal peritoneum is extremely sensitive to stretching. 
When digital pressure is applied to the anterolateral abdominal 
wall over the site of in ammation, the parietal peritoneum is 
stretched. When the  ngers are suddenly removed, extreme lo-
calized pain is usually felt, known as rebound tenderness.

dle part of the ureter usually drain into the common iliac lymph 
nodes, whereas vessels from its inferior part drain into the com-
mon, external, or internal iliac lymph nodes.

third and fourth lumbar veins are removed. In this specimen, the 
greater and lesser splanchnic nerves, the sympathetic trunk, and a 
communicating vein pass through an unusually wide cleft in the 
right crus. The splanchnic nerves convey preganglionic  bers aris-
ing from the cell bodies in the (thoracolumbar) sympathetic trunk. 
The greater splanchnic nerve is from thoracic ganglia 5 to 9, and 
the lesser from thoracic ganglia 10 and 11.

A major advantage of ultrasonography is its ability to produce real-
time images, demonstrating motion of structures and  ow within 
blood vessels. In Doppler ultrasonography (D and E), the shifts in 
frequency between emitted ultrasonic waves and their echoes are 
used to measure the velocities of moving objects. This technique 
is based on the principle of the Doppler effect. Blood  ow through 
vessels is displayed in color, superimposed on the two-dimensional 
cross-sectional image (slow  ow: blue, fast  ow: orange).

SURFACE ANATOMY OF MALE PELVIC GIRDLE
The pelvic girdle (bony pelvis) is a basin-shaped ring of three bones 
(right and left hip bones and sacrum) that connects the vertebral col-
umn to the femora. Palpable features (green) should be symmetri-
cal across the midline. A. The anterior third of the iliac crests are 
subcutaneous and usually easily palpable. The remainder of the crests 
may also be palpable, depending on the thickness of the overlying 
subcutaneous tissue (fat). The inguinal ligament spans between the 
palpable anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and pubic tubercle, lo-
cated superior to the lateral and medial ends of the inguinal fold. 
B. The posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) is usually palpable and 
often lies deep to a visible dimple, indicating the S2 vertebral level. 
The ischial tuberosities may be palpated when the hip joint is  exed.

 
PELVIC GIRDLE  Pelvis and Perineum 
389
SURFACE ANATOMY OF FEMALE PELVIC GIRDLE 
5.2
The female pelvic girdle is relatively wider and shallower than 
that of the male, related to its additional roles of bearing the 
weight of the gravid uterus in late pregnancy and allowing 
passage of the fetus through the pelvic outlet during childbirth 
(parturition). A. Palpable features (green): The hip bones are 
joined anteriorly at the pubic symphysis. The presence of a thick 
overlying pubic fat pad forming the mons pubis may interfere 
with palpation of the pubic tubercles and symphysis. B. Poste-
riorly, the hip bones articulate with the sacrum at the sacro-iliac 
joints.

• On the lateral pelvic wall, the obturator foramen is closed by the 
obturator membrane except for the obturator canal; the obtura-
tor internus muscle attaches to the obturator membrane and sur-
rounding bone and exits the lesser pelvis through the lesser sciatic 
foramen; obturator fascia lies on the medial surface of the muscle.
•  Piriformis lies on the posterolateral pelvic wall and leaves the 
lesser pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen.

attached.
B. Puborectalis.
•  The innermost part of the levator ani/pubococcygeus mus-
cle, the puborectalis, forms a U-shaped muscular “sling” 
around the anorectal junction, which maintains the anorec-
tal (perineal)  exure.

C. External and internal anal sphincters.
• The internal anal sphincter is a thickening of the inner, circular 
muscular coat of the anal canal.
• The external anal sphincter has three often indistinct continu-
ous zones: deep, super cial, and subcutaneous; the deep part 
intermingles with the puborectalis muscle posteriorly.
• The longitudinal muscle layer of the rectum separates the inter-
nal and external anal sphincters and terminates in the subcuta-
neous tissue and skin around the anus.
D. Features of the anal canal.
• The anal columns are 5 to 10 vertical folds of mucosa separated 
by anal sinuses and valves; they contain portions of the rectal 
venous plexus.
•  The pecten is a smooth area of hairless strati ed epithelium that 
lies between the anal valves superiorly and the inferior border of 
the internal anal sphincter inferiorly.
•  The pectinate line is an irregular line at the base of the anal 
valves where the intestinal mucosa is continuous with the 
pecten; this indicates the junction of the superior part of the 
anal canal (derived from embryonic hindgut) and the inferior 
part of the anal canal (derived from the anal pit [proctodeum]). 
Innervation is visceral proximal to the line and somatic distally; 
lymphatic drainage is to the pararectal nodes proximally and to 
the super cial inguinal nodes distally.

DRAINAGE OF RECTUM 
A. Arterial and venous drainage. B. Lymphatic drainage. C. Venous 
and lymphatic drainage superior and inferior to the pectinate line. 
D. Hemorrhoids. Internal hemorrhoids (piles) are prolapses of 
rectal mucosa containing the normally dilated veins of the internal 
rectal venous plexus. Internal hemorrhoids are thought to result 
from a breakdown of the muscularis mucosae, a smooth muscle 
layer deep to the mucosa. Internal hemorrhoids that prolapse 
through the anal canal are often compressed by the contracted 
sphincters, impeding blood  ow. As a result, they tend to stran-
gulate and ulcerate. Because of the presence of abundant arte-
riovenous anastomoses, bleeding from internal hemorrhoids is 
characteristically bright red. The current practice is to treat only 
prolapsed, ulcerated internal hemorrhoids.
External hemorrhoids are thromboses (blood clots) in the 
veins of the external rectal venous plexus and are covered by 
skin. Predisposing factors for hemorrhoids include pregnancy, 
chronic constipation, and any disorder that impedes venous re-
turn including increased intra-abdominal pressure. The superior 
rectal vein drains into the inferior mesenteric vein, whereas the 
middle and inferior rectal veins drain through the systemic sys-
tem into the inferior vena cava. Any abnormal increase in pres-
sure in the valveless portal system or veins of the trunk may cause 
enlargement of the superior rectal veins, resulting in an increase 
in blood  ow or stasis in the internal rectal venous plexus. In 
portal hypertension that occurs in relation to hepatic cirrho-
sis, the portacaval anastomosis (e.g., esophageal) may become 
varicose and rupture. Note that the veins of the rectal plexuses 
normally appear varicose (dilated and tortuous), even in new-
borns, and that internal hemorrhoids occur most commonly in 
the absence of portal hypertension.
Regarding pain from and the treatment of hemorrhoids, 
note that the anal canal superior to the pectinate line is visceral; 
thus, it is innervated by visceral afferent pain  bers, so that an 
incision or needle insertion into this region is painless. Internal 
hemorrhoids are not painful and can be treated without anes-
thesia. Inferior to the pectinate line, the anal canal is somatic, 
supplied by the inferior anal (rectal) nerves containing somatic 
sensory  bers. Therefore, it is sensitive to painful stimuli (e.g., 
to the prick of a hypodermic needle). External hemorrhoids can 
be painful but often resolve in a few days.

RECTUM IN SITU 
5.20
•  The sigmoid colon begins at the left pelvic brim and becomes 
the rectum anterior to the third sacral segment in the midline.
•  The superior hypogastric plexus lies inferior to the bifurcation of 
the aorta and anterior to the left common iliac vein.
•  The ureter adheres to the external aspect of the peritoneum, 
crosses the external iliac vessels, and descends anterior to the 
internal iliac artery. The ductus deferens and its artery also ad-
here to the peritoneum, cross the external iliac vessels, and then 
hook around the inferior epigastric artery to join the other com-
ponents of the spermatic cord.
•  The genitofemoral nerve lies on the psoas.

anterior pelvis (plane of urinary bladder and prostate) 
demonstrating pelvic fascia.
• The inferior epigastric artery and accompanying 
veins enter the rectus sheath, covered posteriorly 
with peritoneum to form the lateral umbilical fold. 
The medial umbilical fold is formed by peritoneum 
overlying the medial umbilical ligament (obliterated 
umbilical artery), and the median umbilical fold is 
formed by the median umbilical ligament (urachus).
• The pelvic genito-urinary organs are subperitoneal. 
Near the bladder, the ureter accompanies a “leash” 
of internal iliac vessels and derivatives within the 
hypogastric sheath, a  bro-areolar structure.

A. Dissection. The ejaculatory duct ( 2 cm in length) is formed by 
the union of the ductus deferens and duct of the seminal gland; 
it passes anteriorly and inferiorly through the substance of the 
prostate to enter the prostatic urethra. B. Overview of urogenital 
system, schematic illustration. The common method of sterilizing 
males is a deferentectomy, popularly called  vasectomy. During 
this procedure, part of the ductus deferens is ligated and/or excised 
through an incision in the superior part of the scrotum. Hence, the 
subsequent ejaculated  uid contains no sperms.

• The mucous membrane is smooth over the trigone of the urinary 
bladder (triangular region demarcated by ureteric and internal 
urethral ori ces) but folded elsewhere, especially when the blad-
der is empty.
• The opening of the vestigial prostatic utricle is in the seminal col-
liculus on the urethral crest; there is an ori ce of an ejaculatory 
duct on each side of the prostatic utricle. The prostatic fascia 
encloses the prostatic venous plexus.
The prostate is of considerable medical interest because enlarge-
ment or benign hypertrophy of the prostate (BHP) is common 
after middle age, affecting virtually every male who lives long 
enough. An enlarged prostate projects into the urinary bladder 
and impedes urination by distorting the prostatic urethra. The 
middle lobule usually enlarges the most and obstructs the internal 
urethral ori ce. The more the person strains, the more the valvelike 
prostatic mass occludes the urethra.
BHP is a common cause of urethral obstruction, leading to 
nocturia (needing to void during the night), dysuria (dif culty 
and/or pain during urination), and urgency (sudden desire to 
void). BHP also increases the risk of bladder infections (cystitis) as 
well as kidney damage.

Site of transducer in rectum
Concretions surrounding distended and collapsed urethra
Calcification in seminal colliculus
A. Longitudinal scan. B. Transverse scan. The probe was inserted 
into the rectum to scan the anteriorly located prostate. The ducts 
of the glands in the peripheral zone open into the prostatic sinuses, 
whereas the ducts of the glands in the central (internal) zone open 
into the prostatic sinuses and onto the seminal colliculus.
Because of the close relationship of the prostate to the prostatic 
urethra, obstructions of the urethra may be relieved endoscopically. 
The instrument is inserted transurethrally through the external 
urethral ori ce and spongy urethra into the prostatic urethra. All or 
part of the prostate, or just the hypertrophied part, is removed by 
transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). In more seri-
ous cases, the entire prostate is removed along with the seminal 
glands, ejaculatory ducts, and terminal parts of the deferent ducts 
(radical prostatectomy).
TURP and improved operative techniques (laparoscopic or ro-
botic surgery) attempt to preserve the nerves and blood vessels 
associated with the capsule of the prostate and adjacent to the 
seminal vesicles as they pass to and from the penis, increasing the 
possibility for patients to retain sexual function after surgery as well 
as restoring normal urinary control.

• The primary function of the sacral sympathetic trunks is to pro-
vide postsynaptic  bers to the sacral plexus for sympathetic in-
nervation of the lower limb.
• The peri-arterial plexuses of the ovarian, superior rectal, and in-
ternal iliac arteries are minor routes by which sympathetic  bers 
enter the pelvis. Their primary function is vasomotion of the ar-
teries they accompany.
• The hypogastric plexuses (superior and inferior) are networks of 
sympathetic and visceral afferent nerve  bers.
•  The superior hypogastric plexus carries  bers conveyed to 
and from the aortic (intermesenteric) plexus by the L3 and 
L4 splanchnic nerves. The superior hypogastric plexus divides 
into right and left hypogastric nerves that merge with the para-
sympathetic pelvic splanchnic nerves to form the inferior hypo-
gastric plexuses.
•  The  bers of the inferior hypogastric plexuses continue to the 
pelvic viscera on which they form pelvic plexuses (e.g., prostatic 
nerve plexus).
•  The pelvic splanchnic nerves convey presynaptic parasympa-
thetic  bers from the S2–S4 spinal cord segments, which make 
up the sacral out ow of the parasympathetic system.
•  Visceral afferents conveying unconscious re ex sensation follow 
the course of the parasympathetic  bers retrogradely to the spi-
nal sensory ganglia of S2–S4, as do those transmitting pain sen-
sations from the viscera inferior to the pelvic pain line (structures 
that do not contact the peritoneum plus the distal sigmoid 
colon and rectum). Visceral afferent  bers conducting pain from 
structures superior to the pelvic pain line (structures in contact 
with the peritoneum, except for the distal sigmoid colon and 
rectum) follow the sympathetic  bers retrogradely to inferior 
thoracic and superior lumbar spinal ganglia.

UTERUS AND BROAD LIGAMENT
A. and B. Two paramedian sections show “mesenteries” with 
the pre x meso-. “Salpinx” is the Greek word for trumpet or 
tube, and “metro” for uterus. The mesentery of the uterus and 
uterine tube is called the broad ligament. The major part of the 
broad ligament, the mesometrium, is attached to the uterus. The 
ovary is attached to the broad ligament by a mesentery of its 
own, called the mesovarium, to the uterus by the ligament of the 
ovary, and near the pelvic brim, by the suspensory ligament of 
the ovary containing the ovarian vessels. The part of the broad 
ligament superior to the level of the mesovarium is called the 
mesosalpinx. C. Hysterectomy (excision of the uterus) is per-
formed through the lower anterior abdominal wall or through 
the vagina. Because the uterine artery crosses superior to the 
ureter near the lateral fornix of the vagina, the ureter is in dan-
ger of being inadvertently clamped or severed when the uterine 
artery is tied off during a hysterectomy.

through external os of the uterus. If normal, contrast medium 
travels through the triangular uterine cavity (UC) and uterine 
tubes (arrowheads) and passes into the pararectal fossae (P) of the 
peritoneal cavity. The female genital tract is in direct communica-
tion with the peritoneal cavity and is, therefore, a potential path-
way for the spread of an infection from the vagina and uterus.

PREGNANT UTERUS
A. Median section; fetus is intact. B. Monthly changes in size 
of uterus during pregnancy. Over the 9 months of pregnancy, 
the gravid uterus expands greatly to accommodate the fetus, 
becoming larger and increasingly thin walled. At the end of 
pregnancy, the fetus “drops,” as the head becomes engaged 
in the lesser pelvis. The uterus becomes nearly membranous, 
with the fundus dropping below its highest level (achieved in 
the 9th month), at which time it extends superiorly to the costal 
margin, occupying most of the abdominopelvic cavity.

URETER AND RELATIONSHIP TO UTERINE ARTERY
• Most of the pubic symphysis and most of the bladder (except 
the trigone) have been removed.
• The left ureter is crossed by the ovarian vessels and nerves; the 
apex of the inverted V-shaped root of the sigmoid mesocolon is 
situated anterior to the left ureter.
• The left ureter crosses the external iliac artery at the bifurcation of 
the common iliac artery and then descends anterior to the inter-
nal iliac artery; its course is subperitoneal from where it enters the 
pelvis to where it passes deep to the broad ligament and is crossed 
by the uterine artery. Injury of the ureter may occur in this region 
when the uterine artery is ligated and cut during hysterectomy.

• Pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2–S4) supply parasym-
pathetic motor  bers to the uterus and vagina 
(and vasodilator  bers to the erectile tissue of the 
clitoris and bulb of the vestibule; not shown).
• Presynaptic sympathetic  bers pass through the 
lumbar splanchnic nerves to synapse in prevertebral 
ganglia; the postsynaptic  bers travel through the 
superior and inferior hypogastric plexuses to reach 
the pelvic viscera.
• Visceral afferent  bers conducting pain from intra-
peritoneal viscera travel with the sympathetic  -
bers to the T12–L2 spinal ganglia. Visceral afferent 
 bers conducting pain from subperitoneal viscera 
travel with parasympathetic  bers to the S2–S4 
spinal ganglia.
• Somatic sensation from the opening of the vagina 
also passes to the S2–S4 spinal ganglia via the 
pudendal nerve.
• Muscular contractions of the uterus are hormonally 
induced.

INNERVATION OF PELVIC VISCERA—OBSTETRICAL NERVE BLOCKS 
5.41
• A spinal block, in which the anesthetic agent is introduced with 
a needle into the spinal subarachnoid space at the L3–L4 ver-
tebral level, produces complete anesthesia inferior to approxi-
mately the waist level. The perineum, pelvic  oor, and birth 
canal are anesthetized, and motor and sensory functions of the 
entire lower limbs, as well as sensation of uterine contractions, 
are temporarily eliminated.
• With the caudal epidural block, the anesthetic agent is adminis-
tered using an in-dwelling catheter in the sacral canal. The entire 
birth canal, pelvic  oor, and most of the perineum are anesthe-
tized, but the lower limbs are not usually affected. The mother is 
aware of her uterine contractions.
•  A pudendal nerve block is a peripheral nerve block that pro-
vides local anesthesia over the S2–S4 dermatomes (most of 
the perineum) and the inferior quarter of the vagina. It does 
not block pain from the superior birth canal (uterine cervix 
and superior vagina), so the mother is able to feel uterine 
contractions.

MECHANISM OF CERVIX AND UPPER VAGINA
A. Greater and lesser pelvis demonstrating pelvic viscera and 
endopelvic fascia. B. Schematic illustration of fascial ligaments 
and areolar spaces at the level of tendinous arch of pelvic fascia.
• Note the parietal pelvic fascia covering the obturator inter-
nus and levator ani muscles and the visceral pelvic fasciae 
are continuous where the organs penetrate the pelvic  oor, 
forming a tendinous arch of pelvic fascia bilaterally.
• The endopelvic fascia lies between, and is continuous 
with, both visceral and parietal layers of pelvic fascia. The 
loose, areolar portions of the endopelvic fascia have been 
removed; the  brous, condensed portions remain. Note 
the condensation of this fascia into the hypogastric sheath, 
containing the vessels to the pelvic viscera, the ureters, and 
(in the male) the ductus deferens.
• Observe the ligamentous extensions of the hypogastric 
sheath: the lateral ligament of the urinary bladder, the 
transverse cervical ligament at the base of the broad liga-
ment, and a less prominent lamina posteriorly containing 
the middle rectal vessels.

DISSECTION OF MALE PERINEUM I 
5.50
Super cial dissection.
• The membranous layer of subcutaneous tissue of the perineum 
was incised and re ected, opening the subcutaneous perineal 
compartment (pouch) in which the cutaneous nerves course.
• The perineal membrane is exposed between the three paired mus-
cles of the super cial compartment; although not evident here, 
the muscles are individually ensheathed with investing fascia.
• The anal canal is surrounded by the external anal sphincter. The 
super cial  bers of the sphincter anchor the anal canal anteriorly 
to the perineal body and posteriorly, via the anococcygeal body 
(ligament), to the coccyx and skin of the gluteal cleft.
•  Ischio-anal (ischiorectal) fossae, from which fat bodies have 
been removed, lie on each side of the external anal sphincter. 
The fossae are also bound medially and superiorly by the levator 
ani, laterally by the ischial tuberosities and obturator internus 
fascia, and posteriorly by the gluteus maximus overlying the 
sacrotuberous ligaments. An anterior recess of each ischio-anal 
fossa extends superior to the perineal membrane.
•  In the lateral wall of the fossa, the inferior anal (rectal) nerve 
emerges from the pudendal canal and, with the perineal branch 
of S4, supplies the voluntary external anal sphincter and peri-
anal skin; most cutaneous twigs have been removed.

DISSECTION OF THE MALE PERINEUM II
A. The super cial perineal muscles have been removed, reveal-
ing the roots of the erectile bodies (crura and bulb) of the penis, 
attached to the ischiopubic rami and perineal membrane. On 
the left side, the super cial and deep parts of the external anal 
sphincter were incised and re ected; the underlying muscu-
lo brous continuation of the outer longitudinal layer of the 
muscular layer of the rectum is cut to reveal thickening of the 
inner circular layer that comprises the internal anal sphincter. 
B.  Rupture of the spongy urethra in the bulb of the penis 
results in extravasation (abnormal passage) of urine into the 
subcutaneous perineal compartment. The attachments of the 
membranous layer of subcutaneous tissue determine the direc-
tion and restrictions of  ow of the extravasated urine. Urine and 
blood may pass deep to the continuations of the membranous 
layer in the scrotum, penis, and inferior abdominal wall. The 
urine cannot pass laterally and inferiorly into the thighs because 
the membranous layer fuses with the fascia lata (deep fascia of 
the thigh) nor posteriorly into the anal triangle due to continu-
ity with the perineal membrane and perineal body.

tion over the glans. In some males, it is tight and cannot be 
retracted easily (phimosis), if at all. Secretions (smegma) may 
accumulate in the preputial sac, located between the glans 
penis and prepuce, causing irritation. Circumcision exposes 
most, or all, of the glans.

A. Super cial dissection.
On the right side of the specimen:
• A long digital process of fat lies deep to the fatty subcutane-
ous tissue and descends into the labium majus.
• The round ligament of the uterus ends as a branching band of 
fascia that spreads out super cial to the fatty digital process.
On the left side of the specimen:
• Most of the fatty digital process is removed.
• The mons pubis is the rounded fatty prominence anterior to 
the pubic symphysis and bodies of the pubic bones.
• The posterior labial vessels and nerves (S2, S3) are joined by 
the perineal branch of the posterior cutaneous nerve of thigh 
(S1, S2, S3) and run anterior to the mons pubis. At the mons 
pubis, the vessels anastomose with the external pudendal 
vessels, and the nerves overlap in supply with the ilio-inguinal 
nerve (L1).

A. Dissection of perineal nerves. The anterior aspect of the 
perineum is supplied by anterior labial nerves, derived from 
the ilio-inguinal nerve and genital branch of the genitofemoral 
nerve. The pudendal nerve is the main nerve of the perineum. 
 Posterior labial nerves, derived from the super cial perineal 
nerve, supply most of the vulva. The deep perineal nerve sup-
plies the ori ce of the vagina and super cial perineal muscles; 
and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris supplies deep perineal mus-
cles and sensations to the clitoris. The inferior anal (rectal) nerve, 
also from the pudendal nerve, innervates the external anal 
sphincter and the peri-anal skin. The lateral perineum is sup-
plied by the perineal branch of the posterior cutaneous nerve 
of the thigh. B. To relieve the pain experienced during child-
birth, pudendal nerve block anesthesia may be performed by 
 injecting a local anesthetic agent into the tissue surrounding the 
pudendal nerve, near the ischial spine. A pudendal nerve block 
does not abolish sensations from the anterior and lateral parts 
of the perineum. Therefore, an anesthetic block of the ilio-
inguinal and/ or perineal branch of the posterior cutaneous 
nerve of the thigh may also need to be performed.

• Note the thickness of the subcutaneous fatty tissue of the mons 
pubis and the encapsulated digital process of fat deep to this. The 
suspensory ligament of the clitoris descends from the linea alba.
• Anteriorly, each labium minus forms two laminae or folds: The 
lateral laminae of the labia pass on each side of the glans clito-
ris and unite, forming a hood that partially or completely cov-
ers the glans, the prepuce (foreskin) of the clitoris. The medial 
laminae of the labia merge posterior to the glans, forming the 
frenulum of the clitoris.
•  There are three muscles on each side: bulbospongiosus, ischio-
cavernosus, and super cial transverse perineal; the perineal 
membrane is visible between them.
•  The bulbospongiosus muscle overlies the bulb of the vestibule 
and the great vestibular gland. In the male, the muscles of the 
two sides are united by a median raphe; in the female, the ori ce 
of the vagina separates the right from the left.

In A:
• The bulbospongiosus muscle is re ected on the right side and 
mostly removed on the left side; the posterior portion of the 
bulb of the vestibule and the greater vestibular gland have been 
removed on the left side.
• The glans and body of the clitoris is displaced to the right so that 
the distribution of the dorsal vessels and nerve of the clitoris can 
be seen.
• Homologues of the bulb of the penis, the bulbs of the vestibule 
exist as two masses of elongated erectile tissue that lie along the 
sides of the vaginal ori ce; veins connect the bulbs of the vesti-
bule to the glans of the clitoris.
•  On the specimen’s right side, the greater vestibular gland is 
situated at the posterior end of the bulb; both structures are 
covered by bulbospongiosus muscle.
•  On the specimen’s left side, the bulb, gland, and perineal mem-

vaginal wall.
In B:
•  The body of the clitoris, composed of two crura (corpora caver-

sphincter of the female, rests on the urethra and straddles 
the vagina.
• The labia minora (cut short here) bound the vestibule of the 
vagina.
A. and B. The osseoligamentous boundaries of the diamond-
shaped perineum are the pubic symphysis, ischiopubic rami, 
ischial tuberosities, sacrotuberous ligaments, and coccyx. For 
descriptive purposes, a transverse line connecting the ischial 
tuberosities subdivides the diamond into urogenital and anal 
triangles.

This is a different dissection than the previous series, with the vulva 
undissected centrally but the perineum dissected deeply on each 
side. Although most of the perineal membrane and bulbs of the 
vestibule have been removed, the greater vestibular glands (struc-
tures of the super cial perineal compartment) have been left in 
place. The development and extent of the smooth muscle layer 
corresponding in position to the voluntary deep transverse peri-
neal muscles of the male are highly variable, being relatively ex-
tensive in this case, blending centrally with voluntary  bers of the 
external urethral sphincter and the perineal body.
The greater vestibular glands are usually not palpable but are 
so when infected. Occlusion of the vestibular gland duct can 
predispose the individual to infection of the vestibular gland. 
The gland is the site or origin of most vulvar adenocarcinomas 
(cancers). Bartholinitis, in ammation of the greater vestibular 
(Bartholin) glands, may result from a number of pathogenic or-
ganisms. Infected glands may enlarge to a diameter of 4 to 5 cm 
and impinge on the wall of the rectum. Occlusion of the vestibu-
lar gland duct without infection can result in the accumulation of 
mucin (Bartholin cyst).

Lower Limb  
SYSTEMIC OVERVIEW OF LOWER LIMB: BONES
A. and C. Anteroposterior radiographs of normal postmortem 
specimens of newborns show the bony (white) and cartilagi-
nous (gray) components of the femur and hip bone. B. Ossi ed 
portions of bones of lower limb at birth. The hip bone can be 
divided into three primary parts: ilium, ischium, and pubis. The 
diaphyses (bodies) of the long bones are well ossi ed. Some 
epiphyses (growth plates) and tarsal bones have begun to os-
sify. D. Foot of child age 4.
Dislocated epiphysis of femoral head. In older children 
and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age), the epiphysis of the 
femoral head may slip away from the femoral neck because of 
weakness of the epiphyseal plate. This injury may be caused by 
acute trauma or repetitive microtraumas that place increased 
shearing stress on the epiphysis, especially with abduction and 
lateral rotation.
Fractures involving epiphyseal plates. The primary ossi ca-
tion center for the superior end of the tibia appears shortly after 
birth and joins the shaft of the tibia during adolescence (usu-
ally 16 to 18 years of age). Tibial fractures in children are more 
serious if they involve the epiphyseal plates because continued 
normal growth of bone may be jeopardized. Disruption of the 
epiphyseal plate at the tibial tuberosity may cause in ammation 
of the tuberosity and chronic recurring pain during adolescence 
(Osgood-Schlatter disease), especially in young athletes.

the relative amount of solid matter and by the number and size of 
the spaces they contain. All bones have a super cial thin layer of 
compact bone around a central mass of spongy bone, except where 
the latter is replaced by the medullary (marrow) cavity. Within the 
medullary cavity of adult bones and between the spicules (trabecu-
lae) of spongy bone, yellow (fatty) or red (blood cell and platelet-
forming) bone marrow or both are found. This is signi cant for MRIs 
where the compact bone is seen as a thin black line surrounding the 
whiter spongy bone with its abundant fatty marrow.

Lower Limb  
SYSTEMIC OVERVIEW OF LOWER LIMB: NERVES
A. Myotomes. Somatic motor (general somatic efferent)  bers trans-
mit impulses to skeletal (voluntary) muscles. The unilateral muscle 
mass receiving innervation from the somatic motor  bers conveyed 
by a single spinal nerve is a myotome. Each skeletal muscle is usu-
ally innervated by the somatic motor  bers of several spinal nerves; 
therefore, the muscle myotome will consist of several segments. 
The muscle myotomes have been grouped by joint movement to 
facilitate clinical testing. B. Myotatic (deep tendon) re exes. A myo-
tatic (stretch) re ex is an involuntary contraction of a muscle in re-
sponse to being stretched. Deep tendon re exes (e.g., “knee jerk”) 
are monosynaptic stretch re exes that are elicited by briskly tapping 
the tendon with a re ex hammer. Each tendon re ex is mediated 
by speci c spinal nerves. Stretch re exes control muscle tone (e.g., 
in antigravity, muscles that keep the body upright against gravity).

The dermatomal, or segmental, pattern of distribution of sensory 
nerve  bers persists despite the merging of spinal nerves in plexus 
formation during development. Two different dermatome maps are 
commonly used. A. and B. The dermatome pattern of the lower 
limb according to Foerster (1933) is preferred by many because of its 
correlation with clinical  ndings. C. and D. The dermatome pattern 
of the lower limb according to Keegan and Garrett (1948) is pre-
ferred by others for its aesthetic uniformity and obvious correlation 
with development. Although depicted as distinct zones, adjacent der-
matomes overlap considerably, except along the axial line.

The arteries often anastomose or communicate to form networks 
to ensure blood supply distal to the joint throughout the range 
of movement (cruciate, geniculate and tarsal anastomoses). 
If a main channel is slowly occluded, the smaller alternate channels 
can usually increase in size, providing a collateral circulation that 
ensures the blood supply to structures distal to the blockage.

Sites where perforating
veins penetrate deep fascia
Highly anastomotic veins, largely unaccompanied by arteries, 
are abundant in the subcutaneous tissue, draining deeply via 
multiple perforating veins. 
Vein grafts obtained by surgically harvesting parts of the 
great saphenous vein are used to bypass obstructions in blood 
vessels (e.g., a coronary artery). When used as a bypass, the 
vein is reversed so that the valves do not obstruct blood  ow. 
Because there are so many anastomosing leg veins, removal of 
the great saphenous vein rarely affects circulation seriously, pro-
vided the deep veins are intact.
Saphenous cut down. The great saphenous vein can be lo-
cated by making a skin incision anterior to the medial malleolus. 
This procedure is used to insert a cannula for prolonged admin-
istration of blood, electrolytes, drugs, etc.

shunted from the super cial veins (e.g., great saphenous vein) to 
the deep veins (e.g.,  bular and posterior tibial veins) via perforating 
veins that penetrate the deep fascia. Muscular compression of deep 
veins assists return of blood to the heart against gravity. B. Varicose 
veins form when either the deep fascia or the valves of the perfo-
rating veins are incompetent. This allows the muscular compression 
that normally propels blood toward the heart to push blood from the 
deep to the super cial veins. Consequently, super cial veins become 
enlarged and tortuous. C. Normal veins distended following exercise.

The super cial lymphatic vessels accompany the saphenous veins 
and their tributaries in the super cial fascia. The lymphatic vessels 
along the great saphenous vein drain into the super cial inguinal 
lymph nodes; those along the small saphenous vein drain into the 
popliteal lymph nodes. Lymph from the super cial inguinal nodes 
drains to the deep inguinal and external iliac nodes. Lymph from 
the popliteal nodes ascends through deep lymphatic vessels ac-
companying the deep blood vessels to the deep inguinal nodes. 
Note that the great saphenous vein lies anterior to the medial 
malleolus and a hand’s breadth posterior to the medial border 
of the patella. Lymph nodes enlarge when diseased. Abrasions 
and minor sepsis, caused by pathogenic micro-organisms or their 
toxins, may produce slight enlargement of the super cial inguinal 
nodes (lymphadenopathy) in otherwise healthy people. Malig-
nancies (e.g., of the external genitalia and uterus) and perineal 
abscesses also result in enlargement of these nodes.

A. Anterior skin and subcutaneous tissue have been removed to re-
veal the deep fascia of the thigh (fascia lata) and leg (crural fascia). 
B. Lateral skin and subcutaneous tissue have been removed to re-
veal the fascia lata. The fascia lata is thick laterally and forms the 
iliotibial tract. The iliotibial tract serves as a common aponeurosis 
for the gluteus maximus and tensor fasciae latae muscles. One of 
the most common causes of lateral knee pain in endurance athletes 
(e.g., runners, cyclers, hikers) is iliotibial tract (band) syndrome 
(ITBS). Friction of the IT tract against the lateral epicondyle of the 
femur with  exion and extension of the knee (e.g., during run-
ning) may result in the in ammation of the IT tract over the lateral 
aspect of the knee or its attachment to the dorsolateral tubercle 
(Gerdy tubercle). ITBS may also occur in the hip region, especially 
in older individuals.

C. and D. The fascial compartments of the thigh (C) and leg (D) are 
demonstrated in transverse section. The fascial compartments contain 
muscles that generally perform common functions and share common 
innervation and contain the spread of infection. While both thigh and 
leg have anterior and posterior compartments, the thigh also includes 
a medial compartment and the leg a lateral compartment. Trauma 
to muscles and/or vessels in the compartments may produce hemor-
rhage, edema, and in ammation of the muscles. Because the septa, 
deep fascia, and bony attachments  rmly bound the compartments, 
increased volume resulting from these processes raises intracompart-
mental pressure. In compartment syndromes, structures within or 
distal to the compressed area become ischemic and may become 
permanently injured (e.g., compression of capillary beds results in de-
nervation and consequent paralysis of muscles). A fasciotomy (inci-
sion of bounding fascia or septum) may be performed to relieve the 
pressure in the compartment and restore circulation.

Patellar tendinitis (jumper’s knee) is caused by continuous over-

the tendon. The most vulnerable site is where the patellar ligament 
(tendon) attaches to the patella. This overuse injury can result in 
degeneration and tearing of the tendon.

A “hip pointer,” which is a contusion of the iliac crest, usually 
occurs at its anterior part (e.g., where the sartorius attaches to 
the anterior superior iliac spine). This is one of the most common 
injuries to the hip region, usually occurring in association with col-
lision sports. Contusions cause bleeding from ruptured capillaries 
and in ltration of blood into the muscles, tendons, and other soft 
tissues. The term hip pointer may also refer to avulsion of bony 
muscle attachments, for example, of the sartorius or rectus femoris 
from the anterior superior or inferior iliac spines or of the iliopsoas 
from the lesser trochanter of the femur. However, these injuries 
should be called avulsion fractures.
A person with a paralyzed quadriceps cannot extend the 
leg against resistance and usually presses on the distal end of 
the thigh during walking to prevent inadvertent  exion of the 
knee joint.

bNumbers indicate spinal cord segmental innervation of nerves (e.g., L1, L2, and L3 indicate that nerves supplying psoas major are derived from  rst three lumbar segments of the spinal cord; boldface type 
[e.g., L1, L2] indicates main segmental innervation). Damage to one or more of these spinal cord segments or to motor nerve roots arising from these segments results in paralysis of the muscles concerned.
c Psoas major is also a postural muscle that helps control deviation of trunk and is active during standing.
dFour actions of sartorius (L. sartor, tailor) produce the once-common cross-legged sitting position used by tailors—hence the name.

from lumbar segments of the spinal cord; boldface type [L3] indicates main segmental innervation). Damage to one or more of these spinal cord segments or to motor nerve roots arising from these segments 
results in paralysis of the muscles concerned.

A. Dissection. B. Muscular tripod. The sartorius, gracilis, and 
semitendinosus muscles form an inverted tripod arising from 
three different components of the hip bone. These muscles 
course within three different compartments, perform three dif-
ferent functions, and are innervated by three different nerves 
yet share a common distal attachment. C. Distal attachment of 
sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles. All three tendons 
become thin and aponeurotic and are collectively referred to as 
the pes anserinus.
The gracilis is a relatively weak member of the adductor group 
and hence can be removed without noticeable loss of its actions on 
the leg. Surgeons often transplant the gracilis, or part of it, with 
its nerve and blood vessels to replace a damaged muscle, in the 
hand, for example.

nus has two parts: one belongs to the adductor group, innervated 
by the obturator nerve and the other to the hamstring group, 
innervated by the tibial portion of the sciatic nerve. The trochan-
teric bursa separates the superior  bers of the gluteus maximus 
from the greater trochanter of the femur, and the ischial bursa 
separates the inferior part of the gluteus maximus from the ischial 
tuberosity.
Diffuse deep pain in the lateral thigh region (e.g., during stair climb-
ing) may be caused by trochanteric bursitis. It is characterized by 
point tenderness over the greater trochanter, with pain radiating along 
the iliotibial tract. Ischial bursitis results from excessive friction be-
tween the ischial bursae and ischial tuberosities (e.g., as from cycling).

the middle part is excised; two cubes remain to identify its nerve. The gluteus 
maximus is the only muscle to cover the greater trochanter; it is aponeurotic and 
has underlying bursae where it glides on the trochanter (trochanteric bursa) and 
the aponeurosis of the vastus lateralis muscle (gluteofemoral bursa). B. Intraglu-
teal injection. Injections can be made safely only into the superolateral part of 
the buttock to avoid injury to the sciatic and gluteal nerves. This site has a rich 
vascular network from the superior gluteal vessels that lie between the gluteus

A. The proximal three quarters of the gluteus maximus muscle is re ected, and 
parts of the gluteus medius and the three hamstring muscles are excised. The 
superior gluteal vessels and nerves emerge superior to the piriformis muscle; all 
other vessels and nerves emerge inferior to it. B. When the weight is borne by 
one limb, the muscles on the supported side  x the pelvis so that it does not sag 
to the unsupported side, keeping the pelvis level. C. When the right abductors 
are paralyzed, owing to a lesion of the right superior gluteal nerve,  xation by 
these muscles is lost and the pelvis tilts to the unsupported left side (positive 
Trendelenburg sign).

A. Piriformis and quadratus femoris. B. Relationship of sciatic nerve 
to piriformis muscle. Of 640 limbs studied in Dr. Grant’s laboratory, 
in 87%, the tibial and  bular (peroneal) divisions passed inferior to 
the piriformis (left); in 12.2%, the  bular (peroneal) division passed 
through the piriformis (center); and in 0.5%, the  bular (peroneal) 
division passed superior to the piriformis (right).
Sciatic nerve block. Sensation conveyed by the sciatic nerve can 
be blocked by injecting an anesthetic agent a few centimeters inferior 
to the midpoint of the line joining the PSIS and the superior border 
of the greater trochanter. Paresthesia radiates to the foot because of 
anesthesia of the plantar nerves, which are terminal branches of the 
tibial nerve derived from the sciatic nerve.

• The obturator internus is located partly in the pelvis, where it covers most 
of the lateral wall of the lesser pelvis. It leaves the pelvis through the lesser 
sciatic foramen, makes a right-angle turn, becomes tendinous, and re-
ceives the distal attachments of the gemelli before attaching to the medial 
surface of the greater trochanter (trochanteric fossa).
• The obturator externus extends from the external surface of the obturator 
membrane and surrounding bone of the pelvis to the posterior aspect of 
the greater trochanter, passing directly under the acetabulum and neck of 
the femur.
• Common  bular nerve compression at piriformis. In the approximately 
12% of people in whom the common  bular division of the sciatic nerve 
passes through the piriformis, this muscle may compress the nerve.

A. Iliofemoral ligament. The head of the femur is exposed just me-
dial to the iliofemoral ligament and faces superiorly, medially, and 
anteriorly. At the site of the subtendinous bursa of psoas, the capsule 
is weak or (as in this specimen) partially de cient, but it is guarded 
by the psoas tendon. The iliofemoral ligament is shaped like an 
inverted “Y.” Superiorly it is attached deep to the rectus femoris 
muscle; the ligament becomes tight on medial rotation of the femur.

the large subtendinous bursa of the obturator internus at the lesser 
sciatic notch, where the tendon turns 90 degrees to attach to the 
greater trochanter. D. Muscle attachments onto the posterior aspect

Osteoarthritis of the hip joint, characterized by pain, edema, 
limitation of motion, and erosion of articular cartilage, is a common 
cause of disability. During hip replacement, a metal prosthesis an-
chored to the person’s femur by bone cement replaces the femoral 
head and neck. A plastic socket cemented to the hip bone replaces 
the acetabulum.

• The ligament of the head of the femur lies between the head 
of the femur and the acetabulum. These  bers are attached 
superiorly to the pit (fovea) on the head of the femur and 
inferiorly to the transverse acetabular ligament and the mar-
gins of the acetabular notch. The artery of the ligament of the

chondrosis. One or more primary centers of ossi cation appear in 
the triradiate cartilage at approximately the 12th year. Secondary 
centers of ossi cation appear along the length of the iliac crest, at 
the anterior inferior iliac spine, the ischial tuberosity, and the pubic 
symphysis at about puberty; fusion is usually complete by age 23.

Fractures of the femoral neck often disrupt the blood supply 
to the head of the femur. The medial circum ex femoral artery 
supplies most of the blood to the head and neck of the femur and 
is often torn when the femoral neck is fractured. In some cases, the 
blood supplied by the artery of the ligament of the head may be 
the only blood received by the proximal fragment of the femoral 
head, which may be inadequate. If the blood vessels are ruptured, 
the fragment of bone may receive no blood and undergo aseptic 
avascular necrosis.

Because the popliteal artery is deep in the popliteal fossa, it may 
be dif cult to feel the popliteal pulse. Palpation of this pulse is 
 commonly performed by placing the person in the prone position 
with the knee  exed to relax the popliteal fascia and hamstrings. The 
pulsations are best felt in the inferior part of the fossa. Weakening 
or loss of the popliteal pulse is a sign of femoral artery obstruction.

The two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle are separated. A cutane-
ous branch of the tibial nerve joins a communicating branch of the 
common  bular (peroneal) nerve to form the sural nerve. In this speci-
men, the junction is high; usually it is 5 to 8 cm proximal to the ankle.
All motor branches in this region emerge from the tibial nerve, 
one branch from its medial side and the others from its lateral side; 
hence, it is safer to dissect on the medial side.

The common  bular (peroneal) nerve follows the posterior border of 
the biceps femoris muscle, formed centrally by the  brous capsule of 
the knee joint. The popliteal artery lies on the  oor of the popliteal 
fossa. The  oor is formed by the femur, capsule of the knee joint, and 
popliteus muscle and fascia. The popliteal artery gives off genicular 
branches that also lie on the  oor of the fossa. A popliteal aneurysm 
(abnormal dilation of all or part of the popliteal artery) usually causes 
edema (swelling) and pain in the popliteal fossa. If the femoral artery 
has to be ligated, blood can bypass the occlusion through the genicu-
lar anastomosis and reach the popliteal artery distal to the ligation.

a continuation of the quadriceps tendon, attaches the patella to 
the tibial tuberosity. The lateral and medial patellar retinacula, 
formed largely by continuation of the iliotibial tract and investing 
fascia of the vasti muscles, maintains alignment of the patella and 
patellar ligament. The retinacula also form the anterolateral and 
anteromedial portions of the  brous layer of the joint capsule of 
the knee.

B. Surface anatomy.  Numbers refer to structures labeled in (A). 
The femur is placed diagonally within the thigh, whereas the 
tibia is almost vertical within the leg, creating an angle at the 
knee between the long axes of the bones. The angle between the 
two bones, referred to clinically as the Q-angle, is assessed by 
drawing a line from the anterior superior iliac spine to the middle 
of the patella and extrapolating a second (vertical) line passing 
through the middle of the patella and tibial tuberosity. The Q-
angle is typically greater in adult females, owing to their wider 
pelves. C. Genu valgum and genu varum. A medial angulation 
of the leg in relation to the thigh, in which the femur is abnor-
mally vertical and the Q-angle is small, is a deformity called genu 
varum (bowleg) that causes unequal weight bearing resulting 
in arthrosis (destruction of knee cartilages), and an overstressed 
 bular collateral ligament. A lateral angulation of the leg (large 
Q-angle,  17 degrees) in relation to the thigh is called genu 
valgum (knock-knee). This results in excess stress and degenera-
tion of the lateral structures of the knee joint.

A. Flexed knee joint with patella re ected.  There are indenta-
tions on the sides of the femoral condyles at the junction of the 
patellar and tibial articular areas. The lateral tibial articular area is 
shorter than the medial one. The notch at the anterolateral part 
of the intercondylar notch is for the anterior cruciate ligament 
on full extension. B. Distal femur. C. Tibial plateaus. D. Articular 
surfaces of patella. The three paired facets (superior, middle, and 
inferior) on the posterior surface of the patella articulate with 
the patellar surface of the femur successively during (1) exten-
sion, (2) slight  exion, (3)  exion, and the most medial vertical 
facet on the patella (4) articulates during full  exion with the 
crescentic facet on the medial margin of the intercondylar notch 
of the femur.
When patellar dislocation occurs, it nearly always dislocates 
laterally. The tendency toward lateral dislocation is normally coun-
terbalanced by the medial, more horizontal pull of the powerful 
vastus medialis. In addition, the more anterior projection of the 
lateral femoral condyle and deeper slope for the large lateral patel-
lar facet provides a mechanical deterrent to lateral dislocation. An 
imbalance of the lateral pull and the mechanisms resisting it result 
in abnormal tracking of the patella within the patellar groove and 
chronic patellar pain, even if actual dislocation does not occur.

C. Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). In each illustration, half the 
femur is sagittally sectioned and removed with the proximal part 
of the corresponding cruciate ligament. Injury to the knee joint 
is frequently caused by a blow to the lateral side of the extended 
knee or excessive lateral twisting of the  exed knee, which disrupts 
the tibial collateral ligament and concomitantly tears and/or de-
taches the medial meniscus from the joint capsule. This injury is 
common in athletes who twist their  exed knees while running 
(e.g., in football and soccer). The ACL, which serves as a pivot for 
rotary movements of the knee, is taut during  exion and may also 
tear subsequent to the rupture of the tibial collateral ligament.

• The lateral tibial condyle is  atter, shorter from anterior to posterior, and 
more circular. The medial condyle is concave, longer from anterior to poste-
rior, and more oval.
• The menisci conform to the shapes of the surfaces on which they rest. Be-
cause the horns of the lateral meniscus are attached close together and its 
coronary ligament is slack, this meniscus can slide anteriorly and posteriorly 
on the ( at) condyle; because the horns of the medial meniscus are attached 
further apart, its movements on the (concave) condyle are restricted.
C. Arthroscopy of knee joint.
Arthroscopy is an endoscopic examination that allows visualization of the inte-
rior of the knee joint cavity with minimal disruption of tissue. The arthroscope and 
one (or more) additional cannula(e) are inserted through tiny incisions, known 
as portals. The second cannula is for passage of specialized tools. This technique 
allows removal of torn menisci, loose bodies in the joint such as bone chips, 
and debridement (the excision of devitalized articular cartilaginous material). 
Ligament repair or replacement may also be performed using an arthroscope.

A. Articularis genu (articular muscle of the knee).  This muscle lies 
deep to the vastus intermedius muscle and consists of  bers arising 
from the anterior surface of the femur proximally and attaching 
into the synovial membrane distally. The articularis genu pulls the 
synovial membrane of the suprapatellar bursa (dotted line) superi-
orly during extension of the knee so that it will not be caught be-
tween the patella and femur within the knee joint. B. Lateral aspect 
of knee. Latex was injected into the articular cavity and  xed with 
acetic acid. The distended synovial membrane was exposed and 
cleaned. The gastrocnemius muscle was re ected proximally, and 
the biceps femoris muscle and the iliotibial tract were re ected dis-
tally. The extent of the synovial capsule: superiorly, it rises superior 
to the patella, where it rests on a layer of fat that allows it to glide 
freely with movements of the joint—this superior part is called the 
suprapatellar bursa; posteriorly, it rises as high as the origin of the 
gastrocnemius muscle; laterally, it curves inferior to the lateral fem-
oral epicondyle, where the popliteus tendon and  bular collateral 
ligament are attached; and inferiorly, it bulges inferior to the lateral 
meniscus, overlapping the tibia (the coronary ligament is removed 
to show this). Prepatellar bursitis (housemaid’s knee) is usually a 
friction bursitis caused by friction between the skin and the patella. 
The suprapatellar bursa communicates with the articular cavity of 
the knee joint; consequently, abrasions or penetrating wounds su-
perior to the patella may result in suprapatellar bursitis caused by 
bacteria entering the bursa from the torn skin. The infection may 
spread to the knee joint. C. Posterior aspect of knee.

• The popliteal artery runs from the adductor hiatus (in the 
adductor magnus muscle) proximally to the inferior border 
of the popliteus muscle distally, where it bifurcates into the 
anterior and posterior tibial arteries.
• The three anterior relations of the popliteal artery include the 
femur, joint capsule of the knee, and the popliteus muscle.
• The genicular arteries participate in the formation of the 
peri-articular genicular anastomosis, a network of vessels sur-
rounding the knee that provides collateral circulation capable 
of maintaining blood supply to the leg during full knee  ex-
ion, which may kink the popliteal artery.
• Five genicular branches of the popliteal artery supply the cap-
sule and ligaments of the knee joint. The genicular arteries 
are the superior lateral, superior medial, middle, inferior lat-
eral, and inferior medial genicular arteries.
• Other contributors are the descending genicular artery, a 
branch of the femoral artery, superomedially; descending 
branch of the lateral circum ex femoral artery, superolater-
ally; and anterior tibial recurrent artery, a branch of the ante-
rior tibial artery, inferolaterally.

Pain deep to the patella often results from excessive running; 
hence, this type of pain is often called “runner’s knee.” The pain 
results from repetitive microtrauma caused by abnormal tracking of 
the patella relative to the patellar surface of the femur, a condition 
known as the patellofemoral syndrome. This syndrome may also 
result from a direct blow to the patella and from osteoarthritis of the 
patellofemoral compartment (degenerative wear and tear of articu-
lar cartilages). In some cases, strengthening of the vastus medialis 
corrects patellofemoral dysfunction. This muscle tends to prevent 
lateral dislocation of the patella resulting from the Q-angle because 
the vastus medialis attaches to and pulls on the medial border of the 
patella. Hence, weakness of the vastus medialis predisposes the indi-
vidual to patellofemoral dysfunction and patellar dislocation.

Fractures of the distal end of the femur, or lacerations of the 
anterior thigh, may involve the suprapatellar bursa and result in 
infection of the knee joint. When the knee joint is infected and 
in amed, the amount of synovial  uid may increase. Joint effu-
sions, the escape of  uid from blood or lymphatic vessels, result 
in increased amounts of  uid in the joint cavity. Because the su-
prapatellar bursa is a superior continuation of the synovial cavity 
of the knee joint, fullness of the thigh in the region of the bursa 
may indicate increased synovial  uid. This bursa can be aspirated 
to remove the  uid for examination. Direct aspiration of the knee 
joint is usually performed with the patient sitting on a table with 
the knee  exed. The joint is approached laterally, using three bony 
points as landmarks for needle insertion: the anterolateral tibial 
(Gerdy) tubercle, the lateral epicondyle of the femur, and the apex 
of the patella. In addition, this triangular area also is used for drug 
injection for treating pathology of the knee joint.

B. Dissection. The muscles of the anterior compartment are ankle

centrically contract to raise the forefoot to clear the ground dur-
ing the swing phase of the gait cycle and eccentrically contract to 
lower the forefoot to the ground after the heel strike of the stance 
phase.
Shin splints, edema, and pain in the area of the distal third 
of the tibia result from repetitive microtrauma of the anterior 
compartment muscles, especially the tibialis anterior. This pro-
duces a mild form of anterior compartment syndrome. The pain 
commonly occurs during traumatic injury or athletic overexertion 
of the muscles. Edema and muscle-tendon in ammation causes 
swelling that reduces blood  ow to the muscles. Swollen ischemic 
muscles are painful and tender to pressure.

At the ankle, the dorsalis pedis artery (dorsal artery of foot) and 
deep  bular nerve lie midway between the malleoli. On the dor-
sum of the foot, the dorsal artery of foot is crossed by the extensor 
hallucis brevis muscle and disappears between the two heads of 
the  rst dorsal interosseous muscle.
Clinically, knowing the location of the belly of the extensor 
digitorum brevis is important for distinguishing this muscle from 
abnormal edema. Contusion and tearing of the muscle  bers and 
associated blood vessels result in a hematoma in extensor digito-
rum brevis, producing edema anteromedial to the lateral malleo-
lus. Most people who have not seen this in amed muscle assume 
they have a severely sprained ankle.
The dorsalis pedis pulse may be palpated with the feet slightly 
dorsi exed. The pulse is usually easy to palpate because the dorsal 
arteries of the foot are subcutaneous and pass along a line from the 
extensor retinaculum to a point just lateral to the extensor hallucis 
longus tendon. A diminished or absent dorsalis pedis pulse usually 
suggests vascular insuf ciency resulting from arterial disease.

• The two  bular (peroneal) muscles both attach to two thirds of the 
 bula, the  bularis (peroneus) longus muscle to the proximal two 
thirds, and the  bularis (peroneus) brevis muscle to the distal two 
thirds. Where they overlap, the  bularis brevis muscle lies anteriorly.
• The  bularis (peroneus) longus muscle enters the foot by hook-
ing around the cuboid and traveling medially to the base of the 
1st metatarsal and medial cuneiform.
•  Common  bular (peroneal) nerve lesion. The nerve lies in 
contact with the neck of the  bula deep to the  bularis longus 
muscle, where it is vulnerable to injury (red circle). This injury 
may have serious implications because the nerve supplies the 
extensor and everter muscle groups, with loss of function result-
ing in footdrop (inability to dorsi ex the ankle) and dif culty in 
everting the foot.

type [S2] indicates main segmental innervation). Damage to one or more of these spinal cord segments or to motor nerve roots arising from these segments results in paralysis of the muscles concerned.

Tibial fractures. The tibial shaft is narrowest at the junction of its 
middle and inferior thirds, which is the most frequent site of fracture. 
Unfortunately, this area of the bone also has the poorest blood supply.
Fibular fractures. These commonly occur 2 to 6 cm proximal 
to the distal end of the lateral malleolus and are often associated 
with fracture/dislocations of the ankle joint, which are combined 
with tibial fractures. When a person slips and the foot is forced into 
an excessively inverted position, the ankle ligaments tear, forcibly 
tilting the talus against the lateral malleolus and shearing it off.

Gastrocnemius strain (tennis leg) is a painful calf injury result-
ing from partial tearing of the medial belly of the muscle at or near 
its musculotendinous junction. It is caused by overstretching the 
muscle during simultaneous full extension of the knee joint and 
dorsi exion of the ankle joint.

In ammation of the calcaneal tendon due to microscopic tears 
of collagen  bers in the tendon, particularly just superior to its at-
tachment to the calcaneus, results in calcaneal tendinitis, which 
causes pain during walking. Calcaneal tendon rupture is prob-
ably the most severe acute muscular problem of the leg. Following 
complete rupture of the tendon, passive dorsi exion is excessive, 
and the person cannot plantar  ex against resistance.

• Sesamoid bones form a “footstool” for the 1st metatarsal, giv-
ing it increased height.
• By inserting into the  exor digitorum longus muscle, the quadra-
tus plantae muscle modi es the oblique pull of  exor tendons.
• The  exor hallucis longus muscle uses three pulleys: grooves on 
the posterior aspect of the distal end of the tibia, on the poste-
rior aspect of the talus, and inferior to the sustentaculum tali.
• The  exor digitorum longus muscle crosses super cial to the 
tibialis posterior, superoposterior to the medial malleolus.

A. Popliteal arteriogram. The femoral artery becomes the popliteal artery 
at the adductor hiatus. The anterior tibial artery continues as the dorsa-
lis pedis (dorsal artery of the foot). The posterior tibial artery terminates 
as the medial and lateral plantar arteries; its major branch is the  bular 
artery. B. Anomalous dorsalis pedis artery. The perforating branch of the

• The superior tibio bular joint (proximal tibio bular joint) is a plane 
type of synovial joint between the  at facet on the  bular head 
and a similar facet located posterolaterally on the lateral tibial 
condyle. The tense joint capsule surrounds the joint and attaches 
to the margins of the articular surfaces of the  bula and tibia.
•  The tibio bular syndesmosis is a  brous joint. This articulation is 
essential for stability of the ankle joint because it keeps the lat-
eral malleolus  rmly against the lateral surface of the talus. The 
strong interosseous tibio bular ligament is continuous superi-
orly with the interosseous membrane and forms the principal 
connection between the distal ends of the tibia and  bula.

weight of the body is transmitted to the talus from the tibia

Plantar fasciitis, strain and in ammation of the plantar apo-
neurosis may result from running and high-impact aerobics, es-
pecially when inappropriate footwear is worn. It causes pain on 
the plantar surface of the heel and on the medial aspect of the 
foot. Point tenderness is located at the proximal attachment of 
the plantar aponeurosis to the medial tubercle of the calcaneus 
and on the medial surface of this bone. The pain increases with 
passive extension of the great toe and may be further exacer-
bated by dorsi exion of the ankle and/or weight bearing.

a Y-shaped ligament consisting of calcaneocuboid and calca-
neonavicular ligaments, and the dorsal talonavicular ligament

B. Ankle joint with joint cavity distended with injected latex.

along its medial aspect, and tibialis posterior superior to it and 
in contact with the medial (deltoid) ligament.
A Pott fracture-dislocation of the ankle occurs when the 
foot is forcibly everted. This action pulls on the extremely strong 
medial (deltoid) ligament, often avulsing the medial malleolus 
and compressing the lateral malleolus against the talus, shear-
ing off the malleolus or, more often, fracturing the  bula supe-
rior to the tibio bular syndesmosis.

latex. Observe the grooves for the  exor hallucis longus muscle, 
which crosses the middle of the ankle joint posteriorly, the two 
tendons posterior to the medial malleolus, and the two tendons 
posterior to the lateral malleolus.
• The posterior aspect of the ankle joint is strengthened by the 
transversely oriented posterior tibio bular and posterior talo-
 bular ligaments.
• The calcaneo bular ligament stabilizes the joint laterally, and 
the posterior tibiotalar and tibiocalcanean parts of the medial 
(deltoid) ligament stabilize it medially.
• The groove for the  exor hallucis tendon is between the me-
dial and lateral tubercles of the talus and continues inferior to 
the sustentaculum tali.
Calcaneal bursitis results from in ammation of the bursa of the 
calcaneal tendon located between the calcaneal tendon and the 
superior part of the posterior surface of the calcaneus. Calca-
neal bursitis causes pain posterior to the heel and occurs com-
monly during long-distance running, basketball, and tennis. It 
is caused by excessive friction on the bursa as the calcaneal ten-
don continuously slides over it.

that attaches proximally to the medial malleolus and fans out 
from it to attach distally to the talus, calcaneus, and navicular 
via four adjacent and continuous parts: the tibionavicular part, 
the tibiocalcaneal part, and the anterior and posterior tibiotalar 
parts. The medial ligament stabilizes the ankle joint during ever-
sion of the foot and prevents subluxation (partial dislocation) of 
the ankle joint. C. Normal medial longitudinal arch.

Acquired  atfeet (“fallen arches”) are likely to be secondary to dysfunction of 
the tibialis posterior due to trauma, degeneration with age, or denervation. 
In the absence of normal passive or dynamic support, the plantar calcaneo-
navicular ligament fails to support the head of the talus. Consequently, the 
head of the talus displaces inferomedially. As a result,  attening of the medial 
longitudinal arch occurs along with lateral deviation of the forefoot. Flatfeet 
are common in older people, particularly if they undertake much unaccus-
tomed standing or gain weight rapidly, adding stress on the muscles and 
increasing strain on the ligaments supporting the arches.

The lateral ligament of the ankle consists of three separate 
ligaments: (1) anterior talo bular ligament, (2) calcaneo bular 
ligament, and (3) posterior talo bular ligament (see Fig. 6.79A).
Ankle sprains (partial or fully torn ligaments) are common in-
juries. Ankle sprains nearly always result from forceful inversion of 
the weight-bearing plantar  exed foot. The anterior talo bular 
ligament is most commonly injured, resulting in instability of the 
ankle. The calcaneo bular is also often torn.

RELATIONSHIP OF ANKLE LIGAMENTS TO 
MUSCULAR AND NEUROVASCULAR 
STRUCTURES
6.84
• The  exor hallucis longus muscle is midway between the me-
dial and lateral malleoli; the tendons of the  exor digitorum 
and tibialis posterior are medial to it, and the tendons of the 
 bularis longus and brevis are lateral to it.
• The strongest parts of the ligaments of the ankle are those 
that prevent anterior displacement of the leg bones, 
namely, the posterior part of the medial ligament (posterior 
tibiotalar), the posterior talo bular, and calcaneo bular and 
tibiocalcaneal parts.
A. Superior view of talus separated from distal ends of tibia and  b-
ula. The superior articular surface of the talus is broader anteriorly 
than posteriorly. The fully dorsi exed position is stable compared 
with the fully plantar  exed position. In plantar  exion, when the 
tibia and  bula articulate with the narrower posterior part of the 
superior articular surface of the talus, some side-to-side movement 
of the joint is allowed, accounting for the instability of the joint in 
this position. B. Lateral view of talus. The triangular lateral facet is 
for articulation with the lateral malleolus. C. Medial view of talus. 
The comma-shaped medial facet is for articulation with the medial 
malleolus.

• The joints of inversion and eversion are the subtalar (posterior 
talocalcaneal) joint, talocalcaneonavicular joint, and transverse 
tarsal (combined calcaneocuboid and talonavicular) joint.
•  The talus participates in the ankle joint, of the posterior and an-
terior talocalcaneal joints, and of the talonavicular joint.
Metatarsal fractures (dancer’s fracture) usually occur when the 
dancer loses balance, putting full body weight on the metatarsal. 
Fatigue fractures of the metatarsals, usually transverse, may result 
from prolonged walking with repeated stress on the metatarsals.

The joints of inversion and eversion are the subtalar (posterior talo-
calcaneal), talocalcaneonavicular, and transverse tarsal (combined 
calcaneocuboid and talonavicular) joints. A. Posterior and middle 
parts of foot with talus removed. B. Posterior part of foot with talus 
removed. The convex posterior talar facet is separated from the 
concave middle, and anterior facets by the talocalcaneal (interos-
seous) ligament within the tarsal sinus. The posterior and anterior 
talocalcaneal joints are separated from each other by the sulcus tali 
and calcaneal sulcus, which, when the talus and calcaneus are in 
articulation, become the tarsal sinus.
Calcaneal fractures. A hard fall onto the heel (e.g., from a 
ladder) may fracture the calcaneus into several pieces, resulting 
in a comminuted fracture. A calcaneal fracture is usually disabling 
because it disrupts the subtalar (talocalcaneal) joint.

A. First metatarsal and sesamoid bones of the right great toe. The 
1st metatarsal has been re ected medially. B. Hallux valgus is a 
foot deformity caused by pressure from footwear and degenerative 
joint disease. It is characterized by lateral deviation of the base of 
the 1st metatarsal and base of the proximal phalanx of the great 
toe (L. hallux). In some people, the deviation is so great that the 
1st toe overlaps the 2nd toe. These individuals are unable to move 
their 1st digit away from their 2nd digit because the sesamoid 
bones under the head of the 1st metatarsal are displaced and lie 
in the space between the heads of the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. In 
addition, a subcutaneous bursa may form owing to pressure and 
friction against the shoe. When tender and in amed, the bursa is 
called a bunion.

The lateral (posterior) tubercle of the talus has a separate center of 
ossi cation that appears from the ages of 7 to 13 years; when this 
fails to fuse with the body of the talus, as in the left bone of this pair, 
it is called an os trigonum. It was found in Dr. Grant’s lab in 7.7% of 
558 adult feet; 22 were paired, and 21 were unpaired. C. Sesamoid 
bone in the tendon of tibialis posterior. A sesamoid bone was found 
in 23% of 348 adults. D. Sesamoid bone in the tendon of  bularis 
(peroneus) longus. A sesamoid bone was found in 26% of 92 speci-
mens. In this specimen, it is bipartite, and the  bularis (peroneus) 
longus muscle has an additional attachment to the 5th metatarsal 
bone. E. Fabella. A sesamoid bone in the lateral head of the gas-
trocnemius muscle was present in 21.6% of 116 limbs.

• The tendon of the  bularis (peroneus) longus muscle crosses 
the sole of the foot in the groove anterior to the tuberosity 
of the cuboid, is bridged by some  bers of the long plantar 
ligament, and inserts into the base of the 1st metatarsal.
• Observe the slips of the tibialis posterior tendon extending to 
the bones anterior to the transverse tarsal joint.

• The plantar calcaneocuboid (short plantar) and plantar calca-
neonavicular (spring) ligaments are the primary plantar liga-
ments of the transverse tarsal joint.
• The ligaments of the anterior foot diverge laterally and pos-
teriorly from each side of the long axis of the 3rd metatarsal 
and 3rd cuneiform; hence, a posterior thrust received by the 
1st metatarsal, as when rising on the big toe while in walking, 
is transmitted directly to the navicular and talus by the  rst 
cuneiform and indirectly by the 2nd metatarsal, 2nd cunei-
form, 3rd metatarsal, and 3rd cuneiform.
• A posterior thrust received by the 4th and 5th metatarsals is 
transmitted directly to the cuboid and calcaneus.

Compartmental infections in the leg. Because the septa 
and deep fascia forming the boundaries of the leg compart-

with suppuration (formation of pus) increases intracompart-
mental pressure. In ammation within the anterior and posterior 
compartments spreads chie y in a distal direction; however, a 
purulent infection in the lateral compartment can ascend proxi-
mally into the popliteal fossa, presumably along the course of 
the  bular nerve. Fasciotomy may be necessary to relieve com-
partmental pressure and debride (remove by scraping) pockets 
of infection.

Compared with the adult skull (Figs. 7.2 to 7.4):
• The maxilla and mandible are proportionately small.
• The mandibular symphysis, which closes during the second 
year, and the frontal suture, which closes during the sixth year 
are still open (unfused).
•  The orbital cavities are proportionately large, but the face is 
small; the facial skeleton forming only one eighth of the whole 
cranium, while in the adult, it forms one third.

• The parietal eminence is a shallow, rounded cone. Ossi cation, 
which starts at the eminences, has not yet reached the ultimate 
four angles of the parietal bone; accordingly, these regions 
are membranous, and the membrane is blended with the 
pericranium externally and the dura mater internally to form 
the fontanelles. The fontanelles are usually closed by the second 
year. There is no mastoid process until the second year.

Extraction of teeth causes the alveolar bone to resorb in the 
affected region(s). Following complete loss or extraction of teeth, 
the sockets begin to  ll in with bone, and the alveolar processes 
begin to resorb. The mental foramen may eventually lie near the 
superior border of the body of the mandible. In some cases, mental 
foramina resorption may extend to the mental nerves, exposing 
them to injury.

A. Bony cranium. B. Cranium with bones color-coded. The cra-

portions of cranial bones that transfer forces around the weaker 
regions of the orbits and nasal cavity.
The convexity of the neurocranium (braincase) distributes and 
thereby minimizes the effects of a blow to it. However, hard blows 
to the head in thin areas of the cranium (e.g., in the temporal fossa) 
are likely to produce depressed fractures, in which a fragment of 
bone is depressed inward, compressing and/or injuring the brain. 
In comminuted fractures, the bone is broken into several pieces. 
Linear fractures, the most frequent type, usually occur at the 
point of impact, but fracture lines often radiate away from it in two 
or more directions.

If the area of the neurocranium is thick at the site of impact, the 
bone usually bends inward without fracturing; however, a fracture 
may occur some distance from the site of direct trauma where the 
calvaria is thinner. In a contrecoup (counterblow) fracture, the 
fracture occurs on the opposite side of the cranium rather than at 
the point of impact. One or more sutural (accessory) bones may 
be located along the lambdoid suture or near the mastoid process.

A. The lambda, near the center of this convex surface, is located 
at the junction of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures. B. The roof 
of the neurocranium, or calvaria (skullcap), is formed primarily 
by the paired parietal bones, the frontal bone, and the occipital 
bone.
Premature closure of the coronal suture results in a high, towerlike 
cranium, called oxycephaly or turricephaly. Premature closure of 
sutures usually does not affect brain development. When prema-
ture closure occurs on one side only, the cranium is asymmetrical, 
a condition known as plagiocephaly.

posterior clinoid processes form its superolateral corners.
• The clivus is the slope descending from the dorsum sellae to the 
foramen magnum.
•  The grooves for the sigmoid sinus and inferior petrosal sinus lead 
inferiorly to the jugular foramen.
Premature closure of the sagittal suture, in which the anterior 
fontanelle is small or absent, results in a long, narrow, wedge-
shaped cranium, a condition called scaphocephaly.

• Fractures in the  oor of the anterior cranial fossa may in-
volve the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, resulting in leakage 
of CSF through the nose (CSF rhinorrhea). CSF rhinorrhea 
may be a primary indication of a cranial base fracture which 
increases the risk of meningitis, because an infection could 
spread to the meninges from the ear or nose.

In B, note the following midline features:
• In the anterior cranial fossa, the frontal crest and crista galli for 
anterior attachment of the falx cerebri have between them the 
foramen cecum, which, during development, transmits a vein 
connecting the superior sagittal sinus with the veins of the fron-
tal sinus and root of the nose.
• In the middle cranial fossa, the tuberculum sellae, hypophysial 
fossa, dorsum sellae, and posterior clinoid processes constitute 
the sella turcica (L. Turkish saddle).
•  In the posterior cranial fossa, note the clivus, foramen magnum, 
internal occipital crest for attachment of the falx cerebelli, and 
the internal occipital protuberance, from which the grooves for 
the transverse sinuses course laterally.

Observe in A:
• The labeled features include the superior orbital  ssure (Sr), lesser wing of the 
sphenoid (S), superior surface of the petrous part of the temporal bone (T ), 
crista galli (C), frontal sinus (F ), mandible (MN), maxillary sinus (M), and diploic 
veins (DP).
• The nasal septum is formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid (E ) and the 
vomer (V ); note the inferior and middle conchae (I ) of the lateral wall of the nose.
• Superimposed on the facial skeleton are the dens (D) and lateral masses of the 
atlas (A).

• The muscles of facial expression are the super cial sphincters 
and dilators of the openings of the head; all are supplied by the 
facial nerve (CN VII). The masseter and temporalis (the latter 
covered here by temporal fascia) are muscles of mastication that 
are innervated by the trigeminal nerve (CN V).
•  Super cial temporal and facial artery pulses. Anesthesiolo-
gists, usually stationed at the head of the operating table, take 
these pulses. The super cial temporal pulse is palpated ante-
rior to the auricle as the artery crosses the zygomatic arch. The 
facial pulse is palpated where the facial artery crosses the inferior 
border of the mandible immediately anterior to the masseter.

• The parotid duct extends across the masseter muscle just inferior 
to the zygomatic arch; the duct turns medially to pierce the buc-
cinator and opens into the oral vestibule.
• The facial nerve (CN VII) innervates the muscles of facial expres-
sion. After emerging from the stylomastoid foramen, the main 
stem of the facial nerve has posterior auricular, digastric, and 
stylohyoid branches; the parotid plexus gives rise to temporal 
(T ), zygomatic (Z ), buccal (B), marginal mandibular (M), cervi-
cal (C ), and posterior auricular branches. These branches form a 
plexus within the parotid gland, the branches of which radiate 
over the face, anastomosing with each other and the branches 
of the trigeminal nerve.
•  During parotidectomy (surgical excision of the parotid gland), 
identi cation, dissection, and preservation of the branches of 
the facial nerve are critical.
•  The parotid gland may become infected by infectious agents 
that pass through the bloodstream, as occurs in mumps, an 
acute communicable viral disease. Infection of the gland causes 
in ammation, parotiditis, and swelling of the gland. Severe 
pain occurs because the parotid sheath, innervated by the great 
auricular nerve, is distended by swelling.

Injury to the facial nerve (CN VII) or its branches produces pa-
ralysis of some or all of the facial muscles on the affected side (Bell 
facial palsy). The affected area sags, and facial expression is dis-
torted. The loss of tonus causes the inferior lid to evert (fall away 
from the surface of the eyeball). As a result, the lacrimal  uid is not 
spread over the cornea, preventing adequate lubrication, hydra-
tion, and  ushing of the cornea. This makes the cornea vulnerable 
to ulceration. If the injury weakens or paralyzes the buccinator and 
orbicularis oris, food will accumulate in the oral vestibule during 
chewing, usually requiring continual removal with a  nger. When 
the sphincters or dilators of the mouth are affected, displacement 
of the mouth (drooping of the corner) is produced by gravity and 
contraction of unopposed contralateral facial muscles, resulting in 
food and saliva dribbling out of the side of the mouth. Weakened 
lip muscles affect speech. Affected people cannot whistle or blow 
a wind instrument effectively. They frequently dab their eyes and 
mouth with a handkerchief to wipe the  uid (tears and saliva) that 
runs from the drooping lid and mouth.
Because the face does not have a distinct layer of deep fascia and 
the subcutaneous tissue is loose between the attachments of facial 
muscles, facial lacerations tend to gap (part widely). Consequently, 
the skin must be sutured carefully to prevent scarring. The looseness 
of the subcutaneous tissue also enables  uid and blood to accumu-
late in the loose connective tissue causing bruising of the face.

Most super cial arteries of the face are branches or derivatives of 
the external carotid artery. The facial artery, a branch of the exter-
nal carotid artery, provides the major arterial supply to the face. The 
facial artery winds its way to the inferior border of the mandible, 
just anterior to the masseter, and then courses over the face to the 
medial angle (canthus) of the eye, where the superior and inferior 
eyelids meet.

Scalp injuries and infections. The loose areolar tissue layer is 
the danger area of the scalp because pus or blood spreads easily 
in it. Infection in this layer can pass into the cranial cavity through 
emissary veins, which pass through parietal foramina in the cal-
varia and reach intracranial structures such as the meninges. An 
infection cannot pass into the neck because the occipital belly of 
the occipitofrontalis attaches to the occipital bone and mastoid 
parts of the temporal bones. Neither can a scalp infection spread 
laterally beyond the zygomatic arches because the epicranial apo-
neurosis is continuous with the temporalis fascia that attaches to 
these arches. An infection or  uid (e.g., pus or blood) can enter the 
eyelids and the root of the nose because the frontal belly of the oc-
cipitofrontalis inserts into the skin and dense subcutaneous tissue 
and does not attach to the bone. Ecchymoses, or purple patches, 
develop as a result of extravasation of blood into the subcutaneous 
tissue, skin of the eyelids and surrounding regions.

A. Cranium and meninges. The three meningeal spaces include the 
extradural (epidural) space between the cranial bones and dura, 
which is a potential space normally (it becomes a real space patho-
logically if blood accumulates in it); the similarly potential subdu-
ral space between the dura and arachnoid; and the subarachnoid 
space, the normal realized space between the arachnoid and pia, 
which contains cerebrospinal  uid (CSF). B. Extradural (epidural) 
hematomas result from bleeding from a torn middle meningeal 
artery. C. Dural border (subdural) hematomas commonly result 
from tearing of a cerebral vein as it enters the superior sagittal 
sinus. D. Subarachnoid hemorrhage results from bleeding within 
the subarachnoid space (e.g., from rupture of an aneurysm).

• The calvaria is removed. In the median plane, the thick roof 
of the superior sagittal sinus is partly pinned aside, and laterally, 
the thin roofs of two lateral lacunae are re ected.
• The middle meningeal artery courses with the middle meningeal 
veins, which enlarge superiorly and drain into a lateral lacunae. 
Other channels drain the lateral lacunae into the superior sagit-
tal sinus.
• Arachnoid granulations in the lacunae are responsible for 
absorption of CSF from the subarachnoid space into the venous 
system.
•  The dura is sensitive to pain, especially where it is related to 
the dural venous sinuses and meningeal arteries. Although the 
causes of headache are numerous, distention of the scalp or 
meningeal vessels (or both) is believed to be one cause of head-
ache. Many headaches appear to be dural in origin, such as the 
headache occurring after a lumbar spinal puncture for removal 
of CSF. These headaches are thought to result from stimulation 
of sensory nerve endings in the dura.

VENOUS SINUSES OF DURA MATER 7.25
A. Schematic of left half of cranial cavity and right 
facial skeleton. B. Venous sinuses of the cranial base.
• The superior sagittal sinus is at the superior 
border of the falx cerebri, and the inferior sag-
ittal sinus is in its free border. The great cerebral 
vein joins the inferior sagittal sinus to form the 
straight sinus.
• The superior sagittal sinus usually becomes the 
right transverse sinus, which drains into the 
right sigmoid sinus, and next into the right in-
ternal jugular vein; the straight sinus similarly 
drains through the left transverse sinus, left sig-
moid sinus, and left internal jugular vein.
• The cavernous sinus communicates with the 
veins of the face through the ophthalmic veins 
and pterygoid plexus of veins and with the sig-
moid sinus through the superior and inferior 
petrosal sinuses.
•  Metastasis of tumor cells to dural sinuses. 
The basilar and occipital sinuses communicate 
through the foramen magnum with the inter-
nal vertebral venous plexuses. Because these 
venous channels are valveless, increased intra-
abdominopelvic or intrathoracic pressure, as 
occurs during heavy coughing and straining, 
may force venous blood from these regions 
into the internal vertebral venous system and 
from it into the dural venous sinuses. As a re-
sult, pus in abscesses and tumor cells in these 
regions may spread to the vertebrae and brain.

• The facial (CN VII) and vestibulocochlear (CN VIII) 
nerves course laterally to enter the internal acous-
tic meatus.
• The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) pierces the 
dura mater separately but passes with the vagus 
(CN X) and spinal accessory (CN XI) nerves 
through the jugular foramen.
• An acoustic neuroma (neuro broma) is a slow-
growing benign tumor of the neurolemma 
(Schwann) cells. The tumor begins in the ves-
tibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) while it is in the 
internal acoustic meatus. The early symptom of 
an acoustic neuroma is usually loss of hearing. 
Dysequilibrium and tinnitus also may occur.

• The brain has been removed by cutting through the midbrain, 
revealing the tentorial notch through which the brainstem 
extends from the posterior into the middle cranial fossa.
• On the right side of the specimen, the tentorium cerebelli is di-
vided and re ected. The trochlear nerve (CN IV) passes around 
the midbrain under the free edge of the tentorium cerebelli; 
the roots of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) enter the mouth of the 
trigeminal cave.
• There is a circular opening in the diaphragma sellae for the 
infundibulum, the stalk of the pituitary gland.
• The oculomotor nerve (CN III) passes between the posterior ce-
rebral and superior cerebellar arteries and then laterally around 
the posterior clinoid process.
•  The tentorial notch is the opening in the tentorium cerebelli 
for the brainstem, which is slightly larger than is necessary to 
accommodate the midbrain. Hence, space-occupying lesions, 
such as tumors in the supratentorial compartment, produce 
increased intracranial pressure that may cause part of the adja-
cent temporal lobe of the brain to herniate through the tentorial 
notch. During tentorial herniation, the temporal lobe may be 
lacerated by the tough tentorium cerebelli, and the oculomotor 
nerve (CN III) may be stretched, compressed, or both. Oculo-
motor lesions may produce paralysis of the extrinsic eye muscles 
supplied by CN III.

In fractures of the cranial base, the internal carotid artery may 
be torn, producing an arteriovenous  stula within the cavernous 
sinus. Arterial blood rushes into the sinus, enlarging it and forcing 
retrograde blood  ow into its venous tributaries, especially the oph-
thalmic veins. As a result, the eyeball protrudes (exophthalmos) 
and the conjunctiva becomes engorged (chemosis). Because 
CN III, CN IV, CN VI, CN V1, and CN V2 lie in or close to the lateral 
wall of the cavernous sinus, these nerves may also be affected.

The anterior part of the left temporal lobe is removed to enable 
visualization of the middle cerebral artery in the lateral  ssure. The 
frontal lobes are separated to expose the anterior cerebral arteries 
and corpus callosum.
An ischemic stroke denotes the sudden development of neu-
rological de cits that are consequences of impaired cerebral blood 
 ow. The most common causes of strokes are spontaneous cere-
brovascular accidents such as cerebral embolism, thrombosis, or 
hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (Rowland, 2000). 
The cerebral arterial circle is an important means of collateral cir-
culation in the event of gradual obstruction of one of the major 
arteries forming the circle. Sudden occlusion, even if only partial, 
results in neurological de cits. In elderly persons, the anastomoses 
are often inadequate when a large artery (e.g., internal carotid) is 
occluded, even if the occlusion is gradual. In such cases, function 
is impaired at least to some degree.
Hemorrhagic stroke follows the rupture of an artery or a saccu-
lar aneurysm, a saclike dilation on a weak part of the arterial wall. 
The most common type of saccular aneurysm is a berry aneurysm, 
occurring in the vessels of or near the cerebral arterial circle. In 
time, especially in people with hypertension (high blood pressure), 
the weak part of the arterial wall expands and may rupture, allow-
ing blood to enter the subarachnoid space.

Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) refer to neurological symp-
toms resulting from ischemia (de cient blood supply) of the brain. 
The symptoms of a TIA may be ambiguous: staggering, dizziness, 
light-headedness, fainting, and paresthesias (e.g., tingling in a 
limb). Most TIAs last a few minutes, but some persist longer. Indi-
viduals with TIAs are at increased risk for myocardial infarction and 
ischemic stroke (Brust, 2000)

palpebral conjunctiva (B). When powerful blows impact directly 
on the bony rim of the orbit, the resulting orbital fractures usually 
occur at the sutures between the bones forming the orbital mar-
gin. Fractures of the inferior wall may involve the maxillary sinus; 
fractures of the medial wall are less common and may involve the 
ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses. Although the superior wall is 
stronger, it is thin enough to be translucent and may be readily 
penetrated. Thus, a sharp object may pass through it into the 
frontal lobe of the brain. Orbital fractures often result in intra-
orbital bleeding, which exerts pressure on the eyeball, causing 
exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeball).

lacrimal apparatus. Tears, secreted by the lacrimal gland (L) in the 
superolateral angle of the bony orbit, pass across the eyeball and 
enter the lacus lacrimalis (lacrimal lake) at the medial angle of the 
eye; from here they drain through the lacrimal puncta and lacrimal 
canaliculi (C) to the lacrimal sac (S). The lacrimal sac drains into 
the nasolacrimal duct (N), which empties into the inferior meatus 
(I) of the nose.

A. Super cial dissection. On the right side of A, the orbital plate of the 
frontal bone is removed. On the left side of A, the levator palpebrae and 
superior rectus muscles are re ected.
• The trochlear nerve (CN IV) lies on the medial side of the superior 
oblique muscle, and the abducent nerve (CN VI) on the medial side of 
the lateral rectus muscle.
• The lacrimal nerve runs superior to the lateral rectus muscle supply-
ing sensory  bers to the conjunctiva and skin of the superior eyelid; it 
receives a communicating branch of the zygomaticotemporal nerve 
carrying secretory motor  bers from the pterygopalatine ganglion 
prior to entering or within the lacrimal gland.
• The parasympathetic ciliary ganglion, placed between the lateral 
rectus muscle and the optic nerve (CN II), gives rise to many short 
ciliary nerves; the nasociliary nerve gives rise to two long ciliary nerves 
that anastomose with each other and the short ciliary nerves.
B. Distribution of nerve  bers to ciliary ganglion and eyeball.
Horner syndrome results from interruption of a cervical sympathetic 
trunk and is manifest by the absence of sympathetically stimulated 
functions on the ipsilateral side of the head. The syndrome includes 
the following signs: constriction of the pupil (miosis), drooping of the 
superior eyelid (ptosis), redness and increased temperature of the skin 
(vasodilatation), and absence of sweating (anhydrosis).
• The ciliary ganglion receives sensory  bers from the nasociliary 
branches of CN VI, postsynaptic sympathetic  bers from the continu-
ation of the internal carotid plexus extending along the ophthalmic 
artery, and presynaptic parasympathetic  bers from the inferior branch 
of the oculomotor nerve; only the latter synapse in the ganglion.

C. Deep dissection before (left side of specimen) and after (right side of specimen) section 
of the optic nerve (CN II). D. Transverse (axial) MRI of orbital cavity. The numbers refer 
to structures labeled in C.
Observe on the right side of C:
• The eyeball occupies the anterior half of the orbital cavity.
Observe on the left of C:
• The parasympathetic ciliary ganglion lies posteriorly between the lateral rectus muscle 
and the sheath of the optic nerve.
• The nasociliary nerve (CN V1) sends a branch to the ciliary ganglion and crosses the 
optic nerve (CN II), where it gives off two long ciliary nerves (sensory to the eyeball 
and cornea) and the posterior ethmoidal nerve (to the sphenoidal sinus and posterior 
ethmoidal cells). The nasociliary nerve then divides into the anterior ethmoidal and 
infratrochlear nerves.
• Complete oculomotor nerve palsy affects four of the six ocular muscles, the levator 
palpebrae superioris, and the sphincter pupillae. The superior eyelid droops (ptosis) 
and cannot be raised voluntarily because of the unopposed activity of the orbicularis 
oculi (supplied by the facial nerve). The pupil is also fully dilated and nonreactive 
because of the unopposed dilator pupillae. The pupil is fully abducted and depressed 
(“down and out”) because of the unopposed activity of the lateral rectus and superior 
oblique, respectively.
• A lesion of the abducent nerve results in loss of lateral gaze to the ipsilateral side 
because of paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle. On forward gaze, the eye is diverted 
medially because of the lack of normal resting tone in the lateral rectus, resulting in 
diplopia (double vision).

• Foreign objects, such as sand or metal  lings, produce corneal 
abrasions that cause sudden, stabbing eye pain and tears. Open-
ing and closing the eyelids is also painful. Corneal lacerations 
are caused by sharp objects such as  ngernails or the corner of a 
page of a book.
• Any of the glands in the eyelid may become in amed and swol-
len from infection or obstruction of their ducts. If the ducts of 
the ciliary glands are obstructed, a painful red suppurative (pus-
producing) swelling, a sty (hordeolum), develops on the eyelid. 
Obstruction of a tarsal gland produces in ammation, a tarsal 
chalazion, that protrudes toward the eyeball and rubs against it 
as the eyelids blink.

A. The line of pull of the muscles relative to 
the eyeball and the axes around which move-
ments occur. The orientation of the orbit is 
important in understanding the actions of 
the extra-ocular muscles. The common ten-
dinous ring (origin of the recti), the origin of 
the inferior oblique, and the trochlea of the 
superior oblique all lie medial to the eyeball 
and to the anteroposterior (A-P) and vertical 
axes. (a) The medial and lateral recti are the 
primary adductors and abductors of the eye-
ball. However, when movements begin from 
the primary position (gaze directed anteriorly 
along the A-P axis): (1) The line of pull of the 
superior and inferior rectus muscles passes 
medial and anterior to the vertical axis, re-
sulting in secondary actions of adduction; 
and (2) the line of pull of the superior and 
inferior oblique muscles passes medial and 
posterior to the vertical axis, resulting in sec-
ondary actions of abduction. (b) Pulling in 
opposite directions relative to the transverse 
axis, the superior rectus and inferior oblique 
muscles are synergistic elevators, and the in-
ferior rectus and superior oblique are syner-
gistic depressors. (c) Medial pull produced 
by the muscles attaching to the superior eye-
ball (superior rectus and oblique) produces 
secondary actions of medial rotation (intor-
sion), and that produced by muscles attach-
ing to the inferior eyeball (inferior rectus and 
oblique) produces lateral rotation (extorsion). 
B. Movements produced by isolated contrac-
tion of the four rectus and two oblique mus-
cles, starting from the primary position. Large 
arrows indicate prime movers for the six car-
dinal movements. Movements in directions 
between large arrows (e.g., vertical elevation 
or depression) require synergistic actions of 
adjacent muscles. Contralaterally paired mus-
cles that work synergistically to direct parallel 
binocular gaze are called yoke muscles. For 
example, the right LR and left MR act as yoke 
muscles in directing gaze to the right.

A. Pattern of movement of pupil used for
clinical testing of extra-ocular muscles.
Patient is asked to follow movement of
examiner’s finger, tracing an “H” pattern.
Most movements from the primary position involve synergists. 
When testing the extra-ocular muscles (usually to determine 
the integrity of the involved motor nerve), it is desirable to iso-
late muscle activity. If the pupil is  rst adducted (MR—CN III) so 
that the direction of gaze coincides with the line of pull of the 
oblique muscles, only the SO (CN IV) can depress and only the IO 
(CN III) can elevate the pupil. If the pupil is  rst abducted (LR—CN 
VI) so that the direction of gaze coincides with the line of pull of 
the superior and inferior recti, only these muscles can elevate and 
depress the pupil (superior and inferior divisions of CN III).

Orbital tum ors. Because of the closeness of the optic nerve 
to the sphenoidal and posterior ethmoidal sinuses, a malig-
nant tumor in these sinuses may erode the thin bony walls of 
the orbit and compress the optic nerve and orbital contents. 
Tumors in the orbit produce exophthalm os (protrusion of eye-
ball). Tumors in the middle cranial fossa enter the orbital cavity 
through the superior orbital  ssure. Tumors in the temporal or 
infratemporal fossae enter the orbit through the inferior orbital 
 ssure.

Blockage of central retinal artery. The terminal branches of 
the central retinal artery are end arteries. Obstruction of the artery 
by an embolus results in instant and total blindness. Blockage of 
the artery is usually unilateral and occurs in older people. B. Veins. 
The superior and inferior ophthalmic veins receive the vorticose 
veins from the eyeball and drain into the cavernous sinus posteri-
orly and the pterygoid plexus inferiorly. They communicate with 
the facial and supra-orbital veins anteriorly.
• The facial veins make clinically important connections with 
the cavernous sinus through the superior ophthalmic veins. 
Cavernous sinus thrombosis usually results from infections in 
the orbit, nasal sinuses, and superior part of the face (the danger 
triangle). In persons with thrombophlebitis of the facial vein, 
pieces of an infected thrombus may extend into the cavernous 
sinus, producing thrombophlebitis of the cavernous sinus. 
The infection usually involves only one sinus initially but may 
spread to the opposite side through the intercavernous sinuses.
•  Blockade of central retinal vein. The central retinal vein enters 
the cavernous sinus. Thrombophlebitis of this sinus may result in 
passage of a thrombus to the central retinal vein and produce a 
blockage in one of the small retinal veins. Occlusion of a branch 
of the central vein of the retina usually results in slow, painless 
loss of vision.

scleral venous sinus (also called the sinus venosus sclerae or canal 
of Schlemm). Glaucoma. If drainage of the aqueous humor is re-
duced signi cantly, pressure builds up in the chambers of the eye 
(glaucoma). Blindness can result from compression of the inner 
layer of the retina and retinal arteries if aqueous humor production 
is not reduced to maintain normal intra-ocular pressure.

A. Right ocular fundus, ophthalmoscopic view. Retinal venules 
(wider) and retinal arterioles (narrower) radiate from the center 
of the oval optic disc, formed in relation to the entry of the optic 
nerve into the eyeball. The round, dark area lateral to the disc is the 
macula; branches of vessels extend to this area but do not reach its 
center, the fovea centralis, a depressed spot that is the area of most 
acute vision. It is avascular but, like the rest of the outermost (cones 
and rods) layer of the retina, is nourished by the adjacent chorio-
capillaris. Increased intracranial pressure is transmitted through the 
CSF in the subarachnoid space surrounding the optic nerve, caus-
ing the optic disc to protrude. The protrusion, called papilledema, 
is apparent during ophthalmoscopy. B. Blood supply to eyeball. 
The eyeball has three layers: (1) the external,  brous layer is the 
sclera and cornea; (2) the middle, vascular layer is the choroid, cili-
ary body, and iris; and (3) the internal, neural layer or retina consists 
of a pigment cell layer and a neural layer. The central artery of the 
retina, a branch of the ophthalmic artery, is an end artery. Of the 
eight posterior ciliary arteries, six are short posterior ciliary arteries 
and supply the choroid, which in turn nourishes the outer, non-
vascular layer of the retina. Two long posterior ciliary arteries, one 
on each side of the eyeball, run between the sclera and choroid to 
anastomose with the anterior ciliary arteries, which are derived from 
muscular branches. The choroid is drained by posterior ciliary veins, 
and four to  ve vorticose veins that drain into the ophthalmic veins.

• The temporal region is the region of the head that in-
cludes the lateral area of the scalp and the deeper soft 
tissues overlying the temporal fossa of the cranium, 
superior to the zygomatic arch. The temporal fossa, 
occupied primarily by the upper portion of the tempo-
ralis muscle, is bounded by the inferior temporal lines 
(see Fig. 7.3B).
• The infratemporal fossa is an irregularly shaped space 
deep and inferior to the zygomatic arch, deep to the 
ramus of the mandible and posterior to the maxilla. 
It communicates with the temporal fossa through the 
interval between the zygomatic arch and the cranial 
bones.

act on the mandible.
•  The sternocleidomastoid muscle, supplied by the spinal acces-
sory nerve (CN XI), is the chief  exor of the head and neck; it

TEMPORAL REGION AND INFRATEMPORAL FOSSA
A. Super cial dissection.
• The maxillary artery, the larger of two terminal branches of the 
external carotid, is divided into three parts relative to the lateral 
pterygoid muscle.
• The buccinator is pierced by the parotid duct, the ducts of the 
buccal glands, and sensory branches of the buccal nerve.
• The lateral pterygoid muscle arises by two heads, one head 
from the roof, and the other head from the medial wall of the 
infratemporal fossa; both heads insert in relation to the tem-
poromandibular joint—the superior head attaching primarily 
to the articular disc of the joint and the inferior head primarily 
to the anterior aspect of the neck of the mandible (pterygoid 
fovea).
•  Because of the close relationship of the facial and auriculotempo-
ral nerves to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), care must be 
taken during surgical procedures on the temporomandibular 
joint to preserve both the branches of the facial nerve overlying 
it and the articular branches of the auriculotemporal nerve that 
enter the posterior part of the joint. Injury to articular branches 
of the auriculotemporal nerve supplying the TMJ—associated 
with traumatic dislocation and rupture of the joint capsule and 
lateral ligament—leads to laxity and instability of the TMJ.

• The lateral pterygoid muscle and most of the branches of the 
maxillary artery have been removed to expose the mandibular 
nerve (CN V3) entering the infratemporal fossa through the fora-
men ovale and the middle meningeal artery passing through the 
foramen spinosum.
•  The deep head of the medial pterygoid muscle arises from the 
medial surface of the lateral pterygoid plate and the pyramidal 
process of the palatine bone. It has a small, super cial head that 
arises from the tuberosity of the maxilla.
•  The inferior alveolar and lingual nerves descend on the medial 
pterygoid muscle. The inferior alveolar nerve gives off the nerve 
to mylohyoid and nerve to anterior belly of the digastric muscle, 
and the lingual nerve receives the chorda tympani, which carries 
secretory parasympathetic  bers and  bers of taste.
•  Motor nerves arising from CN V3 supply the four muscles of mas-
tication: the masseter, temporalis, and lateral and medial ptery-
goids. The buccal nerve from the mandibular nerve is sensory; 
the buccal branch of the facial nerve is the motor supply to the 
buccinator muscle.
• To perform a mandibular nerve block, an anesthetic agent is in-
jected near the mandibular nerve where it enters the infratemporal 
fossa. This block usually anesthetizes the auriculotemporal, inferior 
alveolar, lingual, and buccal branches of the mandibular nerve.

• The maxillary artery arises at the neck of the mandible and is 
divided into three parts (mandibular, pterygoid, and pterygo-
palatine) by the lateral pterygoid muscle; it can pass medial or 
lateral to the lateral pterygoid.
• The branches of the  rst (mandibular) part pass through foram-
ina or canals: the deep auricular to the external acoustic meatus, 
the anterior tympanic to the tympanic cavity, the middle and ac-
cessory meningeal to the cranial cavity, and the inferior alveolar 
to the mandible and teeth.
•  The branches of the second (pterygoid) part, directly related to 
the lateral pterygoid muscle, supply muscles via the masseteric, 
deep temporal, pterygoid, and buccal branches.
•  The branches of the third (pterygopalatine) part (posterior su-
perior alveolar, infra-orbital, descending palatine, and spheno-
palatine arteries) arise immediately proximal to and within the 
pterygopalatine fossa.

An alveolar nerve block—commonly used by dentists when re-

a branch of CN V3. The anesthetic agent is injected around the 
mandibular foramen, the opening into the mandibular canal on 
the medial aspect of the ramus of the mandible. This canal gives 
passage to the inferior alveolar nerve, artery, and vein. When this 
nerve block is successful, all mandibular teeth are anesthetized to 
the median plane. The skin and mucous membrane of the lower 
lip, the labial alveolar mucosa and gingiva, and the skin of the 
chin are also anesthetized because they are supplied by the mental 
branch of this nerve.

Temporomandibular joint movements are produced chie y by the 
muscles of mastication. These four muscles (temporalis, masse-
ter, and medial and lateral pterygoid muscles) develop from the 
mesoderm of the  rst pharyngeal arch; consequently, they are in-
nervated by the nerve of that arch, the motor root of the mandibu-
lar nerve (CN V3).

lar ligament descends from near the spine of the sphenoid to the 
lingula of the mandible and is the “swinging hinge” by which 
the mandible is suspended; the weaker stylomandibular liga-
ment is a thickened part of the parotid sheath that joins the sty-
loid process to the angle of the mandible.

A. Parts of tongue. B. Features of dorsum of the tongue. The 
foramen cecum is the upper end of the primitive thyroglossal 
duct; the arms of the V-shaped terminal sulcus diverge from the 
foramen, demarcating the posterior third of the tongue from the 
anterior two thirds. C. Lymphatic drainage of dorsum of tongue. 
D. Lymphatic drainage of tongue, mouth, nasal cavity, and nose.
Carcinoma of tongue. Malignant tumors in the posterior part 
of the tongue metastasize to the superior deep cervical lymph 
nodes on both sides. In contrast, tumors in the apex and an-
terolateral parts usually do not metastasize to the inferior deep 
cervical nodes until late in the disease. Because the deep nodes are 
closely related to the internal jugular vein (IJV), metastases from 
the carcinoma may spread to the submental and submandibular 
regions and along the IJV into the neck.
Gag re ex. One may touch the anterior part of the tongue 
without feeling discomfort; however, when the posterior part 
is touched, one usually gags. CN IX and CN X are respon-
sible for the muscular contraction of each side of the pharynx. 
Glossopharyngeal branches (CN IX) provide the afferent limb of 
the gag re ex.

Sialography. The parotid and submandibular salivary glands 
may be examined radiographically after the injection of a contrast 
medium into their ducts. This special type of radiograph (sialogram) 
demonstrates the salivary ducts and some secretory units. 
Because of the small size and number of sublingual ducts of the 
sublingual glands, one cannot usually inject contrast medium into 
them.

A. The viscerocranium has been sectioned at the C1 vertebral 
level, the plane of section passing through the oral  ssure ante-
riorly. The retropharyngeal space (opened up in this specimen) 
allows the pharynx to contract and relax during swallowing; the 
retropharyngeal space is closed laterally at the carotid sheath and 
limited posteriorly by the prevertebral fascia. The beds of the 
parotid glands are also demonstrated. B. Schematic coronal sec-
tion demonstrating how the tongue and buccinator (or, anteri-
orly, the orbicularis oris) work together to retain food between 
the teeth when chewing. The buccinator and superior part of the 
orbicularis oris are innervated by the buccal branch of the facial 
nerve (CN VII).

A. Median section though the tongue and lower jaw. The tongue 
is composed mainly of muscle; extrinsic muscles alter the position 
of the tongue, and intrinsic muscles alter its shape. The genioglos-
sus is the extrinsic muscle apparent in this plane, and the superior 
longitudinal muscle is the intrinsic muscle. B. Muscles of the  oor 
of the mouth viewed posterosuperiorly. The mylohyoid muscle ex-
tends between the two mylohyoid lines of the mandible. It has a 
thick, free posterior border and becomes thinner anteriorly.
Genioglossus paralysis. When the genioglossus is paralyzed, 
the tongue mass has a tendency to shift posteriorly, obstructing 
the airway and presenting the risk of suffocation. Total relaxation 
of the genioglossus muscles occurs during general anesthesia; 
therefore, the tongue of an anesthetized patient must be pre-
vented from relapsing by inserting an airway.

the lesser palatine nerves the soft palate. Anesthesia of palatine 
nerves. The nasopalatine nerves can be anesthetized by injecting 
anesthetic into the mouth of the incisive fossa in the hard pal-
ate. The anesthetized tissues are the palatal mucosa, the lingual 
gingivae, the six anterior maxillary teeth, and associated alveolar 
bone. The greater palatine nerve can be anesthetized by injecting 
anesthetic into the greater palatine foramen. The nerve emerges 
between the second and third maxillary molar teeth. This nerve 
block anesthetizes the palatal mucosa and lingual gingivae pos-
terior to the maxillary canine teeth, and the underlying bone of 
the palate.

Decay of the hard tissues of a tooth results in the formation 
of dental caries (cavities). Invasion of the pulp of the tooth by a 
carious lesion (cavity) results in infection and irritation of the tis-
sues in the pulp cavity. This condition causes an in ammatory pro-
cess (pulpitis). Because the pulp cavity is a rigid space, the swollen 
pulpal tissues cause pain (toothache).

Improper oral hygiene results in food deposits in tooth and 
gingival crevices, which may cause in ammation of the gingivae, 
gingivitis. If untreated, the disease spreads to other supporting 
structures (including the alveolar bone), producing periodontitis. 
Periodontitis results in in ammation of the gingivae and may result 
in absorption of alveolar bone and gingival recession. Gingival re-
cession exposes the sensitive cement of the teeth.

incisor, lateral incisor, canine, 1st molar (M1), and 2nd molar (M2). 
Primary teeth differ from permanent teeth in that the primary teeth 
are smaller and whiter; the molars also have more bulbous crowns 
and more divergent roots. B. Teeth in situ, younger than 2 years of 
age. Permanent teeth are colored orange; the crowns of the un-

Deformity of the external nose usually is present with a 
fracture, particularly when a lateral force is applied by some-
one’s elbow, for example. When the injury results from a direct 
blow (e.g., from a hockey stick), the cribriform plate of the eth-
moid bone may fracture, resulting in CSF rhinorrhea.

Epistaxis. On the anterior part of the nasal 
septum is an area rich in capillaries (Kiesselbach 
area) where all  ve arteries (sphenopalatine, an-
terior and posterior ethmoidal, greater palatine, 
and superior labial and lateral nasal branches 
of the facial artery) supplying the nasal septum 
anastomose. This area is often where profuse 
bleeding from the nose (epistaxis) occurs.

• The vestibule is superior to the nostril and anterior to the inferior

perior to the vestibule and anterior to the middle meatus.
• The inferior and middle conchae curve inferiorly and medially 
from the lateral wall, dividing it into three nearly equal parts 
and covering the inferior and middle meatuses, respectively. The 
middle concha ends inferior to the sphenoidal sinus, and the 
inferior concha ends inferior to the middle concha, just anterior 
to the ori ce of the auditory tube. The superior concha is small 
and anterior to the sphenoidal sinus.
• The roof comprises an anterior sloping part corresponding to the 
bridge of the nose; an intermediate horizontal part; a perpendicu-
lar part anterior to the sphenoidal sinus; and a curved part, inferior 
to the sinus, that is continuous with the roof of the nasopharynx.

Rhinitis. The nasal mucosa becomes swol-
len and in amed (rhinitis) during upper respira-
tory infections and allergic reactions (e.g., hay 
fever). Swelling of this mucous membrane 
occurs readily because of its vascularity and 
abundant mucosal glands. Infections of the 
nasal cavities may spread to the anterior cranial 
fossa through the cribriform plate, nasophar-
ynx and retropharyngeal soft tissues, middle 
ear through the pharyngotympanic (auditory) 
tube, paranasal sinuses, lacrimal apparatus, 
and conjunctiva.

If nasal drainage is blocked, infections of the ethmoidal cells of 
the ethmoidal sinuses may break through the fragile medial wall of the 
orbit. Severe infections from this source may cause blindness but could 
also affect the dural sheath of the optic nerve, causing optic neuritis.
During removal of a maxillary molar tooth, a fracture of a 
tooth root may occur. If proper retrieval methods are not used, a 
piece of the root may be driven superiorly into the maxillary sinus.
Radiographs/CT images of the frontal sinuses may be used 
for forensic identi cation of unknown individuals. The frontal 
sinuses are unique to each person, much like  ngerprints.

infected, as their ostia are small and located high on their su-
peromedial walls, a poor location for natural drainage of the 
sinus. When the mucous membrane of the sinus is congested, 
the maxillary openings (ostia) often are obstructed. The maxil-
lary sinusitis is treated with antibiotics; the sinus can also be 
cannulated and drained. For chronic maxillary sinusitis, sinu-
plasty or m axillary antrostom y are used to improve the drain-
age of the maxillary sinus by enlarging the opening of the ostia 
of one or more sinuses.

• The external ear comprises the auricle and external acoustic 
(auditory) meatus.
• The middle ear (tympanum) lies between the tympanic mem-
brane and internal ear. Three ossicles extend from the lateral 
to the medial walls of the tympanum. Of these, the malleus is 
attached to the tympanic membrane. The stapes is attached by 
the annular ligament to the oval window, and the incus con-
nects to the malleus and stapes. The pharyngotympanic tube, 
extending from the nasopharynx, opens into the anterior wall of 
the tympanic cavity.
•  The membranous labyrinth comprises a closed system of mem-
branous tubes and bulbs  lled with  uid, endolymph and 
bathed in surrounding  uid, called perilymph; both membra-
nous labyrinth and perilymph are contained within the bony 
labyrinth.

• The external acoustic meatus is about 3 cm long; half is carti-
laginous and half is bony. It is narrowest at the isthmus, near the 
junction of the cartilaginous and bony parts.
• The external acoustic meatus is innervated by the auriculotem-
poral branch of the mandibular nerve (CN V3) and the auricular 
branches of the vagus nerve (CN X); the middle ear is innervated 
by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).
• The cartilaginous part of the external acoustic meatus is lined 
with thick skin; the bony part is lined with thin skin that adheres 
to the periosteum and forms the outermost layer of the tym-

• The oval tympanic membrane is a shallow cone deepest at the 
central apex, the umbo, where the membrane is attached to the 
tip of the handle of the malleus. The handle of the malleus is 
attached to the membrane along its entire length as it extends 
anterosuperiorly toward the periphery of the membrane.
• Superior to the lateral process of the malleus, the membrane is 
thin (pars  accida); the  accid part lacks the radial and circular 
 bers present in the remainder of the membrane (pars tensa). 
The junction between the two parts is marked by anterior and 
posterior mallear folds.
•  The lateral surface of the tympanic membrane is innervated 
by the auricular branch of the auriculotemporal nerve (CN V3) 
and the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (CN X); the medial 
surface is innervated by tympanic branches of CN IX.
Examination of the external acoustic meatus and tympanic 
membrane begins by straightening the meatus. In adults, the 
helix is grasped and pulled posterosuperiorly (up, out, and back). 
These movements reduce the curvature of the external acoustic 
meatus, facilitating insertion of the otoscope. The external acoustic 
meatus is relatively short in infants; therefore, extra care must be 
taken to prevent damage to the tympanic membrane.

• The head of the malleus and body and short process of the incus 
lie in the epitympanic recess, and the handle of the malleus is 
embedded in the tympanic membrane.
• The saddle-shaped articular surface of the head of the malleus 
and the reciprocally shaped articular surface of the body of the 
incus form the incudomalleolar synovial joint.
• A convex articular facet at the end of the long process of the 
incus articulates with the head of the stapes to compose the 
incudostapedial synovial joint.
•  An earache and bulging red tympanic membrane may indicate 
pus or  uid in the middle ear, a sign of otitis m edia. Infec-
tion of the middle ear often is secondary to upper respiratory 
infections. In ammation and swelling of the mucous mem-
brane lining the tympanic cavity may cause partial or com-
plete blockage of the pharyngotympanic tube. The tympanic 
membrane becomes red and bulges and the person may com-
plain of “ear popping.” If untreated, otitis media may produce 
impaired hearing as the result of scarring of the auditory os-
sicles, limiting the ability of these bones to move in response 
to sound.

Walls of Tympanic Cavity
A. Schematic illustration of the tympanic cavity with the ante-
rior wall removed. B. Lateral wall of the tympanic cavity. The 
facial nerve lies within the facial canal surrounded by a tough 
periosteal tube; the chorda tympani leaves the facial nerve and 
lies within two crescentic folds of mucous membrane, cross-
ing the neck of the malleus superior to the tendon of tensor 
tympani.
Perforation of the tympanic membrane (ruptured eardrum) 
may result from otitis media. Perforation may also result from for-
eign bodies in the external acoustic meatus, trauma, or excessive 
pressure. Because the superior half of the tympanic membrane 
is much more vascular than the inferior half, incisions are made 
postero-inferiorly through the membrane. This incision also avoids 
injury to the chorda tympani nerve and auditory ossicles.

The tegmen tympani has been removed to expose the middle ear. In 
addition, the arcuate eminence has been removed to reveal the an-
terior semicircular canal, and the course of the facial and vestibuloco-
chlear nerves through the internal acoustic meatus and internal ear. 
At the geniculate ganglion, the facial nerve executes a sharp bend, 
called the genu, and then curves postero-inferiorly within the bony 
facial canal; the thin lateral wall of the facial canal separates the facial 
nerve from the tympanic cavity of the middle ear.

Infections of the mastoid antrum and mastoid cells 
(mastoiditis) result from middle ear infections that cause 
in ammation of the mastoid process. Infections may 
spread superiorly into the middle cranial fossa through 
the petrosquamous  ssure in children or may cause os-
teomyelitis (bone infection) of the tegmen tympani. 
Since the advent of antibiotics, mastoiditis is uncommon.

• The general direction of the pharyngotympanic tube is su-
perior, posterior, and lateral from the nasopharynx to the 
tympanic cavity.
• The cartilaginous part of the tube rests throughout its length 
on the levator veli palatini muscle.
• The line of the meatuses and the line of the airway, from na-
sopharynx to mastoid cells, intersect at the tympanic cavity.
• The tegmen tympani forms the roof of the tympanic cavity 
and mastoid antrum.
The function of the pharyngotympanic tube is equalizing 
pressure in the middle ear with the atmospheric pressure, 
thereby allowing free movement of the tympanic membrane. 
By allowing air to enter and leave the tympanic cavity, this tube 
balances the pressure on both sides of the membrane. Because 
the walls of the cartilaginous part of the tube are normally in ap-
position, the tube must be actively opened. The tube is opened 
by the expanding girth of the belly of the levator veli palatini as 
it contracts longitudinally, pushing against one wall while the 
tensor veli palatini pulls on the other. Because these are muscles 
of the soft palate, equalizing pressure (popping the eardrums) 
is commonly associated with activities such as yawning and 
swallowing.

A. Distribution of vestibulocochlear nerve (schematic). B. Structure 
of cochlea. The cochlea has been sectioned along the bony core of 
the cochlea (modiolus), the axis about which the cochlea winds. 
An isolated modiolus is shown after the turns of the cochlea are re-
moved, leaving only the spiral lamina winding around it. The large 
drawing shows the details of the area enclosed in the rectangle, 
including a cross section of the cochlear duct of the membranous 
labyrinth.
• The maculae of the membranous labyrinth are primarily static 
organs, which have small dense particles (otoliths) embedded 
among the hair cells. Under the in uence of gravity, the oto-
liths cause bending of the hair cells, which stimulate the ves-
tibular nerve and provide awareness of the position of the head 
in space; the hairs also respond to quick tilting movements and 
to linear acceleration and deceleration. Motion sickness results 
mainly from discordance between vestibular and visual stimuli.
•  Persistent exposure to excessively loud sound causes degenera-
tive changes in the spiral organ, resulting in high-tone deafness. 
This type of hearing loss commonly occurs in workers who are 
exposed to loud noises and do not wear protective earmuffs.

Deviation of nasal septum. The nasal septum is usually devi-
ated to one side or the other. This could be the result of a birth 
injury, but more often, the deviation occurs during adolescence 
and adulthood from trauma. Sometimes, the deviation is so severe 
that the nasal septum is in contact with the lateral wall of the nasal 
cavity and often obstructs breathing or exacerbates snoring. The 
deviation can be corrected surgically.

Cerebral contusion (bruising) results from brain trauma in 
which the pia is stripped from the injured surface of the brain and 
may be torn, allowing blood to enter the subarachnoid space. 
The bruising results from the sudden impact of the moving brain 
against the stationary cranium or from the suddenly moving cra-
nium against the stationary brain. Cerebral contusion may result in 
an extended loss of consciousness.

Cerebral compression may be produced by intracranial col-
lections of blood, obstruction of CSF circulation or absorption, 
intracranial tumors or abscesses, and brain swelling caused by 
brain edema, an increase in brain volume resulting from an in-
crease in water and sodium content.

• The ventricular system consists of two lateral ventricles located 
in the cerebral hemispheres, a 3rd ventricle located between the 
right and left halves of the diencephalon, and a 4th ventricle 
located in the posterior parts of the pons and medulla.
• CSF secreted by choroid plexus in the ventricles drains via the 
interventricular foramen from the lateral to the 3rd ventricle, via 
the cerebral aqueduct from the 3rd to the 4th ventricle, and via 
median and lateral apertures into the subarachnoid space. CSF 
is absorbed by arachnoid granulations into the venous sinuses 
(especially the superior sagittal sinus).
•  Hydrocephalus. Overproduction of CSF, obstruction of its  ow, 
or interference with its absorption results in an excess of CSF in 
the ventricles and enlargement of the head, a condition known 
as hydrocephalus. Excess CSF dilates the ventricles; thins the 
brain; and, in infants, separates the bones of the calvaria be-
cause the sutures and fontanelles are still open.

The dissections begin from the lateral surface of the cerebral hemi-
sphere (A) and proceed sequentially medially (B–F).
A. Sulci and gyri of the lateral surface of right cerebral hemi-
sphere. Each gyrus is a fold of cerebral cortex with a core of 
white matter. The furrows are called sulci. The pattern of sulci 
and gyri, formed shortly before birth, is recognizable in some 
adult brains, as shown in this specimen. Usually, the expanding 
cortex acquires secondary foldings, which make identi cation of 
this basic pattern more dif cult. B. Superior longitudinal fascicu-
lus, transverse temporal gyri, and insula. The cortex and short 
association  ber bundles around the lateral  ssure have been 
removed.

hemisphere.
A. Ventral aspect.
• The brainstem consists of the medulla oblongata, pons, and 
midbrain.
• The pyramid is on the ventral surface of the medulla; the decus-
sation of the pyramids is formed by the decussating (crossing) 
lateral corticospinal tract.
• The trigeminal nerve (CN V) emerges as sensory and motor 
roots.
•  The crus cerebri are part of the midbrain.
•  The oculomotor nerve emerges from the interpeduncular fossa.
B. Lateral aspect.
•  The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) consists of two nerves, the 
vestibular and cochlear nerves.
•  The spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve is exposed where it 
comes to the surface of the medulla to form the tuber cinereum.
•  The three are cerebellar peduncles: superior, middle, and 
inferior.
•  The medial and lateral lemnisci on the lateral aspect of the mid-
brain

A. Median section. The arachnoid mater was removed except 
where it covered the cerebellum and the occipital lobe. Cisternal 
puncture. CSF may be obtained, for diagnostic purposes, from 
the posterior cerebellomedullary cistern, using a procedure 
known as cisternal puncture. The subarachnoid space or the ven-
tricular system may also be entered for measuring or monitoring 
CSF pressure, injecting antibiotics, or administering contrast 
media for radiography. B. Superior view of the cerebellum. The 
right and left cerebellar hemispheres are united by the superior 
vermis; the anterior and posterior lobes are separated by the pri-
mary  ssure. C. Inferior view of cerebellum. The  occulonodular 
lobe, the oldest part of the cerebellum, consists of the  occulus 
and nodule; the cerebellar tonsils typically extend into the fora-
men magnum.

Increased intracranial pressure (e.g., due to a tumor) may 
cause displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen 
magnum, resulting in a foraminal (tonsillar) herniation. Com-
pression of the brainstem, if severe, may result in respiratory and 
cardiac arrest.

vein unites with the posterior auricular vein to form the exter-
nal jugular vein. The facial vein receives the anterior division 
of the retromandibular vein, forming the common facial vein 
that empties into the internal jugular vein. Variations are com-
mon. B. Surface anatomy of the external jugular vein and the 
muscles bounding the lateral cervical region (posterior triangle)

External jugular vein (EJV). The EJV may serve as an “inter-
nal barometer.” When venous pressure is in the normal range, 
the EJV is usually visible superior to the clavicle for only a short 
distance. However, when venous pressure rises (e.g., as in heart 
failure), the vein is prominent throughout its course along the 
side of the neck. Consequently, routine observation for disten-
tion of the EJVs during physical examinations may reveal diag-
nostic signs of heart failure, obstruction of the superior vena 
cava, enlarged supraclavicular lymph nodes, or increased intra-
thoracic pressure.

A. Surface anatomy. B. Tracheostomy. The U-shaped hyoid bone lies superior to the thyroid 
cartilage at the level of the C4 and C5 vertebrae. The laryngeal prominence is produced by the 
fused laminae of the thyroid cartilage, which meet in the median plane. The cricoid cartilage 
can be felt inferior to the laryngeal prominence. It lies at the level of the C6 vertebra. The carti-
laginous tracheal rings are palpable in the inferior part of the neck. The 2nd to 4th rings cannot 
be felt because the isthmus of the thyroid, connecting its right and left lobes, covers them. The 
1st tracheal ring is just superior to the isthmus.
Tracheostomy. A transverse incision through the skin of the neck and anterior wall of the 
trachea (tracheostomy) establishes an airway in patients with upper airway obstruction or respi-
ratory failure. The infrahyoid muscles are retracted laterally, and the isthmus of the thyroid gland 
is either divided or retracted superiorly. An opening is made in the trachea between the 1st and 
2nd tracheal rings or through the 2nd through 4th rings. A tracheostomy tube is then inserted 
into the trachea and secured. To avoid complications during a tracheostomy, the following ana-
tomical relationships are important:
• The inferior thyroid veins arise from a venous plexus on the thyroid gland and descend ante-
rior to the trachea (see Fig. 8.10).
• A small thyroid ima artery is present in approximately 10% of people; it ascends from the bra-
chiocephalic trunk or the arch of the aorta to the isthmus of the thyroid gland (see Fig. 8.21).
• The left brachiocephalic vein, jugular venous arch, and pleurae may be encountered, particu-
larly in infants and children.
• The thymus covers the inferior part of the trachea in infants and children.
• The trachea is small, mobile, and soft in infants, making it easy to cut through its posterior 
wall and damage the esophagus.
Cricothyrotomy. The incision is made through the cricothyroid membrane, and the tube 
inserted between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages.

C. Muscles forming the  oor of the lateral cervical region. The pre-
vertebral layer of deep cervical fascia has been partially removed, and 
the motor nerves and most of the  oor of the region are exposed.
• The phrenic nerve (C3, C4, C5) supplies the diaphragm and is 
located deep to the prevertebral layer of deep cervical fascia on 
the anterior surface of the anterior scalene muscle.
Severance of a phrenic nerve results in an ipsilateral paralysis 
of the diaphragm. A phrenic nerve block produces a short period 
of paralysis of the diaphragm on one side (e.g., for a lung opera-
tion). The anesthetic agent is injected around the nerve where it 
lies on the anterior surface of the anterior scalene muscle.
D. and E. Sensory nerves of cervical plexus. Branches arising 
from the nerve loop between the anterior rami of C2 and C3 are 
the lesser occipital, great auricular, and transverse cervical nerves. 
Branches arising from the loop formed between the anterior rami 
of C3 and C4 are the supraclavicular nerves, which emerge as a 
common trunk under cover of the SCM.
Regional anesthesia is often used for surgical procedures in the 
neck region or upper limb. In a cervical plexus block, an anes-
thetic agent is injected at several points along the posterior border 
of the SCM, mainly at its midpoint, the nerve point of the neck.

plexus and subclavian vessels.
• The anterior rami of C5–T1 form the brachial plexus; the ante-
rior ramus of T1 lies posterior to the subclavian artery.
• The brachial plexus and subclavian artery emerge between the 
middle and anterior scalene muscles.
• The anterior scalene muscle lies between the subclavian artery 
and vein.
The right or left subclavian vein is often the site of placement for 
a central venous catheter, used to insert intravenous tubes (“central 
venous lines”) for the administration of parenteral nutritional  uids or 
medications, for testing blood chemistry or central venous pressure, 
or inserting electrode wires for heart pacemaker devices. The rela-
tionships of the subclavian vein to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, 
clavicle, sternoclavicular joint, and 1st rib are of clinical importance 
in line placement, and there is danger of puncture of the pleura or 
subclavian artery if the procedure is not performed correctly.

• A persistent thymus projects superiorly from the thorax.
• The two super cial depressors of the larynx (“strap muscles”) 
are the omohyoid (only the superior belly of which is seen here) 
and sternohyoid.
Fracture of the hyoid. This results in depression of the body of 
the hyoid onto the thyroid cartilage. Inability to elevate the hyoid 
and move it anteriorly beneath the tongue makes swallowing and 
maintenance of the separation of the alimentary and respiratory 
tracts dif cult and may result in aspiration pneumonia.

739
The sternocleidomastoid muscle has been severed; the inferior 
portion re ected inferiorly and superior portion posteriorly.
• The intermediate tendon of the digastric muscle is connected to 
the hyoid bone by a fascial sling derived from the muscular part 
of the pretracheal layer of deep cervical fascia; the tendon of the 
omohyoid muscle is similarly tethered to the clavicle.
• In this specimen, the facial and lingual arteries arise from a com-
mon trunk and pass deep to the stylohyoid and digastric muscles.
•  The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) crosses the internal and external 
carotid arteries and gives off two branches, the superior root of 
the ansa cervicalis and the nerve to the thyrohyoid, before pass-
ing anteriorly deep to the mylohyoid muscle. In this specimen, 
the inferior root of the ansa cervicalis lies deep to the internal 
jugular vein and emerges at its medial aspect.

Origin
 
Course and Distribution
Right common carotid
Bifurcation of brachiocephalic trunk
Ascends in neck within carotid sheath with the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve (CN X). Terminates 
at superior border of thyroid cartilage (C4 vertebral level) by dividing into internal and external carotid 
arteries
Left common carotid
Arch of aorta
Right and left internal carotid
Right and left common carotid
No branches in the neck. Enters cranium via carotid canal to supply brain and orbits. Proximal part loca-
tion of carotid sinus, a baroreceptor that reacts to change in arterial blood pressure. The carotid body, a 
chemoreceptor that monitors oxygen level in blood, is located in bifurcation of common carotid
Right and left external carotid
Supplies most structures external to cranium; part of forehead, and scalp are supplied by ophthalmic 
artery from intracranial internal carotid artery
Ascending pharyngeal
External carotid
Ascends on pharynx to supply pharynx, prevertebral muscles, middle ear, and cranial meninges
Occipital
Passes posteriorly, medial and parallel to the posterior belly of digastric, ending in the posterior scalp
Posterior auricular
Ascends posteriorly between external acoustic meatus and mastoid process to supply adjacent muscles, 
parotid gland, facial nerve, auricle, and scalp

Runs antero-inferiorly deep to infrahyoid muscles to reach thyroid gland. Supplies thyroid gland, infrahy-
oid muscles, SCM, and larynx via superior laryngeal artery
Lingual
Lies on middle constrictor muscle of pharynx; arches supero-anteriorly and passes deep to CN XII, sty-
lohyoid muscle, and posterior belly of digastric then passes deep to hyoglossus, giving branches to the 
posterior tongue and bifurcating into deep lingual and sublingual arteries
Facial
After giving rise to ascending palatine artery and a tonsillar branch, it passes superiorly under cover of the 
angle of the mandible. It then loops anteriorly to supply the submandibular gland and give rise to the 
submental artery to the  oor of the mouth before entering the face
Maxillary
Terminal branches of external carotid
Passes posterior to neck of mandible, enters infratemporal fossa then pterygopalatine fossa to supply 
teeth, nose, ear, and face
Super cial temporal
Ascends anterior to auricle to temporal region and ends in scalp
Vertebral
Subclavian
Passes through the foramina transversaria of the transverse processes of vertebrae C1–C6, runs in a 
groove on the posterior arch of the atlas, and enters the cranial cavity through the foramen magnum
Internal thoracic
No branches in neck; enters thorax
Thyrocervical trunk
Has two branches: the inferior thyroid artery, the main visceral artery of the neck; the cervicodorsal trunk 
sending branches to the lateral cervical region, trapezius, and medial scapular arteries
Costocervical trunk
Trunk passes posterosuperiorly and divides into superior intercostal and deep cervical arteries to supply the 
1st and 2nd intercostal spaces and posterior deep cervical muscles, respectively

C–E. Variation in the origin of the lingual artery as studied by Dr. 
Grant in 211 specimens. In 80%, the superior thyroid, lingual, and 
facial arteries arose separately (C); in 20%, the lingual and facial 
arteries arose from a common stem inferiorly (D) or high on the 
external carotid artery (E). In one specimen, the superior thyroid 
and lingual arteries arose from a common stem.
Carotid occlusion, causing stenosis (narrowing), can be re-
lieved by opening the artery at its origin and stripping off the ath-
erosclerotic plaque with the artery’s lining (intima). This procedure 
is called carotid endarterectomy. Because of the relationships of 
the internal carotid artery, there is a risk of cranial nerve injury dur-
ing the procedure involving one or more of the following nerves: 
CN IX, CN X (or its branch, the superior laryngeal nerve), CN XI, 
or CN XII.

A. Overview. The internal jugular vein (IJV) begins at the jugu-
lar foramen as the continuation of the sigmoid sinus. From a 
dilated origin, the superior bulb of the IJV, the vein runs infe-
riorly through the neck in the carotid sheath. Posterior to the 
sternal end of the clavicle the vein merges perpendicularly with 
the subclavian vein, forming the “venous angle” that marks the 
origin of the brachiocephalic vein. The inferior end of the IJV 
dilates superior to its terminal valve, forming the inferior bulb 
of the IJV. The valve permits blood to  ow toward the heart 
while preventing back ow into the IJV. The external jugular vein 
drains blood from the occipital region and posterior neck to 
the subclavian vein, and the anterior jugular vein the anterior 
aspect of the neck.
B. Internal jugular vein puncture. A needle and catheter 
may be inserted into the IJV, using ultrasonic guidance, for di-
agnostic or therapeutic purposes. The right IJV is preferable to 
the left because it is usually larger and straighter. The clinician 
palpates the common carotid artery and inserts the needle into 
the IJV just lateral to it at a 30-degree angle, aiming at the apex 
of the triangle between the sternal and clavicular heads of the 
SCM. The needle is then directed inferolaterally toward the ip-
silateral nipple. Venous access can also be achieved by other 
supra- and infraclavicular approaches.

illustration of the venous drainage of the thyroid gland. Except for the superior 
thyroid veins, the thyroid veins are not paired with arteries of corresponding names.
The carotid pulse (neck pulse) is easily felt by palpating the common carotid 
artery in the side of the neck, where it lies in a groove between the trachea and the 
infrahyoid muscles. It is usually easily palpated just deep to the anterior border of 
the SCM at the level of the superior border of the thyroid cartilage. It is routinely 
checked during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Absence of a carotid pulse 
indicates cardiac arrest.

continues to run along the anterior border of the superior thyroid artery, 
passing deep to the superior attachment of the sternothyroid muscle, and 
then supplies the cricothyroid muscle. B. Blood supply of the parathyroid

A. Dissection of the left side of the root of the neck. The three structures con-
tained in the carotid sheath (internal jugular vein, common carotid artery, and 
vagus nerve) are retracted. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve ascends on the 
lateral aspect of the trachea, just anterior to the recess between the trachea 
and esophagus. B. Arterial supply of thyroid gland. The thyroid ima artery is 
infrequent (10%) and variable in its origin.
During a total thyroidectomy (e.g., excision of a malignant thyroid gland), 
the parathyroid glands are in danger of being inadvertently damaged or re-
moved. These glands are safe during subtotal thyroidectomy because the 
most posterior part of the thyroid gland usually is preserved. Variability in the 
position of the parathyroid glands, especially the inferior ones, puts them in 
danger of being removed during surgery on the thyroid gland. If the para-
thyroid glands are inadvertently removed during surgery, the patient suffers 
from tetany, a severe convulsive disorder. The generalized convulsive muscle 
spasms result from a fall in blood calcium levels.

A. Dissection of the right side of the root of the neck. The clavicle 
is cut, sections of the common carotid artery and internal jugular 
vein are removed, and the right lobe of the thyroid gland is re-
tracted. The right vagus nerve crosses the  rst part of the subcla-
vian artery and gives off an inferior cardiac branch and the right 
recurrent laryngeal nerve. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve 
loops inferior to the subclavian artery and passes posterior to the 
common carotid artery on its way to the posterolateral aspect of 
the trachea.
•  Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury may occur during thyroid-
ectomy and other surgeries in the anterior cervical region 
of the neck. Because the terminal branch of this nerve, the 
inferior laryngeal nerve, innervates the muscles moving the 
vocal folds, injury to the nerve results in paralysis of the vocal 
folds.
• A non-neoplastic and nonin ammatory enlargement of the thy-
roid gland, other than the variable enlargement that may occur 
during menstruation and pregnancy, is called a goiter. A goiter 
results from a lack of iodine. It is common in certain parts of the 
world where the soil and water are de cient in iodine and iodized 
salt is unavailable. The enlarged gland causes a swelling in the neck 
that may compress the trachea, esophagus, and recurrent laryn-
geal nerves. When the gland enlarges, it may do so anteriorly, pos-
teriorly, inferiorly, or laterally. It cannot move superiorly because 
of the superior attachments of the sternothyroid and sternohyoid 
muscles. Substernal extension of a goiter is also common.

mandibular triangle; the facial artery passes super cial to 
these muscles.
• The anterior belly of the digastric muscle forms the anterolat-
eral border of the submandibular triangle. In this specimen, 
the anterior belly has an additional origin from the hyoid. The 
mylohyoid muscle forms the  oor of the triangle and has a 
thick, free posterior border.
• The nerve to mylohyoid, which supplies the mylohyoid mus-
cle and anterior belly of the digastric muscle, is accompanied 
by the mylohyoid branch of the inferior alveolar artery posteri-
orly and the submental artery from the facial artery anteriorly.

• The pharynx is a unique portion of the alimentary tract, having a 
circular layer of muscle externally and a longitudinal layer internally.
• The circular layer of the pharynx consists of the three pharyn-
geal constrictor muscles (superior, middle, and inferior), which 
overlap one another.
• On the right side of the specimen, the stylopharyngeus muscle 
and glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) pass from the medial side 
of the styloid process anteromedially through the interval be-
tween the superior and middle pharyngeal constrictor muscles 
to become part of the internal longitudinal layer. The stylohyoid 
muscle passes from the lateral side of the styloid process antero-
laterally and splits on its way to the hyoid bone to accommodate 
passage of the intermediate tendon of the digastric.
•  Pharyngeal branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and 
the vagus nerve (CN X) form the pharyngeal plexus, which pro-
vides most of the pharyngeal innervation. The glossopharyngeal 
nerve supplies the sensory component, while the vagus supplies 
motor innervation.

aspect of the anterior wall of the pharynx. The pharynx consists of 
three continuous parts: (1) the nasal part (nasopharynx), superior 
to the level of the soft palate, communicates anteriorly through 
the choanae with the nasal cavities; (2) the oral part (oropharynx), 
between the soft palate and the epiglottis, communicates ante-
riorly through the isthmus of the fauces with the oral cavity; and 
(3) the laryngeal part (laryngopharynx), posterior to the larynx, 
communicates with the vestibule of the larynx through the inlet of 
(aditus to) the larynx. The pharynx extends from the cranial base 
to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage.

B. Illustration. The posterior wall of the pharynx has been split 
in the midline and re ected laterally as in (A) then, the mucous 
membrane was removed to expose the underlying muscula-
ture. The muscles of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx work 
together during swallowing, elevating the soft palate, narrowing 
the pharyngeal isthmus (passageway between the nasal and oral 
parts of the pharynx) and laryngeal inlet, retracting the epiglottis, 
and closing the glottis, to keep food and drink out of the naso-
pharynx and larynx as they pass from oral cavity to esophagus. At 
other times, as when blowing one’s nose, the palatopharyngeus 
muscles, partially encircling the opening to the oral cavity, con-
strict this opening and depress the soft palate, working with place-
ment and expansion of the posterior tongue to direct expired air 
through the nasal cavity.

• The fauces (throat), the passage from the mouth to the phar-
ynx, is bounded superiorly by the soft palate, inferiorly by the 
root (base) of the tongue, and laterally by the palatoglossal and 
palatopharyngeal arches (folds).
• The palatine tonsils are located between the palatoglossal and 
palatopharyngeal arches, formed by mucosa overlying the 
similarly named muscles; the arches form the boundaries, and the 
superior pharyngeal constrictor the  oor, of the tonsillar sinuses.
•  Normal palatine tonsils. In the adult, the palatine tonsils are 
normally involuted, with little glandular tissue in the tonsillar 
sinuses (B). In contrast in young children, the palatine tonsils 
are large relative to the adult, since most of the development of 
the lymphoid system occurs prior to puberty. Despite their large 
size, as long as the tonsils are not in amed and not interfering 
with swallowing/breathing they are considered normal.

of the tonsil and the fascial sheet covering the tonsillar fossa. Because 
of the rich blood supply of the tonsil, bleeding commonly arises from 
the large external palatine vein or less commonly from the tonsillar 
artery or other arterial twigs. The glossopharyngeal nerve accom-
panies the tonsillar artery on the lateral wall of the pharynx and is 
vulnerable to injury because this wall is thin. The internal carotid 
artery is especially vulnerable when it is tortuous, as it lies directly 
lateral to the tonsil.

• The superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle arises from (1) the pterygomandibular 
raphe, which unites it to the buccinator muscle; (2) the bones at each end of the 
raphe, the hamulus of the medial pterygoid plate superiorly and the mandible infe-
riorly; and (3) the root (posterior part) of the tongue.
• The middle pharyngeal constrictor muscle arises from the angle formed by the 
greater and lesser horns of the hyoid bone and from the stylohyoid ligament; in this 
specimen, the styloid process is long and, therefore, a lateral relation of the tonsil.
• The lingual nerve is joined by the chorda tympani, disappears at the posterior bor-
der of the medial pterygoid muscle, and reappears at the anterior border to follow 
the mandible.

• The larynx extends vertically from the tip of the epiglottis to the 
inferior border of the cricoid cartilage. The hyoid bone is gener-
ally not regarded as part of the larynx.
• The cricoid cartilage is the only cartilage that totally encircles the 
airway.
• The rima glottidis is the aperture between the vocal folds. Dur-
ing normal respiration, it is narrow and wedge-shaped; during 
forced respiration, it is wide. Variations in the tension and length 
of the vocal folds, in the width of the rima glottidis, and in the 
intensity of the expiratory effort produce changes in the pitch of 
the voice.
•  Laryngeal fractures may result from blows received in sports 
such as kickboxing and hockey or from compression by a shoul-
der strap during an automobile accident. Laryngeal fractures 
produce submucous hemorrhage and edema, respiratory ob-
struction, hoarseness, and sometimes a temporary inability to 
speak. The thyroid, cricoid, and most of the arytenoid cartilages 
often ossify as age advances, commencing at approximately 
25 years of age in the thyroid cartilage.

• The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve innervates the 
mucous membrane superior to the vocal folds, and the external 
laryngeal branch supplies the inferior pharyngeal constrictor and 
cricothyroid muscles.
• The recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies the esophagus, trachea, 
and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle. It supplies sensory in-
nervation inferior to the vocal folds and motor innervation to the 
intrinsic muscles of the larynx, except the cricothyroid.
B. Laryngocele. A laryngocele (enlarged laryngeal saccule) projects 
through the thyrohyoid membrane and communicates with the lar-
ynx through the ventricle. This air sac can form a bulge in the neck, 
especially on coughing. The inferior laryngeal nerves are vulnerable 
to injury during operations in the anterior triangles of the neck. In-
jury of the inferior laryngeal nerve results in paralysis of the vocal 
fold. The voice is initially poor because the paralyzed fold cannot ad-
duct to meet the normal vocal fold. In a bilateral paralysis, the voice 
is almost absent. Injury to the external branch of the superior 
laryngeal nerve results in a voice that is monotonous in character 
because the cricothyroid muscle is unable to vary the tension of 
the vocal fold. Hoarseness is the most common symptom of serious 
disorders of the larynx.

A. The posterior wall of the larynx is split in the me-
dian plane (see Fig. 8.34A), and the two sides held 
apart. On the left side of the specimen, the mucous 
membrane is intact; on the right side, the mucous 
and submucous coats are peeled off revealing the 
cartilages, ligaments, and  bro-elastic membrane. B. 
Interior of the larynx superior to the vocal folds. The 
larynx is sectioned near the median plane to reveal 
the interior of its left side. Inferior to this level, the 
right side of the intact larynx is dissected.
• The three compartments of the larynx are (1) the 
superior compartment of the vestibule, superior to 
the level of the vestibular folds (false cords); (2) the 
middle, between the levels of the vestibular and 
vocal folds; and (3) the inferior, or infraglottic, cav-
ity, inferior to the level of the vocal folds.
• The quadrangular membrane underlies the ary-
epiglottic fold superiorly and is thickened inferiorly 
to form the vestibular ligament. The cricothyroid 
ligament (conus elasticus) begins inferiorly as the 
strong median cricothyroid ligament and is thick-
ened superiorly as the vocal ligament. The lateral 
recess between the vocal and vestibular ligaments 
is the ventricle.

The intrinsic laryngeal muscles move the laryngeal cartilages, 
making alterations in the length and tension of the vocal folds 
and in the size and shape of the rima glottidis. All but one of the 
intrinsic muscles of the larynx is supplied by the recurrent laryngeal 
nerve (CN X). The cricothyroid muscle (A and B) is supplied by 
the external laryngeal nerve, one of the two terminal branches of 
the superior laryngeal nerve.

A. Laryngoscopic examination. Laryngoscopy is the procedure used 
to examine the interior of the larynx. The larynx may be examined 
visually by indirect laryngoscopy using a laryngeal mirror or it may be 
viewed by direct laryngoscopy using a tubular and endoscopic instru-
ment, a laryngoscope. The vestibular and vocal folds can be observed. 
B. Vocal folds and rima glottidis. The inlet, or aditus, to the larynx 
is bounded anteriorly by the epiglottis; posteriorly by the aryte-
noid cartilages, the corniculate cartilages that cap them, and the 
interarytenoid fold that unites them; and on each side by the ary-
epiglottic fold, which contains the superior end of the cuneiform 
cartilage. The vocal apparatus of the larynx, the glottis, includes 
the vocal folds, vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages, and the 
rima glottidis, the aperture between the vocal folds. C. Coronal 
MRI. D. Coronal section. Numbers in parentheses on diagram refer 
to numbered structures on MRI.
A foreign body such as a piece of steak, may accidentally as-
pirate through the laryngeal inlet into the vestibule of the larynx, 
where it becomes trapped superior to the vestibular folds. When 
a foreign body enters the vestibule, the laryngeal muscles go into 
spasm, tensing the vocal folds. The rima glottidis closes and no air 
enters the trachea. Asphyxiation occurs, and the person will die in 
approximately 5 minutes from lack of oxygen if the obstruction is 
not removed. Emergency therapy must be given to open the air-
way. The procedure used depends on the condition of the patient, 
the facilities available, and the experience of the person giving  rst 
aid. Because the lungs still contain air, sudden compression of the 
abdomen (Heimlich maneuver) causes the diaphragm to elevate 
and compress the lungs, expelling air from the trachea into the 
larynx. This maneuver may dislodge the food or other material 
from the larynx.

Radical neck dissections are performed when cancer invades the 
lymphatics. During the procedure, the deep cervical lymph nodes 
and the tissues around them are removed as completely as pos-
sible. Although major arteries, the brachial plexus, CN X, and the 
phrenic nerve are preserved, most cutaneous branches of the cer-
vical plexus are removed. The aim of the dissection is to remove all 
tissue that contains lymph nodes in one piece.

SYMPATHETIC TRUNK AND SYMPATHETIC 
PERI-ARTERIAL PLEXUS
A lesion of a sympathetic trunk in the neck results in a sympa-
thetic disturbance called Horner syndrome, which is character-
ized by the following:
• Pupillary constriction resulting from paralysis of the dilator 
pupillae muscle.
• Ptosis (drooping of the superior eyelid), resulting from paral-
ysis of the smooth (tarsal) muscle intermingled with striated 
muscle of the levator palpebrae superioris.
• Sinking in of the eyeball (enophthalmos), possibly caused by 
paralysis of smooth (orbitalis) muscle in the  oor of the orbit.
• Vasodilation and absence of sweating on the face and neck 
(anhydrosis), caused by a lack of sympathetic (vasoconstric-
tive) nerve supply to the blood vessels and sweat glands.

• Stage 2: Involuntary and rapid; the soft palate is elevated, sealing 
off the nasopharynx from the oropharynx and laryngopharynx. 
The pharynx widens and shortens to receive the bolus of food 
as the suprahyoid and longitudinal pharyngeal muscles contract, 
elevating the larynx.
•  Stage 3: Involuntary; sequential contraction of all three pharyn-
geal constrictor muscles forces the food bolus inferiorly into the 
esophagus.

SECTIONAL ANATOMY AND IMAGING OF NECK
Ultrasonog raphy is a useful diagnostic imaging technique for 
studying soft tissues of the neck. Ultrasound (US) provides images 
of many abnormal conditions noninvasively, at relatively low cost, 
and with minimal discomfort. US is useful for distinguishing solid 
from cystic masses, for example, which may be dif cult to deter-
mine during physical examination. Vascular imaging of arteries 
and veins of the neck is possible using intravascular US. The im-
ages are produced by placing the transducer over the blood vessel. 
Doppler ultrasound techniques help evaluate blood  ow through a 
vessel (e.g., for detecting stenosis [narrowing] of a carotid artery).

Cranial nerves are nerves that exit from the cranial cavity through 
openings in the cranium. There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves that 
are named and numbered in rostrocaudal sequence of their super-
 cial origins from the brain, brainstem, and superior spinal cord. 
The olfactory nerves (CN I, not shown) end in the olfactory bulb. 
The entire origin of the spinal accessory nerve (CN XI) from the 
spinal cord is not included here; it extends inferiorly as far as the 
C6 spinal cord segment.

The venous sinuses have been opened on the right side. The oph-
thalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V1) and the troch-
lear (CN IV) and oculomotor (CN III) nerves have been dissected 
from the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. Although there are 
no sympathetic  bers in cranial nerves as they leave the brain, 
postsynaptic sympathetic nerve  bers “hitch-hike” onto branches 
of cranial nerves having traveled to the region via major blood 
vessels.

The  bers of the cranial nerves are connected to nuclei (groups of 
nerve cell bodies in the central nervous system), in which afferent 
(sensory)  bers terminate and from which efferent (motor)  bers 
originate. Nuclei of common functional types (motor, sensory, 
parasympathetic, and special sensory nuclei) have a generally co-
lumnar placement within the brainstem, with the sulcus limitans 
demarcating motor and sensory columns.
Somatic motor: Motor  bers innervating voluntary (striated 
muscle). For the muscles derived from the embryonic pharyngeal 
arches, their somatic motor innervation can be referred to more 
speci cally as branchial motor.

• The roof of the cochlear duct is formed by the vestibular mem-
brane and the  oor by the basilar membrane and osseous spiral 
lamina.
•  The receptor of auditory stimuli is the spiral organ (of Corti), 
situated on the basilar membrane; it is overlaid by the gelatinous 
tectorial membrane.
•  The spiral organ contains hair cells that respond to vibrations 
induced in the perilymph by sound waves.
•  The  bers of the cochlear nerve are axons of neurons of the spi-
ral ganglion; the peripheral processes enter the spiral organ (of 
Corti).

SUMMARY OF AUTONOMIC INNERVATION OF HEAD
Ganglion
Location
Parasympathetic Root (Nucleus of 
Origin)a
Sympathetic Root
Main Distribution
Ciliary
Between optic nerve and lateral 
rectus, close to apex of orbit
Inferior branch of oculomotor nerve 
(CN III) (Edinger-Westphal nucleus)
Branch from internal carotid 
plexus in cavernous sinus
Parasympathetic postsynaptic  bers from ciliary 
ganglion pass to ciliary muscle and sphincter, pu-
pillae of iris; sympathetic postsynaptic  bers from 
superior cervical ganglion pass to dilator pupillae 
and blood vessels of eye
Pterygopalatine  In pterygopalatine fossa, where 
it is attached by pterygopalatine 
branches of maxillary nerve; 
located immediately anterior to 
opening of pterygoid canal and 
inferior to CN V2
Greater petrosal nerve from facial 
nerve (CN VII) (superior salivatory 
nucleus)
Deep petrosal nerve, a branch of 
internal carotid plexus that is con-
tinuation of postsynaptic  bers of 
cervical sympathetic trunk;  bers 
from superior cervical ganglion 
pass through pterygopalatine gan-
glion and enter branches of CN V2
Parasympathetic postsynaptic  bers from ptery-
gopalatine ganglion innervate lacrimal gland 
through zygomatic branch of CN V2; sympa-
thetic postsynaptic  bers from superior cervical 
ganglion accompany branches of pterygopala-
tine nerve that are distributed to the nasal cavity, 
palate, and superior parts of the pharynx
Otic
Between tensor veli palatini and 
mandibular nerve; lies inferior to 
foramen ovale
Tympanic nerve from glossopha-
ryngeal nerve (CN IX); tympanic 
nerve continues from tympanic 
plexus as lesser petrosal nerve (infe-
rior salivatory nucleus)
Fibers from superior cervical gan-
glion travel via plexus on middle 
meningeal artery
Parasympathetic postsynaptic  bers from 
otic ganglion are distributed to parotid gland 
through auriculotemporal nerve (branch of CN 
V3); sympathetic postsynaptic  bers from supe-
rior cervical ganglion pass to parotid gland and 
supply its blood vessels
Submandibular
Suspended from lingual nerve by 
two short roots; lies on surface 
of hyoglossus muscle inferior to 
submandibular duct
Parasympathetic  bers join facial 
nerve (CN VII) and leave it in its 
chorda tympani branch, which 
unites with lingual nerve (superior 
salivatory nucleus)
Sympathetic  bers from superior 
cervical ganglion travel via the 
plexus on facial artery
Postsynaptic parasympathetic  bers from sub-
mandibular ganglion are distributed to the sub-
lingual and submandibular glands; sympathetic 
 bers supply sublingual and submandibular 
glands and appear to be secretomotor

sinus; aneurysms
Dilated pupil, ptosis, eye rotates inferiorly and laterally (down and out), pupillary re ex on the side 
of the lesion will be lost (A)
CN IV
Stretching of nerve during its course around brainstem; fracture of orbit  Inability to rotate adducted eye inferiorly
CN V
 
Injury to terminal branches (particularly CN V2) in roof of maxillary 
sinus; pathologic processes (tumors, aneurysms, infections) affecting 
trigeminal nerve
Loss of pain and touch sensations/paresthesia on face; loss of corneal re ex (blinking when cornea 
touched); paralysis of muscles of mastication; deviation of mandible to side of lesion when mouth 
is opened
CN VI
Base of brain or fracture involving cavernous sinus or orbit
 
Inability to rotate eye laterally; diplopia on lateral gaze (B)
CN VII
Laceration or contusion in parotid region
Paralysis of facial muscles; eye remains open; angle of mouth droops; forehead does not wrinkle (C)
Fracture of temporal bone
As above, plus associated involvement of cochlear nerve and chorda tympani; dry cornea and loss 
of taste on anterior two thirds of tongue
Intracranial hematoma (“stroke”)
Weakness (paralysis) of lower facial muscles contralateral to the lesion, upper facial muscles are not 
affected because they are bilaterally innervated
CN VIII
Tumor of nerve
Progressive unilateral hearing loss; tinnitus (noises in ear); vertigo (loss of balance)
CN IXa
Brainstem lesion or deep laceration of neck
Loss of taste on posterior third of tongue; loss of sensation on affected side of soft palate; loss of 
gag re ex on affected side
CN X
Brainstem lesion or deep laceration of neck
Sagging of soft palate; deviation of uvula to unaffected side; hoarseness owing to paralysis of vocal 
fold; dif culty in swallowing and speaking
CN XI
Laceration of neck
Paralysis of sternocleidomastoid and superior  bers of trapezius; drooping of shoulder (D)
CN XII
Neck laceration; basal skull fractures
Protruded tongue deviates toward affected side; moderate dysarthria, disturbance of articulation (E)
