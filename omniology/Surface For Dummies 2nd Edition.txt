Introduction
W

elcome to Surface For Dummies, 2nd Edition! This book helps you 
wring the most out of Microsoft’s Surface, the combination work/­
pleasure tablets that turn heads in coffee shops, classrooms, and lunch 
rooms.
This book doesn’t explain everything you can do with the Surface. That would 
take at least ten volumes. No, this book explains everything you need to know 
to set up your Surface, introduce it to yourself and your social networks, and 
transform it into a natural extension of your lifestyle and work routine.
This book covers all four Surface models: the original Surface RT and Surface 
Pro, and the newer Surface 2 and the Surface Pro 2 models. It also covers 
more Official Surface Accessories than anybody could possibly afford.
About This Book
Today, most people think of desktop PCs as workhorses for creating: They 
create documents, spreadsheets, and whatever other boring files their boss 
requires. And they usually require a mouse and keyboard.
Tablets, by contrast, work best at letting you consume: videos, music, the 
Internet, and e-mail. And you often do it on the couch by using your fingertips.
But what if one tablet straddled both worlds, letting you both consume and 
create?
That’s the promise of a Surface tablet. Its finger-friendly Start screen lets you 
watch videos, listen to music, read e-books and e-mail, and browse the web. 
And, come Monday morning, you can switch to the Windows desktop, click 
on one of the Surface’s many keyboards, and put on your working cap.
How well does it hold up on that promise? That’s where this book comes into 
play. I describe how it works in both work and play mode, as well as how to 
give it a few little tweaks to make it fit into your life a little more easily.

 Microsoft Surface For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
How to Use This Book
Instead of bundling a user manual with the Surface, Microsoft tossed in 
a single strip of paper with Ikea-like diagrams of how to fold down your 
Surface’s kickstand. That’s it.
This book takes over from that ignoble start by explaining exactly what you 
can and can’t do with your Surface. And when it points out things you can’t 
do, it offers some workarounds for going ahead and doing them anyway.
The book comes separated into basic parts, each dealing with what you need 
to do with your Surface at certain times: setting it up, connecting it to things, 
letting it entertain you, and buckling it down when work beckons.
Jump to the section you need at that particular moment in your life, absorb 
what you need to know, and move on. There’s no need to read the entire thing 
from cover to cover. Everything is presented in easily digestible nuggets.
Each of this book’s step-by-step instructions works with a strategically 
placed tap on your Surface’s touchscreen. On those rare occasions when you 
need to type information on a keyboard, you see easy-to-follow bold text like 
in this sentence: Type Sarcophagus into the Search box.
If you’re reading this book as an e-book, you’ll find that all the websites are 
listed as active links, ready to direct you to the page with a tap of your finger.
Foolish Assumptions
Because you’ve purchased this book, I’m making one logical assumption 
about you: You’ve bought a Microsoft Surface tablet, or you’re thinking about 
buying one.
So, you should know that everything in this book covers all four models of 
Microsoft’s Surface tablet:
	
✓	The original Surface RT and the Surface Pro: After you’ve taken advan­
tage of their free upgrade to Windows 8.1, all the instructions in this 
book apply to them.
	
✓	The new Surface 2 and the Surface Pro 2: These two new models come 
with Windows 8.1 installed.
This book describes how the four models differ, and I place a special icon 
next to material that applies only to the Surface RT and Surface 2.
If you haven’t yet purchased a Surface, this book helps you understand how 
the models differ and which model works best in which situations.

 Introduction
I also cover the Surface’s famous click-on Touch and Type Cover keyboards, 
as well as their replacements, the new Touch Cover 2 and Type Cover 2 key­
boards. Because they’re functionally the same, I refer to them both as simply 
Touch and Type Cover keyboards.
Icons Used in This Book
This book includes five basic icons, little symbols placed next to paragraphs 
of particular import. Here’s what to expect when you see any of these icons:
	
Keep an eye out for this icon, which alerts you to time-saving tricks that imme­
diately leapfrog you ahead of other Surface owners.
	
Avert your eyes from paragraphs marked with this icon if technical informa­
tion isn’t your thing — the text contains details that appeal to only a few nerdy 
souls.
	
Remember these few key tidbits, and you’ll pick up things much more quickly.
	
Tread carefully with the steps in this paragraph. The information may lead to 
serious problems if things go wrong.
	
The Surface 2 and the Surface RT (when upgraded) run Windows 8.1 RT. That 
means they differ from the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 in some fundamental 
ways. This icon calls out information that explains those differences.
Beyond This Book
The Microsoft Surface has so many cool features that I couldn’t fit them all 
into this book. You can find additional content at the following places:
	
✓	Cheat sheet: Here you can find information on how to keep your Surface 
updated so that it runs smoothly, how to work with apps (what those in 
tablet-land call programs) and keep them updated, and how to use the 
Charm bar (if you’re unfamiliar with this feature introduced in Windows 8).

✓	Extras: Visit here for step-by-step tutorials on how to play songs directly 
from a flash drive, as well as how to drop websites onto the Reading List 
app for later reading at your leisure.

Where to Go from Here
New Surface owners should definitely start with a read-through of the first 
four chapters, with a special emphasis on Chapter 3. The walkthrough steps 
in there apply not only to you but to everybody with an account on your 
Surface.
If you don’t have an attached keyboard, spend some time with Chapter 5; 
that chapter explains the subtleties of your Surface’s built-in keyboard, which 
pops up when no other keyboard is attached.
Gadget hounds should jump to Part II to see exactly what will and won’t work 
with their particular Surface models, as well as how to set up their apps and 
social networks.
After that, jump to your choice: the Play (Chapters 10 and 11) or Work 
(Chapters 12 through 14) part of the book.
If you’re reading this as an e-book, use your reader’s Bookmark and Search 
features to find what you want.
And with that, enjoy your Surface! It’s a bold move by Microsoft that heralds 
the future of Windows, and you’re at the forefront.

any people stay tied to a desktop PC at work. They sit in front of a 
deskbound workhorse that lets them create documents, spreadsheets, 
and whatever other humdrum files their boss requires that day.
When it’s time to relax, however, many of those same people reach for a 
tablet. Lightweight and portable, tablets make it easy to watch videos, listen 
to music, browse the web, and check e-mail.
But what if you had a tablet that did it all? You could create files when work 
called but consume files during your leisure.
That’s the promise of a Microsoft Surface tablet. Its finger-friendly Start 
screen lets you switch between videos, music, e-books, e-mail, and the web. 
And, come Monday morning, you can switch to the Windows desktop, fire up 
Outlook, Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, and get to work.
This chapter explains Microsoft’s four models of Surface tablets: The two 
older models, Surface RT and Surface Pro, and the two new models, Surface 2 
and Surface Pro 2. I describe them each in detail, highlighting their features, 
their strengths, and their weaknesses.

Part I: Introductions 
Why Buy a Microsoft Surface?
Most computer manufacturers create computers, including Windows tablets, 
as cheaply as possible. By coming up with the lowest price tag, they hope to 
undercut their competitors. Instead of taking the same road to the bottom, 
Microsoft created its line of Surface tablets as a showpiece, designed to show 
off Windows tablets at their finest.
To do that, Microsoft designed the Surface in-house with a large budget and 
engineering team, a luxury not available to most computer manufacturers.
Competitors cut costs by wrapping their tablets in cheap plastic. Microsoft 
Surface models, by contrast, come sheathed in a magnesium alloy. The 
rugged but lightweight casing gives the tablet a solid feel.
The Surface includes a built-in kickstand, shown in Figure 1-1. An optional 
attachable keyboard doubles as a cover when not in use.
Figure 1-1: 
Every 
Surface 
model 
includes a 
kickstand to 
prop it up at 
a comfort-
able viewing 
angle.

Why not just buy an iPad? Well, they’re attractive tablets that excel at what 
they do, but they’re limited. Without a built-in USB port, iPads don’t let you 
transfer files easily between your tablet and desktop PC. Every Surface tablet, 
by contrast, includes a full-sized USB port, making it easy to swap files through 
flash drives or even portable hard drives.

 Chapter 1: Which Microsoft Surface Do You Need?
When iPad owners need to work, they usually reach for their laptop. Surface 
owners simply flip their keyboard into place, load the familiar Windows desk­
top, and head for the mainstays of Microsoft Office: Word, PowerPoint, Excel, 
and OneNote.
When you’re ready to hit the road again, flip back the keyboard and run, 
taking all of your files with you.
Your Surface strips computing down to its essentials, creating a lightweight 
and mobile workstation that lets you add on accessories when necessary:
	
✓	Fingers: Your fingertips may be the only accessory you need. Touchscreens 
simplify many mobile computing tasks. It’s easy to scroll through large 
documents with a flick of your finger, for example. Plus, touchscreens 
often seem more natural, especially when paging through digital books, 
maneuvering through maps, or resizing digital photos.
	
✓	Keyboard: A pop-up touchscreen keyboard works well for light typing. 
For heavier work, the optional keyboards add about a half-pound of 
weight and double as screen covers.
	
✓	Monitor: When you plug a monitor into your tablet’s video port, you’ve 
created a two-monitor workstation. You can view your notes on your 
tablet but compose your document on the second, larger monitor. (I 
explain how to manage two monitors in Chapter 6.) Or, you can extend 
your Windows desktop across both monitors, doubling its size.
Understanding the Unique 
Features of a Surface
Microsoft Surface tablets introduce several features not found in other tablets:
	
✓	Kickstand: Place a tablet on the desk, and its screen faces the ceiling, 
not you. To solve the problem, each Surface includes a built-in kickstand 
that lets your tablet sit upright like a laptop’s screen. The kickstand on 
the newest models, the Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2, adjusts to provide 
two viewing angles, handy for typing in different situations.
	
✓	Keyboard cover: Most tablets don’t include a case or a keyboard. You 
can buy them as accessories, but they’re two more items to carry around. 
The Surface, by contrast, offers a keyboard that doubles as a cover. When 
you’re done working, flip up the keyboard, and it becomes a cover to pro­
tect the screen.
www.it-ebooks.info

10
Part I: Introductions 
	
✓	USB port/memory card slot: These items come built into every Surface 
tablet, but you won’t find them on any iPad. Ask any iPad owners how 
they move information to and from their iPad. Most of them get an uncom­
fortable expression on their faces while explaining their workarounds.
	
✓	Windows desktop: Nearly everybody has grown fairly used to the 
Windows desktop, a staple around offices for two decades. All Surfaces 
include the Windows desktop, but with one caveat: You can’t install tra­
ditional desktop programs on the Surface RT or Surface 2.
	
✓	Microsoft Office: The Surface RT and Surface 2 include a copy of 
Office Home and Student 2013 RT. That gives you Outlook, Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, and OneNote, ready to create your own documents or 
touch up those that arrive in e-mail. (Microsoft Office isn’t included on a 
Surface Pro or Surface Pro 2, but you can purchase and install it yourself 
if you want.)
Deciding between the Microsoft 
Surface Tablets
Microsoft has sold four types of Surface tablets that look and behave very 
similarly. (A fifth Surface, available sometime in 2014, will have cellular 
Internet access.) All of them share many features:
	
✓	The tile-filled Start screen introduced in Windows 8
	
✓	The Windows desktop
	
✓	Downloadable apps from the Windows Store
	
✓	A USB port and memory card slot for adding storage
	
✓	The ability to create different accounts for different users
Yet the tablets differ in subtle ways that let them each serve different niches.
The following sections explain how the models differ so that you can figure 
out which Surface meets your needs.
	
Not sure which Surface you’re looking at? Look for this chapter’s “Identifying a 
Surface Model” section. It explains how to tell each model apart simply by 
­flipping it over and reading the wording hidden on the back cover.
Note: I describe the first two Surface models, the Surface RT and Surface Pro, 
in the adjacent sidebar, “Upgrading first-generation Surfaces to Windows 8.1.”

 Chapter 1: Which Microsoft Surface Do You Need?
Surface 2
The Surface 2 works best during your leisure time, letting you watch movies, 
listen to music, browse the web, and connect with your friends.
Should you need to work, open the Desktop app. There, the built-in Microsoft 
Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote apps should carry you 
through until you can get back to the office.
	
The minimalist Surface 2 doesn’t run Windows 8.1 but an operating system 
called Windows RT 8.1. In plain English, that means that the Surface 2 can’t 
run traditional Windows desktop programs. Like the iPad, it’s limited to apps, 
small programs downloaded from the Windows Store.
Although it can’t run traditional Windows programs, the Surface 2 offers 
these perks:
	
✓	Low price: The Surface 2 comes in a 32GB version that costs $429; 
adding a Touch Cover keyboard adds another $79. (The newer Surface 
keyboards cost more, and I describe the differences between all of the 
Surface keyboards in Chapter 5.)
	
✓	Long battery life: Depending on its use, the Surface 2 averages between 
eight and ten hours of battery life.
Upgrading first-generation 
Surfaces to Windows 8.1
Microsoft’s first two Surface models, the 
Surface RT and the Surface Pro, didn’t fare 
well in the market. The Surface RT boasted a 
long battery life but ran at a fairly sluggish pace. 
The Surface Pro was speedy and powerful but 
lacked a long battery life. And Windows 8 was 
too new to gather much enthusiasm.
Microsoft replaced the two older Surface 
models with the much more capable Surface 2 
and Surface Pro 2.
If you own the Surface RT or Surface Pro, by 
all means, take advantage of Microsoft’s free 
upgrade to Windows 8.1. To upgrade, visit the 
Store app with your Surface (as explained in 
Chapter 7), search for Windows 8.1, and choose 
to download and install the upgrade.
After you upgrade your Surface RT or Surface 
Pro to Windows 8.1, nearly all of the instruc­
tions in this book will also apply to your older 
Surface. (The older tablets just run more 
slowly or with less battery life.) If you own a 
Surface RT, look throughout this book for the 
Windows RT icon. That icon points out where 
the Surface RT and Surface 2 work differently 
than the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2.
Microsoft no longer sells the Surface Pro, and 
Microsoft’s website now refers to the original 
Surface RT as simply “Surface.” You might 
find the “Surface” still available on Microsoft’s 
website or at some stores for an exceptionally 
low price.
www.it-ebooks.info

12
Part I: Introductions 
	
✓	Thin and light: The Surface 2 weighs less than 1.5 pounds and is 8.9mm 
thin. That makes it easy to toss into a backpack or keep by the bedside 
table.
	
✓	Better camera: The Surface 2 sports a 3.5-megapixel camera in front 
and a 5-megapixel camera in back. (The Surface RT also includes that 
camera, but the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 include only 1.2-megapixel 
cameras for the front and back.)
	
✓	USB 3.0 support: The Surface 2 works well with natively recognized USB 
gadgets. That means you can plug in storage devices (flash drives, por­
table drives), USB hubs with more USB ports, mice, keyboards, cameras, 
some headsets, and some USB printers. Because it uses the new USB 3.0 
standard, your information transfers much more quickly with USB 3.0 
gadgets.
	
✓	Bluetooth support: Nearly anything that connects wirelessly through 
Bluetooth works well with the Surface RT and Surface 2. Your wireless 
headsets, mice, keyboards, and other Bluetooth gadgets should work 
without a hitch.
	
✓	Memory card slot: To add storage, slide a memory card into the built-in 
microSDXC slot. That slot works with microSD, microSDHC, or microSDXC 
cards, which let you add up to 128GB storage space.
	
✓	Microsoft Office RT: The Surface RT and Surface 2 include Microsoft 
Office RT, a suite of programs including Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, 
Excel, and OneNote. That’s one less thing to buy to stay productive.
	
✓	OneDrive: Your Microsoft account gives you 7GB of free storage on 
OneDrive, an online cubby hole for files. (OneDrive was called SkyDrive 
until early 2014, when Microsoft changed its name.) The Surface 2 con­
tains a certificate to increase your OneDrive storage to a whopping 
200GB, free for two years.
	
✓	Apps: The Surface 2 can run only apps downloaded from the Windows 
Store. The Store doesn’t have as many apps as Apple and Google offer, 
but the stock grows larger every day.
	
The Surface 2 differs from the Surface Pro 2 version in many subtle ways too 
numerous to mention here. If you own a Surface 2 or Surface RT, keep an eye 
open for this Windows RT icon, like the one in the margin. Paragraphs with 
this icon explain other ways Windows RT differs from traditional Windows.
Surface Pro 2
Whereas the Surface 2 aims to meet the consumer’s needs, the Surface Pro 2 
gives you the power of a desktop PC in a rugged tablet. You could say that it’s 
two computers in one. On one hand, you have the Start screen apps for casual, 
on-the-go computing and staying connected while traveling.

 Chapter 1: Which Microsoft Surface Do You Need?
And, when work calls, you can load the full-powered Windows 8.1 Desktop 
app to run the same Windows programs you run on your desktop PC.
Windows 8.1 Pro also lets you pony up an extra $15 for the Windows Media 
Center Pack. This pack lets you play DVDs if you plug in a USB DVD drive. 
Plug in a TV tuner, connect a TV signal from cable or an antenna, and you’ve 
turned the Surface into a complete digital video recorder, ready to record TV 
shows for watching later.
The Surface Pro 2 comes with all the perks given to Surface 2 owners, includ­
ing the 200GB of free OneDrive storage for a year.
What can’t the Surface 2 handle?
Because the Surface 2 runs Windows 8.1 RT 
instead of Windows 8.1, it brings some unique 
compromises. Those compromises will be deal 
breakers for some people. Other people will 
say, “Who needs that, anyway?”
Here they are, in no particular order:
	✓	No desktop programs: Surface 2 can run 
only apps downloaded from the Windows 
Store. You can’t install desktop programs 
like you can on a desktop PC.
	✓	No Windows Media Center: Unlike 
Windows 8 computers, Surface 2 won’t 
let you install Windows Media Center for 
viewing DVDs and watching or recording 
TV shows.
	✓	No Windows Media Player: The Surface 2 
desktop doesn’t include Windows Media 
Player. To watch movies and listen to music, 
you must use the built-in Music and Video 
apps or download replacement music and 
video apps from the Windows Store.
	✓	Can’t start a homegroup: When con­
nected to a network, the Surface 2 can join 
homegroups and access files from other 
networked computers. However, those 
computers can’t access your files. To share 
your files, you can upload them to OneDrive, 
copy them to a portable flash drive (or hard 
drive), or send them through e-mail.
	✓	No driver support: Windows RT relies on 
its own set of built-in drivers — special 
software that lets it communicate with 
plugged-in accessories. Because you 
can’t install drivers, the Surface 2 won’t 
work with some USB gadgets such as TV 
tuners, barcode readers, GPS units, and 
other devices that require you to install a 
program.
	✓	No GPS: Lacking a GPS chip, the Surface 2 
relies on Wi-Fi to estimate your location. That 
narrows down your location to within a few 
hundred feet. (Surface 2 with a built-in 4G LTE 
cellular data plan also lacks a GPS.)
	✓	No NFC (Near Field Communication): Too 
new of a technology to disappoint many, 
NFC lets two devices exchange bursts of 
information when they bump into each 
other, a feature much-welcomed by busi­
ness-card swappers.

14
Part I: Introductions 
I won’t list all the advantages here because the Surface Pro 2 is basically 
a powerful desktop PC flattened into a tablet. Any software that runs on a 
Windows 8.1 desktop PC runs on a Surface Pro 2.
The same holds true for gadgets you plug into the Surface Pro 2’s USB port: 
network ports, bar code readers, scanners, MIDI gadgets, and other specialty 
items.
But all that power brings a few compromises:
	
✓	Battery life: You can expect six or eight hours of battery life, perhaps 
more, depending on your use. But the battery probably won’t last as 
long as it does on the Surface 2.
	
✓	Higher cost: Surface 2 pricing begins at $449 for a model with 2GB of 
memory and 32GB of storage. The Surface Pro 2 begins at $899 for 4GB 
of memory and 64GB of storage.
	
✓	No Microsoft Office: Unlike the Surface 2, the Surface Pro 2 doesn’t 
include Microsoft Office. If you need that program, you must buy and 
install it separately.
	
✓	No connected standby: When the tablet’s asleep, it’s really asleep. It 
won’t collect your e-mail in the background.

Identifying a Surface Model
Not sure which Surface model you’re viewing? You can find out by lifting the 
kickstand on the back of the tablet and peeking underneath. There, you see 
the word Surface, as well as this identifying information:
	
✓	Surface RT: These all-black, first-generation models list the term 
Windows RT beneath a Windows logo. You’ll also see the amount of stor­
age listed as either 32GB or 64GB. The kickstand’s visible side shows a 
Windows logo.
	
✓	Surface Pro: These first-generation models list the term Windows 8 
beneath the Windows logo. You’ll also see the amount of storage, 64GB 
or 128GB.
www.it-ebooks.info

18
Part I: Introductions 
	
✓	Surface 2: These look much like the Surface RT tablets, down to the 
term Windows RT listed beneath the Windows logo. However, these 
second-generation tablets have a black front with a silver back. Beneath 
the kickstand, the amount of storage is listed as either 32GB or 64GB. 
Models with a 4G LTE data plan have a SIM card slot on the left edge 
below the volume rocker.
	
✓	Surface Pro 2: These second-generation models list the term Windows 8.1 
beneath the Windows logo. You also see the amount of storage, 64GB, 
128GB, 256GB, or 512GB.
The serial number of your Surface, needed for warranty and service informa­
tion, is printed directly beneath the word Surface under the kickstand.
The serial number of a Surface keyboard is printed on the right edge of its 
spine — that raised edge that clicks onto the Surface when attaching the 
keyboard.
	
Before buying a used Surface on eBay, make sure the seller posts a clear photo 
of the information printed beneath the kickstand. That way you know exactly 
what’s being sold.
Understanding Your Surface’s 
Storage Space
Microsoft sells its various Surface tablets with up to 512GB of storage space. 
However, Microsoft tosses some of its own software onto the tablet, which 
reduces storage space for your own files. Windows consumes some of that 
space, for example, as do the bundled apps and troubleshooting tools.
That means you can’t copy 32GB of music onto a 32GB Surface. So, how much 
information can you store? Table 1-3 explains exactly how much storage 
space you’ll have on each Surface model.
If you need more storage, you can always slip a microSDXC memory card into 
the microSD memory slot of any Surface.
The Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 come with 200GB of free OneDrive storage 
for one year. I describe how to activate it in Chapter 3.

Getting Started with Your Surface
In This Chapter
▶	Removing the packaging
▶	Charging the battery
▶	Looking for missing items
▶	Identifying your Surface’s parts
▶	Attaching the keyboard
▶	Positioning the Surface for use
W

hether your Surface arrives in the mail or in a shopping bag from your 
local Microsoft Store, the fun doesn’t start right away. No, first you 
need to remove your Surface from its packaging and charge the battery —  
tasks I cover in this chapter.
While you’re waiting for the battery to charge, take some time to identify all 
of your Surface’s ports, slots, and attachments, all pointed out in this ­chapter. 
Some of them sit in plain sight; others hide in mysterious crevices.
But no matter where they hide, this chapter points them all out so you know 
what each one does. That way, you can either impress your friends or bore 
them to tears with your Surface port acumen.
The Grand Unboxing
The Surface comes artfully packed in a black box, shown in Figure 2-1. 
Look at the top-right corner, and you can see a white box protruding from 
inside. It’s either an artful display of design creativeness or a waste of paper, 
depending on your mood.

Part I: Introductions 
Figure 2-1: 
The Surface 
comes 
packaged in 
a white box 
that’s been 
pushed 
inside a 
black box.
To unpack your Surface, follow these steps:
	
1.	Remove the small strip of clear plastic tape holding the white box to 
the black sleeve.
	
2.	Slide the white box out of the black sleeve.
	
3.	If your Surface included a keyboard, remove the Touch Cover key­
board and its black cardboard packaging from beneath the box.
	
	 Microsoft bundled a Touch Cover keyboard with some early Surface RT 
models. Now, none of the Surface models include a keyboard; it’s consid­
ered an accessory to be purchased separately.
	
4.	Remove the small strip of plastic tape holding the white box shut and 
then open the lid.
	
	 The lid opens, with the hinge along the right edge. As the lid opens, you 
see the Surface resting peacefully inside, as shown in Figure 2-2, com­
plete with its power adapter.
	
5.	Remove the Surface from the box and remove its plastic wrapper.
	
6.	Remove the manual and paperwork from the box beneath the Surface 
and remove the charger.
And that’s it. The Surface’s battery comes partially charged, but before turn­
ing it on, you should plug it into the charger, as described in the next section. 
When you’re ready to turn on your Surface, flip ahead to Chapter 3.

Figure 2-2: 
All Surface 
models

adapter, 
thankfully. If 
they didn’t, 
you’d be 
powerfully 
annoyed.
As you remove the Surface from its packaging, take note of these things:
	
✓	The Surface’s manual, if you can call it that, contains illustrations with 
IKEA-inspired instructions: single sheets of paper with line drawings and 
arrows. Microsoft supplements it with a downloadable user guide avail­
able at its website: www.microsoft.com/surface/userguides.
	
✓	Pounce on the two blue cards, found as soon as you lift the Surface 2 
or Surface Pro 2 from the box. One card has a password for 200GB of 
OneDrive (formerly known as SkyDrive) storage space, free for two 
years. The other card offers a year’s worth of Skype WiFi and Unlimited 
World. I explain those services and how to redeem them, as well as their 
fine print, in Chapter 3.
	
✓	Your Surface’s serial number is listed on the box’s UPC code sticker. 
(It begins with the letters S/N.)
	
✓	Your Surface’s serial number and amount of storage space also appears 
hidden beneath the kickstand.
	
	If your Surface needs to be returned for service, you need to enter its 
serial number on Microsoft’s online support site.
	
✓	The serial number for the optional keyboard appears on the right edge 
of its spine.

✓	Okay, if you can’t wait, feel free to use the Surface while it’s charging. But 
flip ahead to Chapter 3, where I walk you through the process of turning 
it on for the first time.
Charging the Battery
The Surface’s bundled charger is lightweight, smaller, and flatter than many 
adapters, making it easy to carry. In the North American version, the outlet’s 
prongs make sturdy little clicks as they fold in and out.
The charger plugs into the wall easily, politely leaving room to plug some­
thing into the adjacent outlet. The charger’s other end has five little metal 
pins that line up with the five little metal pins recessed into a gap along your 
Surface’s right edge.
	
When attached correctly, a little light begins glowing on the charger’s end. If 
you don’t see that little light, try wiggling the charger until it seats more firmly 
in the slot.
Follow these steps to charge your Microsoft Surface:
	
1.	Unfold the prongs from the charger’s long end, if necessary, and plug 
them into an outlet.
	
	 On North American models, the prongs fold in for easy storage and 
out for plugging into a wall. Plug the charger into the wall so it doesn’t 
cover the second wall outlet, and you’ll leave room for plugging in other 
gadgets.
	
	 On the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2, you need to plug the charging 
cable into the charger. It’s easy to see which end fits into which spot.
	
2.	Place the prong’s small end into the charger on your tablet’s lower-
right side.
	
	 The five magnetically charged metal ports on the end of the charger 
cable should mesh with the five magnetically charged ports on your 
tablet’s lower right side. The connector fits in either way, shown in 
Figure 2-3, with the cord pointing up or down your tablet’s edge.
	
	 If the connector doesn’t snap tightly into the groove, it won’t charge — 
even when it feels like it’s in place. The key is to look for the little light 
on the connector (shown in Figure 2-4). Keep rocking the connector from 
side to side until the light glows. When it glows, it’s charging.
	
	 On some newer chargers, the glowing light surrounds the plug’s tip; on 
others, it’s a tiny pinpoint of light, like the one shown in Figure 2-4.
	
3.	Wait for the Surface to charge.

Part I: Introductions 
Your Surface takes between two and three hours to charge completely. It may 
charge in less time, depending on how low its battery has drained. You can 
use your Surface while it’s charging, but the charging time will take longer.
For such a simple device, the charger leads to a long list of stipulations:
	
✓	You can’t charge the Surface from another computer’s USB port.
	
✓	You can charge your phone or other USB gadgetry from the USB port of 
any Surface. If possible, though, plug your Surface into the wall first to 
avoid draining its battery.
	
✓	In a pinch, you can charge any Surface with the charger from any other 
Surface model. However, the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 charge much 
more quickly when using their own Pro chargers.
	
✓	For travelers, Microsoft offers a portable charger that plugs into a car’s 
cigarette lighter. I cover optional Surface accessories in Chapter 17.
	
✓	The power connector doesn’t fit very easily into the Surface RT and the 
Surface Pro; a gentle rocking motion usually snaps it into place. On the 
Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2, the connector snaps into place much more 
easily.
	
✓	Unlike the 24 watt chargers bundled with the Surface RT and Surface 2, 
the power adapter bundled with the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 puts 
out 48 watts. Its adapter also includes a USB port for charging accesso­
ries, a handy feature missing from the power adapter bundled with the 
Surface RT and Surface 2.
Figuring Out What’s Included 
and What’s Missing
The only things included in the box are the Surface, its charger, and its minis­
cule paperwork.
Unless you paid extra for accessories, Microsoft left out these popular items, 
unfortunately:
	
✓	Keyboard: You can purchase the Surface keyboards at Microsoft’s online 
store (www.microsoftstore.com) or at any Microsoft Store retail loca­
tion. Designed specifically for the Surface, they also fold over the screen 
as a cover. I describe them all in more detail in Chapter 5.
www.it-ebooks.info

27
 Chapter 2: Getting Started with Your Surface
	
	If you don’t want to spring for the expensive keyboard covers, you can 
plug any desktop PC keyboard into a Surface’s USB port. Bluetooth 
(wireless) keyboards also work well; I explain how to connect Bluetooth 
devices in Chapter 6.
	
✓	Cables: You can plug your Surface into an external monitor or HDMI TV 
set for watching movies, gaming, or just fiddling around. Unfortunately, 
Microsoft didn’t include the cables. For more information on the 
required cables, flip ahead to Chapter 6.
	
✓	Memory card: The Surface includes a memory card slot, but it’s empty. 
Adding a memory card adds storage, as I describe in the next section.
	
✓	Microsoft Office: The Surface RT and Surface 2 include a pre-installed 
copy of Microsoft Office 2013 RT, the suite of programs with Outlook, 
Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. The Surface Pro and Surface 
Pro 2 don’t include Office, however. If you want it, you must buy and 
install it yourself.
	
✓	Stylus: You can draw on your Surface RT and Surface 2 with a plastic 
pen called a stylus, but only the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 include 
one. And their stylus won’t work on the Surface RT or Surface 2. (Those 
models require a different type of stylus, which I cover in Chapter 5.)
Identifying the Parts of 
Your Surface Tablet
Waiting for your battery to charge can be pretty boring. So, while you’re 
waiting for your Surface to charge fully for the first time, spend some time 
examining its front, back, and edges, as shown in Figure 2-5 (which shows the 
Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2) and Figure 2-6 (which shows the Surface RT and 
Surface Pro).
This section explains the holes, switches, and distinguishable doodads on 
each Surface model, what they do, and what they won’t do.
	
✓	On/Off toggle switch: Pressing this simple on/off toggle switch in the 
top-right corner doesn’t really turn your tablet on or off. Instead, it puts 
your tablet to sleep: a low-power state where your tablet shuts down 
everything but the essentials. Then, when you tap the On/Off toggle 
again, the Surface wakes up with all of your open apps and documents 
just the way you left them.

www.it-ebooks.info

30
Part I: Introductions 
	
✓	Microphones: Only the Surface RT boasts a pair of stereo microphones 
across its top edge. The Surface Pro has a single microphone on its top. 
The Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 have front and back microphones for 
picking up the appropriate sounds when recording movies.
	
✓	Speakers: This pair of speakers lives near the top of your Surface’s sides, 
providing surprisingly good stereo separation. The speakers aren’t extraor­
dinarily loud, however, which is great for neighboring hotel rooms, but not 
so good at your own party.
	
✓	microHDMI port: This port lets you send high-definition video from 
your Surface RT or Surface 2 to an external monitor or TV. You can 
buy the cool-looking $40 video cable from Microsoft’s website, or you 
can use almost any microHDMI cable, which usually costs around five 
dollars.
	
✓	mini DisplayPort: The Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 offer this newer 
type of port, often found on Apple laptops. It puts out high resolution 
video through a mini DisplayPort cable.
	
✓	USB port: This port, the same size as the ones found on desktop PCs and 
laptops, lets you plug in keyboards, mice, portable hard drives, and other 
USB accessories. Only the Surface RT USB port uses USB 2.0; the Surface 
Pro, Surface 2, and Surface Pro 2 all use the newer, faster USB 3.0 port.
	
✓	Charging port: Described in the previous section, this odd five-button 
port on the lower-right side lets you charge your Surface with your bun­
dled adapter or through Microsoft’s auto charger cable, sold separately.
	
✓	Headphone jack: Headphones and external speakers plug into this ⅛-inch 
port on the left side.
	
	The headphone jack also accepts specially designed microphones. These 
microphones, compatible with iPhones and iPods, have three thin stripes 
on them and are slightly longer than regular microphones, which only 
have two thin stripes.
	
✓	Volume control: This rocker switch on the Surface’s top-left side works 
as expected: Press the top portion to raise the volume; press the lower 
portion to lower it. As you press the control, the screen shows the cur­
rent sound level. (You can also mute the volume with a Touch or Type 
Cover keyboard, covered in Chapter 5, or any keyboard with dedicated 
Windows 8 keys.)
	
✓	Keyboard connector: This mysterious magnetic connector on the 
bottom edge works only with the Surface’s special click-on keyboards. 
To use a standard keyboard, just plug the keyboard’s USB plug into 
the USB port on your Surface’s right edge. I describe how to connect 
Bluetooth keyboards, mice, and other accessories in Chapter 6.
www.it-ebooks.info

31
 Chapter 2: Getting Started with Your Surface
	
✓	Kickstand: Folding flush against the Surface’s lower back edge, the kick­
stand flips out to prop up your Surface when you’re working at a desk. 
It works on laps, as well, but doesn’t feel as substantial and flat as a tra­
ditional laptop. It opens easiest from either of the two bottom corners 
and, in a boon for lefties, from the indent along the bottom-left side.
	
	The Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 add a second position to the kickstand, 
making the Surface easier to use on laps and airplane trays.
	
✓	microSDXC slot: This slot hides behind the kickstand on the Surface 
RT and Surface 2, and on the right edge of the Surface Pro and Surface 
Pro 2. But no matter which Surface you own, the slot accepts a microSD, 
­microSDHC, or a microSDXC card, the same types found in many cell 
phones for the past few years. Many stores sell cards with up to 128GB 
of storage space.
	
✓	Camera: These two cameras, located on the top center of the Surface’s 
front and back sides, take mediocre snapshots and shoot high-definition 
video. Most smartphones do a better job. One cool thing: The back 
camera is angled downward at 22 degrees, so it shoots straight when the 
tablet sits with its kickstand out on the table.
	
	When shooting with the back camera on the Surface 2 or Surface Pro 2, 
keep the kickstand in its first position, or the camera won’t shoot 
straight.
	
✓	Recording light: Barely visible next to each camera lens, this tiny white 
light glows whenever you’re framing or shooting a photo or video. In 
fact, if you see it glowing, smile: You’re being recorded.
	
✓	Ambient light sensor: Located near the front camera, this barely visible 
sensor constantly measures the light surrounding the screen. When you 
walk into a dark room, the screen dims slightly, making it easier to read 
(and preserving battery life). Similarly, walk outdoors in the sunlight, 
and the screen brightens to make it easier to read. If you find that this 
feature leads to constant screen flickering, I explain how to disable it in 
Chapter 14.
	
✓	Windows key button: Located on the bottom front of your tablet, this 
looks more like a logo than a button. And it doesn’t physically move when 
pressed. But your tablet senses your finger’s presence and behaves as if 
you’ve pressed your keyboard’s Windows key. It returns you to the Start 
screen. Or, if you’re already at the Start screen, it returns you to your 
­last-used app or program.

Part I: Introductions 
Attaching the Keyboard
The Surface’s special Touch and Type Cover keyboard covers adhere to the 
Surface by strong magnets, and they’re not difficult to attach. (The Touch 
Cover 2 and Type Cover 2 keyboards come with even stronger magnets.)
Hold the keyboard’s connector anywhere close to the connector on the 
Surface’s bottom edge, shown in Figure 2-7, and they lunge for each other.
Figure 2-7: 
Match the 
Touch or 
Type Cover 
keyboard’s 
connector 
with the 
­connector 
on the 
bottom 
of your 
Surface, 
and they 
click into 
place.
However, like tired wrestlers, they occasionally miss. (To test the connection, 
press the keyboard’s Windows key. If the keyboard is connected, your Surface 
should toggle between your Start menu and your last-used application.)
If your Surface doesn’t acknowledge your keyboard’s keystrokes, try holding 
down the keyboard and sliding the Surface to the left and right until you feel 
the keyboard lock into place.
Still not working? Try restarting your Surface with the keyboard attached: 
Swipe in from the screen’s right edge to fetch the Charms bar, tap the Settings 
icon, tap the Power icon in the Settings pane, and tap Restart from the 
pop-up menu.
www.it-ebooks.info

33
 Chapter 2: Getting Started with Your Surface
Still not working? Try wiping any oil or dirt from the two connectors. If it 
still doesn’t work, it’s time to drop by a Microsoft Store in your city or con­
tact the Microsoft Surface Online Service Center (https://myservice.
surface.com).
Positioning the Surface
Your Surface works in a variety of positions. No matter how you hold it, the 
screen flips to be right-side up. Although convenient, it’s also disorienting: 
The familiar power button on the top right suddenly lives on the bottom left.
To remember which side is really up, take a look at the white Windows logo 
button on the Surface’s bottom-front edge. When the logo is on the bottom, 
your tablet is right-side up, and all the buttons are where they should be. 
If it’s on the top, either turn your Surface right-side up or remember that the 
buttons aren’t in their normal positions.
When you’re seated, fold out the Surface’s kickstand from the Surface’s back: 
Place your finger in the indentation on the back’s lower-left edge and pull out; 
the kickstand snaps into place.
Although it looks precarious, the Surface and its kickstand actually feel pretty 
solid on a lap, especially with an attached clip-on keyboard. (Pull the kick­
stand out to its second position on the Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 for even 
better lap traction.)
Finding Microsoft Website Support 
for the Surface
Microsoft offers several official sites dealing with the Surface, its sales, and 
support:
	
✓	Microsoft Surface Tablets (www.microsoft.com/surface): 
Microsoft’s catch-all page for the Surface, this describes the latest 
models in detail, lets you sign up for the mailing list for product 
announcements, and provides links to the online store and support 
pages.
www.it-ebooks.info

34
Part I: Introductions 
	
✓	Microsoft Surface Support (www.microsoft.com/surface/support): 
Visit here if your Surface doesn’t seem to work correctly. You can walk 
through some troubleshooting steps, and if they don’t work, you can 
contact Microsoft’s technical support. They’ll assess the situation and 
then make arrangements for a replacement if it’s still under warranty.
	
✓	Microsoft Community Support (http://answers.microsoft.com/
en-us/surface/forum): Surface owners ask questions and share tips 
on this Microsoft forum. Microsoft representatives also help answer 
questions.
	
✓	Windows Compatibility Center (www.microsoft.com/en-us/
windows/compatibility): Here you can see what devices people 
report to have worked with Windows 8, Windows RT, Windows 8.1, and 
Windows 8.1 RT. Unfortunately, Microsoft tends to think everything 
is compatible until proven otherwise. Don’t be surprised to see your 
incompatible items listed here as compatible.

▶	Downloading updates from Windows Update and the Store
▶	Setting up user accounts
▶	Turning off your Surface
Y

ou’ve taken your Surface out of the box. You’ve charged the battery. If 
you bought an optional keyboard, you’ve attached it to your Surface.
But your Surface still isn’t ready for action.
This chapter walks you through everything you need to do when first turning 
on your Surface: Sign in with a Microsoft account (or create a new one), name 
your Surface, download and install updates, and then set up user accounts 
for each person who will be using your Surface.
Turning On Your Surface for the First Time
After prying off all the cardboard, peeling off the plastic wrappers, and charg­
ing your Surface, the fun begins. If you’re near a wireless network, make sure 
it’s turned on and that you know the network’s name and password. You’ll 
need to enter those so the Surface can connect with the Internet and down­
load all the updates it missed while hiding in its box.
This setup is nearly identical for all four Surface models, so follow these 
steps to turn on your Surface for the first time:
	
1.	Press and release the power button on your Surface’s top-right edge.
	
	 I describe all of your Surface’s buttons in Chapter 2. Two or three sec­
onds after you press and release the button, the word Surface appears 
in white letters on a black screen as your tablet churns its way to life. 
After a minute or two, it leaves you staring silently at the opening screen 
called Region and Language.
www.it-ebooks.info

36
Part I: Introductions 
	
	 If you made a mistake while following any of the next steps, hold down 
the Surface’s power button for about five seconds until it turns off. 
Release the power button, wait a second, and then press and release it 
again to turn on your Surface. When your Surface wakes up, it begins at 
the opening step, letting you start over.
	
2.	Tap your preferred language from the list.
	
	 As soon as you tap one of the listed languages, the Next button’s wording 
changes to that language, letting you follow the menu choices in your 
native tongue.
	
3.	Verify your Country/Region, preferred App Language, Keyboard 
Layout, and Time Zone.
	
	 Your Surface asks you to verify these things:
 
• Country or Region: Choosing your geographic location helps your 
Surface display information tailored to your surroundings.
 
• App Language: Here, you can choose what language you’d like 
your apps to use, a boon for the bilingual.
 
• Keyboard Layout: In another hat tip toward the bilingual, this 
option lets you change your Surface’s onscreen keyboard to show 
accent marks and characters from different languages and regional 
dialects.
 
• Time Zone: Choosing the correct time zone helps your Surface and 
its apps keep you aware of the correct time.
	
	 The decisions you make here aren’t permanent. If you want to change 
your Surface’s keyboard layout to accommodate other languages, check 
out Chapter 14.
	
	 If you ponder a menu option for more than two minutes, the screen goes 
blank to preserve battery life. To revive it, touch the Windows key cen­
tered beneath your screen. (Or, if you have a keyboard cover attached, 
tap any key.)
	
4.	Tap Next.
	
5.	When the License Terms page appears, read the License Terms agree­
ment and tap the I Accept button.
	
	 Pull up a chair and relax. The Surface agreement is about 6,000 words 
long.
	
6.	When the Personalize screen appears, choose your Start screen’s 
background color, type a name for your Surface into the PC Name 
box, and tap Next.
	
	 As you tap in different places on the colored strip shown in Figure 3-1, 
the background color changes to match the color beneath your finger. 
Spot a color you like? Lift your finger to lock that color into place. 
(I explain how to change the color in Chapter 14.)

 Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Surface
Figure 3-1: 
Slide your 
finger along 
the bar to 
choose a 
color and 
then create 
a name for 
your new 
Surface.
	
	 Then, tap inside the PC Name box and type a name for your Surface. If 
you haven’t attached a keyboard to your Surface, the tablet’s built-in 
keyboard pops up, letting you type your Surface’s new name. (I describe 
how to type on the built-in glass keyboard in Chapter 5.)
	
	 The name you choose here will identify your Surface when it connects to 
networks, either at home, work, or on the Internet. Give every computer 
a different name so you can tell which one is which.
	
	 After choosing a background color and name for your Surface, tap the 
Next button. (I explain how to change your Surface’s name in Chapter 14.)
	
	
	 After you leave this screen, the subsequent screens all have a backward-
pointing arrow in their top-left corner. Tapping a backward-pointing arrow 
lets you return to the previous screen and change any of your answers.
	
7.	When the Get Online screen appears, connect to a wireless network, if 
available, and tap Connect.
	
	 If you’re within range of a wireless network, the Surface lists all the wire­
less networks it detects, shown in Figure 3-2. If you spot your wireless 
network’s name, tap it; when the Connect button appears, tap it. Type 
your network’s password, if required, and then tap Next.
	
	 If you’re connecting to your home or work network, tap Yes at the screen 
asking whether you’d like to find PCs, devices, and content on the net­
work. (That tells your Surface to find any available networked printers, 
as well as anything else it can connect with.) If you’re connecting to a net­
work at a coffee shop or other public place, then tap No at that screen.
	
	 Not within range of a network? Don’t know the password? Then escape 
by tapping the words Skip This Step. You find out how to connect to a 
wireless network in Chapter 6.

Microsoft account e-mail address. If you didn’t connect, create a Local 
account and type a name and password.
	
	 At this point, your path diverges depending on whether you were able to 
connect with the Internet in Step 5.
 
• If you connected with the Internet and you already have a Microsoft 
account — an e-mail address you use to visit Microsoft services like 
Hotmail, Messenger, OneDrive (formerly called SkyDrive), Windows 
Phone, Xbox LIVE, or Outlook.com — type your Microsoft account’s 
e-mail address into the white box. Type your password into the 
box beneath it, shown in Figure 3-4. Then move to the next steps to 
verify your security information.

then walks you through the necessary steps to transform your 
favorite e-mail address into a Microsoft account. ( You need a 
Microsoft account to get the most out of your Surface tablet.)
 
• If you connected with the Internet but don’t want a Microsoft 
account, tap the words Create a New Account. On the next screen, 
tap the words Sign In without a Microsoft Account. Then create a 
Local account by typing your first name, a password, and a pass­
word hint.

Part I: Introductions 
No matter which path you take in Step 9, you tap the word Finish and then 
end up staring at the Windows Start screen. Welcome!
	
✓	If you signed in with a Microsoft account that you’ve used on other 
Windows 8.1 PCs, you’re asked how Windows should set up your PC. 
Choose the option called “Set This Up as a New PC Instead” because 
your Surface is a new PC.
	
✓	After you enter your Microsoft account, your Surface begins stocking 
itself with all of the settings, online contacts, and appointments stored 
by your Microsoft account. It also gives you access to the OneDrive 
account linked with your Microsoft account.
	
✓	When the OneDrive Is Your Cloud Storage screen appears, tap the Next 
button. You want to take advantage of your free OneDrive storage. If you 
don’t want free storage for some reason, tap Turn Off These Settings 
(Not Recommended) before tapping the Next button.
	
✓	If you couldn’t connect with the Internet and instead created a Local 
account, I explain how to convert a Local account into a much more conve­
nient Microsoft account in this chapter’s “Setting Up User Accounts” section.
Downloading Software Updates
No doubt, your new Surface has updates waiting for it. Some of the software fixes 
the latest bugs; others add features. If you’ve been able to connect to the Internet, 
your Surface will probably restart as soon as you sign in for the first time. And 
when it wakes up, it’s probably ready to download a second batch of updates.
Trusting your PC
Whenever you use a pre-existing Microsoft 
account on a new Windows 8 or 8.1 PC — and 
your Surface counts as a PC — Microsoft asks 
you to “Trust This PC.” The words Trust This 
PC may appear on a menu on your Surface or 
in an e-mail.
Trust it with what, you may ask? Actually, 
Microsoft wants to know if you trust this PC 
with your information. This security precaution 
ensures that you’re the one accessing the PC. 
Here’s how it works:
To verify your identity, Microsoft sends a secret 
code to the cell phone or e-mail address that 
you entered when first setting up your Microsoft 
account. When you receive the code, visit the 
listed web address and enter the code into the 
online confirmation box.
Microsoft then confirms that you are the 
person creating an account on the Surface, 
and it begins syncing all your passwords and 
sign-in information for your apps, websites, 
Wi-Fi networks, social networks, and your net­
work’s homegroup if you have one.

 Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Surface
In case your Surface still hasn’t connected with your wireless network, 
Chapter 6 offers more details on connecting to networks. If you have only 
wired Internet access, head for Chapter 17: You need a USB-to-Ethernet 
adapter, available from the Microsoft Store.
When you’ve successfully connected with the Internet and you want to make 
sure your Surface is up-to-date with all of its updates, follow these steps:
	
	
1.	Summon the Charms bar and tap the Settings icon.
	
	 Slide your finger in slightly from the screen’s right edge to fetch the icon-
filled strip known as the Charms bar. Then tap the Settings icon at the 
Charms bar’s bottom edge. The Settings pane appears. (I describe the 
Charms bar in Chapter 4.)
	
2.	Tap the Change PC Settings link from the bottom of the Settings pane.
	
	 The PC Settings screen appears.
	
3.	Tap Update and Recovery from the screen’s bottom-left corner; when 
the Windows Update screen appears, tap the Check Now button. 
Select your waiting updates and click the Install or Install and Restart 
button.
	
	 Windows Update searches for any waiting updates, which can take 
a long time. Depending on your Surface model, a screen similar to 
Figure 3-5 appears. There, you see any of these updates waiting for 
installation:
 
• Firmware updates: These large updates improve your Surface’s 
most basic functions. Firmware updates can improve the sound, 
battery life, camera, keyboard, and other physical items. Firmware 
updates usually require your Surface to be plugged in, so make 
sure your power adapter is handy. These updates always require a 
restart to take effect.
 
• Important updates: Because these updates usually fix security 
problems, your Surface normally downloads them automatically 
in the background. After they’re downloaded, your Surface installs 
them automatically within a few days. Or, if you happen to restart 
your Surface, it installs them then. (Your Surface needn’t be 
plugged in for these.)
 
• Recommended and Optional updates: These aren’t required for 
security, but installing them usually improves your Surface in other 
ways. For example, if you have an original Surface RT, the final ver­
sion of Office 2013 RT will be listed here to replace your preview 
version. You may also see updated drivers — software that helps 
your Surface communicate with printers, networks, and other 
gadgets.

	 If your Surface says it found updates and will install them automatically, 
you don’t need to do anything; the Surface will install them later.
	
	 If you want to force the update, perhaps before traveling, tap the words 
View Details. The View Details screen appears, letting you see the waiting 
updates and install them all with a tap of the Install button.

Tap the 
Install or 
Install and 
Restart

Surface.
	
4.	If asked, restart your Surface.
	
	 If you see a Restart Now button, tap it to restart your Surface. If you 
don’t see that button, follow this step to restart your Surface:
	
	
	 Summon the Charms bar by sliding your finger in from the screen’s right 
edge and then tap the Settings icon. Tap the Power button on the Settings 
pane and, when the pop-up menu appears, tap the words Update and 
Restart.
When your Surface returns to life, the updates are installed.
	
✓	After manually downloading the first big batch of waiting updates, you 
probably won’t need to check with Windows Update again. It will auto­
matically download and install any waiting updates a few days after their 
release.
	
✓	Windows Apps update automatically on the Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2, 
as well as on the Surface RT and Surface Pro after they’ve been upgraded 
to Windows 8.1 RT or Windows 8.1.

 Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Surface
Activating Windows
Your new Surface may toss a banner across the screen that brings everything 
to a halt: You need to Activate Windows. That means you need to link your 
particular copy of Windows to your Surface. Your Surface normally activates 
automatically when first connected to the Internet. But if you haven’t yet 
connected to the Internet, the banner appears, asking you to activate your 
Surface manually.
It’s a painless procedure that needs to be done only once. Tap the banner’s 
Go to PC Settings button. At the PC Settings screen, tap Activate Windows. 
Then on the Activate Windows screen (see Figure 3-6) do one of the following:
	
✓	If you’re connected to the Internet, tap the Activate button. Windows 
activates automatically. You’re through.
	
✓	If you’re not connected to the Internet, or you’re having trouble acti­
vating, tap the Activate by Phone button. Tapping this button fetches 
a menu. When you choose your geographic region, your Surface lists a 
telephone number along with a string of 56 numbers. You need to pick 
up a telephone, dial that number, and, when the robot answers, enter 
that string of 56 numbers with your telephone’s keypad.
	
	If you’re having trouble punching the numbers into your phone, you’re 
given the option to speak with a human. Hopefully, the human will prove 
more accommodating.

Part I: Introductions 
Downloading app updates from the Windows Store
If your Surface still runs Windows 8 or 
Windows RT, by all means, upgrade it to the 
new Windows 8.1 or Windows 8.1 RT. It’s a free 
upgrade, and it enhances your Surface in many 
ways. As just one example, the new version of 
Windows keeps your apps updated automati­
cally, which saves a lot of time.
If you stick with Windows 8 on your Surface 
RT or Surface Pro, you must update your apps 
manually by following these steps:
	 1.	 From the Start screen, tap the Store tile.
	 2.	 When the Store app appears, tap the word 
Updates in the Store app’s upper-right 
corner.
	
	 The store lists all of your waiting updates, 
each selected with a check mark in its 
upper-right corner. (Don’t want to update 
a particular app? Then deselect it before 
moving to the next step.)
	 3.	 Tap the Install icon from the Store app’s 
App bar.
	
	 The Store app begins downloading and 
automatically updating your apps.
You’ll have to repeat these steps every few days 
as new updates come out.
Creating a Recovery Drive
To be on the safe side, create a Recovery Drive 
for your Surface. Stored on a flash drive of 4GB 
(Surface RT, Surface 2) or 8GB (Surface Pro, 
Surface Pro 2), a Recovery Drive lets you rein­
stall Windows if your Surface no longer starts 
on its own and all resuscitation efforts fail.
Remember: You need to dedicate a flash drive 
to this purpose, and the process will erase 
everything stored on that drive.
To create a Recovery Drive, follow these steps:
	 1.	 From the Start screen, open the Charms bar, 
tap Search, and type Create a Recovery 
Drive into the Search pane.
	 2.	 Tap the Create a Recovery Drive link that 
appears below the Search box; when the 
User Account Control pop-up appears, 
approve the action by tapping the Yes 
button.
	 3.	 When the Recovery Drive window appears, 
follow the steps to insert your flash drive 
and create the Recovery Drive.
Label the flash drive as Surface Recovery Drive 
and stash it in a safe place. If your Surface ever 
falters, you can insert the Recovery Drive as 
one of the troubleshooting steps I describe in 
Chapter 15.

 Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Surface
Setting Up Your Free OneDrive 
and Skype Accounts
Unlike the first generation Surface RT and Surface Pro, the new Surface 2 and 
Surface Pro 2 models come with two perks: a free 200GB OneDrive account 
for two years and both Unlimited World and Skype WiFi for one year.
So, what does that mean? Here’s the scoop:
	
✓	OneDrive: OneDrive is a storage space that you can access from the 
Internet. By storing files on OneDrive, you can access them from anywhere: 
your Surface, your PC, your smartphone, or even any web browser. I 
explain how to use OneDrive, formerly called SkyDrive, in Chapter 6.
	
✓	Skype: Skype works like a telephone call or video conference between 
two PCs. Although it’s free when used between two PCs, calling landlines 
or cell phones with Skype costs extra. The one-year Unlimited World 
subscription lets you use Skype to call landlines and cell phones for free 
in many countries. And the one-year Skype WiFi subscription lets you 
connect to Skype WiFi hotspots around the globe for free, as well.
To activate them, find the blue cards packaged with your Surface 2 or Surface 
Pro 2. Visit the websites listed on the cards and enter the code printed on the 
cards’ backs.
Now, the fine print:
	
✓	You must redeem the offers within 90 days after buying your Surface. 
You can’t redeem them after December 31, 2014. And you can redeem 
only one offer per Microsoft account.
	
✓	To read more fine print and sign up for your free OneDrive space, visit 
www.skydrive.com/surface.
	
✓	To see the countries covered by Skype’s Unlimited World subscription 
and to sign up for your free Skype and Skype WiFi account, visit www.
skype.com/surface.
Setting Up User Accounts
Unlike competing tablets, your Microsoft Surface lets you create separate 
accounts for different people. That lets several people use the same Surface, 
with all of their information stored separately on their individual accounts.
Separate accounts make it easy to share a Surface among a family, for example. 
You can even set up limited-access accounts for children.
www.it-ebooks.info

46
Part I: Introductions 
Even if you’re the only person who will use your Surface, you may want to set 
up a second account for the inevitable friends who need to check their e-mail.
Your Surface lets you set up three types of accounts:
	
✓	Microsoft account: This links your account with Microsoft, letting you 
download apps and use many of Microsoft’s services. If you own a 
Surface, you want a Microsoft account.
	
✓	Local account: Local accounts are fine for simple work, letting you 
browse the web and create files using Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and One 
Note. But you can’t download any apps from the Microsoft Store without 
typing a Microsoft account and password, and many of the Surface’s 
bundled apps require a Microsoft account, too.
	
✓	Guest account: This handy temporary account gives you a way to let a 
friend borrow your tablet for a quick e-mail check without giving them 
access to any of your files. You find out how to set up a Guest account 
later on in this section.
To set up a new user account on your Surface (or to convert a Local account 
to a Microsoft account), follow these steps:
	
1.	From any screen, fetch the Charms bar and tap Settings.
	
	
	 Swipe your finger inward from the screen’s right edge and then tap the 
Settings icon. The Settings pane appears.
	
2.	Tap the Change PC Settings link.
	
	 The PC Settings page appears.
	
3.	From the left column, tap Accounts to see the Your Accounts page.
	
	 The PC Settings page’s Users section appears, shown in Figure 3-7.

account to

4.	If you have a Local account and want to create a Microsoft account, 
tap Connect to a Microsoft Account and follow the instructions.
	
5.	If you want to create a Local account, tap Other Accounts from the 
Accounts pane along the screen’s left side. Then tap Add a User.
	
	 When the How Will This Person Sign In? page appears, enter the new 
user’s Microsoft account e-mail address, if the user has one.
	
	 The How Will This Person Sign In? screen, shown in Figure 3-8, makes it 
clear that your Surface prefers each account to have its own Microsoft 
account.
	
	 If you know the person’s Microsoft account e-mail address, type it, click 
Next, and move to the next step.
	
	 If the person you’re adding doesn’t have a Microsoft account e-mail 
address, or you don’t know it, tap Sign In Without a Microsoft Account at 
the bottom of the page. That takes you to a page where you can create a 
Local account by typing the new user’s name and a simple password.
Figure 3-8: 
Enter the 
person’s

account 
e-mail and

6.	If you’re creating a Local account for a child, select the check box 
labeled “Is This a Child’s Account? Turn On Family Safety to Get 
Reports of Their PC Use.”
Whether you create a Microsoft account or a Local account, that account’s 
name then appears on the sign-in screen the next time you sign out of your 
account or turn on your Surface.

✓	Family Safety offers a way of monitoring the behavior of account holders 
by restricting the websites they can view, the programs they can access, 
and the time they can spend on the computer.
	
✓	To turn on the Guest account, fetch the Charms bar by sliding your 
finger inward from the screen’s right edge, tap the Search icon, and type 
guest account into the Search box. Then tap the Turn Guest Account On 
or Off link. When the Manage Accounts window appears, tap the Guest 
account icon and tap the next page’s Turn On button. That places a 
Guest account option on the Sign In screen.
Turning Off Your Surface
This section really doesn’t need to be here because you don’t ever need to 
turn off your Surface. In fact, pushing the power button just puts it to sleep. It 
doesn’t turn off the device at all.
Signing into a new PC with a Microsoft account
When you sign into a new Windows 8 or 8.1 PC 
with a Microsoft account, several things happen:
	✓	Trust: Microsoft will send a text mes­
sage with a code number to your phone 
or an e-mail to the e-mail address you’ve 
assigned to your Microsoft account. After 
you enter that code number into the new PC, 
Microsoft will trust it with your information.
	✓	Syncing: Because your passwords, set­
tings, and preferences are tied to your 
Microsoft account, the new PC will be set 
up with your own wallpaper, Lock screen 
photo, Start screen layout, desktop themes, 
installed apps, Internet Explorer favorites, 
and other items. (These settings are stored 
on OneDrive; depending on the speed of 
your Internet connection, they may take a 
few minutes to appear.)
	✓	Apps: Any apps you’ve purchased while on 
other PCs will be available to you on your 
new PC. (You’ll still need to download them, 
though, by tapping their tile on the Start 
screen. And because the newly installed 
apps will arrive with their stock settings, 
you may need to tweak them to meet your 
own needs.)
You can adjust all of these settings by open­
ing the Charms bar, tapping Settings, tap­
ping Change PC Settings at the bottom of the 
Settings pane, and choosing OneDrive from 
the PC Settings screen. There, in the OneDrive 
pane’s Sync Settings area, you can choose 
what items — if any — will travel with your 
Microsoft account as you move from one PC 
to another.
If you constantly move from one PC to another, 
you’ll definitely want to tweak those settings 
to make sure you approve of what information 
travels with you.

 Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Surface
	
The Windows RT and Surface 2 can sleep for days before the batteries give 
out. While the Surface sleeps, tap on the keyboard or power button to return it 
to life quickly with all your apps open, just the way you left it.
The Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2, however, don’t offer as much battery life. 
When their batteries give out, the Surface copies the contents of its memory 
to its hard drive and then turns off. Plug it into the wall, turn it back on, and, 
after a few moments, all of your open apps will reappear, just the way you left 
them. (Leave it plugged in until it’s fully charged before unplugging it.)
If you won’t be using your Surface for a while, you can turn it off by following 
these steps:
	
	
1.	Summon the Charms bar by sliding your finger in from the screen’s 
right edge and tapping Settings.
	
	
2.	When the Settings pane appears, tap the Power icon.
	
3.	Choose Shut Down from the Power icon’s pop-up menu.
When turned off, your Surface takes longer to start up than it does to awaken 
from sleep mode. And when it returns to life, you’ll have to reopen your apps.
	
	 If you’re already on the Start screen, you can shut down simply by tapping 
the Power button in the screen’s upper-right corner. Then choose Shut Down 
from the drop-down menu.

f you’ve never experienced Windows 8 or 8.1, you’re in for a surprise when 
you first turn on your Surface. No longer just a menu, the new Windows 
Start screen works like an operating system of its own, containing nearly all 
the tools a Surface owner needs.
Designed for tablets like the Surface, Microsoft built the new Start screen to 
be finger friendly and information packed. It serves up quick, informational 
tidbits with the least amount of effort.
If the Start screen lacks a tool you need for a particular task, visit the Windows 
Store (itself an app) and download an app to handle the job. Apps — small, 
touch-friendly programs — hail from the world of smartphones. In fact, a Surface 
works much like a smartphone with a larger screen.
This chapter explains how to get the most from the Start screen and its bun­
dled apps.
Unlocking and Signing In
When you turn on your Surface, the Start screen hides behind the Lock 
screen, shown in Figure 4-1. Yet even before you move past the Lock screen, 
your Surface already dishes up useful information.

and time, as well as the strength of your battery and wireless Internet con­
nection. Plus, you can customize the Lock screen to show your next appoint­
ment, your number of unread e-mails, and other bits of information.
To move past the Lock screen, swipe up with your finger, right-click a mouse, 
or press any key on the keyboard. The screen slides up and off the screen, 
revealing the Sign In screen, shown in Figure 4-2, listing all your user accounts.

To sign in, tap your user account and type your password. The tile-filled Start 
screen appears.
	
✓	When typing any hidden password, you can tap the little eye icon at the 
end of the password line for a peek at what you’ve typed. It’s a handy 
way to make sure you’re typing the correct password.
	
✓	If necessary, Windows reminds you with the words Caps Lock Is On. 
That reminds you to turn off the keyboard’s Caps Lock feature so you 
don’t mistakenly type your password with uppercase letters.
	
✓	If you see the Guest account listed, feel free to let a friend use it. The 
Guest account is handy for letting a friend temporarily sign on and 
check e-mail. I describe how to turn on the Guest account in Chapter 3.
	
✓	I describe how to customize your Lock screen background, icons, and 
user account photo in Chapter 14.
Managing Windows’ Start Screen
If you’ve used Windows before, you’re probably familiar with the Windows 
desktop. You’ve seen several open programs, each running inside its own 
resizable window.
That approach worked fine on desktop PCs with keyboards, mice, and large 
monitors. You could create spreadsheets and write reports for hours, all the 
while looking forward to lunchtime.
Tablets like your Surface, by contrast, let you manipulate information in 
many different situations. You fill out forms at job sites, for example, read 
books on the couch, or glance at a convention hall map while walking 
through rows of booths. Your Surface lets you do these tasks quickly, with 
your fingers, while on the go.
That’s where the Start screen comes in, shown in Figure 4-3.
Designed specifically for tablets, the Start screen resembles a personalized 
billboard. Filled with colorful tiles, the Start screen spreads across your 
Surface’s wide screen, extending off the right edge.
Each tile represents an app — a small program — and many tiles constantly 
percolate to bring up new information. Your Mail app’s tile, for example, con­
stantly cycles through your latest unread e-mails. The Weather app displays 
the ever-changing forecast for your location, and the Calendar app shows the 
time and location of your next appointment.

Figure 4-3: 
The Start

That’s not to say you can’t work on a Surface. Your Surface still includes 
the traditional Windows desktop — it’s an app waiting to be opened. Open 
the Desktop app with a tap on its tile, and the Start screen quickly clears to 
reveal the desktop, complete with its movable and resizable windows.
	
✓	To see the portion of the Start screen that disappears off the screen’s 
right edge, slide your finger along the screen from right to left, just as if 
you were sliding a piece of paper. As your finger moves, the Start screen 
travels along with it, bringing more tiles into view.
	
✓	To scroll through the Start screen with your Touch or Type Cover key­
board’s trackpad, put two fingertips on the trackpad. Slide your two fingers 
to the left or right, and the Start screen follows them. (Your keyboard’s 
arrow keys also scroll the screen: They let you jump from tile to tile.)
	
✓	Having trouble finding things on the Start screen? I explain how to orga­
nize your screen into neatly labeled groups later in this chapter.

and install new apps from the Windows Store in Chapter 7.
	
✓	I cover the Desktop app in Chapter 12. Microsoft worked hard to make 
the desktop finger-friendly. But if you’re looking for the same level of 
productivity you had on a desktop PC, attach your Surface keyboard. (A 
mouse works wonders on the desktop, as well.)
	
	Although the Desktop app is certainly convenient to have around, you 
probably won’t load it too often. The Start screen apps serve most needs 
quite well.

 Chapter 4: Introducing Your Surface’s Start Screen and Controls
Finding, Opening, Closing, and 
Switching between Apps
The Start screen heralds a new way of working with Windows and its eco­
system of small, inexpensive apps rather than large, expensive desktop 
programs.
To help you figure out this new world, these sections cover app basics: how 
to find them, open and close them, switch between them, and find their 
menus when they need a few tweaks.
Finding and opening an app
Your Surface’s Start screen, shown earlier in Figure 4-3, doesn’t show much 
organization. Your apps appear in a haphazard mess that sprawls out of 
view beyond the screen’s right edge. As you slide your finger along the Start 
screen from right to left, the tiles move, bringing more into view.
If you spot the app you’d like to open, tap it with a finger: The app fills the 
screen, ready for action.
However, the bigger task may be simply finding the app you want to open. 
The sprawling Start screen doesn’t alphabetize your apps or organize them 
into manageable groups. That leaves way too many hiding places.
When your sought-after app is lost in a sea of tiles, bring the app to the sur­
face by following these steps:
	
1.	Slide your finger up from the middle of the Start screen.
	
	 The Start screen displays an alphabetical list of all your apps, shown 
in Figure 4-4, followed by a list of your desktop programs, organized 
alphabetically by category. Still don’t spot the app you’re after? Move 
to Step 2.
	
	 The lower half of the Start screen normally sorts the apps alphabetically; 
to change that order, tap the words By Name next to the word Apps in the 
screen’s upper-left corner. There, you can choose to sort them by their 
installation date, by how often you use them, or by category.

screen 
reveals 
all your 
installed 
apps, alpha-
betized by 
name.
	
2.	Pinch the All Apps screen between two fingers.
	
	 The app icons disappear, and Windows lists the alphabet, from A to Z, 
shown in Figure 4-5. Tap the first letter of your lost app — J, perhaps — 
and Windows redisplays all the apps. This time, though, apps beginning 
with J are placed directly beneath your finger, making them easier to find.
	
	 This trick works best for Start screens with a huge number of apps. If 
you still can’t find your wayward app, move to Step 3.

3.	Search for the app.
	
	 Tap inside the Search box in the screen’s upper-right corner. Then begin 
typing the missing app’s name. As you type, Windows lists matching 
apps, narrowing down the list with each letter you type.
	
	 Spot your app? Tap its icon to launch it.
	
If you’ve added a keyboard to your Surface, just begin typing the app’s name 
directly onto the Start screen. The Start screen quickly transforms into a list of 
every app matching what you’ve typed so far. After you spot your app’s name 
on the list, tap it, and it leaps onto the screen. (Or, if your typing has narrowed 
down the list to one app, press Enter to launch the app.)
	
✓	The Start screen doesn’t show all of your installed apps. Unless you 
personally reorganize it, described at this chapter’s end, the Start screen 
shows only the apps Microsoft chose to be listed.
	
	
✓	Want an unlisted app to appear on the Start screen? Put it there your­
self: When looking at the app’s tile from the All Apps layout shown in 
Figure 4-4, tap and hold the app. (A check mark appears to let you know 
it’s selected, and the bottom menu appears.) Then tap the Pin to Start 
icon from the bottom menu.
	
	
✓	If an app says it’s already pinned to the Start screen, but you still can’t 
find the darn thing, tell Windows to take you there: Tap and hold the app 
from the All Apps view in Figure 4-4 and then tap the Find In Start icon. 
Windows returns to the Start screen, pointing out exactly where that 
app hides on the Start screen.
	
✓	Still don’t see an app that meets your needs? It’s time to visit the 
Windows Store, a trip covered in Chapter 7.
Closing an app
Older versions of Windows always wanted you to close unneeded programs: 
You’d click the little X in the program’s upper-right corner, and the program 
disappeared from the screen.
You won’t find any close buttons on apps, however: Apps aren’t meant to be 
closed. When they’re not being used, apps simply rest in the background, wait­
ing in case you need them again. They consume very few resources, and they 
don’t eat much, if any, battery power.
	
	 When you’re done with an app, just head back to the Start screen by pressing 
the Windows key on the front of your Surface. (You can also swipe in from the 
screen’s right edge and touch the Start icon on the Charms bar, covered later 
in this chapter.) Then load a different app to move on to another task.

Part I: Introductions 
But if you want to close an app, perhaps one that’s making annoying noises in 
the background, it’s not difficult:
	
To close the app currently filling your screen, slide your finger from the 
screen’s top edge all the way down to its bottom edge. As you slide, the app 
follows your finger, shrinking and then disappearing completely when your 
finger reaches the screen’s bottom edge.
It’s oddly empowering to watch your finger pull that unwanted app off the 
screen. It’s an easy trick to remember, and you’ll find yourself wanting to do it 
again and again.
If you’ve attached a mouse or trackpad to your Surface, you can also close 
an app by pointing the mouse arrow at the app’s top edge. When a tiny strip 
appears along the app’s top edge, click the X in the strip’s right corner, and 
the app closes.
Switching between apps
When they’re not in use, apps slumber in the background. Your Surface 
ignores them, devoting its full attention to the app currently filling the screen.
But if you want to awaken a previously used app, you can summon it with 
this easy trick:
	
To switch back to the app you’ve just used, swipe your finger inward from the 
Surface’s left edge.
As your finger moves inward from the screen’s edge, it drags your last-used 
app along with it. When the app begins to appear onscreen, lift your finger: 
The app grows to fill the screen.
Keep repeating the same trick, sliding your finger in from the left, and you’ll 
eventually cycle through all your currently open apps.
Can’t remember whether an app is already open? To see a list of your last six 
open apps, follow these steps from any screen on your Surface:
	
1.	Slowly slide your finger inward from the screen’s left edge.
	
2.	When you see an app begin to slide into view, slide your finger back 
to the left edge.
	
	 All of your opened apps appear in a column clinging to the screen’s left 
edge, shown in Figure 4-6.

apps.
After you see the apps’ thumbnails clinging to the screen’s left edge, you can 
perform a few other circus tricks:
	
✓	Return to an open app. Tap an app’s thumbnail from along the screen’s 
left edge, and the app fills the screen. Simple.
	
✓	Close an app. With your finger, slide the app slightly to the right and 
then down and off the screen. This one takes practice because the app 
tries to muscle its way onto the screen. (If you’re using a keyboard/
trackpad or mouse, you can right-click the unwanted app’s thumbnail 
and choose Close from the pop-up menu.)
	
✓	Remove the app column. Because that column of recently used apps con­
sumes some real estate, it closes by itself after you open one of its apps. But 
if you want to close it manually, just tap the currently open app. That brings 
Windows’ attention back to your current app and closes the column of apps.
	
Windows considers the desktop to be a single app, no matter how many pro­
grams are running in their own windows. Consequently, this app-switching 
trick won’t let you jump back to a particular program on the desktop; it only 
returns you to the desktop, where you can see all of the windows you happen 
to have left open.
Installing and uninstalling an app
You install apps through the Windows Store app. I describe how to install and 
uninstall apps in Chapter 7.

Understanding the Charms Bar
Although it sounds like something dipped in milk chocolate, the Charms 
bar is simply a menu. More than that, it’s a tool that unites every portion of 
Windows. The all-powerful Charms bar lives everywhere: on the Start menu, 
within every app, and even on the Windows desktop.
However, the Charms bar remains out of sight until you summon it with this 
trick:
	
Slide your finger inward from any screen’s right edge, and the Charms bar 
appears, shown in Figure 4-7. The Charms bar also fetches a helpful message 
in the screen’s bottom-left corner, showing the current time and date, as well 
as the strength of your wireless signal and battery.
The Charms bar displays five handy icons, each described in the following 
sections.

 Chapter 4: Introducing Your Surface’s Start Screen and Controls
	
All of the Surface click-on keyboards include keys dedicated to the Charms 
bar’s all-important icons. Look along the top row for keys dedicated to Search, 
Share, Devices, and Settings. The fifth icon, the Windows key, lives to the left 
of your keyboard’s spacebar.
Search
	
	 When you need to find something in the sea of text you’re currently viewing, 
fetch the Charms bar with a finger swipe inward from the screen’s right edge. 
Then tap the Search icon, shown in the margin.
The Search pane appears along the screen’s right edge, with a Search box 
ready for you to type what you’d like to find. The Search icon provides a 
quick way to find just about anything: an app, a long-lost file on your Surface, 
a particular song or album, a hidden setting, or a sought-after e-mail in your 
Mail app.
If you’re already on the Start screen, tapping the Search icon in the Start screen’s 
upper-right corner also fetches the Search pane, saving you some time.
But Search isn’t restricted to your Surface itself. It searches everything, 
including the Internet. As you type, the Search pane lists matches found on 
your Surface, shown in Figure 4-8. Below those matches, it lists items found 
on the Internet, as well.
Figure 4-8:

mand lists

www.it-ebooks.info

62
Part I: Introductions 
If a match appears even before you finish typing, tap the matching item; Search 
will show it to you, be it a setting, file, or web page plucked from the Internet.
	
✓	When you open Search, a list of things you’ve previously sought appears 
along the bottom of the Search pane, saving you from retyping the app’s 
name. Tap an item’s name to search for it again.
	
✓	The Search pane won’t search for files on your homegroup — other 
computers on your home network. You need to search those computers 
individually.
	
✓	The Search command will find apps stored on your Surface, and it even 
finds matches for apps available in the Windows Store. However, it can’t 
search for information you’ve stored inside your apps. To search inside 
a particular app, open it; most apps include a Search box in their upper-
right corner.
	
✓	To clear your search history or change your current Search settings, 
slide a finger in from the screen’s right edge, tap Settings, and then tap 
Change PC settings. Tap Search and Apps and then tap Search; the Clear 
button appears so that you can wipe away your past search history.
Fine-tuning your search
True to its name, the Search box normally 
searches everywhere: your Surface as well as 
the Internet. If that turns into information over­
load, you can target your search to a specific 
area by tapping the word Everywhere. A menu 
drops down, letting you direct your search to 
one of these specific areas:
	✓	Everywhere: The default search, this 
searches both your Surface and the Internet 
for matches.
	✓	Settings: A search in this box looks through 
every setting found in Windows’ two con­
trol panels: the Start screen’s PC Settings 
area and the desktop’s Control Panel. It’s 
handy for finding a helpful-but-rarely-used 
setting that’s hidden deeply in the Control 
Panel’s crevices.
	✓	Files: Choose this to search through every 
file on your computer, as well as files you’ve 
stored on OneDrive, Microsoft’s new name 
for its SkyDrive online storage space (cov­
ered in Chapter 6). Searching for files turns 
up songs, videos, documents, and photos, 
bringing a list of matching names to the 
forefront. When you spot the one you want, 
launch it with a tap.
	✓	Web Images: Don’t know what a Buff-
Collared Nightjar looks like? Choose Web 
Images for your search, and Windows dis­
plays Internet-posted photos of this oddly 
named bird.
	✓	Web Videos: Similar to the previous search, 
this finds videos, which is helpful when 
you’re tracking down movie trailers or 
YouTube videos.
The next time you open the Charms bar and tap 
the Search icon, the Search pane resumes to its 
normal Everywhere search.
www.it-ebooks.info

63
 Chapter 4: Introducing Your Surface’s Start Screen and Controls
	
✓	When you need to do more advanced searches — finding files created on 
a certain date, perhaps — open the Desktop app. Every desktop folder 
includes a Search box in its upper-right corner. To fine-tune your searches, 
tap the Ribbon menu’s Search tab and tap the type of search you need.
Share
Computers excel at sharing information. There’s little point in creating some­
thing unless you want somebody else to see it. That’s where the Charms bar’s 
Share icon comes in.
When you’re viewing something you want to share, fetch the Charms bar with 
a swipe of your finger inward along the Screen’s right edge.
	
 	When the Charms bar appears, tap the Share icon, shown in the margin. The 
Share pane appears, listing different ways you can share what you’re currently 
viewing. You’ll almost always see at least one universal sharing mechanism: the 
Mail app. Choose the Mail app to e-mail what you’re seeing to a friend.
Choose the Share icon while viewing a website, for example, to e-mail its link 
to a friend, shown in Figure 4-9. It also lets you post the link onto your social 
networks, such as Facebook. You can add the link onto your Reading List 
app, a handy way to revisit reading material in your spare time.
Figure 4-9:

Share

64
Part I: Introductions 
	
To e-mail a photo to a friend, open the Photo app and open your photo for 
viewing. Then tap the Charms bar’s Share icon and tap Mail. (I describe the 
Photo app in Chapter 10.)
Not all apps support the Share command, unfortunately. If an app doesn’t 
support it, there’s no way to share that app’s contents.
	
The Windows desktop lets you share a screenshot of your desktop, a handy 
way to let tech support people see what you’re experiencing. To send a desktop 
screenshot, open the Charms bar from the desktop, tap Share, and tap Mail. 
Your Surface takes a screenshot and attaches it to the e-mail, ready to be sent.
Start
	
	 When you want to return to the Start screen, slide your finger inward from 
the screen’s right edge to fetch the Charms bar, then tap the Start icon, 
shown in the margin.
If you’re already on the Start screen, a tap of the Start icon returns you to your 
last-used app, making it a handy way to toggle back and forth between the two.
However, touching the Windows key on the front of your Surface does the 
same thing, and it’s often faster. (You can also tap the Windows key on any 
keyboard to toggle between the Start screen and your last-used app.)
Devices
	
	 This oddly named Charms bar icon doesn’t say “Print,” but that’s probably what 
you’ll use it for most often. Tapping the Charms bar’s Devices icon lists all the 
devices attached to your computer that can interact with what’s on the screen.
Most of the time, that device will be your printer (or your printers if you’re 
connected to more than one).
To send something from your Surface to a connected device, summon the 
Charms bar by swiping inward from your Surface’s right screen and then tap 
Devices.
The Devices pane appears, shown in Figure 4-10, listing three items:
	
✓	Play: This lets you send videos, music, or photos to another device, such 
as an Xbox. It you don’t see your device listed, though, it’s not supported, 
unfortunately. And some videos prohibit playing them on another screen.
www.it-ebooks.info

65
 Chapter 4: Introducing Your Surface’s Start Screen and Controls
	
✓	Print: Tap this to see any connected printers able to print your currently 
viewed item. (I cover printers in Chapter 6.)
	
✓	Project: Tap this to send your Surface’s screen to another screen, usu­
ally a projector or monitor attached with a video cable. (I cover projec­
tors and second monitors in Chapter 6.)
Figure 4-10: 
The Devices 
icon lets you 
play music, 
print files, or 
project your 
screen to an 
attached TV 
or monitor.
When you tap Play, Print, or Project, Windows shows a list of connected 
devices able to receive your information. To print, for example, tap your 
printer’s name, adjust any settings the printer offers, and tap the Print 
button.
Settings
The Charms bar’s Settings icon lets you tweak the settings of the app you’re 
viewing, a perk when you’re desperately looking for an app’s menus, or need 
to adjust its boorish behavior. But this often-overlooked icon also serves as a 
gateway for tweaking many of your Surface’s most common settings.
	
	 To change your currently viewed app’s settings, summon the Charms bar 
by sliding your finger in from the screen’s right edge. When the Charms 
bar appears, tap the Settings icon. The Settings pane appears, shown in 
Figure 4-11.

Atop the Settings pane, you see the settings available for the app you’re cur­
rently viewing onscreen. And along the pane’s bottom, you see these quick 
shortcuts to your Surface’s most-tweaked settings:
	
	
✓	Networks: This five-bar icon represents your wireless signal strength, 
as well as the name of the wireless connection that’s currently pouring 
the Internet into your Surface. (Tap the icon to find the Airplane Mode 
toggle, which turns off wireless when you’re on an airplane.)
	
	
✓	Volume: Tap here to fetch a sliding volume control. Slide the bar up to 
increase the sound; slide it down to lower it. The Volume toggle on the 
Surface’s top, left side does the same thing. (The dedicated Volume keys 
on the Surface’s Touch and Type Cover keyboards also do the same 
thing.)
	
	
✓	Screen: Tapping here brings a sliding control for screen brightness. Slide 
it up for a brighter screen; slide it back down to dim it slightly. (Tap the 
monitor icon atop the sliding control to lock your Surface’s rotation con­
trol, keeping it from constantly moving right-side up.)
	
	
✓	Notifications: Designed for people tired of seeing notifications about 
instant messages and other informational tidbits popping up onscreen, 
this button lets you hide them for one, three, or eight hours so you can 
get some work done.
	
	
✓	Power: Tap here to sleep, shut down, or restart your Surface. (If you 
have updates waiting, you may also see Update and Restart.)

✓	Keyboard: This lets you switch between different keyboards or lan­
guages, as well as call up the onscreen keyboard, which is listed as 
Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel. I explain keyboard intricacies 
like that in Chapter 5.
	
✓	Change PC Settings: Tap here to visit the Start screen’s PC Settings area, 
a goldmine of settings for tweaking the Surface to meet your particular 
needs. (Visit the PC Settings area’s PC and Devices section, for example, 
to customize your Lock screen, Start screen, and account picture.) I 
cover the PC Settings area in Chapter 14.
Organizing the Start Screen
Windows doesn’t bother to organize your Start screen. When you download 
new apps from the Windows Store, they don’t appear on the Start screen. No, 
they’re tossed onto the All Apps area, which keeps them hidden.
Combine that with the fact that the Start screen was designed to look nice on 
the showroom floor, and you can see the problem: The Start screen doesn’t 
reflect the way you want to work.
So, follow this six-step plan to transform the Start screen into something that 
serves your own needs. It organizes your Start screen only as much as you’d like.
If you prefer working with a messy desk, stop after the first step or two. If you 
sort your pens by color in separate trays, follow these steps to the very end. 
When you’re through, your Start screen will transform into an array of neatly 
labeled groups with icons for all of your favorite apps in easy-to-find places.
Follow these steps to organize your Start screen into something you can 
live with:
	
1.	Remove tiles for apps you don’t want.
	
	 When you spot an app you don’t want to see on the Start screen, get 
rid of it: Hold your finger down on it until a menu bar appears along 
the screen’s bottom. Then lift your finger, noticing the check mark that 
appears on that app’s icon.
	
	 Now, tap any other unwanted icons; check marks appear on them, as 
well, showing that they’re selected for further action.
	
	
	 When you’ve selected all of your unwanted apps, tap Unpin from Start 
(shown in the margin) from the App bar along the screen’s bottom. 
Presto! The apps disappear from the Start screen. (Tap the Windows key 
to remove the App bar and return to the normal Start screen.)
www.it-ebooks.info

68
Part I: Introductions 
	
	 Choosing Unpin from Start doesn’t uninstall the app or program; it only 
removes the tile from the Start screen and returns it to the All Apps area. 
If you accidentally remove a tile for a favorite app or program, you can 
easily put it back in the next step.
	
	
	 Don’t ever want to see an app again? Then choose the adjacent Uninstall 
icon (shown in the margin) instead. Windows uninstalls the app, freeing 
up some valuable storage space. (I explain how to reinstall mistakenly 
uninstalled apps in Chapter 7.)
	
2.	 Add tiles that you do want.
	
	 Slide your finger upward from the middle of the Start screen; the Start 
screen slides upward with your finger to reveal the All Apps screen lurk­
ing below. There, you find icons for every installed app, listed in alpha­
betical order.
	
	 When you spot an app that you want to appear on the Start screen, 
hold your finger down on it until the App bar appears along the screen’s 
bottom. That selects the app; tap any others to select them, as well.
	
	
	 Then tap the Pin to Start icon from the Start screen’s bottom menu. 
Windows tosses a tile for each of your selected apps onto the Start 
menu’s far right end. A press of the Windows key removes the App bar 
and returns to the Start screen.
	
	 At this point, you’ve weeded out unwanted tiles and added the ones you 
like. To move related tiles closer together, move to the next step.
	
3.	Move related tiles closer to each other and resize them if necessary.
	
	 When related tiles appear next to each other, they’re easier to find on 
the Start screen. For example, I like to keep my people-oriented apps — 
Mail, People, and Calendar — next to each other on the left edge for easy 
access.
	
	 To drag a tile from one place to another, select it first by holding your 
finger down on it until the App bar appears along the screen’s bottom 
edge. Then drag the tile to its new location. Lift your finger, and the tile 
remains in its new home.
	
	 If a tile is too big or too small, change its size: Select the tile by holding 
your finger down on it. When it’s selected, tap the Resize icon from the 
App menu along the Start screen’s bottom and then choose the size: 
Large, Wide, Medium, or Small.
	
	 Remember, some apps have room to show live updates only on wide tiles.
	
4.	Move related tiles into groups.
	
	 Placing related tiles into separate groups makes them easier to relo­
cate. For example, you may want to create one group for tiles you use 
at home, another for work-related tiles, and a third for tiles that play 
media — choose whatever groups work for you.
www.it-ebooks.info

69
 Chapter 4: Introducing Your Surface’s Start Screen and Controls
	
	 To begin creating new groups, look closely at your Start screen: It comes 
set up in two groups. (See that empty spot separating the two groups?)
	
	 To create a new group, select a tile with a long finger press and then 
drag that tile into the empty space that separates two groups. As your 
dragged tile reaches that empty space, the groups move farther apart, 
shown in Figure 4-12, and a bar appears between them. Lift your finger, 
and the tile drops into place, forming the start of a new group.
	
	 Repeat this step; keep rearranging tiles and creating new groups until 
your related tiles live together in their own groups.
	
	 Each group of tiles would be easier to identify if it had a name, though. 
To do that, move to the next step.
Figure 4-12: 
Drag a 
selected tile 
between 
two groups. 
When the 
gray bar 
appears, lift 
your finger 
to drop the 
tile into 
place.
	
5.	Name the groups of related tiles.
	
	 In the first few steps, you may have noticed that something odd hap­
pened whenever you selected a tile: A strip with the words Name Group 
appeared over each group of tiles.
	
	 So, to name a group, select any tile. Then tap the Name Group strip 
over the group you’d like to name. When the strip turns white, type the 
group’s name and press Enter.
	
	 The new name appears above the group. Repeat until you’ve named all 
your groups.
www.it-ebooks.info

70
Part I: Introductions 
	
	 At this point, you may be organized enough. But if you want to move 
the groups into a different order, perhaps keeping your most important 
groups on the far left, where they’re always in view, move to Step 6.
	
6.	Move your most important groups to the far left, where they’re always 
visible.
	
	 Start by pinching the Start screen tiles between two fingers; as you slide 
your two fingers closer together, the tiles shrink until you’re looking at 
all of your groups onscreen, shown in Figure 4-13.
	
	 While you’re still looking at your groups as miniatures, shown in 
Figure 4-13, rearrange the groups by dragging them into new positions.
Figure 4-13: 
Pinch the 
Start screen 
with your 
fingers to

tiles, bring-
ing all your 
groups into

When you finish dragging, dropping, and naming tiles and groups, your Start 
screen is customized to the way you use your Surface. (I’ve shown mine in 
Figure 4-14.) Your tiles live in their own neatly named groups, and your most 
frequently accessed tiles appear first on the screen.
	
You can add favorite desktop folders to the Start screen, as well. While on 
the desktop, hold down your finger on a desired folder or library; when a 
square appears, lift your finger. Then, from the menu that appears, tap Pin 
to Start.

Browsing Files from the Start Screen
Eventually, you’ll need to browse through some files with your Surface. For 
example, you may need to grab some files off of that flash drive you just 
inserted into the USB port. Or perhaps you want to find and view a photo 
stored on OneDrive.
When you need to access files stored in some computer crevice, turn to 
the OneDrive app. Despite its name, the OneDrive app lets you browse files 
stored on your Surface, as well as on OneDrive.
To browse files and folders without leaving your Surface’s Start screen, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	From the Start screen, tap the OneDrive app.
	
	
	 Press the Windows key to return to the Start screen, if needed, and then 
tap the OneDrive app. (Can’t find it? Open the Charms bar, tap Search, 
and type OneDrive. When the Search pane lists the OneDrive app, tap 
its name to bring it to the screen.)
	
2.	Choose whether you want to browse files on your PC or on OneDrive.
	
	 The OneDrive app opens to show your folders and files stored on 
OneDrive, your storage space on the Internet. To see files stored on your 
Surface, tap the word OneDrive in the screen’s upper-left corner, shown 
in Figure 4-15, and choose This PC from the drop-down menu.
www.it-ebooks.info

72
Part I: Introductions 
	
	 When you tap the words This PC, the app lists all the storage areas 
available on your Surface: your Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos 
folders, for example, as well as your Desktop and Downloads folder. (The 
Downloads folder contains all the files you download from websites.)
	
	 The OneDrive app’s This PC section also lists places outside of your 
Surface. For example, you can access files shared on your homegroup 
from other networked PCs. (I cover networking in Chapter 6.)
	
	 If you’ve added a memory card, OneDrive lists it as “Secure Digital 
Storage Device.” Flash drives, by contrast, usually appear with the name 
“Removable Disk (D:)” or “Removable Disk (E:).”
Figure 4-15: 
Tap the 
word 
OneDrive 
and choose 
This PC to

3.	 Tap the folder or storage area you’d like to browse, or tap the file 
you’d like to open.
	
	 When you tap a storage area, OneDrive displays all of that storage area’s 
folders and files.
	
	 If you see your file’s name, tap it and you’re through: Your app opens it 
for action.
	
	
	 Tapped the wrong folder by mistake? Tap the Back arrow (shown in the 
margin) in the upper-right corner to return to the previous screen.
	
	 If you don’t see your desired file, keep tapping folders, opening different 
ones to keep looking.

 Chapter 4: Introducing Your Surface’s Start Screen and Controls
Still can’t find your file? Summon the Charms bar and tap the Search icon, 
described earlier in this chapter. The Windows Search feature can find your 
file fairly quickly. After you find it, remember its location so you can return to 
it with OneDrive.
I explain more about OneDrive, as well as how to transfer files to and from 
OneDrive, in Chapter 6.
Using the Start Screen with 
a Mouse and Keyboard
If you plan on using the Desktop app to crank out some serious work, you’ll 
want to attach your Surface’s keyboard or plug in a mouse and keyboard, as 
I describe in Chapter 6. The mouse and keyboard feel right at home on the 
desktop, of course, but the Start screen is a different world.
Yet, the mouse and keyboard still let you navigate the Start screen, although 
a little more awkwardly. If you wish, you can simply use your fingers while 
navigating the Start menu; plugging in your keyboard or a separate mouse 
and keyboard won’t disable the touch controls.
But if you’d prefer to leave your hands on your keyboard, trackpad, or mouse, 
Table 4-1 shows how to control the Start screen with a mouse and keyboard.

Chances are good, though, that you’ll still use your fingers on your Surface’s 
screen even after plugging in a mouse and keyboard. You’ll probably use the 
keyboard only for typing text, and the mouse for pointing at small items on 
the desktop.
Don’t forget the dedicated Charms bar keys atop the Surface’s Touch and 
Type Cover keyboards. They let you jump quickly to the Charms bar’s 
Search, Share, Devices, and Settings features.
Poking at the Power menu
The Power menu, shown in Figure 4-16, offers 
quick shortcuts to some oft-used locations 
in Windows. Some destinations are familiar; 
others are cherished only by network admin­
istrators. Here’s the rundown behind some 
options you may find useful:
	✓	Programs and Features: Tap this, and the 
Control Panel opens to the spot where you 
can uninstall unloved desktop programs.
	✓	Mobility Center: Introduced back in 2002, 
this panel helps old-timers find shortcuts 
to commonly used laptop settings. (Your 
Surface already lets you reach most of 
these from the bottom of the Charms bar.)
	✓	Power Options: Head here to adjust your 
Surface’s battery life. You can tell the 
screen to blank every five minutes instead 
of every two, for example, sacrificing a little 
battery life for more convenience.
	✓	System: This lifts the hood of your Surface, 
letting you see its make and model, amount 
of memory, processor type, exhaust mani­
fold, and similar hardware specs.
	✓	Device Manager: A powerful troubleshoot­
ing tool, this lists all of the parts inside of 
and attached to your Surface. You need 
to head here to update drivers, pieces of 
software that determine how your Surface 
talks to its parts.
	✓	Control Panel: Click this for a quick visit to 
the desktop’s Control Panel, rather than the 
Start screen’s PC Settings area.
	✓	File Explorer: When the Start screen’s 
OneDrive isn’t enough to manage your files, 
choose this to call in the desktop’s power­
house file manager.
	✓	Search: This simply calls up the Charms 
bar’s Search box.
	✓	Desktop: This not only takes you to the 
desktop but also minimizes any open win­
dows, letting you start a new project with­
out clutter.
The shortcuts I’ve left out appeal mostly to 
hardcore techies. They’re safely ignored.

Power users take note: If you right-click any screen’s bottom-left corner, a Power 
menu appears, shown in Figure 4-16. That menu places many oft-used settings 
a mouse-click away. (If you’ve attached a keyboard, summon the Power menu 
by pressing Win+X.) On the desktop, hold down your finger on the Start button; 
when a square appears, lift your finger to see the Power menu.

C

hances are good that you know how to click a mouse or manipulate a 
laptop’s trackpad. A touchscreen adds a third dimension: Now, your 
fingertips tell your Surface how to behave. This chapter covers the touch con­
trol tricks stashed inside every Surface warrior’s arsenal.
Here you discover your Surface’s seven main touch commands. Although 
these may sound complicated as you read them, envision your Surface’s 
display as a piece of paper: Most of the finger commands are as intuitive as 
manipulating a sheet of paper as it lies flat on a table.
This chapter also explains the Surface’s Touch and Type Cover click-on key­
boards, letting you know the special finger commands and gestures built into 
the touchpad. I also cover the newer Touch Cover 2 and Type Cover 2 key­
boards and their variants.
I explain how to write on the screen with a stylus, which comes bundled with 
both the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2. (I also explain which type of stylus 
works with the Surface RT and Surface 2 models.)
And because you may not have a keyboard, or your keyboard cover may 
be wrapped behind your Surface, I explain the mechanics of typing on the 
onscreen keyboard. Although unwieldy for most things, it’s a handy skill to 
have when you need it.

Part I: Introductions 
Controlling a Touchscreen 
with Your Fingers
Controlling a touchscreen sounds easy enough. You just touch it, right? 
Complicating matters, though, is that your Surface’s screen lets you touch 
it in seven different ways. And each type of touch does something very 
different.
The following sections describe the seven main ways to touch your Surface’s 
screen, as well as examples of when to use each one.
Tap
The equivalent of a mouse click, this is a quick tap and release of your finger. 
You can tap any item on the screen, be it a button, an icon, or some other bit 
of computer viscera. When in tight quarters, a fingertip often works better 
than the pad of your finger.
	 	
Example: Tap the Next button to move to the next step; tap the Charms bar’s 
Start button to return to the Start screen. Tap an app’s tile on the Start screen 
to open the app.
Double-tap
The equivalent of a mouse’s double-click, a double-tap is two quick taps of 
your finger. Double-tap any item on the screen that you’d like to double-click.
Example: Double-tap a desktop folder to open it. Double-tap a web page to 
make it larger.
	
On a Surface, many things can be opened by merely tapping. But if a tap 
doesn’t open an item, try the double-tap instead.

79
 Chapter 5: Typing, Touching, and Drawing on the Surface
Press and hold
To achieve the equivalent of a mouse’s right-click on the Windows desktop, 
tap the item but hold down your finger. A second or two later, the screen 
changes slightly: A square appears onscreen, or a check mark appears on 
your selected item. Lift your finger, and more options appear, just as if you’d 
right-clicked the item with your mouse.
	 	
Example: Press and hold your finger on a blank portion of the Windows desk­
top. When the square appears, lift your finger; a menu appears, letting you 
choose your desktop’s settings.
Pinch and/or stretch
A handy way to zoom in or out of a photo or website, pinch the screen 
between two fingertips (usually your thumb and index finger). The photo, 
text, or window shrinks as your fingers move inward. (Lift your fingers when 
you’ve found the right size.)
To enlarge something, spread your two fingers across the screen. As your fin­
gers spread, the object beneath them grows along with their movements.
	 	
Example: Stretch your fingers across hard-to-read items such as web pages, 
photos, and documents until they reach a suitable level of size or detail. 
Pinch them to reduce their size and to fit more of them onto the screen.

80
Part I: Introductions 
Rotate
Press and hold the screen with two fingers and then rotate your fingers. The 
item turns as if it were paper on a table.
	 	
Example: When viewing maps or photos, rotating your two fingers repositions 
them according to your fingers’ movements.
Slide
Press your finger against the screen and then, without lifting your finger, slide 
your finger across the glass. When you lift your finger, the item stays in its 
new location.
	 	
Example: To reposition a window across the desktop, press your finger on the 
window’s Title bar — that colored strip along its top edge. Slide your finger to 
the window’s desired position and then lift your finger to drop the window in 
its new place.
Swipe
A swipe is a short slide. For example, slide the finger a short distance in a 
certain direction, usually inward from one of the screen’s edges. You’ll con­
stantly find yourself swiping inward from your Surface’s edges because that 
summons hidden menus.
	 	
www.it-ebooks.info

81
 Chapter 5: Typing, Touching, and Drawing on the Surface
Example: Swipe across a digital book to turn its pages. Swipe across a web 
browser’s screen to scroll up or down a web page. Swipe across the Start 
menu to see tiles hidden along the left or right edges. Swiping almost always 
seems natural, like you were flipping a magazine’s pages.
Note: You can sometimes swipe to select items. To do that, swipe in the 
opposite direction the item usually moves. For example, you normally swipe 
downward on your list of e-mail to scroll through the subjects. So, to select a 
particular piece of e-mail, swipe it sideways and release. Windows highlights 
the e-mail and adds an adjacent check mark, meaning you’ve selected it for 
further action. (I describe the Mail app in Chapter 9.)
Typing with the Click-On Covers
Part of the Surface’s attraction comes from its detachable keyboard, which 
doubles as a screen cover. Thin and lightweight, the keyboard clicks onto the 
Surface with magnets. The connectors also let the keyboard draw power from 
the Surface, so it doesn’t need batteries.
After you attach the keyboard, you can fold it in different directions to handle 
different tasks:
	
✓	Fold the keyboard down flat on a table, and you’re ready to type. (Flip 
your Surface’s kickstand back to keep it upright.)
	
✓	Fold the keyboard up to protect the screen, and you’re ready to travel. 
(The Surface automatically goes to sleep.)
	
✓	Fold the keyboard around the back of your Surface, and it’s out of the 
way, letting you control the Surface with your fingers. (The keyboard 
automatically turns off.)
A sensor embedded in the keyboard lets the Surface know its position so it 
can behave correctly. When flat on the table, the keyboard turns on, ready 
for you to type. When folded back behind the screen, the keyboard turns 
off. And when you close the keyboard, the Surface goes to sleep to preserve 
battery life.
Both the Touch and Type Cover keyboards also include a thin trackpad that 
lets you control a mouse pointer, clicking, double-clicking, and right-clicking.
The two keyboards both offer the usual typewriter keys, Function keys, and 
dedicated keys that bring up the Charms bar icons, mute the volume, and 
pause or resume your music and video.

82
Part I: Introductions 
	
When you attach either keyboard, the screen’s rotation lock automatically 
kicks in, keeping your Surface locked in landscape mode: The screen no longer 
rotates. Fold the keyboard behind the screen, and the rotation lock turns off, 
letting the screen rotate “right-side up” as you carry it around.
The following sections describe how the covers differ and how to best put 
them to work.
Typing on the Touch Cover keyboard
The Touch Cover keyboard cover lacks mechanical keys. But its pressure-
sensitive keys, shown in Figure 5-1, work surprisingly well. A mere touch 
won’t trigger the keys, so you can rest your fingers on the keys without 
typing. But when you start tapping on the keys, the keyboard translates 
your taps into typing.
The Type Cover 2 and Touch Cover 2 keyboards
With the arrival of the Surface 2 and Surface 
Pro 2, Microsoft released updated snap-on key­
boards: the Type Cover 2 and Touch Cover 2. For 
the most part, they’re identical to their counter­
parts, the Type and Touch Cover keyboards. 
They have the same number of keys, and the 
same layout.
The two new keyboards differ from their older 
cousins in these main ways:
	✓	Cost: They’re more expensive than the older 
keyboards, especially now that that the 
old keyboards have been marked down in 
stores.
	✓	Back-lighting: When attached, a glow rises 
from below the keys, making them easier to 
see in the dark.
	✓	Size: Both keyboards are a tiny bit thinner 
than their older counterparts. On the Type 
Cover 2 keyboard, the keys don’t travel 
down as far, increasing your typing speed.
	✓	Function keys: The first generation key­
boards included dedicated keys for rais­
ing or lowering the volume. The Touch 
Cover 2 and Type Cover 2 keyboards now 
make those F1 and F2 keys raise or lower 
the screen brightness. Also, the first Touch 
Cover keyboard didn’t label its Function 
keys; the Touch Cover 2 keyboard adds the 
labels.
	✓	Sensitivity: The Touch Cover 2 keyboard 
includes more sensors, making for more 
accurate typing.
	✓	Trackpad: The trackpad on both new key­
boards is a little wider.
Other than those differences, all four keyboards 
are almost identical; every keyboard works with 
every Surface model.
So, to keep things simple, I refer to both the new 
and old keyboards as simply Touch and Type 
Cover keyboards.

 Chapter 5: Typing, Touching, and Drawing on the Surface
Figure 5-1:

Touch Cover 
and Touch 
Cover 2 key-
boards don’t

The Touch Cover keyboard feels almost like fabric or cardboard more than a 
keyboard, and typing on it is an eerie feeling at first. You can start typing on 
it immediately with good results, but your speed won’t pick up until you’ve 
used it for a few days.
Don’t try to type too quickly — you’ll need to grow used to typing without 
feeling anything in response. But after you grow used to it, you’ll find it faster 
than the onscreen keyboard. And unlike the onscreen keyboard, it doesn’t fill 
half your screen.
	
Basically, the Touch Cover keyboard works much like any other keyboard, but 
these tips will save you some time:
	
✓	The F and J keys have slight indentations on them to help you position 
your fingers correctly. Feel for them with your index fingers, and your 
other fingers will stay aligned more correctly.
	
✓	The Touch Cover keyboard isn’t waterproof enough to toss into the dish­
washer, but a damp rag removes most spills.
	
✓	The 12 dedicated keys across the keyboard’s top edge double as Function 
keys. To turn a Function key into a dedicated key, hold down the Fn key 
while pressing it. (The Fn key is to the right of the space bar.)
	
✓	The first Touch Cover keyboard didn’t label its Function keys, so you 
need to remember which one is which; the Touch Cover 2 includes the 
labels, thankfully.
www.it-ebooks.info

84
Part I: Introductions 
	
✓	On the first Touch Cover keyboard, the trackpad’s left- and right-click 
buttons are just beneath the trackpad, separated by the little vertical 
line. On the Touch Cover 2 keyboard, those buttons are along the bottom 
of the trackpad rather than beneath it.
	
✓	If the mouse pointer or cursor disappears while you use the scroll pad, 
detach the keyboard, wait a few seconds, and reattach it. The pointer or 
cursor should reappear.
	
✓	The Touch Cover keyboard comes in different colors: black, white, 
purple, cyan, and magenta. (Not every country carries every color.) 
And no, snapping a colored keyboard onto your Surface won’t automati­
cally change your screen’s background color to match. (I explain how to 
change your background color manually in Chapter 14.)
Typing on the Type Cover keyboard
The Surface’s Type Cover keyboard, shown in Figure 5-2, contains mechani­
cal keys. Designed for people who prefer movable keys, this makes the key­
board slightly thicker than the Touch Cover keyboard, a compromise readily 
accepted by many touch typists.
Figure 5-2:

and Type 
Cover 2

keys that

 Chapter 5: Typing, Touching, and Drawing on the Surface
	
The Type Cover keyboard outweighs the Touch Cover by less than an ounce 
and costs only a few dollars more. If you feel hesitant about the immobile 
Touch Cover, opt for the Type Cover keyboard.
In addition to its movable keys, the Type Cover keyboard differs from the 
Touch Cover keyboard in a few other ways:
	
✓	Both the Type Cover and Type Cover 2 keyboards include labels on their 
Function keys.
	
✓	The F and J keys have standard bumps rather than indentations to help 
you position your fingers.
Using Surface trackpad gestures
Both the Touch and the Type Cover keyboards include a trackpad below 
the keys. Chances are good that you won’t use it much: It’s usually easier to 
touch the screen to do what you want.
However, it comes in handy if you spend much time on the desktop. There, 
the trackpad controls your mouse pointer, bringing the pinpoint precision 
needed to navigate the desktop’s crowded menus.
Table 5-1 explains how to mimic mouse clicks, drags, and scrolls with your 
Surface’s trackpad.

86
Part I: Introductions 
	
Pay particular attention to these tips, which work equally well on both the 
Touch and Type Cover keyboard’s trackpads:
	
✓	When reading a website or browsing an app like the News app, put two 
fingers on the trackpad and then slide them back and forth or up or 
down, depending on how the page flows. That sometimes scrolls the 
page more smoothly than touching the screen with your fingers.
	
✓	Tapping with two fingers brings up the right-screen menu on the desk­
top. That’s often faster and easier than right-clicking by tapping on the 
trackpad.
	
✓	The Touch Cover 2 and Type Cover 2 covers also let you pinch and 
zoom with two fingers on the trackpad. Also, swiping in from the left or 
right sides of the trackpad mimics doing the same on the screen. (That 
lets you fetch the Charms bar or see the currently open applications.)
	
✓	Tapping with two fingers quickly brings up an App’s menu. But because 
you still need to tap the menu item with a finger or well-placed mouse 
click, it rarely saves time.
Typing on the Onscreen Keyboard
Your Surface isn’t really complete without a Touch or Type Cover keyboard. 
Combined with the Surface’s built-in kickstand, a keyboard cover transforms 
your Surface into a desktop PC whenever you sit down.
But whether or not you own a keyboard, this section describes how to use 
the free keyboard built into every Surface: the onscreen keyboard, also called 
the virtual or glass keyboard.
Typing on glass has its challenges. First, the keyboard covers the bottom half 
of your screen, hiding half of your workspace. Second, you can’t feel whether 
you’ve hit the right key.
On the positive side, each key clicks and lights up when tapped, offering 
positive reinforcement that you’ve hit the right one. And your Surface auto­
corrects fairly well; when your fumbling fingers type thw, your Surface auto­
matically corrects the word to the.
The onscreen keyboard will never outperform a real keyboard for speed. But 
with practice, your typing speed will improve. The following sections help 
you make the most out of the keyboard built into every Surface tablet.
	
Don’t like the autocorrect feature? I explain how to both tweak and disable it 
in Chapter 14. (Look for the Typing section in the PCs and Devices area of PC 
Settings.)

 Chapter 5: Typing, Touching, and Drawing on the Surface
Summoning the onscreen keyboard
If you’ve attached your Touch or Type Cover keyboards, the onscreen key­
board stays hidden. But when your keyboard is detached or folded behind 
your Surface, the onscreen keyboard is ready for action.
In fact, the onscreen keyboard pops up automatically when you stay on the 
Start screen side of things. Tap inside the Charms bar’s Search box, for exam­
ple, or inside an app that accepts text.
As you tap, the onscreen keyboard automatically fills the screen’s bottom 
half, shown in Figure 5-3, ready for you to begin typing.
Figure 5-3: 
While work-
ing within a 
Start screen 
app, tap 
where you’d 
like to type, 
and the

	 The Windows desktop isn’t as friendly, unfortunately; tapping in a text box 
doesn’t automatically summon the onscreen keyboard. You must manually 
summon the keyboard by tapping the desktop’s keyboard icon (shown in the 
margin) on the taskbar along the bottom edge.
The keyboard looks and behaves much like a real keyboard, with many of 
the same keys. Position your fingers over the keys the best you can and start 
typing. As you type, the letters appear onscreen.

Part I: Introductions 
	
Typing on glass is completely foreign to many people, and it’s an oddly unset­
tling experience. Try these tips when typing for the first few days:
	
✓	Tap the Shift key to type an uppercase letter. (The Shift key automati­
cally turns off after you’ve typed that first letter.) To turn on the Shift 
Lock, tap the Shift key twice. When you’re through typing uppercase let­
ters, tap the Shift key again to turn off Shift Lock.
	
✓	If you’re accustomed to pressing keyboard commands like Ctrl+V for 
Paste, press the Ctrl key, and some of the keyboard’s keys will change. 
The word Paste appears on the V key, for example. Other keys sprout 
labels, as well, letting you know which key you need to press to Select 
All, Undo, Cut, Copy, or Paste.
	
	
✓	Need a numeric keypad? Press the &123 key in the bottom-left corner, 
and the keypad appears, along with a Tab key and the brackets and sym­
bols usually found on most keyboards’ top row.
	
	
✓	When you’re through typing, press Enter, and the keyboard enters your 
text and disappears. If you called up the keyboard mistakenly, just 
tap anyplace away from the text box to remove the keyboard. Or, tap 
the Keyboard icon (shown in the margin) in the screen’s bottom-right 
corner; when the pop-up menu appears, press the keyboard icon with 
the downward-pointing arrow beneath it.
	
✓	On the desktop, the pop-up keyboard has a little X in its upper-right 
corner, like all the other windows. Click or tap the little X, and the key­
board disappears.
Typing on the Start screen without 
an attached keyboard
To search for files, apps, or settings on your com­
puter, you can type directly into the Start screen 
itself: The Charms bar’s Search box automati­
cally appears to accept your keystrokes.
Typing directly into the Start screen is easy 
when you’ve attached a keyboard. But what 
if you’re simply holding your Surface, with no 
keyboard attached?
You can fetch the onscreen keyboard at any 
time by following these steps:
	 1.	 Summon the Charms bar by sliding your 
finger inward from the screen’s right edge.
	 2.	 When the Charms bar appears, tap the 
Settings icon.
	 3.	 When the Settings pane appears, tap the 
Keyboard icon in the bottom-right corner.
	 4.	 When the Keyboard icon pop-up appears, 
tap the words Touch Keyboard and 
Handwriting Panel.
The onscreen keyboard rises from the bottom of 
the Start screen, ready for you to type the name 
of your sought-after item, be it a file, a setting, 
an app, or something on the Internet.

Switching between the different 
onscreen keyboards
The onscreen keyboard normally looks like the one shown earlier in 
Figure 5-3. But the onscreen keyboard can morph into several other key­
boards, as well.
	
	 To switch to a different keyboard, press the Switch Keyboards button in the 
onscreen keyboard’s bottom-right corner. A pop-up menu lets you choose 
among your Surface’s different keyboards, shown in Figure 5-4. (If you install 
keyboard layouts from other languages, those other layouts also appear.)

I explain your other keyboard choices in the next three sections.
Typing with the Thumb keyboard
Built for a generation raised on smartphones, the Thumb keyboard lets you 
hold your Surface vertically, like a giant phone. Shown in Figure 5-5, the key­
board appears split into three sections, each clinging to a bottom edge.
Your thumbs can then poke at the letters while typing, letting you whip out 
e-mails beneath the dinner table at family gatherings.

	 Adjust the Thumb keyboard for different-sized thumbs by holding down the 
three dots (shown in the margin) near the keyboard’s left side. A pop-up 
appears, letting you slide your thumb over the words Small, Medium, and 
Large. As your thumb slides, the keyboard reshapes itself to the new size. 
When you’re satisfied, lift your thumb to lock in the new setting.
Writing on the Handwriting panel
Your Surface also recognizes your handwriting, translating it into text as you 
write on the screen. To write on the screen, choose the Handwriting panel. 
Writing or drawing on the panel requires a stylus — a type of pen with a spe­
cial plastic tip.
	
The Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 include a stylus, but the Surface RT and 
Surface 2 don’t. However, any capacitive stylus (the cheap kind) works on 
those models. I explain how to use a stylus on the Handwriting panel in this 
chapter’s “Drawing and Writing with a Stylus” section.
Adding a Standard keyboard layout
If you need a full-sized, standard keyboard, complete with numbers and 
Function keys across the top, choose the Standard keyboard. Shown in 
Figure 5-6, it’s the real deal, complete with the Windows key, the Alt key, and 
even four arrow keys for navigating menus.

However, the Standard keyboard is normally turned off. To add it as an option 
on the keyboard menu, follow these steps:
	
1.	Slide your finger inward from the screen’s right edge to summon the 
Charms bar and then tap Settings.
	
	
2.	 When the Settings pane appears, tap Change PC Settings from its 
bottom edge.
	
3.	When the PC Settings screen appears, tap the PC and Devices 
category.
	
4.	When the PC and Devices screen appears, tap the Typing category.
	
5.	Tap the On toggle switch next to the last option, which is labeled Add 
the Standard Keyboard Layout as a Touch Keyboard.
The Standard keyboard then appears as a keyboard option along with the 
other three.
	
The Standard keyboard doesn’t include a PrintScreen key. To take a screen­
shot on your Surface, hold down the Windows key on the Surface’s front and 
press the Volume Down switch in your Surface’s upper-left corner. The screen­
shot appears as a PNG file in your Pictures library’s Screenshots folder.
Typing special characters
Your Surface’s onscreen keyboard simplifies typing symbols and foreign char­
acters, something quite difficult on other keyboards, including the Surface’s 
Type and Touch Cover keyboards.
To add the little accent mark on the letter é, for example, press and hold the 
onscreen keyboard’s e key. A little pop-up appears around the letter, shown 
in Figure 5-7, showing possible foreign characters based on the e key. Slide 
your finger in the direction of the key you want and let go. The desired char­
acter appears.
	
Holding down the question mark key lets you choose among eight other 
common symbols missing from the keyboard, including brackets, hyphens, 
slashes, ampersand, and the exclamation point.
	
	 Press the &123 key to bring up a Numeric keypad and mathematical symbols. 
When the Numeric keypad appears, press the arrow keys directly above the 
&123 key to toggle between even more characters, including symbols for 
copyright, advanced mathematics, and popular currencies.

Typing smileys (emoticons)
Whether they’re called smileys, emoticons, or emoji, these little characters 
grew from the simple smiley face created from a colon, a dash, and a right 
parenthesis — :-).
	
	 Your Surface embraces the smiley tradition by supporting dozens of emoti­
cons. To insert an emoticon, press the smiley key shown in the margin. The

The Emoticon keyboard begins by showing the smiley faces shown in 
Figure 5-8. To see more, press any of the keys along the bottom. There, you 
can choose among other symbol categories: Holiday, Food, Travel, Weather, 
Miscellaneous, and Text. (The Text category is a quick way to add text-based 
smiley faces when sending text-based e-mail.)
Unfortunately, emoticons don’t translate well between different programs, 
computers, and e-mail systems. They’ll work most reliably if you’re sending 
them between computers running Windows 8 or 8.1.
However, if you’re sending them to somebody using a different operating 
system, stick with the Text emoticon category, which lets you insert the 
always-compatible text-based smileys — :-).
	
Emoticons are resizable, so they work well as clipart when creating flyers and 
newsletters. After you insert them into your document, enlarge their font size 
until they’re the size you need.
Predictive typing
As you type in some apps, Windows watches over your shoulder and tries to 
predict your next word. If Windows feels particularly prescient, it lists words 
beneath your cursor, as shown in Figure 5-9.
Figure 5-9: 
If Windows 
guesses 
your 
intended 
word cor-
rectly, 
tap it, and 
Windows 
fills in the 
rest of your 
word.

Part I: Introductions 
If Windows has guessed correctly, tap the word, and Windows quickly fin­
ishes typing it. If you notice that Windows has guessed incorrectly, simply 
ignore it and breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that computers won’t be smart 
enough to overthrow us within our lifetimes.
The prediction accuracy rate differs for different people; teenagers type more 
predictably than scientists, for example. Your Surface will never guess cor­
rectly 100 percent of the time. But when Windows offers to fill in the word 
serendipity after you type seren, the help is quite welcome, especially when 
you’re typing directly onto the screen.
The Windows keyboard also changes its key layout as you type in different 
situations, adding particularly handy keys:
	
✓	When you begin typing a web address into Internet Explorer, a .COM 
key appears to the right of the spacebar. Tap that to insert .COM, saving 
you from typing in those four characters. (A backslash key appears right 
next to it, handy when typing long web addresses.)
	
✓	Tap and hold the .COM key, and a pop-up menu appears, letting you 
choose to insert the .us, .net, or .org characters, instead.
	
✓	When you type an e-mail address into the Mail app, the keyboard 
sprouts the .COM key, as well as the @ key, speeding up your e-mail 
address entry.
	
✓	Typing a logon password? If strangers are nearby, tap the keyboard’s 
Hide Keypress key that appears just to the left of the spacebar. That pre­
vents the keys from lighting up when tapped, protecting your password 
from prying eyes.
Editing text on a touchscreen
Without the pinpoint precision of a mouse pointer, editing a few lines of text 
seems insurmountable. How do you place the cursor in the exact location 
necessary to excise the unwanted text?
Like nearly anything else on your Surface, it starts with a strategically 
placed tap.
Double-tap a word near where you want to edit. Windows highlights the 
word, surrounding it with a small marker on each side. To extend the selec­
tion, drag the first marker to the selection’s beginning; drag the second 
marker to the section’s end, as shown in Figure 5-10.

 Chapter 5: Typing, Touching, and Drawing on the Surface
Figure 5-10: 
Tap a word, 
then drag 
the markers 
to surround 
the portion 
you’d like to 
delete.
Some apps and programs differ in how they treat a tap of your finger:
	
✓	Sometimes double-tapping a word highlights it but doesn’t place the 
markers on each side. If this happens, hold down the Shift key: As you 
slide your finger, Windows highlights adjacent words. When you’ve high­
lighted the unwanted words, lift your finger and press Delete to delete 
them.
	
✓	Sometimes a tap simply places a cursor on the screen, which is handy 
when you need to position the cursor in just the right spot. When the 
cursor appears, drag it to the right or left until it’s at the position where 
you’d like to begin typing.
	
✓	Having trouble putting the cursor where you want it? Try zooming in 
with your fingers: Straddle the words with your fingertips and then 
spread your fingers. In many programs, the text increases in size, making 
it much easier to touch exactly where you want to begin typing or 
editing.
	
✓	If your Surface came with a stylus, keep it handy. You can quickly and 
easily mark text for changes by drawing over it with your stylus, much 
like using a highlighter.
Typing on a Detachable Keyboard
Not everybody has a Surface Touch or Type Cover keyboard. (They’re very 
cool but more than a little pricey.) Luckily, every Surface model works with a 
variety of other keyboards.
www.it-ebooks.info

96
Part I: Introductions 
The Surface Pro models will work with any type of detachable keyboard. 
The Surface RT and Surface 2 work well only with these types of detachable 
keyboards:
	
✓	USB: Because every Surface includes a USB port, it works with USB key­
boards commonly found on desktop PCs. USB keyboards work on the 
Surface RT and Surface 2, as well, but only if the keyboards don’t require 
special software. (Many gaming keyboards do, unfortunately.)
	
✓	Bluetooth: Every Surface includes Bluetooth, a common way of connect­
ing a wireless keyboard. I explain how to attach Bluetooth gadgets in 
Chapter 6. (Most iPad keyboards use Bluetooth, so most iPad keyboards 
also work on a Surface.)
When looking for a keyboard for your Surface, look for one designed with 
Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 in mind. Those usually include dedicated keys for 
the Charms bar.
Drawing and Writing with a Stylus
When Microsoft released its first tablets a decade ago, the company thought 
people would treat them as digital notepads: Doctors would carry them from 
room to room, scribbling notes, consulting charts, and viewing x-rays taken 
minutes before. That dream never quite caught on.
Instead, people today think of tablets as easy ways to watch movies, read 
books, or browse websites. Yet, all of Microsoft’s pioneering “digital notepad” 
work isn’t lost. Your Surface still accepts your handwriting when you draw on 
it with a stylus — a specially designed, plastic-tipped pen.
As you write in either cursive or block letters, your Surface recognizes your 
scrawls, automatically converting your word into text. In some programs, 
Windows saves your handwritten text but indexes it. That not only makes 
your notes easy to relocate but also preserves any drawings you’ve added 
along with the text, a handy perk for Chemistry students.
These sections explain how to turn your expensive Surface into a pad of paper.
Opening the Handwriting panel
Because all models of Surface accept a stylus, you can write by hand any­
where that Windows accepts typing. You can handwrite a letter in Microsoft 
Word, for example, or write the name of a newly created folder.
As you write, Windows converts your handwriting to words and drops them 
into the appropriate place.

 Chapter 5: Typing, Touching, and Drawing on the Surface
The key is to call up the Handwriting panel by following these steps:
	
1.	Tap where you’d like to enter text.
	
	 Tap any place that accepts text — an e-mail, a Word document, an entry 
in a calendar, or even the name of a new file you’re saving.
	
	
	 If the keyboard doesn’t appear (it doesn’t appear automatically on the 
desktop), summon it by tapping the taskbar’s keyboard icon, shown in 
the margin.
	
	
2.	 If a keyboard doesn’t display its Handwriting panel, tap the keyboard 
switching key and tap the Stylus option, shown in the margin.
	
	 The Handwriting panel appears.
	
3.	Begin writing in the Handwriting panel, in cursive, block letters, or a 
combination.
	
	 As you write, Windows quickly begins recognizing the separate words, 
listing them in order along the panel’s left edge. After you’ve written a 
short phrase, tap the Insert button. Windows inserts the words as text, 
shown in Figure 5-11.
Figure 5-11: 
Tap the 
Insert 
button to 
insert your 
recognized 
words as 
text.
	
	 If all goes according to plan, you’ll write your words, insert them, and move 
on. To bring yourself up to speed, tap the little question mark inside the 
rectangle (shown in the margin). Tiny visual tutorials show how to correct, 
delete, split, and join handwritten words.
	
✓	After you call up the Handwriting panel, it automatically appears as 
your preferred keyboard until you manually choose a different type of 
keyboard.
www.it-ebooks.info

98
Part I: Introductions 
	
✓	The Surface RT and Surface 2 require a capacitive stylus, the inexpensive 
type of stylus sold nearly anywhere. The ones sold for an iPad work fine.
	
✓	The Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 include a bundled digitizer stylus. 
More expensive than the capacitive stylus, the digitizer stylus allows 
finer, pressure-sensitive control when drawing. Those Surface models 
also include a special screen with palm-blocking technology that makes 
it easier to take notes.
	
✓	Both types of styli work also in drawing programs.
Correcting handwritten mistakes
A mistake will inevitably creep onto the Handwriting panel. It won’t recognize 
one of your words correctly, for example, or it will turn an inadvertent key­
stroke into a period.
To correct mistakes in the Handwriting panel before you’ve touched the 
Insert button, draw a strikeout line through the misspelled words, word, or 
letters, as shown in Figure 5-12. When you lift the pen, the unwanted word 
disappears.
Calibrating your stylus
Handwriting recognition works quite well in 
the Surface, perhaps because Microsoft has 
been perfecting it since its introduction in 1992. 
However, to make Windows recognize your 
writing style the most accurately, calibrate it: 
Let Windows watch as you tap a set of cross­
hairs on the screen. Windows compares your 
onscreen touch with the actual location of the 
crosshairs and behaves more accurately.
To calibrate your tablet, follow these steps:
	 1.	 From the Desktop, swipe in from your tab­
let’s right edge to fetch the Charms bar; 
then tap the Settings icon.
	 2.	 From the Settings pane, choose Control 
Panel at the top.
	
	 The Control Panel appears.
	 3.	 Tap the Hardware and Sound category; 
then tap the Tablet PC Settings section.
	 4.	 From the Tablet PC Settings window, tap 
the Calibrate button.
	 5.	 Follow the instructions, repeatedly tapping 
the onscreen crosshairs; then tap the Yes 
button to save the data.
Windows saves your calibration data, tracking 
the touch of your stylus that much more accu­
rately. Feel free to repeat these steps anytime 
you feel Windows doesn’t correctly recognize 
your stylus.

Spot a mistake in text that’s already entered? Then run your stylus over the 
text that needs correcting, just as though you were highlighting it with a 
marker. As you highlight the text, it appears in the Handwriting panel for edit­
ing, as though you’d just written it by hand.
When the text appears in the Handwriting panel, draw a line through the 
words you’d like to remove, just as though you’d written them there, and the 
unwanted words disappear. Then tap the Insert key to put the corrected ver­
sion back in place.
You can correct mistakes several other ways inside the Handwriting panel:
	
✓	To correct a single letter within a word in the Handwriting panel, tap the 
word. Windows spaces the word out, letter by letter. Write the correct 
letter over the incorrect letter, and Windows replaces the wrong letter 
with the newly corrected letter.
	
	
✓	To add a symbol, tap in your document where the symbol should appear. 
When the Handwriting panel appears, tap the &123 key (shown in the 
margin). Tap it to see the available symbols and then tap the one you’d 
like to place into the document.
	
	
✓	For more tips on how to correct items in the Handwriting panel, tap the 
question mark icon (shown in the margin) in the Handwriting panel’s 
upper-right corner. Detailed animations show exactly how to correct, 
delete, split, and join letters and words.

our Surface tablet strips computing down to the bare essentials: Your 
most important files, a screen, and your fingers to control it all. You end 
up carrying a package weighing less than two pounds.
Yet your Surface can still adapt to meet your needs. Need to leave a paper 
trail? Plug in a printer. The Surface Pros automatically recognize most of 
them; the Surface RT and Surface 2 recognize many.
Need to crank out some Excel spreadsheets or a Word document but don’t 
have a Surface keyboard? Plug in a desktop PC mouse and keyboard and fire 
up the Desktop app. Screen too small? Plug in an external monitor.
Need more storage space? Slip in a memory card, plug in a flash drive, or 
even attach a portable hard drive. The list goes on: To watch high-definition 
movies in style, plug in an HDTV.
When you’re through with all the accessories, unplug them and walk away. 
You’ve returned to minimalist mode, carrying all of your data with you.
That’s the beauty of a Surface tablet.

Part II: Connections 
Connecting to the Internet
Windows lives and breathes through the Internet, and if you’re not con­
nected, your programs will start to complain. Some Internet-starved pro­
grams send scolding messages like “You’re Not Connected.” Other apps 
simply freeze, hoping you’ll notice the tiny word Offline in their upper-right 
corners.
All Surface tablets connect to the Internet wirelessly — they already contain 
a built-in wireless network adapter. To connect, you and your Surface need 
only be within range of a wireless network.
Today, that’s easier than ever. You can find Wi-Fi networks — sometimes 
called hotspots — waiting for you in airports, coffee shops, hotels, and many 
homes. (I describe how to set up your own home’s wireless network in 
Windows 8.1 For Dummies.)
These steps explain how to know when you’re within range of a Wi-Fi net­
work, as well as how to connect to it and start browsing the Internet:
	
1.	From any screen, summon the Charms bar by sliding your finger 
inward from the screen’s right edge.
	
	 When the Charms bar appears along the screen’s right edge, look at the 
dark rectangle that appears near the screen’s bottom left. A glance at 
the icon in the rectangle’s upper-left corner, shown in Figure 6-1, shows 
when you’re within range of a wireless network.
	
	 If you’re within range, move to Step 2. Not within range? Move to 
another spot, probably the place where clusters of people huddle over 
their tablets and laptops.
	
Figure 6-1: 
When you 
summon the 
Charms bar, 
this icon lets 
you know 
whether 
you’re 
within range 
of a Wi-Fi 
signal.

105
 Chapter 6: Connecting to the Internet, Printers, Monitors, Storage, and More
	
	
2.	 Tap the Charms bar’s Settings icon. When the Settings pane appears, 
tap the Network icon.
	
	 The bottom of the Settings pane, shown in Figure 6-2, shows six icons. 
The icon in the top left represents networks. The icon toggles between 
Available and Unavailable depending on whether you’re currently within 
range of a wireless network.
	
 
• Available: When the icon says Available (shown in the margin), 
you’re within range of a wireless network. Move to Step 3 to begin 
connecting.
	
 
• Unavailable: When the icon says Unavailable (shown in the 
margin), you’re out of range and out of luck. (Wi-Fi signals rarely 
reach more than 300 feet from their transmitter.) Try moving to a 
different location or ask somebody whether a Wi-Fi signal is avail­
able. Then return to Step 1.
Figure 6-2: 
To connect, 
tap the 
wireless 
network 
available 
icon in the 
bottom top-
left corner.
	
3.	Tap the Available icon if it’s present.
	
	 The Settings pane turns into the Networks pane, shown in Figure 6-3, 
listing the names of all the wireless networks around you. Depending on 
your location, you may see several listed. Windows ranks the wireless 
networks by signal strength, placing the strongest (and usually closest) 
network atop the list.
	
	 A wireless network’s name is known as its SSID (Service Set Identification). 
The SSID represents the name that you (or the network’s owner) chose 
when originally setting up the wireless network.

Figure 6-3: 
Your 
Surface lists

network, tap 
its name.
	
4.	Tap the name of the network you’d like to connect to and tap the 
Connect button that appears.
	
	 If you’ll be connecting to this network frequently, select the Connect 
Automatically check box before tapping the Connect button, both shown 
in Figure 6-4. That tells your tablet to connect automatically whenever 
you’re within range, a convenience you’ll enjoy in your home, office, or 
favorite coffee shops.
	
	 If Windows connects to the network, you’ve finished: You’ve connected 
to an open network, meaning it’s unsecured and requires no password.
	
	 Don’t do any shopping or banking on an unsecured network. Unscrupulous 
bystanders can snoop on your connection to discover your username and 
passwords as you sign into websites.
	
	 If Windows asks you to enter a password, however, move to Step 5.
	
5.	Enter the password for the wireless network and tap the Next button.
	
	 If Windows asks you to Enter the Network Security Key when you tap the 
Connect button, you’re trying to connect with a secured, or password-
protected, network. So, you must type the network’s password, shown in 
Figure 6-5.
	
	 If you’re in your own home, here’s where you type the password you cre­
ated when setting up your wireless network. (On some wireless routers, 
you can simply press a button on the router at this point. That proves 
you’re in the same room and not trying to break in from outside.)

	 If you’re connecting to somebody else’s wireless network, you need to 
ask the network’s owner for the password (or whisper “What’s the Wi-Fi 
password?” to the person next to you at the coffee shop).
	
	 Windows hides the password as you type it, keeping it secure from 
nearby eyes. Think you’ve made a typo? Then tap and hold the eyeball 
icon on the right side of the password field, shown in Figure 6-5, and 
Windows displays your password. (That handy eyeball icon appears 
whenever you type hidden passwords into a Start screen app.)

6.	If asked, choose whether you want to share your Surface’s files on the 
network and search for other networked devices such as PCs, TVs, 
and printers.
	
	 How you handle this important choice, shown in Figure 6-6, depends on 
whether you’re connecting in a private or public location:
 
• Yes: If you’re in a private setting, such as your home or office, tap 
Yes. That lets you connect with networked printers and swap files 
with other people on the network.
 
• No: If you’re in a public place, such as a hotel or coffee shop, tap 
No because you don’t want strangers to access your files. That lets 
you access the Internet but keeps other people on the network 
away from your files.
Figure 6-6: 
Turn on 
sharing only 
if you’re 
connecting 
to your own 
network.
When you finish the steps, Windows connects to the network, and your 
Internet connection begins flowing into your Surface. If the Internet connec­
tion remains dry, however, try these tricks:
	
✓	Move closer to the transmitter. This often-difficult maneuver cures 
90  percent of Wi-Fi connection problems. Ask somebody where the Wi-Fi 
transmitter is located, or look around the room for a small plastic box 
with two or three pencil-sized antennas sticking up from it. (They’re 
often mounted on walls or atop cabinets.)
	
✓	Try connecting to an unsecured network. Such networks are fine for 
casual browsing.
www.it-ebooks.info

109
 Chapter 6: Connecting to the Internet, Printers, Monitors, Storage, and More
	
	
✓	You can also connect to a wireless network from the Windows desk­
top. When the taskbar’s right corner shows a wireless network available 
icon (shown in the margin), tap it. That takes you to Step 4 in the previ­
ous list for you to choose a network and tap the Connect button.
	
	Only have wired network access? You can buy an USB-to-Ethernet adapter 
from the Microsoft Store. (The adapter works on all four Surface models.)
	
	To disconnect from a wireless network, simply walk out of range; 
Windows disconnects automatically. Or, if you want to disconnect while 
still in range, summon the Charms bar, tap the Settings icon, tap the 
Network icon, tap the network’s name, and tap the Disconnect button.
Connecting to Networked PCs
Your Surface’s hard drive may always seem too small, at least by desktop PC 
standards. Because you probably can’t fit all of your information onto your 
Surface, keep an eye out for other places to stash files, storing a few videos in 
one spot and a few music files someplace else.
One of the easiest places to stash your files might be on your home or office 
network. To browse the files on those huge-hard-drive-stuffed PCs, you first 
need to connect to their wireless network.
To connect to PCs on a home or office network, follow the steps in the previ­
ous section to connect to the wireless network. In the last step, though, make 
sure to tap the button labeled Yes, Turn On Sharing and Connect to Devices.
But what if you forgot to tap that Sharing and Connect button?
Disconnecting for Airplane mode
Airplane mode is shorthand for disconnect­
ing completely from the Internet. To put your 
Surface into Airplane mode before a plane 
flight, follow these steps:
	 1.	Summon the Charms bar by swiping your 
finger in from the screen’s right edge and 
then tap the Settings icon.
	 2.	When the Settings pane appears, tap the 
Network icon.
	 3.	When the Network pane appears, tap the 
Airplane Mode toggle switch along the 
pane’s top edge.
The Settings pane’s Network icon shows that 
you’re in Airplane mode. (Bluetooth wireless 
gadgets, covered later in this chapter, also stop 
working in Airplane mode.) To turn off Airplane 
mode and return to a lifestyle of searching for 
Internet connections, repeat the three steps.

You can turn it on by following these steps. These steps also let you connect 
to a homegroup — a simple way for Surface tablets, Windows 7, Windows 8, 
and Windows 8.1 computers to share files.
	
	
1.	 Summon the Charms bar by sliding your finger in from your Surface’s 
right edge and then tap the Settings icon.
	
2.	Tap the Change PC Settings link at the bottom of the Settings pane.
	
3.	When the PC Settings screen appears, tap the word Network in the left 
column and then tap your network’s name.
	
	 The Network screen appears, listing your network connections. Tap your 
connected network’s name, probably the only one listed in the Wi-Fi cat­
egory. The settings for that network appear, shown in Figure 6-7.

	 That screen offers other technical tidbits about your connection, includ­
ing your network’s SSID, protocol, type of security, and IP address. It 
also lists the type of network adapter you’re using and its driver version, 
which is handy for troubleshooting.
	
5.	Tap the Start screen’s Desktop app and then tap the File Explorer 
icon.
	
	
	 You can find the icon for File Explorer (shown in the margin) near the 
left end of the taskbar — the strip along the bottom of the desktop. 
(I cover File Explorer in Chapter 12.)

6.	When File Explorer appears, tap the word Homegroup in the 
Navigation pane that clings to every folder’s left edge.
	
	 The Homegroup window appears, shown in Figure 6-8.

Don’t know the homegroup’s password? To find it, visit any computer on your 
network’s homegroup, open any folder, and right-click the word Homegroup 
from the Navigation pane. When the pop-up menu appears, choose View 
the Homegroup Password. That’s the password you need to enter into your 
Surface. Type the password, and you’ve connected to the homegroup.
	
✓	In Step 7 in the preceding list, tapping Next at each window lets you con­
nect to the homegroup and access the contents of the Pictures, Videos, 
and Music libraries on other computers in the homegroup.
	
✓	Although the Surface RT and Surface 2 can connect to an existing home­
group and access files from those computers, they can’t create a new home­
group, nor will they let other homegroup computers access their own files.
	
✓	Unlike the Surface RT and Surface 2, the Surface Pro and Pro 2 tablets 
can share the contents of their pictures, videos, and music libraries. 
Unless the settings are changed, the Documents folder on all homegroup 
computers remains private and not shared.
	
✓	Joining a homegroup also lets you connect with many networked 
devices (usually, printers).

✓	Store things you want to share from your desktop PC in your libraries: 
Music, Pictures, and Videos. That makes them available to your Surface, 
as well as any Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 PCs on the net­
work’s homegroup.
	
✓	Although Windows Vista and Windows XP PCs can’t join homegroups, 
you can access their files from your Surface in another way. Tap the 
word Network at the bottom of any folder’s Navigation pane. The 
Network window appears, listing every networked PC. Tap any PCs name 
to open it and browse its shared files.
Connecting to a Printer
Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 tablets can connect with just about any printer 
that works with your desktop PC.
	
Surface RT and Surface 2 tablets, by contrast, are much pickier about their 
printers. They can’t run a printer’s installation software, for example. Many 
newer printers will work, but you may have trouble connecting with older 
printers.
Most printers connect either through a USB port or through a wired or wire­
less network. Here’s how to set them up:
	
✓	USB: The simplest way to connect with a USB printer is to plug the print­
er’s USB cable directly into your Surface’s USB port, and turn on your 
printer. Your Surface should recognize and install it automatically. (If you 
have a Surface Pro or Surface Pro 2, try installing the printer’s software.) 
If the printer still doesn’t work, it probably isn’t compatible with your 
Surface.
	
✓	Network and wireless: After you connect to a network, described in a 
previous section, your Surface has access to all the compatible printers 
shared on that network.
To see whether your Surface recognizes a networked printer, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Open the Charms bar by sliding your finger inward from the screen’s 
right edge.
	
	
2.	 Tap the Settings icon; when the Settings pane appears, tap the words 
Change PC Settings.
	
	 The PC Settings screen appears.

 Chapter 6: Connecting to the Internet, Printers, Monitors, Storage, and More
	
3.	Tap PCs and Devices from the PC Settings screen, and when the PCs 
and Devices screen appears, tap Devices from the left column.
	
	
	 The Devices screen shows every device attached or available to your 
Surface, including printers. They’re listed alphabetically, and available 
printers have the icon shown in the margin.
Not every Start screen app can print, and there’s no way to know if your app 
is printable until you try. So, to try and print from any Start screen app, open 
it and follow these steps:
	
	
1.	 From within any app, open the Charms bar by sliding your finger 
inward from the screen’s right edge and then tap the Devices icon.
	
	 The Devices pane appears, listing three categories: Play, Print, and 
Project.
	
2.	Tap Print.
	
	
	 The Print pane appears, listing your available printers.
	
3.	Tap the desired printer’s name and make any final adjustments.
	
	 The Start screen’s Printer window, shown in Figure 6-9, sums up exactly 
what’s going to the printer. It shows a preview and the number of pages 
required. To see all of the pages you’re printing, slide your finger across 
the preview image from right to left.
	
	 To see even more options, tap the miniscule More Settings link, right 
above the Print button. There, you can sometimes choose the type of 
printer paper you’re using, an essential step when using photo paper on 
a color printer.

4.	Tap the Print button.
	
	 Your Surface sends your information to the printer.
But the Start screen’s emphasis on speed leaves out some details:
	
✓	Many apps can’t print. You can’t print a day’s itinerary from your 
Calendar app, for example, or even a monthly calendar.
	
✓	When printing from the Start screen’s Internet Explorer app, you’re 
stuck printing the entire web page — advertisements, comments, and 
everything in between. There’s no way to print selective portions.
	
✓	If you need more control over your print jobs on a Surface Pro or Pro 2, 
head for the desktop and its cadre of more full-featured programs. Surface 
RT and Surface 2 tablets, unfortunately, don’t offer much more in the way 
of printer controls on the desktop.
	
✓	The printer listed as “Microsoft XPS Document Writer” is not a printer. 
It’s Microsoft’s way of storing information in a file, much like Adobe 
Acrobat’s PDF files. You can then share the file with others, letting 
them print it instead. (The Surface RT and Surface 2 also offer a Send 
to OneNote option, which sends the information to the OneNote note-
taking program.)
	
✓	If your Surface RT or Surface 2 tablet can’t print to a networked printer, 
try plugging the printer directly into your Surface. If the Surface recog­
nizes the printer when plugged in directly, your Surface may also recog­
nize the printer when it’s plugged back into the network.
	
✓	Stuck with a printer that’s incompatible with your Surface RT or Surface 2? 
You can copy the file to a flash drive, plug the flash drive into a desktop 
PC, and print it from there.
Connecting to Portable Accessories
After you finally sit down at a desk with your Surface, you can plug in a few 
strategic accessories to give your Surface extra powers. The following sec­
tions describe how to connect with whatever computer accessories you may 
find in your home, office, gadget bag, or even the hotel’s tiny computer room.
	
If you have a stylus for your Surface, always carry it along. The size of a pen, 
the stylus comes in really handy for tapping the desktop’s buttons, as well as 
editing text, as I describe in Chapter 5.

 Chapter 6: Connecting to the Internet, Printers, Monitors, Storage, and More
Connecting a mouse or keyboard
When you reach for your Surface’s Desktop app, you’ll probably want to 
reach for your Surface’s click-on keyboard, which I describe in Chapter 5. But 
if you don’t have a Surface keyboard, nearly any mouse and keyboard will do. 
Mice and keyboards come in two types:
	
✓	Wired: These plug straight into your USB port. In fact, any two-button 
mouse or standard keyboard also works with your Surface.
	
✓	Wireless: Both Surface tablets include Bluetooth — a way of connecting 
to nearby gadgets without wires. You can find plenty of Bluetooth mice 
and keyboards on the market.
	
When shopping for a mouse and keyboard for your Surface, keep these tips in 
mind:
	
✓	Because you may want to pack your mouse and keyboard when travel­
ing, look for flat, lightweight models. For example, Microsoft’s Surface 
Arc mouse flattens completely for storage and then curls up into a 
mouse shape when needed. (I describe portable mice and other handy 
accessories in Chapter 17.)
	
✓	Before buying a mouse or keyboard, try one out in your own hands. They’re 
highly personal items, and only you can tell whether it feels right for you.
	
✓	Choose a Bluetooth keyboard with dedicated Windows 8 or 8.1 keys, 
giving you one-key access to your Surface’s volume, Charms menu, 
brightness control, and other features.
Connecting to a USB hub
Every Surface model includes one USB port. 
Chances are good, though, you have more than 
one USB accessory. The solution is a USB hub. 
Similar to a power strip, the USB hub plugs into 
your lone USB hub and offers several more USB 
ports in exchange.
Portable hubs are inexpensive, often cost­
ing less than ten dollars. Small, flat hubs pack 
easily into your Surface’s case. Buy a hub with 
a protruding USB cable; when inadvertently 
knocked, the cable softens the impact, saving 
your Surface’s lone USB port from damage.
Choose hubs with the newer and faster USB 3.0 
ports because they work best with all Surface 
models. (The lone Surface RT lives in the slow 
lane of USB 2.0 speeds, but it can still use a 
USB 3.0 hub.)
Powered USB hubs include an AC adapter, 
so you can plug in power-hungry gadgets like 
portable DVD players. However, powered hubs 
cost more and take up more space in your 
gadget bag. They’re overkill for plugging in 
mice, keyboards, and flash drives.

Connecting Bluetooth accessories
When you’re running out of room to plug in USB accessories, Bluetooth is your 
friend. Bluetooth works much like Wi-Fi, but it specializes in connecting gad­
gets that live just a few feet apart. You can add both a Bluetooth mouse and 
Bluetooth keyboard to your Surface, leaving your USB port free for other items.
To add a Bluetooth item to your Surface, follow these steps:
	
1.	Turn on your Bluetooth device and, if necessary, make it discoverable.
	
	 Most Bluetooth devices automatically turn themselves off to save power. 
Sometimes turning it on is as simple as flipping a neatly labelled On/Off 
switch; other devices sense their own movement, automatically turning 
on and off when needed.
	
	 Making a device discoverable makes it available to be detected by a com­
puter, usually for a period of at least 30 seconds. Some devices automati­
cally become discoverable when turned on. Others make you hold down 
a button until their light begins blinking.
	
	 If you’re having trouble making your particular device discoverable, you 
may need to check its manual.
	
	
2.	 On your Surface, fetch the Charms bar by sliding your finger inward 
from the screen’s right edge. Tap the Settings icon to fetch the Settings 
pane and then tap the words Change PC Settings.
	
	 The Start screen’s PC Settings screen appears.
	
3.	Tap the PCs and Devices category and then tap Bluetooth from the left 
column.
	
	 The PC Settings’ Manage Bluetooth Devices screen appears, shown in 
Figure 6-10, and immediately begins searching for nearby Bluetooth gad­
gets in discoverable mode.
	
	 If Windows doesn’t find and list your device by name, head back to Step 1 
and make sure your Bluetooth gadget is still turned on and discoverable. 
(If it’s been longer than 30 seconds, your device may have given up.)
	
4.	When your Bluetooth device’s name appears in the Devices list, tap 
the device’s name so Windows knows to connect to it.
	
5.	Type in your device’s code if necessary and, if asked, tap the Pair button.
Everything usually works pretty smoothly until Step 5, where Bluetooth’s 
security measures kick in. Windows sometimes needs you to prove that 
you’re controlling both your Surface and your Bluetooth device, and that 
you’re not somebody sitting three rows back on the bus trying to break in.

Figure 6-10: 
When you 
see your 
Bluetooth 
gadget 
listed, tap 
its name to 
introduce 
it to your 
Surface.
To clear that security hurdle, different Bluetooth devices offer slightly dif­
ferent tactics. Sometimes you need to type a passcode — a secret string 
of numbers — into both your device and your computer. (Pull out the 
device’s manual to find the passcode.) Adding to the tension, if you don’t 
type the passcode quickly enough, both gadgets stop waiting, forcing you 
to start over.
Some Bluetooth gadgets let you press or hold in a little push button at this 
step, if you’re holding it in your hand. Some blindly accept the tapping of the 
Pair button and simply start working.
After your new gadget successfully pairs with your Surface, its name and icon 
remain in the Bluetooth category of the PC Settings screen, shown earlier in 
Figure 6-10.
	
To remove a device shown in the Bluetooth list in Figure 6-10, tap its name and 
then tap the Remove Device button that appears below its name.
Connecting a digital camera and 
importing your photos
Nobody likes viewing photos on a camera’s tiny screen. Thankfully, Windows 
makes it easy to import your camera’s photos onto your Surface, where they 
shine on the big screen. And you can do it all from the Start screen, making it 
an easy task to perform while in the field.

Part II: Connections 
Best of all, you needn’t install any of the software that came with the camera; 
Windows handles it all.
To import your camera’s photos into your Surface, follow these steps:
	
1.	Turn off your camera and then plug the camera cable’s USB connector 
into your Surface’s USB port.
	
	 Plug the small end of your camera’s cable into your camera. The cable’s 
larger end plugs into your Surface’s USB port, shown in Figure 6-11, 
found on the Surface’s right side (Surface 2 and Surface RT) or left side 
(Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2).
Figure 6-11: 
Plug the 
large end of 
your cam-
era’s cable 
into your

2.	Turn on your camera and wait for your Surface to recognize it.
	
	 Wait for a little announcement in your computer screen’s top-right 
corner. The announcement, called a toast in some manuals, lists your 
camera’s name and, if you’ve plugged in a camera for the first time, asks 
you to Tap to Choose What Happens with This Device.
	
	 Tap the announcement and then move to the next step. (If the announce­
ment disappears before you can tap it, turn off your camera, wait a 
second, and then turn it on again; the announcement reappears.)

3.	Choose how to import your photos.
	
	 The next announcement, shown in Figure 6-12, offers several options 
for how to handle your newly recognized digital camera. These three 
options always appear:
 
• Open Device to View Files: If you prefer to import your files from 
the desktop, choose this option. The desktop offers more control 
but works better with a mouse and keyboard than your fingers. This 
option fetches File Explorer (see Chapter 12), where you can manu­
ally copy the photos from the camera to a folder of your choosing.
 
• Import Photos and Videos: The easiest method, this imports your 
photos with the Start screen’s Photos app. Then move to Step 4.
 
• Take No Action: An option to avoid, this cancels the importing 
process and tells your Surface to no longer recognize your camera 
when plugged in.
	
	 After you’ve chosen an option, Windows remembers it, automatically 
taking the same route the next time you plug in your camera.

simple: It offers to import all your camera’s photos and videos into a 
folder named after the current date. To make a quick and easy transfer,

tap the Import button in the screen’s bottom-right corner to copy all the 
camera’s photos and videos onto your Surface. (You can safely unplug 
your camera from your Surface after importing your photos.)
	
	 But if you don’t want to import every photo, choose the Clear Selection 
option from the screen’s bottom menu to deselect all the photos. Then 
tap just the photos you want to import. (If you have too many photos 
to fit on one screen, scroll to the right to see the rest.) Finally, tap the 
Import button to import your selected photos.

When you tap the Import button, the Photos app imports your camera’s 
photos and videos. When the Photos app announces that it’s finished import­
ing the photos, tap the announcement box’s Open Album button to see your 
photos.
	
The Photos app only copies your camera’s photos onto your Surface; it doesn’t 
delete them from the camera. Your camera’s own menu offers an option to 
delete the photos or format its memory card. I’d love to tell you how, but dif­
ferent cameras have different menus.
	
If your Surface stops recognizing your camera when plugged in, open the 
Charms bar, choose Settings, choose PC Settings from the Settings pane, and 
tap PC and Devices from the PC Settings screen. When the PC and Devices 
screen appears, tap AutoPlay in the left column. Then tap your camera’s 
model number from the right pane; when the drop-down menu appears,

Connecting to a scanner
When you need to send somebody a copy of a paper document, the Surface 
gives you two options: You can simply take a photo of it with your Surface’s 
built-in camera, as I describe in Chapter 10. Or, if the Accounting Department 
requires higher-quality images for your Las Vegas expense receipts, you can 
scan them with a scanner.
Your Surface’s Scan app, found on the Start screen, ignores many older scan­
ners, unfortunately. But if your scanner is relatively new, the Scan app is a 
refreshing change from complicated scanner menus.
Follow these steps to transform a sheet of paper into a computer file:
	
	
1.	 From the Start screen, open the Scan app.
	
	 Shown in the margin, the Scan app appears on the screen. Don’t see the 
Scan app’s icon on the Start screen? Slide your finger upward from the 
middle of the Start screen to see the All Apps screen, then tap it from there.
	
	 If the Scan app complains that your scanner isn’t connected, make sure 
you’ve connected the USB cord between your computer and the scanner 
and that the scanner is turned on.
	
	 The Scan app, shown in Figure 6-14, lists your scanner’s name and the 
file type used for saving your files. (The default PNG file type is widely 
accepted by most programs.)
	
	 If the app doesn’t recognize your scanner, your scanner is too old. 
You’re stuck with the scanner’s bundled software — if it works — or, 
unfortunately, buying a new scanner.

Part II: Connections 
	
2.	(Optional) To change the settings, tap the Show More link.
	
	 The app’s default settings work fine for most jobs. But tapping the Show 
More link lets you customize your options for scanning certain items:
 
• File Type: If somebody requests a scan using a particular file type, 
like TIFF, Bitmap, OpenXPS or XPS, chose it here. Otherwise, stick 
with the default PNG.
 
• Color mode: Choose Color for color items, including color photos 
and color magazine pages. Choose Grayscale for nearly everything 
else. Only choose Black and White for line drawings or black-and-
white clip art; grayscale works better for everything else.
 
• Resolution (DPI): The default resolution of 300 dots per inch works 
fine. Higher resolution scans (larger numbers) bring more detail 
but consume more space, making them difficult to e-mail. Lower 
resolution scans show less detail but create smaller file sizes.
 
• Save File To: The Scan app normally creates a Scans folder in 
your Surface’s Pictures folder, where it stores your newly scanned 
images. If you prefer a different folder, tap this to choose it.
	
	
3.	 Tap the Preview button to test your scan.
	
	 The Scan app makes a first pass and shows you the results, as shown in 
Figure 6-15.
	
	 If the preview doesn’t look right, make sure you’ve made the right choice 
for your job. If you need to make different choices, go back to Step 2. 
If the preview shows a blank white page, make sure you’ve unlocked 
the scanner as described in the scanner’s bundled instruction sheets. 
(Unlocking usually requires sliding a switch or turning a knob.)
	
	 If you’re scanning a smaller item that doesn’t fill the entire scanner bed, 
look for the circle markers in each corner of the preview scan. Drag 
each circle inward to surround the area you want to copy, shown in 
Figure 6-15. That crops your scan to remove the boring white space.
	
	
4.	 Tap the Scan button.
	
	 The Scan app scans your image with the settings you’ve chosen in the 
previous steps and then saves your image in your Pictures folder’s Scan 
folder. Then it places a menu atop the screen with two options, View and 
Close.
	
5.	Tap View to see the scan; tap Close to close the menu.
	
	 View splits the screen, showing your Scan app on the screen’s left side, 
while the Photo app displays your scanned item on the right side. (I 
describe how to manipulate two apps on the same screen in Chapter 7.)

Figure 6-15: 
Tapping the

	 To rotate a photo in the Photos app, slide your finger up from the 
screen’s top or bottom edge to fetch the Photo app’s menus. Then tap 
the Rotate button, shown in the margin, until the photo faces the way 
you want. (I cover the Photo app in Chapter 10.)
	
	
	 To close the preview window, find the three little dots separating the 
Scan app’s window from the Photo apps window. Then slide the dots to 
the right, pushing the Photo app off the screen. That leaves the Scan app 
on the screen, ready for more photos. (I describe more about putting 
two apps on one screen in Chapter 7.)
The Scan app works well for fast, easy scans. But it relies on the simple, built-
in Windows software, which doesn’t understand a scanner’s built-in control 
buttons like PDF, or AutoScan.
If you want your scanner’s buttons to work or you need finer control over 
your scans, skip the Scan app, head for the desktop, and install the scan­
ner’s bundled software. (On some scanner models, Windows Update installs 
the scanner’s bundled software automatically as soon as you plug in the 
scanner.)
	
You can only install the scanner’s bundled software on a Surface Pro or 
Surface Pro 2. It won’t work on a Surface RT or Surface 2.

Connecting to a Monitor, an HDTV, 
or a Digital Projector
The screen on your Surface is larger than an iPad, but it’s probably smaller 
than your desktop PC’s monitor. That doesn’t mean you’re stuck with your 
Surface’s small screen, though. Your Surface includes a high-definition video 
port that lets you plug in desktop monitors, HDTV sets, and video digital 
projectors.
Because all three of those potential monitors plug in the same way, I refer to 
them all as monitors.
Plugging in a monitor not only gives you a larger screen, it gives you two 
screens: Your Surface’s screen stays active, as well, if you want.
This section explains how to connect a monitor to your Surface, as well as 
how to tell the monitor to begin displaying your Surface’s input. Finally, I 
explain all four ways your Surface can send its signal to your monitor.
Connecting your Surface to a monitor
In theory, connecting your Surface to a monitor is quite simple: Connect a 
cable between your Surface’s video port and your monitor’s input port.
The challenge is finding the right cable. No single cable works in every situa­
tion. That’s because Surface tablets and monitors contain different types of 
video connectors. And your cable needs the correct connector on each end, 
or it won’t fit.
All of the Surfaces connect using HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia 
Interface), although they do it in slightly different ways:
	
✓	The Surface RT and Surface 2 contain a micro-HDMI port.
	
✓	The Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 contain a Mini DisplayPort port.
TVs and monitors also include one or more types of video adapters:
	
✓	HDMI: Shown in Figure 6-16 (right), this port is the same as the ones 
found on many computers, but it’s full-size — more than twice as large. 
HDMI cables also carry the sound as well as the video, a perk when 
watching movies on a big screen.

 Chapter 6: Connecting to the Internet, Printers, Monitors, Storage, and More
	
Figure 6-16: 
Plug the 
small end 
of the cable 
into your 
Surface RT 
or Surface 2  
(left); the 
cable’s large 
end plugs 
into the 
monitor’s 
HDMI port 
(right).
	
	
✓	DVI: The next most popular, this connector appears mostly on PC moni­
tors rather than TVs.
	
✓	VGA: This oldster has graced the backs of monitors for more than 20 years, 
so it still exists as a last-resort connector. Cables and adapters with VGA 
connectors often cost more because they need more circuitry to translate 
between the types of signals flowing through the cable.
Matching your Surface’s video port with your monitor’s port leaves you with 
three ways to connect the two:
	
✓	Buy Microsoft’s customized adapters. At $40 apiece, Microsoft’s stylish 
adapters contain the correct jack for your Surface on one end, and a 
VGA or HDMI port on the other. Buy the adapter you need and then plug 
in your own standard VGA or HDMI cable.
	
✓	Buy a cable with the correct plug for your Surface on one end and the 
correct plug for your monitor on the other end. This might be your least 
expensive option for HDMI connections.
	
✓	If you already have a cable that fits into the video port on either your 
Surface or your monitor, head to Amazon (www.amazon.com), Newegg 
(www.newegg.com), or your local electronics store to buy an adapter for 
the cable’s other end. For example, an adapter can turn a standard HDMI 
plug into a micro-HDMI plug that fits into a Surface RT or Surface 2.
Depending on the variety of external monitors you plan to connect to your 
Surface, you may need to collect several types of cables or adapters.
www.it-ebooks.info

126
Part II: Connections 
	
The Surface’s sloped edges pose a challenge for many flat-faced adapters, 
especially those bought from third parties. If your adapter doesn’t reach far 
enough into your Surface’s video port, look closely at where the cable meets 
the Surface’s sloped case. You may be able to shave away some of the cable’s 
plastic end with a pocket knife, allowing the cable’s end to reach more deeply 
into the Surface’s port.
	
When shopping for HDMI cables, be aware that the higher-priced ones don’t 
make the video signal any better. The cables either work, or they just lie there 
like soggy noodles.
Sending the display to the 
attached monitor
After you’ve connected your Surface to a monitor with the right cable, you 
need to tell your Surface exactly how to send its image. Windows offers you 
four options, and you can see them by following these steps:
	
	
1.	 Swipe your finger inward from any screen’s right edge to fetch the 
Charms bar and then tap the Devices icon.
	
	
2.	 Tap the Project icon to connect with an attached monitor, a TV, or a 
digital projector.
	
	 I explain how to connect a cable between your Surface and the second 
monitor in the previous two sections.
	
	 The Project pane offers four choices, shown in Figure 6-17:
 
• PC Screen Only: This option recognizes the second monitor but 
keeps it blank, displaying only your Surface’s screen. It’s handy 
mostly when connecting to a projector at a meeting or conference. 
You can set up everything on your Surface without everybody having 
to see your busywork on the projector. Then, when you’re ready to 
wow the crowd, switch to one of the other modes, described next.
 
• Duplicate: Perhaps the easiest way to use two monitors, this option 
simply duplicates your Surface’s screen onto the second monitor or 
projector. It’s great for presentations, and it lets you control what 
you see on both screens. When your fingers touch the Surface, you 
see the effect on both screens.
 
• Extend: Meant mostly for office work, this option extends your 
Surface’s Desktop app across your second monitor, giving you an 
extra wide desktop. Or, you can keep the Start screen on your Surface 
and run your Windows desktop on the larger, second screen.
www.it-ebooks.info

127
 Chapter 6: Connecting to the Internet, Printers, Monitors, Storage, and More
 
• Second Screen Only: This option blanks the Surface’s screen, send­
ing the display only to your second monitor. It’s a simple way to con­
nect a larger monitor, but you lose the benefits of your touchscreen 
tablet. Unless you’re trying to mimic a desktop computer, complete 
with a mouse and keyboard, use the Duplicate option instead.
Figure 6-17: 
Choose 
how your 
Surface 
should 
handle 
your newly 
connected 
monitor.
After you tap your choice, your Surface may blank its screen as it looks for 
and connects to the second screen. A moment later, your Surface’s screen 
appears on the second screen.
	
Working on two different monitors simultaneously may be confusing at first. 
These tips help you adjust to this strange new configuration:
	
✓	When setting up the second monitor for the first time, choose the 
Duplicate option. That makes it a lot easier to see if your monitor is rec­
ognizing your Surface.
	
✓	Your Surface’s sound piggybacks along with its video through both an 
HDMI and a Mini DisplayPort cable. However, the sound plays through 
the speakers built into your monitor or TV set. If you want better sound, 
route the HDMI cable to your home stereo. Then have the stereo send 
the video to the monitor through a second HDMI cable.
	
✓	When you choose Extend, Windows makes the screen extend off your 
Surface’s right edge and onto the second monitor. To change that, 
visit the Desktop app’s Control Panel. There, in the Appearance and 
Personalization category’s Adjust Screen Resolution section, you can tell

✓	That same Adjust Screen Resolution section’s Detect and Identify but­
tons help you figure out which monitor is which. Then you can position 
the two screens to meet your needs.
	
✓	If you’re accustomed to using a mouse, the mouse-clickable corners on 
your Surface’s screen work on both monitors. Point and click in either 
monitor’s lower-left corner to fetch the Start menu, for example.
Making your monitor recognize 
your Surface
After you’ve connected the correct cable between your Surface and the monitor 
and told the Surface to send its signal to the monitor, you face one last challenge: 
You must convince the monitor to recognize your newly plugged-in Surface.
Some monitors recognize your Surface’s connection immediately, filling their 
screens with the colorful Surface tiles. Others require more coaxing.
The solution here works a little differently depending on whether you’re con­
necting your Surface to a HDTV or a PC monitor.
	
Make sure your Surface is turned on and set to Duplicate mode, described in 
the previous section, so your Surface sends a constant video signal to your 
monitor. When you see the Surface’s screen on the monitor, you’ll know you’ve 
found the right combination.
	
✓	HDTV: On your TV’s front panel or handheld remote control, look for 
a button for switching between video inputs. Keep slowly pressing the 
remote’s Video Input button, switching between inputs if necessary, 
until your Surface’s screen eventually appears.
	
✓	Monitor: If your monitor is already connected to another PC, take time 
to unplug the monitor from the second PC. (You can plug it back in when 
you’re through.) Your monitor should sense your Surface’s signal and 
automatically begin displaying it. (Sometimes turning the monitor on 
and off again helps it switch to the right signal.)
It might take a little fiddling, but you eventually see your Surface appear on 
the big screen.
Adding Portable Storage
Your Surface’s drive is speedy but tiny, especially when compared to today’s 
desktop PCs, which usually include more than 300GB of storage space.

 Chapter 6: Connecting to the Internet, Printers, Monitors, Storage, and More
Because apps can be installed only on your Surface’s internal drive, that 
doesn’t leave you much space for your own files.
If you need more storage, your Surface offers you several options, each serv­
ing different needs:
	
✓	Memory slot: This slot in your Surface, hidden beneath the kickstand, 
accepts a tiny memory card that holds up to 128GB. You can swap 
memory cards to access different batches of files. However, memory 
cards are tiny, expensive, easy to lose, and cumbersome to move 
between computers.
	
✓	Portable hard drive: Essential for people who collect a lot of informa­
tion in the field, portable hard drives let you tote a huge amount of files. 
Today’s portable hard drives can hold more than 4TB of information: 
That’s about 4,000GB, which should be more than enough space until 
you return to your desktop PC.
	
✓	Flash drives: Also known as thumb drives, these tiny drives make it easy 
to transfer files between your Surface and other PCs. (If you can’t find a 
printer that’s compatible with your Surface RT or Surface 2, copy those 
files from your Surface to a flash drive and then print them from your 
desktop PC.)
The following sections describe these storage spaces in more detail. And if 
that’s still not enough room, drop by the later section, “Connecting to the 
Cloud with OneDrive.”
Connecting to built-in memory cards
Your Surface includes a special slot for sliding in a tiny memory card. Many 
cell phones accept the same type of memory card, a fingernail-sized bit 
of plastic called microSD (micro Secure Digital), microSDHC (micro Secure 
Digital High Capacity), or microSDXC (micro Secure Digital eXtended 
Capacity).
To insert a memory card into a Surface, first locate your Surface’s memory 
card slot. The tiny slot lives behind the kickstand on the Surface RT and 
Surface 2, and on the right edge of the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2. (If you 
can’t find it, flip back to Chapter 2.)
The card fits into the slot only one way — the right way, as shown in Figure 6-18. 
Push the card into the slot until you hear it lock into place. (It will slide back out 
just a bit when locked into place.) Your Surface makes a joyous beeping sound 
as it recognizes the card.

Figure 6-18: 
Push the 
card into the 
slot until it 
locks into 
place.
To remove a card from your Surface, push it back into the slot until it unlocks 
and then pull it out. (Be careful, though: They’re spring loaded and some­
times shoot out.)
I explain how to copy information to and from cards and other storage 
spaces in Chapter 12.
	
✓	The microSDHC cards can hold up to 32GB, whereas the newer ­microSDXC 
cards currently come in capacities up to 128GB, with higher-capacity 
microSDXC cards arriving soon.
	
✓	You can’t store apps on the memory card, but you can store the biggest 
space hogs: videos, music, and photos.
	
✓	For easy file transfers, buy a memory card reader that accepts micro 
SDXC cards. Insert your memory card into the reader and copy files onto 
it with your desktop PC. Then remove the card and insert it back into 
your Surface to enjoy the card’s files.
Connecting to portable hard drives
If you own a large music, photo, or video collection, your Surface’s hard drive 
may not be large enough. Only one gadget can handle the job: a portable hard 
drive like the one shown in Figure 6-19.

Plug the cable from one of these small hard drives into your Surface’s USB 
port. After a few moments, the drive shows up in File Explorer, covered in 
Chapter 12.
Newer portable hard drives draw their power directly from your Surface’s 
USB port. Some older drives won’t work because they need more power than 
your Surface can give.
Portable hard drives typically hold up to 4TB of information, which is about 
4,000GB. That should be enough to last most people while on the road.
Connecting to flash drives for file transfers
An essential addition to your gadget bag, flash drives are tiny memory sticks 
that plug into the USB port on your Surface’s side. After they’re inserted, the 
drive appears in File Explorer. (If you’re working from the Start screen, you 
can also reach its files with the OneDrive app, covered in Chapter 4.)
Flash drives are the simplest and fastest ways to copy files to or from your 
Surface. In fact, they’re why your Surface beats many competing tablets: Few 
other tablets even include a full-sized USB port, much less let you copy files 
to and from a flash drive.
I explain how to copy files to and from drives with the Start screen’s OneDrive 
app in Chapter 4.

Part II: Connections 
Connecting to the Cloud with OneDrive
Today, it seems every company wants you to save your files on the cloud. 
The word cloud is technospeak for an online storage place — a personal 
cubbyhole on the Internet. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and a host of other 
companies offer free Internet storage spaces where you can keep your files. 
All Surface tablets include an app to access Microsoft’s brand of cloud, called 
OneDrive. (Microsoft renamed its SkyDrive service to OneDrive in early 2014.)
Storing files on the cloud brings several advantages, especially for a storage-
starved Surface:
	
✓	After you stash files on OneDrive, you can access them from any 
Internet-connected tablet, computer, or smartphone.
	
✓	When you edit a OneDrive-stored file — update a document with the 
latest information, for example — it’s automatically updated for all of 
your other devices, as well.
	
✓	Should you ever lose your Surface, your OneDrive files remain safe and 
password-protected in the cloud. And you can still access them from any 
web browser.
Just signing up for a Microsoft account gives you 7GB of free OneDrive stor­
age space, and if you bought a Surface 2 or Surface Pro 2, Microsoft gives you 
another 200GB of storage for a year.
Should you ever fill up your allotted OneDrive storage space, Microsoft offers 
you two choices:
	
✓	Pay up: Microsoft charges an annual fee that increases according to 
your allotted storage space.
	
✓	Pare down: Delete some of your OneDrive files to make room for your 
newer, incoming files.
But whether you live with 7GB of space or splurge for extra, your Surface lets 
you access your OneDrive-stashed files any of three ways:
	
	
✓	OneDrive app: The OneDrive app lets you manage your files from the 
touchscreen — no mouse needed. But it’s designed mostly for copying a 
few files back and forth. The app can’t copy folders, for example, just files.
	
✓	Desktop: The traditional Windows desktop in Windows 8.1, covered in 
Chapter 12, embeds OneDrive directly into the File Manager. OneDrive 
appears as a location in every folder’s Navigation pane along the left 
edge. If you use OneDrive a lot, you’ll probably want to access it from 
there: On the desktop, OneDrive behaves much like any other folder.

133
 Chapter 6: Connecting to the Internet, Printers, Monitors, Storage, and More
	
✓	Internet Explorer: You can access your OneDrive files from any comput­
er’s web browser, including Internet Explorer. To visit, head to http://
onedrive.live.com and log in with your Microsoft account.
The next two sections explain how to upload files from your Surface to 
OneDrive and how to download files from OneDrive to your Surface.
Uploading files from your 
Surface to OneDrive
Uploading files to OneDrive makes them accessible to any computer you use, 
as well as your smartphone. If you’re connected with the Internet, OneDrive 
provides an easy way of overcoming your Surface’s limited storage space.
To upload files from your Surface to OneDrive, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Start screen, tap the OneDrive app.
	
	 The OneDrive app fills the screen, shown in Figure 6-20, showing all of 
your folders and files uploaded to your OneDrive account.
	
	 The OneDrive app shows your stored files’ names even if you’re not con­
nected to the Internet. You can even view your photos. However, you 
can’t download or edit files without an Internet connection. (I describe 
how to overcome that obstacle in the next section, “Making OneDrive 
files available offline.”)

2.	Navigate to the OneDrive folder where you’d like to upload the files.
	
	
	 Tap any OneDrive folder (it looks like a tile), and OneDrive opens it to 
display the files and folders stored inside. To back out from a folder, tap 
the back arrow in the screen’s upper-left corner.
	
	
	 To create a new folder on OneDrive, fetch its menus by sliding your 
finger up from the screen’s bottom edge. Then tap the New Folder icon 
(shown in the margin), type a name for your new folder, and tap the 
Create button.
	
	 When you’re peering inside the OneDrive folder you’d like to stuff with 
files, move to the next step.
	
3.	To upload files from your Surface, fetch the OneDrive app’s menu bar 
and tap the Add Files icon.
	
	
	 To fetch the OneDrive app’s menu bar, slide your finger up from the 
screen’s bottom edge or down from the top. When the App bar appears, 
tap the Add Files icon.
	
	 The OneDrive’s File Picker appears, shown in Figure 6-21, showing your 
Surface’s available files and folders.
Figure 6-21:

lets you

4.	Browse to the files you want to upload, select them with a tap, and 
then tap the Copy to OneDrive button.
	
	 You navigate through the File Picker just as you did through OneDrive: 
Tap a folder to see what’s inside; tap the Go Up link to back out and 
delve into a different folder.
www.it-ebooks.info

135
 Chapter 6: Connecting to the Internet, Printers, Monitors, Storage, and More
	
	 When you’ve found the folder containing the files you want, select the 
ones you want to send into OneDrive: Select them all by tapping Select 
All along the window’s top. Or, cherry-pick the ones you want by tapping 
on them individually.
	
	 Finished? Tap the Copy to OneDrive button to send them to the OneDrive 
folder you picked in Step 2.
The OneDrive app grabs the files you’ve selected and copies them to your 
folder on OneDrive. Depending on the size and number of files, OneDrive can 
take from anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to copy the files.
Making OneDrive files available offline
Your OneDrive cubbyhole lives on the Internet — the cloud, as the computing 
world calls it. And when your Surface is connected to the Internet, OneDrive 
files open just as if they were stored on your Surface.
But what if you’re not connected to the Internet? Surprisingly, not much 
changes. You can still browse your OneDrive files. You can see their folder 
and filenames, for example, although their icons are fainter than usual. (That 
faintness provides a visual clue that you’re not connected to the Internet.)
You can even fill the screen with your photos, scrolling through them like 
they were actually stored on your Surface.
But here’s the clincher: If you want to open or edit those OneDrive files with­
out an Internet connection, you’re stuck.
	
So, if you want the luxury of editing your OneDrive files at any time, tell 
OneDrive to make those files or folders available offline. That way you can 
access them without an Internet connection.
To make some or all of your OneDrive files available offline, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	From the Start screen, tap the OneDrive app.
	
	 The OneDrive app fills the screen, as shown earlier in Figure 6-20, dis­
playing all of your folders and files uploaded to your OneDrive account.
	
2.	Navigate to the OneDrive folder containing your folders and files.
www.it-ebooks.info

136
Part II: Connections 
	
3.	Select the folders or files you’d like to make available offline by swip­
ing down on them with your finger.
	
	 Swipe down on the Documents folder, for example, shown in Figure 6-22. 
A check mark appears next to it, and the App bar appears as a strip 
below it.
Figure 6-22: 
Swipe down 
on each file 
or folder 
you want to 
make avail-
able offline, 
and tap 
the Make 
Offline icon.
	
4.	Tap the Make Offline icon.
	
	
	 Tap the Make Offline icon (shown in the margin) from the App bar 
along the screen’s bottom, and the OneDrive app copies the file to your 
Surface. (To return the files to online only status, repeat these steps, but 
choose Make Online Only in Step 4.)
Making files available offline comes with a few peculiarities. The key is to 
remember that OneDrive always keeps the files in sync:
	
✓	Whenever you edit an offline file or folder on your Surface, OneDrive 
automatically updates its own copy, as well, as soon as you reconnect to 
the Internet.
	
✓	If you use another PC to update OneDrive’s copy of that file, then 
OneDrive will automatically update your Surface’s copy the next time 
you connect to the Internet.
	
✓	If you’re editing a OneDrive file on one PC, and somebody else tries to 
open that file on another PC, he’ll be able to open the file. But he won’t 
be able to edit it. Instead, he’ll see a Locked message that lists who is 
currently editing that file. When the other person closes the file, you’ll 
be able to edit it.

137
 Chapter 6: Connecting to the Internet, Printers, Monitors, Storage, and More
	
✓	Making OneDrive files available offline consumes storage space, and 
most Surface models don’t come with much storage space to spare. To 
keep from filling up your Surface, choose only your most important files 
or folders to make available offline.
	
✓	If your Surface has oodles of storage space, however, you can easily 
make your entire OneDrive contents available offline: Open the OneDrive 
app, fetch the Charms bar, and tap Settings. When the Settings pane 
appears, tap Options at the top and then tap the toggle called Access All 
Files Offline. (Tap the toggle again to delete the copies, leaving the origi­
nals on OneDrive.)

T

he latest version of Windows brings many changes, but one of the most 
­baffling is that it no longer likes the word program. As a result, programs — 
software that runs on the Windows desktop — are now called apps in the new 
world of Windows. Confusingly, Windows also uses the word apps to describe 
programs running on the Start screen.
This odd nomenclature causes some confusion. For example, the Surface RT 
and Surface 2 can run only Start screen apps. The Surface Pro and Surface 
Pro 2, by contrast, can run both apps and desktop programs. But if you look 
at Microsoft’s website, it simply says both types of Surface run apps, as if the 
word programs no longer exists.
It’s way too early to retire the word program — it still appears on all your 
old software boxes, installation discs, and manuals, so this book refers to 
Windows desktop software as programs.
Mini-programs that run on the Start screen are called apps.
With that bit of linguistics taken care of, this chapter tackles a more impor­
tant topic: Just what can you do with the darn things on your Surface?

Part II: Connections 
Making the Most of Apps
You can download and install new apps, covered later in this chapter, but 
your Surface comes with more than a dozen built-in apps. Most of them live 
right on the Start screen for easy access.
Others aren’t listed on the Start screen but hide in the Start screen’s All Apps 
area. To see all of your installed apps, slide your finger upward from the 
middle of the Start screen. A formerly hidden screen comes into view, show­
ing alphabetically organized icons for all of your apps.
But whether they’re listed on your Start screen or hiding in the All Apps area, 
the following apps appear on every Surface tablet:
	
	
✓	Alarms: New in Windows 8.1, this lets you set a wakeup alarm, a timer, 
or a stopwatch.
	
	
✓	Bing Travel: Designed around people who keep their suitcase packed, 
this app caters to impulse buyers. Formerly called just Travel, the app is 
filled with tempting panoramic photos of travel hotspots, maps, reviews, 
and, of course, links for booking flights and hotels.
Mini cheat sheet for apps
The Start screen serves up a smorgasbord of 
apps, each built to handle a specific task. But 
no matter how much the apps differ, every app 
shares the same basic commands. These tips 
work in every app, whether they came bundled 
with your Surface, or you downloaded them 
from the Windows Store:
	✓	Open an app. From the Start screen, tap 
the app’s tile with a finger. (You can return 
to the Start screen with a press of your 
Surface’s Windows key.)
	✓	Close an app. Apps needn’t be closed, as I 
explain in Chapter 4. But if you really want 
to close your currently viewed app, slide 
your finger all the way down the Surface’s 
screen, from the top edge to bottom edge.
	✓	Change an app’s settings. After opening the 
app, fetch the Charms bar by sliding your 
finger inward from the screen’s right edge. 
Then tap the Charms bar’s Settings icon 
to see every setting your app allows to be 
changed.
	✓	Print from an app. Fetch the Charms bar, tap 
the bar’s Device’s icon, tap Print, and tap 
your printer’s name. (Not all apps can print.)
	✓	View an app’s menus. Slide your finger up a 
bit from the screen’s bottom edge or down a 
bit from the top edge.
	✓	Return to your last-used app. Slide your finger 
inward from the screen’s left edge; your finger 
drags your last-used app into view.
	✓	See currently running apps. Slide your 
finger in slightly from the screen’s left 
edge and then back to the left edge. A strip 
appears along the left edge, displaying 
thumbnails of your currently running apps. 
To return to an app, tap its thumbnail.

 Chapter 7: All About Apps
	
	
✓	Calculator: Another app introduced in Windows 8.1, Calculator offers 
standard, scientific, and conversion modes to meet the needs of stu­
dents, cooks, and budding physicists.
	
	
✓	Calendar: This handy app lets you enter your upcoming appointments, 
of course. But it can also automatically fetch appointments you’ve made 
in online calendars. The app then blends appointments from several 
sources into one calendar. I cover the Calendar app in Chapter 9.
	
	
✓	Camera: Your Surface’s front camera works best for vanity shots, 
whereas the back camera is more suited for scenic vistas (if you don’t 
mind looking dorky while holding up your tablet to frame the wonders of 
nature). I explain how to use your Surface’s camera in Chapter 10.
	
	
✓	Desktop: A tap of the Start screen’s Desktop tile fetches the traditional 
Windows desktop, covered in Chapter 12. There, you find several of the 
usual Windows accessories, such as Paint and Notepad, as well as the 
robust File Manager. The Desktop app lets you run all of your old, tradi­
tional Windows programs. (Surface RT and Surface 2 tablets include the 
Desktop app, but they can’t install your older Windows software.)
	
	
✓	Finance: In the U.S., this tile shows a 30-minute delay of the Dow, 
NASDAQ, and S&P. (You can set it to display indexes of markets in other 
countries, as well.) Tap the tile to open the Finance app, filled with 
charts, indexes, news, rates, and stocks you’ve added to your personal­
ized Watchlist.
	
	
✓	Food and Drink: Another new app for Windows 8.1, this helps you plan 
meals and catalog your recipes. Look for the hands-free mode, which 
automatically turns pages with a wave of your batter-spattered hand.
	
	
✓	Fresh Paint: This drawing program, added for Windows 8.1, lets you 
create art several ways: from scratch, based on a photograph, or based 
on an existing drawing or image. Budding digital artists should take the 
tutorial, because digital watercolor brushes work quite differently.
	
	
✓	Games: A tap of the Games app brings the Xbox Games app, a link to 
your Xbox game console. Here, you can see your Xbox friends and 
gaming achievements, as well as view game trailers and buy Xbox 
games. (The app also lists a few free games to play on your Surface.)
	
	
✓	Health and Fitness: New for Windows 8.1, this offers not only exercise 
tips but also information about nutrition, well-being, and prescription 
drug interactions.
	
	
✓	Help + Tips: Missing from Windows 8, this app finally tries to explain 
how to use this drastically new version of Windows.
	
	
✓	Internet Explorer: This no-nonsense browser site fills the screen with your 
currently viewed website, with no messy menus or tabs to get in the way. 
To see the app’s menus, slide your finger up from the screen’s bottom edge. 
(I cover this stripped-down version of Internet Explorer in Chapter 8.)

✓	Mail: Described in Chapter 9, this simple app lets you send and receive 
files and e-mail. It works in conjunction with your People app, automati­
cally filling in e-mail addresses as you begin typing a person’s name.
	
	
✓	Maps: A tap of the Maps app brings up Microsoft Bing Maps and a view 
of your current city. Because current Surface models lack a GPS (Global 
Positioning System) chip, the Maps app won’t pinpoint your exact loca­
tion or offer turn-by-turn navigation. However, it can dish up accurate 
directions when you type in two addresses.
	
	
✓	Music: This music player, covered in Chapter 11, plays music stored on 
your Surface or stashed away on OneDrive (covered in Chapter 6). It’s 
also a gateway to Xbox Live Music, which offers an array of streaming 
music options to owners of an Xbox game console.
	
	
✓	News: Drop by here to read news pulled from a wide variety of news 
sources, customized according to your interest or geographical location.
	
	
✓	OneDrive: This app lets you stash files online, where you can share 
them with other people and access them from other computers. 
OneDrive also serves as a convenient way to add storage to a space-
deprived Surface. I cover OneDrive and other storage solutions in 
Chapter 6.
	
	
✓	OneNote: This finger-friendly digital notebook app works fine on its own, 
or it syncs with the full version, which runs on the desktop. OneNote 
lets you collect and organize notes, either typed or handwritten. You can 
also toss in photos and recordings when needed.
	
	
✓	PC Settings: This simply opens the PC Settings screen, saving you from a 
trip to the Charms bar.
	
	
✓	People: The People app, covered in Chapter 9, contains your friends’ 
contact information. You can enter or edit the details yourself or let 
the app automatically harvest your friends’ information from your 
Facebook, Twitter, Google, or other online networks.
	
	
✓	Photos: The Photos app, covered in Chapter 10, lets you show off photos 
stored on your Surface or OneDrive. It can also import photos from your 
digital camera.
	
	
✓	Reader: Many downloadable documents and manuals come stored in 
Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF), and this app opens them for 
easy reading.
	
	
✓	Reading List: Don’t have time to read that extraordinary Internet 
article? Fetch the Charms bar, choose Share, and toss the article onto 
the Reading List app. When you open the Reading List app, all of your 
articles will be waiting for you.
	
	
✓	Scan: Covered in Chapter 6, this Windows 8.1 app finds your attached 
scanner and lets you scan documents right from the Start screen.

✓	Skype: Covered in Chapter 9, this app lets you chat, swap instant mes­
sages, or hold face-to-face meetings over the Internet.
	
	
✓	Skype WiFi: Also covered in Chapter 9, Skype WiFi lets you connect with 
wireless Internet networks across the globe.
	
	
✓	Sound Recorder: This simple recorder works well for recording classes 
or recording short bursts of inspiration.
	
	
✓	Sports: Sports fans drop by here to see the latest team scores and 
game news. Open the App bar and tap Favorite Teams to create a 
­mini-newspaper devoted to your favorite team’s news and statistics.
	
	
✓	Store: To download new apps, visit the Windows Store, covered later in 
this chapter.
	
	
✓	Video: This plays videos from your Surface and its storage areas, as well 
as providing a portal to Xbox Video, covered in Chapter 10.
	
	
✓	Weather: This personalized weather station grants you a weeklong 
glimpse into your city’s future weather patterns. (Load the App bar and 
tap Places to add other cities to the app’s crystal ball.)
I explain the mechanics of the Start screen in Chapter 4, including tips on 
adding, removing, and organizing apps on the Start screen.
Customizing apps to meet your needs
Microsoft’s built-in apps come preset to cater to the widest audience. But 
once they’re living on your Surface, take some time to make them cater to 
your own needs instead. Tell the Weather app to display your own city, for 
example; add your favorite newspapers to the News app and add your favor­
ite sports teams to the Sports app.
The customization tricks described here apply to most apps, whether they 
came bundled with your Surface or you downloaded them from the Windows 
Store app.
To customize any open app, follow these steps:
	
1.	Fetch the App menu, called the App bar, by sliding your finger 
up slightly from the screen’s bottom, or down slightly from the 
screen’s top.
	
	 Different apps treat their App bar differently. Some place their menu along 
the bottom, others drop them down from the top, and some do both.
www.it-ebooks.info

144
Part II: Connections 
	
2.	When the App bar appears, tap its buttons to customize the app to 
your needs.
	
	 Fetch the App bar in the News app, for example, shown in Figure 7-1, and 
the top App bar offers three options:
 
• Bing News: The equivalent of a browser’s Home button, a tap of 
this button returns you to the News app’s front page. (It’s called 
Bing News because Microsoft’s search engine, Bing, constantly 
stocks the News app with the latest news.)
 
• Topics: Tap here to personalize your news with topics of interest 
to you. To start, tap the plus sign within the Add a Topic box; when 
the Add a Topic screen appears, type a favorite topic. Tap the Add 
button, and the Bing News section collects stories on that topic. 
Revisit Topics to see the latest news about that specific subject.
	
	Place quotes around your search term to find results that contain 
that exact phrase. For example, type “brussels sprouts” to see 
news only about today’s trendy vegetable. Type brussels sprouts, 
by contrast, and the app fetches news about Belgium and salad 
toppings.
 
• Sources: Want to read information from one favorite source? Tap 
the Sources option to read news from a particular news outlet, 
including the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Time, and 
many of your favorite websites.
 
• Video: Many news outlets include videos with their stories, and 
this button takes you directly to the hour’s most popular news 
videos. (If a video doesn’t hold your interest, tap the screen; then 
tap the Back arrow that appears in the upper-left corner.)

After customizing the News app to meet your own interests, try these other 
tips to personalize your Surface’s other apps:
	
✓	Traveling to a new city? Prepare yourself by opening the Bing Travel 
app, typing your destination into the Search Destinations box, and tap­
ping the Magnifying Glass icon. When the travel guide shows your desti­
nation, swipe up from the screen’s bottom edge and tap Pin to Start; that 
places a travel guide to that city on your Start screen.
	
✓	Add your stock portfolio to the Finance app by fetching its App bar, tap­
ping the Watchlist button, and tapping the plus sign to add stocks sym­
bols. After you’ve added your portfolio, tap any of the stock’s symbols 
to see detailed information about the stock’s historical value.
	
✓	If you click the Allow button when the Weather app first asks your 
location, the app automatically updates its Start screen tile with your 
city’s weather forecast. To add other cities, fetch the App bar, tap 
Places, tap the Favorites button, type another location, and tap the 
Add button.
	
✓	Several other apps ask permission to use your location to tailor their 
information. To see the list of apps you’ve approved — and revoke their 
access, if you want — fetch the Charms bar, tap Settings, and choose 
Change PC Settings from the Settings pane. When the PC Settings screen 
appears, tap Privacy and then choose Location from the Privacy screen. 
There, you find toggle switches for every app that requests location 
information.
	
✓	If you don’t see any way to customize an app on its App bar, fetch the 
Charms bar and tap the Settings icon. When the Settings pane appears, 
check the list near the top edge. Some options let you change or person­
alize your app’s behavior.
Organizing your apps
Microsoft sets up your Surface’s Start screen in a pretty boring way. And 
as you begin adding apps, it changes from boring to a sprawling mess that 
creeps out of sight past the screen’s right edge.
To make your Surface yours, take control of your Start screen, personalizing 
it to fit your lifestyle. As I explain in Chapter 4, you can remove tiles for apps 
you don’t use, add tiles for apps you do use, move related tiles into groups, 
and move favorite tiles to the front so they’re easy to tap.
After you’ve done that, Microsoft’s Surface will start looking a lot more like 
your Surface.

Downloading new apps from 
the Windows Store
Your Surface comes with plenty of built-in apps, described in the previous 
section. But sooner or later, those won’t be enough. When you need to beef 
up your Surface with more features, there’s an app for that: It’s called the 
Windows Store app.
The Store’s apps let you mold your Surface around your own interests. 
Birdwatchers can download bird-watching tools. Sailors can download tide-
prediction apps. Cooks can download recipe collections. You’ll even find music 
and video playing programs that compete with Microsoft’s built-in offerings.
As programmers write more apps to fill in more niches, the Store’s wares 
keep growing. And best of all, most of the apps are free.
	
Because the Surface RT and Surface 2 tablets can’t run desktop programs, 
they’re limited to apps downloaded from the Store app. In fact, you won’t even 
see apps that run on Surface Pro or Surface Pro 2.
To add new apps to your Surface, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Store app.
	
	
	 If you’re not already on the Start screen, head there with a press of the 
Windows key. Tap the Store app’s tile, and the Store app fills the screen, 
shown in Figure 7-2.
Figure 7-2:

 Chapter 7: All About Apps
	
2.	Browse for apps, tapping interesting apps to read their description, 
details, and reviews left by others.
	
	 You can search for a specific app, as I describe in the next step. But if 
you feel like browsing, the Store app offers several ways to window shop 
its app collection.
	
	
	 As you browse, watch for the left-pointing arrow in the screen’s top-left 
corner. Tap that arrow to return to the Store page you just left.
	
	 When you first open the Store, Microsoft displays “featured” apps — apps 
that pay to appear first. So, to see apps ranked by their merit rather than 
their marketing money, keep scrolling to the right until you see these 
categories:
 
• Picks for You: As your Surface learns about your interests, it 
places apps you may like in this category.
 
• Trending: These apps are creating a buzz, either through Internet 
chatter or other media attention. Give these a look to see what 
everybody’s talking about.
 
• New & Rising: Newly released apps that have made an impression 
appear here. Some are long-awaited apps that recently appeared in 
the store — Facebook’s app, for example. Others come from popu­
lar websites that finally took the plunge and created a Windows 
app to display their information.
 
• Top Paid: High-quality games, in particular, tend to appear here. Give 
these a close look because people are finding them worth buying.
 
• Top Free: Be sure to tap the Top Free tile to see the most popular 
free apps. Chances are good that you’ll want to grab the top five.
	
	 You can also browse by category by sliding your finger up from the 
screen’s bottom or slightly down from the screen’s top. The App bar 
appears along the top, shown in Figure 7-3, letting you tap the category 
of apps you want to browse.
	
	 If you spot the app of your dreams, head to Step 4 to install it onto your 
Surface. If you still can’t find the right app, move to the next step and 
search for it.
	
3.	Search for an app.
	
	 When you can’t find what you want by browsing, try searching: Type a 
keyword or two that describes your app in the Search box, located in the 
top-right corner of every screen. After typing your keywords, press Enter 
or tap the Magnifying glass icon on the right side of the Search box.
	
	 In Windows 8, searching within apps took place through the Charms 
bar’s Search icon. Windows 8.1 drops that approach, and now you 
search within apps from the Search box built directly into the app, usu­
ally in its upper-right corner.

	 The app’s page in the Store appears, shown in Figure 7-5, and offers 
three ways to see more about the app.
www.it-ebooks.info

149
 Chapter 7: All About Apps
 
• Overview: The app displays this page by default, as shown in 
Figure 7-5. Here, you see a picture and description of the app, its 
features, and ways to see more information: the app’s website, for 
example, as well as the app’s support page and legal terms.
	
	Slide your finger up and down on the app’s picture to see addi­
tional photos. Most apps offer two or more photos of how the app 
will look on your Surface.
 
• Details: Although boring, this page may be the most important. It 
elaborates on the details shown in the app’s far-right pane, lists 
what bugs were fixed in the latest release, what processors the app 
supports, and the permissions it requires.
 
• Reviews: Here, owners leave comments based on their experience. 
Judge by the consensus rather than individual reviews: Different 
people have different expectations.
	
	 Looking at an app’s pictures and reading an app’s Overview, Details, and 
Reviews pages let you know whether the app is right for you or whether 
you should continue browsing.

the right to

5.	Install or buy the app.
	
	 When you find an app you want to place on your Surface, the app’s page 
(shown earlier in Figure 7-5) displays any of three buttons:
 
• Install: Found on free apps and purchased-but-uninstalled apps, 
tap this button to install the app onto your Surface. A minute or 
so after you tap the Install button, the app appears on your Start 
screen’s All Apps area. (To see the Start screen’s All Apps area, 
slide your finger upward from the middle of the Start screen.)
www.it-ebooks.info

150
Part II: Connections 
 
• Try: Found on paid apps, tap this to try out the app for a week. 
After a week, the app expires unless you tap the Buy button, open­
ing your wallet for the app’s full price.
 
• Buy: Paid apps cost anywhere from $1.49 to $999.99, but most 
cost less than $5. Tapping the Buy button lets you purchase the 
app immediately if you’ve already linked a credit card with your 
Microsoft account. No credit card link? Then the Buy button takes 
you to a secure website to enter that information.
	
	 If you don’t see a button, the words You Own This App appear, meaning 
you’ve already downloaded the app. If it’s missing from your Start screen, 
visit the Start screen’s All Apps screen just below the Start screen. That 
presents an alphabetical list of all the apps installed on your Surface.
	
6.	Wait for the app to download.
	
	 Most apps download in less than two minutes. When the app finishes 
downloading, a notice pops up in the screen’s upper-right corner, telling 
you the app was installed.
There’s one oddity, though: Your downloaded app won’t appear on the Start 
screen. Instead, it’s in the screen below the Start screen. Slide your finger up 
the Start screen to pull the All Apps screen in view, and your newly down­
loaded app will be listed in alphabetical order with all of your other apps.
As the Store’s number of apps increases, you’ll be able to add many extra 
powers to your Surface quickly, and easily — a welcome change from the 
days of old when you needed to slide discs into your computer, hoping every­
thing would work.
Apps constantly change. Companies release newer versions to add features 
and patch security holes. Unlike Windows 8, Windows 8.1 automatically 
keeps your apps up-to-date. If you haven’t upgraded your Surface RT or 
Surface Pro to Windows 8.1, you’re missing out on that handy feature.
	
Apps that run on the Surface RT and Surface 2 are known as ARM apps, named 
after the Advanced RISC Machines company that created the special low-
power chip inside those Surface models. Surface RT and Surface 2 tablets can 
install only apps written for ARM processors. Surface Pro and Pro 2 tablets, by 
contrast, can run only apps written for x86, x64 processors. (As you browse 
the apps, the Store helps out by showing only apps that run on your particular 
Surface model.)
Uninstalling or changing an app
Before you can uninstall or change an app, you need to select its tile on the 
Start screen. Oddly enough, selecting an app’s Start screen tile is a task rarely 
stumbled upon on your own. So, here’s the secret:
www.it-ebooks.info

151
 Chapter 7: All About Apps
	
To select an app on the Start screen, hold your finger down on its icon until 
the App bar appears along the bottom.
After you select an app, a check mark appears in the app’s top-right corner, 
like the Bing Travel app shown in Figure 7-6. The App bar also appears along 
the bottom, listing everything you can do with your newly selected app.
Figure 7-6: 
After you 
select an 
app, the App 
bar appears 
along the 
screen’s 
bottom, 
letting you 
choose how 
to change 
that app.
	
	
✓	To uninstall an app, tap the Uninstall button from the App bar.
	
✓	You can also uninstall apps that came pre-installed on your Surface. If 
you’re not using one of your Surface’s bundled apps, feel free to uninstall 
it. (It can always be reinstalled from the Windows Store.)
	
✓	App bar icons also let you change the size of an app’s tile, start or stop 
the app’s live updates, or unpin (remove) the app from the Start screen.
	
✓	Selecting the Start screen tile of a traditional Windows desktop program 
brings a slightly different set of icons to the App bar. You can open the 
program in a new desktop window, pin it to the desktop’s taskbar, or 
view its location in the desktop’s File Explorer program.
	
	
✓	The Windows 8.1 Spring Update, released through Windows Update in 
April, lets you pin Start screen apps to the desktop’s taskbar, making 
them easy to access without a trip to the Start screen.
	
✓	You can select more than one app at a time, which is handy when weed­
ing out a batch of unwanted tiles from the Start screen.

Working with Two Apps on One Screen
Windows lets you place two apps side by side. In fact, it will probably happen 
when you don’t expect it: You click a link that somebody mailed you, and all 
of a sudden the Mail app shrinks to fill half the screen, and Internet Explorer 
fills the screen’s other half to display the linked page.
Windows calls that “snapping an app” because you’re snapping one app next 
to another on the same screen. You can snap Start screen apps next to each 
other, and you can even snap a Start screen app next to your traditional 
Windows desktop. To snap an app, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open an app that you’d like to use and snap it to the screen’s left or right.
	
	 Tap an app from the Start menu to open it. When it fills the screen, slide 
your finger down from the screen’s top until the app turns into a small 
window on a blank screen, as shown in Figure 7-7.
	
Figure 7-7: 
Drag your 
finger down 
from the 
screen’s 
top edge 
until the 
app shrinks 
into a small 
window.
	
	
	 Then, drag the app to the screen’s left or right side; when a horizontal 
line appears, lift your finger; the app “snaps” to the closest edge, as 
shown in Figure 7-8.
	
	 If you’re using a mouse, point at the top of the app and, while holding 
down the right mouse button, drag the app downward. When the app 
shrinks, drag it to the left or right side of the screen to snap it into place.

2.	Return to the Start screen and open a second app; it snaps to the 
opposite side of the screen.
	
	 When you open the second app, it automatically snaps to the empty side 
of the screen, leaving both apps onscreen, as shown in Figure 7-9.

3.	To resize the apps, drag the divider between them.
	
	
	 Find the three dots (shown in the margin) on the line separating the 
two snapped apps. Then drag those three dots to the left or right side, 
depending on which app you want to enlarge.
	
	 To close a snapped app, drag the three dots all the way toward the app 
you want to close; when your finger reaches the edge, the app disap­
pears from the screen. (It stays running in the background, though, so 
you can return to it later.)
	
4.	If desired, replace a snapped app with a different one.
	
	 If you revisit the Start screen and open a third app, that app opens as a 
small window on top of the other two, as shown in Figure 7-10. Tap the 
app you don’t want, and the hovering third app jumps in to replace it.
Figure 7-10: 
Open a third 
app and 
it hovers, 
waiting for 
you to tap 
the snapped 
app it should 
replace.
By opening and snapping apps, dragging the divider between them, and 
replacing snapped apps with others, you can make the most of the Start 
screen’s formerly full-screen apps.
	
Want to snap an app that’s already open? Reveal all of your open apps by slid­
ing your screen in about an inch from the left edge and then back again. A row 
of thumbnail-sized apps appears, representing your open apps. Drag any of 
those thumbnails to the screen’s left or right edges, and it snaps to that side.
You can also snap apps alongside the Windows Desktop app, a handy way to 
keep an eye on e-mail while working.

Installing Desktop Programs
	
Surface RT and Surface 2 tablets include a traditional Windows desktop, but 
with one big restriction: They won’t let you install any programs onto the 
desktop. Instead, Surface RT and Surface 2 tablets are limited to downloads 
from the Windows Store app.
Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 tablets, by contrast, include a fully functional 
desktop, just like the one found on desktop PCs. But because your Surface 
lacks a CD or DVD drive, how do you install a desktop program?
You have several options:
	
✓	Windows Store: When you browse the Windows Store app with a 
Surface Pro or Surface Pro 2 tablet, many desktop programs appear 
along with the Store’s list of apps. When looking at a program you want, 
tap the Go to Publisher’s Website link. The software publisher’s website 
appears, and you can buy the program if required, download the pro­
gram, and install it by double-tapping its download icon.
	
✓	Website: Desktop programs not listed in the Windows Store can still be 
downloaded directly from the Internet, just as in previous versions of 
Windows.
	
✓	Flash drive: All Surface tablets include a USB port. You can copy or 
download a program’s installation file onto a flash drive with another 
computer, and then insert the flash drive into your Surface and install it 
from there.
	
✓	OneDrive: Described in Chapter 6, this online cubby hole works well for 
swapping files between your Surface and desktop PC. From your desktop 
PC, copy a program’s installation file to any folder in OneDrive. Then, 
open the Start screen’s OneDrive app, visit the OneDrive folder, and tap 
the program’s installation file to install it.

our Internet-hungry Surface includes two web browsers. The Start 
screen’s nimble browser works easily with your fingers. The old-school 
browser on the Desktop app provides extra power but works best with a key­
board and trackpad or mouse.
Although the two browsers behave quite differently, they’re oddly inter­
twined: They share your home page, login passwords, browsing history, and 
your list of favorites sites, among other things. Adding to the confusion, both 
browsers bear the same name: Internet Explorer.
Chances are good that you’re fairly familiar with the desktop version of 
Internet Explorer. And, on a touch-screen service, you’ll find yourself poking 
the Start screen’s browser much more often.
The following sections explain everything you need to know about the Start 
screen’s nimble browser: how to find and open its menus, quickly load your 
favorite sites, simultaneously browse several sites, share and download 
files and information, and adjust your browser’s settings — all with your 
fingertips.

Part II: Connections 
Opening Internet Explorer
Your Surface contains two versions of Internet Explorer, each opened in a 
slightly different way. These sections explain how to open each, and when to 
choose one browser over another.
Opening the Start Screen’s 
Internet Explorer app
You’ll find yourself using the Start screen browser much more often than the 
desktop browser. Unlike the desktop browser, the Start screen browser is 
designed for your fingers, and its icon lives directly on the Start screen.
	
	 To open the Start screen’s browser, tap its icon (shown in the margin) on the 
Start screen. The browser opens, filling the screen as shown in Figure 8-1.
Figure 8-1: 
Like all Start 
screen 
apps, the 
Internet 
Explorer 
app hides 
its menus, 
filling the 
screen 
with your 
website.
When opened, the Start screen’s browser displays one of these three things:
	
✓	Your home page: When opened for the first time, the Start screen’s 
browser displays your home page: a favorite site you’ve chosen to dis­
play whenever you open Internet Explorer. If you haven’t chosen a home 
page, as I describe later in this chapter, Microsoft fills the screen with 
one of its own websites.
www.it-ebooks.info

159
 Chapter 8: Browsing the Web
	
✓	Your last-visited site: Unless you specifically closed the browser after 
your last visit, the browser displays the same site you last visited. (I 
explain how to close apps in Chapter 4.)
	
✓	You’re not connected: When the browser displays this alarming error 
message, it means your Surface lacks an Internet connection. (I explain 
how to connect with the Internet in Chapter 6.)
But no matter which page your browser displays upon opening, notice how 
the page completely fills the screen. That makes the page easier to read, but 
it also highlights the Internet Explorer app’s greatest weakness: The browser 
hides all of its menus.
You may not miss the menus, though. The browser loads quickly, works 
very well with your fingers, and you can easily tap one site’s links to jump to 
another site. The fast-loading browser excels at serving up quick bits of infor­
mation, which is what most people need from the Start screen.
Windows 8.1 adds a lot of power to the Start screen’s browser, and it’s often 
all a Surface owner needs.
Opening the desktop’s Internet Explorer
Opening the Desktop app’s version of Internet Explorer on the Surface takes 
more effort: You won’t find an icon for it on the Start screen. That’s actually 
a good thing because the desktop’s browser is very difficult to use with your 
fingers.
If you have a mouse and keyboard and need to run the desktop’s browser in a 
window, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Start screen, tap or click the Desktop app’s tile.
	
	 The traditional Windows desktop appears.
	
2.	From the taskbar along the desktop’s bottom, tap or click the Internet 
Explorer icon next to the Start button in the screen’s bottom-left 
corner.
Internet Explorer leaps to the screen in its own window.
If you plan on working with your Surface’s desktop more often than the Start 
screen, I cover the desktop version of Internet Explorer — as well as the 
desktop itself — in my 420-page book, Windows 8.1 For Dummies.

Opening the Start Screen 
Browser’s Menus
Like most Start screen apps, the browser app hides its menus. That lets you 
concentrate on the picture rather than the frame. When you need the menus, 
you can reveal them using the same trick that summons the menus from any 
Start screen app:
	
Slide your finger inward from the screen’s top or bottom edges.
As you slide your finger, the App bar comes into view, snapping along the 
screen’s top or bottom edges, as shown in Figure 8-2.

 Chapter 8: Browsing the Web
Each icon on the App bar performs a different task with a tap of your finger:
	
	
✓	Back arrow: Tap this to revisit your previously viewed web page.
	
✓	Address bar: To type a new web address, tap inside the address bar. If 
no keyboard is attached, the touch keyboard appears, ready for you to 
type the address of the website you’d like to visit. (As you type, the area 
above the address bar lists matching names of previously visited sites. 
Spot the name of the site you want to visit? Tap its name to load it.)
	
	The address bar also doubles as a Search box. Type a few keywords and 
press Enter, and Microsoft’s Bing search engine lists websites matching 
your search.
	
	
✓	Cancel/Refresh: As you view a site, this is a Refresh icon; tap it to reload 
the page, retrieving the latest details. While a web page loads, this icon 
becomes a Cancel button; if the site loads slowly, tap the Cancel icon to 
stop trying to load the sluggish site.
	
	
✓	Favorite: Tap this icon, and a list of sites you’ve marked as Favorites 
appears above the address bar. This makes them much easier to launch 
from within the browser, as I explain in this chapter’s “Visiting websites” 
section.
	
	
✓	Add to Favorites: Displayed when viewing your Favorites list, this icon 
lets you add your currently viewed site to your Favorites list.
	
	
✓	Pin to Start: Seen when viewing your Favorites list, this icon places a 
shortcut tile on the Start screen that launches your currently viewed 
site.
	
	
✓	Share: Displayed when viewing your Favorites list, this icon opens the 
Charms bar’s Share icon, where you can share the site with others, place 
it on your Reading List app, post to social networks, or e-mail the site to 
friends.
	
	
✓	Tabs: Tap this icon to replace the Favorites list with a view of your cur­
rently open tabs.
	
	
✓	Page Tools: When a page doesn’t load properly, tap this little wrench 
icon. When the pop-up menu appears, choose View on the Desktop. That 
opens the site in the desktop version of Internet Explorer. (If the wrench 
icon sprouts a plus sign, that means that site offers an app for easier 
access.)
	
	
✓	Forward arrow: After clicking the Back arrow to revisit a site, click the 
Forward arrow to return to the site you just left.
	
	
✓	Tab Menu: Displayed when viewing a list of your currently open tabs, 
this icon brings a pop-up menu with two options: Close tabs, which 
closes all the open tabs, and New InPrivate tab, which opens a new tab 
for browsing in private (covered in the “Browsing in private” sidebar).

✓	Open New Tab: A tap of the plus sign icon in the top right lets you open 
a blank new tab. That tab lets you open a new web page, which is handy 
when you want to compare two websites. (You can jump between the 
sites by tapping their thumbnails on the Tab menu.)
	
	
✓	Reading View: Tap this little book icon, shown at the end of the address 
bar, to strip the web page of cluttering ads and formatting and display 
the page’s content full screen. You can then read it by paging from left to 
right rather than scrolling down. (To return to normal view, tap the icon 
again.)
The Start screen browser may look lightweight, but it provides everything 
you need for casual browsing. As shown in Figure 8-2, the browser lets you 
open several sites simultaneously, each in its own tab.
I describe how to close the Internet Explorer app in Chapter 4, but there’s 
really no need to close Internet Explorer or any other Start screen app. 
They’re designed to stay open constantly, letting you switch between them as 
needed, also described in Chapter 4.
Browsing in private
Most websites leave lasting impressions long 
after they’ve left your eyes. Days or months 
later, the sites’ names can still pop up in your 
address bar as you begin typing a few letters. 
They also linger in your browser’s history of vis­
ited websites. Some even leave behind cached 
photos — copies of viewed photos — on your 
Surface’s hard drive. And they leave behind 
cookies — small files that help websites track 
your visits.
When you want to visit a website without leav­
ing a trace, head for the Start screen browser’s 
InPrivate mode from the Tab menu. InPrivate 
mode lets you shop for holiday presents, visit 
controversial websites, or browse on a public 
computer without letting others know your 
business.
To turn on InPrivate mode on the Start screen’s 
browser, follow these steps:
	 1.	 From the Start screen’s Internet Explorer 
app, slide your finger down slightly from 
the screen’s top edge to reveal the menu.
	 2.	 Tap the Tab menu (it looks like three dots) 
and, when the pop-up menu appears, tap 
New InPrivate tab.
A blank InPrivate window appears in the 
browser, ready for you to browse without leav­
ing a trace on your PC.
The desktop version of Internet Explorer 
requires different steps to enter InPrivate mode:
	 1.	 Tap or click the browser’s Tools icon in its 
upper-right corner. (The icon resembles a 
gear.)
	 2.	 When the drop-down menu appears, 
choose Safety.
	 3.	 When the Safety pop-out menu appears, 
choose InPrivate Browsing.
A new version of Internet Explorer opens, 
showing a window that says InPrivate Is On.
To leave InPrivate mode in either program, just 
close Internet Explorer or close the browser’s 
InPrivate window.

 Chapter 8: Browsing the Web
Navigating a Website with Your Fingers
Being designed specifically for your fingers, the Start screen’s version of 
Internet Explorer works quite well with touch controls. When you’re brows­
ing a website, a well-placed finger lets you perform any of these tasks:
	
✓	Scroll through a web page. When viewing a web page, remember the 
“sliding a piece of paper” rule: Slide your finger up or down the page, 
and the web page travels along the screen with your finger. By sliding 
your finger up or down the page, you can read the entire page, skipping 
up or down a few paragraphs at your own pace.
	
✓	Enlarge tiny text. When the text is too small to read, place two fingertips 
on the screen and spread them. As your fingers move, the information 
expands, enlarging the text. Pinching the screen between two fingertips 
shrinks the page. By stretching and pinching, you find the sweet spot for 
easy visibility of both text and photos. (A quick double-tap makes the 
page fill the screen, letting you pinch or stretch it to your preferred size.)
	
✓	Fetch menus. Slide your finger up slightly from the screen’s bottom or 
down slightly from the screen’s top. A menu pops up along the screen’s 
bottom edge, as shown earlier in Figure 8-2.
	
	
✓	Open a link in a new tab. Hold your finger down on the link until a 
menu appears along the screen’s bottom. From that menu, tap the Open 
in New Tab icon. (Choosing the Open in New Window icon splits the 
screen, snapping a second version of Internet Explorer to the right of 
your current version. I explain snapping apps side-by-side in Chapter 7.)
Using the Start screen’s Internet Explorer with a 
trackpad or mouse
Most of the time, the Start screen’s Internet 
Explorer works just fine with your fingertips. But 
armed with your Surface keyboard’s trackpad 
or a mouse, the app tosses these new moves 
your way:
	✓	Back/Forward: As you browse between 
a string of websites, hover your mouse 
pointer over the currently viewed page’s 
left or right edges. An arrow appears 
along the edge, letting you click to move 
backward or forward, revisiting previously 
viewed pages.
	✓	Opening menus: To fetch the menus from 
Internet Explorer and any Start screen app, 
right-click a blank portion of the web page, 
away from words and pictures, and the 
menus appear.
	✓	Dragging: Some, but not all, websites rec­
ognize dragging. If you find yourself stuck 
at a stubborn website, try using your fingers 
to drag instead.
	
	I explain more about using a trackpad, 
mouse, and keyboard in Chapter 5.

Part II: Connections 
Visiting Websites
You don’t always have to open Internet Explorer to begin browsing. If you spot 
a web link inside a piece of e-mail in the Mail app, for example, tap the link. 
Internet Explorer appears automatically, snapping itself alongside the Mail app to 
display that website. (I describe how to maneuver snapped apps in Chapter 7.)
If you’ve pinned a favorite site to the Start screen with a tap of the App bar’s Pin 
to Start icon, a quick tap of that site’s Start screen tile brings it to the forefront.
When Internet Explorer is onscreen, the app lets you visit sites in other ways, 
as well:
	
	
✓	Return to your last-visited site. Slide a finger inward from the screen’s 
left edge, as if you’re flipping back a page in a book, and the previous page 
returns into view. You can also slide a finger up from screen’s bottom until 
the App bar appears; then tap the left-pointing arrow. (Conversely, a tap 
on the right-pointing arrow returns to the site you left.)
	
✓	Type a site’s address. Slide your finger up the page to fetch the App bar 
and begin typing the site’s name in the address bar, shown earlier in 
Figure 8-2. Press Enter, and the website opens.
	
✓	Search for a site. Type a keyword or phrase directly into the address 
bar and press Enter. Microsoft’s Bing search takes over, listing websites 
that match your searched item.
	
	
✓	Visit a favorite site. When you fetch the App bar and tap the Favorites 
icon (shown in the margin), look directly above the address bar. There, 
Windows lists three categories of sites: Pinned (sites you’ve pinned to 
the Start screen), Frequently Visited, and Favorites (sites you’ve marked 
as favorites). To scroll through them all, slide your finger from right to 
left. Tap a site’s name to revisit it.
	
✓	Revisit a previously visited site. As you begin typing a site’s name in 
the address bar, the browser checks your list of favorite sites, listing 
sites that match what you’re typing. If you spot your desired site’s name 
before you finish typing, tap the site’s name for a quick revisit.
Windows remembers quite a bit about what you do in Internet Explorer. It 
remembers every term you’ve searched for, as well as every site you’ve vis­
ited. Although that sometimes comes in handy when trying to relocate infor­
mation, some view it as an invasion of privacy. Should Internet Explorer grow 
too nosy, read this chapter’s sidebar, “Making Internet Explorer forget.”
You can also avoid the problem by using InPrivate browsing, covered in 
this chapter’s “Browsing in Private” sidebar, to keep Internet Explorer from 
remembering secret visits in the first place.

 Chapter 8: Browsing the Web
Managing Several Sites in Tabs
It’s not obvious, but the Start screen’s version of Internet Explorer often 
keeps several sites open at the same time. For example, while viewing a web­
site, you might visit the Start screen and tap a link you’d pinned there earlier 
for easier access.
The Start screen’s Internet Explorer reappears, now displaying the pinned 
website. What happened to the web page you were viewing previously? The 
browser places it on a hidden tab — a storage place the browser uses to 
juggle several open sites simultaneously.
You can open websites in different tabs, too, a handy trick when you want to 
visit a page but keep the first page open for reference.
To open a link in a new tab, follow this simple step:
	
	 Hold down your finger on a link. When the App bar appears along the 
screen’s bottom, tap the Open in New Tab icon, as shown in Figure 8-3.
To see your currently open tabs, slide your finger up slightly from the bottom 
edge of the Internet Explorer app. When the menus appear, you see thumb­
nails of all the sites currently open in tabs, as shown earlier in Figure 8-2.
	
To revisit a site, tap its name; the browser switches to that tab.
Making Internet Explorer forget
Windows offers two ways to control what your 
browser remembers about the time you spend 
online:
	✓	Manage your search history. To delete 
your search history from the Start screen’s 
version of Internet Explorer, open the 
app. Then fetch the Charms bar and tap 
Settings. When the Settings pane appears, 
tap Options. Finally, when the Options pane 
appears, tap the Select in the History sec­
tion. There, you can tell the App what to 
remember and what to forget.
	✓	Stop Windows from remembering your 
searches. From anywhere within Windows, 
fetch the Charms bar and tap Settings. 
When the Settings pane appears, tap 
Change PC Settings at the pane’s bottom. 
When the PC Settings window appears, tap 
Search and Apps from the left pane. When 
the Search and Apps screen appears, look 
for the Your Search Experience section 
and tap the toggle switch called Don’t Get 
Personalized Results from Bing.
Changes made here also affect the desktop’s 
version of Internet Explorer. That version offers 
additional privacy controls, covered later in this 
chapter.

When a site lives on a tab, it stays there even if you restart your computer. In 
fact, tabbed sites close only if any of these two things happen:
	
✓	You manually close a tabbed site by clicking the X in the thumbnail’s 
lower-right corner.
	
✓	You close the browser manually, usually by swiping your finger from the 
screen’s top edge all the way to the bottom. (The next time you open the 
browser, only your home page appears.)
Making Sites Available with One Tap
Eventually, you’ll run across a site you don’t want to forget. When that hap­
pens, pin the site to your Start screen. Seeing that tile on the Start screen jogs 
your memory that you haven’t visited for a while. And, it lets you remedy 
that with a tap on the tile.
To pin a site to the Start screen, follow these steps:
	
1.	While viewing the site, slide your finger up from the screen’s bottom 
to see the App bar.
	
	 The App bar rises from the screen’s bottom, shown earlier in Figure 8-2.
	
	
2.	 Tap the Pin to Start button.
	
	 Don’t see the Pin to Start button, shown in the margin? Then reveal 
it by tapping the App bar’s Favorites button, which looks like a star. 
www.it-ebooks.info

167
 Chapter 8: Browsing the Web
When you tap the Pin to Start button, the browser quickly creates a 
new tile with the website’s colors and then sticks that tile on the Start 
screen’s far-right edge. (The tile also bears the website’s name.)
When you want to revisit the site, tap its icon from the Start screen. Or, open 
the browser’s bottom menu and tap the address bar; a list of pinned sites 
appears above the address bar, letting you revisit one with a tap on its name.
	
The Start screen always tacks newly pinned sites onto its far-right edge. To 
manage your Start screen’s inevitable sprawl, head for Chapter 4, where I 
describe how to separate the Start screen into organized groups of tiles. (You 
may want to create a separate Start screen group for your favorite websites.)
Sharing Sites and Their Information
Eventually, you stumble upon something worth sharing with friends. It may 
be an entire web page, or it may be just a recipe’s ingredients and instruc­
tions from a cooking site.
In previous Windows versions, you’d probably have reached for the age-old 
copy-and-paste trick to shuttle the information to your friends.
Windows now updates that maneuver with the easier-to-use Share icon. 
Sharing items begins with a trip to the Charms bar:
	
	 Fetch the Charms bar by sliding your finger in from the right edge and then 
tapping the Share icon, shown in the margin.
When the Share pane appears, shown in Figure 8-4, you see every app capa­
ble of sharing your screen’s current contents. For example, tap the Mail icon, 
and the Sharing pane shows the Mail app, letting you type an e-mail address 
and send the page on its way.
The Share pane usually shows these items:
	
	
✓	Mail: Tap this option to e-mail your currently viewed link to a friend.
	
	
✓	Music: In a surreal experiment, the Music app scans the website and 
creates an Xbox Music playlist based on the site’s words. (I cover Xbox 
Music in Chapter 11.)
	
	
✓	OneNote: On the Surface RT and Surface 2, this option sends the page 
to OneNote for later reading. (It does the same on the Surface Pro and 
Surface Pro 2 only if you’ve installed OneNote.)

✓	Reading List: New to Windows 8.1, this option saves the page to your 
Reading List app, where you can refer to it later, even when away from 
the Internet.
Tap any app’s icon, and the app appears along the screen’s right edge, ready 
to lead you through the steps of sharing the page’s information in its own 
particular way. Tap People, for example, and the app leads you through the 
steps of sharing the link through a post on Facebook or Twitter.
Tap Reading List, and the Reading List app asks you to list a category for the 
site and then files it away for later reading.
You may see more apps listed here, depending on how often you’ve shopped at 
the Windows Store. However, not all apps can share, and some apps share infor­
mation in limited ways. If a tap of the Sharing icon doesn’t let you share some­
thing, the app’s creator probably doesn’t want that information to be shared.
Downloading Files and Photos
The Start screen’s Internet Explorer app can download files and photos, just 
like its full-sized cousin on the desktop.
For example, to download a file from a website, tap the website’s download 
button. A permission bar appears along the screen’s bottom, shown in Figure 8-5.

Depending on what you’re trying to download, the permission bar offers dif­
ferent options:
	
✓	Run: Tap this option if you’re downloading a program to install onto 
your Surface Pro or Surface Pro 2 tablet. The browser downloads the 
program and then automatically installs it, leaving its icon on the desk­
top or in the Start screen’s All Apps area.
	
✓	Open: This downloads and opens the item for viewing or installing.
	
✓	Save: This saves the file in your Downloads folder, which is handy when 
you’re downloading something you want to access later.
	
✓	Cancel: Tapped a Download button by mistake? A well-placed tap on the 
Cancel button stops the download.
	
	 To find your downloaded file in the Downloads folder, slide your finger down 
from the screen’s top edge to open the App bar and then tap the Page tools 
icon, shown in the margin. When the pop-up menu appears, choose View 
Downloads to see a list of your downloaded files.

Changing Settings
The Start screen browser, like nearly all apps, lets you tweak its settings to 
meet your particular needs. And, just as with all apps, opening the settings 
area begins with a trip to the Charms bar, described in these steps:
	
	
1.	 Fetch the Charms bar by sliding your finger inward from the screen’s 
right edge. Tap the Settings icon.
	
	 The Settings pane appears.
	
2.	Tap the word Options near the top of the Settings pane.
	
	 The Options pane appears, as shown in Figure 8-6. The Internet Explorer 
app is built for speed rather than power, so it lets you change only these 
things:
 
• Appearance: Head here, and a toggle switch lets you make the App 
bar stay put so you can always see the menus. The Zoom option’s 
sliding bar lets you choose the magnification level to view sites. If 
you’ve set up the desktop to enlarge the screen by 125 percent, as 
I describe in Chapter 12, this bar will be set at 125. That’s fine for 
most websites — you can always pinch or stretch them to the size 
that best displays their content.
 
• Home pages: Tap this section’s Customize button to add your cur­
rently viewed site or sites to your Home page tabs. Those tabs will 
automatically load whenever you open the browser.

• History: Don’t want anybody to see websites you’ve browsed? 
Tap this section’s Select button to delete cached images, cookies, 
browsing history, download history, and other items.
 
• Passwords: Normally, the browser remembers your usernames and 
passwords, sparing you from typing them at every visit. This sec­
tion lets people with perfect memories turn off that feature, as well 
as manage previously saved passwords.
 
• Phone numbers: This feature lets you detect phone numbers on 
websites so you can dial them by using your Surface’s built-in 
Skype program.
 
• Fonts and Encoding: Helpful mainly to bilingual Surface owners, 
this area lets you change how the browser displays sites contain­
ing foreign languages.
	
3.	Tap anywhere on the web page to close the Options pane and return 
to browsing.
Your changes to the Internet Explorer app’s settings take place immediately.
Turning on Flip Ahead
Start screen apps usually move their pages 
across the screen horizontally. That lets you 
swipe your finger in from right to left to move to 
the next page, much like you do when reading 
a book.
Websites, by contrast, expect you to move 
down the page, which is contrary to the 
Windows movements.
The solution? Microsoft’s Flip Ahead technol­
ogy purports to fix things. When you turn on Flip 
Ahead, Microsoft reformats web pages in the 
background as they flow onto your screen. To 
scroll down the page, just flip your finger from 
right to left, like turning a book’s page. Your 
Surface quickly reformats the website, present­
ing the portion that dangled off the page as a 
new page, ready for reading.
Although this makes web browsing more like 
flipping magazine pages, the cost is a loss of 
privacy. Turning it on sends Microsoft a link to 
every web page you visit, which allows them to 
format the pages in advance. If you’re not con­
cerned about privacy, though, it might enhance 
your web browsing experience.
It can also break the natural flow of some 
websites, leaving awkward page breaks. To 
try out Flip Ahead, visit the Internet Explorer 
app’s Settings area, described in the previous 
section, but tap Privacy instead of Options. 
There, you can toggle on Flip Ahead with Page 
Prediction.
Beware, however: Even when turned on, the 
Flip Ahead feature won’t work for every site.

Sending a Site to the 
Desktop’s Browser
Not all sites display properly in the Start screen’s minimalist, finger-friendly 
browser. Some sites don’t show everything, for example; other sites format 
the page as if you were browsing from a smartphone. Still others protest with 
cryptic error messages that leave you with frustration rather than solutions.
Instead of giving up and moving on to another site, try routing the site to 
the desktop’s more powerful browser, which specializes in coddling cranky 
websites.
To route a misbehaving site to the desktop’s web browser, follow these steps:
	
1.	Swipe your finger up from the screen’s bottom to fetch the browser 
menu.
	
2.	From the browser’s bottom menu, tap the Settings icon.
Set ting your home page in the desktop’s browser
Many of the settings made in one browser 
apply to the other browser, as well. For exam­
ple, you can set your home page — the page 
your browser shows upon opening — in the 
Desktop’s browser, and the Start screen’s ver­
sion of Internet Explorer will also open to that 
home page.
To set your home page on the desktop version 
of Internet Explorer, follow these steps:
	 1.	 With the desktop version of Internet 
Explorer, visit the site you’d like to see 
when you first open either browser.
	
	 Visit your favorite site by typing its address 
into Internet Explorer or clicking a link.
	 2.	 Click the Tools icon in the program’s upper-
right corner. (It looks like a gear.)
	 3.	 When the drop-down menu appears, 
choose Internet Options.
	 4.	 When the Internet Options page opens 
to the General tab, click or tap the Use 
Current button.
That sets your currently viewed page as your 
home page. Once you close and re-open either 
version of Internet Explorer, it will open to show 
that page.
Because both browsers can show several sites 
simultaneously in separate tabs, you can also 
open different sites in the desktop version of 
Internet Explorer. When you tap or click the Use 
Current button in Step 4, it adds all of those sites 
to your home page, and they each open every 
time you open either version of Internet Explorer.

that instead. That takes you to the Windows Store, where you can down­
load an app that accesses the site, translating it into a more finger-friendly

obody enjoys typing their friends’ names and e-mail addresses into 
Yet Another New Computer. And the thought of typing them all in on a 
glass keyboard probably makes you give serious thought to buying a click-on 
keyboard.
Chances are good, though, that you won’t have to type them all. Windows 
automatically adds your friends’ contact information into your Surface, and it 
stashes your upcoming appointments into your calendar.
Your Surface works its magic by grabbing your friends’ information from 
your social networks. Tell Windows about your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, 
Google, and other accounts, and your Surface automatically harvests your 
friends’ names and contact information. As your Surface searches your social 
networks for your friends’ information, Windows also grabs your friends’ 
latest status updates for quick reading.
The end result? When you open the People and Calendar apps on your new 
Surface, your friends already appear. Yes, after several decades, computers 
are finally making some things easier.

Part II: Connections 
Adding Your Social Accounts to Windows
Before you can run your Surface’s core apps — Mail, People, Calendar, and 
Skype — you need a Microsoft account. (I explain Microsoft accounts in 
Chapter 3.) Without a Microsoft account, most apps simply display a notice 
telling you to sign up or switch to a Microsoft account. (Tap those nagging 
words to sign up for a Microsoft account on the spot.)
Those core apps need something else, too: your username and password 
information from Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Hotmail, and other 
accounts you may use.
Although handing over your password sounds fishy, it’s actually safe, secure, 
and quite convenient on your Surface. Armed with your social networking 
information, the People app dutifully stocks itself with everybody’s contact 
information.
When you open the People app and view people’s entries, you see their contact 
information, as well as their latest posts and photos from Facebook and Twitter.
To let your Surface grab the information that’s currently scattered across 
your social networks, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Start screen, open the Mail app.
	
	 From the Start screen, tap the Mail app’s tile, and the Mail app fills the 
screen, listing any mail you’ve received from your Microsoft account.
	
2.	Tell the Mail app about your other accounts.
	
	
	 To add your accounts to the Mail app, head for the Charms bar’s Settings 
icon: Summon the Charms bar by swiping your finger inward from the 
screen’s right edge and then tap the Settings icon (shown in the margin).
	
	 When the Settings pane appears, tap the word Accounts, and the Accounts 
pane appears, listing your Microsoft account. From the Accounts pane, tap 
the Add an Account link, and the Mail app lists the accounts you can add, 
as shown in Figure 9-1.
	
	 When you enter the username and password for some mail accounts, 
the Mail app simply collects any waiting mail. For other mail accounts, 
such as Gmail, the Mail app takes you to a secure area on the Google 
website where you authorize the transaction.
	
	 Repeat these steps for other e-mail accounts you want to add to the Mail 
app.
	
	 Don’t see your e-mail account listed? I explain how to add missing e-mail 
accounts in this chapter’s sidebar, “Adding other e-mail accounts to Mail.”

	 Unfortunately, the Mail app doesn’t accept POP mail servers, which 
are offered by many ISPs. To add IMAP servers, tap the Other Account 
option and enter your username, password, and the name of your IMAP 
servers. Don’t know whether your mail account uses POP or IMAP? 
Contact your ISP and ask which one it uses for your e-mail.
Figure 9-1: 
On its right

3.	Return to the Start screen, tap the People tile, and enter your other 
accounts.
	
	 When the People app first opens, you may already see a few of your 
friends, grabbed from online contact lists associated with the e-mail 
accounts you entered in the previous step.
	
	
	 To stock the app with more of your friends, tell the People app about 
your social networking sites, like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and 
others. Open the People app, summon the Charms bar by sliding your 
finger inward from the screen’s right edge and then tap the Settings icon 
(shown in the margin).
	
	 When the Settings pane appears, tap the word Accounts, and the Accounts 
pane appears, listing your Microsoft account. From the Accounts pane, tap 
the Add an Account link, and the People app lists the accounts you can 
add, just as the Mail app did back in Figure 9-1.
	
	 Your importing experience will vary from account to account. For some 
accounts, you simply need to enter your username and password. Other 
accounts, such as Facebook, take you straight to Facebook’s website, 
where you enter your information to authorize the action, as shown in 
Figure 9-2.

After you enter your account information, Windows finishes the job, filling 
your Mail app with e-mail, stocking the People app with your friends’ contact 
information, and adding any appointments to your Calendar app.
	
✓	Your contact list updates automatically, constantly reflecting your 
relationships on Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. If you manually add a 
contact to one of your online networks from any computer, that person’s 
information automatically appears in your Surface’s People app, as well.
	
✓	If somebody unfriends you from Facebook, or if you stop following some­
body on Twitter, your People app silently erases them without notice.
	
✓	In addition to collecting contact information, the People app collects 
your friends’ latest updates from all of your linked social networks. 
When you visit the People app’s What’s New section, you can read every­
one’s updates from every network without your having to visit them all.
	
✓	You can still visit the websites of Facebook and other networks to read 
your friends’ updates. You can also download the Facebook app and 
visit your friends’ updates through the app. The People app simply pro­
vides yet another way to keep track of your friends’ lives.
Sending and Receiving E-Mail
The Mail app does a no-frills job of sending and receiving e-mail. It’s free, pre-
installed, includes a spell checker, and, if you follow the steps in the previous 
section, it’s already filled with the e-mail addresses of your friends.

 Chapter 9: Reaching Out with Mail, People, Calendar, and Skype
In fact, you don’t even need to open the Mail app to see what’s new. The Mail 
app includes a live tile, meaning it constantly updates with the latest infor­
mation. When you glance at the Start screen, your Mail tile behaves like a 
mini-billboard, displaying the first few lines of your unread e-mails and their 
senders’ names.
The following sections explain how to open the Mail app, send and receive 
e-mail, switch between folders and accounts, and send and receive files to 
friends or co-workers.
Adding other e-mail accounts to Mail
The Mail app sends and receives e-mail only 
from the accounts listed in the Accounts pane 
described early in this chapter, which includes 
e-mail from Outlook.com, Exchange (used by 
some businesses), Google’s Gmail, America 
Online, and Yahoo!.
If you want to access mail from other accounts, 
you can launch Internet Explorer with a tap of 
its Start screen tile. Then visit your mail serv­
er’s website to send and receive e-mail online. 
This trick bypasses the Mail app, but it’s an 
easy solution.
Owners of a Surface RT or Surface 2 can also 
use the built-in version of Outlook on the desk­
top, which handles POP accounts.
But if you’d rather stick with the Mail app for its 
finger-friendly interface, follow these steps to add 
unsupported e-mail accounts to the Mail app:
	 1.	 Open Internet Explorer, visit Outlook 
(www.outlook.com), and either log in 
with your Microsoft account or sign up for 
an Outlook.com e-mail address.
	 2.	 Open Settings area on Outlook.com and then 
add your unsupported e-mail addresses.
	
	 On Outlook.com, click the Settings icon 
(the little gear) and choose More Mail 
Settings from the drop-down menu. On the 
More Mail Settings page, find the setting 
for adding other e-mail accounts. There, 
you need to enter your unsupported mail 
account’s username and password as well 
as its type of mail servers, which usually 
contain the cryptic words POP3 and SMTP. 
Save your changes.
	 3.	 In the Mail app, select Outlook as your 
e-mail program and enter your Outlook 
e-mail addresses name and password.
	
	 Then, Outlook.com automatically grabs 
e-mail from your unsupported POP accounts 
and routes them to your Outlook.com 
account in the Mail app, letting you read 
everything in one place.
You can also call your ISP and ask when it plans 
to support IMAP. (IMAP is pronounced just like 
it sounds.) The Mail app works fine with IMAP 
accounts, sparing you from jumping through 
this sidebar’s admittedly uncomfortable hoops.
Also, Surface RT and Surface 2 owners can 
also use the Outlook desktop program for their 
e-mail. Being more powerful than the Mail app, 
Outlook can handle POP and SMTP accounts. I 
explain how to add e-mail accounts to Outlook 
in Chapter 13.

Switching between the Mail app’s 
accounts, folders, and e-mail
A tap on the Mail app’s Start screen tile brings the Mail app to the screen, shown 
in Figure 9-3. Even if the Mail app is already running in the background, a tap on 
its Start screen tile brings it front and center.
Figure 9-3: 
The Mail 
app sepa-
rates your 
e-mail into 
three col-
umns. Your 
currently 
selected 
e-mail spills 
out along 
the right 
edge.
The Mail app splits the screen into three columns:
	
✓	Left column: The name of your currently viewed e-mail account appears 
in the top; that account’s folders appear below its name. (You’re cur­
rently viewing the highlighted folder.) At the column’s bottom, you see 
names of any other e-mail accounts you’ve set up. To view mail from 
another account’s mail, tap that account’s name.
www.it-ebooks.info

181
 Chapter 9: Reaching Out with Mail, People, Calendar, and Skype
	
✓	Middle column: Tap a folder from the left column, and a list of that fold­
er’s e-mails appears in the middle column. There, you see the sender’s 
name, the e-mail’s arrival date, and the subject name.
	
✓	Right column: Tap an e-mail listed in the middle column, and its con­
tents spill out in the right column.
To browse your mail, follow these two steps:
	
1.	From the left column, tap the account and then the folder you want to 
browse.
	
	 When you tap the folder, its contents appear in the middle column.
	
2.	From the middle column, tap the e-mail you want to read.
	
	 The message’s contents spill out into the right column.
	
Can’t read an e-mail’s tiny letters? Then put two fingers on the screen to 
stretch or pinch it until it’s the right size for your eyes.
Figure 9-3, for example, shows a Hotmail account in the left column. Beneath 
it, you see other available accounts, including one from Yahoo!. (If you set up 
only one account, you see only one account listed.)
The folders vary between e-mail accounts. If you’ve set up customized fold­
ers in Gmail, for example, those same customized folders appear in the Mail 
app. But every account always contains these basic folders:
	
	
✓	Inbox: When you open the Mail app or switch between accounts, you 
always see the contents of your Inbox — the holding tank for newly 
received messages. The Mail app only shows your last few weeks of mes­
sages; I show how to change that time frame in this chapter’s sidebar, 
“Changing an account’s settings.”
	
	
✓	Favorites: Tap this area to see e-mail from people you’ve marked as 
Favorites in the People app. (I describe the People app in its own sec­
tion, later in this chapter.)
	
	
✓	Flagged: To mark an e-mail for later attention, flag it: Slide your finger 
inward from the screen’s top or bottom edge to fetch the App bar, and 
then tap the Flag icon. The Mail app stores flagged messages here for 
easy access.
	
Like all apps, the Mail app hides its menus. To reveal them, slide your finger 
inward from the screen’s bottom or top edge. Slide up from the bottom, for 
example, and the App bar appears, with all the app’s menus in tow. The App 
bar is context-sensitive, meaning it changes to show icons relevant to what 
you’re currently viewing.

Composing and sending an e-mail
To write, spellcheck, and send an e-mail from your Surface’s Mail app to a 
friend’s Inbox, follow these steps:
	
	
1.	 From the Start screen, tap the Mail app’s tile and then tap the New 
icon in the program’s top-right corner.
	
	 An empty New Message window appears, ready for you to fill with your 
words of glory. If you’ve set up several e-mail accounts in the Mail app, 
your e-mail will be sent from the account you last viewed.
	
	 To send e-mail from a different e-mail account, delete that message by tap­
ping the Delete icon (shaped like a trash can) in the screen’s upper-right 
corner. Then switch to your desired account by tapping its name from the 
program’s bottommost left corner. When your preferred account appears, 
tap the New icon to send an e-mail from that account instead.
	
2.	Add your friend’s e-mail address into the To box.
	
	 Tap the word To next to the To box. The People app appears, letting 
you tap the name of everybody you want to receive the e-mail. Tap the 
Add button, and the Mail app automatically fills in everybody’s e-mail 
address — a very handy thing on a tablet.
Changing an account’s settings
Most e-mail accounts in the Mail app let you 
customize how they handle your mail. For exam­
ple, most accounts contain hundreds if not thou­
sands of e-mails. That’s a lot of e-mail to sort 
through. To keep things simple and conserve 
storage space, the Mail app displays only a few 
weeks’ worth of both sent and received e-mail.
To change that time frame — or to change the 
settings of any mail account — open the Mail 
app and follow these steps:
	 1.	 Fetch the Charms bar by sliding your finger 
in from the screen’s right edge and then tap 
the Settings icon.
	 2.	 When the Settings pane appears, tap 
Accounts. When the Accounts pane lists 
your e-mail accounts, tap the account you’d 
like to change.
	
	 The settings for your chosen account 
appear, ready for you to make your changes. 
(To bring more of the Settings pane into view, 
slide your finger up or down the screen.)
	 3.	 Tap in the area you’d like to change and 
then change the setting by tapping the 
adjacent toggle switch, tapping an item 
from a menu, or typing in words.
	
	 For example, to change the amount of down­
loaded mail, find the Download Email From 
drop-down menu. There, you can choose 
a time frame between three days and “any 
time,” which downloads all of your mail. 
Your settings changes take place immedi­
ately; you don’t need to tap a Save button.
To remove an account you no longer use, tap 
the Remove account button at the bottom of 
that account’s Settings pane.
To close the Accounts pane, tap anywhere 
within the Mail app.

	 Or, you can tap inside the To box and type the recipient’s name or e-mail 
address. With each letter you type, the Mail app scans the contacts 
listed in your People app, constantly placing potential matches below 
the To box. If the app happens to guess the right name, tap the name to 
place it in the To box.
	
3.	Tap inside the Subject box and type in a subject.
	
	 Tap the words Add a Subject along the message’s top; those words 
quickly vanish, letting you type your own subject, as shown at the top of 
Figure 9-4.

4.	Type your message into the large box beneath the Subject line.
	
	 Head to Chapter 5 for typing tips for both the Surface’s Type and Touch 
Cover keyboards, as well as the Surface’s built-in keyboard. The Mail app 
watches as you type, automatically underlining words it doesn’t recog­
nize. To correct a misspelled word, tap the underlined word. A pop-up 
menu appears, as shown in Figure 9-4, letting you choose the correct 
spelling. (Choose Add to Dictionary to add a word that’s unrecognized 
but correctly spelled.)
	
	 To embellish your prose, change the text’s formatting by swiping your 
finger upward from the screen’s bottom to fetch the App bar. Shown 
along the bottom of Figure 9-4, the App bar lets you change fonts, add 
italics, create numbered lists, and add other flourishes by tapping the 
appropriate icon.
	
5.	Attach any files or photos to your e-mail, if desired.
	
	
	 I devote a section, “Sending and receiving files through e-mail,” to this 
topic later in this chapter, but here’s the gist: Tap the Attachments icon 
on the Mail app’s App bar. The File Picker appears, letting you navigate 
to your file’s location, tap the file’s name, and tap the Attach button.
	
	
6.	 Tap the Send button, located in the screen’s top-right corner.
	
	 The Mail app slides your e-mail through the Internet’s blend of fiber-
optics, radio waves, and copper wires into your friend’s mailbox. 
Depending on the speed of your Internet connection, mail can arrive 
anywhere from within a few seconds to a few hours, with a minute or 
two being the average.
	
	
	 If you find yourself at a loss for words, slide your finger up from the 
screen’s bottom edge and then tap the Save Draft button. The Mail app 
stashes your unfinished e-mail into your current account’s Drafts folder 
for later polishing.
Reading an e-mail
Every time your Surface finds itself connected with the Internet, it automati­
cally grabs any new e-mails it can find. Proud of its background work, the 
Mail app’s Start screen tile updates itself, listing the sender, subject, and first 
line of your latest few e-mails.
To respond to a particularly enticing e-mail, follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap the Start screen’s Mail tile.
	
	 The Mail app appears, displaying the newest e-mail in your last-viewed 
account’s Inbox, shown earlier in Figure 9-3. Below that, older e-mails 
appear, listed chronologically.
www.it-ebooks.info

185
 Chapter 9: Reaching Out with Mail, People, Calendar, and Skype
	
2.	Open a message by tapping its name.
	
	 The message’s contents fill the window’s right edge.
	
3.	Tap an option from the buttons along the e-mail’s top edge:
 
• Do nothing: If the message doesn’t warrant a response, move on 
to something more interesting by tapping a different message from 
the Mail app’s middle column.
	
 
• Respond: To reply to a message, tap the Respond button in the 
screen’s top-right corner. When the menu drops down, tap Reply. 
A new e-mail appears, pre-addressed with the recipient’s name 
and subject and containing the original message for you both to 
reference.
	
 
• Reply All: When an e-mail arrives that’s been addressed to several 
people, tap the Respond button but choose Reply All from the 
drop-down menu. That sends your response to everybody who 
received the original e-mail.
	
 
• Forward: Choose Forward from the Respond button’s drop-down 
menu to send a copy of your friend’s must-see cute cat photo to 
your own friends.
	
 
• Delete: To delete a message, tap the Delete icon. The message, 
having no place left to hide, vanishes.
You can print a message the same way you print from any other app: Open 
the message, fetch the Charms bar, tap the Devices icon, tap your printer 
from the list of devices, and tap the Print button.
Selecting e-mails and moving them to a folder
The Mail app seems incredibly frustrating when 
it comes to this simple task: How do you select 
several e-mails and move them to a different 
folder? However, when you know the trick, it’s 
surprisingly easy: Select one e-mail by tapping 
on it. Then, tap the little box that appears along 
the mail’s right edge. When you tap the box, a 
check mark appears inside, showing that the 
e-mail is selected. Plus, empty check boxes 
appear next to all of your other e-mails.
After the boxes appear, you can select more 
e-mails by tapping their boxes.
Select as many e-mails in a column as you 
want. When you select one e-mail, the Mail 
app’s menu appears automatically along the 
bottom. Tap the Move icon, select a destination 
folder, and you’re through.
You can even add a folder to the Mail app. Just 
slide your finger down from the top to fetch the 
App bar, tap Manage Folders from the bottom 
menu, and choose Create Folder or Create 
Subfolder from the pop-up menu.
www.it-ebooks.info

Part II: Connections 
Even though the Mail app gathers your e-mail, you can still view your e-mail 
from your mail service’s website in Internet Explorer. Your same e-mails still 
appear in Gmail (www.google.com/gmail), for example, or Hotmail (www.
hotmail.com).
	
To avoid hogging space on your Surface, many e-mail accounts display only 
your latest few weeks’ worth of messages in the Mail app. After that deadline, 
the files scroll off your Surface’s Mail app.
Sending and receiving files through e-mail
Files, referred to as attachments by computer linguists, can be tucked inside 
an e-mail message. You can send or receive nearly any file, but with a few 
stipulations:
	
✓	Most mail servers — the computers that process mail — can’t handle 
files totaling more than 25MB. So, you can usually send a song or two, 
a handful of digital photos, and most documents. That’s usually not 
enough to send videos, however.
	
✓	If you send a Microsoft Word file and the recipients don’t have Microsoft 
Word, they won’t be able to open or edit your file. To avoid confusion, 
let the recipient know what program you used.
With those two stipulations out of the way, plunge onward into the following 
sections, which explain how to open, save, and send attachments.
Viewing or saving a received attachment
When somebody attaches a file or two to your incoming e-mail, the Mail app 
lets you know with two signals:
	
✓	Messages bearing attachments include a tiny paperclip icon next to their 
subjects. (The paperclip appears in the Mail app’s second column.)
	
✓	When you open an e-mail with an attachment, an icon appears, showing 
what’s been attached. For example, an attached photo will appear as a 
thumbnail-sized preview icon; a PDF file will appear with the icon for the 
Reader app, which is your Surface’s app for displaying PDF files.
To open or save the file or files attached to the e-mail you’re reading, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Tap the icon representing the attached file.
	
	 If you just want to view the attached file (or play an attached song), tap 
the file’s icon. If your Surface has an app or a program capable of open­
ing the file, the file opens in a new window to the right of the Mail app, 
letting you see or listen to the attachment.
www.it-ebooks.info

187
 Chapter 9: Reaching Out with Mail, People, Calendar, and Skype
	
	 If your Surface can’t open the attachment, it displays the message, “We 
Can’t Open This File.” If you see that message, write back to the sender, 
saying you can’t open the file.
	
	 After you’ve seen or heard the file, you may be done and ready for differ­
ent adventures. But if you want to save the file for later access on your 
Surface, give the attached file a more permanent home by moving to 
Step 2.
	
2.	Tap and hold the attached file’s icon and tap Save or Download from 
the drop-down menu.
	
	 Windows’s File Picker appears, shown in Figure 9-5. Covered in Chapter 4, 
the File Picker serves as the Start screen’s equivalent of the desktop’s 
File Explorer: It lets you shuttle files from one place to another.
Figure 9-5: 
To save a 
file sent 
through 
e-mail, tap 
This PC, 
navigate to 
a location to 
save the file, 
and then 
tap the Save 
button.
	
3.	Choose a folder to receive the saved file.
	
	 Tap the word This PC in the File Picker’s top-left corner, and a drop-
down menu of your Surface’s available storage areas appears. Depending 
on your Surface’s connections, you may see any or all of these items: 
OneDrive, This PC, Libraries, Homegroup, and Network. Tap the name of 
the place you’d like to save the attached file.
	
	 To store the file on one of your Surface’s libraries, for example, choose 
Libraries or This PC from the drop-down menu. When the File Picker 
lists your Surface’s available libraries, tap the name of the library where 
you’d like to store the file: Documents, Pictures, Music, or Videos.
	
	 Don’t know where to stash an attached file? Choose the Documents 
folder or library, which serves as a catch-all for anything that’s not a 
photo, song, or movie.
www.it-ebooks.info

188
Part II: Connections 
	
4.	Tap the Save button in the File Picker’s lower-right corner.
	
	 After you’ve chosen the file’s destination, the File Picker places a copy of 
the e-mailed file in that location.
	
	 Windows 8.1’s built-in virus checker, Windows Defender, automatically 
scans your incoming e-mail for viruses, worms, and other malware.
	
✓	Even after you save the file to a folder, it remains stored in your e-mail. If 
you somehow lose your saved file, revisit the original e-mail and repeat 
these steps to save a fresh copy.
	
✓	If you need an attachment you received long ago, it’s probably not lost 
forever, even if it’s scrolled off the Mail app. Try visiting your e-mail’s 
website. Some sites such as Outlook.com and Gmail let you access all 
your e-mails, no matter how old they are.
Sending a file as an attachment
Sending a file through the Mail app works just the opposite of saving an attached 
file, covered in the previous section. Instead of finding a place to save an 
e-mailed file, you’re finding a file on your Surface and saving it inside an e-mail.
To send a file through the Mail app, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Mail app and tap the New icon (shown in the margin), as 
described earlier in this chapter’s “Composing and sending an e-mail” 
section.
	
	 Choose the recipient and write your message.
	
2.	Tap the Attachments icon.
	
	
	 Tap the Attachments icon (shown in the margin), and the File Picker 
appears, shown earlier in Figure 9-5.
	
3.	Navigate to the file you’d like to send.
	
	 Tap the word This PC to see a drop-down menu listing popular storage 
areas: OneDrive, This PC, Homegroup, Libraries, and Network. To send a 
file stored on your Surface, tap This PC or Libraries.
	
	 Tap any storage area’s name to see a list of the files stored inside. Don’t 
see the files you want? Tap the File Picker’s Go Up link to retreat from 
that spot and try again with a different location.
	
	 Keep tapping until you navigate to your file’s location, usually stored in 
your Documents, Pictures, Music, or Videos folder.
	
4.	Tap the name of each file you want to send and then tap the Attach 
button.
	
	 A tap selects a file; tap a file again to deselect it. As you tap files, their 
color changes to show that they’re selected.
www.it-ebooks.info

189
 Chapter 9: Reaching Out with Mail, People, Calendar, and Skype
	
	 A tap of the Attach button returns to the Mail app and attaches the file 
or files to your e-mail.
	
	
5.	 In the Mail app, tap the Send button.
	
	 The Mail app sends your mail and its attached file or files to the recipi­
ent. Depending on the size of your attached files, this may take from 
several seconds to several minutes. The Mail app does its work in the 
background, so feel free to switch to another app, browse the web, or 
grab another bagel at your free Wi-Fi spot.
	
	 Most e-mail providers won’t send large attachments. You can usually send 
documents without a problem, as well as a handful of photos. But you won’t 
be able to send anything bigger than small movie clips.
Managing Your Contacts 
in the People App
I explain in this chapter’s first section how to link the People app with your 
online social networks. Your People app then stocks itself with your favorite 
people from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other networks.
To see them, open the People app with a tap on its Start screen tile. The 
People app appears, shown in Figure 9-6, listing every friend grabbed from 
your online social networks. And, in keeping with the latest computing trend, 
People alphabetizes your contacts by their first names. Your friend Adam 
Zachman finally appears first.
I can’t find an e-mail!
Instead of envelopes piling up on a table, e-mail 
now piles up in your Inbox. And, if you’ve set up 
several e-mail accounts, mail can be hiding in 
several different Inboxes. You can relocate a 
wayward e-mail in the Mail app, but it’s not easy.
From within Windows Mail, tap the account hold­
ing the e-mail you want to search for. Then tap 
the Magnifying Glass icon near the upper-right 
corner of the Mail app’s middle pane — the pane 
displaying the subject line of each message.
When the Search pane appears, type a word 
you recall seeing in your lost e-mail — even the 
person’s name will do — and then press Enter; 
the Mail app fetches a list of e-mail containing 
that specific word.
At the time of this writing, the Mail app doesn’t 
provide a way to search through all your e-mail 
accounts simultaneously. To search through 
all of your e-mail accounts, you must use the 
Search command on each individual account.

Tapping

places on 
the People 
app lets you 
keep up 
with your 
contacts, 
including 
those pulled 
in from your 
social media

The People app updates itself automatically, adding and dropping people 
as they enter or leave your social networks. It also lets you mark people as 
Favorites so their tiles appear front and center for easy access.
If you create an extraordinary cat photo, you can post it directly onto Twitter 
or Facebook by tapping your own entry in the People app and then filling out 
your personalized What’s New section.
The People app’s reliance on social networking comes with a downside, 
though. Friends who don’t share their lives through a social network stay out 
of reach of the People app. Also, networks such as Facebook contain huge 
switchboxes full of privacy controls. Some of your friends may have flipped 
a Facebook switch that keeps their information sequestered in Facebook’s 
walled garden, safely hidden from the People app.

The point? You eventually need to remove your gloves and manually add or 
edit entries in the People app. This section explains the details of a job that 
can’t be sloughed off to the People app’s robotic trawler.
	
To explore the People app, try these tips first:
	
✓	The People app’s first column shows your profile photo and your notifi­
cations. The second column shows people you’ve marked as Favorites, 
making them easier to access with a tap on their profile photos. The 
third column displays only letters; tap a letter to jump to the contacts 
beginning with that letter.
	
✓	To post your Facebook status, tap your profile photo in the People app’s 
upper-left corner. Then type your message in the What’s On Your Mind 
box. (To send the message to Twitter, tap the Facebook link and choose 
Twitter from the drop-down menu.)
	
✓	To see everybody’s latest updates from Facebook and Twitter, tap the 
What’s New link in the bottom of the second column.
	
✓	Tapping your way through the People app’s What’s New section can 
lead you to friends, their adventures, and even the adventures of your 
friends’ friends. If you’re feeling lost in a sea of people, slide your finger 
up from the screen’s bottom edge and tap the Home button. That takes

Adding contacts to the People app
When somebody doesn’t appear in your People app, you can add her in 
either of two ways:
	
✓	Using any computer, add the missing person to the contacts list of one of 
your online accounts, like Gmail (www.google.com/gmail) or Outlook 
(www.outlook.com). Befriending people on Facebook adds them to the 
People app, too, as does following them on Twitter. After a person appears 
in a social network or one of your linked online contact lists, the People 
app automatically pulls that person’s shared details into your Surface.
	
✓	Manually type your contact’s information into the People app. This isn’t 
a one-way street, either; the People app adds your hand-typed informa­
tion to the online account of your choice, too.
To type a new contact into the People app, follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap the Start screen’s People tile to load the People app.
	
2.	When the People app appears, make sure you’re on the home page: Slide 
your finger up from the screen’s bottom edge and tap the Home icon.

3.	 Slide your finger up slightly from the screen’s bottom edge to fetch 
the App bar. Then tap the New icon.
	
	 Like many apps, the People app includes an App bar along both the 
top and bottom edges; the New icon lives alone on the bottom menu. 
A tap of the New icon reveals a blank New Contact form, as shown in 
Figure 9-7, ready for you to type your contact’s details.
Figure 9-7:

to add the 
person to

app.
	
4.	Fill out the New Contact form.
	
	 Type your contact’s details, including name, address, e-mail, and phone. 
To add other information, tap the Other Info button. There, you can add 
tidbits such as a job title, website, significant other, or notes that don’t 
fit anywhere else.
	
	 If you’ve added more than one online account to your People app, you 
need to choose which account should receive the new contact’s details. 
To choose the account, tap on the Account field in the top left corner. 
There, you can choose between Outlook.com or Live.com, among 
others. To add the contact to your Gmail contacts, you must add the 
information manually online at Google’s Mail website (www.google.
com/gmail).
	
	
5.	 Tap the Save button.
The People app saves your new contact, both on your Surface and on the 
online account you chose in Step 3. Spot a typo? In the next section, I explain 
how to edit an existing contact.

 Chapter 9: Reaching Out with Mail, People, Calendar, and Skype
Deleting or editing contacts
As our social and professional relationships change, the People app automati­
cally takes care of the paperwork. When somebody unfriends you on Facebook, 
they simply drift off your People app without notice. Similarly, if you stop fol­
lowing somebody on Twitter, the People app trims them off your list.
But if you need to edit or delete a contact you’ve added manually, either on 
your Surface or on your Google or Microsoft accounts, it’s fairly easy to do by 
following these steps:
	
1.	Tap the People tile on the Start screen.
	
	 The People app appears, as shown earlier in Figure 9-6.
	
2.	Tap the contact that needs changing.
	
	 Tap the first letter of their name, if necessary, to jump to your contacts 
beginning with that letter. When you tap the contact’s profile photo, her 
contact page appears full-screen.
	
3.	Slide your finger up slightly from the screen’s bottom edge to fetch 
the App bar.
	
	 The App bar appears as an icon-filled strip along the screen’s bottom.
	
4.	To delete a contact, tap the Delete button. To update a contact’s infor­
mation, tap the Edit button and make your changes. Then tap the Save 
button to save your changes.
	
	
	 The Delete icon appears only for Contacts added to Live or Outlook 
accounts. Don’t see a Delete icon? Then you need to drop by the social 
network that added the person, and delete her from there. The People 
app will update shortly afterward, wiping that person off your list.
	
	
	 Tapping the Edit button (shown in the margin) returns you to the screen 
shown earlier in Figure 9-7. There, you can update or add information. 
Finished? Tap the Save button to save your changes.
	
You can send e-mail from within the People app by tapping a person’s name. 
When her contact information appears, tap the Send E-Mail button. The Mail 
app appears, bearing a pre-addressed New Message window, ready for you to 
type your message and tap Send. (This trick works only if you have that con­
tact’s e-mail address.)
If the People app imported contacts from your Facebook or Twitter accounts, 
you can’t delete any of their imported contact information. But you can add 
information to their contacts page, a handy trick for adding personal details 
that your friend hasn’t posted on Facebook. Details you add don’t go to 
Facebook, though. They remain on your Surface, as well as on the contact list 
that syncs with your Microsoft account.

Managing Appointments in Calendar
If you manage your appointments through Outlook.com, you’re in luck: The 
Windows 8.1 Calendar app harvests that information automatically, just as 
it does with the People app. The Calendar app also picks up any birthdays it 
finds on Facebook.
Then it neatly packages your past, present, and future activity into the 
Calendar app, shown in Figure 9-8. (The app also cycles through your latest 
appointments on its Start screen tile.)
Figure 9-8: 
Shown here 
in Week 
view, the 
Calendar 
app stocks 
itself 
with your 
appoint-
ments, both 
those you 
entered 
yourself 
and those 
from your 
online social 
networks.
Don’t keep your appointments online? Then you need to add them by hand. 
And even if your appointments are online, you occasionally need to edit old 
entries, add new ones, or delete ones that conflict with new engagements. 
This section explains how to keep your appointments up to date.
To add an appointment to your Calendar app, follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap the Calendar tile on the Start screen.
	
	 The Calendar appears, as shown earlier in Figure 9-8.
	
	
2.	 Open the Apps bar and tap the New icon.
	
	 Slide your finger up from the screen’s bottom edge to reveal the App bar 
and its icons, including the New icon for creating new appointments.

	 Shown in Figure 9-9, most of the choices are pretty easy to figure out: 
Enter the date, time, duration, location, and a message — notes about 
what to bring to the potluck.
	
	 The Calendar app sends your appointment to your online calendar, as 
well, if you have one. To see your options, tap the downward-pointing 
arrow next to Calendar in the top right. A menu appears, letting you 
choose which online calendar should receive the appointment.
	
	 Unfortunately, you won’t see online calendars from Google or Apple; 
you’re stuck with Microsoft’s Live and Outlook.com calendars, as well as 
calendars on Exchange, a system used by some businesses.
	
	
	 Changed your mind about an appointment? Tap the back arrow in the 
screen’s top-left corner and then choose Discard Changes from the drop-
down menu.

✓	To edit an appointment, open it with a tap on its entry in the Calendar 
app. Make your changes and then save your edits with a tap on the Save 
icon.
	
✓	When browsing the Calendar app, flip through the appointments by 
flipping your finger across the calendar as if you were paging through a

Talking with Friends through Skype
Skype began life in 2003 as a way for people to make free phone calls over the 
Internet, talking from one PC to another. Today, Skype lets you do more than 
talk: You can send instant messages and make free video calls — talking face 
to face — from one computer screen to another.
Of course, the computers need to have an attached video camera, micro­
phone, and speaker before their owners can see and hear each other. 
Conveniently, your Surface includes all three, making it perfect for chatting 
or video-chatting through Skype. Skype comes pre-installed on every Surface 
model, including the original Surface RT and Surface Pro when they’re 
upgraded to Windows 8.1.
Most laptops today include video cameras, microphones, and speakers, and 
Skype is available as a free download at www.skype.com. Skype runs just 
as well on iPads and other tablets, as well as phones from Apple, Android, 
Blackberry and Windows. It also requires an Internet connection.
This section describes how to set up Skype the first time, as well as how to 
use it to send messages to friends, call other friends on their computers and 
landlines, and, if you’re feeling presentable, hold a video chat.
	
When owners of the original Surface and Surface Pro models upgrade to 
Windows 8.1, Skype appears, replacing the old Messenger app.

Setting up Skype for 
the first time
To run Skype for the first time on your Surface, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Start screen and tap the Skype tile or icon.
	
	
	 Don’t see the Skype tile on your Start screen? Then slide your finger 
upward from the screen’s middle to reveal the All Apps area. There, the 
Skype icon appears listed alphabetically, ready to launch with a tap of 
your finger.
	
2.	If asked, tap the Allow button to give Skype permission to use your 
webcam and microphone.
	
	 Apps always ask permission the first time they need to use your Surface’s 
webcam, microphone, or location data. After you grant permission, the 
apps stop bothering you.
	
	 If you download an app that shouldn’t need access to your webcam or 
microphone, click the Block button instead. You may have downloaded a 
rogue app that’s trying to do something malicious.
	
3.	Sign in with your Microsoft account if asked.
	
	 Skype, along with many other bundled apps, requires you to sign in with 
a Microsoft account.
	
4.	Tap the I’m New to Skype link, agree to the terms, and click Next. Or, 
if you already have a Skype account, tap the I Have a Skype Account 
link and move to Step 5.
	
5.	Skype appears, shown in Figure 9-10, listing Skype-equipped names 
from your People app, as well as an account for testing your equipment.
	
	 If you already have a Skype account, Microsoft gives you the chance 
to merge it with your Microsoft account, bringing your existing Skype 
address book along with it. If you’ve added friends previously through 
the Windows 8 Messaging app, they appear here, as well.
	
	 Even if you haven’t added any Skype contacts, you’ll see one listed: 
a test account named Echo \ Sound Test Service. Take note of the 
green dot next to its name. That green dot means that the account is 
online and available to be called. (When you add friends to Skype, the 
same green dot will appear next to the names of friends when they’re 
online.)

6.	Test your settings by tapping the Echo \ Sound Test Service account.
	
	 When you tap the Echo \ Sound Test Service account, the Skype Test 
screen appears, and a voice asks you to leave a message at the beep. 
Leave a test message in your normal speaking voice. After a moment, you 
hear another beep, followed by your recorded voice playing back to you.
	
	 If you hear yourself clearly when your voice plays back, everything 
is fine. If you can’t, something is wrong. Try testing the settings, as 
described in the rest of this section.
	
	 To test your Surface’s Skype settings, fetch the Charms bar by sliding your 
finger in from the screen’s right edge. Tap the Charms bar’s Settings icon, and 
when the Settings Pane appears, tap Options. When the screen in Figure 9-11 
appears, make sure these settings are correct:
	
✓	In the Audio section, choose Use Default Device from the Microphone 
drop-down menu. As you speak, watch the little bars next to the option 
rise and fall according to your voice level.
	
✓	Also in the Audio section, choose Use Default Device from the Speakers 
drop-down menu. To test the speakers, tap the little blue Play icon. 
You should hear a tone. If you don’t hear a tone, try turning up your 
Surface’s speakers using the Volume toggle on its upper-left corner. 
(I show you where to find the Volume toggle in Chapter 2.)
	
✓	In the Video section, make sure you can see your face in the test window. 
If you don’t see it, tap the Camera drop-down menu and select the front-
facing camera.
	
✓	If you still have trouble seeing or hearing yourself with Skype’s test 
account, visit the Skype support site at www.skype.com.

What is Skype WiFi?
No doubt about it, Microsoft creates confusion 
with its product names. When one of its prod­
ucts takes off, Microsoft stamps that product’s 
name on its other, less-successful, products. 
For example, Microsoft’s Outlook, the e-mail 
program in its Office suite, became a huge suc­
cess. So, Microsoft created Outlook.com, an 
online e-mail service that has nothing to do with 
the original Outlook program.
Microsoft’s Xbox turned into a popular video 
game console. So, Microsoft renamed its old-
and-struggling online music and movie stores 
with the new terms Xbox Music and Xbox Video.
Similarly, many people know Skype as a way to 
make computerized phone calls. So, Microsoft 
created Skype WiFi, a product that has nothing 
to do with Skype.
Instead, Skype WiFi is a payment system. When 
you pay up-front for Skype time, Microsoft lets you 
use that credit to pay for some third-party WiFi 
hotspots. However, not all Wi-Fi hotspots accept 
Skype WiFi payments, and the list of those that do 
constantly changes. Microsoft offers an online 
map at http://wifi.skype.com/maps.
If you ever try to log on to a Wi-Fi hotspot and 
see the words Pay with Skype WiFi, that simply 
means you can take some of the up-front money 
you’ve paid for Skype and hand it to the com­
pany running that particular Wi-Fi hotspot. 
There’s one perk: Paying with Skype WiFi cred­
its means you only pay for the minutes you use 
rather than being billed at longer durations.
Other than that, the two Skype products have 
nothing in common.

Part II: Connections 
Adding a friend to Skype
If you’re opening Skype for the first time, you see only one contact: the test­
ing robot you encountered in the previous section. And, unfortunately, adding 
friends to Skype is one of its weak links: The Skype program currently can’t 
import your Facebook or Messenger contacts. So, if you have a lot of messaging 
contacts and a Surface Pro or Surface Pro 2, try this workaround: Install Skype’s 
desktop program from www.skype.com. More powerful than the Skype app, 
the Skype desktop program can import those contacts. And when it does, the 
Skype desktop program stuffs those contacts into the Skype app, as well.
Because adding contacts to the Skype app is awkward work, you have to 
jump through these hoops to add your friends.
Note: Before trying to add a friend to Skype, make sure she has a Skype 
account, and ask for the name she uses on Skype. That makes it easier to find 
her in Skype’s directory and add her to the program.
	
1.	Open the Start screen and tap the Skype tile or icon.
	
	
	 Don’t see the Skype tile on your Start screen? Then slide your finger 
upward from the screen’s middle to reveal the All Apps area. There, the 
Skype icon appears listed alphabetically, ready to launch with a tap of 
your finger.
	
2.	In Skype, open the App bar and summon Skype’s directory by tapping 
the Add Contact icon.
	
	 Slide your finger down from the screen’s top edge to fetch the App bar, 
and tap the Add Contact icon.
	
3.	Search for your contact by her Skype name, real name, or e-mail 
address and then tap the Search icon.
	
	 If you don’t find any matches, tap the Directory button to search Skype’s 
global directory of Skype accounts.
	
4.	When the list of matching people appears, tap the name of the person 
you want to add.
	
	 The person’s messaging window opens.
	
5.	Tap the Add to Contacts button, write a brief message, and tap the 
Send button.
	
	 Your brief introductory message lets your friend know that you’re not a 
random creep indulging in random creepiness.
Then, you wait patiently until your friends approve your requests to be 
added to your Skype contacts. When they approve, they appear in your 
Skype’s opening page with an icon letting you know whether they’re online 
and available to accept voice or video chats.

 Chapter 9: Reaching Out with Mail, People, Calendar, and Skype
	
Managing your contacts takes a little work, helped through these tips:
	
✓	If you open Skype to find a cherished friend sending you a contact request, 
tap the Accept button. If they’re no longer a friend — or they’re a random 
creep (yes, it happens) — tap the Decline button.
	
✓	If Skype’s directory doesn’t find your friends, e-mail them to ask for their 
“Skype Name.” That makes them easier to find in the directory. Or, have 
them send you a contact request; accepting it places you both on each 
other’s Skype lists.
	
	
✓	Each friend you add to Skype appears on the opening screen, ready to 
be called with a tap of his name. If your list of contacts grows unwieldy, 
add your favorite friends as, um, Favorites: Tap a favorite friend’s name, 
open the App bar by sliding your finger up from the screen’s bottom, 
and tap the Favorite icon. (Repeat the process to remove them should 
they fall from favored status.)
	
	
✓	If somebody falls to even lower-than-favored status, remove her completely: 
Open the Skype App bar and tap the Remove icon. When removed, the 
newly humbled person must repeat the same Request and Accept steps 
that originally placed her on your Skype list.
Calling a friend
The Skype app lets you talk with friends for free, provided you’re communi­
cating entirely through the Internet. That lets you communicate three ways: 
sending text messages, chatting by voice, or videochatting.
But no matter how you want to yak it up, talking to a friend through the 
Skype app starts when you follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap the name of the person you want to reach.
	
	 Open the Skype app, and you see your list of contacts added in the 
previous section. Contacts with a green dot next to their names are 
online and accepting calls. Tap the person’s name, and his Conversation 
window appears.
	
2.	Choose how you’d like to contact the person.
	
	 Skype offers three ways, each designated by a different icon.
 
• Message: To send the person a message, just start typing it in the 
Message box along the screen’s bottom. If the recipient receives the 
message and responds, their response appears in the Conversation 
window. A simple “Are you there?” message often works best if 
you’re not sure a friend is available.
www.it-ebooks.info

202
Part II: Connections 
 
• Video chat: Tap the Video Chat icon to switch to a video stream, 
where you can see each other as you speak.
 
• Voice call: Tap the Call Now icon to begin talking, rather than 
typing, to each other.
	
3.	Wait for the person to respond.
	
	 If the person responds, Skype either displays his responding message, 
plays his voice, or fills the screen with his smiling face. If the person 
doesn’t respond, nothing happens. But take heart that your message will 
remain in his Skype Recent column, so he can return your call with a tap 
of your name.
To end a call, first say goodbye, either by typing it out in a chat session or 
saying the words when talking or video conferencing. Then slide your finger 
down from the screen’s top edge and tap Skype’s Home button. Skype returns 
to its opening screen, ready for you to make a new call or to accept an incom­
ing call or message. (Alternatively, you can close the app by sliding your 
finger all the way down the screen, from top to bottom.)
Calling a landline
The Skype app lets you make free voice calls from your Surface to another 
Surface, PC, or almost any other type of computer gadget. But if you want 
to call a real telephone number — a landline or cell phone — you need to 
Receiving a Skype call
Receiving a Skype call is easier than making 
one because you don’t need to do any of the 
work. When somebody contacts you through 
Skype, a tile appears in the top-right corner of 
your currently viewed screen.
Not using your Surface at the time? You’ll see 
a notification appear as soon as you sign in to 
your Surface. And, when you open Skype, you’ll 
also see a list of anybody who tried to contact 
you while you were away.
If somebody sends you a message through 
Skype, the tile displays the message. Tap it to 
respond; Skype automatically appears for you 
to begin communicating. If the tile disappears 
before you can tap it, open Skype; you see the 
message waiting in the screen’s left column. 
Tap the message to reciprocate, this time send­
ing them a message.
If somebody sends you a voice or video call 
request, a tile also appears in your screen’s 
top-right corner. This time, though, the tile 
offers three choices: Tap the tile’s Video icon 
to start a video chat; tap the Voice icon to start 
a voice conversation; or, if it’s an inopportune 
time, tap the Decline icon. If you Decline, 
the request will be waiting for you in the left 
column the next time you open the Skype app.

pay with real money. That’s where Skype Credits come in. You buy them in 
advance and then use them on a per-minute basis as you talk to somebody 
on their landline.
	
The first time you try to dial a real phone number, Microsoft offers you a 
chance to buy Skype Credits. But before paying up, take advantage of the free 
one-year Skype subscription that came with your Surface 2 or Surface Pro 2. 
(I describe how to do that in Chapter 3.)
To dial a real phone number with Skype, follow these steps:
	
1.	Start Skype with a tap on its Start screen tile.
	
	
2.	Tap the New Call icon in the screen’s upper-left corner; when the 
numeric keypad appears, tap in the number you want to call.
	
	 If you’re calling somebody in a country other than your own, first 
choose that country from the drop-down list above the keypad.
After you dial the number, the experience is much like a “real” phone. You 
hear the sound of the other phone ringing, and then you hear either the 
happy voice of your friend or the robotic voice of her answering machine.

E

very Surface tablet includes two cameras: one on its front side and the 
other on its back. However, your Surface doesn’t make for a very satisfy­
ing camera. There’s no viewfinder, and screen reflections make it hard to aim 
at your subject. Forget about taking flash photos or zooming in. And face it, 
everybody looks pretty dorky when taking a picture with a tablet. Your ever-
present smartphone probably takes better-quality photos.
No, your Surface shines when displaying photos and videos, and this chapter 
walks you through doing both. (I describe how to use your Surface’s built-in 
cameras for holding video chats with friends in Skype in Chapter 9.)

how in Chapter 6.
Snapping Photos or Videos
Your Surface displays photos much better than it can capture them. Most 
Surface models include a miserly 1.2-megapixel cameras. Only the Surface 2 
ups the game slightly to a 5-megapixel rear camera. By comparison, the 
Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone offers a whopping 13-megapixel rear camera.

But if you’re struck with a Kodak moment and your Surface is the only 
camera you have handy, follow these steps to snap a quick photo or movie:
	
	
1.	 From the Start menu, tap the Camera app’s tile.
	
	 The Camera app appears, shown in Figure 10-1, immediately filling 
the screen with what it sees before its lens. (Your Surface remembers 
whether you last shot with the front or rear camera, and it uses that 
camera accordingly.)
	
	 Note how a light begins glowing next to the lens currently in use, letting 
you and your subject know what’s being filmed.
	
	 Folding back your Surface’s Touch or Type Cover blocks the bottom 
half of the rear camera’s lens. Remove the keyboard cover before 
­snapping a photo.
	
2.	Change the camera’s controls, if desired.
	
	 The Camera app always displays the first three controls in the following 
list; you see the other four only when you open the App bar by sliding 
your finger up from the screen’s bottom edge:
 
• Take video: Tap this to begin shooting video rather than snapping 
a still photo.
	
 
• Take photo: Tap this to snap a photo. (Or, if you’re already in 
Photo mode rather than Video mode, you can take a photo by 
­tapping anywhere on the screen.)

3.	To snap a photo or begin shooting a movie, touch the screen.
	
	 When you’re shooting a photo, the Camera app emits a mechanical shut­
ter click sound and then quickly saves the snapshot. Your newly saved 
snapshot quickly scoots out of sight to the screen’s left edge, letting you 
snap another photo.
	
	
	 When you’re shooting videos, a timer appears in the screen’s lower-left 
corner to show your movie’s current length. To stop shooting the movie, 
tap the Stop Video icon along the screen’s right edge.
Your photos and videos both live in your Picture library’s Camera Roll folder, 
where they can be viewed with the Photos app, described in the next two 
sections.
	
These tips help you explore the Camera app for the first time:
	
✓	To view your newly shot photo or movie, slide your finger across the 
screen from left to right to drag your last-shot photo (or the first frame 
of your movie) back into view. To return to shooting, slide your finger in 
the other direction, and the live view reappears.
	
✓	Need to take a picture in a hurry? Turn on your Surface, and at the Lock 
screen, slide your finger downward on the screen rather than upward. If 
you’re already signed in, the Camera app quickly appears, letting you snap 
your photo without stopping to unlock the screen and type your password.
	
✓	When shooting in Panorama mode, pretend your Surface is mounted on 
a tripod. As you hold it, keep it level and then slowly rotate and tilt it, 
moving so it eventually points in all directions. If the Camera app says 
you’ve moved too far or too fast, slow down, and point the Surface back 
to the previous location.

Why are my Surface’s photos stored on OneDrive?
In the past, your photos always stayed inside 
your camera until you removed them. For many 
years, that same logic held true when you took 
pictures with your cell phone or even with your 
computer’s webcam.
Now, your Surface and some smartphones 
change that basic rule of photography. Unless 
you chose otherwise when first setting up your 
user account on your Surface, the photos you 
snap on your Surface are automatically copied 
to OneDrive. This copying affects you several 
ways:
	✓	The process takes place in the background 
so transparently that you probably won’t 
notice.
	✓	If your Surface isn’t connected to the 
Internet when you snap a photo, your 
Surface uploads the photo the next time 
you connect with the Internet.
	✓	Your Surface sends low-resolution photos 
to OneDrive. That means they’re fine for 
viewing onscreen, but not good enough to 
make the best prints.
	✓	Your original, full-quality photos remain on 
your Surface, where you can view them 
and show them to friends, even without 
an Internet connection. (If you want to 
print them, print your Surface’s photos 
rather their lower-resolution versions on 
OneDrive.)
	✓	You can view or share your photos on 
OneDrive from any Internet-connected 
device, even when your Surface is nowhere 
in sight. Because they’re low-resolution, 
they’re also easy to download and view 
quickly on smartphones.
	✓	You can send your friends a link to your 
OneDrive photos, making it easy for them 
to view them.
	✓	Keeping copies on OneDrive is generally a 
good thing. It gives you an automatic backup 
in case you lose the originals. Also, your 
OneDrive photos can be viewed from any of 
your gadgets, including your phone, which 
makes your photos easier to show to friends.
If you want to keep your photos away from 
OneDrive, follow these steps:
	 1.	 From any screen, fetch the Charms bar by 
sliding your finger in from the screen’s 
right edge. Then tap the Settings icon.
	 2.	 Tap the PC Settings link at the bottom of the 
Settings pane.
	 3.	 When the PC Settings screen appears, tap 
the OneDrive link from the right column.
	 4.	 When the OneDrive settings screen appears, 
tap the Camera Roll link in the left column.
	 5.	 Tap the Don’t Upload Photos button to keep 
your photos from appearing on OneDrive. 
Your changes take place immediately.
An adjacent button lets you choose to Upload 
Photos at Best Quality, which keeps a copy of 
your original photos both on your Surface and 
OneDrive. Choose this option only if you plan 
to make prints from your OneDrive photos. 
Otherwise, stick with the low-resolution photos 
so you can show them off on your phone with­
out worrying about using up your data plan.
To send a copy of your videos to OneDrive, 
as well, tap the adjacent toggle named 
Automatically Upload Videos to OneDrive.

Viewing Photos
As soon as you add a few photos to your Surface, the Photos app begins 
displaying them even without being told. That’s because the Photos tile on 
the Start screen is a live tile: When you open the Start screen, the Photos tile 
automatically cycles through your photos in a mini-slideshow.
Note: Desktop fans can view their photos by opening the Start screen’s 
Desktop app, opening File Manager, tapping This PC in File Manager’s left 
pane, and tapping the Pictures folder.
To view your photos as more than thumbnail-sized previews, open the 
Photos app with a tap of its Start screen tile, and the results appear, as shown 
in Figure 10-2.
When first opened, the Photos app displays your Surface’s folders along the 
left edge, and your photos along the right.
Figure 10-2: 
The Photos 
app shows 
photos 
stored 
on your 
Surface, as 
well as on 
OneDrive, 
Microsoft’s

age service.

Part III: Play 
The Photos app shows a tile for each folder, and each folder usually shows 
a preview of a photo stored inside. Oddly enough, the folder’s name helps 
explain the photos’ source:
	
✓	Date: Folders named after a particular date usually contain photos 
imported from a point-and-shoot camera on that particular day. 
(I describe how to copy photos from your camera into your Surface in 
Chapter 6.)
	
✓	Camera Roll: Photos and videos taken with your Surface’s built-in 
cameras always end up in the Camera Roll folder. A photo named 
WIN_2014122_215505 means it was taken in 2014 on January 22 at 
9:55 pm and 5 seconds.
	
✓	Screenshots: Look in here to see screenshots, which are images you’ve 
copied from your Surface’s screen. (To take a screenshot, press the 
Volume Down toggle switch while pressing the Windows key below your 
Surface’s screen.)
	
✓	Scans: If you connect a scanner to your Surface, the Scanner app stores 
your scans in this folder.
Follow these steps to view the photos, scans, or screenshots stored in your 
Surface’s Pictures folder or OneDrive:
	
1.	Open the Photos app.
	
	
	 If the Photos app doesn’t resemble the icon in the margin, then its tile is 
probably displaying one of your photos. When opened, the Photos app 
shows folders and photos stored in your Surface’s Pictures folder.
	
2.	Navigate to the folder you’d like to open.
	
	 Tap a folder, and it opens to display its contents.
	
	
	 To back out of any folder, tap the backward-pointing arrow in the 
­upper-left corner. Keep tapping the arrow, and you’ll eventually return 
to the Photos app opening menu, shown earlier in Figure 10-2.
	
	 To browse photos stored on your OneDrive account, tap the words 
Pictures Library in the screen’s upper-left corner, and choose OneDrive 
from the drop-down menu. (To return to the Pictures library, reverse 
the steps: Tap the word OneDrive, but choose Pictures Library from the 
drop-down menu.)
	
3.	Tap a photo to view it full screen.
	
	 When you tap a photo, it fills the screen. Pinch or stretch the photo 
between your fingers to zoom in or out. To see its menus, shown in 
Figure 10-3, slide your finger up from the screen’s bottom edge.
	
	
	 To back out of a photo, tap it; then tap the Back arrow icon that appears 
in its upper-right corner.

The Photos 
app lets 
you zoom in

The Photos app’s App bar displays different buttons depending on what 
you’re viewing. For example, the App bar offers these buttons when you’re 
viewing a single fullscreen photo or movie:
	
	
✓	Delete: Delete your currently viewed photo or movie and then view the 
next one.
	
	
✓	Open With: Tap this, and a pop-up menu lets you choose which program 
should open the photo for viewing or editing. It’s a handy way to tell a 
desktop program to open your photo, for example.
	
	
✓	Set As: Tap this to fetch a pop-up menu; there, you can turn your cur­
rently viewed photo into the background for your Surface’s Lock screen 
or a current background for the Photos app’s tile.
	
	
✓	Slide Show: A handy way to show off photos, tapping this button 
launches a slideshow of every photo or movie in the currently viewed 
folder. To stop the show, tap anywhere on the screen.
	
	
✓	Rotate: This rotates the picture but only clockwise (to the right). So, tap 
it twice to correct an upside-down photo. Tap it three times to rotate the 
photo to the left.
	
	
✓	Crop: Tap this when viewing a photo, and a rectangle overlays itself 
across your photo. Drag the entire rectangle or just its corners to frame 
a different portion of the photo. Tap the Apply button to crop, and the 
app saves your crop as a new picture with a different name, preserving 
the original photo.

	When you tap the Crop button, an optional Aspect Ratio button appears. 
Tap it to see a pop-up menu with options for cropping your photo to 
match common print sizes such as 4x3, 5x7, 8x10, square, and others. 
(The menu’s Lock Screen option lets you crop the best portion of your 
photo to fit perfectly on your Surface’s Lock screen.)
	
	
✓	Edit: Tap this to enter Editing mode, where you can change the photo’s 
lighting, color, or add special effects. (For quick results, tap the AutoFix 
button and then tweak the edits at that point.)
	
	
✓	Trim: Tap this when viewing a movie, and a circle appears at each end of 
the video’s timeline, shown along the screen’s bottom. Drag the circles 
along the timeline to mark the video’s new starting and stopping points. 
Then tap OK to save your newly trimmed video.
When you first open or return to the Photos app, the App bar changes yet 
again to offer these helpful buttons:	
	
✓	Select All: This selects all of the currently shown folders and photos for 
later action, including Delete, Share, or Print. (If tapped by mistake, tap the 
App bar’s Clear Selection button to return the selected items to normal.)
	
	
✓	New Folder: Tap this to create a new folder, handy for categorizing 
photos according to subject.
	
	
✓	Import: Tap the Import button to import photos from an attached 
camera or your memory card, as I describe in Chapter 6.
The Photos app shows only photos stored on your Surface or OneDrive. It’s 
not smart enough to show photos stored on network locations. To see those, 
open the Desktop app and open File Explorer, covered in Chapter 12. There, 
you can navigate to any location available to your Surface. Tap a photo, and 
the Photos app reappears, ready to show off the photos in that location.
Sharing or Printing Photos
Photos and videos aren’t much fun when they sit alone on your Surface. No, 
your cat photos are more fun when your friends can see your beloved feline, as 
well. The Photos app lets you share or print photos and videos by following 
these steps:
	
1.	Open the folder containing your photos or videos and then select the 
videos or photos you want to share or print.
	
	 To select individual photos, videos, and folders, slide your finger down­
ward on their tiles. As you select them with a short downward swipe, 
the tiles sprout check marks in their upper-right corners.
	
	
	 Or, to select all the folders and photos currently displayed in the Photos 
app, tap the Select All icon from the App bar.

215
 Chapter 10: Photos and Movies
	
2.	Visit the Charms bar and choose Share or Devices.
	
	 Swipe your finger inward from the screen’s right edge to fetch the 
Charms bar and then tap either Share (for sharing with friends) or 
Devices (for printing your images).
	
 
• Share: The Share pane opens, listing every app able to share your 
photo or video. A tap of the Mail app, for example, opens the Mail 
pane, where you enter the recipient’s e-mail address and tap the 
Send button. (I cover mailing attached files in Chapter 9.) If your 
social network doesn’t yet have an app, visit the site through 
Internet Explorer to share the photo.
	
 
• Devices: When the Devices pane appears, tap Print to see your 
installed printers. Tap your printer’s name, and the Printer window 
appears, offering you a preview of the printed page. (I explain how 
to print, as well as how to connect a printer to your Surface, in 
Chapter 6.)
Watching Movies
More a shopping mall than an app, Microsoft designed the Video app to pull 
you into its two storefronts: The movies section entices you to buy or rent 
movies, and the television section adds the hook for TV shows, both past 
and present.
Be sure to use the Video app only when you’re logged in with a Microsoft 
account, and your wallet will always be available. You also need a strong 
Wi-Fi connection for downloading or streaming videos.
Watching your own movies
For some reason, the Video app doesn’t list 
movies you’ve shot with your Surface’s built-in 
Camera app. To play those movies in the Video 
app, slide your finger up from the Video app 
screen’s bottom edge to reveal the App bar. Tap 
the Open File icon and then use the File Picker, 
covered in Chapter 4, to navigate to the videos 
in your Pictures library’s Camera Roll folder.
The Surface works with videos encoded in 
WMV (Windows Media Video) or H.264/MP4 
movie formats. The Video app doesn’t support 
other video formats, like TV shows recorded by 
Windows Media Center or TiVo. If your movies 
are encoded in another format, you need a 
conversion program to copy them into MP4 
format.
Or, if you own a Surface Pro or Surface Pro 2, 
you can upgrade your Desktop app to Windows 
Media Center. It’s a $10 upgrade that lets you 
watch any show recorded with Windows 
Media Center; I explain how to upgrade in the 
sidebar in Chapter 12.

To open the Video app and browse its wares, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Start screen, tap the Video tile.
	
	 The Video app appears, shown in Figure 10-4. The Video app imme­
diately confuses things by changing its name to Xbox Video. That’s 
because the Video app lets you play videos to your Xbox game console, 
if you have one, so you can watch your movies on the big screen.
Figure 10-4: 
The Video 
app lets you 
watch your 
own videos, 
as well as 
rent or buy 
movies and 
TV shows.
	
2.	Browse to the type of video you want to watch.
	
	 The Video app sprawls horizontally across your screen. If offers four 
main sections, most of which hide beyond the screen’s left and right 
edges:
 
• Home: When first opened, Xbox Video shows this screen that lists 
currently popular shows and movies.
 
• Personal Videos: Scroll to the left of the opening Home screen to 
see the hidden area that shows any videos living in your Surface’s 
Videos library. (That area also contains videos you’ve purchased 
or downloaded from the Video app.)
 
• My TV/My Movies: Next to your Personal Videos section, the app lists 
TV shows or movies you’ve purchased previously from Xbox Video.
 
• Recommendations: If you’ve purchased or rented other movies, 
Xbox Video lists similar movies here.

• New Movies/Featured Movies: Head here for the latest releases so 
you can catch up on movies you’ve missed on the big screen.
 
• New TV Shows/Featured TV Shows: Similar to the previous cat­
egory, this lets you watch the TV shows everybody was talking 
about at the water cooler last week.
	
3.	Tap a video’s tile to see more about it.
	
	As you browse the categories, tap any tile to browse trailers and to buy 
or rent movies and TV shows. (Some shows offer a free episode, usually 
a season opener.)
	
	 Other buttons let you buy the video, see more about it, watch its trailer, 
or in the case of TV shows, buy a discounted season package or indi­
vidual episodes.
	
	 Most shows come in both high-definition video (more expensive) and 
standard-definition video (usually discounted by about 30 percent).
	
4.	Watch a video.
	
	 Tap a movie or TV show tile from the storefronts to rent, buy, or down­
load the video to your My Videos section. The app charges the credit card 
associated with your Microsoft account, or prompts you to set one up.
	
	 As you watch a video, slide your finger up from the screen’s bottom to 
expose buttons for pausing, playing, and skipping forward/backward. 
The Play To button lets you play the video through your Xbox game con­
sole if you have one.
	
Before diving into the Video app with your credit card, keep these tips 
in mind:
	
✓	When starting with the Video app, view free things at first to familiarize 
yourself with the app’s mechanics. The Video app often offers free TV 
pilots, free movie trailers, and behind-the-scenes promo videos.
	
✓	Can’t find a particular item? Tap the Search box in the app’s upper-
right corner, type a keyword, and press Enter. The Video app lists all 
matching videos.
	
✓	Rental items and some specials are time-dated, meaning they’ll disap­
pear from your Videos library after a certain date. Read the fine print so 
you know exactly what you’re buying and how long you have to watch it.
	
✓	If you’ll be traveling, look for items with a Download option. After these 
items are downloaded, you can watch them when you’re out of range of 
a Wi-Fi connection. (Again, read the fine print because even some down­
loaded videos will expire after a certain time.)

✓	Before you can buy anything, the Video app requires you to type your 
Microsoft account password. That’s a handy safeguard against acci­
dentally brushing against a Buy button and downloading a season of 
Keeping Up with the Kardashians.
	
✓	You’re not restricted to your Surface’s Video app for movies. Netflix 
offers a free app for watching streaming movies, and you can watch 
Amazon’s instant videos, as well. (Amazon hasn’t released an instant 
video app at the time of this writing, but you can still watch Amazon’s 
videos through your web browser.)

Listening to Music
In This Chapter
▶	Adding your own music to your Surface
▶	Playing music through the Music app
▶	Playing free music through the Music app’s Radio
▶	Signing up for Xbox Music Pass
▶	Exploring new music
S

ome people spend more time organizing their music than listening to it. 
They store each album in its own folder and meticulously rename each 
song’s title to include the album name and recording year.
Your Surface, however, isn’t built for micromanaging your songs. No, like any 
tablet, your Surface works best for playing music, and the Music app tries 
to simplify that task by letting you listen to music in any of three ways: You 
can play music that’s already on your Surface, listen to music on Microsoft’s 
streaming music service, and buy new songs and albums through Microsoft’s 
music store.
This chapter covers all three ways to move music from your Surface into 
your ears.
Understanding the Music App
When you first open the Music app, shown in Figure 11-1, the opening 
screen’s left side highlights the app’s three main features:
	
✓	Collection: Tap here to view and play music already stored on your 
Surface.
	
✓	Radio: Tap this to listen to music from Microsoft’s free or paid streaming 
music services.
	
✓	Explore: Tap Explore to browse the bins at Microsoft’s online shop for 
buying songs or albums.

Part III: Play 
	 	
The Music app’s opening screen will change when you begin listening to 
music, but the column along the app’s right edge always provides access to 
those three core areas.
The rest of this chapter explains how to get the most out of each category.
	
	 If the Music app’s right column shrinks, tap the three green lines near its top, 
shown earlier in Figure 11-1. That icon serves as a toggle to open or collapse 
the column, leaving more space to view your music.

 Chapter 11: Listening to Music
Listing to Your Own Music
The Music app would make a poor student because it rarely finishes a task to 
completion. For example, when first loaded, the app searches your Surface’s 
Music folder to add your music. However, it doesn’t bother to search any 
memory cards or drives attached to your Surface.
Even when told to play your own music, the app lapses into a salesman role, 
trying to convince you to buy songs or subscribe to Microsoft’s pay services.
The following sections explain how to quiet the Music app’s built-in salesman 
and instead concentrate on playing music already on your Surface.
Adding your own music to the Music app
To start listening to your own music, tap the Collection button from the 
Music app’s right edge, shown earlier in Figure 11-1. The Music app takes a 
quick dive into the Music library on your Surface, and displays the results, 
shown in Figure 11-2.
Don’t mess with my metadata
Music players, including the Music app, rarely 
look at your songs’ filenames. Instead, players 
read each file’s metadata — information stored 
inside the files that contains the name of the 
song, artist, album, recording date, genre, and 
other information.
When the Music app begins adding your music, 
the app visits the Internet to identify your song 
and examine its metadata. The app fills in empty 
spots, corrects misspellings, adds cover art, 
and performs other mostly hidden touches.
Most people enjoy the Music app’s background 
work. Others, particularly those who spend a 
lot of time manually editing their songs’ meta­
data, view it as meddling. In fact, sometimes the 
Music app makes mistakes.
If you don’t want the Music app to mess with 
your songs’ metadata, tell it to stop by following 
these steps before you import your music:
	 1.	 Open the Music app, fetch the Charms bar, 
tap the Settings icon, and tap Preferences 
from the Settings pane.
	 2.	 In the Preferences pane’s Media Info sec­
tion, tap the toggle called Automatically 
Retrieve and Update Album Art and 
Metadata.
That keeps Microsoft from comparing your 
music to its vast database and changing your 
songs’ metadata to match its own.
The Music app doesn’t provide any way to edit 
metadata, but you can edit it from the Desktop 
app’s File Explorer: Right-click the file you want 
to edit, choose Properties from the pop-up 
menu, and click the Details tab.

Part III: Play 
Figure 11-2: 
Unless 
told other-
wise, the 
Music app 
searches 
only your 
Surface’s 
Music 
library for 
your music.
If you store all of your music in your Surface’s Music library, you’re fine: All of 
your music will appear in your Collection folder.
Chances are good, though, that you may keep your music in other loca­
tions. For example, to conserve your Surface’s meager storage space, you 
may store music on a memory card tucked into your Surface’s memory card 
slot. (I explain how to expand your Surface’s storage with memory cards in 
Chapter 6.)
You may also store music in other places, such as OneDrive, a flash drive, or 
perhaps on a home network.
The Music app won’t find any of that music until you tell it exactly where to 
look by following these steps:
	
1.	Open the Music app and tell it where to look for your music files.
	
	 If the opening screen says, “If you’re not seeing your music, tap to 
change where we look,” then tap that message. The screen shown in 
Figure 11-3 appears.
	
	
	 If the Music app’s opening screen doesn’t offer to find your music, add 
your songs this way: Open the Charms bar by sliding your finger in from 
the screen’s right edge. Then tap the Settings icon, tap Preferences from 
the Settings Pane, and tap the Preferences link called Choose Where We 
Look for Music on This PC.
	
	 No matter which of the two routes you take, the Music app screen looks 
like Figure 11-3, where it lists the folders currently monitored by the 
Music app.

	 The File Picker lists your currently viewed storage area in the screen’s 
top-left corner; tap that area to see a drop-down menu listing all of your 
Surface’s storage areas, as shown in Figure 11-4.
	
	 For example, to add a folder called Music on OneDrive, tap the currently 
listed storage area listed in the File Picker’s upper-left corner. When 
the drop-down menu appears, as shown earlier in Figure 11-4, choose 
OneDrive. When the File Picker lists your folders on OneDrive, tap 
the Music tile. Then tap the Add This Folder to Music button from the 
screen’s bottom-right corner.
	
	 Or, to add a Music folder on your Surface’s memory card, tap the cur­
rently listed storage area in the File Picker’s top-left corner and then 
choose This PC from the drop-down menu. Then tap the Secure Digital 
Storage Device (D:), which is Microsoft’s odd name for your memory 
card. Tap your memory card’s Music folder, then tap the Add This Folder 
to Music button.

✓	To remove a folder from the Music app’s catalog, follow the preceding 
Step 1. When Figure 11-3 appears (shown earlier), tap the X in the upper-
right corner of the folder you want to remove. (That doesn’t delete the 
folder; it just tells the Music app to ignore it.)

 Chapter 11: Listening to Music
	
✓	If you’re a Windows desktop person, take note that the Music app 
catalogs all the music stored in your Desktop app’s Music library. So, a 
simple way to add songs to the Music App is to place those folders in 
your Music library, a task I cover in Chapter 12.
	
✓	The Music app may display unexpectedly different artwork for your 
music. That’s because the app grabs the artwork from the Internet along 
with other bits of metadata. I explain more about the Music app’s reli­
ance on metadata in the sidebar, “Don’t mess with my metadata.”
Playing your music in the Music app
After you’ve stocked the Music app with your own music, as I describe in the 
previous section, the app plays it fairly predictably.
When looking at your collection, shown in Figure 11-5, you can choose to dis­
play your music by Albums, Artists, or Songs by tapping those three labeled 
buttons along the app’s top edge.
To move up or down the list of displayed music, slide your finger up or down 
the list. When you spot the album, artist, or song you want to hear, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Tap the album artist or song you want to hear.
	
	 The Music app works a little differently depending on what you’ve 
tapped:
 
• Album: The Music app displays a list of songs on the album.
 
• Artist: The app displays a list of albums you own from that artist, 
followed by a list of that artist’s albums and popular songs you can 
buy.
 
• Name: Every song in your collection appears, sorted by the 
order you choose from the drop-down list at the top, shown in 
Figure 11-5.
	
	
	 To back out of a list, tap the Back arrow in the screen’s upper-left corner.
	
2.	Tap the Play button to listen to your selected music. Control the 
music’s playback by tapping the buttons on the strip along the app’s 
bottom.
	
	 The Music app always shows familiar control buttons along the bottom 
edge. Shown earlier in Figure 11-5, they let you skip forward or back, 
stop, and play your currently selected song.

 Chapter 11: Listening to Music
	
	
	 If you continue to explore the Music app, your music continues to play 
in the background. The Music app displays different buttons on different 
screens. Here’s what happens when you tap any of these buttons:
 
• Back Arrow: Tap this to back out of your current screen and 
return to the previous one.
	
 
• Play: Play the currently viewed songs or album.
	
 
• Pin to Start: Pin a tile for this album to the Start screen for quick 
one-tap access.
	
 
• Add to playlist: A playlist is simply a list of currently playing 
songs. When you play an album, you’re creating a playlist of that 
album’s songs. Tap this icon to add a selected song or album to 
either the list of currently playing songs or a new playlist. Or, if you 
have an Xbox Music Pass, copy your music to the cloud by match­
ing it with a song from Microsoft’s song catalog, as described in the 
“Matching music” sidebar.
	
 
• Explore artist: When viewing an album, tap this to see more infor­
mation about the artist, including other popular albums.
	
 
• Start Radio: Shown next to an artist’s name when viewing by 
Artist, this begins playing a radio station with songs by that artist 
or similar to the artist’s style. (I cover the Music app’s Radio fea­
ture in the next section.)
	
 
• More: Found on crowded button lists, this launches a pop-up menu 
to show any buttons that didn’t fit in a neat row.
	
Your Surface’s Touch and Type Cover keyboards have dedicated music play­
back keys along the top row. There, you can toggle between Play and Pause, as 
well as toggle the Mute button/Volume bar.
The Music app works in a fairly straightforward way, but Microsoft constantly 
tosses in extra buttons, eager for you to buy new music or subscribe to its 
music services.
If you’re looking for a no-frills player that concentrates solely on managing 
your own music, drop by the Windows Store and try a few of the alternative 
music players. (I like Media Monkey.)
	
While working your way through the Music app, try these tips to discover 
some of the app’s less-obvious features:
	
✓	To make the Music app begin playing your entire library in Shuffle mode, 
tap the Shuffle icon next to the word Collection.
	
✓	To select a particular song or album from a list, hold your finger down 
on it and then slide your finger slightly to the left. Repeat with other 
items to select them, as well. Slide your finger in the reverse direction to 
deselect an item.

✓	To play music on a newly inserted flash drive, fetch the App bar by slid­
ing your finger up from the screen’s bottom edge. Then tap the Open File 
icon. The File Picker appears, letting you navigate to your flash drive 
and play its music.
	
✓	If you’re more accustomed to the Windows desktop, feel free to play 
your music from your desktop’s Music library. Double-tap any selected 
song or songs, and the Music app opens to play them.
	
✓	The Surface RT and Surface 2 don’t include the desktop’s Media Player. 
However, Media Player lives on in the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2, 
offering an alternative way to manage and play your music.
	
✓	The Music app plays only MP3 and WMA files, including WMA lossless. It 
won’t play other lossless formats such as .flac, .ogg, or .ape.
Listening to the Radio
I describe how to fill your Music app with music earlier in this chapter. But 
even an empty Surface can dish out just about any song you want to hear. 
Those songs come from an Xbox Music Pass, a service Microsoft entices you 
with when you open the Music app.
Matching music
As you peruse the Music app’s menus, you may 
spot an offer to “match music” or “create a 
cloud collection.” That odd phrasing boils down 
to these mechanics:
Matching means that you grant Microsoft per­
mission to compare the music on your Surface 
with the music in Microsoft’s own music cata­
log. For example, if you own Michael Jackson’s 
Thriller album, Microsoft will also find that 
album in its catalog.
Because you and Microsoft both own the 
album, Microsoft then lets you stream its cloud 
version to any Windows device with an Xbox 
Music app: your Surface, your Windows 8 or 
8.1 PC, your Xbox game console, and even your 
Windows Phone.
By matching your music with Microsoft’s col­
lection, you no longer have to keep copies of all 
your music on all of your gadgets. Instead, you 
play Microsoft’s cloud version of your matched 
tunes, streaming the songs to whichever device 
you want.
The catch? You need to buy an Xbox Music 
Pass, which I describe in this chapter’s 
“Listening to the Radio” section.
www.it-ebooks.info

229
 Chapter 11: Listening to Music
The Music app refers to the Xbox Music Pass as Radio because it’s a similar 
concept: Music you don’t own comes streaming into your Surface, just as if 
your Surface were a radio. It’s free for a limited time, supported by built-in 
ads. When your trial period expires, Microsoft limits your listening time to 
ten hours of ad-supported music per month unless you pay up. (I explain the 
details later in this section.)
If you have no interest in Microsoft’s Xbox Music Pass, stick with the previ­
ous section, where you can simply play your own tunes.
But if you’re curious as to Microsoft’s way of letting you listen to more than 
30 million songs for free, follow these steps to turn on the Radio and sample 
the Xbox Music Pass. (I explain the fine print at this section’s end.)
	
You need an Internet connection to hear the Music app’s Radio. When you’re 
out of range of a Wi-Fi connection, the music stops streaming.
	 	
1.	Load the Music app with a tap of its tile on the Start screen.
	
	 The Music app loads, shown earlier in Figure 11-5, showing its three 
categories along the left edge: Collection, Radio, and Explore.
	
2.	Tap the Radio category from the Music app’s left column and tap the 
Start a Station button.
	
	 A window appears, shown in Figure 11-6, prompting you to enter an 
artist’s name.
Figure 11-6:

artist’s 
name and 
press Enter

www.it-ebooks.info

230
Part III: Play 
	
3.	Type a musical artist’s name into the Enter Artist box and then press 
Enter.
	
	 When you type the artist’s name and press Enter, the Music app begins 
playing a song either by that artist or by an artist with a similar style.
	
	 To see the list of songs that the Radio will play, tap the Now Playing link 
from the app’s left column; the list usually contains about twelve songs.
	
	 The Music app’s usual playback controls work with the Radio, letting 
you pause or skip between tracks.
You’re now free to listen to millions of songs by thousands of artists simply 
by tapping the Radio category and typing the artist’s name.
	
	 You can also launch the Radio while browsing your own music collection by 
artist. Click the Radio button next to the artist’s name, and the Radio begins 
playing songs based on that artist — for free.
Now, a moment for the fine print:
	
✓	If you haven’t signed in with a Microsoft Account, the Radio feature 
eventually stops. At this point, you need to sign in with a Microsoft 
account to continue playing the Radio.
	
✓	When you listen to the Radio with a Microsoft account, Microsoft plays 
ads in between the songs. Sometimes you just hear a voiceover, at other 
times, the Music app plays a fullscreen video ad. And after six months, 
Microsoft limits your ad-supported-but-free streaming to ten hours each 
month, which is about 20 minutes a day.
	
✓	To see how much of your monthly streaming limit is left, fetch the 
Charms bar, tap Settings, and tap Preferences from the Settings pane.
	
✓	To bypass the ads and the ten-hour monthly limit, you must sign up for 
a free 30-day trial. After 30 days, Microsoft begins automatically charging 
$10 a month to your credit card.
	
✓	During that 30-day trial (and if you subscribe to the service), you can 
play the music on your Surface, a Windows Phone, a Windows 8 or 
8.1 PC, or an Xbox game console (provided you’re an Xbox Live Gold 
member, which costs extra). Those platforms all run Xbox Live Music, 
and you can play the songs through Xbox Live only by signing into the 
service.
	
✓	That 30-day free trial also lets you stream any of your own “matching” 
music you’ve stored on your Surface, Windows Phone, a Windows 8 or 
8.1 PC, or an Xbox game console. (I describe matching in the “Matching 
music” sidebar.)
www.it-ebooks.info

231
 Chapter 11: Listening to Music
	
✓	If your subscription lapses, you can no longer play your music, includ­
ing music you’ve downloaded — unless you’ve bought the music, that 
is, which costs extra. After they’re purchased, however, those individual 
songs are yours to copy to CD or play on other PCs and music players.
	
✓	Xbox Music Pass isn’t cheap, and it’s filled with fine print. But if you 
pony up $10 a month for the service, it’s very convenient — until you 
stop paying, that is. Then your unlimited music disappears, and you’re 
back to ten hours a month of ad-supported music.
Exploring and Buying Music
The Music app’s Explore area lets you browse through the music bins for 
music to add to your own collection. Much like shopping for music on 
Amazon or iTunes, the Explore section lets you hear 30-second snippets of 
music to make sure you’re buying the right songs.
To start browsing and shopping, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Music app from the Start screen and tap Explore from the 
app’s left column.
	
	 The Music app’s Explore section opens, as shown in Figure 11-7.
	
	 The opening screen lets you browse selections devoted to new albums, 
top songs, and top albums.

2.	Tap one of the selections to browse its wares.
	
	 Tap the New Albums category, for example, and the store lets you sort 
the new albums by category — Jazz, for example — as well as subcat­
egories within that genre.
	
	 Spot an album or song you need? Jump to Step 4. If you’re still looking 
for a song, move to the next step.
	
3.	Search for a particular song or artist.
	
	 The Search box atop the left column searches whatever category you’ve 
chosen, be it your own Collection, Radio, or Explore. Because you’re in 
the Explore category, type an artist’s name or song into the Search box 
and press Enter to see the matches.
	
4.	When you’re looking at an item you want to purchase, tap the Buy 
button.
	
	 If you want to buy an entire album, click the Buy Album link to download 
MP3 files of every song on the album.
	
	
	 Want just one song from the album? Then select that song by sliding 
your finger horizontally across the song’s name. The app highlights the 
song, and the App bar along the bottom sprouts a Buy Song button.
	
5.	Pay for the item with the credit card associated with your Microsoft 
account.
	
	 If you don’t have a credit card linked with your Microsoft account, the 
program walks you through the process. After you complete the pur­
chase, the app downloads the music into your collection.
	
	 Purchased music and albums stay in your collection even if you stop 
your Xbox Live Pass subscription.

T

he Start screen and its apps ecosystem specialize in serving up informa­
tion while you’re on the run. You can find appointments, scan the head­
lines, check the e-mail, browse the web, listen to music, and still step onto 
the subway before the doors close. When you sit down, your Surface doubles 
as an e-book reader, letting you browse books, magazines, and newspapers.
What’s missing from the Desktop of the Surface RT 
and Surface 2?
The Surface RT and Surface 2 offer loads of 
battery life and a reduced price compared with 
their Pro counterparts, but they also come with 
reduced power: Their Desktop app isn’t power­
ful enough to run traditional desktop programs. 
You can’t install any new desktop programs 
onto the Surface RT and Surface Pro.
The Desktop app still works on those Surface 
models, however. And when you open the 
Desktop app, you find Microsoft Office’s 
heavyweights  —  Microsoft Outlook, Word, 
PowerPoint, Excel, and OneNote.
Also, these desktop staples are missing from 
Surface RT and Surface 2: WordPad, Windows 
Media Player, Windows Media Center, Sticky 
Notes, and Windows Journal.
On the positive side, the desktop on the Surface 
RT and Surface 2 tablets still includes File 
Explorer for managing files, as well as Paint, 
Notepad, Calculator, and a few other classic 
Windows programs.

Part IV: Work 
But when you need to create, your Surface can mimic a desktop PC. It lets 
you manage files, create documents, and crunch numbers into neatly formed 
columns.
The Desktop app works much like the desktop found in previous Windows 
versions, so I don’t spend time on the basics. Instead, I walk you through the 
most common desktop task a Surface owner needs: transferring files onto 
your Surface so you can access them while on the go.
Changes in Windows 8.1 Update 1
Early in 2014, Microsoft released Windows 8.1 
Update 1, which automatically installs itself 
on your Surface through Windows Update. 
Unofficially referred to as the Spring Update, the 
updates mostly help you navigate Windows 8.1 
more easily with a mouse. If you control your 
Surface with your fingertips, you won’t notice 
many changes.
Nevertheless, the Spring Update brings these 
changes:
✓		 OneDrive: Microsoft changed SkyDrive’s 
name to OneDrive. That’s the only thing 
about the cloud service that changes, 
though; OneDrive behaves just like 
SkyDrive. The SkyDrive Start screen app 
changed its name to OneDrive, and the 
name OneDrive (instead of the name 
SkyDrive) now appears in the navigation 
pane along every folder’s left edge.
✓		 Search and Power icons: Two new icons, 
Search and Power, appear in the Start 
screen’s upper-right corner, next to your 
user account name. For quick searches, 
click (or tap) the magnifying glass icon 
for one-click access to the Charms bar’s 
Search icon. Click or tap the Power icon to 
fetch a drop-down menu, where you can 
choose to put your Surface to sleep, turn it 
off, or restart it.
✓		 Apps on the taskbar: The desktop’s task­
bar — the strip along the desktop’s bottom 
edge — shows icons for currently running 
Start screen apps. You can also pin Start 
screen apps to the taskbar so that you 
can launch them without visiting the Start 
screen.
✓		 Taskbar on the Start screen: When you 
switch from the desktop to the Start screen, 
the desktop’s taskbar temporarily appears 
along the Start screen’s bottom edge. 
(Move the mouse pointer away from the 
taskbar, and the taskbar disappears.)
✓		 App’s top menu: Point your mouse pointer 
at the top of a Start screen app, and a title 
bar appears, listing the app’s name. Close 
the app by clicking the X in the title bar’s 
right corner. Click the app’s icon in the title 
bar’s left corner, and a drop-down menu 
appears, letting you snap the app to the 
screen’s right or left side, or close it.
✓		 Right-click Start screen menus: Instead 
of fetching the Start screen’s hidden App 
bar menu to make changes, you can simply 
right-click the app you want to tweak. A 
pop-up menu appears, letting you unpin the 
app from the Start screen, pin it to the task­
bar, uninstall it completely, or change the 
app’s tile size.
Most Surface owners won’t notice these 
changes, because they’re designed mostly to 
placate desktop owners. But if you spend a lot of 
time with the trackpad on your keyboard cover, 
or if you connect a mouse to your Surface, you 
may find some of these changes useful.

 Chapter 12: Visiting the Windows Desktop
Making the Desktop Finger-Friendly
Although the Desktop app looks like a normal Windows desktop, don’t forget 
it’s just an app. And, as with all other apps, you still have the Charms bar at 
your disposal, making it easy to jump between apps.
The Charms bar is the only portion of the desktop that’s finger-friendly, 
though. The desktop remains rooted in the mouse-pointer-controlled menus 
of yesteryear.
You can make things easier by telling Windows to make everything on the 
desktop larger. After you flip that switch, everything on your desktop expands.
Following these steps packs less information onto the screen. But you’ll at 
least be able to take advantage of the information you see. And these steps 
are reversible, letting you return to mouse-sized controls if needed.
To enlarge everything on the desktop so it’s easier to touch, follow these steps:
	
1.	Launch the Desktop app from the Start screen.
	
	 The traditional Windows desktop fills the screen.
	
	
2.	 Summon the Charms bar by sliding your finger inward from the 
screen’s right edge and then tapping the Settings icon.
	
3.	From the top of the Settings pane, tap Control Panel.
	
	 The desktop’s Control Panel appears.
	
4.	On the Control Panel window, tap the Hardware and Sound category 
and then tap the Display link.
	
	 The Display window appears, as shown in Figure 12-1.
	
5.	In the Change the Size of All Items area, tap the setting Medium - 125% 
and then tap the Apply button.
	
6.	When Windows asks you to sign out of your computer and apply your 
changes, tap the Sign Out Now button.
	
	 If you haven’t saved any work, save it before clicking the Sign Out Now 
button. If you don’t, your hard work disappears.

touch with a 
finger.
When you sign back into your Surface, your desktop will be larger and easier 
to control by touch alone.
	
✓	The larger size affects only the desktop. Your Start screen and apps 
remain unaffected.
Tapping an item from a drop-down menu
When you try to tap on an item from a desktop 
window’s drop-down menu, you’ll rarely hit the 
desired option with your finger on the first try. 
And when you miss, the menu often disappears. 
Drat!
So, when you encounter a drop-down menu — or 
any scrolling menu for that matter — aim and 
tap your finger anywhere on the list, but don’t 
lift your finger.
Instead, slide your finger up or down the list. 
As your finger moves, Windows highlights dif­
ferent choices. When Windows highlights the 
choice you were originally aiming for, lift your 
finger.
This little trick ensures that you make the cor­
rect choice, saving you from tapping repeat­
edly until you eventually land on your desired 
option.

 Chapter 12: Visiting the Windows Desktop
	
✓	If a crucial portion of a desktop window drops off the screen’s bottom, 
turn your Surface sideways; the desktop automatically rotates, leav­
ing you more space along the desktop’s bottom edge. (I explain how to 
maneuver windows with your fingers in this chapter’s “Mastering Basic 
Window Mechanics” section.)
	
✓	If you have a stylus for your Surface, don’t underestimate its power on 
the desktop. It works very well as a makeshift mouse, letting you select 
files and tap buttons, as well as enter and edit text, as I describe in 
Chapter 5.
Mastering Basic Window Mechanics
The key to maneuvering windows on the desktop with your finger is to think 
of your finger as a mouse pointer. Then follow these rules:
	
✓	To move a window around on the screen, use your finger to drag the 
window’s title bar — that thick strip along its top edge. When you drag 
the window to its desired position, lift your finger, and the window stays 
in place.
	
✓	To make a window consume exactly half the screen, drag it with your 
finger all the way to the screen’s right or left edge. As your finger 
reaches the edge, the window begins to resizes itself; lift your finger, and 
the window consumes exactly half of the screen. This helps you position 
two windows side by side, handy when copying files from a flash drive 
to your Surface.
	
	
✓	To close a window, tap the X in its upper-right corner.
	
	
✓	To minimize a window, tap the little line icon near the window’s upper-
right corner.
	
	
✓	To maximize a window, tap the middle of the three icons shown in the 
window’s upper-right corner.
	
✓	To shift your focus from one window to another, tap anywhere on the 
window that needs your attention.
Managing Files and Folders 
by Touch with File Explorer
In older versions of Windows, a program named Windows Explorer lets 
you view your computer’s files and storage spaces, shuffling files between 
them as necessary.
www.it-ebooks.info

240
Part IV: Work 
Windows Explorer lives on but with the new name of File Explorer. And true 
to its predecessor, File Explorer also lets you manage your Surface’s files, 
folders, and storage areas. That makes the program particularly handy for 
moving files on and off your Surface.
To open File Explorer and begin browsing your Surface’s files and storage 
areas, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Desktop app with a tap on its Start screen tile.
	
	
2.	Tap the File Explorer icon (shown in the margin), found on the left 
end of the desktop’s taskbar — that strip along the desktop’s bottom 
edge.
	
	 File Explorer appears, shown in Figure 12-2, letting you manage the files 
on your Surface.
	
3.	To see your Surface’s storage spaces and the files inside them, tap This 
PC from File Explorer’s left pane, called the Navigation pane.
	
	 There, you see all the storage locations accessible by your Surface: its 
internal hard drive, removable memory card, network locations, and any 
storage you’ve plugged into its USB port (including flash drives, portable 
hard drives, and even digital cameras).
	
4.	To see inside a storage area, tap it on the Navigation pane.
	
	 Tap any storage area you see, and File Explorer lists the files stored 
inside. For example, tap any of your Surface’s main storage areas (your 
Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos folders) to see their contents. 
You can also tap your Surface’s memory card, or icons for any flash 
drives, or portable hard drives. You can even see photos stored on a 
camera you’ve attached with its USB cable.
When you want to copy or move files or folders from one place to another, 
Windows makes you take two steps: First you select the items; second, you 
copy or move them to their new location.
The next section explains how to select items, be it files on a newly inserted 
flash drive or folders stored on a network. The section after that explains 
how to copy or move your selected items to a new destination on your 
Surface. (It also explains how to rename or delete selected files.)
Although desktop windows contain scroll bars, it’s hard to position your fin­
gertip inside those narrow bars. Instead, slide your finger up or down directly 
inside the Navigation pane; that scrolls the pane’s contents up or down. The 
same applies to the items you see in the File Explorer window’s left side.

Selecting files and folders with a fingertip
	
To select several items, hold down the Ctrl key on your Surface’s keyboard 
while clicking items with the trackpad’s mouse pointer or a mouse. Simple.
Selecting items or groups of desktop items with your fingers, by contrast, can 
be one of a Surface’s most maddening chores. It’s fairly easy to select one item: 
just tap it, and Windows highlights it, showing that it’s selected. But when you 
tap a second item, Windows selects that item instead, deselecting the first.
www.it-ebooks.info

242
Part IV: Work 
How do you select more than one item just by using your fingers? The key 
is a precisely placed tap under just the right conditions. The following steps 
show how to select items when you’ve detached your keyboard or folded it 
back to use your Surface as a tablet:
	
1.	Open File Explorer and navigate to the drive or folder containing the 
items you want to copy or move to your tablet.
	
	
	 Open File Explorer with a tap of its icon (shown in the margin) on the 
taskbar — that strip running along the desktop’s bottom edge. When File 
Explorer appears, examine the Navigation pane along its left edge: It lists 
all of your Surface’s storage areas.
	
	 Tap the storage area containing your items; that storage area’s contents 
appear in File Explorer. Double-tap a flash drive, network location, or 
folder to open it. Keep digging until you’ve found the location of the item 
to be copied or moved.
	
2.	Switch to Details view.
	
	 File Explorer lets you view items in many different ways, and Details 
view makes it easiest to select things with your fingers. So, tap the View 
tab along the Ribbon’s top edge and then tap Details in the Layout sec­
tion. File Explorer displays the items in Details view: rows of names of 
files and folders.
	
3.	To select a file, tap just to the left of a file’s icon to make a check box 
containing a check mark appear next to the file’s icon.
	
	 This is the trickiest part. With the tip of your smallest finger, tap just to 
the left of the file’s or folder’s name. When you tap in just the right spot, 
you place a check mark in the box that appears, as shown in Figure 12-3.
As you quickly discover, this takes practice. If just one tap is off, Windows 
deselects everything and selects only what you’ve just tapped. Keep trying, 
and you’ll eventually find the sweet spot, just to the left of the icon.
After you select the items you want, move to the next section, “Copying or 
moving files and folders.”
	
✓	On the Start screen, a tap opens an item. On the desktop, by contrast, a 
tap selects an item. The desktop requires a double-tap — two quick taps 
in succession — to open an item.
	
✓	To select all the items in a folder, tap the Select All check mark. (It’s next 
to the word Name atop the Name column shown in Figure 12-3.)
	
✓	When selecting many items, it’s sometimes easier to tap the Select All 
check mark and then tap to deselect unwanted items.

✓	To delete your selected items, tap the Ribbon’s Home tab and then tap 
the Delete icon (shown in the margin).
	
✓	If you have a stylus for your Surface, it’s often easier to select and dese­
lect items by tapping their check boxes with the tip of the stylus.
	
✓	You can also lasso adjacent items using your finger or stylus: Draw a 
rectangle around your desired items, and Windows selects them for you.
	
✓	After fiddling around with your fingers on the desktop for a few minutes, 
you see why a mouse, trackpad, or stylus can be invaluable for preci­
sion desktop operations. In case you didn’t buy a Surface Touch or Type 
Cover keyboard, I describe how to attach mice and keyboards, both 
wired and Bluetooth, in Chapter 6. (I give tips on buying and using a 
stylus in Chapter 5.)
Copying or moving files and folders
As you discovered in the previous section, selecting items with your fingers 
can be time-consuming. But after you’ve selected the items, it’s easy to copy 
or move them to a new location by following these steps:
	
1.	From File Explorer, tap the Home tab near the top-left corner.
	
	 The Ribbon changes to show the icons shown in Figure 12-4.
	
2.	Tap the Move To or the Copy To icon.
	
	 A menu drops down from your tapped icon, listing locations where 
you’ve previously saved items.

3.	If you spot your destination, tap it to complete the process. If you don’t 
see your location, choose the entry at the list’s bottom: Choose Location.
	
	 The Copy Items or Move Items window appears for you to choose the 
destination for your selected files.
	
4.	Select the destination from the window and then tap the Copy or 
Move icon to send your items to their new destination.
	
	 The Copy Items dialog box, shown in Figure 12-5, works much like a 
tiny Navigation pane that you see along the left edge of every folder. 
Tap Libraries to send your items to your Documents, Music, Pictures or 
Videos libraries, for example.
	
	 Or, to send items to a flash drive, tap your flash drive from the drives 
listed in the window’s Computer section.
	
	 When you’ve chosen your items’ resting place, tap the Copy or Move 
icon. (The icon’s name depends on whether you tapped the Copy To or 
Move To icons in Step 2.)
	
You can enlarge the Copy/Move dialog box by dragging its bottom-right corner 
outward with your finger. That brings more items into view.

Launching Desktop Programs
Although the Desktop app may seem like a self-contained world, it isn’t. The 
Desktop app tosses you back onto the Start screen on several occasions, 
most noticeably when you want to load a program.
Where did my libraries go?
Introduced in Windows 7, libraries provide 
a handy way to view the contents of several 
folders within one window. In Windows 7 and 
Windows 8, every folder lists Libraries in the 
Navigation pane. A click on the Music library, 
for example, shows the contents of both your 
own Music folder and your PC’s Public Music 
folder. (Any account holder can access the 
public folders, making them a convenient way 
for different account holders to share files.)
Windows 8.1 dropped libraries from the Navigation 
pane and replaced it with OneDrive, Microsoft’s 
new name for its Internet-based file storage ser­
vice formerly known as SkyDrive. The libraries still 
exist, though, and they’re easy to place back onto 
the Navigation pane: Right-click a blank portion 
of any folder’s Navigation pane and choose Show 
Libraries from the pop-up menu.
To add a folder to a library, right-click the folder 
and choose Include in Library from the pop-up 
menu. When a second pop-up menu lists your 
libraries, choose the library that should receive 
the folder.
For example, if you store your music in a folder 
named Tunes on your Surface’s memory card, 
add it to your Music library by right-clicking the 
Tunes folder, choosing Include in Library, and 
choosing the Music library from the pop-up 
menus.

The Surface RT and Surface 2 can run only their bundled desktop programs. 
However, you can easily launch their bundled Office programs by tapping their 
icons on the taskbar along the desktop’s bottom edge.
Follow these steps to load a desktop program:
	
1.	Return to the Start screen.
	
	 You can return to the Start screen by tapping the Start icon in the desk­
top’s bottom-left corner. Or, you can press your Surface’s Windows 
button, press a keyboard’s Windows key, or swipe in from your Surface’s 
right side and tap the Charms bar’s Windows icon.
	
2.	Tap your desired program’s icon from the Start screen.
	
	 I describe how to load programs from the Start screen in Chapter 4, but 
here are some quick tips:
 
• If your desired program doesn’t have a tile on the Start screen, 
swipe up from the middle of your Surface’s screen. The Start screen 
changes to show icons for all of your installed apps and programs.
 
• Desktop programs appear along the All Apps screen’s farthest right 
edge.
When you tap the desktop program’s icon, Windows returns you to the 
Desktop app and begins running the program on the desktop.
Snapping an App Alongside Another App
The Windows Start screen and Desktop app live in very separate worlds. The 
Start screen is “modern,” whereas the Desktop app is “traditional.” They look 
and behave nothing alike, and, for the most part, they each work apart from 
the other.
When a program isn’t a program
Eager to promote its new Start screen system 
of computing, your Surface refers to its Start 
screen programs as apps. However, your 
Surface also refers to desktop programs as 
apps. In Windows 8 and 8.1, the word program 
no longer exists.
But because the entire computer industry will 
take some time to scrub the word program 
from its menus, software boxes, and websites, 
this book isn’t scrubbing away the history of 
computing.
In this book, programs that run on the desktop 
are called programs. Programs that run on the 
Start screen are called apps.

Sometimes, though, it’s helpful to mix the two, perhaps placing your Calendar 
app next to your desktop to show your next appointment.
Windows does that with a feat called snapping an app, and the result looks 
like Figure 12-6.

Snapping

Adding desktop programs to the taskbar
To skip some trips to the Start screen, add your 
favorite desktop programs to the desktop’s 
taskbar — that strip along the desktop’s bottom 
edge. To stock your taskbar with your favorite 
programs, follow these steps:
	 1.	 From the Start screen, slide your finger 
up from the middle to reveal the All Apps 
screen.
	
	 The Start screen reveals icons for every 
app and program installed on your Surface.
	 2.	 Select a favorite desktop program by hold­
ing down your finger on its icon until the App 
bar appears along the screen’s bottom edge.
	 3.	 From the App bar, tap the Pin to Taskbar icon.
	
	 The next time you visit the desktop, that 
coveted program’s icon is waiting on the 
taskbar, where you can launch it with a tap. 
By stocking the taskbar with your favorite 
programs, you can minimize your trips to the 
Start screen.

Follow these steps to snap any Start screen app to the side of the Desktop 
app or any other app:
	
1.	Open the Desktop app and then return to the Start screen and open 
your desired Start screen app.
	
	 To reach the Start screen from the desktop, tap the Start button or press 
the Windows key at the bottom of the screen. Find the app you want 
to view alongside the desktop and then tap the app to bring it to the 
screen.
	
	 Although I’m using the Desktop app in this example, these steps work 
for placing any app side-by-side with another app. Just substitute a dif­
ferent app for the Desktop app example I use here.
	
2.	Switch back to the desktop.
	
	 Slide your finger inward from the screen’s left edge, dragging the desk­
top back onto the screen.
	
3.	Snap the app against your desktop.
	
	 This is the tricky part: Slowly drag your finger inward from the screen’s 
left edge; your most recently opened app appears, following along with 
the motion of your finger. When you see a vertical strip appear onscreen, 
lift your finger; the app snaps itself to the screen’s left edge.
When the app snaps against the desktop’s left edge, a small vertical bar sepa­
rates it from your desktop. The snapped app stays in place even if you head 
back to the Start screen and run a few apps. When you return to the desktop, 
your snapped app remains stuck to the desktop’s side.
App snapping works well for a few tasks, but it includes more rules than a 
rebate coupon:
	
✓	You can’t snap an app to the side of the Start screen.
	
✓	You can’t snap an app onto each side of your desktop unless you con­
nect your Surface to a high-resolution external monitor, described in 
Chapter 6. (Alternatively, you can shrink your Start screen tile size, 
described in Chapter 14, but that makes the Start screen’s menus too 
small for easy use.)
	
✓	To unsnap the app, use your finger to drag that vertical bar back toward 
the screen’s closest edge.
	
✓	You can make snapped apps slightly wider or narrower by sliding the 
vertical bar to the left or right.
	
✓	Not all apps perform well when snapped. Some become so tiny they’re 
nearly unusable.
	
✓	To unsnap a snapped app, drag the vertical line back to the screen’s 
closest edge. When that vertical line reaches the edge, the snapped app 
unsnaps.

Upgrading to Windows Media Center
The Windows Desktop app doesn’t offer much 
to owners of the Surface RT and Surface 2. But 
on the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2, the desk­
top is a fully functioning version of Windows 8.1 
Pro. That’s right: Those models are powerful 
desktop PCs that are flattened into a tablet.
Like all versions of Windows 8.1 Pro, you can 
upgrade your Surface Pro or Surface Pro 2 to 
Windows Media Center for only $10. Designed 
to run on a television set screen, Windows 
Media Center never really took off on desktop 
PCs. But tablets give this powerful piece of soft­
ware new life.
If you’re already recording TV shows with 
Windows Media Center on your desktop PC, by 
all means, upgrade your Surface Pro or Surface 
Pro 2 to Windows Media Center so you can 
watch your recorded shows on your Surface. 
To upgrade to Windows Media Center, follow 
these steps:
	 1.	 From any screen, fetch the Charms bar by 
sliding your finger inward from the screen’s 
right edge. Then tap the Search icon.
	 2.	 Type the words add features into the 
Search box and press Enter.
	 3.	 Tap the Add Features to Windows 8.1 link 
when it appears below the Search box.
	
	 The Add Features to Windows 8.1 window 
appears.
	 4.	 Tap the words I Want to Buy a Product Key 
Online.
	
	 The window lists Windows 8.1 Media 
Center Pack.
	 5.	 Tap the Choose button, fill out your billing 
information if necessary, and tap the Next 
button.
	 6.	 Follow the steps to purchase and enter a 
product key.
When you finish, your Surface Pro or Pro 
2 restarts. When it returns to the screen, 
Windows Media Center appears as a tile on the 
Start screen’s All Apps area. By adding a USB 
TV Tuner connected to a TV signal, you can even 
record TV shows for later viewing on the road.

t’s no coincidence that the Surface RT and Surface 2 include a free, 
installed copy of Microsoft’s Office Home and Student 2013 RT.
That suite of programs — Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and OneNote — are 
all that many people need. For those who need more, the two tablets also 
include the Office 2013 RT version of Outlook, a powerful e-mail program for 
the desktop.
Your Surface RT or Surface 2 can read, save, and create Office files stored 
nearly anywhere: on your Surface, a flash drive, a networked PC, or on 
OneDrive, the online storage place accessible by any brand of PC, tablet, or 
smartphone.
This chapter helps bring you up to speed on the basics of opening, saving, 
and printing Office files. (Office programs don’t come installed on the Surface 
Pro or Surface Pro 2, unfortunately, so this chapter doesn’t apply to those 
models unless you buy and install the program.)
Note: The updated versions of Office and Outlook appear on the Surface RT 
after you update it to Windows 8.1. RT, described in Chapter 1.

Opening, Saving, and Printing 
in Office 2013 RT
	
	 Microsoft’s Office Home and Student 2013 RT includes popular programs 
designed specifically to run on the Surface RT and Surface 2:
	
	
✓	Word: The industry-standard word processor, Word lets you create any­
thing from letters to party flyers to table-filled reports.
	
	
✓	PowerPoint: If you’ve sat through a corporate presentation shown on a 
projector or large TV, you’ve probably seen PowerPoint in action.
	
	
✓	Excel: A staple of accountants, Excel creates large tables for calculat­
ing complex formulas, handy for everything from household budgets to 
stock market projections.
Although the three programs do very different things, they all open, save, and 
print files in the same way.
The following sections walk you through each step of opening, saving, and 
printing files. I also explain how to save time by starting work with a free tem­
plate — a preformatted document where you need only fill in the blanks.
	
	 OneNote, a note-organizing program, works a little differently, so I give it a 
separate section near this chapter’s end.
	
	 Outlook, the full-featured e-mail program, receives its own section at this 
chapter’s end.
Opening a document
Whether you want to create a new document, open an existing one, or start 
working from a template, follow these steps to open a document in Word, 
Excel, or PowerPoint:
	
1.	From the Start screen, tap the tile of the program you want to open: 
Word, Excel, or PowerPoint.
	
	 If you don’t spot your desired program on the Start screen, you can also 
launch it directly from the desktop: Tap the Desktop app’s tile. When the 
desktop appears, tap your desired program’s icon from the desktop’s task­
bar, that strip along the bottom, and your chosen program fills the screen.
	
2.	When your chosen program appears, tap the file you’d like to open.
	
	
	 Microsoft Word, for example, shown in Figure 13-1, demonstrates how 
each program offers four ways of starting work:

 Chapter 13: Working in Microsoft Office 2013
 
• Open a recently accessed document. The Recent pane along the 
left edge lists your seven most-recently accessed documents. Tap 
a document’s name, and it returns to the screen, ready for more 
work.
 
• Start a new document. Tap the Blank Document icon, and the pro­
gram presents a blank page, ready for you to begin creating a new 
document from scratch.
 
• Open a template. Office’s time-saving templates come preformat­
ted, letting you concentrate on the content rather than the format 
or design. I give templates their own section later in this chapter.
 
• Search for a new template. Hundreds of free templates await 
online. For example, type resume into the Search box, press the 
Enter key, and choose among dozens of preformatted resumes.

a Tour. By all means, tap the Take a Tour icon 
even if you’re familiar with the program. It offers 
a short guide and tips for how to put the pro­
gram to work.
It’s short, and it introduces some new features 
introduced in Office Home and Student 2013 RT, 
which Microsoft released in October, 2012. (The 
programs can still open documents created in 
older versions of the program.)

	 To open a listed document, tap its name. Still don’t see it? Then tap one 
of the Open window’s five main storage areas:
 
• Recent Documents: The opening screen shown earlier in Figure 13-1 
lists only your past seven recently accessed documents. This area, 
however, shows the past 24 documents you’ve opened. If you’ve 
opened the document before, chances are good that it’s listed here, 
waiting to be opened with a tap.
 
• OneDrive: Tap here to open files stored on OneDrive, your online 
storage space covered in Chapter 6. By storing your files on 
OneDrive, you can work on them either from your Surface or your 
desktop PC.
 
• Other Web Locations: Most often used by corporations, this 
option lets you access folders stored on other websites.
 
• Computer: A popular choice, this option shows recently browsed 
folders. It also offers a Browse button, where you can open files 
already stored on your Surface or any files stored on an attached 
flash drive or portable hard drive.
 
• Add a Place: Tap this shortcut to add other online storage places 
as Microsoft begins supporting them.
	
	 Tap the Browse button to navigate to documents inside a storage area.
Then open your desired document with a tap on its name.
	
When you’re having trouble finding a document, try any of these tips:
	
✓	When searching for a document you’ve worked on previously, scan 
the Recent sections first. Tap likely suspects and take a peek. Guessed 
wrong? Close them with a tap on the File tab along the top and then a 
tap on the Close button in the program’s left pane. Tap the Open button 
to start again.
	
✓	Can’t find a document anywhere? Fetch the Charms bar by sliding your 
finger inward from the screen’s right edge and then tap the Search icon. 
In the Search box, begin typing a keyword contained in your wayward 
document. Below the Search box, your Surface lists every file containing 
the word you typed.
	
✓	To find and edit a file stored on a newly inserted flash drive or portable 
hard drive, tap Computer in Step 3 and then tap the Browse button. 
When a miniature File Explorer window appears, tap your flash drive’s 
letter in the This PC section of the Navigation pane along the miniature 
window’s right edge.
	
✓	You can also open documents directly from File Explorer. If you spot 
your desired document on your recently inserted flash drive, double-tap 
its name: The program that created the document appears with your 
document in tow.

Part IV: Work 
Starting from a template
In days of old, people often started from scratch with a sheet of paper. Yet 
that paper could probably be called a template: the preformatted lines across 
the page gave people something to follow as they wrote.
Today’s templates offer much more than simple lines. Microsoft offers thou­
sands of free templates for creating elaborate resumes, reports, invitations, 
schedules, calendars, or even stock reports that automatically create them­
selves when you type in a stock symbol.
When you find yourself waiting for inspiration in front of an empty screen, 
head for the templates. It’s much easier to create something when you need 
only fill in the blanks.
To start working from a template, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Start screen, tap the tile of the program you want to open: 
Word, Excel, or PowerPoint.
	
2.	When the program appears, tap the template you want to open and 
then tap Create to open the template.
	
	 Figure 13-1, earlier in this chapter, lists just a few of the many free tem­
plates available, sorted by current popularity. During the holidays, you 
see more party invitations in Word, for example; in September, you see 
more templates for school activities.
The fine print
The version of Office Home and Student 2013 
bundled with the Surface with Windows RT is 
the real thing: It’s almost identical to the ver­
sion of Office Home and Student 2013 sold in 
the stores for “normal” desktop computers. 
Microsoft explains the details of the differences 
at http://office.com/officeRT.
In short, the programs may not support some 
macros, add-ins, or other custom-written 
programs.
The biggest issue could be that the programs 
are licensed for non-commercial use only. To 
legally create documents for work, your busi­
ness needs a licensing contract with Microsoft 
with commercial-use license coverage. Ask 
your company’s IT person to see whether 
you qualify and what additional options are 
available.

Word, Excel, and PowerPoint offer thousands of templates from a wide vari­

rather than starting from scratch.
	
✓	To save space, Microsoft didn’t bundle Office templates with your 
Surface. You must be connected to the Internet to download them.
	
✓	Before beginning a project, spend some time browsing and downloading 
potential templates. That way you can still work from a template when 
offline.
	
✓	To browse Microsoft’s templates with Internet Explorer, visit http://
office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates. Templates you down­
load await you in your Surface’s Downloads folder, available in the 
Navigation pane along the left edge of every folder. (The selections avail­
able on Internet Explorer are the same as the selections built into the 
program, and they can be used in the same way.)
Saving your work
As soon as you begin creating your document, save it. By saving it, you’ve 
done two things:

Add a Place.
	
	 Choose OneDrive if you plan on accessing the document from other 
computers or sharing it online with others.
	
	 To keep it on your Surface or to e-mail it to others, choose Computer

and app on your Surface can easily access files stored inside that folder.
	
3.	Choose a name for your document and tap the Save button.

Taking Notes with OneNote
A computerized three-ring tabbed binder, Microsoft’s OneNote organizes 
your notes. It’s not picky, letting you add notes in any form: typed by hand, 
copied from websites, recorded as audio, captured as a photograph or video, 
or even handwritten with a stylus on the Surface’s screen.
Many students embrace OneNote because it lets them open a section for a 
class, such as a Chemistry section, and then create a new tab for each new 
lecture or subject, filling it with freeform notes, including photos of the black­
board or hand-written equations.
OneNote organizes your notes in three main ways:
	
✓	Notebooks: Everything starts with a notebook, which holds all of your 
notes. You can create as many notebooks as you want, each designed 
around its own theme. OneNote starts with two notebooks: The Personal 
notebook contains notes dealing with you and your home; the Work 
notebook helps you track your work-related projects.
	
✓	Categories: Each notebook can have several categories to separate your 
projects. The Home notebook could have a Remodeling category, for 
example, as well as a Shopping List category.
	
✓	Pages: Here’s where you break down your categories even further. The 
Home notebook’s Recipe category could have a page for each recipe.
Follow these steps to create a new Notebook in OneNote, add new categories, 
and add pages to the categories:
	
1.	Open OneNote, tap File from the top menu, and tap New. Then choose 
a location and name for your new notebook.
	
	
	 Tap the OneNote icon from the desktop’s taskbar along the bottom, or 
tap the OneNote tile on the Start screen.

262
Part IV: Work 
	
	 To create a new notebook, begin by choosing a storage location, usually 
OneDrive, so it can be accessed from any of your computers. Then type 
a name for your notebook, for example, Shopping List.
	
2.	Choose whether to share your notebook with others.
	
	 When the Microsoft OneNote window appears, you can tap the Invite 
People button to give others access to your OneNote file. That’s handy 
when you’re creating projects at work, for example, or creating a shop­
ping list that can be on every family member’s phone.
	
	 To keep it private, tap the Not Now button; you can always share it later.
	
3.	Type notes into your project, adding Categories and Pages as needed.
	
	 OneNote appears, as shown in Figure 13-7, letting you add Categories 
and pages to organize your notes. If you want, save time by starting from 
a template: Tap Insert from the top menu, choose Page Templates from 
the drop-down menu, and choose from the templates offered on the 
screen’s right edge.
Figure 13-7:

Shopping 
List 
­notebook 
shows two 
categories 
and three 
pages.
www.it-ebooks.info

263
 Chapter 13: Working in Microsoft Office 2013
	
4.	To add a category tab, tap the plus sign to the right of the last tab and 
then type the category’s name.
	
	 The notebook in Figure 13-7 offers two categories: one for 99 Ranch 
Supermarket, the other for a local health food store. Each category con­
tains a shopping list for a different store.
	
	 To change or delete a tabbed category, rest your finger on its tab until 
the pop-up menu appears and then choose your option.
	
5.	To add a page to the currently viewed category, tap the words Add 
Page atop the right column and type in a page name.
	
	 For example, the 99 Ranch category lists some recipes for favorite 
dishes, making it easy to look over the ingredient list while at the store.
When you’re through taking notes, simply stop and close the program with a 
tap on the X in its upper-right corner. The program automatically saves your 
work with the name and location you chose in Step 1.
Microsoft offers its OneNote program for desktop PCs, Apple computers, and 
every smartphone, letting you access your notes from nearly any location. 
As soon as you make a change in a OneNote document from any device, it’s 
automatically updated for all of your other devices.
One caveat: The RT version of OneNote won’t let you record audio directly 
into the program. But you can record audio with a different app and embed 
the audio file into the program.
Adding E-Mail Accounts to Outlook
If you think that the Start screen’s Mail, People, and Calendar apps don’t have 
enough features, Outlook might be a welcome replacement. Whereas the 
Start screen’s app offers a skeletal approach to basic communication tasks, 
Outlook is the full beast, writhing with options to handle your mail, calendar, 
and contacts.
For most people, however, Outlook is overkill on a tablet.
	
✓	Outlook’s power adds extra layers of complications to what should be 
quick and simple tasks.
	
✓	Outlook requires a commitment to the desktop, defeating the purpose of 
a tablet.
	
✓	Desktop programs don’t communicate well with Start screen apps. Unless 
you log into both your tablet and Outlook with the same Microsoft account, 
your contacts won’t sync between Outlook and the People app.

Part IV: Work 
For simplicity’s sake, you should probably choose between either Outlook or 
the Start screen’s Mail, People, and Calendar suite of programs, but not both.
If you still want to give Outlook a try, follow these steps to open Outlook for 
the first time and add your e-mail account:
	
1.	From the Start screen, tap the Outlook 2013 tile.
	
	
	 If you don’t spot the Outlook 2013 tile on the Start screen, look in the All 
Apps area by sliding your finger up from the middle of the Start screen. 
When the All Apps area slides into view, scroll to the Microsoft Office 2013 
group near the screen’s right edge and then tap the Outlook 2013 tile.
	
2.	When the Welcome to Microsoft Outlook 2013 window appears, tap Next.
	
	 The program immediately asks whether you want to set up an e-mail 
account.
	
	 If the program doesn’t ask whether you want to set up an e-mail account, 
tap the File tab in its upper-left corner and tap the Account Settings 
button. Choose Account Settings from the drop-down menu. When the 
Account Settings window appears, tap the New icon on the E-Mail tab. 
Then jump to Step 4.
	
3.	Tap the Yes button and then tap the Next button.
	
	 The Add Accounts window appears, as shown in Figure 13-8, ready for 
you to add your e-mail account’s information.

 Chapter 13: Working in Microsoft Office 2013
	
4.	Enter your name, e-mail address, and password in the Add Accounts 
window and then tap Next.
	
	 When you tap Next, Outlook connects with the Internet and tries to 
discover your ISP’s mail settings, sparing you the trouble of entering 
them yourself. If Outlook succeeds, it tells you so, and you’re done. If it 
doesn’t succeed, move to Step 5.
	
5.	Tap the Manual Setup or Additional Server Types button and click 
Next.
	
	 The Add Account window appears, this time ready for you to enter your 
own e-mail settings.
	
6.	Enter your mail server settings, tapping the Next button at each 
prompt.
	
	 If you don’t have your mail server settings, you need to contact your 
e-mail provider and ask for these tidbits of technical information:
 
• Your e-mail type: This is usually IMAP or POP3.
 
• Your incoming mail server name: This is usually a bit of gibberish 
like pop.microsoft.com.
 
• Your outgoing mail server name: Just like your incoming mail 
server name, this is something like smtp.microsoft.com.
	
7.	Tap Finish to complete setting up your account.
	
	 Or, to set up another e-mail account, tap Add Another Account and 
return to Step 4.
When you finish, Outlook leaves you at your e-mail Inbox, where you can see 
the test message left by Outlook.

Changing Set tings
In This Chapter
▶	Changing the settings of a Start screen app
▶	Customizing your Surface’s settings
▶	Adjusting OneDrive settings
J

ust about everything comes with settings — ways to change its behavior. 
Your toaster, for example, lets you choose between light and dark. Some 
toasters even offer a defrost or bagel mode.
Your Surface offers much more complex settings, of course. But quite often 
the task of finding the right switch consumes more time than deciding which 
way to flip it.
That’s where this chapter comes in. It explains where to locate the settings 
of your favorite apps, as well as how to find the right switch to make your 
Surface behave a little better.
This chapter explores every portion of the Start screen’s PC Settings area, 
a formidable array of switches that lets you customize your Surface to your 
liking.
	
To jump straight to any setting described in this chapter, fetch the Charms 
bar, tap Search, and type the setting’s name or description in the Search box. 
Your Surface will place a link to the setting beneath the Search box for quick 
one-tap access.
Tweaking an App’s Settings
Your Surface’s apps almost always hide their menus. That’s fine when the 
app behaves correctly. But if you want to change one of your apps, Windows 
offers several ways to tweak it — if you know where to look.
www.it-ebooks.info

268
Part IV: Work 
To find and change the settings of any app, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the app that you want to change.
	
	 Your apps carry their settings with them; you need to open the app 
before you can access its settings.
	
2.	Open the Charms bar and tap the Settings icon.
	
	 The app’s Settings pane appears.
That’s it; every app includes a hidden Settings pane that lists just about 
every behavior that can be changed.
Granted, some apps offer more control than others. But when you find your­
self dismayed with an app’s behavior, head for the Settings pane to see the 
controls it offers. (To close the Settings pane, tap the screen, away from the 
Settings pane.)
	
For a start, these settings may come in handy:
	
✓	If you add more than one account to the Calendar app, you may find 
some overlap: Holidays may appear twice, for example. To weed out 
the duplicates, open the Calendar app’s Settings pane and tap Options. 
There, you can pick and choose which Calendars should display which 
events, and in which color.
	
✓	Tired of typing passwords at your favorite websites? From the Start 
screen’s Internet Explorer, open the Settings pane. There, under Options, 
you can flip the Passwords toggle; that tells the browser to ask whether 
you’d like to save your password.
	
✓	When traveling, you may want the Camera app to tag each photo with 
your location (the name of the city where you snapped the photo). To 
toggle that feature on or off, open the Camera app’s Settings pane, tap 
Options, and tap the Location Info toggle switch.
	
✓	When shooting photos that you plan to post online, think twice before 
tagging photos with their location. Some people don’t want their locations 
made publicly available.
	
✓	Some apps pack so many options on the Settings pane that they scroll 
off the bottom. To make sure you’re seeing all of the options, slide 
your finger up the pane, dragging the formerly hidden options back 
into view.

 Chapter 14: Changing Settings
Customizing Your Surface 
through PC Settings
When tweaking an app doesn’t do the trick, call in the big guns. The Start 
screen’s control panel, called the PC Settings screen, lets you tweak different 
parts of your Surface in surprising detail.
Shown in Figure 14-1, the PC Settings screen contains two columns. The pane 
on the left lists the categories of settings; tap a category, and that category’s 
options spill out toward the right.
Figure 14-1: 
The PC 
Settings 
screen lets 
you custom-
ize your 
Surface’s 
behavior.
Follow these steps to open the PC Settings screen and begin tweaking your 
Surface:
	
	
1.	 From any screen, slide your finger inward from the right edge to fetch 
the Charms bar and then tap the Settings icon.
	
2.	When the Settings pane appears, tap the words Change PC Settings at 
the bottom edge.
	
	 The PC Settings screen, shown earlier in Figure 14-1, opens to show one 
of two possible views:
 
• Personalize: Shown in Figure 14-1, this view offers shortcuts to 
settings that customize three things: the Lock screen that appears 
when you turn on or wake up your Surface, your account photo, 
and a picture password.
www.it-ebooks.info

270
Part IV: Work 
 
• Recent: This view lists shortcuts to your most recently accessed 
settings, which is handy when your last switch flip made a situa­
tion even worse. (Your most recently changed setting appears atop 
the list.)
	
	 To toggle between the Personalize and Recent opening views, scroll to 
the opening screen’s bottom edge. There, you can find a link to fetch the 
alternative screen.
The following sections explain each category in the PC Settings area, as well 
as the settings most likely needing a bit of tweaking. The changes you make, 
usually by tapping a toggle switch, take place immediately.
	
✓	When you tap the Charms bar’s Settings icon, the Settings pane appears, 
which lists your six most commonly accessed settings along the bottom: 
Wi-Fi, Volume, Screen, Notifications, Power, and Keyboard. I describe 
them all in Chapter 4.
	
✓	Settings that deal primarily with the Windows desktop can be found in 
the Desktop app’s Control Panel. To visit there, open the PC Settings 
area and tap the Control Panel link from the bottom left of the PC 
Settings pane.
	
✓	The PC Settings area is chock-full of mundane settings, so although I’ve 
listed them all, I’ve called out the most useful ones with a Tip icon.
PCs and Devices
By far the most crowded entry, the PCs and Devices category deals mostly 
with physical items: your Surface, its display, and connected gadgets like 
mice or keyboards.
Here’s the rundown on the PCs and Devices screen, shown in Figure 14-2:
	
✓	Lock screen: Visit here to choose your favorite photo to display on your 
Surface’s Lock screen. This area also lets you choose which apps can 
display information on the Lock screen: your number of waiting e-mails, 
for example, or your next appointment.
	
✓	Display: This lets you adjust your screen’s resolution — a nerdy term 
describing the number of pixels on your screen. Rarely needed on the 
Start screen, this setting is better adjusted through the Desktop app to 
make it more finger-friendly, as I describe in Chapter 12.
	
✓	Bluetooth: Visit here as well to add Bluetooth accessories, such as mice, 
keyboards, microphones, and similar cable-less gadgets. (I describe 
the process in Chapter 6.) This area also lets you remove gadgets you 
no longer use. If you’re running low on batteries, head here to turn off 
Bluetooth until your next recharge.
www.it-ebooks.info

271
 Chapter 14: Changing Settings
	
✓	Devices: The catch-all for non-Bluetooth gadgets, this area lists nearly 
every gadget attached to your Surface. In a bit of a letdown, though, it 
doesn’t let you adjust the gadget’s settings. You can remove an unused 
gadget only by tapping its name and then tapping on the subsequent 
Remove Device button.
	
✓	Mouse and Touchpad: Left-handed Surface owners should visit here 
to swap the left and right buttons on their mouse and touchpad. The 
Touchpad area, viewable when you attach a Touch or Type Cover key­
board, lets you adjust the touchpad’s sensitivity, which is handy when a 
shirt sleeve sends your mouse cursor flying.
	
✓	Typing: Drop by here to tweak the onscreen keyboard’s sometimes over­
zealous AutoCorrect behavior. Be sure to add the last option, Add the 
Standard Keyboard Layout as a Touch Keyboard Option, which adds the 
full-sized keyboard layout to your Surface’s selection of onscreen key­
board. As I describe in Chapter 5, the standard keyboard includes keys 
missing from the normal keyboard.
	
✓	Corners and Edges: Cherished mostly by mouse-wielding desktop fans, 
this lets you change what happens when you point in the screen’s upper 
corners. (Most desktop users visit here to prevent the Charms bar and 
Recent Apps bar from appearing when their mouse touches the screen’s 
top corners.) You can also toggle whether the desktop’s taskbar should 
list Start screen apps.
	
✓	Power and Sleep: When your Surface goes to sleep much too quickly, 
visit here to increase the two-minute delay to something more conve­
nient. (You can also tell the screen to stay on longer when plugged in 
than when running on batteries.) Bonus: Visit here to disable the screen 
brightness control, which annoyingly changes the screen’s brightness 
according to changes in your room’s lighting.

Part IV: Work 
	
✓	AutoPlay: This area lets you choose how your Surface behaves when 
you plug in a particular gadget. For example, you can tell it to show 
you the contents of a newly inserted flash drive automatically, without 
having to ask.
	
	When in doubt about a gadget’s AutoPlay settings, choose the Ask Me 
Every Time setting. You can always change the setting to something 
more specific when you’re sure how you want the gadget to behave.
	
✓	Disk Space: Helpful when trying to free up disk space, this lists your 
apps, main folders, and the amount of space they each consume.
	
✓	PC Info: A gem when you’re online with tech support, this area lists all 
your Surface’s details. It also lists Microsoft’s tech support phone line 
for your country, as well as a link to online tech support. (Drop by here 
to change your Surface’s name, as well, if you have trouble recognizing it 
on networks.)
Accounts
Chances are good that you’ll visit the Accounts category for one reason: to 
take a new selfie and use your smiling mug as a new User Account photo in 
the upper-right corner of your Start screen.
But if you want to hang around, these three areas await:
	
✓	Your Account: Drop by here to snap your photo for your account or to 
browse to one already on your Surface.
	
✓	Sign-In Options: This section lets you change your password, switch 
to a picture password, or even a four-digit number password, as if you 
were at an ATM. One gem hides here: Normally, you need to reenter your 
password after the display has been off for 15 minutes. Here, you can 
change that to Never Require a Password, a boon for people who rarely 
leave their Surface unattended.
	
✓	Other Accounts: Visit this section to set up standard accounts for 
other people who may use your Surface or even everybody in your 
family. If you’re adding a child, choose Turn On Family Safety so you can 
both restrict and monitor little Timmy’s behavior. Also, this area lets 
you change an existing account to either Standard (untrustworthy) or 
Administrator level (trusted completely).
	
	Newly added users need to follow the walkthrough steps in Chapter 3 to 
download waiting updates, both from Windows Update and the Windows 
Store.

273
 Chapter 14: Changing Settings
OneDrive
OneDrive, Microsoft’s cubbyhole in the clouds formerly called SkyDrive, 
plays a big role in your Surface. It’s built into Windows 8.1 and lives in every 
desktop folder, letting you shuttle files to and from the cloud.
Here’s where you control how much of your information automatically flows 
off your Surface and onto OneDrive.
	
✓	File Storage: This lets you buy more room on OneDrive should you use 
up your allotted 7GB. (New Surface owners should sign up for their free 
200GB, as I describe in Chapter 3.)
	
	A confusing toggle switch here called Save Documents to OneDrive by 
Default doesn’t automatically save your files to OneDrive. Turning on 
that switch merely tells programs to list OneDrive as a recommended 
location. You can still choose a different location to keep your files on 
your Surface.
Changing your user account
You may want to change the account you use 
to log in on your Surface. For example, you 
may want to log in with the same account 
you use for your Xbox, or you may want to 
switch to a newly remembered Microsoft 
account.
The simplest solution is to create a new User 
Account for your new Microsoft account by fol­
lowing these steps:
	 1.	 Open the Settings charm and then tap 
Change PC Settings.
	 2.	 Tap the Accounts category, tap Other 
Accounts from the Accounts pane, and 
then tap the plus sign icon next to Add an 
Account.
	 3.	 Type the e-mail address associated with 
your newly remembered Windows Live 
ID (or the e-mail address associated with 
your Xbox gamer tag).
	 4.	 Log back in to your old account and then 
move all of your data to your new account.
	
	 You can do this with either OneDrive, a 
flash drive, or a portable hard drive. Copy 
the contents of your Documents, Music, 
Videos, and Pictures folders.
	 5.	 Log into your new account and copy your 
old files back into your new folders.
When you’re through, you can log out of your 
old account and log into your new account. 
After a few days, feel free to delete your old 
account when you’re sure you no longer 
need it. (Make sure you’ve elevated your new 
account to Administrator so you’re able to 
delete the old account.)
Deleting your old account also deletes anything 
you’ve purchased with it through the Microsoft 
Store, including apps, movies, songs, and other 
items.

274
Part IV: Work 
	
✓	Camera Roll: Normally, when you take pictures with your Surface, the 
Surface places a low-quality copy of every photo you take onto OneDrive. 
Visit here to stop that practice or to have a full-quality copy sent, instead. 
(You can even tell your Surface to upload a copy of videos shot, as well.)
	
✓	Sync Settings: Microsoft kindly remembers the settings of Microsoft 
account owners. Log into another PC with your Microsoft account, 
and your settings, passwords, app purchases, favorite websites, and 
more will ride along, making that other PC behave much like your 
own. Drop by here to weed out the settings you don’t want to travel 
with you.
	
✓	Metered Connections: Don’t bother with this unless you use your 
Surface with a cellular connection. This area lets you restrict when 
and why your ever-thirsty Surface can slurp data over those expen­
sive cellular Internet connections.
Search and Apps
The catch-all Search and Apps category for Start screen items lets you 
control the Charm bar’s Search and Share commands, as well as how 
apps behave on your Surface. Figure 14-3 shows the Notifications area of 
the Search and Apps category; all of the PC Settings categories look very 
similar.
Figure 14-3:

 Chapter 14: Changing Settings
	
✓	Search: Drop by here to delete your past Search History — the words 
that appear below the Charms bar’s Search box when you begin typing.
	
	The Charms bar’s Search box routes your searches to the Internet using 
Bing, Microsoft’s search engine, in an effort to grab related information. 
If you find that to be snooping, toggle off the Use Bing to Search Online 
button.
	
✓	Share: This rarely used setting lets you choose which apps appear on 
the Share pane’s list of destinations. (To see the Share pane, open the 
Charms bar and tap Share.)
	
✓	Notifications: When an app gets excited, it often sends you a notification: a 
little box in your screen’s top-right corner, accompanied by a beep sound. 
You may see notifications of a new instant message, for example, or an 
upcoming appointment. This section, shown earlier in Figure 14-3, lets you 
turn off all notifications and their announcement sounds. For a less heavy-
handed approach, scroll down the screen to the Show Notifications from 
These Apps section. There, you can choose which specific apps may send 
notifications, quieting all the rest.
	
	If you value your sleep time, visit the Notifications area’s Quite Hours 
section to set your evening hours when you don’t want to be disturbed 
by notifications from night owls.
	
✓	App sizes: Should your Surface grow short on storage space, tap this to 
see a list of installed apps, sorted with the largest ones at the top. Delete 
the biggest hogs to regain some space. (Apps can’t be stored on your 
memory card, unfortunately.)
	
✓	Defaults: When the wrong program keeps opening your files, visit here. 
It lets you choose which program should handle your e-mail, music, 
video, photos, calendar, and other common chores.
Privacy
With computers, you must give up some information (your location, for 
example) to receive other information (localized weather reports and maps). 
The settings in this area let you choose your comfort level when it comes to 
how much information you want to give up.
The Privacy category merits an occasional visit to see whether anything has 
fallen out of your comfort zone.
	
✓	General: Microsoft tries to feed you ads you want to see. To do that, it 
watches the websites you visit and the terms you search for through 
the Search box. This area lets you adjust what information you want to 
share with other apps, as well as with Microsoft.
www.it-ebooks.info

276
Part IV: Work 
	
✓	Location: When first loaded, some apps — the Map app, for example — ask 
permission to access your general geographic location. This area lets you 
change which apps should have that permission.
	
✓	Webcam: Think an app might be spying on you through your Surface’s 
camera? As a first step, visit here to see which apps have permission to 
use the camera.
	
✓	Microphone: This area shows which apps may listen to you through 
your microphone.
	
✓	Other devices: If you install another device that may spy on you, it 
appears here.
Network
Because your Surface moves around with you a lot, it has a chance to connect 
with a wide variety of networks. The Network category lets you control how 
your Surface may connect with them.
	
	
✓	Connections: This lists your currently connected Wi-Fi network. (When 
troubleshooting, tap the icon to see details like an IP address, security 
protocol and type, network adapter manufacturer, and driver version.)
	
	If you use your Surface to connect with a corporate network, the big 
deal is being able to set up a VPN (virtual private network) by filling out a 
short form.
	
✓	Airplane Mode: Enter here to turn on Airplane mode. (You can turn on 
Airplane mode more quickly from the bottom of the Settings pane, as I 
describe in Chapter 4.)
	
	Visiting the Airplane mode setting here offers two perks: You can stay in 
Airplane mode but turn back on your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. That way you 
can take advantage of the plane’s Wi-Fi service, if available, and keep 
using your Bluetooth mouse.
	
✓	Proxy: Used mostly by techies, this lets you set up an alternative server, 
usually to handle your web requests.
	
✓	Homegroup: If you’ve set up a homegroup — a special type of network — 
on your home or office computers, visit here to join or leave it. There’s 
one caveat: The Surface RT and Surface 2 can’t start a homegroup, but 
they can join an existing one. The Surface Pro and Pro 2, by contrast, can 
both start and join an existing homegroup.
	
✓	Workplace: If you work at a “Bring Your Own Device” company, here’s 
where you type the user ID that your company handed to you.

Time and Language
Frequented mostly by bilinguals, translators, and globe trotters, the Time and

rectly — even during Daylight Saving Time — visit here to turn on the 
Set Time Automatically toggle.
	
	While here, you can also change the date and time formats to match 
your current region, as well as change your time zone.
	
✓	Region and Language: Bilingual Surface owners tap this to add keyboard 
layouts used in other countries. (That lets them type foreign symbols not 
found on the usual keyboard.)
Ease of Access
These switches in the Ease of Access category help adapt the Surface to 
people with physical challenges. The High Contrast switch, for example, 
helps the vision-impaired by reducing all distraction. And the Narrator, a 
Windows chestnut for years, reads menus and text with its robotic tone.
Update and Recovery
Tossed in at the bottom of the PC Settings section is the Update and Recovery 
category. These three sections found there make or break your Surface:
	
✓	Windows Update: Microsoft regularly issues updates for your Surface to 
fix problems and smooth out rough spots. Tap the Check Updates link here 
to find, download, and install the latest updates. For more information 
about Windows Update, flip back to Chapter 3.
	
✓	File History: Drop by here to turn on Microsoft’s backup program. File 
History can backup files to a portable hard drive or a network location, 
as I describe in Chapter 15. (It also backs up to a memory card in your 
Surface’s memory card slot, but if you lose your Surface, you’ve also lost 
your backup.)
	
✓	Recovery: I cover this section’s last three options, Refresh, Remove 
Everything, and Advanced Startup, in Chapter 15. They’re powerful tools 
to cure ailing Surfaces.

E

ven the best-treated Surface occasionally falls ill. This chapter covers 
general-purpose cures, as well as a few tweaks to solve specific 
problems.
The Surface doesn’t contain any user-serviceable parts, so don’t bother 
reaching for a screwdriver (or even finding any screws on the darn thing).
Instead, this chapter offers different ways to cure your Surface’s software 
problems: how to turn it on when it refuses and how to turn it off when it 
stops listening to you.
I explain how to refresh your Surface when it’s really misbehaving. And I 
show how to reset your Surface to factory condition when you’re ready to 
start over from scratch.
In case nothing seems to fix it, the last section explains how to contact 
Microsoft for repairing or replacing your Surface.
Checking for New or Missed Updates
Your Surface is a comparatively new product for Microsoft, so Microsoft 
­constantly releases a stream of patches to fix nagging problems and hopefully 
prevent new ones from occurring.
www.it-ebooks.info

280
Part IV: Work 
The Surface RT and Surface 2 automatically install every new update; the 
Windows Update service can’t be turned off. However, your Surface often 
waits a day or two before installing new patches so the updates won’t 
­interfere with your work.
If you’re planning a trip or you’ll be away from the Internet, you can force 
your Surface to install new updates by following these steps:
	
1.	Fetch the Charms bar by sliding your finger inward from the screen’s 
right edge. Then tap the Settings icon.
	
2.	Tap Change PC Settings at the bottom of the Settings pane, tap the 
Update and Recovery category, and then tap Windows Update.
	
3.	Tap the Check Now button.
	
	 Shown in Figure 15-1, the Check Now button tells your Surface to connect 
to the Internet and look for any recently released updates from Microsoft.
	
4.	If updates are available, tap or click the View Details link.
	
5.	Tap to select the updates you want to install and then tap the Install 
button.
	
	 Your Surface immediately installs the waiting updates.
	
✓	Depending on the update, you may need to restart your Surface after 
Windows Update finishes installing the patches.
	
✓	If you spot a waiting update labelled Firmware, plug your Surface into its 
power charger before installing it. Firmware patches are more extensive 
than other patches. They take longer to install, and you don’t want your 
Surface to run out of power before they’re completely installed.
	
✓	To view your history of installed updates, which is handy when trouble­
shooting, tap the View Your Update History in Step 3. Windows displays 
a list of downloaded updates, and the word Installed or Failed appears 
next to each one. Your Surface automatically tries to reinstall failed 
updates the next time it connects with Windows Update.
	
✓	Your Surface RT and Surface Pro must have all updates installed before 
the Upgrade to Windows 8.1 link appears in the Windows Store. If you 
can’t upgrade to Windows 8.1, keep vising Windows Update until you’ve 
installed all the waiting updates.
	
✓	Windows Update is always turned on and set to automatic on the 
Surface RT and Surface 2. On the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2, make 
sure it’s set the same way by tapping the Choose How Updates Get 
Installed link in Step 3. Then choose Install Updates Automatically 
(Recommended) from the Important Updates drop-down menu, and tap 
the Apply button.

 Chapter 15: Troubleshooting and Repair
It Won’t Turn On!
When your Surface won’t even turn on, it’s not always an End-of-Tablet-Life 
situation. No, it usually means the battery needs charging. Grab your Surface’s 
battery charger and begin running down these steps:
	
1.	Unplug everything from your Surface: USB gadgets, memory cards, 
keyboards, docking stations, and anything else connected to your 
Surface.
	
	 You want to isolate your Surface completely and rule out any third-party 
culprits that may be interfering.
	
	 Like most chargers, your Surface’s charger may not work when the 
­temperature drops below freezing.
	
2.	Plug the charger into the wall outlet and plug its other end into your 
Surface’s power connector.
	
	 I show how to plug in the charger in Chapter 2. When your Surface is charg­
ing correctly, you’ll spot a glowing dot of light either at the ­charger’s tip 
(shown earlier in Chapter 2) or near the tip’s end.
	
	 If you spot the light, press and release your Surface’s power switch. If it 
turns on, you’re through. Let your Surface charge for a few hours and try 
to remember to plug it in more often.
Figure 15-1:

Check Now 
button to 
look for new 
updates.

282
Part IV: Work 
	
	 If you don’t spot the glowing charger light, plug the charger into a 
­different wall outlet.
	
	 If the charger light glows, your first wall outlet is bad. Leave your 
Surface plugged in to slurp up electricity.
	
	 Still no glowing charger light? Move to Step 3.
	
3.	Clean the connectors.
	
	 The power supply’s connector tip can’t connect with the Surface’s 
­charging port if one of them is dirty or covered with oil. Unplug the 
power cord from the wall outlet. Then put some rubbing alcohol on a 
rag and wipe off the magnets on both the charger’s connector and the 
Surface’s charging port. When it’s dry, plug in the charger and try to 
charge your Surface one last time.
If the charging light still won’t turn on when connected between the wall 
outlet and your Surface, it probably needs replacing. Contact the Surface 
Online Service Center (http://myservice.surface.com) for help. 
I describe the process at this chapter’s end.
	
	
✓	If your Surface has a tiny amount of charge left, only the Battery Is 
Critically Low icon appears. That’s a sure sign you need to charge your 
Surface as soon as possible.
	
	
✓	If your Surface is too hot to turn on, perhaps from being left on a car’s 
dashboard, the Surface Is Too Hot icon may appear. Remove your 
Surface from the heat and let it cool off completely before trying to 
turn it on.
Turning on a stubborn Surface Pro or Pro 2
If your Surface Pro or Pro 2 receives power 
from the charger but still won’t turn on, it might 
be stuck in a rare limbo state where it’s neither 
completely on nor off. Before giving up, try this 
resuscitative effort to ensure that the Surface 
turns off completely:
Note: This trick doesn’t work on the Surface RT 
or Surface 2.
	 1.	 Hold down the Volume Up switch and 
simultaneously hold down the power 
button for at least 15 seconds.
	
	 The Surface may flash a Surface logo, but 
keep holding down the buttons, counting 
slowly to 15. You want to make sure your 
Surface turns off completely.
	 2.	 Let go of both buttons and wait ten seconds.
	 3.	 Press and release the power button.
Your Surface Pro or Pro 2 should turn back on 
and behave normally. If it still doesn’t turn on, 
it’s time to head for this chapter’s last section, 
“Servicing Your Surface through Microsoft.”
www.it-ebooks.info

283
 Chapter 15: Troubleshooting and Repair
It Won’t Turn Off!
When your Surface seems too deep in thought to listen to any of your frantic 
commands, try this trick:
Hold down the Surface’s power button for ten slow seconds. (Count them.) 
After ten seconds, the Surface stops what it’s doing and turns off.
Give it a moment to rest. Then press and release the power button. Your 
Surface should wake up, display the welcoming word Surface on the screen, 
and drop you off at your Sign In screen, once again eager for your attention.
Fixing Problem Apps
Sometimes apps don’t work correctly. They crash when you press a button, 
for example. Or they freeze on the screen. When an app doesn’t seem to be 
working correctly anymore, this trick usually works: Uninstall it and then 
reinstall it from the Windows Store.
This trick works for both free and paid apps; the Windows Store remembers 
your purchase and lets you download the app again without paying twice.
	
1.	From the Start screen, select your problem app’s tile or icon.
	
	 To select an app, hold your finger down on it. After a second or two, 
a check mark appears by the app, and the App bar appears along the 
screen’s bottom edge.
	
2.	Tap the Uninstall icon on the App bar.
	
	
	 Your Surface uninstalls the app.
	
3.	Visit the Windows Store and reinstall the app.
	
	 From the Windows Store, slide your down finger slightly from the 
screen’s top and then tap the words Your Apps that appear at the top.
	
	
	 When the list of all of your apps appears, slide your finger down slightly 
on the icon of your formerly misbehaving app. When the App bar appears 
along the screen’s bottom edge, tap the Install icon.
Your app reinstalls itself onto your Start screen’s All Apps area. With any 
luck, your app has enjoyed its vacation and returned in a better mood.
	
	
✓	To pin your app back to the Start screen, slide your finger upward from 
the middle of the Start screen. When the All Apps area comes into view, 
tap and hold your newly reinstalled app; when the App bar appears 
along the screen’s bottom, tap the Pin to Start icon.
www.it-ebooks.info

284
Part IV: Work 
	
✓	You can also uninstall and reinstall apps that came bundled with your 
Surface, such as the News, Finance, and Weather apps. The Mail, Calendar, 
and People apps are actually one app. Uninstalling one removes all three. 
To reinstall them, install the Store’s app called “Mail, Calendar, and People.”
	
✓	If an app still acts up, contact the app’s publisher: Drop by the app’s 
entry in the Windows Store and scroll to the Details section of the app’s 
description page. There, under the Learn More category, tap the support 
link. That takes you to the publisher’s website or opens an e-mail for you 
to use to contact the app’s publisher.
Backing Up Your Surface
Your Surface does a remarkable job of backing itself up. For example, your 
Microsoft account remembers how you personalize your Surface, as well as 
the settings you change. It also remembers your e-mail accounts, calendar 
information, contacts, favorite websites, and even many of your passwords.
Aided by your Microsoft account, the Windows Store remembers the apps 
you’ve installed and purchased, making it easy to download them again. Any 
files you store on OneDrive are backed up there.
So, what’s left to back up? Well, it’s the files stored in your Windows main 
folders: Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos. Your Surface’s built-in File 
History program can back those up, but there’s a catch: Microsoft didn’t turn 
on File History by default.
To turn on the File History backup program, you need to choose a backup 
location and tap the program’s On switch by following these steps:
	
1.	Insert your memory card into your Surface’s memory card slot, or 
plug a portable hard drive into your Surface’s USB port.
	
	 I describe how to do both in Chapter 6.
	
	 If you prefer to back up your Surface to a wireless network location 
(­perhaps a shared folder on another PC), you can do that in Step 3.
	
2.	Visit the PC Settings’ File History category.
	
	 Fetch the Charms bar by sliding your finger inward from the screen’s 
right edge and then tapping the Search pane’s Settings icon.
	
	
	 Type File History into the Search box and then tap the File History 
Settings link.
	
	 The File History settings page appears, as shown in Figure 15-2. File 
History quickly looks for any available drives and lists the most 
­promising candidate (the largest available drive). If you haven’t plugged 
any drives into your Surface’s USB port, File History recommends your 
memory card as a backup location.
www.it-ebooks.info

285
 Chapter 15: Troubleshooting and Repair
	
3.	Choose your backup drive and tap the Turn On toggle switch.
	
	 If you’re backing up to your memory card — and that’s the only ­available 
backup spot available — tap the Turn On toggle switch, and you’re through. 
Your Surface starts backing up your files on the memory card. File History 
refers to the memory card as “Removable Disk (D:).”
	
	 But if you want to back up to a different drive, tap the Select a Different 
Drive link. A pop-up menu appears, listing all the drives available to 
your Surface. Choose your drive’s name from the pop-up menu, tap File 
History’s On/Off toggle switch to On, and you’re done.
	
	 If you want to back up to a network location, tap the Select a Different 
Drive link. When the pop-up menu appears, choose Show All Network 
Locations at the bottom of the pop-up menu. When your list of network 
locations appears, tap the one you want and tap the program’s On/Off 
toggle switch to On. Whew!
After you’ve chosen the backup location and turned on File History, your 
Surface backs up your files every hour.
	
✓	If you’re using a portable drive, store it in a safe, yet convenient, place. 
You must remember to reconnect it often so your Surface can create 
another, more-recent backup.
	
✓	To view your backups, open the Desktop app, tap the Charms bar’s 
Settings icon, and tap Control Panel from the top of the Settings pane. 
When the Control Panel appears, open the System and Security section 
and tap File History.

Part IV: Work 
Refreshing Your Surface
When your Surface isn’t working correctly, you can tell it to reinstall its 
­operating system but leave your files on your tablet. Refreshing your Surface 
is a quick fix because you can easily reinstall your apps from the Windows 
Store. But it poses a problem for owners of the Surface Pro and Pro 2.
	
On the Surface Pro and Pro 2 models, the Refresh feature also removes all of 
the programs you’ve installed on your Desktop app. Before using the Refresh 
feature, make sure you have your program’s original installation files handy 
because you need to reinstall them all.
Bringing your data back to a new or 
factory-reset Surface
Whether you’ve bought a replacement Surface 
or done a factory reset on your existing Surface, 
here’s how to bring all of your files, settings, 
and apps back to your Surface. Your Surface is 
designed to be used with a Microsoft account, 
so if you don’t have one, some of these steps 
won’t work.
	 1.	 Turn on your Surface and sign in with your 
Microsoft account.
	
	 I describe the steps you should take when 
first turning on a new Surface in Chapter 3. 
For example, be sure to visit Windows 
Update and install all of the waiting updates.
	 2.	 Tell your PC to sync your settings.
	
	 Fetch the Charms bar, tap Settings, and tap 
OneDrive on the PC Settings screen. From 
the OneDrive pane, tap Sync Settings and 
then tap Sync Your Settings on This PC.
	
	 When given a choice of which PC to grab 
the settings from, choose your old Surface 
from the list.
	 3.	 Visit the Windows Store and reinstall your 
apps.
	
	 From the Windows Store, slide your finger 
down slightly from the screen’s top and 
then tap the Your Apps button that appears 
along the screen’s top edge. From the first 
drop-down menu, choose your old Surface’s 
name. Then tap the Select All icon from the 
App bar and tap the adjacent Install icon.
	
	 Or, if you spot icons for your uninstalled 
apps on the Start screen, tap their icons 
to begin downloading them anew. (On the 
Start screen, icons for uninstalled apps 
have a little downward-pointing arrow in 
their lower-right corner.)
	 4.	 Restore your files from File History.
	
	 If necessary, plug in the drive ­containing 
your File History backup or insert the 
memory card. Then fetch the Charms bar, 
tap Search, and in the Search box type 
Restore File. From the Search pane, tap the 
Restore Your Files With File History link to 
fetch the File History program. When the 
program window appears, tap the green 
button in the window’s bottom center to 
copy your files back in place.

 Chapter 15: Troubleshooting and Repair
To refresh your Surface, follow these steps:
	
1.	Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap Settings, and then tap 
Change PC settings.
	
2.	Tap the General section.
	
3.	In the Refresh Your PC Without Affecting Your Files section, tap the 
Get Started button.
	
	 Your Surface will restart.
	
4.	When your Surface wakes up, you’re left with a few tasks:
 
• Visit the PC Settings screen’s Windows Update section and down­
load any waiting updates.
 
• Open the Windows Store app and reinstall your apps.
 
• On the Surface Pro or Pro 2, open the Windows desktop. There, 
you find a waiting list of your uninstalled desktop programs, along 
with links to where you can download and reinstall them. If you 
don’t find links to missing programs, you need to reinstall the 
­programs from their original discs.
	
Refreshing your Surface RT or Surface 2 takes less time than refreshing a 
Surface Pro or Surface 2 Pro because you needn’t worry about reinstalling 
desktop programs. (The Office programs will still be there, although you need 
to update them again with Windows Update.)
On a well-used Surface Pro or Surface Pro 2, by contrast, tracking down and 
reinstalling all those desktop programs can be a nightmare.
Resetting Your Surface
This last-resort option wipes your Surface completely clean, removing every­
thing. When it wakes back up, your Surface behaves like it was just removed 
from its shiny new box. Although it’s a drastic measure, this last-ditch effort 
can often salvage a Surface that seems beyond repair.
Resetting your Surface is also a good way to restore your Surface to factory 
conditions before giving it away, either to friends or charity.
	
Resetting your Surface deletes all of your personal files, apps, desktop 
­programs, and settings.
www.it-ebooks.info

288
Part IV: Work 
To reset your Surface to factory conditions, follow these steps:
	
1.	Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap Settings, and then tap 
Change PC settings.
	
2.	Tap the General category.
	
3.	In the section called Remove Everything and Reinstall Windows, tap 
Get Started, tap Next, and follow the instructions.
If you’re giving away your Surface, choose the Fully Clean My Drive option. 
That option takes much longer, but it scrubs your drive clean of any 
identifying information.
When your Surface returns to life, flip back to Chapter 3. Your Surface 
behaves just as it did when you first turned it on, and you need to choose a 
language and begin installing updates.
I can’t even sign in!
If your Surface seems beyond repair, you’re not 
without hope. You can troubleshoot, refresh, 
or reset your Surface to factory conditions by 
­following these steps:
	 1.	 With your Surface turned off, attach any 
type of keyboard.
	
	 A desktop keyboard plugged into your USB 
port will do if you don’t have a Touch or 
Type Cover keyboard cover.
	 2.	 Turn on your Surface by pressing its power 
button.
	 3.	 At the Sign In screen, press and hold the 
left Shift key.
	 4.	 Tap the Power icon in the screen’s bottom-
right corner and then choose Restart from 
the pop-up menu.
	
	 A light-blue screen appears on your 
Surface, offering several options, including 
Troubleshoot.
	 5.	 Tap Troubleshoot.
	
	 The Troubleshoot screen lets you refresh 
or reset your Surface, options described in 
their own sections in this chapter. But before 
trying those, tap Advanced Options and then 
tap Automatic Repair.
If your Surface can’t repair itself, follow these 
steps again but choose Refresh or Repair in Step 5.
In Step 5, owners of the Surface RT and Surface 
2 find a way to boot from their USB Recovery 
Drive, which I describe how to make in Chapter 3. 
Surface Pro or Surface Pro 2 owners see an 
option to load a System Image backup.

Servicing Your Surface through Microsoft
If your Surface includes problems you can’t fix alone, drop by Microsoft’s 
website at this address:
https://myservice.surface.com
After you enter your Microsoft account, the website walks you through 
­registering your Surface, reporting problems, checking the status of service 
orders, checking your warranty status, replacing accessories, and, if desired, 
buying a service plan.
	
To find your Surface’s serial number, flip open its kickstand; the serial number 
is printed below the word Surface. The serial number for your Touch or Type 
Cover keyboards is printed in extraordinarily tiny letters on the right side of the 
keyboard’s spine. (You need to detach the keyboard from your Surface to see it.)
When your new or refurbished Surface returns from the repair shop, fill it 
back up with your files and settings by following the steps in this chapter’s

A

 For Dummies book wouldn’t be the same without a Part of Tens section: 
ten tidbits of information that didn’t quite fit anywhere else in the book.
With the Surface, the hard part is limiting this chapter to only ten tips. After 
paring down the list from 20, here are 10 essential tips ’n’ tricks to wring the 
most out of your Surface.
When Lost, Swipe in from 
the Screen’s Left Edge
Whenever you tap a link or open another program on your Surface, the new 
item fills the screen, pulling you in deeply. When you finally close the app, the 
Start screen jumps in to fill the void.
But what were you working on before you went off track by tapping the link?
To find out, slide in your finger from the screen’s left side. Your finger pulls 
your original app back onto the screen, bringing you full circle to where you 
were before the distraction.
www.it-ebooks.info

294
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Search for Items by Typing Directly 
on the Start Screen
If you’ve attached any type of keyboard to your Surface, you have a special 
perk: To search for something, begin typing its name directly onto the Start 
screen. Windows automatically fetches the Charms bar, enters your search 
into the Search box, and begins listing matches.
For example, type camera directly into the Start screen.
As you type the first letter, the Start screen switches to Search mode; as the 
letter c enters the Search box, the Search pane lists every app, setting, or file 
containing the letter c. The list narrows as you keep typing, eventually show­
ing only camera-related apps and settings, followed by popular camera-related 
­listings on the Internet, as shown in Figure 16-1.
Figure 16-1: 
Typing 
the word 
camera 
directly into 
the Start 
screen 
fetches 
the Search 
box and 
lists match-
ing apps, 
settings, 
files, and 
websites.
Don’t have a keyboard attached to your Surface? You can do the same thing 
by tapping the Search icon in the Start screen’s upper-right corner. When 
the Search pane’s Search box appears, tap inside the Search box to call up 
the onscreen keyboard. Then start typing your search term. That takes a few 
more keystrokes but works the same way.

 Chapter 16: Ten Essential Tips ’n’ Tricks
Select Onscreen Items within Apps
Some items seem difficult to select, which is a precursor to deleting, moving, 
renaming, copying, or any other host of tasks. For example, a tap on an e-mail 
in the Mail app opens rather than selects the e-mail. Holding down a finger on 
the e-mail won’t select it, and perplexed finger jabs just scroll the item back 
and forth.
The trick to selecting difficult items is to slide your finger across them in the 
opposite direction that they scroll.
Mail normally lets you scroll through e-mail by sliding your finger up or down 
the list. So, select a single piece of e-mail by sliding your finger left or right 
across it. This “slide in the opposite direction” trick works when selecting 
many other seemingly difficult-to-select items.
Take Screenshots
To take a snapshot of what you’re seeing on the screen, hold down the 
Windows key below your Surface’s screen and press the Volume Down 
button. The screen dims, and a screenshot appears in your Pictures library’s 
Screenshots folder.
	
Taking screenshots comes in particularly handy when an error message pops 
up. You can e-mail the screenshot to a techie who can tell you how to deal 
with the error.
Stop the Screen from Rotating
Most of the time, you want the screen to rotate as you hold your Surface. 
That way, the screen is always right side up. Occasionally, though, you don’t 
want it to rotate — perhaps you’re reading a book or browsing websites.
	
	 To keep the screen from rotating, open the Charms bar and tap on Settings. 
When the Settings pane appears, tap on the Screen icon near the bottom 
right (shown in the margin).
When the brightness bar appears, look at the Rotation Lock icon atop the 
bar; tap that icon to toggle autorotation on and off.
www.it-ebooks.info

296
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Note: The rotation lock automatically turns on when your Touch or Type 
Cover keyboard is attached and folded out for use. The lock turns off when 
you fold back the keyboard (or detach it) to use your Surface as a tablet.
Tweak Your App’s Settings
	
	 Every app offers a way to fine-tune its behavior through the Charms bar’s 
Settings area. When something about an app irks you, see whether you can 
change it: Fetch the Charms bar by sliding your finger in from the screen’s 
right edge and tapping the Settings icon. If an app can be changed, the 
Settings pane offers a way.
Make a Recovery Drive
I tossed this in as a sidebar in Chapter 3, but creating a Recovery Drive isn’t 
very difficult. If you have a flash drive, dedicate it as a Recovery Drive for 
your Surface. If your Surface won’t start someday, that Recovery Drive just 
might be the only thing to bring it back to life.
The Surface RT and Surface 2 need a USB drive of at least 4GB; the Surface 
Pro and Pro 2 models need a USB drive of at least 8GB.
Find a Lost Start Screen App
Can’t find an app on your Start screen? Then check the All Apps area; from the 
Start screen, slide your screen upward until the All Apps area appears. Look for 
your app in the alphabetical list. When you spot it, launch it with a tap.
	
	 Or, if you want it on the Start screen, where it’s easier to launch, hold your 
finger down on its icon. When the App bar appears along the bottom, choose 
Pin to Start.
	
	 Don’t see Pin to Start? Then tap the App bar’s Find on Start icon instead. The 
Start screen returns with the formerly missing app’s tile highlighted with a 
white border.
If you still can’t find the app, head to the Windows Store. You may need to 
reinstall it.

 Chapter 16: Ten Essential Tips ’n’ Tricks
Increase Your Surface’s Storage Space
The biggest challenge when moving from a desktop PC to a Surface is the 
amount of storage space. Most Surfaces offer from 32GB to 128GB of storage; 
the Surface Pro 2 offers up to 512GB. Yet, most desktop PCs still offer much 
more storage than that.
Also, Windows consumes quite a bit of that space. On a 32GB Surface 2, 
you’re left with only 18GB of space to store your own files.
	
The easiest, fastest, and best way to maximize storage on your Surface is to 
insert a microSDXC memory card into its memory slot. You can buy cards with 
up to 64GB of space and store your files there. Turn to Chapter 6 if you’re not 
sure how to insert or access your memory card.
Don’t have a memory card? Then follow these steps to delete any unneeded 
files, leaving more room for storage on your Surface:
	
1.	Run the desktop’s Disk Cleanup program.
	
	 Type free up disk space into the Charms bar’s Search box. Then tap the 
similarly named link that appears beneath the box. The Disk Cleanup 
program appears, as shown in Figure 16-2.
	
Figure 16-2: 
Tap the 
check boxes 
next to the 
categories 
you want to 
delete and 
then tap the 
OK button to 
delete them.
	
	
2.	Tap the Clean Up System Files button near the window’s bottom.
	
	 That tells the program to also list files created by Windows itself rather 
than you. You can safely delete most of them.

3.	Select the boxes next to the items you want to delete.
	
	 If you’ve refreshed your Surface, you may spot a category named 
Temporary Windows Installation Files. Select that one, and you free up 
several gigabytes of space.
	
4.	Tap the OK button to delete the files.
	
	 When you delete the files, they’re gone for good. Unlike most desktop 
files, you can’t retrieve them. If you’re in doubt about deleting an item, 
don’t select its check box.
If you still need more disk space, consider carrying around a portable hard 
drive, which can store 3TB or more.
Add Your Contact Information 
to Your Surface
If you lose your Surface, your information usually remains safe. If you’ve 
chosen a secure password for your Microsoft account, nobody can move past 
the Lock screen.
But if a Good Samaritan finds your Surface, how will the finder know how to 
return it to you? You can solve that problem in either of two different ways.
	
For a quick-and-easy solution, grab a permanent magic marker and write your 
name and phone number on the back of your Surface. Use large letters on the 
back or write with a fine-point marker along the top of your Surface. (To keep 
your personal information less visible, write it beneath the kickstand.) That 
not only ensures that the finder will see your contact information, but it will 
raise suspicions at the pawn shop.
If you want to preserve your Surface’s resale value, though, there’s another way:
	
Use the desktop’s Paint program or another graphics editor to write your 
name and phone number onto the wallpaper you use for your Lock screen. 
That makes it easy to update if your phone number changes.
Then whoever finds your Surface will see your contact information every 
time your Surface turns on.

“M

y Surface would be perfect if only . . . ” Have you ever thought that 
to yourself?
This chapter tackles accessories that smooth out the spots that keep your 
Surface from being your favorite computer.
Whether you never leave the desk or you travel the globe, these accessories 
turn your Surface into a faithful digital assistant.
Power Adapter
Your Surface came with a power adapter, so it isn’t really an accessory. But if 
you’re traveling with your Surface, it’s essential that you tote this along.
	
Just like an iPad, your Surface can’t be charged through its USB port.
www.it-ebooks.info

Part V: The Part of Tens 
The adapter that came bundled with your Surface works the best. However, 
any Surface charger works with any Surface. Just remember that chargers for 
the Surface RT and Surface 2 take much longer to charge than a Surface Pro 
or Surface Pro 2.
Touch or Type Cover Keyboard
Your Surface’s onscreen keyboard works fine for typing snippets of text on 
the Start screen and its gang of apps. But when you’re creating some serious 
work on the desktop, the onscreen keyboard falls short.
First, it covers half of your screen space, leaving little room for your desk­
top or app. Second, the onscreen keyboard isn’t designed for speedy 
touch-typing.
Your Surface generously offers you several options, but the most versatile 
replacement is either a Touch or Type Cover keyboard. Custom-made for the 
Surface, the keyboard snaps into place, as shown in Figure 17-1, and folds 
down for typing. When you’re done typing, the keyboard folds up to double 
as a screen protector.

Lightweight and durable, either keyboard is a natural fit for your Surface. I 
prefer the Touch Cover for casual use and the Type Cover when typing for 
longer periods of time.
The newer Touch Cover 2 and Type Cover 2 keyboards work better than the 
original models, but all of the Touch and Type Cover keyboards still work on 
all Surfaces.
www.it-ebooks.info

301
 Chapter 17: Ten Handy Accessories
Any Bluetooth keyboard also works with your Surface, including the Microsoft 
Wedge Mobile Keyboard. Portable Bluetooth keyboards are rarely bigger or 
better than the Touch or Type Cover keyboards, however.
	
Don’t forget: If you’re holing up in the desert to write the Great American 
Novel, take your full-size desktop keyboard with you. Plug it into your 
Surface’s desktop-sized USB port, and your portable Surface will feel as com­
fortable as your staid desktop PC.
Memory Card
If you own a large music or video collection, a memory card is essential. A 
64GB microSDXC memory card, costing less than $50, can store thousands of 
songs or photos, and dozens of movies.
If your Surface leaves you cramped for space, by all means, buy a memory 
card and slip it into your Surface’s memory card slot. Your Surface should 
recognize it immediately. It’s one of the cheapest and easiest updates.
I describe how to buy and insert a memory card into your Surface in Chapter 6.
Portable Mouse
The trackpads built into the Touch and Type Cover keyboards work fine for 
small jobs. For example, a few nudges of the trackpad let you maneuver the 
cursor to the right spot to start, pause, or stop music and movies. And on the 
desktop, a trackpad works much better than your fingertip.
But I’ve always found trackpads to be cumbersome compared with a real 
mouse. When I’m ready for serious computing work, I want a real mouse. 
Thankfully, the Surface offers several options.
If space isn’t a concern, just toss your favorite desktop mouse into your bag. 
Plug the mouse into your Surface’s USB port, and you’re set.
If space rules supreme in your gadget bag, though, look for something more 
portable. I’ve tried both Microsoft’s Arc Touch mouse and Wedge Touch 
mouse, and both work very well.
Being a minimalist at heart, I prefer the Wedge Touch mouse, shown in 
Figure 17-2. Granted, it’s miniscule, but it’s convenient and responsive. It’s 
easily detected by your Surface; if you have more than one Surface, it’s not 
hard to switch it from one to another.

trackpad.

Powered by a single (and easily replaced) AA battery, the mouse turns on and 
off automatically, making its battery last for up to four months.
Microsoft released Surface-branded versions of the Wedge and Arc mice. The 
new Surface Wedge Touch mouse simply has black sides rather than chrome, 
so there’s little gain there.
The Surface Arc Touch mouse, though, brings an improvement: It works 
directly with Bluetooth, and you no longer need to tote around the Arc Touch 
mouse’s little Bluetooth nub that consumed the USB port.
Portable USB Hub
Your Surface’s built-in, full-size USB port gives it a burst of utility unmatched 
by all other tablets, including those from Apple and Android.
The only problem is that there’s only one. If you plug in a mouse, for example, 
there’s no room to plug in the flash drive, keyboard, mouse, cell phone, fax 
modem adapter, or any other USB accessories.
The solution is a portable USB hub. Small and inexpensive, the hub is a tiny 
box that plugs into your lone USB port. In exchange, the box contains four or 
more USB ports for plugging in other gadgets.
	
If you’re using a Surface RT or you’re not particularly concerned with transfer­
ring files at high speeds, pick up an inexpensive USB 2.0 hub. If you’ll be trans­
ferring large files through the hub, buy a slightly more expensive USB 3.0 hub.
You don’t need a powered hub — a hub that needs to plug into a power 
outlet — unless you plan to run on plugging in particularly power-hungry 
accessories, such as portable DVD players, cell phones that need charging, or 
more than one portable hard drive.

303
 Chapter 17: Ten Handy Accessories
Case
If you’re fine with your Surface and its click-on keyboard, you don’t need a 
case. Being both lightweight and flat, your Surface and keyboard combo fits 
easily into a suitcase.
But if you plan on taking a few accessories, perhaps a mouse, USB hub, por­
table hard drive, and a few cables, you probably want a case.
It’s not hard to find a case that fits your Surface, though, because it fits into 
nearly any case sold for laptops. Your Surface is thinner than nearly all lap­
tops, so don’t worry about the thickness as much as the other dimensions.
When shopping for a case, make sure its dimensions are at least 11 inches by 
7 inches. A case that size will fit any Surface model. Choose your case’s thick­
ness and amount of pockets to match the amount of accessories you plan to 
carry around.
Flash Drive
Many people find it difficult to live with the Surface’s small storage space; 
others have no problem: It’s simply a tablet to use on the road for e-mail and 
web access.
But if you need just a little bit more storage, a flash drive fits the bill. A flash 
drive, like the one shown in Figure 17-3, is like a miniature hard drive that 
plugs into your Surface’s USB port. Because it’s detachable, it’s an easy way 
to transfer files between your Surface and other computers.

drive plugs

A 32GB portable flash drive should handle most needs, but they’re available 
in sizes up to 256GB.

Portable HDMI Cable
Compared with the screen of a smartphone, your Surface’s 10-inch screen 
looks gigantic. Still, it doesn’t present the cinematic experience of a large 
high-definition TV set.
To watch your Surface’s movies on your HDTV, pick up a portable HDMI 
cable, shown in Figure 17-4. By connecting the cable between your Surface 
and your TV, everything you see on your Surface can fill the room with HDTV 
glory.
	
Figure 17-4: 
An HDMI 
cable 
lets you 
plug your 
Surface into 
an HDMI 
TV set, 
monitor, or 
some digital 
projectors.

Even if the concept seems silly at home, toting around a small cable can be 
cheaper than dishing out $15 for a hotel room’s pay-per-view movie. Just 
unplug the HDMI cable from the TV’s HDMI port. Then connect your own 
HDMI cable between the TV’s HDMI port and your Surface and watch a movie 
from your Surface. You send the movie from the Surface’s Video app, Netflix, 
or something streamed through Internet Explorer.
	
When shopping for an HDMI cable for a Surface RT or Surface 2, buy a micro-
HDMI-to-HDMI cable. (The cable’s male micro-HDMI side fits into your Surface; 
the male plug on the HDMI cable’s other side plugs into the TV set.)
	
For a Surface Pro or Surface Pro 2, buy a Mini DisplayPort-to-HDMI cable. (The 
cable’s male Mini DisplayPort plugs into your Surface; the male HDMI port 
plugs into the TV set.)
Even if you never plan to connect your Surface to a TV, these cables also 
work for connecting your Surface to an external monitor or some digital 
projectors.

 Chapter 17: Ten Handy Accessories
USB-to-Ethernet Adapter
An Internet connection ranks high on the essentials list for every Surface owner. 
Many people work fine with their Surface’s built-in wireless Internet connection.
However, wired Internet access — piped in through an Ethernet cable — comes 
in handy for several reasons.
	
✓	Security: Some businesses don’t offer wireless Internet access for secu­
rity reasons, leaving only wired access.
	
✓	Hotels without Wi-Fi: Some hotels still don’t offer Wi-Fi. But nearly every 
hotel has an Ethernet jack that offers wired Internet access.
	
✓	Reliability: Although Wi-Fi strength constantly changes, wired Internet 
access remains constant and fast, an important fact for people who 
watch streaming Internet videos.
If you can relate to any of these categories, just about any USB-to-Ethernet 
adapter works on the Surface Pro or Surface Pro 2. Some adapters also work 
on the Surface RT and Surface 2 if you’re willing to jump through an ever-
changing number of hoops to make it work.
Portable Hard Drive
People who need this usually know who they are. They want to carry every­
thing with them: all of their movies, photos, books, and songs.
If you want all of your materials around you for access any time, you need a 
portable hard drive.
People who shoot high-definition video and need to backup or process their 
footage on a Surface Pro or Pro 2 definitely want one of these.
	
Look for a USB 3.0 drive to take advantage of the USB 3.0 speeds of your 
Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2. That extra speed makes all the difference when 
moving large files.
Portable Car Charger
When traveling with a Surface, a portable car charger brings some extra 
peace of mind. Slipped into the glove box, it’s there in case you ever forget to 
pack your Surface’s plug-in charger.
www.it-ebooks.info

Part V: The Part of Tens 
The car charger is essential if you’re using your Surface on the road for work 
and can’t deal with any down time. Microsoft’s portable car charger, shown 
in Figure 17-5, can charge your Surface while you’re stuck in traffic, so you’re 
ready for work whenever you arrive.

simultaneously charge your phone.

About the Author
Andy Rathbone started geeking around with computers in 1985 when he 
bought a 26-pound portable CP/M Kaypro 2X. Like other nerds of the day, 
he soon began playing with null-modem adapters, dialing computer bulletin 
boards, and working at Radio Shack.
He wrote for various techie publications before moving to computer books in 
1992. He’s written the Windows For Dummies series, Upgrading and Fixing PCs 
For Dummies, Windows 8 For Tablets For Dummies, and many other computer 
books.
Today, he has more than 15 million copies of his books in print, and they’ve been 
translated into more than 30 languages. You can reach Andy at his website, www.
andyrathbone.com, where he answers a reader’s question online each week.
