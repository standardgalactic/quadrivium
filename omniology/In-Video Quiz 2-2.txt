Nervous system â€“ Membrane potentials
1. If a negatively charged ion is more concentrated inside of a cell, is the 
equilibrium potential for that ion positive or negative? (make a drawing if it 
helps)
 
A. positive
 
B. negative
2. In a cell, if the equilibrium potential for Na+ is +50 mV and the equilibrium 
potential for K+ is -50 mV, what is the membrane potential if the membrane is 
equally permeable to Na+ and K+?
 
A. +50 mV
 
B. +25 mV
 
C. 0 mV
 
D. -25 mV
 
E. -50 mV
Answer 1: A. positive
Answer 2: C. 0 mV
