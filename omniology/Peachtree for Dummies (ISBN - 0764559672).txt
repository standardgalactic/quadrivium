Introduction
You’re not a dummy, even if you think you are. But accounting by itself can
be a challenge — and then, when you add the computer part to it . . . well,
the whole thing can seem so overwhelming that you avoid it. (What? Never
crossed your mind?)
Okay, if you’re looking at this book, you’ve probably decided that you’ve
“avoided” it long enough, and now you’re going to do it — bite the bullet 
and computerize your accounting. We want to help you get the job done 
as quickly as possible with the least amount of pain. You’ve got other 
things to do, after all.
About This Book
Accounting isn’t exactly a fun subject — unless, of course, you’re an accoun-
tant . . . and even then it might not really be all that much fun. You might
think that going to the dentist is more fun than playing with accounting soft-
ware. We help you get past the ugly part so that you can start enjoying the
benefits quickly.
What benefits? Well, computerizing your accounting can save you time and
effort — and can actually be easier than doing it by hand and cheaper than
paying somebody else to do it. Oh, we don’t mean that you don’t need your
accountant, because you do. But you can save money by doing daily stuff for
yourself — and paying your accountant for advice on making your business
more profitable.
Peachtree For Dummies, 2nd Edition, shows you how to set up your company
in Peachtree and then use Peachtree to pay bills, invoice customers, pay
employees, produce reports about your financial picture, and more. But it’s
also a real-life-situation kind of book. We show you how to work in Peachtree
by using everyday, real-life situations as examples. You know, the stuff you
run into in the so-called real world that you need to figure out how to handle.
What You Can Safely Ignore
Throughout the book, we include Accounting Stuff tips — you can probably
ignore those unless you’re interested in that kind of stuff.

Oh, and the gray boxes that you see throughout the book? Those are called
sidebars, and they contain extra information that you really don’t have to
know but that we thought you might find useful and interesting. So feel free
to skip the sidebars as well.
Foolish Assumptions
We’ll be honest — we had to assume some things about you to write this
book. So, here’s what we assume about you:
 You already know a little something about the day-to-day stuff that you
need to do financially to run your business — you know, write checks,
bill customers, pay employees, and so on. We don’t assume that you
know how to do all that on a computer.
 You have a personal computer (that you know how to turn on) with
Microsoft Windows 98, Windows XP, or Windows 2000. We wrote this
book by using Windows XP.
 You bought Peachtree and installed it on your computer.
The Flavors of Peachtree
Peachtree comes in four versions: Peachtree First Accounting, Peachtree
Accounting, Peachtree Complete Accounting, and Peachtree Premium
Accounting. (Peachtree Premium is available in industry-specific versions
such as manufacturing, distribution, and accounting.) In this book, we cover
Peachtree Premium Accounting.
Peachtree Premium Accounting contains everything that you find in the other
three products plus a few additional features, such as the capability to store
three years’ worth of budget information instead of the two years available in
the other Peachtree products. Peachtree Premium and Peachtree Complete
include a time and billing feature that you don’t find in Peachtree First
Accounting or Peachtree Accounting, and Peachtree Premium and Peachtree
Complete are networkable as long as you make sure that you get the multiuser
version. Peachtree Premium and Peachtree Complete contain a job costing fea-
ture, but you find only a job tracking feature in Peachtree First Accounting and
Peachtree Accounting. (If you don’t know the difference between job costing
and job tracking, you probably don’t need either one.) And you can customize
reports and forms in Peachtree Premium Accounting, Peachtree Complete
Accounting, and Peachtree Accounting, but not Peachtree First Accounting.
2
Peachtree For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Throughout the book, when we cover a feature that you find in Premium but
not in the other flavors, we include notes to let you know. And, throughout
the book, when we refer to the product as Peachtree, we mean Peachtree
Premium — if we want to talk about one of the other flavors, we give you the
full product name.
How This Book Is Organized
Every great book needs a plan. We divided this book into four parts, each
made up of two to eight chapters so that you can easily find the information
that you need.
Part I: Getting Started
If you’re new to Peachtree, you probably want to read this part. We explain
how to get around in Peachtree, how to create a company in Peachtree, how
to make an effective chart of accounts, and how to set up default information
that saves you lots of time later.
Part II: The Daily Drudge
In this section, we cover the stuff that you do on a regular basis:
 Buy and pay for goods to sell to your customers (yep, we cover inven-
tory, too)
 Bill the customers and collect your money (or you won’t be able to pay
the employees)
 Pay the employees (or they won’t work!)
Stuff like that. We also cover paying for services that keep your business run-
ning, and we cover a couple of more esoteric topics, such as billing cus-
tomers for time that you spend working and tracking project costs.
Part III: The Fancy Stuff
In this section, we cover a variety of topics — most that you don’t do every
day. First, we show you how to customize forms and produce and modify
reports — after all, you put information into Peachtree, so you should be able
3
Introduction

to get it out and see the effects of your business habits. Then we cover recon-
ciling the bank statement and the stuff that you do monthly, quarterly, or
annually. We also show you how to easily keep your accounting information
safe — a very important chapter. Why? Because you spend so much time
putting stuff into Peachtree that it would be criminal to lose it just because
your hard drive crashes or your office is robbed.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
If you’ve ever read a For Dummies book before, you’ve seen the Part of Tens.
This part contains a collection of ten-something lists. Our Part of Tens
includes the following:
 Ten common error messages that you might see — and what they mean
 Ten things that you can get from the Web — not just Peachtree stuff like
support and additional information, but fun stuff, too, just in case you’ve
had a bad day and need a laugh
The Peachtree For Dummies Web Site
This book’s Web site, www.dummies.com/go/peachtreefd, features useful
information that’s not necessarily mainstream knowledge. You can find the
following Bonus Chapters:
 Bonus Chapter 1, in which you find out how to tailor Peachtree to sup-
port the way that you work.
 Bonus Chapter 2, in which we discuss how to use the Peachtree money
management tools to analyze your business and help you manage cash,
receivables, and payables.
 Bonus Chapter 3, in which we describe how to use Peachtree in a net-
work environment.
 Bonus Chapter 4, in which we list as many companion products for
Peachtree as we can find. These products can enhance the way that you
work in Peachtree.
 Bonus Chapter 5, in which we discuss who to blame for the whole
debit/credit thing and explain how debits and credits work.

Peachtree For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part I
Getting Started

In this part . . .
E
very project has a beginning point. If you are just get-
ting acquainted with Peachtree, this part is the place
to start. In this part, you find out how to navigate through
the Peachtree screens and how to set up your existing
company records in Peachtree.

Chapter 1
Mastering Peachtree Basics
In This Chapter
 Starting Peachtree
 Navigating the Peachtree screen
 Getting help
I
f you have been keeping your financial records using manual methods, you
know how time consuming it can be. Plus, keeping books manually provides
too many opportunities for human error. Using Peachtree saves you both time
and money; in addition, you can know at any moment in time your complete
financial status. We know you’re eager to get started. Operating a business is 
a nonstop process, but to computerize your accounting, you have to put first
things first.
To work effectively, take some time to get comfortable with some of the fea-
tures unique to Peachtree. In this chapter, you find out how to navigate in the
software as well as open and close companies as needed. We also show you
where you can turn for additional assistance. If you’re ready, dig in.
Starting the Program
You have a choice: You can start Peachtree the easy way or the hard way. We
prefer the easy way. When you installed Peachtree, with your permission, it
placed a Peachtree icon on your Windows desktop. Assuming (we know, we’re
not supposed to assume) that you haven’t thrown that icon into the Recycle
Bin, you can simply double-click the Peachtree icon (the one with the peachy
little peach on it), and the program starts.
To make sure that Peachtree always starts in a full-sized (maximized)
window, right-click the Peachtree icon and click Properties. In the resulting
dialog box, click the drop-down arrow in the Run box, select Maximized, and
then click OK to accept the changes.

If you did throw the icon away or you have so many icons on your desktop that
you can’t see it, okay, you can start Peachtree the hard way. Choose Start➪
All Programs➪Peachtree Premium Accounting 2005➪Peachtree Premium
Accounting 2005— for a total of four mouse clicks.
Choosing opening options
After you start Peachtree, what do you do with it? The Peachtree Start Screen
appears as shown in Figure 1-1, beckoning you to do one of several things.
You can select any of the following options or click the Close button to close
the window:
 Open an existing company: Use this option to open a company already
existing in Peachtree.
 Create a new company: Select this option to set up your business with
the Peachtree Setup Wizard. (Chapter 2 covers this wizard.)
 Explore a sample company: Use this option to explore one of several
fictitious companies. One company, Bellwether Garden Supply, is a retail
and service company that uses most of the features of Peachtree, includ-
ing inventory and job costing. Depending on the Peachtree edition you
are using, you may have additional sample companies to investigate.
You explore one of these in the steps in the following section.
 Take a Guided Tour of Peachtree: Wander down this path when you’ve
got some extra time and try to spot some of the things that you see in
this book.
 Convert from a QuickBooks or One-Write Plus Company: If you have
finally come to your senses and want to transfer to Peachtree from that
other software, click this choice. Peachtree helps to make the conversion
pretty painless.
Exploring a sample company
You can best explore Peachtree’s features by opening the Bellwether Garden
Supply sample company and finding out how to move around in Peachtree.
To open a sample company, follow these steps:
1. Click Explore a Sample Company.
If you’re using Peachtree First Accounting or Peachtree Accounting,
Bellwether Garden Supply immediately opens.
If you’re using Peachtree Complete Accounting or Peachtree Premium
Accounting, the Explore a Sample Company dialog box opens.
10
Part I: Getting Started 

2. Click the radio button next to the sample company that you want to
explore.
For this example, click Bellwether Garden Supply.
3. Click OK.
As with other Windows programs, the name of the currently open com-
pany appears at the top of the window in the Peachtree title bar.
Getting around town
When you first open a sample company, the Peachtree Today window appears.
(See Bonus Chapter 2 on this book’s Web site for more information about the
Peachtree Today window.) For now, click the Close box to close the Peachtree
Today window.
Although the main menu window of Peachtree looks pretty plain, don’t skip
too lightly through it. The window actually displays several pieces of informa-
tion. At the bottom of the screen, the Windows-style status bar (see Figure 1-2)
displays information about the field, window, or menu choice that you happen
to be using, as well as the current date, a toolbar, and the current accounting
period. We think that the toolbar Calculator tool is especially helpful! 
Figure 1-1:

Screen.
11
Chapter 1: Mastering Peachtree Basics

Hover your mouse over each tool on the main application toolbar to see a
Tool Tip description of its function. 
Choosing menu commands
The pull-down menus should be a familiar sight from your other Windows
programs. Even though the other menu choices are important, you’re likely
to spend the majority of your time in Peachtree using the following three
main menu choices:
 Maintain: This menu offers choices for working with data records. For
example, you can store vendor, customer, inventory, and employee infor-
mation, including names, addresses, and phone numbers.
A record is all the information about one person, product, event, and so
on. Every record in a database contains the same fields. A field is one item
of information in a record, such as an ID, name, or transaction number. To
explore the parts of the information that you store in Peachtree, see the
“Exploring fields and records” section, later in this chapter.
 Tasks: This menu is where you do your normal day-to-day work. You can
bill your customers, buy materials, and pay your workers by using the
Tasks menu.
 Reports: This menu is where it all comes together and where you can
see the results of all your hard work.
Opening a Company
Maybe you need to keep numbers for more than one business. Peachtree
enables you to account for the financial information of more than one com-
pany. Although you can open only one company at a time, you can switch
back and forth between companies very easily.

Part I: Getting Started 

Opening a Peachtree company 
from within Peachtree
The steps to open a company differ, depending on whether you’re opening a
company while already in a Peachtree company or whether you’re opening a
company from the Peachtree Start Screen. (See Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s
Web site to find out how to hide the Start Screen and have Peachtree open
directly to your company.) If you’re already in a Peachtree company and want
to open a different one, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Open Company (or press Ctrl+O).
You get an annoying little message telling you that you’re closing the
current company. Peachtree allows only one open company at a time.
Click the Do not display this message again check box to permanently
disable the message box.
2. Click OK to acknowledge the message.
The Open dialog box appears.
3. From the Open dialog box, click the company name and then click OK.
The newly opened company name appears at the top of the screen. No
matter which company you open, the menu choices remain the same.
Opening a recently used 
Peachtree company
If you find yourself frequently switching back and forth between several com-
panies, Peachtree provides an easier method; the Open Previous Company
option. This option lists up to ten previously opened Peachtree company
names from which you can select. Follow these steps to open a previously
open company:
1. Choose File➪Open Previous Company.
A list of previously open Peachtree company names appears.
2. Click the company name that you want to open.
The annoying little message that we mention in the previous section
appears unless you turned it off.
3. Click OK to acknowledge the message.
The selected company opens on the screen.
13
Chapter 1: Mastering Peachtree Basics

Opening a company from the 
Peachtree Start Screen
If you’re opening a company from the Peachtree Start Screen, a different
dialog box appears. To open a company from the Peachtree Start Screen,
follow these steps:
1. Click Open an existing company to display the Open an Existing
Company dialog box.
This dialog box lists the companies that you recently opened in
Peachtree. If the company name that you want to open doesn’t appear,
click the Browse button and make your selection from the Open dialog
box.
2. Click the company name that you want to open and then click OK.
The selected company opens.
Exploring Peachtree’s Windows
Most windows in Peachtree are similar. They have places for you to fill in infor-
mation and buttons that you use to take actions in that particular window. The
Maintain Customers/Prospects window is typical of many other windows that
you use in Peachtree. For an example, open Bellwether Garden Supply and
choose Maintain➪Customers/Prospects. Take a stroll around this window.
Managing window sizes and placement
Depending on your screen size and resolution, you might not see enough of a
window to suit your needs. Some windows, such as the Sales/Invoice window,
display more lines when made larger. If you resize the window manually,
Peachtree remembers that setting and uses it each time. You can also maxi-
mize the window, and Peachtree remembers that you like it maximized. 
Place your mouse pointer around the border of any window until the pointer
displays as a double-headed arrow. Click and drag the border until the window
is the appropriate size.
Exploring fields and records
The main part of a Peachtree window consists of fields. Stop for a moment
and ponder these components. When we refer to fields, we’re not talking
14
Part I: Getting Started 

about the place corn grows. Fields are pieces of information that fit into a
record, which is a type of electronic 3 x 5 index card. A record is all the infor-
mation about one customer, vendor, employee, or inventory part, but a field
is one piece of the record such as the ID, name, or phone number. In Figure
1-3, the record is all of the information about Archer Scapes and Ponds, and
Nancy Archer is in the Contact field.
Looking up information
Some fields, such as Customer ID, have a magnifying glass next to them. These
fields contain lookup lists that display a list of your customers (or vendors,
accounts, employees, inventory items, and so on). You can choose a record
from a lookup list. Depending on the global options that you set, a lookup list
may automatically appear as you type any character in the field, or you can
click the lookup list indicator (the magnifying glass) to display the list that’s
relevant to the current field. (See Figure 1-2.)
Optionally, to display the lookup list, either click the right mouse button in a
lookup box or press the Shift key along with the question mark (?).
You can do any of the following while in a lookup list:
 Select a customer (vendor, item, and so on) and then click OK.
Peachtree selects the highlighted record and closes the lookup list.
 Click Cancel to close the lookup list without selecting a record.
Lookup list indicator
Browse buttons
Figure 1-3:
Each record
has many
different
fields.
15
Chapter 1: Mastering Peachtree Basics

 Use the Find feature to search for a string of characters. The search
covers any text that you can see in the displayed list. The Find feature 
is not case sensitive. Press Enter after you type the lookup text in the
entry box. Peachtree highlights the first item that matches your request.
 Click Find Next to find the next instance of the previously entered Find
text. If no next instance exists, the Find feature skips to the first instance
in the lookup list. If no instance exists at all, the Find Next feature does
nothing.
 Click Sort to sort the displayed list either alphabetically by the ID or
name. (Numbers come before letters.)
 Use the Help option if you need it.
Some lookup lists, particularly the ones in the Task menu selections, have
two additional buttons.
 Use the New button to add customers, vendors, employees, or inventory
items on-the-fly, which means Peachtree adds the record right in the
middle of entering a transaction.
 Click the Edit button to edit the record of a customer, vendor, employee,
or inventory item.
Just browsing
Similar to buttons you use with a Web browser, Peachtree includes browse but-
tons to quickly scan the next record or the previous record. If you’re in a main-
tenance window, such as Maintain Customers/Prospects or Maintain Inventory
Items, the browse buttons move between the records in the order of customer
ID or inventory item ID.
If you’re in a Task window, the browse buttons move between the previous
transaction and the next transaction.
Making a date
Many Peachtree windows have date fields where you need to enter data based
on the calendar. If you’re a keyboard-type person, you can simply type the
date. Dates need to be typed as numbers. If you want, you can type the date 
by using the / (slash) key, but the slash isn’t necessary. For example, to enter
September 16, 2004, type 091604 or 09/16/04. Be aware that Peachtree doesn’t
allow you to use a dash (-) in a date.
16
Part I: Getting Started 

In most Peachtree date fields, you can get away with entering just the first
four digits of a date. Peachtree then enters the year. The year is based on the
system date displayed on the Peachtree status bar.
Now if you’re like us, we need a calendar in front of us to select dates.
Fortunately, Peachtree fields that require you to select a date also include a
calendar, shown in Figure 1-4, so you can click that to select a date. To select
a date from the calendar, follow these steps:
1. Click the calendar icon next to a date field to display the current
month.
2. Click the left-pointing arrow next to the month name to display a previ-
ous month or click the right-pointing arrow to display a future month.
3. Click the date that you want for the date field.
The small calendar closes, and the date appears in the field.
Using the window toolbar
Earlier in this chapter, we mention the Peachtree toolbar, which appears on the
status bar at the bottom of your screen. Most Peachtree windows include their
Calendar icon
Figure 1-4:
Click a date
to insert 
it into a
Peachtree
date field.
17
Chapter 1: Mastering Peachtree Basics

own toolbars located across the top of the window. You use the Peachtree tool-
bar across the top of the window to complete the various tasks involved with
the selected window.
The exact buttons vary slightly from window to window, but most of them
have a Close button. To get out of a Peachtree window, you can use the Close
button or the Windows Close button (X).
If you position the mouse pointer over any button on the toolbar, a small
yellow box called a Tool Tip appears to explain the use of the button. Tool
Tips are great for those CRS moments when you look at a button and cannot
remember its function. CRS (Can’t Remember Stuff) is a widespread disease
that affects people of all ages, races, religions, and hair colors.
You also use the Save button frequently. The Save button appears on the tool-
bar if you’re modifying data records, such as customers, from the Maintenance
menu or if you’re using a transaction entry window under the Tasks menu,
such as Payroll Entry or Inventory Adjustments. You click the Save button 
to save the displayed transaction, and if you’re using the real-time posting
method, Peachtree also posts the transaction to the General Ledger (G/L). 
(See Chapter 2 for an explanation of posting methods.)
Post is one of those words with many different meanings. It can be a noun like
the place you tie your horse, or it can be a verb and mean to send. Of course,
the latter is how the word post is used in accounting, and it means to save and
send. In Peachtree, you’re sending transactions to the general ledger (G/L);
then, when you want to find out whether you’ve made any money this month,
Peachtree is able to show you.
Getting a Helping Hand
We really hope that you get most of the answers you need from this book.
However . . . sometimes you need additional assistance.
What’s this all about?
If you’re in a Peachtree window and don’t quite know what a particular field
represents or what you’re supposed to enter in that field, you can use the
What’s This feature, which is similar to features that you’ve probably used in
other Windows applications. In Peachtree, right-click the field where you need
a hint. Then choose What’s This from the menu that appears. A summary defi-
nition of the field appears. To close a What’s This text box, click inside it.

For our next demonstration . . .
Peachtree includes a series of demonstrative movies to help you with some key
practices. The demos include topics such as how to make backups, change
accounting periods, drill down in reports, and a variety of other subjects.
1. Choose Help➪Show Me How To to display a list of demo topics.
2. Select the demo that you want to see.
A demonstration window appears. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.
Be nice and share the popcorn!
Using the Help Contents
The Peachtree Help system works in an HTML format, which simply means
that it looks and works similar to a Web page. For easy navigation, the help
windows have Back and Forward buttons as well as a Home button. To open
the Help Contents, follow these steps:
1. Choose Help➪Contents and Index to open the Peachtree Help window.
The Contents tab appears on top. The Help Contents feature presents
help information in a book-like format, making browsing available topics
easy. If you’ve used the Help Contents tab in other Windows programs,
you already know how to use the Help Contents in Peachtree.
2. If they aren’t already displayed, click the Contents tab to display a list
of topics available in Peachtree Help.
3. Double-click a book to open that topic.
4. Continue opening books until you find the topic that you want to read.
5. Click the page icon to display the topic.
The help information is displayed on the right side of the screen. From
this point, you can click the underlined hyperlinks to jump to related
topics or print a topic.
Using the Help Index
Use the Help Index to look up a keyword or phrase in the extensive online
index. The Peachtree Help Index feature works the same as the Help Index in
other Windows applications. To use the Help Index, follow these steps:
1. Choose Help➪Contents and Index to open the Peachtree Help window.
2. Click the Index tab.
19
Chapter 1: Mastering Peachtree Basics

3. Scroll through the index to locate the term that you’re looking for.
Peachtree lists the index in alphabetical order.
4. Double-click a keyword.
Peachtree displays a list of topics relevant to the keyword you selected.
5. Double-click the topic you want.
Peachtree displays the topical information on the Help window’s right
panel.
If all else fails, you can also access the Peachtree manuals from the Help menu.

Chapter 2
Setting Up Your Company
In This Chapter
 Supplying your company information
 Specifying an accounting method
 Identifying accounting periods
P
eachtree tracks all kinds of information, including the names and
addresses of your customers, vendors, or employees, and any business
transactions that you’ve made with them. But before Peachtree can do any of
that, you have to tell the software about your company. You need to tell it the
usual stuff such as name and address. (That’s so you don’t forget who you
are. . . .) You also need to tell it when you want to pay Uncle Sam taxes on the
money that you earn and spend. (Sorry, but never is not an option.)
Keep this important fact in mind: Two of the options that you determine when
setting up a Peachtree company are written in stone — no going backward.
One is whether you run your business on a cash or an accrual basis, and the
other is the time frame of your accounting year. We talk about these issues in
the accounting method and accounting period sections of this chapter.
Starting the New Company Setup Wizard
When you want to create a new company, the New Company Setup Wizard
simplifies the task for you. It asks you the basic questions in the order that
Peachtree needs to set up your business. (If you’re not setting up a new com-
pany but are simply changing settings, see Chapter 4.)
You access the New Company Setup Wizard when you click Create a new com-
pany from the Peachtree start screen. Like most wizards, the New Company
Setup Wizard guides you through the process. You’ve probably used wizards
dozens of times (not to mention when you install most applications, such as
Peachtree), so we keep things short and sweet.

If you’re already in Peachtree and want to create a new company, choose
File➪New Company to start the New Company Setup Wizard.
When you’re done checking out the opening screen, click Next to move to the
next screen.
The following sections walk you through each step of the New Company
Setup Wizard.
Introducing Your Business to Peachtree
The left half of the New Company Setup Wizard screen is pretty self-explanatory.
Fill in your business name, address, city, two-letter state name, and, optionally,
country. Notice we say country — not county! Many people misread this line. You
see country fields other places in Peachtree. Use the Tab or Enter keys to fill in
or skip through the fields.
The first item on the right side of the screen asks for your business type. To
fill in the rest of the screen, follow these steps:
1. Click the drop-down list to display and select a Business Type.
Options are Corporation, S Corporation, Partnership, Sole Proprietorship,
or Limited Liability Company. Selecting a type of business tells Peachtree
how to determine equity accounts.
Equity is what’s left after you subtract the company’s liabilities from the
assets. The equity is the value of a company to its owners. In a corpora-
tion, the equity is divided among the stockholders, but if the business is 
a sole proprietorship or partnership, the equity belongs to the individual
owner or owners, respectively. If you’re not sure what type of business
you have, talk with your accountant.
2. Enter your information in the Federal Employer, State Employer, and
State Unemployment IDs fields.
If your state doesn’t use employer IDs or unemployment IDs, leave these
fields blank.
3. Click Next to move to the Chart of Accounts screen.
4. Select a Chart of Accounts option (see Figure 2-1) and then click Next.
If you’re not sure which option to select, read the section “Selecting a
Chart of Accounts,” later in this chapter.

What you see next depends on the option that you selected. For exam-
ple, if you chose to set up a new company based on one of the several
sample companies, a list of business descriptions appears. Don’t worry
if the descriptions of the accounts that you select don’t match yours
completely; you can edit them after you’re done with the New Company
Setup wizard. (Chapter 3 shows you how to customize the Chart of
Accounts.)
If you choose to copy settings from an existing Peachtree company, a list
of existing Peachtree companies appears. Peachtree asks whether you
want to copy default information from these other companies. Usually,
you do want to copy default information.
5. Select the sample Chart of Accounts that most closely matches your
business or click the company from which you want to copy; then
click Next.
The Accounting Method screen appears.
6. Select an accounting method and then click Next.
For important information on choosing an accounting method, see
“Selecting an Accounting Method” later in this chapter.
The accounting method is one of the two items that you can’t change
after you finish creating your Peachtree company. Be sure of your
method before proceeding.
7. Select a posting method and then click Next.
To understand posting methods, see “Selecting a Posting Method,” later
in this chapter.
The Accounting Periods screen appears.

8. Select an accounting period structure option and then click Next.
See “Selecting Accounting Periods,” later in this chapter, if you’re not
sure which option to select.
The accounting period is the second of the two items that you can’t
change after you finish creating your Peachtree company. Be sure of
your accounting periods before proceeding.
9. Select the dates as requested and click Next.
The default screen that appears next displays how Peachtree sets up the
standard (default) information for your vendors, customers, and inven-
tory items. Don’t worry if you don’t plan on using one of these modules,
or if the information is incorrect. (See Chapter 4 for information on
changing the default information.)
10. Click Next. The final setup screen appears.
Congratulations! You’re almost finished with the New Company Setup
Wizard. Optionally, you can have Peachtree display a checklist of steps
to continue setting up your company information.
We recommend using the Back button to double-check that the account-
ing method and accounting periods are correct before you click Finish.
After you click Finish, you can’t change them.
11. Click Finish.
Peachtree creates a set of data files for your company and displays the
Peachtree Today screen.
The Peachtree Today screen includes a Setup Guide that’s designed to walk
you through the remainder of the setup process.
Selecting a Chart of Accounts
The New Company Setup Wizard also asks you to choose how you want to
start your Chart of Accounts. If you’re a new business, you might want to
choose one of the samples provided by Peachtree, or you might already have
a Chart of Accounts supplied by your accountant.
The Chart of Accounts lists the names that you use to classify transaction
information and categorizes the accounts so that they appear in appropriate
places on financial statements. If you’re not sure which Chart of Accounts to
select, you can choose one of the sample Charts of Accounts that are supplied
by Peachtree. Peachtree has listed dozens of business types (6.25 dozen, or 75,
to be exact), and each one includes accounts typical to the selected business
type. For example, the accounts that a shoe store uses are different from those
that a drugstore or a dentist uses.
24
Part I: Getting Started 

Accounts are the systematic arrangement of numbers and descriptions to
keep records of the business that your company transacts. Each time you
buy or sell something, you record the transaction and assign it to one or
more accounts. Accounts help you organize information by grouping similar
transactions together.
Peachtree has several Chart of Accounts options (refer to Figure 2-1):
 Set Up a New Retail, Service, Construction, Manufacturing, or
Distribution Company, Using a Simplified Chart of Accounts: This option
allows you to select from one of the predefined Charts of Accounts that
comes with Peachtree. The simplified Chart of Accounts includes the
basic accounts that a retail, service, construction, manufacturing, or dis-
tribution company might use.
 Set Up a New Company Using an Extensive Chart of Accounts from
One of Many Sample Companies: This option allows you to select from
one of the seventy-five detailed predefined charts of accounts that are
industry specific such as florist, auto repair, beauty repair or video
rental businesses.
 Copy Settings from an Existing Peachtree Accounting Company: This
option copies the Chart of Accounts from a Peachtree company that’s
already set up. Use this option if you’re starting your Peachtree company
books over or starting another company with a similar Chart of Accounts.
 Convert a Company from Another Accounting Program: Select this
option if you’re switching from Peachtree Complete Accounting for DOS,
Quicken, or Quickbooks.
 Build Your Own Company: Use this choice if your accountant has sup-
plied you with an account list or you’re starting with a manual system
that uses account numbers.
 Consolidate Existing Peachtree Accounting Companies: If you’re using
one of the Peachtree Premium versions, you can select this option to
combine the Charts of Accounts of other existing Peachtree companies
to create a new consolidated Chart of Accounts.
Selecting an Accounting Method
At the beginning of this chapter, we mention that you enter two pieces of per-
manent information in the New Company Setup Wizard. Selecting your
accounting method is one of those two pieces of info. Your business can be
accrual-based or cash-based.
Because you must report your accounting method to the IRS, don’t just arbi-
trarily pick one. If you’re not sure, ask your accountant. Doing so might just
keep you out of jail.

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Company

Selecting a Posting Method
The posting method determines how Peachtree processes or transfers the
transactions that you enter from the individual journals to the general ledger.
You have two options: real-time or batch posting. You can switch posting
methods at any time.
Journals are electronic or paper records of accounting transactions. Peachtree
has many different types of journals. For example, the Cash Receipts journal
stores transactions of money that you receive, and the Cash Disbursements
journal stores transactions of the money that you spend. Through posting, the
journals ultimately go into the General Ledger (G/L), where Peachtree sorts
the information and reports it to you on financial statements.
If you choose real-time posting, Peachtree posts the transactions to both the
individual journals (like Cash Receipts) and to the G/L as you enter and save
transactions. This posting method immediately updates the company’s finan-
cial information. For example, if an accrual-based business using real-time
posting enters an invoice to a customer and then prints an income statement,
that invoice is included in the income totals.
Real-time posting can save you a lot of time. We recommend that you use the
real-time posting method.

Part I: Getting Started 
Accrual or cash: What’s the difference?
An accrual-based business is one that recog-
nizes income in the month an invoice was
issued to a customer, regardless of when that
customer decides to pay. Also, accrual-based
businesses recognize a purchase as an
expense in the month that you make the pur-
chase, not whenever you write the check to
your supplier.
A cash-based business is one that declares
income in the month that you receive the pay-
ment from your customer and expenses in the
month that you actually write the check to your
supplier. Dates of customer invoices and vendor
bills play no role in a cash-based business.
Say, for example, that you sell a $20,000 service
to Smith and Sons on December 13th. You
invoice them right away, but they don’t pay you
until April 2nd of the next year. Do you declare
that $20,000 as part of your sales for December?
If the answer is yes, you’re running an accrual-
based business. If that $20,000 doesn’t show up
on your income statement until April 2005,
you’re running a cash-based business.
100 235

83

If you choose batch posting, Peachtree saves the transactions and then posts
them in a group when you initiate the posting process. When you use batch
posting, you can print registers and check the batch of transactions before
posting them to the journals.
While using batch posting, Peachtree prompts you to post journals when nec-
essary. For example, before you enter a customer receipt, you need to have
all the invoices posted.
Selecting Accounting Periods
According to a calendar in our office (the one with the Yorkshire Terriers all
over it), a new year starts on January 1. Some businesses, however, start their
business years, or fiscal years, at different times. You can’t watch Dick Clark as
the new fiscal year rolls in, but I guess if you want, you could have champagne
and throw confetti. (For details on closing a fiscal year, see Chapter 17.)
Entering the fiscal periods correctly in Peachtree is very important. Selecting
the accounting periods is the second of the two permanent items you set in
the New Company Setup Wizard. After you create fiscal periods, you can’t
change them.
You can choose from two options on this screen:
 Twelve Monthly Accounting Periods: Each accounting period’s starting
and ending dates match those of the 12 calendar months. On the next
screen, you can choose the month to start your fiscal year.
 Accounting Periods That Do Not Match the Calendar Month: Select this
option if you want to set up a custom fiscal year structure. For example,
you might want four accounting periods per year or possibly 13 four-
week accounting periods per year.
On the next screen, Peachtree prompts you to choose the year and month
that you want to begin entering data. If you choose to set your own fiscal cal-
endar month, Peachtree also asks you to enter the number of accounting
periods that you want to use. Most businesses use 12 accounting periods,
based on the calendar months.

 Understanding account types

 Modifying the Chart of Accounts
W
e know you’re eager to start using the software. But before you dive
in, we need to tell you a little about the Chart of Accounts, which
serves as the foundation for all your reports. To make sure that you get the
reports you want, you might find that a little planning at this stage is wise.
Some of the material in this chapter might seem a little dry because it deals
with accounting principles and information that you need for your big picture
financial tracking, but understanding this information helps you set up the
Chart of Accounts that produces the business reports that you want.
Understanding the Chart of Accounts
You use accounts to keep records of the business that your company trans-
acts. Each time you buy or sell something, you record the transaction in the
appropriate accounts. Accounts help you organize information by keeping
similar transactions together. In today’s world, for example, you probably get
several different telephone bills for your regular phone, your fax phone, your
cellular phone, your pager, and so on. But when you think of the big picture,
all the bills are related to telephone expenses. So when you pay these bills,
you record all the transactions in the Telephone Expense account.
The Chart of Accounts is nothing more than the list of all your accounts. The
Chart of Accounts doesn’t show any amounts — just titles and numbers that
you assign to each account. But like any list, you can and should organize the
Chart of Accounts to make the best use of it. So where do you get a list of your
accounts and their balances? Use the General Ledger Trial Balance report. See
Chapter 14 for details.

Understanding account types
Good accountants and bookkeepers are typically very organized people —
they would hate what they do (and probably wouldn’t do it for long) if they
weren’t. So, it should come as no big surprise that they’ve invented a method
to help them organize things further.
To organize the Chart of Accounts, accounting uses account types. Usually,
accounts are broken down into five general categories of account types:
 Assets: Things that you own but don’t sell to customers. Money in check-
ing and savings accounts, computers, trucks, and money that others owe
you are all assets.
 Liabilities: Debts that you owe to others. Bills from your vendors and
bank loans are liabilities.
 Equity: Also known as net worth, equity represents the amount that
owners have invested in the company. Some people prefer to think 
of equity as the owner’s claim against the assets of the company (as
opposed to liabilities, which are outsiders’ claims against the business).
Basically, if you used your assets to pay off your liabilities, what you’d
have left is equity.
 Income: The sales that you make to your customers. Income and rev-
enue are interchangeable terms.
 Expenses: The cost of staying in business to do business. The wages
that you pay your employees and the money that you spend advertising
are expenses.
You can break down these account types even further to organize them. In
Table 3-1, you see the account types that are available in Peachtree, their gen-
eral categories, and what they represent. The sidebar “Accounting terms for
account types” gives the accounting details on these types.

less than one year. Short-term loans are
other current liabilities.
Long-Term Liabilities
Liability
The value of debts that you must pay
but you have longer than one year to
pay them. A three-year bank loan to buy
a truck is a long-term liability.
Equity–doesn’t close
Equity
The value of things, such as common
stock, that carries forward from year to

Equity
The value of equity accounts that don’t
carry forward from year to year but
instead become part of retained earn-

Equity
The accumulated value of net profits or 
Earnings
losses. Peachtree automatically
updates this account for you when you
close your year.
Income
Income
The value of sales that you make to your

Generally, the price that you pay for
purchased goods for resale or to use in
manufacturing goods for resale is the
cost of sales.
Expenses
Expense
The costs that your business incurs to
operate, such as wages, rent, and 
electricity.
Accrual-based businesses must use an Accounts Receivable account and an
Accounts Payable account, but many cash-based businesses also want to use
these accounts to produce an aging report of customers’ outstanding bal-
ances or of bills that are due to vendors. See Chapter 2 for more on account-
ing methods.
Keep a couple notes in mind about the account types and equity accounts in
your Chart of Accounts: The account type that you choose for an account
determines the financial report on which it appears and the placement on the
financial report. Consider the three main financial reports: the Income
Statement, the Balance Sheet, and the Trial Balance. Income and Expense
accounts appear on the Income Statement, but not on the Balance Sheet. The
Balance Sheet shows all Asset, Liability, and Equity accounts. The Trial
Balance shows all account types, in the following order: Assets, Liabilities,
Equity, Income, and Expense.
32
Part I: Getting Started 

The account type also determines how Peachtree handles the account when
you close your year. For example, Peachtree zeros out Income and Expense
accounts but doesn’t zero out Asset or Liability accounts. Keep in mind the
following points about equity:
 You can have only one Equity-Retained Earnings account.
 You should show the initial investment in the business as either Paid-In
Capital, if your business type is a corporation, or Owner’s Contributions,
if your business type is a proprietorship (sole or partnership) or an LLC
(Limited Liability Company). These are Equity-doesn’t close account
types.
 You should track withdrawals from the initial investment using a
Dividends Paid (corporation) or Owner’s Draw (proprietorship) 
account; these accounts are Equity-gets closed account types.
The sum of the Equity–Retained Earnings account and any Equity–doesn’t
close accounts (you can have more than one Equity–doesn’t close account
types) equals the net worth of the company prior to the current year.
Numbering accounts
Okay, in the previous section, we discuss account types, which help you orga-
nize the appearance of accounts on financial statements. The account num-
bers that you use can also affect the information that you can present on
financial reports.
33
Chapter 3: Designing the Chart of Accounts
Accounting terms for account types
Nonworking capital is something that you own
and don’t sell to customers, but you could sell it
to turn it into cash. Certificates of deposit (CDs)
are an example of nonworking capital. The
length of time before the CD matures deter-
mines whether it is an other current asset or an
other asset. If your company owns CDs or
bonds that don’t mature for at least one year,
you have other assets.
Income and revenue are interchangeable terms.
Some people call cost of sales, cost of goods
sold — same thing.

First, understand that Peachtree places very few restrictions on the number-
ing scheme that you use. Be aware of the following points when you develop
your account numbering scheme:
 Peachtree sorts Account IDs alphabetically — that means numbers first,
and you need to use leading zeros to get numbers to sort in numerical
order (I know that sounds stupid, but it’s true). For example, to get the
numbers 1, 27, 100, and 1000 to sort in the order just listed, you’d need
to enter them as 0001, 0027, 0100, and 1000.
 Account IDs can contain any printable character except the asterisk (*),
the plus sign (+), and the question mark (?).
 Account IDs cannot contain leading or trailing blanks, but you can use
blanks in the middle.
 Account IDs are case sensitive; cash and CASH are two different accounts.
Most people use numbers, not letters, for Account IDs, and they use letters
for the account’s description. The description appears on all reports; the
Account ID appears on only some reports.
Because Peachtree places so few restrictions on the Account ID, you can use
any scheme you want, but we strongly suggest that you keep it logical. For
example, many companies number all asset accounts in the 10000 range, lia-
bility accounts in the 20000 range, equity accounts in the 30000 range, income
accounts in the 40000 range, cost of sales accounts in the 50000 range, and
expense accounts in the 60000 range or higher.
Handling departments or locations
Suppose that your business has multiple geographic locations, and each loca-
tion generates income and expenses. Or suppose that you don’t have geo-
graphic locations but you do have multiple departments, and each department
generates income and expenses that you want to track. Of course, you want to
produce a company-wide income statement, but how do you want it to look?
Perhaps you want a detailed Income Statement that’s broken down by depart-
ment, like the one in Figure 3-1. Or, maybe you want an Income Statement that
summarizes the information for all departments, like the one in Figure 3-2. Or
maybe you want to be able to produce Income Statements for individual
departments, like the one shown in Figure 3-3.
Because we show you all three formats, it’s safe to assume that you can pro-
duce any of these reports in Peachtree. But to do so, you must correctly set
up the numbering of your Chart of Accounts.

Chapter 3: Designing the Chart of Accounts

Setting up departmental account numbers
To produce these reports, Peachtree uses a concept called masking that
enables you, through the use of account numbers, to easily limit the infor-
mation that appears on reports. To use masking, you divide your account
number into segments; you assign the account number, say, 40000, to the first
segment and then assign a digit or two to the second segment of the number
to represent the department or location. That is, 40000-01 might be income
for Department 1, and 40000-02 could be income for Department 2. The impli-
cation here is that the first segment of the account (40000) would appear sev-
eral different times in your Chart of Accounts, but the second segment would
contain a different department number. And, you can set up a 00 level for the
account (that is, 40000-00) that Peachtree can use to display the sum of all
the departments and represent the company as a whole. You record sales
and purchases or payments by using the account number that represents the
department responsible for the sale, purchase, or payment. You would never
record a transaction in the 00 level account. Your expense accounts would
work the same way if you want to track costs separately for each department.
If your situation is more complex, and you want to track expenses for multi-
ple locations and for multiple departments at each location, your account
number should include both a location segment and a department segment.
To track sales for Location 1, Department 1, your Sales account number
might be 40000-01-01, where the first 01 tracks the Location and the second
01 tracks the Department. Table 3-2 shows the various possible combinations
for Sales accounts that you might find in your Chart of Accounts if you had
three locations and three departments:

Statement
for a single
department.

Table 3-2
Sample Combinations for Accounts Using 
Locations and Departments

40000-02-03
Sales for Location 3, Department 2
40000-03-02
Sales for Location 3, Department 3
40000-03-03
Be sure to allow the maximum number of characters that you need for your
departments and locations and keep future growth in mind. For example, if
you have ten or more departments, you need two digits for your department
number. Don’t forget to use a leading zero for department numbers less than
ten (for example, 01, 02, 03, and so on).
If you are using any version of Peachtree other than Peachtree Premium and
you want to use masking, do so when creating your chart of accounts by
simply setting up the appropriate account numbers. If you are using Peachtree
Premium, you can add masking to your existing chart of accounts. Follow these
steps to identify your account segment structure in Peachtree. 
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪General Ledger.
Peachtree displays the General Ledger Defaults dialog box shown in
Figure 3-4.
2. Click the Account Segments tab.
3. Click in the Segment Description text box and type a description of
the portion of the account number that you want to define.
4. Click in the Length text box and type the value that represents the
number of digits you want to assign to this segment of the account
number.
5. Click the Separator drop-down list arrow and select a character to sep-
arate portions of the account number.
6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 for each segment that you want to define.
7. Click OK.
37
Chapter 3: Designing the Chart of Accounts

If you’re identifying segments for an existing Chart of Accounts, Peachtree
displays a message that tells you how many accounts you currently have that
don’t match the segment structure that you defined when you clicked OK.
Simply click OK when you see the message and edit your Chart of Accounts
to provide the new segment numbers as appropriate by using the information
in the next section. Remember, you don’t need to assign numbers for any seg-
ment other than the first segment of your account number — the other seg-
ments are optional. Many people use them only for Income and Expense
accounts.
Consolidating departmental figures
You can extend the department/location scenario from the previous section
one step further. Suppose that you find yourself in the situation where you
have two or three geographic locations that each need to use Peachtree —
and you’re not networked. You can set up separate companies in Peachtree,
but at the end of an accounting period, you won’t have a consolidated finan-
cial statement to show the true financial picture of your company. Or sup-
pose that your check writing volume exceeds 200 transactions per month. In
this case, Peachtree can begin to operate quite slowly; therefore, you might
want to consider breaking your company into multiple companies and then
consolidating to produce reports.
In Peachtree Premium, you can consolidate companies by creating a new
company that contains — or consolidates — companies that you select. 
If you are not using Peachtree Premium, you can purchase the Consolidation
Wizard, an add-on product that allows you to use multiple companies in
Peachtree and consolidate the information in those companies into one
master company. For more information on the Consolidation Wizard and
other add-on products for Peachtree, see Bonus Chapter 4 on this book’s Web
site.

38
Part I: Getting Started 

If you segment the Chart of Accounts in each company in the same way
(whether you use Peachtree Premium’s consolidation feature or you use the
Consolidation Wizard add-on product), consolidating is quick and painless and
lets you produce departmental as well as company-wide financial statements.
Modifying the Chart of Accounts
Once you understand account types, numbering, and so on, you can dive in
and make additions, changes, or deletions to the Chart of Accounts. To make
any changes to the Chart of Accounts, use the Maintain Chart of Accounts
window, shown in Figure 3-5.
Adding new accounts
To add an account, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Chart of Accounts and, in the Maintain Chart of
Accounts window, type a number for the new account in the Account
ID text box.
Peachtree opens the account list and shows you the number of the
account that most closely matches the number you typed. Make sure
that you type a new number — one that doesn’t already exist.
2. In the Description text box, type a name for the account as you want it
to appear on reports.
3. Open the Account Type drop-down list box and select the correct
account type for the account that you’re adding.
4. Click Save.

Chapter 3: Designing the Chart of Accounts

If you create an account number that doesn’t match the segmenting scheme,
you see a message. You can click OK and create the account despite the 
message.
Editing accounts
You can edit the Account ID, description, and account type of an account by
following these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Chart of Accounts to display the Maintain Chart of
Accounts window (refer to Figure 3-5).
2. Click the lookup list indicator to the right of the Account ID text box
or type some characters of the Account ID to display the account list.
3. Highlight the account and click OK or press Enter.
4. Retype the description or change the account type.
5. To change the Account ID, click the ChangeID button on the toolbar.
Peachtree displays the Change Account ID dialog box shown in Figure 3-6.
6. Type a new Account ID and click OK.
7. Click Save.
Deleting accounts
You can delete accounts that have no activity — that is, you haven’t used
them in any transactions. Choose Maintain➪Chart of Accounts to display the
Maintain Chart of Accounts window. Select the account; then click the Delete
button.
If you try to delete an account that you’ve used in transactions, Peachtree
tells you that it can’t delete the account. You can, however, set the status of
the account to Inactive. If you choose to hide inactive accounts, they don’t
appear in the list of any transaction window. In addition, hidden accounts
don’t appear on any report except the Chart of Accounts report. Only people
Figure 3-6:

40
Part I: Getting Started 

who know the account’s number are able to use it. To make an account inac-
tive, display it in the Maintain Chart of Accounts window, select the Inactive
check box, and click the Save button.
When you make an account inactive, you make it eligible for deletion when
you purge. See Chapter 17 for information on purging.
Identifying the rounding account
Peachtree can round numbers on financial statements to either whole dollars
or whole thousands of dollars. So, occasionally, when you prepare financial
statements, Peachtree needs round numbers. Also, Peachtree needs a place
to store the difference caused by rounding. Although the account can be any
account, Peachtree recommends that you use the Retained Earnings account.
To make sure that Peachtree uses the Retained Earnings account for round-
ing, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪General Ledger.
Peachtree displays the General Ledger Defaults dialog box (refer to
Figure 3-4).
2. Click the Rounding Account tab.
3. Confirm that Peachtree has selected the single account that you’ve
designated as Equity–Retained Earnings.
If necessary, click the magnifying glass next to the account number to
display the list. In the unlikely event that Peachtree chooses the wrong
account, change it.
4. Click OK.
Opening balances
The odds are good . . . very good . . . excellent, in fact, that you’ve been in
business for some time now and that you’re starting to use Peachtree after
you’ve done some business. In cases like these, you need to enter beginning
balances into Peachtree to represent the business that you conducted before
setting up your Peachtree company.
Timing the start of using Peachtree
And now is a good time to talk about timing. How do you know when you
should go live with Peachtree? Well, ideally, try to start using a new accounting
package on the first day of your accounting year — January 1, if your business
41
Chapter 3: Designing the Chart of Accounts

operates on a calendar year; otherwise, the first day of your fiscal year. If you
can’t wait that long, then start using Peachtree on the first day of a quarter.
And if you can’t start using Peachtree on the first day of a quarter, then start on
the first day of a month.
Why these target dates? Well, you have the least amount of setup work to do.
For example, if your business operates on a calendar year and you start using
Peachtree on January 1, you don’t need to enter any beginning balances for
payroll or any of your income or expense accounts because the balances of
these accounts start at zero on January 1. If you start at the beginning of a
quarter, and you’re willing to forego monthly reports preceding that quarter,
you can enter summarized information for preceding quarters. And, if you
start on the first day of a month, you don’t need to play catch-up for the
month — which you’d need to do if you’d started mid-month.
Where do you get the numbers?
If you’ve used some other accounting package, you can print an Income
Statement, Balance Sheet, and a Trial Balance as of the last month that you
intend to use that accounting package. You can use a combination of the
Balance Sheet and the Income Statement, or you can use the Trial Balance:
The numbers on these reports in your old software represent the beginning
balance numbers of your new Peachtree company.
If you’ve never used any other accounting package, contact your accountant.
Provide the date that you want to start your company and ask for a Trial
Balance, a Balance Sheet, and an Income Statement as of that date. Your
accountant probably can’t provide the information instantly, especially if you
want to start on January 1, and you ask for the information in December of the
prior year. Your accountant needs to prepare these reports after December 31
so that the reports include all your prior year transactions.
But don’t worry; you can start working in Peachtree without beginning bal-
ance numbers; in fact, you might as well start working in Peachtree without
beginning balance numbers. You just need to remember that year-to-date
reports aren’t accurate because they don’t show the entire picture until you
enter beginning balances.
Entering beginning balances
After you get the numbers, entering them into Peachtree isn’t difficult. If
you’re going to start using Peachtree at any time other than the beginning of
your business year, we suggest you use the alternative method described in
the next section. If you’re going to start using Peachtree at the beginning of
your business year (calendar or fiscal), we suggest that you use Peachtree’s
Chart of Accounts Beginning Balances or Prior Year Adjustments window to
enter beginning balances. Follow these steps:
42
Part I: Getting Started 

1. Choose Maintain➪Chart of Accounts to display the Maintain Chart of
Accounts window (refer back to Figure 3-5).
2. Click the Beginning Balances button to display the Select Period
dialog box.
3. Select the period from the list.
Until you have entered transactions, you can enter beginning balances in
Peachtree by month for the year preceding your first open year, for your
first open year, or for your second open year. If Period 1 for the company
is January 2007, Peachtree makes available each month in 2006, 2007,
and 2008; all balances prior to January 1, 2006, would be lumped
together into Before 1/1/06.
4. Click OK to display the Chart of Accounts Prior Year Adjustments
window (see Figure 3-7).
5. Using the numbers that you’ve gotten either from your old accounting
system’s Trial Balance or from your accountant, enter the balances for
each account.
If you have an unusual balance in an account (for example, your cash
balance is a negative instead of a positive balance), enter a negative
number for the account balance.
When you finish, the Net Income number at the bottom of the window
should represent your Net Income for the period. Look for the Net
Income at the bottom of your Income Statement.
6. Click OK to store your beginning balances.
You can find out more about posting transactions in Chapter 5 — and also in
Chapters 6 through 9.

Chapter 3: Designing the Chart of Accounts

An alternative method for entering beginning balances
If you start using Peachtree at any time other than the beginning of the busi-
ness year, we suggest that you enter one (or more) journal entries to repre-
sent your beginning balances rather than using Peachtree’s Chart of Accounts
Beginning Balances or Chart of Accounts Prior Year Adjustments window. We
find that using journal entries for midyear starts seems to be less confusing.
You’d enter the journal entries to provide balances as of the first day of the
first open month.
Because we’re trying to avoid using the d word and the c word this early in
the book (debits and credits), we save the discussion of journal entries for
Chapter 17.
The B word — Budgeting
Nobody likes to live on a budget, but for most of us, budgets are a sad fact of
life. In the business world, budgets can help you compare how your business
is actually doing to how you thought it would do.
You can create budgets for each account in Peachtree; you can then print
Budget vs. Actual reports to see how well you’re doing. Although we’d love to
walk you through the details on budgeting, space is limited. We know you’re a
pretty smart reader, so, here’s a synopsis.
44
Part I: Getting Started 
If you’re out of balance . . .
You know that you’re out of balance if the Trial
Balance number in Figure 3-7 is not zero. In this
case, Peachtree wants to post the difference to
an Equity–doesn’t close account called Beg.
Bal. Equity. This account doesn’t appear in the
Beginning Balances window, but it does appear
on financial statements, General Ledger reports,
and in the Chart of Accounts list. The chances
are good that you’re out of balance due to a
typing mistake; double-check the numbers that
you’ve entered and make sure you’ve entered
all the numbers.
If you still can’t find the mistake, you can click
through Peachtree’s warning and let it create
the Beg. Bal. Equity account. Your company is
then in balance, and you can safely proceed to
enter transactions. If you have to use this
workaround, you need to live with the Beg. Bal.
Equity account until you find the source of the
problem. You can then correct it by clicking the
Beginning Balances button in the Maintain
Chart of Accounts window. Peachtree displays
the Beginning Balances window if you haven’t
posted any transactions. If you have posted
transactions, Peachtree displays the Prior
Period Adjustment window, which looks and
operates just like the Beginning Balances
window. When the Beg. Bal. Equity account has
a zero balance, you can delete the account.

In Peachtree Premium, choose Maintain➪Budgets. In the Maintain Budgets
window that appears, select an Account ID for which you want to establish
budget numbers. Then fill in budget amounts for each month in the available
fiscal years. You can use the Adjust\Copy button to copy amounts from the
first month to all other months — and save yourself some typing — or to
copy amounts from one fiscal year to another. Click Save, select the next
account, and repeat the process. 
If you’re using any other edition of Peachtree, you open the Maintain Budgets
window by choosing Maintain➪Chart of Accounts. In the Maintain Chart of
Accounts window, click the Budgets tab. You can create budgets for three
years instead of two.

Setting Up the Background
Information
In This Chapter

 Choosing inventory preferences
B
efore you dive into the day-to-day stuff of managing your company’s
books, you need to set up preferences. Doing so will save you time
when performing daily tasks because Peachtree uses the default information
as a model whenever you create vendors, customers, employees, and inven-
tory items, produce statements, and enter transactions (purchase orders,
purchases, invoices, payroll checks, and so on). You can alter this global
information when a particular person or item requires something other than
the default.
Terminology alert: Peachtree switches back and forth between two terms
when referring to bills that vendors send you: a purchase and an invoice. For
the sake of clarity, we call vendor bills a purchase; invoices are the things
you send to customers so that you can get paid.
Setting Purchasing Preferences
“What kind of information do you supply for vendors?” you ask. Well, you set
up standard terms. Terms describe how long the vendor gives you to hold a bill
before you need to pay it and how you want Peachtree to respond if vendors
offer you a discount for paying early. You also identify the default account to
assign to most vendor bills and vendor discounts. And you specify how you
want Peachtree to age bills that you enter. Last, you can set up custom fields
for vendors to track information you specify about the people from whom you
buy goods or services.

Aging is the concept of holding onto a bill for a specified period of time
before you apply payment terms to it.
Peachtree applies these preferences to all vendors you create and all pur-
chases you enter. If a vendor or a transaction is unusual in some way, you
make a change to the specific vendor or transaction. Using standardized
information in this way saves you time because you need to change the stan-
dard information only for exceptions to the rule. And let’s face it — we all like
to save time. See Chapter 5 for information on setting up vendors.
Establishing default payment 
terms and accounts
Efficient bill paying is an art. You don’t want to pay your bills too early or too
late. For example, if your bank account earns interest, you don’t want to pay
a vendor’s bill too soon, because you lose interest from the bank. On the
other hand, if your vendor assesses late fees or finance charges for bills that
you don’t pay on time, you don’t want to pay a bill too late.
Using Peachtree’s Vendor Defaults dialog box, you can establish a typical set
of terms to use for most vendors. In Chapter 5, you can find out how to create
vendors and how Peachtree automatically assigns these default terms to
each vendor. You need to change terms only for those vendors who don’t use
the typical terms.
To set default payment terms and accounts that most vendors use, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Vendors to display the dialog
box shown in Figure 4-1.
Figure 4-1:

Vendor
Defaults
dialog box

settings for
vendors.

Part I: Getting Started 

2. From among the Standard Terms option buttons, choose the option
that best describes the terms most of your vendors offer you.
The terms shown in Figure 4-1 are 2% 10 Net 30, which means you can
discount the bill by 2 percent if you pay it within 10 days; otherwise, the
entire amount of the bill is due in 30 days.
3. Fill in the appropriate boxes to the right of the terms you select in
Step 2.
As you select an option button on the left, the boxes on the right
change. For example, if you choose C.O.D. (cash on delivery) or Prepaid,
only the Credit Limit box on the right remains available, because none of
the other boxes apply.
4. At the bottom of the Payment Terms tab, click the magnifying glass to
select the account that you use most often when you post purchases
from vendors.
If you don’t select an account, Peachtree will prompt you for an account
each time you create a new vendor.
5. In the Discount GL Account text box, select the account to which you
want Peachtree to post discounts that vendors give you for paying in
the specified time.
To select the account, type its account number or click the Lookup list
indicator (the magnifying glass) to the right of the account number to
display a list. In the list, highlight the account number and click OK.
6. Click OK to close the dialog box or leave it open to review additional
defaults in the sections that follow.
Keep two points in mind: First, you may never receive discounts from your
vendors, but Peachtree expects you to set up the account anyhow. Second,
you may want to increase the credit limit. If you exceed the credit limit when
buying from a vendor, you can still buy from the vendor, but you see an
annoying message telling you that you’ve exceeded the credit limit.
Aging vendor bills
When you age a bill, you hold onto it for a specified period of time before you
pay it. You can age purchases (that is, you can tell Peachtree to count the
number of days you hold the bill) from either the billing date or the due date.
To set account aging defaults, choose Maintain➪Default Information➪
Vendors. On the Account Aging tab, select a method to age bills: Invoice Date
or Due Date. Optionally, you can change the number of days in each of the
four columns on the Aged Payables report.
49
Chapter 4: Setting Up the Background Information

You may find the difference between the two aging methods easier to under-
stand if you take a look at two Aged Payables reports, each prepared using
one of the aging methods. In Figure 4-2, we set the Aging option to Due Date
and then prepared a customized Accounts Payable Aging report for only one
vendor, Akerson Wholesale Nursery, as of March 31, 2007. In Figure 4-3, we
switched the Aging Option to Invoice Date and printed the same report for
the same vendor and time frame. (Note that invoice here refers to bills your
vendors send you.)
Both reports show four outstanding bills for Akerson Wholesale Nursery.
Each bill, along with its date and due date, is listed on a separate line.

Part I: Getting Started 

Notice the third bill — the one for $5,962.50. It was posted as of February 1,
2007, with terms of Net 30; the bill is due 30 days from the bill date of February
1 — on March 3. On the first report, the bill appears to be somewhere between
0 and 30 days old, while on the second report, it appears to be somewhere
between 31 and 60 days old. In actuality, according to the first report, on March
31, 2007, the bill is somewhere between 0 and 30 days past the due date of the
bill. According to the second report, on March 31, 2007, the bill is somewhere
between 31 and 60 days past the invoice date of the bill.
This report is not showing you what is past due; it is showing you the bill’s
age based on the number of days past either the due date or the invoice date.
Many people choose to age vendor bills by Due Date because the bills look
“less overdue” on the aging report.
Creating custom fields for vendors
Custom fields are a great way to store information about your vendors that
doesn’t fit elsewhere in Peachtree, such as details specific to your business
or industry. For example, many businesses track a workers compensation
certificate number for subcontractors to justify not covering the subcontrac-
tor on the company’s workers compensation insurance. On the Custom Fields
tab of the Vendor Defaults dialog box, you can create up to five fields for each
vendor. Check a box and, in the Field Labels boxes, type identifying labels for
the information you want to store.
When you set up vendors, you can fill in this information for each vendor.
(See Chapter 5 for more information on creating or editing vendor informa-
tion.) On some reports in Peachtree, you can print this information.
1099 Settings
On the 1099 Settings tab, you can, if necessary, change the way that Peachtree
calculates 1099 payments. For each account on the Chart of Accounts, you
can identify whether and how Peachtree should calculate 1099 income. By
default, Peachtree assumes that you will establish the correct 1099 type for
each vendor when you create the vendor, so each account is set up to look 
at the vendor’s record. You can, however, specify that a particular account
should be used to calculate 1099 miscellaneous income, 1099 interest income,
or you can specify that the account should not be used when calculating 1099
income. In most cases, you don’t need to change the default settings.
51
Chapter 4: Setting Up the Background Information

Setting Sales Preferences
“What kind of information do you supply for customers?” you ask. Well, you
set up standard terms for customers like you do for vendors. Only this time,
you’re the one establishing when payment is due and whether you offer cus-
tomers a discount for paying early. Customer terms also tell Peachtree how
to respond if customers pay early. You also identify the default sales account
and discount account where you want Peachtree to assign most customer
invoices. You specify how you want Peachtree to age invoices that you pre-
pare. As with vendors, you can set up custom fields for customers to track
specific information that may help you increase sales or offer perks. You also
can decide whether to charge your customers finance charges for overdue
invoices, and you can set their Pay Methods — cash, check, credit card, or
anything green.
The concept of aging applies also to invoices you send to your customers. In
this instance, aging refers to the specified period of time you allow before
you pay an invoice — and potentially charge the customer finance charges
for late payment.
As with vendors, Peachtree applies these preferences to all customers you
create and all invoices you enter. If a customer or a transaction is unusual in
some way, you can make a change to the specific customer or transaction.
Establishing default payment 
terms and accounts
When customers don’t pay you in a timely fashion, you may experience 
cash flow problems. That is, you have money going out of your business 
for expenses but not enough money coming in to cover those expenses. 
To encourage your customers to pay on time, you establish payment terms
similar to the ones your vendors set for you.
Using Peachtree’s Customer Defaults dialog box, you can establish a typical
set of terms to use for most customers. In Chapter 7, when you create cus-
tomers, you’ll see that Peachtree automatically assigns these default terms to
each customer. Change preferences for only those customers who don’t use
the typical terms.
To set default payment terms and accounts for most customers, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Customers to display the
Customer Defaults dialog box (see Figure 4-4).
52
Part I: Getting Started 

2. From among the Standard Terms option buttons, choose the option
that best describes the terms you offer most of your customers.
The terms shown in Figure 4-4 are 2% 10 Net EOM, which means your
customers can discount the invoice by 2 percent if they pay it within 10
days; otherwise, the entire amount of the invoice is due at the end of the
month. (EOM stands for end of month.)
3. Fill in the appropriate boxes to the right of the terms you selected in
Step 2.
The options for customer terms work like the options for vendor terms.
As you select an option button on the left, the boxes on the right
change. For example, if you choose C.O.D. or Prepaid, only the Credit
Limit box on the right remains available because none of the other
boxes apply.
You can use the Credit Status list to control Peachtree’s behavior in rela-
tion to the customer’s credit limit when you enter an invoice. The list con-
tains five choices. On one end of the spectrum, you can record invoices
without seeing any messages, regardless of the relationship between the
customer’s balance and credit limit. On the other end of the spectrum,
Peachtree will not allow you to enter an invoice for a customer regardless
of the relationship between the customer’s balance and credit limit. In
between these choices, you can have Peachtree display a warning or an
error message when a transaction will cause a customer’s balance to
exceed the credit limit. And you can have Peachtree display a warning
whenever you record a transaction for a customer who owes you money
even if the customer’s balance doesn’t exceed his or her credit limit.
4. Select the GL Sales Account that you use most often when you sell
goods or services to customers.
Figure 4-4:
Use the
Customer

53
Chapter 4: Setting Up the Background Information

To select the account, type the account number or click the Lookup list
identifier (the magnifying glass) to the right of the account number to
display and select from a lookup list. If you don’t select an account,
Peachtree will prompt you for an account each time you create a new
customer.
5. Select the Discount GL Account you use to track discounts taken by
customers.
6. When you’ve finished setting payment preferences, click OK to save
those preferences.
Even if you never offer discounts to your customers, Peachtree expects you
to set up the account anyhow. (If you haven’t set up a discount general ledger
account, see Chapter 3 for information on creating accounts.)
Aging customer invoices
We talk about aging a lot in our society, and now you’re getting a whole new
picture of wrinkled bills and invoices. Just as you can control the aging process
for vendor bills, you can age customer invoices from either the invoice date or
the due date.
Accounts receivable aging works the same as accounts payable aging — that
is, you can choose to age by due date or by invoice date. Suppose that you
post an invoice as of February 20, 2007, with terms of 2% 10, Net 30 Days.
If you set up accounts receivable aging to age by due date, the invoice is due 30
days from the invoice date of February 20, which is March 22. On the Accounts
Receivable Aging report, the invoice appears to be somewhere between 0 and
30 days old — that is, on March 31, 2007, the invoice is somewhere between 0
and 30 days past the due date of the invoice.
Alternatively, if you set up accounts receivable aging to age by invoice date, 
the same invoice appears on the Accounts Receivable Aging report to be some-
where between 31 and 60 days old. That is, on March 31, 2007, the invoice is
somewhere between 31 and 60 days past the invoice date of the invoice.
This report is not showing you what is past due; it is showing you the age of
invoices based on the number of days past either the due date or the invoice
date.
Many people choose to age customer invoices by invoice date because the
aging report then reflects how old the invoice is. Others prefer to age invoices
by due date so that they can see how many days the invoice is overdue.
54
Part I: Getting Started 

Creating custom fields for customers
In the Custom Fields tab of the Customer Defaults dialog box, you can enter
labels for up to five fields for each customer. Use these fields to store extra
information about customers, such as noting new customers who found your
business on the Web. Simply place a check in any Enabled box, and type the
descriptive text in the Field Labels box. When you set up customers, you can
fill in this information for each customer. On some reports in Peachtree, you
can print this information.
Suppose that you’ve established a label and filled in information for cus-
tomers. If you reopen the Customer Defaults dialog box and change the labels,
you won’t affect the information you stored for each customer; you must edit
each customer’s record and make a change to match the new label you’ve
established. If you simply don’t want to show the information you’ve already
entered, you can hide the stored information by removing the check mark
from the Enabled check box in the Customer Defaults dialog box. However, the
information reappears if you enable the custom field once again.
Setting up finance charges
Finance charges are fees you charge customers who pay late. Many busi-
nesses don’t charge finance charges; others believe that finance charges
encourage customers to pay on time and therefore improve cash flow. Still
others believe that charging these fees is necessary if customers continu-
ously ignore payment terms.
If you want to be able to charge finance charges, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Customers and click the
Finance Charges tab of the Customer Defaults box. 
2. Place a check mark in the Charge Finance Charges box. 
3. Complete the remaining information to tell Peachtree how to calcu-
late finance charges.
Peachtree charges an interest rate that you specify on invoices that are
overdue by the number of days you specify. You can charge a higher rate
on balances that exceed an amount you specify, specify a minimum
finance charge amount.
4. Optionally, check the Charge Interest On Finance Charges box. 
5. Use the Lookup list indicator to select a G/L account for finance
charges.
55
Chapter 4: Setting Up the Background Information

6. From the Appears On Invoices and Statements As list box, select the
description for the finance charge (either Late Charge or Finance
Charge). 
7. Optionally, provide a warning message that Peachtree can print on
invoices. 
8. Click OK. 
This information becomes part of your standard terms.
Placing a check mark in the Charge Interest on Finance Charges check box
tells Peachtree to calculate interest on any unpaid balance as well as unpaid
finance charges. Check with your accountant before you check this box; in
some states, it is illegal to charge interest on interest. Also, enabling finance
charges does not make Peachtree automatically assess finance charges. And
you don’t need to assign finance charges to all of your customers. See
Chapter 8 for information on assessing finance charges.
The Finance Charge Warning message at the bottom of the Finance Charges
tab is printed on the bottom of invoices you send to customers. If you’re not
charging finance charges, you may want to change the message to something
like “Happy Holidays” or “See our exhibit at the Business Expo March 16–19.”
Establishing payment methods
Pay methods are exactly what they sound like — the various methods of pay-
ment that your company accepts. You establish these default settings on the
Pay Methods tab of the Customer Defaults dialog box. Choose Maintain➪
Default Information➪Customers and click the Pay Methods tab. Then, in the
boxes provided, type the names of the payment methods your company
accepts.
These payment methods are available when you record payments you receive
from customers. You can include the Payment Method field on reports. For
example, you can add this field to the Cash Receipts journal and filter the jour-
nal to see only transactions of a particular pay method.
Adding a new payment method after you’ve already recorded transactions in
Peachtree doesn’t affect previously recorded transactions. The new payment
method is simply available for new transactions.
On the Pay Methods tab, you also can tell Peachtree to automatically assign
Deposit Ticket IDs in either the Receipts window or in the Select for Deposit
window. Deposit Ticket IDs help you group payments you receive from cus-
tomers. To help you reconcile your bank statement, you typically use the
same Deposit Ticket ID for all customer payments that you plan to deposit in
the bank at the same time. See Chapter 8 for more information on recording
receipts and using Deposit Ticket IDs.

Part I: Getting Started 

Setting Payroll Preferences
To correctly set up and use payroll in Peachtree, you need to identify some
basic information, such as the state where your company operates. But under-
standing payroll is difficult even when you aren’t worried about setting up pay-
roll in an accounting program. On the “good news” front, Peachtree uses a
wizard to walk you through establishing the defaults for preparing payroll
checks and tax-related forms (W-2s, Federal Form 940, and Federal Form 941).
Peachtree doesn’t prepare most state tax forms, but Chapter 9 shows you how
to use Peachtree payroll reports to find the information you need to complete
the forms.
Using the Payroll Setup Wizard
The Payroll Setup Wizard helps you set up basic information about payroll,
including payroll fields that Peachtree then uses to calculate payroll checks.
Payroll fields are things such as gross wages and federal income tax (FIT) —
one of those many mysterious abbreviations that appear on your payroll
check stub. Chapter 19 describes how to set up a payroll field for some
common payroll deductions (or additions — for those lucky enough to get a
bonus) that you want to include on a paycheck.
Peachtree Software Company does not ship tax tables that calculate federal
taxes with the software. To subscribe to Peachtree’s Payroll Tax Table Update
service, call 1-800-336-1420 Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. east-
ern standard time. You can use the Payroll Setup Wizard to help you set up pay-
roll when you first create a company or later, after you’ve been using Peachtree
for awhile. No problem — take your choice. In the paragraphs that follow, we
show you how to use the wizard to set up basic payroll information.
The Payroll Setup Wizard also can be useful after you’ve set up payroll. For
example, suppose that your company didn’t have a 401(k) plan when you orig-
inally set up payroll but later decided to add one. The Payroll Setup Wizard
makes implementing this change easy. Similarly, you can set up payroll and
then decide to track vacation and sick leave. See Chapter 19 for information
on setting up a 401(k) plan and tracking both vacation and sick leave.
To start the Payroll Setup Wizard, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Payroll Setup Wizard.
The first screen of the Payroll Setup Wizard lists the options you’re
going to set: general ledger accounts, standard payroll fields (taxes and
so on), and optional payroll fields.

2. Click Next.
You see the version number of the current global tax table installed on
your computer. Peachtree uses tax tables to make calculations related 
to payroll. The most obvious tax tables calculate the amount of tax to
deduct for FIT, FICA, Medicare, and Federal Unemployment Taxes (FUTA).
To determine whether your tax tables are up-to-date, visit Peachtree’s
Web site at www.peachtree.com. Click the link for Tax Service, select
the Peachtree product you’re using, and then click the View Tax Update
Version History link. Look through this Web page and compare your tax
table version to the latest available.
3. Click Next.
A screen appears for specifying the primary state to receive your payroll
taxes, the applicable percentage in the Unemployment Percent for Your
Company, and whether you want to record meals and tips for employees.
When you enter rates into Peachtree, you must express them as percent-
ages, but many state forms express rates in decimals. For example, sup-
pose the state form shows that your unemployment rate is 0.008. That’s
a decimal. To express it as a percentage (0.8%), you’d type 0.8 into
Peachtree. Yeah, entering these numbers requires that high school math
stuff, where you have to divide a decimal by 100 to get the percentage
equivalent. Yeah, yeah, yeah. . . .
Depending on the state you select, Peachtree may ask you for a Locality
and Locality Rate.
If you choose to record meals and tips, Peachtree tracks the amounts for
reporting and tax calculation, but it won’t post any entries to the general
ledger. For more information on recording meals and tips, refer to IRS
Publication 15, Circular E, Employer’s Tax Guide. You can download a
copy of Circular E at the Web site of the IRS:
www.irs.gov/formspubs/index.html
See Chapter 21 to find out about more stuff you can find on the Web.
4. Click Next to select general ledger accounts to use for payroll (see
Figure 4-5).
If you based the Chart Of Accounts on one of the standard companies
when you created your company, Peachtree suggests payroll accounts.
If you don’t have payroll accounts set up, you can define them on the fly.
Click the lookup list button next to each account box to display a list of
existing accounts. Click the New button to create new accounts while
still using the Payroll Setup Wizard. Refer to Chapter 3 for information
on setting up accounts.

Part I: Getting Started 

Some people create separate payroll liability accounts for each payroll
tax liability. To make your life easier using Peachtree, we recommend
that you create payroll liability accounts that correspond to the taxing
authority you pay. For example, you pay FIT, FICA, and Medicare to the
same taxing authority, so set up only one payroll liability account for all
three taxes. If you pay state and local taxes to the same taxing authority,
set up only one liability account for both taxes. Check with your accoun-
tant if you are unsure. We recommend this approach because it makes
writing your payroll tax liability checks easier.
5. Click Next four times to skip setting up the optional payroll fields and
see the payroll fields you created.
At this point, you’ve finished the basic setup for payroll; the remaining
choices in the Payroll Setup Wizard enable you to set up payroll fields
for a 401(k) Plan, vacation tracking, and sick leave tracking.
6. Click Finish.
Establishing general employee defaults
Once you run the Payroll Setup Wizard, you can change the payroll 
settings from the Employee Defaults dialog box (choose Maintain➪Default
Information➪Employees). You can use the General tab to change your state
or set a locality if necessary and to establish custom fields for storing miscel-
laneous information about each employee. To make a custom field available,
place a check mark in the Enabled box next to the field.
Peachtree automatically assigns payroll fields to the various boxes on the 
W-2 form, employee-paid taxes, or employer-paid taxes. You can, however,
edit the assignments by clicking the appropriate button in the Assign Payroll
Fields For section.
Figure 4-5:
Identify your
payroll
accounts.

Chapter 4: Setting Up the Background Information

Setting pay levels
Pay levels are names you set for various types of hourly and salary pay. Choose
Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees and click the Pay Levels tab. By
default, Peachtree automatically establishes the pay levels that appear on the
tab. Hourly wage pay levels appear on the left, and salary pay levels appear on
the right.
You can create up to 20 hourly pay levels and 20 salary pay levels, and you
can assign different pay levels to different general ledger accounts. Just type
the name for the pay level in the Field Name list and assign the pay level to a
G/L account.
You can override these defaults as necessary when you set up your employ-
ees. For example, suppose that you need to keep track of wages by depart-
ment. You can set the default G/L account to the department with the largest
number of employees and then, on individual employee records, change it to
the appropriate department G/L account as necessary.
To make your general ledger and income statement more meaningful, your
accountant may want you to use a different set of pay levels, pointing some
or all to different general ledger accounts. For example, you can use pay
levels based on your worker’s compensation categories as one method of let-
ting Peachtree help you determine your worker’s compensation liability.
Employee fields and employer fields
Peachtree categorizes the payroll fields created by the Payroll Setup Wizard
into employee-related fields or employer-related fields. On the EmployEE
Fields tab (see Figure 4-6), you see payroll fields belonging to employees.
These include gross wages, FIT, and the employee’s share of FICA and
Medicare. On the EmployER Fields tab, you can view payroll fields paid by
the company, including FUTA, state unemployment taxes, and the employer’s
share of FICA and Medicare. You can see the general ledger account and pay-
roll tax table Peachtree associated with each of the fields.
On the EmployEE Fields tab, you can do the following:
 Change the G/L account for a payroll field.
 Change the tax table Peachtree uses to calculate a particular payroll
field. Click in the Tax Name column to display a Lookup list indicator
that enables you to choose from a list of available tax tables.
 Place a check in the Memo column next to a field, such as Tips, to tell
Peachtree to calculate that field without updating your general ledger or
including the amounts in employees’ pay; note that Peachtree can use
fields marked as memos to calculate taxes. 
100 235

Part I: Getting Started 

 Place a check in the Run column next to a field to tell Peachtree not to
set the balance for this field to zero at the end of the payroll year. For
example, if you allow your employees to retain unused vacation from
year to year, set up your Vacation field with a check in the Run box.
 For fields Peachtree calculates, you can click the Adjust button to iden-
tify the fields you want Peachtree to add when calculating Adjusted Gross
Wages for the field. For example, you may want Adjusted Gross Wages to
include gross wages, FICA, and Medicare, but not FIT when calculating an
auto expense deduction.
 For fields Peachtree doesn’t calculate using a tax table, you can supply
a default amount. For example, if most employees pay the same amount
for medical insurance, you can type that amount in the Amount column,
and on the individual employee’s records, supply the appropriate
amount for employees who don’t pay the standard amount.
If you’re entering an amount you want deducted, enter it as a negative
amount.
Although you are allowed to edit the names of payroll fields, don’t change the
name of a payroll field and don’t change the order of the payroll fields after
you’ve entered payroll transactions. You’ll get inaccurate information on the
payroll earnings reports and W-2 forms. We recommend that you retain the
names of payroll fields Peachtree creates for you because they are often used
in payroll tax tables.
On the EmployER Fields tab, you can set these preferences:
 Change the general ledger liability and expense accounts for a payroll
field.
 Change the tax table Peachtree uses to calculate a particular payroll
field. Click in the Tax Name column to display the Lookup list indicator
and then select from a list of available tax tables.
Figure 4-6:
On the
EmployEE
tab, you

employees.

Chapter 4: Setting Up the Background Information

 For fields Peachtree calculates, you can click the Adjust button to iden-
tify the fields you want Peachtree to include when determining Adjusted
Gross Wages for the field.
The same warning applies to EmployER field names that applied to EmployEE
field names. Don’t change the name of a payroll field and don’t change the order
of the payroll fields after you’ve entered payroll transactions. These alterations
create inaccurate information on the payroll earnings reports and W-2 forms.
And the names of payroll fields are often used in payroll tax tables.
Setting Inventory Preferences
Before you start filling your virtual shelves in Peachtree, you need to set up
the preferences that help track all those wonderful items as they come and
go. Inventory items in Peachtree terms are typically anything that you buy
from vendors or sell to customers. It’s important to understand that
Peachtree inventory items do not necessarily have to be things that you keep
on hand or that add value to the balance sheet; the item class of the inven-
tory item determines whether it adds value to your balance sheet. In the sec-
tion “Inventory items and general ledger accounts,” later in this chapter, you
read about item classes.
You can set preferences for inventory items using the Inventory Item Defaults
dialog box, which you open by choosing Maintain➪Default Information➪
Inventory Items. The dialog box contains six tabs. On the General tab, you
can specify whether to permit duplicate values in the UPC/SKU field of inven-
tory items. Read on to find out about the other defaults you can set.
Inventory items and ordering defaults
The Ordering tab of the Inventory Item Defaults dialog box, shown in Figure
4-7, helps you control issues related to, well, ordering inventory items. For
example, you can choose to have Peachtree include items on purchase
orders when it calculates the quantity available. 
You can have Peachtree warn you when you’re entering a sales order, an
invoice, or a receipt for an inventory item that is out of stock based on the
quantity on hand or the quantity available. 
In the last section of the Ordering tab, you can enable the auto-creation of
purchase orders for drop-ship transactions and non-drop-ship transactions.
62
Part I: Getting Started 

When you enable real-time posting and assign a preferred vendor to each
inventory item, Peachtree will automatically create purchase orders for you
when you convert a drop-ship quote to a sales order, a drop-ship quote to an
invoice, or when you enter a drop-ship sales order or a drop-ship invoice con-
taining inventory items. 
If your transactions are not drop-ship transactions, you can have Peachtree
automatically create purchase orders for you when the quantity of an item
you specify causes the quantity available as of the transaction date to fall
below the minimum stock levels you set for the item. Again, for this feature 
to work, you must enable real-time posting and assign a preferred vendor 
to each inventory item.
Inventory items and general 
ledger accounts
Peachtree uses item classes to organize inventory items. You assign each
inventory item to a class when you create the item. And you can choose the
various accounts affected by inventory items in each of these item classes.
For stock, master stock, and assembly items, you can also choose an inven-
tory method. Chapter 11 includes information on how to create inventory
items.
For the purpose of setting defaults, remember that an item’s class determines
how Peachtree records the cost of the item.
Figure 4-7:
Use the
Ordering 
tab to set
ordering
defaults. 
63
Chapter 4: Setting Up the Background Information

Peachtree Premium supports 11 item classes, Peachtree Complete supports 9
item classes, and the other versions support 7 item classes. These item
classes follow:
 Stock: For inventory items that you track for quantities, average costs,
vendors, low stock points, and so on.
When you’ve assigned an item to the Stock class, you can’t change the
item’s class.
 Master Stock: For items that consist of information shared by a number
of substock items. For example, you might sell blue jeans, which consist
of a number of attributes, such as size and style (straight leg, relaxed fit,
classic fit, and so on.) After you create a master stock item and define its
attributes, Peachtree automatically generates substock items based on
the attributes of the master stock item. 
 Serialized Stock: Available only in Peachtree Premium accounting, use
this item class when the inventory items have serial numbers that you
plan to track.
 Nonstock: For items that you sell but do not put into your inventory,
such as service contracts. Peachtree prints quantities, descriptions, and
unit prices on invoices but doesn’t track quantities on hand. You can
assign a cost of sales G/L account, but it is not affected by a costing
method.
 Description only: When you track nothing but the description. For
example, you can add comments to sales or purchase transactions using
description-only items.
 Service: For services you can apply to your G/L salary and wages
account to bill a customer for services provided by your employees.
 Labor: For third-party labor costs that you pass on to a customer. You
can apply these costs to your G/L salary and wages account.
 Assembly: For items that consist of components that must be built or
dismantled.
 Serialized Assembly: Available only in Peachtree Premium, use this item
class for assembly items that also have serial numbers.
 Activity: Available only in Peachtree Premium and Peachtree Complete,
for recording, using Peachtree’s Time & Billing feature, how time is spent
when performing services for a customer or job.
 Charge: Available only in Peachtree Premium and Peachtree Complete,
for recording, using Peachtree’s Time & Billing feature, the expenses of
an employee or vendor when working for a customer or job.

See Chapter 10 for more information on Peachtree’s Time & Billing feature.
Follow these steps to set or review the account assignments for the inventory
item classes:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Inventory Items to display the
Inventory Item Defaults dialog box.
2. Click the GL Accts/Costing tab.
3. Move the mouse pointer over any white box to see the Lookup list
mouse pointer (arrow + ?), and then click to display the Lookup list
button, as shown in Figure 4-8.
4. Click the Lookup list indicator (the magnifying glass) to display a list
of your available accounts.
5. Highlight the account you want to use and then click OK.
6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 as necessary in any white box on this screen
to change an Item Class assignment.
For the Costing column, choose FIFO, LIFO, or Average as your costing
method.
Check with your accountant to help choose the correct method for your
business. Just so you know what we’re talking about, turn to the sidebar
in Chapter 11.
7. If necessary, change the GL Freight Account using Steps 3,4, and 5.
You use the GL Freight Account to assign freight charges to an invoice.

Chapter 4: Setting Up the Background Information

Taxes and shipping
Ah, taxes. The government needs to get its cut when you sell something —
and so, when appropriate, you must collect sales tax and pass it on to your
state’s taxing agency. As you would expect with anything connected with
then government, sales taxes are not straightforward. The government
requires that you charge tax on some things but not other things. To take that
concept a step further, some organizations (notably governmental and chari-
table agencies) don’t pay taxes. And, of course, it’s up to you, the seller, to
keep straight who pays tax and for what.
If necessary, choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Inventory Items to dis-
play the Inventory Item Defaults dialog box. Click the Taxes/Shipping tab. On
the left side of the Taxes/Shipping tab, you can define up to 25 tax types (you
have our sympathy if you need all of them). You use tax types to organize the
sales taxes that you remit and report to your state sales tax agency. Typically,
you want to set up tax types that match the categories you must report on
your state’s sales tax return. 
After you establish tax types, you assign a tax type to each inventory item 
you create — see Chapter 11 for more information. When you sell the item,
Peachtree will note the tax type, and when you pay your sales tax, you use a
report that segregates your sales by tax type. So that’s why you want to set up
tax types that match the categories you report on your state sales tax return.
See Chapter 7 for information on setting up sales taxes and Chapter 6 for infor-
mation on paying sales taxes.
You also can use the right side of the Taxes/Shipping tab to create up to 10
shipping methods. Remember that shipping methods don’t have anything to
do with inventory items; you assign shipping methods to customers and ven-
dors. The shipping methods you assign will appear on quotes, sales orders,
invoices, purchases, and purchase orders. Find out more about setting up
vendors in Chapter 5 and setting up customers in Chapter 7.
Custom fields
Although you don’t assign shipping methods to inventory items, you may
assign custom fields to inventory items — notes, alternate vendors, and
weight are a few examples of the type of information you might store in
custom fields. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Inventory and click the
Custom Fields tab. Place a check mark in the Enabled box next to each
custom field that you want to use and then type the name of the custom field
in the Field Labels box.
66
Part I: Getting Started 

Price levels
Peachtree Premium and Peachtree Complete support multiple prices — price
levels, so to speak — for inventory items. You can set up to 10 price levels 
for each inventory item, assigning an easy-to-remember level name such as
Retail, Wholesale, and Discount5 (for Discounted 5%), and then use the vari-
ous price levels to establish pricing schemes. For example, you might estab-
lish Price Level 1 as your full retail price, Price Level 2 as a 5% discount off
the retail price, and Price Level 3 as a 10% discount off the retail price. You
start by identifying which of the 10 price levels you want to use on the Price
Levels tab of the Inventory Item Defaults dialog box, shown in Figure 4-9. To
use a price level, place a check mark in the Enabled column next to the price
level. 
You also can set default price calculations for each price level. The calculation
can be based on the last cost of an item or on Price Level 1. After selecting the
basis for the calculation, you can increase or decrease the price by either a
percentage or an amount. You set default price calculations by clicking the
button in the Edit column next to the appropriate price level. Peachtree dis-
plays the Default Price Level Calculation dialog box, shown in Figure 4-10. 
Figure 4-10:
Use this
dialog box to
establish a
calculation
for a price
level.
Figure 4-9:
Identify the
price levels
you want to
use by

the Enabled
box.
67
Chapter 4: Setting Up the Background Information

The calculations you establish in the Inventory Item Defaults dialog box are
defaults for all items. You also can establish selling prices for each individual
item by using the Maintain Inventory Items window. Any prices you establish
for an individual item override prices you set in the Inventory Item Defaults
box. See Chapter 11 for details.
The Price level feature in Peachtree is powerful. Even after you establish
defaults and then override them by setting price levels for individual items,
you can override individual item price levels on invoices as you create them.
See Chapter 7 for more information.
Peachtree also enables you to assign price levels directly to customers; sup-
pose, for example, that you always discount all merchandise for a particular
customer to Price Level 3. In the Maintain Customers/Prospects window, you
can assign a customer to Price Level 3 so that all items on all invoices for the
customer default to Price Level 3. Again, see Chapter 7 for more information.
You’re probably wondering about how to change prices — after all, nothing
stays the same price forever (unfortunately). Yes, you can easily raise (or
lower, if you are so inclined) prices without editing individual items. See
Chapter 11 for more information.
Setting Preferences for Printing
Statements and Invoices
Just as you can set defaults for the way you want Peachtree to handle your
customers, vendors, and employees, you also can control the information
printed on statements and invoices. You set these preferences by choosing
Maintain➪Default Information➪Statement/Invoices.
Suppose, for example, that you don’t use preprinted invoices or statements
but that you want your company’s name, address, and phone numbers to
appear on the top of the invoice or statement. In the Statement/Invoices
Defaults box, shown in Figure 4-11, simply place a check mark in the last
check box to print your company’s name, address, and phone numbers, as
they appear in the Maintain Company Information window.
Use the rest of the boxes on the Statement Print Options tab to control the
customers selected when Peachtree prints statements:
 If you place a check mark in the Any activity since the last statement
was printed check box, Peachtree will print a statement for any cus-
tomer who has purchased something from you since the last time you
printed statements. 
68
Part I: Getting Started 

 If you place a check mark in the Balances at least check box and supply
a minimum balance number, Peachtree will print statements for cus-
tomers with balances equal to or greater than the minimum balance. 
 If you place a check mark in the At least one invoice X days past due
check box and then type a number of days overdue, Peachtree will print
statements for any customers who have an invoice overdue by at least
the number of days you entered. 
 Place a check mark in the Negative balances box to specify whether
Peachtree should print statements for customers with credit balances —
the people to whom you owe money. You can choose Always, Never, or
Only when the above options apply. 
 Place a check mark in the Zero balance box to specify whether
Peachtree should print statements for customers whose balance is 0.
You can choose Always, Never, or Only when the preceding options
apply.
Strangely enough, each of these check boxes is a yes-or-no question, but the
check boxes in this section of the dialog box work together. If a customer
meets any condition that you have checked, Peachtree will print a statement.
For example, suppose that you place a check mark in the Any Activity Since
The Last Statement Was Printed box and also in the Balances At Least check
box and you supply $1.00 as the minimum balance. Peachtree will print state-
ments for all customers who have bought something from you and all cus-
tomers whose balance is greater than $1.00. So, even if you did not want
customers with 0 balances, Peachtree will print statements for those cus-
tomers if they have bought something and paid for it. Be sure to examine the
logic of all the boxes you choose to check.
Figure 4-11:

box to

information

Chapter 4: Setting Up the Background Information

Peachtree can print balance forward statements, similar to the way informa-
tion appears on a MasterCard or Visa credit card bill, where an invoice
appears only once on a statement and its balance subsequently becomes
part of the Previous Balance line. Or Peachtree can print open item state-
ments, where all outstanding invoices — the ones that aren’t paid in full —
appear on the statement.
Using the Dunning Messages tab, you can specify four messages that may
appear on statements. The message that appears on a particular statement
depends on the length of time a customer’s account is overdue. In addition to
entering the message, you also can enter the number of days the account is
overdue.

In this part, we show you how to keep up with tasks
including billing your customers and collecting money
from them, purchasing and paying for goods and services
used in your business, and paying employees. We also

uying things is part of the business of doing business. Some businesses
buy goods from vendors and keep them in inventory to resell to cus-
tomers. Some businesses buy goods to use in the manufacturing of a product
to sell to customers. And all businesses buy the goods and services that they
use to stay in business, such as office supplies and utilities.
So, no matter how you look at it, you can expect to receive bills in the mail.
And, of course, paying bills isn’t fun, but at least Peachtree can make the
process easier and save you time — time you can spend earning more money.
This chapter describes the typical actions you take to record and track ven-
dors’ bills.
Terminology alert: Peachtree tends to switch back and forth between two dif-
ferent terms when referring to bills that vendors send you: a purchase and an
invoice. For the sake of clarity, we call it a purchase unless the screen calls it
an invoice. For our purposes, invoices are things you send to customers so
that you can get paid.
Working with Vendors
If you buy goods or services from a particular vendor on a regular basis, you
can save time in the long run if you set up that vendor in Peachtree. In fact, if

you don’t set up the vendor, you’ll find it difficult to track how much you’ve
spent with that vendor. There . . . you have two good reasons to set up ven-
dors with whom you do business on a regular basis.
Adding vendors
When you set up a vendor, you supply name and address information, a pur-
chase account to use each time you post a purchase from the vendor, and
custom field information. You also can view historical information about your
purchases from the vendor for the previous 12 months.
To add a new vendor, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Vendors to display the Maintain Vendors window,
as shown in Figure 5-1.
2. Fill in the Vendor ID and the Name text boxes.
The ID is the number you use to select the vendor when you want to
post a purchase or payment, so try to make it meaningful. The ID can be
up to 20 characters and numbers long, and it is case sensitive. We sug-
gest that you use lowercase letters so that you can type the ID quickly.
By default, Peachtree sorts the vendor list and reports using the Vendor
ID. To get Peachtree to sort the vendor list in alphabetical order by
default, use characters from the vendor’s name as the ID.
3. On the General tab, fill in contact information — your account number
with the vendor and the vendor’s address and phone numbers.
Figure 5-1:
Use this
window to
add, edit, or
delete
vendors.
74
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

The account number you supply appears by default on checks you print
from the Payment window. Find out more about the Payment window in
Chapter 6.
4. If appropriate, identify the vendor’s 1099 type by selecting an option
from the 1099 Type drop-down list.
According to IRS rules, you must issue a 1099 to a vendor who is an inde-
pendent contractor if the contractor is not incorporated and you pay
$600 or more per year to that vendor. Peachtree can print 1099s at the
end of the year for vendors you designate as 1099 vendors. Sales repre-
sentatives might be considered 1099 vendors, based on the IRS defini-
tion of employees and independent contractors. If you have Peachtree
Complete or Premium, you can filter several of Peachtree’s reports by
1099 Type; see Chapter 14 for more information on printing and filtering
reports. See Chapter 9 for more discussion on paying sales representa-
tives who are also employees.
5. Use the Vendor Type text box to group similar vendors together.
For example, you may want to distinguish between vendors who supply
you with inventory and vendors who provide overhead services such as
telephone. The text you enter in the Vendor Type text box can be up to
eight characters long; note that this field is case sensitive. Entering a
vendor type is useful because you can limit some reports to specific
vendor types.
6. If appropriate, supply an e-mail and a Web address for the vendor.
Both e-mail and Web addresses are interactive. So, if you supply an e-mail
address and click the icon next to the E-mail text box, Peachtree opens
your e-mail program and starts a message to the vendor. Similarly, click-
ing the button next to the Web Site text box launches your browser and
directs it to the vendor’s Web site.
To generate e-mail messages from within Peachtree, you must have a
MAPI-compliant, default e-mail application installed on your computer. If
your default e-mail system is AOL, you will not be able to send e-mail
alerts from Peachtree because AOL is not a fully MAPI-compliant e-mail
application.
7. Click the Beginning Balances button to display the Vendor Beginning
Balances window, where you can enter unpaid bills you received
from vendors before you started using Peachtree.
Technically, you can enter as many beginning balance bills as you want for
an individual vendor; however, if you exceed 100 bills, you can enter but
not edit or delete any information for the 101st bill and subsequent bills.
If you click the Current Balance button, Peachtree displays the Vendor
Ledger report for the current vendor, showing you the bills and checks
that comprise the vendor’s balance as of the specified date.

8. Click the Purchase Defaults tab to select a default purchase rep,
account, terms, and form delivery options for the vendor.
An employee can serve as a purchase representative.
You need to select a default Purchase Account and terms only if they
differ for the vendor you’re creating from the default account and terms
you established in the Vendor Defaults dialog box. (See Chapter 4 for
details on global default purchase settings.)
In the Form Delivery Options area, you can choose to e-mail forms (such
as purchase orders) to vendors or print them and mail them. If you select
the E-mail option, you can choose to e-mail a copy of the form to the pur-
chase representative at the same time that you e-mail the form to the
vendor.
9. If the vendor is a 1099 vendor, supply the vendor’s Tax ID number,
which eventually appears on the 1099.
10. Select a shipping method from the Ship Via drop-down list.
Peachtree creates most of the shipping methods that appear in the Ship
Via drop-down list when you create your company; you can add to or
change these methods when you set up defaults for inventory. You can
find information on setting up inventory defaults in Chapter 4.
11. To change the terms for the vendor, click the Terms button.
Peachtree displays the Vendor Terms dialog box (see Figure 5-2). Deselect
the Use Standard Terms check box and set up the vendor’s terms.

Vendor Default dialog box.
13. Click the Save button to save the vendor information.
Changing vendor information
You can change any information you have entered about a vendor, including
the vendor ID. If you need to make a change to a vendor’s information, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Vendors.
2. Type a few letters of the vendor’s ID — remember, ID’s are case-
sensitive — or click the lookup list box indicator next to the Vendor 
ID text box to display a list of vendors.
3. Highlight the vendor you want to change and click OK.
The information you saved previously for the vendor appears.
4. If you need to change the vendor ID, display the vendor’s information
in the Maintain Vendors window and then click the Change ID toolbar
button.
Peachtree displays the Change Vendor ID dialog box. Type a new ID in
the New Vendor ID text box and click OK. Peachtree changes the
vendor’s ID.
5. Click the tab containing any additional information you want to
change.
6. Make the change(s).
7. Click the Save button.
Viewing vendor history
After you have recorded purchases and payments for vendors, Peachtree
tracks these transactions by month. Choose Maintain➪Vendors to open the
Maintain Vendors window. Type the Vendor ID or highlight your choice from
the lookup list and then click the History tab to view a history of your activ-
ity with the vendor.

Chapter 5: Buying Goods

“De-activating” a vendor
If a vendor has gone out of business or you’ve decided that you just don’t
want to do business with a particular vendor, you can change the vendor’s
status to inactive. After you make a vendor record inactive, Peachtree dis-
plays a warning if you try to buy something from the vendor.
Although you see a Delete button in the Maintain Vendor window, you can’t
delete a vendor unless no transactions exist for the vendor. You know, you
put somebody in and then realized you didn’t want them after all — and you
didn’t record any transactions. Then you can display that vendor on-screen
and click Delete. Otherwise, to get rid of a vendor, you must first make the
vendor inactive. After closing a fiscal year, you can purge inactive vendors so
that they don’t appear in lookup lists. See Chapter 17 for information on clos-
ing a fiscal year and purging.
To make a vendor inactive, follow these steps.
1. Choose Maintain➪Vendors to open the Maintain Vendors window.
2. In the Vendor ID text box, select the vendor you want to make inactive.
3. When the vendor appears on-screen, select the Inactive check box and
then click the Save button. The vendor is now inactive.
When you need to reactivate the vendor, deselect the Inactive check box.
An inactive vendor won’t appear in the lookup lists if you decided to hide
inactive records when you set Peachtree’s global options. You can find out
how to hide inactive records in Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site.
Working with Purchase Orders
A purchase order is a document you use to request merchandise from a vendor.
When you enter a purchase order, Peachtree doesn’t actually affect any of your
accounts — that doesn’t happen until you either receive the merchandise or, if
you’re using cash basis accounting, when you pay the vendor.
Peachtree takes note of the transactions — that is, you can print reports that
show you the accounts that the purchase orders will affect when they are
filled. But the purchase orders don’t actually update the accounts when you
save the purchase orders.
78
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Entering purchase orders
“If a purchase order doesn’t affect any of my accounts, why use it?” you ask.
Well, first, you don’t need to use purchase orders; Peachtree operates correctly
if you don’t use them. But most people use purchase orders as reminders, par-
ticularly when ordering inventory, because the purchase order shows the
items they’ve ordered but not yet received. Others use purchase orders for
non-inventory items such as office supplies or contract labor to help track
expected expenses.
Purchase orders provide you with a great way of remaining organized so that
nothing slips through the cracks. You can use the Purchase Order report to
help you stay on top of things.
You can’t enter purchase orders in Peachtree unless you have set up a vendor,
but you can set up a vendor while working in the Purchase Orders window.
To enter a purchase order, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Purchase Orders to display the Purchase Orders
window, as shown in Figure 5-3.
You can customize the appearance of the Purchase Order window to
better suit your needs; if you have changed these settings, your window
won’t look exactly the same as the window you see in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3:
A typical

79
Chapter 5: Buying Goods

2. Type the vendor’s ID in the Vendor ID text box or click the lookup list
box selector to display the list of vendors.
If the vendor exists, Peachtree fills in the vendor’s name and the Remit
To address. Your company’s name also appears in the Ship To address
box. You can see the vendor’s current balance as of the system date, and
you can click the button next to the balance to display a Vendor Ledger
report of the purchases and payments that comprise the balance.
If you need to add a vendor, click the lookup list selector and then click
the New button on the toolbar. Peachtree displays the Maintain Vendors
window. Refer to the earlier section in this chapter, “Adding vendors.”
Close the Maintain Vendors window to return to the Purchase Orders
window.
3. In the PO No. text box, type a number for the purchase order if you
don’t intend to print it but just want to save it or if you intend to print
it later.
If you intend to print the purchase order, leave the PO No. box blank, and
Peachtree supplies a sequential purchase order number when you print
the purchase order.
You can’t use the same purchase order number more than once for a
particular vendor. You can reuse a purchase order number as long as
you assign it to a different vendor.
4. If necessary, change the date of the purchase order.
5. Enter a date in the Good Thru text box — the date after which the pur-
chase order should not be filled.
6. If necessary, change the shipping method in the Ship Via drop-down
list.
While you can change the A/P account, typically, you don’t. Although
Peachtree doesn’t affect any of your accounts when you post the pur-
chase order, later, when you receive merchandise against the purchase
order, Peachtree uses the account information on the purchase order to
update your company’s books.
7. In the Quantity text box, type the quantity you want to order.
For a whole number such as three, type 3.0. If you set global options to
Automatic Decimal Entry and you type simply 3, Peachtree assumes you
want .03.
8. Click in the Item box.
The Lookup list box appears so that you can select the item you want to
order from the existing inventory items. Peachtree fills in the item
80
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

description, the general ledger account associated with the item, the
item’s unit price, and the amount (unit price times quantity).
Read about setting up inventory items in Chapter 11. If you want to order
something that you haven’t set up as an inventory item, skip the Item box
and fill in the Description, GL Account, and Unit Price text boxes. Peach-
tree calculates the amount. If you enabled Peachtree’s spell-checking
options (see Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site for more informa-
tion), Peachtree flags any spelling mistakes as they happen.
9. Click in the Job box to display the Lookup list box selector and
choose a job from the list.
If you’re purchasing a Stock item or an Assembly item, you cannot assign
it to a job; however, if you’re purchasing any other type of item, you can
assign it to a job. You also can assign the line to a job if you don’t select
any item from the Item list. Chapter 12 covers setting up and assigning
types of jobs.
10. Repeat Steps 7 through 9 for each item you want to order from this
vendor.
11. Click either the Save button or the Print button.
If you want to continue entering purchase orders and print them later in
a group, click the Save button. Otherwise, click the Print button. To print
your purchase orders in a group, see the section about printing forms in
Chapter 14.
You can preview the purchase order before you print it by clicking the drop-
down arrow on the Print button and selecting Preview.
But there’s an easier way . . .
This feature is available only in Peachtree Premium and Peachtree Complete.
In Chapter 4, where we discuss setting up inventory options, you have the
choice to enable auto-creation of purchase orders for drop ship and non-drop
ship transactions. If you enable these options and enable real-time posting,
you can let Peachtree generate purchase orders for you, based on informa-
tion you supplied when you defined your inventory items (see Chapter 11 for
details on inventory items).
To make this feature work, you need to assign a preferred vendor to each
inventory item and, to make the feature work well, you need to supply a mini-
mum stock quantity and a reorder quantity for each inventory item.
81
Chapter 5: Buying Goods

Assuming that you’ve done these things, choose Tasks➪Select for Purchase
Orders. The Select for Purchase Orders dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 5-4.
In the Select For Purchase Orders dialog box, you set up the selection criteria
that Peachtree should use to display a list of potential purchase orders to
create.
In the Select Items With section of the dialog box, you can choose which items
to include using the Item ID, Item Type, and Item Class options. For example, in
the sample company, you can select the All option for the Item ID, the SUPPLY
option for the Item Type, and the Stock option of the Item Class.
In the And Items With section, you can narrow the selection by choosing only
certain vendors or buyers (buyers are set up as employees and you identified
buyers as well as vendors when you created inventory items).
In the Display a List of Items section, you can indicate that you want Peachtree
to select items to order based on the how many items are available or on hand
by selecting the Quantity Available or the Quantity On Hand options as of a
particular date; you can also order based on as the item’s minimum stock level.
In the And Set Order Quantity To section, you can identify the quantity you
want Peachtree to place on the purchase order(s) it suggests.
When you click OK, Peachtree displays the Select For Purchase Orders window
shown in Figure 5-5, where you can review the proposed purchase orders and,
if necessary, exclude any you don’t want Peachtree to create by deselecting the
check box in the Order column of the proposed purchase order.

You can make changes to the purchase orders before Peachtree creates them;
click in the appropriate column and make your change. For example, you can
select a different vendor or change the Order Qty or GL Account.
After you identify the purchases you want to create, you can preview them 
as they will appear to the vendor by clicking the drop-down arrow on the
Print button and selecting Preview. If you want a hard copy of the Select For
Purchase Orders window, click the drop-down arrow on the Print button and
select Report.
To create a purchase, click the Save button; if you prefer, you can click the
Print button or the E-mail button. If you click the Print button, Peachtree
prints the purchase order and asks you to confirm that it printed properly. 
If you click Yes, Peachtree saves the purchase order. If you click the E-mail
button, Peachtree displays a dialog box where you can assign a purchase
order number; when you click OK, Peachtree displays the e-mail message it
will send to the vendor (see Figure 5-6), including the purchase order in PDF
format. After you review the message, Peachtree again displays a dialog box
that asks you to confirm that the purchase e-mailed properly. If you click Yes,
Peachtree saves the purchase order.
After you produce a purchase from the Select For Purchase Orders window,
you can click the Refresh button on the toolbar; Peachtree updates the infor-
mation in the Quantity on POs column.

Editing and erasing purchase orders
You can change purchase orders, and you can delete purchase orders.
Although good accounting practices say you shouldn’t ever delete anything,
because a purchase order doesn’t affect your accounts, the offense doesn’t
seem quite so serious.
You can change or remove items from purchase orders if you have not yet
received the items. If you know you’ll never receive the items, you can close
the purchase order. If the purchase order was simply a mistake and you have
not received any items listed on it, why not just erase it? To edit or delete a
purchase order, choose Tasks➪Purchase Orders to display the Purchase
Orders window. Then click the Open button to display the Select Purchase
Order dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-7.
The Select Purchase Order dialog box shows, by default, the period in which
you are working. In Figure 5-7, you see the purchase orders entered with March
(Period 3) dates. If you don’t see the purchase order you want to edit or
delete, open the Show list box and select an earlier period.
You can edit any purchase order, whether it is open or closed. Look for the Y
in the Open? Column of the Select Purchase Order dialog box. If the Open?
column is blank, the purchase order is closed, meaning all the goods have
been received and entered, or you got tired of waiting and canceled it.

Select a purchase order to view and click OK to display the purchase order in
the Purchase Orders window. You can make any of the following modifica-
tions to the purchase order:
 Change the date entered in the Date or the Good Thru text boxes.
 Select a different shipping method from the Ship Via drop-down list,
enter a new amount in the Discount Amount text box, change displayed
terms in the Terms text box, or change the account number in the A/P
Account text box.
 Adjust the quantity you ordered on any line of the purchase order —
even a line you’ve already received. Find out how to receive items you
order in the section, “Receiving goods against a purchase order,” later in
this chapter.
 Remove any line if you have not received those items. Click anywhere in
the line you want to delete and click the Remove button.
 Close the purchase order by selecting the Close PO check box that
appears immediately below the PO No. text box.
You cannot delete a purchase order if you have received any of the items
listed on the purchase order; the Delete button appears grayed out (unavail-
able). If you know you’ll never receive items remaining on a purchase order,
close the purchase order.

Chapter 5: Buying Goods

Entering Bills
Scenario: A vendor with whom you do business on a regular basis sends you
a bill. (Peachtree uses the terms purchase and invoice interchangeably to rep-
resent a vendor bill.) You don’t want to pay the bill immediately, but you do
want to pay the bill in a timely manner. So, enter the bill into Peachtree as a
purchase, and Peachtree tracks the bill’s age so that you pay it A) when it’s
still eligible for a discount and B) before the vendor charges you a late fee.
Do you receive a bill on a regular basis from a vendor? Chapter 6 shows you
how to create a recurring purchase or payment for things like monthly utility
bills or lease payments.
Purchasing without using a purchase order
Unlike purchase orders, purchases update your company’s accounts. When-
ever any transaction updates your company’s books, at least two accounts
are affected because of the double-entry bookkeeping concept.
Every purchase you enter automatically updates Accounts Payable. The other
account Peachtree updates depends on whether you record a bill for an inven-
tory item. If you select inventory items in the Purchases/Receive Inventory
window, you tell Peachtree to update inventory for the other side of the trans-
action. If you don’t select an inventory item, then you probably select an
expense account, such as your telephone expense account. In that case,
Peachtree updates Accounts Payable and the expense account.
Peachtree assumes that you wouldn’t enter a bill from a vendor for merchan-
dise without having first received the merchandise—and entering a bill for
merchandise does update quantities on hand, so, don’t enter a bill until you
receive the goods. You might, however, receive the goods without yet receiv-
ing the bill. In this second case, you enter a purchase and make sure that you
check the Waiting on Bill box.
If you’re curious about the accounts Peachtree is updating (yes, debiting and
crediting), Chapter 17 shows you a neat way to find out what Peachtree is
doing.
Peachtree assumes that you wouldn’t bother to enter a bill from a vendor you
use only occasionally; instead, you’d just pay that bill. Therefore, you can’t
enter purchases in Peachtree unless you have set up a vendor. For one-time
or occasional purchases from vendors you don’t expect to use often, use the
Payments window to pay the bill directly. See Chapter 6 for more information
on paying bills.
86
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

To enter a purchase (a vendor’s bill) that doesn’t reference a purchase order,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Purchases/Receive Inventory to display the Purchases/
Receive Inventory window (see Figure 5-8).
You can customize the appearance of the Purchases/Receive Inventory
window to better suit your needs; if you do, the window won’t look 
the same as the window you see in Figure 5-8.
2. Enter the vendor’s ID in the Vendor ID text box or click the lookup list
box and select a vendor from the list.
After you select a vendor, Peachtree fills in the vendor’s name and Remit
To address. Your company’s name also appears in the Ship To address
box. You can see the vendor’s current balance as of the system date, and
you can click the button next to the balance to display a Vendor Ledger
report of the purchases and payment that comprise the balance.
If you have previously entered purchase orders for this vendor, Peachtree
displays the Apply to Purchase Order tab. If you want to receive goods
against one of these POs, skip to the next section.
3. In the Invoice No. text box, type a number for the vendor’s bill.
You can’t use an invoice number more than once for a particular vendor.
You can reuse an invoice number as long as you assign it to a different
vendor.
Figure 5-8:
Use this
window to

87
Chapter 5: Buying Goods

4. If necessary, change the date of the purchase.
Yes, you can change the A/P account, but typically, you don’t.
5. In the Quantity text box, type the quantity for which you’re being
billed.
For a whole number such as three, type 3.0. If you set global options to
Automatic Decimal Entry and you type simply 3, Peachtree assumes you
want .03.
6. You have two options for entering items that appear on the bill:
• If you are recording a bill for an item that you haven’t set up as an
inventory item, skip the Item text box and just fill in the Description,
a GL Account, and Unit Price boxes. If you enabled Peachtree’s spell-
checking options (see Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site for
more information), Peachtree flags any spelling mistakes as they
happen.
• If you are recording a bill for an inventory item, select the item in
the Item list box. Peachtree fills in the Description, GL Account, the
Unit Price, and the Amount (unit price times quantity) boxes.
7. If you are purchasing a serialized item, click the Serial No. button to dis-
play the Serial Number Entry dialog box shown in Figure 5-9, where
you can add the serial numbers you are purchasing.
Type the serial number for the first item and click Add. Repeat the
process for each serialized item you are purchasing. If the serial num-
bers are consecutive, select the Add consecutive serial numbers check
box and specify the number of items you are purchasing. When you
finish, click OK.

8. Click in the Job text box to display the lookup list button and choose
a job from the list.
If you’re purchasing a stock item or an assembly item (serialized or unse-
rialized for Peachtree Premium users), you cannot assign it to a job.
However, if you’re purchasing any other type of item, you can assign it to
a job. You can also assign the line to a job if you don’t select an item from
the Item list. You can read about setting up jobs in Chapter 12.
If you assign a line to a job, Peachtree allows you to include it on a cus-
tomer’s bill as a reimbursable expense. Chapter 12 covers information
about including reimbursable expenses on customer invoices.
9. Repeat Steps 5 through 8 for each item you want to order or that
appears by the bill you’re recording.
10. Click the Save button to save the transaction.
Receiving goods against a purchase order
Scenario: You ordered merchandise using a purchase order, and the mer-
chandise arrives. Maybe the bill comes with the merchandise, and maybe it
doesn’t. Either way, you need to update your company’s accounts to reflect
the receipt of the merchandise so that you know they’re available to sell.
You use the Purchases/Receive Inventory window to receive goods against a
purchase order. You can, simultaneously, indicate whether you received the
bill. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Purchases/Receive Inventory to display the Purchases/
Receive Inventory window.
2. Type the vendor ID in the Vendor ID text box or click that handy mag-
nifying glass to display the list of vendors.
After you select a vendor, Peachtree fills in the vendor’s and Remit To
address. Your company’s name also appears in the Ship To address box.
You can see the vendor’s current balance as of the system date, and you
can click the button next to the balance to display a Vendor Ledger
report of the purchases and payment that comprise the balance.
If you have previously entered purchase orders for this vendor,
Peachtree displays the Apply to Purchase Order tab, and the window
looks like the one shown in Figure 5-10.
3. In the Invoice No. text box, type a number for the vendor’s bill.
You can’t use an invoice number more than once for a particular vendor,
so if you get stopped by this, be sure you haven’t got an old invoice.
89
Chapter 5: Buying Goods

If you have vendors who don’t provide you with an invoice number, your
company might have a standard solution for this problem like entering a
combination of the vendor ID plus the date or the primary PO number.
This usually helps avoid duplications (but not always).
4. If necessary, change the date of the purchase.
5. If only the merchandise arrived but you have no bill from the vendor,
select the Waiting on Bill check box.
If you received both goods and a bill, leave the box deselected.
As with other transactions, you can change the A/P account, but typi-
cally, you don’t.
6. On the Apply to Purchase Order No. tab, click the Apply to Purchase
Order No. drop-down list, select the PO number that lists the goods
you ordered.
Peachtree fills in the lines that appear on the purchase order.
7. On each line of the Apply to Purchase Order tab, in the Received text
box, type the quantity you received.
If you are purchasing a serialized item, click the Serial No. button to add
the serial numbers you are purchasing. In the Serial Number Entry box
that appears, type the serial number for the first item and click Add.
Repeat the process for each serialized item you are purchasing. If the
serial numbers are consecutive, select the Add consecutive serial num-
bers check box and specify the number of items you are purchasing.
When you finish, click OK.

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Remember that you have to put the decimal-zero after the whole number,
or Peachtree adds the leading decimal: To get 6, type 6.0. Peachtree fills in
the Amount text box by multiplying the unit price by the quantity.
8. Click the Save button to save your work.
When the bill arrives . . . finally
If you have entered vendor receipts against a purchase order but didn’t have
a bill at the time you entered the vendor receipts, you should have selected
the Waiting on Bill check box in the Purchases/Receive Inventory window.
When the waiting is over and you’ve got the vendor’s bill, follow these steps
to tie up the loose ends:
1. Choose Tasks➪Purchases/Receive Inventory to open the Purchases/
Receive Inventory window.
2. Click the Open button to display the Select Purchase dialog box.
If you select the vendor first, Peachtree alerts you that a bill already
exists for this vendor.
3. From the Sort By drop-down list, select ID to sort the list by vendor
name.
4. Find the vendor’s name in the Vendor Name column, and then look
for a Y in the Waiting? column and Unpaid in the Status column.
Use the Reference column to further help you identify the correct 
purchase.
5. Highlight the correct purchase and click OK.
Peachtree displays the purchase in the Purchases/Receive Inventory
window.
6. Deselect the Waiting on Bill check box.
7. Click the Save button.
By making this status change, you indicate to Peachtree that you now consider
the bill eligible for payment. See Chapter 6 for information on paying bills.
Shipping Directly to Customers
Suppose that you need to buy something, maybe a special order for a cus-
tomer, and you want to ship it directly to the customer. No problem. You can
91
Chapter 5: Buying Goods

specify a customer’s address in the Ship To box on either a purchase order or
a purchase. Choose Tasks➪Purchase Orders to display the Purchase Orders
window or Tasks➪Purchases/Receive Inventory to make a purchase. In either
window, follow these steps:
1. Type the vendor ID in the Vendor ID text box or click the lookup list
box selector to display the list of vendors.
2. Select the Drop Ship check box.
Peachtree displays a Customer ID field next to the Vendor ID field.
3. Select the customer from the Customer ID list.
Peachtree supplies the customer’s address and enables you to select a
different shipping address if you click the Ship To drop-down list arrow.
You can type the recipient’s name and address if you haven’t set the
recipient up in the Customer List.
4. If you have already entered an invoice to the customer, you can enter
the invoice number in the Customer Invoice No. text box. If you’ve
entered a sales order but not an invoice, enter the sales order number
in the Customer SO No. text box.
Both of these text boxes are informational only; they don’t tie to invoice
or sales order transactions. You’ll find them most useful, however, if you
enter numbers that represent real transactions because they can help
you track drop shipments on reports.
You don’t need to create the invoice before you set up the drop ship-
ment, but don’t forget to bill your customer. For more information about
creating invoices for customers, see Chapter 7.
5. Click the Save button.
To help you track drop shipments, you can add the Drop Shipment, Customer
ID, Customer SO No., and Customer Invoice No. fields to the Purchase
Journal, the Purchase Order Journal, and the Purchase Order report. You also
can filter the Purchase Order report so that it displays only drop shipments
created in the Purchase Orders window.
Entering Credits
Suppose that you have a purchase that you no longer need. Should you just
erase it? If you want to practice good accounting, the answer is a definite no.
Deleting purchases removes the audit trail — that thing accountants mean
when they talk about the list of transactions you enter because your business
does business. When accountants can trace transactions from beginning to
end, they’re really happy campers.
92
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Having said that, you need to understand that Peachtree allows you to delete
any unpaid purchase, even though your accountant won’t like it. Display the
purchase in the Purchases/Receive Inventory window and click the Delete
button.
But Peachtree won’t allow you to delete a purchase if you’ve applied any trans-
actions to it. Suppose, for example, that you accidentally paid a purchase that
you later determined you should not have paid. If you try to delete the pur-
chase, the Delete button in the Purchase window is unavailable. In this case,
you need to void the check you wrote that paid the purchase, and then you
need to enter a vendor credit memo in Peachtree to cancel the effects of the
purchase. (See Chapter 6 to find out how to void a check.) After you’ve voided
the check, follow the steps in this section to finish canceling the purchase.
Besides fixing errors in purchases, don’t forget about the times when a vendor
issues a credit memo to you for merchandise you return. You need to enter the
vendor credit memo into Peachtree to reduce the balance you owe the vendor
and match it to the original purchase. To record the vendor credit memo, use
the Vendor Credit Memos window. While you can enter a vendor credit memo
without having previously entered a purchase (you use the Apply to Purchases
tab of the Vendor Credit Memos window), typically you enter vendor credit
memos for existing purchases. In the following steps, we assume that you are
returning any merchandise for which you received a credit:
1. Choose Tasks➪Vendor Credit Memos to display the Vendor Credit
Memos window.
2. Enter the vendor’s ID in the Vendor ID text box.
After you select a vendor, Peachtree fills in the vendor’s name and Remit
To address. You can see the vendor’s current balance as of the system
date, and you can click the button next to the balance to display a Vendor
Ledger report of the purchases and payment that comprise the balance.
3. Enter a date in the Date text box, and then enter a credit number in
the Credit No. text box.
For the Credit No. text box, we suggest that you enter the original invoice
number followed by CM to indicate credit memo. This numbering scheme
helps you tie the credit memo to a particular purchase.
4. On the Apply to Invoice No. tab, click the Apply to Invoice No. drop-
down list, select the invoice number of the purchase for which you
are recording a credit memo.
Peachtree fills in the lines that appear on the purchase.
5. On each line of the Apply to Invoice No. tab, in the Returned text box,
type the quantity you want to return (see Figure 5-11).

Chapter 5: Buying Goods

If you plan to return everything, you can click drop-down list arrow on
the Return button and select All to have Peachtree fill in all the amounts
for you.
If you are returning a serialized item, click the Serial No. button to dis-
play the Serial Number Selection dialog box and identify the serial num-
bers you are returning. Select the check box next to the number(s) you
are returning and click OK.
If you are using Automatic Decimal Entry, remember that you have to put
the decimal-zero after the whole number, or Peachtree adds the leading
decimal: To get 9, type 9.0. Peachtree fills in the amount (unit price times
quantity).
6. Click the Save button to save the transaction.
Peachtree records the transaction; if you print your Aged Payables
report, you’ll see that the purchase no longer appears on the report.
If you aren’t applying the credit memo to an existing purchase, make sure
that the credit memo you enter on the Apply to Purchases tab of the Vendor
Credit Memos window mirrors the purchase you entered originally; that is,
the credit memo should affect the same things (vendor, general ledger
accounts, and inventory items) that the original purchase affected.

Paying Bills
In This Chapter
 Paying a group of bills
 Generating checks and reports
 Paying one bill at a time
 Creating recurring transactions
 Tracking payments and voided checks
 Remitting sales tax
A
lthough we wish things were different, the facts are simple: You can’t hold
those bills indefinitely . . . eventually, you have to pay them. If you prefer
to let the bills pile up awhile, you can enter them gradually and pay all bills due
by a certain date on your bill-paying day. Occasionally, you may need to pay
only one or two bills or write a check to cover an unexpected expense — you
know, the UPS person is standing there waiting for a check to cover the COD
package in your hand.
Peachtree helps you pay groups of bills all at once or pay individual bills on
the spur of the moment. You can make repetitive payments easily. And when
you have to void checks or pay sales tax on all those goods you’ve sold,
Peachtree helps you keep all the amounts in the right accounts.
Terminology alert: Peachtree tends to switch back and forth between two dif-
ferent terms when referring to bills that vendors send you: a purchase and an
invoice. For the sake of clarity, we use the term purchase (or bill) unless the
screen uses the term invoice. For our purposes, invoices are things you send
to customers so that you can get paid.

Paying a Group of Bills
Most people sit down on a regular basis — say every two weeks — and pay
all bills due by a certain date. They hold the bills that are due later until the
next bill-paying day. In Peachtree, you can select all bills due by a certain date,
or you can select bills for certain vendors or greater than an amount you
specify. Then you can simply tell Peachtree to write the checks and bid your
bundle good-bye.
Before you start paying your bills, you may want to print the Aged Payables
report and the Cash Requirements report to get a handle on the outstanding
purchases you’ve entered into Peachtree. (See Chapter 15 for information on
printing reports.) By reviewing these reports, you can determine whether you
need to pay a group of bills or just a few bills. To pay a group of bills, you use
Peachtree’s Select for Payment window. (To pay just a few bills or to pay a bill
from an occasional vendor that you don’t want to set up in Peachtree, see
“Paying One Bill at a Time,” later in this chapter.)
Using the Select for Payment window, Peachtree looks for purchases you’ve
entered that are eligible for payment based on criteria you provide. You can
use this window only to pay bills you’ve entered previously as purchases. (See
Chapter 5 for help entering bills.) To pay a group of bills, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Select for Payment.
The Select for Payment – Filter Selection dialog box appears, shown in
Figure 6-1.
Figure 6-1:
Select bills
to pay in the
Select for
Payment –
Filter
Selection
dialog box.
98
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

2. Set the Check Date.
Most people use today’s date.
You can enter just the month and the day; Peachtree automatically uses
the current year established by your computer’s clock. If you enter only
the day, Peachtree automatically uses the month and year established
by your computer’s clock.
3. Use the Invoices Due Before date to set a cut-off date for purchases
that you want to pay.
Peachtree does not select any purchases due after the date you enter in
this box.
Peachtree calculates the due date when you enter the bill by using the
terms you established for the vendor. So the due date typically is not the
same as the date you entered the bill and usually is 30 days later. We
suggest that you set the Invoices Due Before date equal to a date that
falls just before your next bill paying date. That way, you won’t be late
paying bills.
4. Set a date for the Or Discounts Lost By box if your vendors offer you
discounts for paying by a specified date.
If you don’t get vendor discounts, this date doesn’t matter.
5. In the Include Invoices section, select the range of invoices to include.
If you set dates in the preceding steps, you typically click the All Invoices
option. However, you can click the Only Invoices . . . Days Past Inv. Date
option and specify a number of days. In the With Balances Over box, you
can also filter the invoices to only those more than a specified amount.
6. In the Include Vendors section, make your choices regarding payees.
You may want to simply include All Vendors, but you can choose to
include a range of vendors by entering the Vendor ID in the From and To
boxes, or the Vendor Type in the Type Mask box, or both the ID and Type.
7. If you always take discounts offered by vendors — even if you’re
paying later than the discount date — place a check mark in the
Always Take Discounts Regardless of Due Date check box.
8. Click OK.
Peachtree displays the Select for Payment window you see in Figure 6-2,
displaying purchases that meet the criteria you just specified.
Peachtree initially displays the bills in Invoice Date order, but you can change
to Due Date order or Vendor order using the Sort By list box. Peachtree also
selects a cash account to use to pay the bills and a discount account to use
for any discounts you take, but you can select different accounts using the
Lookup list indicator (magnifying glass) next to the appropriate fields.
99
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

When the entire line for a bill appears gray, that entry is a purchase for which
you have not yet received a bill (the check mark remains in the Waiting for Bill
check box on the purchase). Peachtree won’t let you pay these purchases. If
you think the entry should be eligible for payment, close the Select for Pay-
ment window and edit the purchase to remove the check mark from the
Waiting for Bill box. See Chapter 5 for more information.
Peachtree assumes that you want to pay all the bills it displays, but you can
choose not to pay any bill by removing the check mark in the Pay column, as
we did in Figure 6-2. If you allow Peachtree to calculate balances automatically,
it updates the numbers that appear at the lower-right corner of the window.
If you don’t allow Peachtree to recalculate balances automatically, you see
Uncalculated in the lower-right corner of the window. You can recalculate bal-
ances in this window only by clicking the Recalc button ($). If you want to
recalculate balances in all windows, go to Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s
Web site.
On the toolbar at the top of the window, you can click the drop-down arrow
on the Print button and click Report to print a report of the bills you’ve
selected to pay. The report sorts the bills by vendor, as shown in Figure 6-3.
You also can preview the checks as they will look when they print if you click
the drop-down arrow on the Print button and select Preview.

The Print button also has a Postage option that you can use to buy postage
online at Stamps.com. Using Stamps.com requires software available on the
Peachtree CD-ROM or from Stamps.com. Stamps.com is a fee-based service
you can use to print postage from your computer.
If you highlight any line in the window and double-click or click the Detail
button, you can see but not edit the details for that line. Click the Select
button to change the bills you selected, and Peachtree redisplays the dialog
box your saw in Figure 6-1.
Printing Checks
As you would expect, Peachtree supports printing checks on your computer’s
printer. You must order check stock with the correct bank information on it.
You can order checks from Peachtree. Look for the check ordering informa-
tion inside the box with your Peachtree software, in Help (click the Contents
tab and open the Peachtree Products and Services book), or on Peachtree’s
Web site at www.peachtree.com.
You can also ask your local forms supplier if they have purchase check forms
that work with Peachtree and your printer.
Figure 6-3:

Chapter 6: Paying Bills

Whoever supplies your checks can also supply window envelopes. Using these
envelopes will save you time when paying bills because you won’t need to use
labels or address envelopes.
When you click the Print button in the Select for Payment window (see the
preceding section for details on displaying this window), Peachtree starts the
printing process. Follow these steps to complete the process:
1. Establish the starting check number.
Peachtree suggests a starting check number that you can change if Peach-
tree suggests an incorrect starting number. Peachtree assigns the starting
number to the first check you print and subsequent numbers to subse-
quent checks when Peachtree posts your checks. If you had numbers
preprinted on your check stock, make sure that the check(s) you print
and the check(s) Peachtree posts both use the same check numbers.
2. Select a check form from the Print dialog box.
The form should match the type of check form you purchased. You can
customize Peachtree’s forms; see Chapter 13.
On the check stub, most of Peachtree’s check forms print purchase
information such as the invoice number, date, and amount, but you can
print the details of the items you bought (each line item that appears on
the purchase) instead if you choose the OCR – MultiP AP 1 Stub Detail or
OCR – MultiP AP 2 Stub Detail form.
3. Choose the number of copies you want to print.
4. Click Print.
You can click the Practice button to print a practice check. On practice
checks, Peachtree prints a check filled with Xs and 9s that you can use
to determine if the form alignment is correct.
Peachtree prints the checks and a message appears on-screen asking if
the checks printed correctly. If you choose Yes, Peachtree assigns the
check numbers and posts the checks. If you choose No, Peachtree doesn’t
assign the check numbers or post the checks; you can print them again.
Paying One Bill at a Time
Occasionally, you need to write only one or two checks. You know, you went
to the office supply store and bought a box of copy paper, and you paid for it
with a check. Now you need to record the check. You certainly don’t want to
enter a purchase and then pay the purchase using the Select for Payment
window. To print or record a single check, use the Payments window. Essen-
tially, you use the Payments window in three situations:
102
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

 You don’t need to print a check — you just need to record that it was
written.
 You don’t have many checks to write.
 You need to write a miscellaneous check, like a refund check to a cus-
tomer or a loan check to an employee.
From the Payments window, you can print checks that pay bills, print checks
without first recording bills, or simply record checks you wrote manually. For
example, suppose that it’s bill-paying day and you have only two bills to pay.
Use the Payments window to print checks to pay the bills. Or, suppose that the
UPS guy is waiting for a check for a COD purchase. You can print the check
from the Payments window without first recording a purchase. Or, suppose
that you enter the telephone bill in the Purchases/Receive Inventory window,
intending to pay it on bill-paying day. Then you change your mind because
you’re going to be at the phone store anyhow, and you want to bring a check to
pay the bill. Use the Payments window to record the check you wrote manually.
You can use the Write Checks window to produce a single check, but do not
use this window to write a check that pays a bill. If you entered a bill for a
vendor, pay the bill by using either the Select to Pay window or the Payments
window. We’re not overly fond of the Write Checks window, because you won’t
see any warning if you select a vendor for whom a purchase exists, enabling
you to accidentally write a check to pay a bill without applying the check to
the bill. For this reason, we strongly recommend that you use either the
Select to Pay window to pay a group of bills or the Payments window to pay 
a few bills or write miscellaneous checks, and just ignore the existence of the
Write Checks window.
From the Payments window, you can pay vendors you’ve set up, or you can
write a check to someone you haven’t set up in Peachtree. You also can use
this window to issue an employee loan or (heaven forbid) write a refund
check to a customer. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Payments to display the Payments window.
2. Select a vendor or type a name in the Pay to the Order of box.
If the vendor doesn’t have any unpaid purchases, or if you don’t select a
vendor but instead type a name in the Pay to the Order of box, Peachtree
displays the Apply to Expenses tab shown in Figure 6-4. Fill in the quantity
and, if appropriate, select an item. If you don’t select an item, fill in the
description, supply the GL account if necessary, and type a unit price.
Peachtree calculates the amount. If appropriate, assign the line to a job.
You can include payments that you assign to jobs as reimbursable
expenses on customers’ bills. See Chapter 7 for more information.
103
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

If you select a vendor and the vendor has outstanding purchases,
Peachtree displays the Apply to Invoices tab, listing all unpaid pur-
chases for the vendor (see Figure 6-5). Place a check mark in the Pay
column next to all purchases you want to pay. Peachtree displays the
dollar amount on the check face.
You can partially pay the purchase by typing an amount in the Amount
Paid column on the line of the purchase you want to pay.
Figure 6-5:
If the 
vendor has
outstanding
bills, check
the ones
you want 
to pay.
Figure 6-4:

Payments
window to

104
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

You can display the purchase shown on any line. Double-click the pur-
chase, and Peachtree displays it in the Purchases/Receive Inventory
window where you can edit it.
3. If you don’t intend to print the check, type the Check Number.
For example, if you’re recording that check you wrote at the office supply
store for the box of copy paper, you have no reason to print the check, but
you must enter it. For this situation, enter the check number.
By default, Peachtree supplies a check number for any check you print. If
you enter a check number in the Payments window for a check you intend
to print, Peachtree prints the word Duplicate on the check face — and you
don’t want that to happen. Therefore, leave the check number blank if you
intend to print the check.
If you’re a Type A personality who insists on completing all empty boxes
on a screen, you can suppress the printing of the word Duplicate by cus-
tomizing the check form. See Chapter 13 for details.
4. At the top of the screen, supply a date for the check.
5. In the right column, select the Cash Account from which you want to
write the check.
6. Depending on whether you enter a check number in Step 4, continue
by clicking Save or Print.
If you included a number in the Check Number box, click the Save
button to save the check.
If you didn’t include a number in the Check Number box, click the Print
button to print the check immediately. Peachtree displays the Print Forms
dialog box, which we cover in the “Printing Checks” section earlier in this
chapter. Select Print; when you finish printing checks, Peachtree assigns
the check numbers and posts the checks.
If you prefer to keep working and print a batch of checks later, click Save to
post your checks without assigning check numbers to them. See Chapter 13
for details on printing checks in batches.
Editing Payments
From an accounting perspective, there’s little reason to edit a payment. In the
real world, however, you’ll come up with a reason — such as, you recorded
that check for office supplies and typed the wrong amount, which you noticed
when you were about to file the receipt. You edit payments the same way you
edit purchase orders and purchases, which we describe in Chapter 5. In the
105
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

Payments window, click the Open button to display the Select Payment
window, which lists all payments you recorded. Highlight the transaction you
want to edit and click OK. You also can erase checks. We talk more about that
in the section on voiding checks later in this chapter.
Handling Repeat Bills and Payments
Suppose that you pay a bill — such as your rent or your health insurance —
every month for the same amount. Peachtree lets you set up recurring 
purchases or payments. You enter the purchase or payment once and tell
Peachtree how often to record the transaction. Recurring transactions save
you data-entry time.
You set up recurring purchases and recurring payments in the same way; the
only difference is the window you use. To set up a recurring payment, start in
the Payments window.
Recurring transactions affect the general ledger. In accrual-basis companies,
both recurring purchases and recurring payments affect the general ledger. 
In cash-basis companies, only recurring payments affect the general ledger.
Therefore, if you enter a recurring transaction, Peachtree updates the general
ledger in the appropriate period; if you print future period reports, you will
see the effects of the transactions in those future period reports. As you would
expect, though, Peachtree displays each period’s balances accurately for that
period.
Use recurring purchases when you expect to print a check to pay a bill. If you
don’t expect to print a check — perhaps your health insurance company auto-
matically deducts its payment from your checking account — use recurring
payments.
To set up a recurring purchase, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Purchases/Receive Inventory to open the Purchases/
Receive Inventory window.
2. Set up the purchase (select the vendor, and so on), but don’t assign an
invoice number.
You may want to click the Waiting on Bill box so that you don’t acciden-
tally pay a future bill before it becomes due.
3. Click the Recur button on the toolbar.
Peachtree displays the Create Recurring Journal Entries dialog box (see
Figure 6-6). Don’t let the name scare you.
106
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

4. In the When to Recur list, select the frequency you want.
5. In the Number of Times box, type the number of transactions you want
to enter for the time frame you chose in Step 4.
For example, if you’re going to make a payment every week for 7 weeks,
choose Weekly from the When to Recur list and type 7 in the Number of
Times box. If you’re going to make the payment every month for one year,
choose Monthly in the When to Recur list and type 12 in the Number of
Times box.
You can create recurring purchases and payments that extend to the end
of the last open period, but not beyond. Peachtree allows you to have
two years open (usually 24 months).
6. In the Begin with # box, assign a starting number for the recurring
purchase.
If you want, set up a prefix for the bill. In Figure 6-6, we added the year
and a dash to the number to make Peachtree start each purchase it cre-
ates for this recurring transaction with 2007-. Peachtree adds an incre-
mental number, starting with 01. Because we created 12 transactions,
Peachtree numbers the last recurring purchase as 2007-12.
7. Click OK.
You can hear some activity on your hard disk while Peachtree creates
the transactions. Then Peachtree redisplays the Purchases/Receive
Inventory window, ready for you to enter your next purchase.
If you open a recurring purchase, take a minute to notice a couple of interest-
ing things:
 You can see multiple entries for the recurring transaction in the Select
Purchase window. For example, if on April 1 you set up the payment to
recur weekly for seven weeks, look for at least four or possibly five
entries in April. If you set up the purchase to recur monthly, you need to
use the Show list box in the Select Purchases window to display All
Transactions or a future period.
Figure 6-6:
Use this
dialog box
to set up
transactions
that happen
repeatedly.
107
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

 When you display the recurring purchase in the Purchases/Receive
Inventory window, look at the bottom of the window for an entry telling
you how many more entries exist.
 When you save an edit to any recurring transaction, Peachtree prompts
you to save the change for the current entry or the current entry and all
remaining entries.
 In the Payments window, when you select a vendor for whom you set up
a recurring purchase, you see lines for all recurring purchases, regard-
less of the period. Remember, you can double-click any line and view or
edit the purchase in the Purchases/Receive Inventory window.
 When you click the Edit button in the Payments window to display the
Select Payment window, recurring payments don’t have reference num-
bers like recurring purchases do. The Reference number for a payment
is the check number. Peachtree leaves the number blank so that you can
print a check for the payment. If you write the check by hand, edit the
payment and assign a check number.
Voiding Checks
If you write a check and then discover a problem with the check, you can void
it. When you void a check, Peachtree creates a negative check for the same
amount as the check you void, but the value of the voided check increases your
cash account — remember, the original check reduced your cash account. In
other words, if you add the two transactions, you get 0 (accountants say the
transactions “Net to 0”), and a $0 transaction causes no change in your cash
balance. The voided check transaction that Peachtree creates has the same
number as the original check, but Peachtree adds a V to the number; that is, if
you void check 101, Peachtree creates check 101V. You can view (and edit) the
voided check in the Payments window the same way you can view and edit any
other payment.
To void a check, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Void Checks to display the Void Existing Checks window
shown in Figure 6-7.
2. If necessary, click the lookup list indicator to choose the cash account
from which you wrote the check that you now want to void.
3. Enter the Void Date for the check.
Be sure this date falls in the period that you want the cash account
increased, which is not necessarily the same period that the check was
written.
108
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

4. Highlight the check you want to void and then click the Void button.
Peachtree displays a message asking whether you’re sure you want to
void the check.
5. Click OK, and Peachtree creates a voided check transaction.
You can sort the checks in the Void Existing Checks window in different ways
to help you find the check you want to void. Click any of the column headings
in the window to sort checks by that column heading.
If you accidentally void the wrong check, open the Payments window and click
the Edit button. You can find the voided check in the window — the check
number ends with a V for Void. Highlight that transaction and click OK to dis-
play it in the Payments window. Then delete it by clicking the Delete button.
After you void a check, you can see both the original check and the voided
check transaction in the Account Reconciliation window when you balance
your checkbook, and Peachtree has already marked them both as cleared.
For more information on balancing your checkbook, see Chapter 16.
When you void a check that paid a vendor bill, Peachtree reopens the vendor
bill. That is, Peachtree assumes you still want to pay the bill. If you do want
to pay the bill, simply use the Payments or the Select for Payment window. If,
however, you don’t want to pay the bill, enter a vendor credit memo for the
bill. Chapter 5 has more information on creating vendor credit memos.
Paying Sales Tax
Most states expect customers to pay a sales tax on goods they purchase; in
some states, customers also pay tax on services. In addition, the county or
local government may also assess a tax on customer’s purchases. If your
Figure 6-7:

window 
to identify

to void.
109
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

business sells taxable goods, you collect the sales tax for at least one taxing
authority. Then, of course, you’re expected to remit the sales tax to the taxing
authority — along with a sales tax return (so that they can make sure that
you’re not cheating them out of any of the sales taxes you collect).
Paying sales tax in Peachtree is no different than paying any other bill; you
can enter a purchase to remind yourself that you owe the money or you can
simply write the check. The tricky part? Finding out how much to pay because
not all sales are taxable in every state. And when the sales are taxable, local
taxes might apply as well. To complicate the issue further, if you operate your
business close to a border between jurisdictions, your business may be col-
lecting taxes for more than one jurisdiction — and at different rates.
If you set up your sales taxes correctly (see Chapter 7 for more information),
you can use the Taxable/Exempt Sales report (see Figure 6-8) to help you pre-
pare the sales tax return and remit your sales taxes. Select Reports➪Accounts
Receivable to print this report, which breaks down the taxes you owe by taxing
authority.
If you set up multiple exempt categories as described in the Inventory Prefer-
ences section Chapter 4, customize this report to add a column for the Tax
Type, as we did in Figure 6-8 so that the report lists and identifies the totals
for each exempt category that you need for the sales tax return. See Chap-
ter 14 for help customizing reports.

hat incredible assets we have in our customers! (Well, most of them
anyway.) After all, we wouldn’t be in business without them, would we?
Peachtree operates under the assumption that you might generate a quote to a
customer, convert that quote into a sales order, and then turn that sales order
into an invoice when you produce the goods or service. You do not, however,
have to use quotes or sales orders to use Peachtree’s invoicing feature.
Even if you don’t use quotes or sales orders, we suggest that you read this

orders, and invoices are almost identical. Therefore, to eliminate redundancy,
we explain most of the details in one place (see the section, “Bidding with
Quotes”). We show you the differences between entering quotes, sales
orders, and invoices in the individual sections of this chapter.
In addition to talking about the forms you use to sell things to your customers,
we’re going to start by talking about another important selling issue — sales
taxes.
Working with Sales Taxes
Everyone hates to pay sales tax; taxes make us feel like we’re paying more
for our purchase than we should. Like it or not, though, most states expect
customers to pay sales tax, usually on goods, but occasionally on services or
freight as well. If you run your business in a locality that charges sales taxes,
you, as the seller, are obligated to collect the sales tax from your customer.

Yielding to the authorities
If your business sells taxable goods or services, you collect the sales tax for
the taxing authority — that’s the term Peachtree uses to identify the agency
that has the right to tell you to collect sales tax from your customers. That
authority could be only your state government but frequently other local
agencies are involved as well.
For example, suppose that your state along with several counties in your
state charge a sales tax. In this case, you need to set up Sales Tax Authorities
for your state and for each county as well.
Most states base the tax amount on the total invoice amount, but some states
base their sales tax on the individual line item amount. Peachtree provides
the ability to calculate sales taxes using a variety of methods. Table 7-1 illus-
trates the different scenarios in which your state might calculate sales tax.
(Of course, if your state doesn’t have sales taxes . . . feel free to avoid this
table completely.)
Table 7-1 
Sales Tax Scenarios
Scenario
What It Does
Single tax rate
Applies the standard tax rate on all sales regardless of
amount.
Maximum dollar 
Applies the standard tax rate up to a ceiling amount. After 
sales 
that, no more tax is calculated. For example, if the tax is 3%
on the first $4000 of a sale and the sale is $5000, only $4000
is taxed at the 3% amount. The remaining $1000 is untaxed.
Minimum dollar 
Applies the standard tax rate only when sales reach a 
sales
specified amount. For example, if the minimum taxable sale
amount is $500, a sale of $450 it is not taxed.
Maximum dollar tax
Applies the standard tax rate until the tax reaches a 
maximum amount, and then no more tax is calculated on
that sale. For example, if the tax rate is 2%, with a maximum
dollar tax of $20, sales up to $1000 are taxed at the 2%
amount, but sales of $1000 and more are taxed a flat $20.
Maximum percent 
Applies the standard tax rate to a specific maximum 
sales amount
percentage, less than 100%. For example, the tax rate might
be 3% but it applies only to 75% of the sales price.
Each taxable line 
Calculates the tax rates on each line item, instead of 
item
applying the previous tax rates to the grand total of the order.

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Suppose that your business is located in the state of Georgia and that the state
charges 4 percent sales tax for goods up to $999.99 and 3.5 percent sales tax for
sales $1000.00 and over. You pay the tax to the Georgia Department of Revenue.
If you have a branch of your business located in Brown County, Georgia, which
has its own local tax, you have to charge those customers the additional local
tax — say, 2 percent — which, in turn you pay to the Brown County Treasurer’s
office. If another branch is located in Green County, Georgia, another locality
with a tax, the customers at that store have to pay an additional, say, 2.5 per-
cent, which you turn over to the Green County Treasurer’s office. In this situa-
tion, you have three taxing authorities: the State of Georgia, Brown County, and
Green County.
What if you pay two or more of your taxes to the same payee? What authori-
ties should you create? In that situation, you still should set up three differ-
ent authorities. Doing so allows you to determine the exact amount of tax
collected for each locality tax on Peachtree’s Sales Tax report.
Before you set up the Sales Tax Authorities codes, you must set up a vendor
to whom you remit the sales tax. You can find out how to set up a vendor in
Chapter 5.
To follow this exercise, you must have a vendor set up; we will use Georgia
Department of Revenue as the vendor name in this example. To set up Sales
Tax Authorities, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Sales Taxes➪Sales Tax Authorities to display the
Maintain Sales Tax Authorities window.
2. Type an ID for the authority.
You can use up to eight letters or numbers (alphanumeric characters).
For our example, use GEORGIA.
3. Type a description of the authority.
You can type up to 30 characters. We typed Georgia State Sales Tax for
our example.
4. In the Tax Payable To box, type or select the vendor ID to which you
remit this sales tax.
This step assumes that you have set up the tax payee as a vendor, as
mentioned at the beginning of these steps. For our example, we chose
the Georgia Department of Revenue.
5. Enter the G/L liability account to which you want to post the sales tax
you collect.
115
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

6. Enter the tax rate, or select the Formula option and enter your sales
tax calculation method.
If your state charges 4 percent, type 4.00; if it charges 5.5 percent, type it
as 5.50. Peachtree automatically converts this value to a percentage.
7. Click Save.
8. Repeat Steps 2 through 7 for each authority you need.
Figure 7-1 shows the three authorities for our example.
Creating sales tax codes
After you determine the sales tax authorities, you need to set up the Sales
Tax Codes. The Sales Tax Codes are made up of combinations of Sales Tax
Authorities. Following along with the example we used in the preceding 
section, because your customers in Brown County have to pay a Georgia
State and Brown County tax, those two taxes together make up one Sales Tax
Code for your Brown County branch. The customers in Green County pay
Georgia State tax and Green County tax, so that combination generates the
need for a second Sales Tax Code. You also need a third Sales Tax Code for
those customers who simply pay the Georgia State tax with no county tax
included.
Follow these steps to set up a Sales Tax Code:
1. Choose Maintain➪Sales Taxes➪Sales Tax Codes to display the Maintain
Sales Tax Codes window.
2. In the Sales Tax Code box, type an ID. In the Description box, you may
type a description.
Figure 7-1:
Create a
separate
authority for
each sales
tax you
want to
track.
116
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Use a maximum of eight alphanumeric characters for the ID. We suggest
you use some type of description, perhaps using GABrown as an ID with
the description Georgia, Brown County.
3. Click the box in the ID column and enter the first taxing authority ID
for this tax code.
Peachtree fills in the description, tax rate, and G/L account you assigned
to the selected authority.
This ID text box reveals a little quirk in Peachtree. Generally, if a field
has a lookup list available, the field displays a magnifying glass for you
to click. This one doesn’t. We don’t know why . . . but it doesn’t. So, if
you don’t remember the taxing authority ID, you can right-click the ID
field to display the Sales Tax Authority lookup list. If you double-click
the ID field, the Maintain Sales Tax Authority window opens, allowing
you to create new sales tax authorities.
4. If your state requires you to charge sales tax on the freight you charge
to your customers, place a check mark in the Tax Freight box.
If you add a freight amount in the invoice freight box when you create an
invoice to your customer, Peachtree calculates tax on the freight.
5. Enter any remaining tax authorities for this sales tax ID and then click
Save.
See Figure 7-2 for an example.
6. Repeat Steps 2 through 5 for each Sales Tax Code you need.
7. Click Close.

Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

Working with Customers
Before you can generate quotes, sales orders, or invoices, you need to set up
your customer defaults and enter the individual customers. In Chapter 4, we
show you how to create the defaults you use here. Peachtree identifies each
customer by a unique ID that allows Peachtree to track any transactions
related to the customer.
Adding customers
When you set up a customer, you supply the customer’s name and address, a
sales account to use each time you post a sale to the customer, credit infor-
mation, and any custom field information you set up in your defaults. You also
can view historical data about your sales to and receipts from your customers
over the previous 12 months.
To add or modify customer information, choose Maintain➪Customers/
Prospects. Peachtree displays the Maintain Customers/Prospects window, as
shown in Figure 7-3. The following sections examine what you can do with
each tab in this dialog box.
The General tab
Peachtree supplies the General tab for basic customer identification informa-
tion, such as ID, name, address, and phone numbers. You use the ID as the
identification to select the customer when you create a customer transaction.
You can enter up to 20 alphanumeric characters (except the characters *, ?,
and +) for a customer’s ID. Peachtree sorts the customer reports by customer
ID. Numbers sort before letters, and because the field is case sensitive,
uppercase letters sort before lowercase letters.
Figure 7-3:
Use this
window to
add, edit, 
or delete
customers.
118
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

To make data entry easier, we suggest that you use either all uppercase or all
lowercase letters so that you don’t need to bother with the Shift key. Peachtree
sorts the Customer List report and many other reports using the Customer ID
by default. To get Peachtree to sort the customer list in alphabetical order by
default, use characters from the customer’s name as the ID.
Choose Maintain➪Customers/Prospects. Peachtree displays the Maintain
Customers/Prospects window. Fill in the General tab by following these steps:
1. Type a Customer ID and the customer’s Name.
You may enter up to 30 alphanumeric characters for the customer’s
name. IDs are case sensitive, so the IDs Baker, BAKER, and baker, for
example, are treated as three different customer IDs.
If you determine that you want a different ID, click the ChangeID button,
type the new ID in the Enter New Customer ID box, click OK, and then
click Save.
2. If you do not want this customer ID included on any customer reports,
click the Prospect check box.
A prospect is a potential customer, one who has not actually bought any
goods or services from you. If you generate an invoice for the prospect
or clear the check box, the prospect becomes a regular customer, and
Peachtree includes the ID on customer reports.
3. Fill in the contact information and phone numbers and, if appropriate,
the E-mail and Web Site addresses.
If you enter an e-mail address and click the icon next to it, Peachtree
opens your e-mail program and generates a message to your customer.
Clicking the button next to the Web address launches your Web browser
and directs it to the customer’s Web site. If you plan to e-mail forms
(quotes, sales orders, or invoices) to your customers, fill in the e-mail
address.
4. Click the drop-down arrow for the Bill to Address box, choose the ship-
ping address you want to enter, and enter the shipping information.
You can store up to nine shipping addresses for each customer.
Whenever you create a quote, sales order, or invoice, you can choose
from the stored shipping addresses, thereby saving data entry time.
We need to discuss two additional fields in this window: the Customer Type
field and the Sales Tax field.
 Customer Type: Use the Customer Type field to group similar customers
together. You can then limit the information on most A/R reports to a
specific customer type. For example, you may want to distinguish
100 235
500
99
83
119
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

between commercial customers and retail customers. Being consistent
when entering the customer type is the secret to using the Customer
Type field effectively. The Customer Type field is case sensitive.
 Sales Tax: You need to choose the Sales Tax Code that applies to this
customer. To do so, type the applicable Sales Tax Code or click the
lookup list button.
If you no longer do business with this customer, place a check mark in the
Inactive box.
The Sales Defaults tab
On the Sales Defaults tab, you can define several additional pieces of cus-
tomer information. Peachtree relates many of the fields on this window to the
inventory and payroll modules:
1. Choose Maintain➪Customers/Prospects and click the Sales Defaults tab.
2. If applicable, select a default Sales Rep for this customer and type the
Sales Rep ID or select one from the lookup list.
See Chapter 9 for information on creating sales reps.
3. Define a GL Sales Account for the customer if it’s different from the
default account established in Customer Defaults.
For more information about Customer Defaults, see Chapter 4.
When you create an inventory item, you specify a sales account for the
item. When you generate an invoice, the sales account associated with
inventory items overrides the customer sales account. You can find out
how to set up inventory items in Chapter 11.
4. In the Open P.O. # box, enter a purchase order number if your cus-
tomer has given you a standing purchase order number to use for all
purchases from you.
This purchase order number appears by default in the Customer Purchase
Order field on the Quotes, Sales Orders, and Sales/Invoicing windows.
5. In the Ship Via box, choose a preferred shipping method.
Determine shipping methods in the Maintain Inventory Item Defaults
window. If necessary, you can override the preferred method when you
generate a customer invoice. You set up shipping methods in Chapter 4.
6. If the customer does not have to pay sales tax, enter the Resale number.
Most states require a customer to provide you with their resale number
for tax-exempt purchases.
120
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

7. Choose the pricing level most often associated with this customer.
Pricing levels are tied to inventory items. See Chapter 11 for details on
how to assign up to ten prices to each inventory item. Peachtree then
automatically charges the customer the price shown in the pricing level
you specify here.
8. Select a form delivery method.
Forms include Sales Orders, Packing Slips, Invoices, and Statements.
To use the e-mail delivery method in Peachtree, you must have a MAPI-
compliant, default e-mail application installed on your computer. If your
default e-mail system is AOL, you will not be able to send e-mail from
Peachtree because AOL is not a fully MAPI-compliant e-mail application.
Terms and Credit tab
All things not being equal, Peachtree provides the ability to assign different
credit terms to different customers. You use the Terms and Credit tab to
establish the specific terms for the current customer.
Choose Maintain➪Customers/Prospects and click the Terms and Credit tab.
Peachtree assumes that each customer uses the default terms you established
when you set up Customer Defaults. To make any changes from the Terms and
Credit defaults, you must first remove the check mark from the Use Standard
Terms and Credit check box. You can then edit the terms, indicating whether
to charge finance charges, change the customer’s credit limit, or determine
whether or how Peachtree should notify you about the customer’s credit limit
status.
Use the Credit Status box to place a customer on credit hold. If a customer’s
status is Always Hold, Peachtree displays a warning message and will not
allow you to save an invoice for that customer.
Payment Defaults tab
The information stored on the Payment Defaults tab is optional. If you accept
credit cards from your clients, this tab provides a place to store the customer’s
credit card number and expiration date.
Options in the Receipt Settings area are time-savers. If the Use Receipts
window settings box is checked, Peachtree uses the payment method and cash
account you selected on the last saved receipt. You might want to change this
setting if, for example, the selected customer always pays by credit card but
the majority of your other customers pay by check.
121
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

Custom Fields tab
When you set up default customer information, (see Chapter 4), you created
the custom fields for the Maintain Customers/Prospects window. To enter
custom information, choose Maintain➪Customers/Prospects. Click the Custom
Fields tab and enter the available information for the customer in each custom
field box. Click the Save button to save this information.
History tab
When you first set up a customer, the History tab doesn’t have any informa-
tion. However, after you’ve recorded customer sales transactions, the History
tab gives you a month-by-month summary of both sales and receipts.
To view a customer’s history, choose Maintain➪Customers/Prospects and
then click the History tab. You can’t edit any information on the History
screen; Peachtree provides it for a quick overview of the customer’s history.
Customers move around, so you may find that the information you’ve stored
about a customer is outdated. You can change any information you entered in
the Maintain Customers/Prospects window. Display the customer’s ID,
change any desired information, and then click Save.
Where to begin? Beginning balances
Chances are, you’ve been selling your goods and services for a while. And . . .
you probably haven’t been paid yet for all the work you’ve done. You’ve prob-
ably given your customers a specified amount of time to pay their invoices to
you. You specify your terms when you set up your default customer informa-
tion in Chapter 4.
Although some invoices aren’t due yet, others may be past due. Either way,
the customer owes you money. When you begin using Peachtree, you need to
tell Peachtree about those unpaid invoices, especially if your business is
accrual based. Enter these as customer beginning balances.
Entering invoices as beginning balances does not affect the general ledger. In
an accrual-based business, sales are applied to your general ledger at the time
that you create the invoices.
To enter customer beginning balances, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Customers/Prospects.
2. Click the Beginning Balances button to display the Customer Beginning
Balances dialog box.
100 235
500

122
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

3. Double-click the first customer for which you need to enter a begin-
ning balance invoice.
Did you think you’d have to recreate your invoices? You don’t. Simply
provide Peachtree with a few key pieces of information.
4. Enter the invoice number and the date of the original invoice.
The date is needed so that Peachtree can age the invoice properly.
5. Optionally, enter the customer’s purchase order number for the
invoice.
6. Enter the invoice amount.
7. Enter A/R Account number.
The A/R Account is the Accounts Receivable account. Notice, we say
Accounts Receivable. We’re not talking about the sales account. It’s a
common mistake to enter the sales account number.
8. Repeat Steps 4 through 7 for each outstanding invoice for the selected
customer.
Figure 7-4 shows a sample list of outstanding invoices.
Technically, Peachtree has no limit to the number of beginning balance
invoices you can enter for an individual customer. However, if you
exceed 100 invoices, you can enter but not edit or delete the 101st
invoice and subsequent invoices.
9. Click Save.
Figure 7-4:
Enter

Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

10. Click the Customer Balances tab and select the next customer for whom
you want to enter beginning balances.
11. When you finish entering beginning balances, click the Close button.
Click it again to close the Maintain Customers/Prospects window.
We recommend that you print an Aged Receivables report to verify the
invoice information and dates and a Trial Balance report to make sure that
the Aged Receivables balance matches the GL balance.
Bidding with Quotes
Many businesses let their customers know how much a product or service
costs by producing a quote before the customer decides to buy. Peachtree
allows you to create a quote; when the customer determines he or she does
want to make the purchase, you can convert that quote to a sales order or 
an invoice.
Quotes are optional in the Peachtree sales process.
Entering quotes
The top part of the quote window contains header information such as cus-
tomer name, address, quote number, date, and other such information. Enter
the actual products or services you supply in the body of the quote. In Bonus
Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site, you can find out how to modify the appear-
ance of the Quotes window by using templates.
The steps to create, edit, and print quotes, sales orders, and invoices are
almost identical.
To create a quote in Peachtree, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Quotes/Sales Orders➪Quotes to display the Quotes
window, as shown in Figure 7-5.
2. Type or select the Customer ID.
You can’t enter a quote in Peachtree unless you have set up a customer.
Peachtree displays the customer’s current balance and credit limit in the
lower-left corner.
124
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

If you begin typing the Customer ID, only to find you haven’t yet entered
the customer into Peachtree, press the plus (+) key while the insertion
point is in the ID box. Peachtree displays the Maintain Customers/
Prospects window, allowing you to create the customer record. When
you close the Maintain Customers/Prospects window, Peachtree redis-
plays the Quote window. This procedure works for any lookup list you
open in Peachtree. Pressing the plus (+) key opens the appropriate
Maintain window: Vendors, Customers/Prospects, Inventory,
Employees/Sales Reps, or Chart of Accounts.
3. Type the recipient Ship To address, or click the Ship To arrow and
choose the Bill To address or one of the Ship To addresses you
entered when first setting up the customer.
Peachtree doesn’t store a manually entered ship to address permanently
in the customer record. However, Peachtree does store the custom
address with the current quote and transfers the address to the result-
ing sales order or invoice or both.
4. Enter the Date you want printed on the quote and an Expiration Date
for the quote.
Peachtree assumes that the quote is valid for a period of 30 days and
prints the ending date on the quote form. If you’re giving your customer
a longer or shorter period of time, choose a different date in the Good
Thru date box.
Figure 7-5:
Quotes
inform your
customer in
advance of
the price of
a product or

125
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

Peachtree doesn’t do anything to the quote if the customer doesn’t
respond in the specified number of days. The date is simply printed on
the quote form.
5. Optionally, enter a Quote Number.
If you’re going to print the quote (and usually you do), don’t enter a
quote number because Peachtree assigns the number when it prints the
quote. If you’ve already assigned the quote a number, perhaps from a
verbal quote, enter the quote number.
If you plan to have your vendor ship the item directly to your customer,
click the Drop Ship box.
It’s unlikely that your customer has given you a purchase order number
for a quote. After all, if you’re quoting it, it’s not yet a purchase. You can
leave the Customer PO field blank.
6. Optionally, type a shipping method or choose a shipping method from
the Ship Via list box.
7. Optionally, change the Terms for this order.
By default, Peachtree displays the terms you chose when you set up this
customer in Maintain Customers/Prospects.
8. Optionally, select a Sales Rep ID.
Take a look at Chapter 9 for information on how to set up a sales 
representative.
If your business is accrual-based, you can select the A/R Account option
for this potential sale, although typically you shouldn’t change the default.
If your company is cash-based, this field displays <Cash Basis> and you
can’t access the account box. If you have elected to hide general ledger
accounts in A/R, you won’t even see an A/R Account box.
9. In the body of the quote, enter the Quantity for the first item on the
quote.
If you’re quoting a service or product that doesn’t have a quantity, you
can leave the quantity blank.
10. If you’re selling an inventory item, select the Item ID.
Peachtree fills in the item description, the G/L sales account, the item’s
unit price, and the tax status. Then Peachtree multiplies the quantity
times the unit price for the amount. Read about setting up inventory
items in Chapter 11.
11. If you’re quoting or selling a nonstock item or you don’t use inven-
tory, leave the Item box blank and fill in the Description, GL (Income)
Account and Unit Price.
126
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Peachtree calculates the amount. If you did not enter a quantity in Step 9,
you must enter an amount instead of a unit price. If you enabled Peach-
tree’s spell-checking options, Peachtree flags any typing mistakes as they
happen.
Quotes do not affect the general ledger, but whenever the quote becomes
a sale, Peachtree uses the G/L account numbers to update your financial
information.
If you have globally hidden general ledger accounts, Peachtree does not
display G/L Account fields in the Quotes window. To modify G/L accounts
used for this transaction, you must click the Journal button in the window
toolbar.
12. If you’re quoting a noninventory item, select the Tax status.
The Tax box refers to the tax types you determine when setting inven-
tory defaults. Peachtree uses default tax types of 1 for Taxable and 2 for
Exempt. If you’re using inventory items, Peachtree determines the tax
type from the inventory item.
13. You probably won’t have a job number assigned yet because this is
still a quote, so skip the job box.
14. Repeat Steps 9 through 13 for each item you want to quote.
15. If you’re going to charge shipping charges, enter the estimated
amount in the Freight box.
16. Optionally, click the Note button to store one of three different notes.
Choose from a customer note, which prints on the actual Quote form,
a statement note, which prints on the customer statement, or an inter-
nal note, for internal reference only.
If you later convert the quote to a sales order or invoice, the notes con-
vert also.
We’re assuming that you need to print the quote; however, if don’t need to
print the quote, click the Save button. Peachtree saves the quote for future
reference. To print or e-mail your quote, click the Print or E-mail button. See
Printing Forms in Chapter 13.
Converting a quote to a sales 
order or an invoice
Congratulations! You got the sale! Now you’re ready to generate a sales order
or an invoice from the original quote.

To convert a quote to make the sale, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Quotes/Sales Orders➪Quotes to display the Quotes
window.
2. Click the Open button to display a list of previously created quotes.
3. Choose the quote you want to convert and then click OK.
You may have to click in the Show list to display quotes from a different
time period.
If you don’t remember what month you created the quote, try this: In the
Show list, choose All Transactions (it’s at the top of the list). Then click
Find and enter a few characters of your customer’s name. Click OK, and
Peachtree locates the first quote for the customer you specify. If this
isn’t the one you’re searching for, click Next. Peachtree locates the next
occurrence.
4. Change the date on the quote to the sales order or invoice date you
want to use.
The date you choose must fall within or be later than the current
accounting period.
5. Click the Convert button to display the Convert Quote dialog box.
6. Select a conversion option.
The options that appear depend on your selection are as follows:
• If you choose Sale/Invoice, you get a text box prompting you for 
an invoice number. If you elect not to enter an invoice number, 
the quote still converts to an invoice, but you need to print it at 
a later time.
• If you choose Sale/Invoice and Print Now, you’re prompted for 
a beginning invoice number and other print options after you 
click OK.
• If you choose Sales Order, a text box appears with the next sales
order number displayed. You can change this sales order number 
if desired.
7. Click OK.
After you convert a quote, it no longer exists as a quote if you click the Open
button in the Quote window. You can, however, see it as a sales order or
invoice in the Sales Order window or the Sales/Invoicing window.

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Working with Sales Orders
Why should you use sales orders? Why not just create an invoice? Well, this
choice is really a matter of timing. If your business receives a customer order
and ships the product or provides the service within a day or two, you could
skip the sales order step and wait to enter the invoice. If a lapse exists between
the time you take the order and the time you provide the product or service,
however, you may find the sales order feature helpful. The sales order feature
lets you enter items for a customer and then invoice and ship the items as
they become available, tracking the backorders in the system.
By viewing inventory and sales order reports, you know the number of items
backordered for your customers, which can help you plan purchases from
your vendors.
Even though you reference G/L accounts when you create a sales order,
Peachtree doesn’t update the general ledger until you create an invoice from a
sales order.
You may find entering data in the Sales Order window similar to creating a
quote. To create a sales order, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Quotes/Sales Orders➪Sales Orders to display the Sales
Orders window.
2. Fill in the Customer information or select the customer ID from the
lookup list.
The lower-left corner displays the customer’s current balance, credit
limit, and credit status. Click the arrow to display the customer ledger.
If the customer ID is not setup in Peachtree, the ID box flashes and when
you later save or print the transactions, Peachtree will prompt you to
save the customer information.
3. Type the Ship To address, or click the Ship To arrow and choose the
Bill To address or one of the Ship To addresses you entered when first
setting up the customer.
Peachtree doesn’t store a manually entered ship to address permanently
in the customer record. However, Peachtree does store the custom
address with the sales order and later transfers the address to the
resulting invoice.
4. Enter the date you want for the sales order and a ship by date.
The ship-by date can appear on several sales order reports to help you
better track your customer orders.

Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

Peachtree automatically assigns the next sales order number, but you
can change it if you want.
5. If you want your vendor to ship the item directly to your customer,
click the Drop Ship box.
If you activated the default inventory option in Peachtree Premium to
create purchases orders automatically, Peachtree creates a purchase
order for the item. See Chapter 4.
Refer to the previous section, “Entering quotes,” to review entering line
items
6. Fill in the body of the sales order, keeping the following variations in
mind:
• A sales order does not have a good through field.
• Your customer may or may not supply you with a customer pur-
chase order number.
• If you do not enter a quantity, enter an amount.
• If you’re using Peachtree’s job costing, you may have already
assigned a job number to the customer order. If so, be sure to indi-
cate the job ID and optionally the phase code and cost code to
each sales order line item.
Peachtree can play a visual trick on you here. When you click the Job box,
it expands backwards and covers up part of the Amount box (see Fig-
ure 7-6). At first glance, it may appear that the amount has disappeared,
but it’s only hidden. When you move the insertion point past the Job
box, Peachtree redisplays the Amount box. Read about setting up jobs in
Chapter 12.
• If you’re going to charge shipping charges and you know the
amount, enter it in the Freight Amount box.
• The Shipped quantity box is unavailable for you to edit. When you
ship the ordered goods, whether partially or completely, and bill
them on an invoice, Peachtree tracks the quantity shipped and
enters it in this column of the sales order.
7. Optionally, click the Note button to store one of three different notes:
a customer note, which prints on the actual Sales Order form, a state-
ment note, which prints on the customer statement, and an internal
note, for internal reference only.
8. When you’ve finished entering the sales order, click the Save button
to save the transaction or the Print button to print it.

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Generating an Invoice
Finally! Your company has produced the product or performed the service,
and you are now ready to collect your money. Most businesses generate an
invoice as proof of the sale to give or send to their customers.
If you read the previous sections on creating quotes or creating sales orders,
you know quite a bit about creating an invoice. As with quotes and sales
orders, you enter the invoice header and body information. The difference is
that when you do use sales orders, you enter the information a little differ-
ently from the way you enter data if you don’t use sales orders.
Invoicing against a sales order
Only one sales order can apply to an invoice. However, you can create multi-
ple invoices from a single sales order.

Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

To create an invoice and apply it to a sales order, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales/Invoicing to display the Sales/Invoicing window.
The Sales/Invoicing window is similar to the Quotes and Sales Order 
windows.
2. Type or select the Customer ID.
You can’t create an invoice in Peachtree unless you have set up a 
customer through Maintain Customers/Prospects.
Remember, with the insertion point in the ID field, you can press the
plus (+) key to display the Maintain Customers/Prospects window.
Here’s where things get a little different. See Figure 7-7. When you select
your customer ID, Peachtree looks for any open sales order for that cus-
tomer. If an open sales order exists, Peachtree automatically displays the
Apply to Sales Order No. tab.
If the invoice you want to enter does not apply to a sales order, click the
Apply to Sales tab and proceed to the information in the next section,
“Invoicing against sales.”

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

3. On the Apply to Sales Order No. tab, click the arrow to display a list
of open sales orders.
4. Choose the sales order you want to invoice.
Peachtree fills in the information you supplied when you created the
sales order, including Ship To, Purchase Order Number, Sales Rep, and
the items ordered.
5. Enter the invoice Date and change any header information.
Leave the invoice number blank if you want Peachtree to assign an invoice
number when you print the invoice.
Inventory item numbers on a sales order can’t be edited from an invoice.
To change item numbers, you must edit the original sales order. You can,
however, change the quantities or item description. To add additional
items or charges to the invoice, click the Apply to Sales tab and add the
items there.
6. In the Shipped column, enter the quantities shipped. Or if the entire
order has been filled, click the Ship toolbar button and choose All.
If you clicked the All button, Peachtree fills in the remaining quantities of
the order.
7. Enter the Freight amount.
If you entered freight information when you created the sales order,
Peachtree displays it on the invoice only if you use the Ship All feature. If
you make a partial shipment and need to charge freight, enter the freight
amount manually.
If you’re going to ship the product via UPS and plan to use the shipping
feature available in Peachtree Complete and Peachtree Premium, click
the Freight link. See “Shipping the UPS Way,” later in this chapter, for
information on the shipping feature.
8. Optionally, click the Note button to store one of three notes: a cus-
tomer note, which prints on the actual invoice, a statement note, which
prints on the customer statement, and an internal note, for internal ref-
erence only.
9. Click Save or Print.
You probably want to print the invoice, but if you are not going to print
it or if you want to continue entering invoices and print them later in a
batch, click the Save button to save the invoice. To print your invoices,
see “Printing Forms” in Chapter 13.
133
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

When you save or print the invoice, if the current invoice total plus any unpaid
invoices for this customer exceed the credit limit determined when you set up
the customer, depending on the credit status you selected, Peachtree will warn
you and potentially stop you from proceeding with the invoice.
Invoicing against sales
Your business doesn’t use sales orders? You can create an invoice without a
sales order.
To create an invoice, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales Invoicing to display the Sales/Invoicing window.
2. Enter the invoice header information.
To review how to enter the header information, see the “Creating quotes”
section, earlier in this chapter. The header information includes the
invoice date, shipping address, customer’s purchase order number 
(if available), shipping method, terms, and sales rep ID.
3. If you want your vendor to ship the item directly to your customer,
click the Drop Ship box.
If you activated the default inventory option in Peachtree Premium to
create purchase orders automatically, Peachtree creates a purchase
order for the item. See Chapter 4.
4. Fill in the line items for the invoice based on the following options:
• Enter a quantity for the first item on the invoice. You can leave 
the Quantity field blank when invoicing a service or product that
doesn’t have a quantity.
• If the product is an inventory item, select the item ID. Peachtree
fills in the item description, the G/L account, the item’s unit price,
and the tax status. Then Peachtree multiplies the quantity times
the unit price for the amount.
You can tell Peachtree to warn you if you do not have enough stock to
sell the item. See “Setting Inventory Defaults” in Chapter 4.
• If your product is a non-inventory item or you don’t use inventory,
leave the Item box blank and enter a description, G/L account, and
unit price.
• The Tax box refers to the tax types you determine when setting
inventory defaults. If you’re using inventory items, Peachtree
determines the tax type from the inventory item.
134
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

• If you do not enter a quantity, enter an amount.
• Optionally, if you’re using Peachtree’s job costing feature, click in
the Job box to display the magnifying glass and then choose a job
from the list.
• If you’re going to charge shipping charges and you know the
amount, enter it in the Freight Amount box.
If you are going to ship the product via UPS and plan to use the shipping
feature available in Peachtree Complete or Peachtree Premium, click the
Freight link which saves the invoice and opens the Shipping window
with the customer information already entered. See “Shipping the UPS
Way,” later in this chapter, for information on the shipping feature.
5. Optionally, click the Note button to store one of three different notes.
You can choose from a customer note, which prints on the actual
invoice, a statement note, which prints on the customer statement, and
an internal note, for internal reference only.
6. Click Save or Print.
You probably want to print the invoice but, if you are not going to print
it or if you want to continue entering invoices and print them later in a
batch, click the Save button to save the invoice. To print your invoices,
see “Printing Forms” in Chapter 13.
As with sales orders, if the current invoice total plus any unpaid invoices for
this customer exceed the credit limit you established when you set up the
customer, depending on the credit status you selected, Peachtree will warn
you and potentially stop you from proceeding with the invoice.
Shipping the UPS Way
This feature is available only in Peachtree Complete and Peachtree Premium.
What happens when you mix brown and peach? No . . . we’re not referring to
disintegrating fruit. You get UPS (brown) integration with your Peachtree
(peach) software! You might deliver your goods to your clients in many differ-
ent ways. You might hand deliver them, the customer might pick them up
from your warehouse, or you might ship them using a common carrier such
as a freight line or a parcel delivery service. If you ship your goods through
UPS, you can generate and track the shipment information directly through
Peachtree’s Shipments feature.
You must have an Internet connection for the Shipments feature to work.
135
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

A shipment generated through the Shipments feature doesn’t have to be for
goods you sell. It could be for any document or package you want to ship to
anyone, anywhere.
Before you can use the Shipments feature, you must have an account number
registered through UPS. Contact UPS at 1-800-PICK-UPS (1-800-742-5877) to ini-
tiate an account. Don’t lose the account number, because you’ll need it to reg-
ister through Peachtree’s Shipping Registration Wizard.
After you have an account number assigned but before you can ship your first
package, you must use the Shipping Registration Wizard to activate the link
between UPS and Peachtree. Choose Tasks➪Shipments➪Shipping Registration
Wizard. Follow the steps, which include entering your shipping address, a
contact person, your UPS account number, and the billing method you want
UPS to use.
The contact person entered in the Shipping Registration Wizard must be set
up as an employee in Maintain Employees even if you don’t use Peachtree to
process payroll.
Now when you have UPS packages to ship, follow these easy steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Shipments➪Shipments.
Peachtree opens a Shipping window like the one you see in Figure 7-8.
Ship to Type drop-down list
Estimate button
Figure 7-8:

136
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

2. Optionally, in the Ship to Type list, choose whether you’re shipping to
a customer, a vendor, or an employee.
3. Select the ID. If you’re not shipping to a customer, a vendor, or an
employee, leave this field blank.
If you clicked the Freight hyperlink in the Sales/Invoicing window, you
see the shipping window with the customer information and invoice
number already entered.
4. Enter a shipment number.
This is a required data entry field. After you create a shipment number,
such as 101, Peachtree remembers the sequence for the next shipment
and numbers it 102. Optionally, you could use the customer invoice
number as the shipment reference number.
5. Select the level of UPS service you want.
You can select the service level as well as any extras, such as delivery
confirmation or COD charges.
6. Optionally, in the Shipment Description box, enter a brief description
of the contents of the shipment.
7. Enter the package information, including package type and weight.
8. Optionally enter the package value and select whether you want the
package to have special handling.
Each package going to this recipient must be listed with its own package
type, weight, and dimensions. Peachtree lists the standard UPS provided
packages as well as a custom box, where you enter your own dimensions.
The length should be the longest dimension in the package.
9. If you want a cost estimate before shipping this order, click the
Estimate button and follow the on-screen instructions.
The UPS Estimate Settings box prompts you for the method you plan on
using to get the package to UPS and then displays a list of the UPS serv-
ice level options and their published rates.
10. Click the Process button.
Peachtree registers the shipment with UPS and assigns a UPS tracking
number.
If you are billing the total to the customer invoice and the customer
invoice already has an invoice number assigned, Peachtree thinks the
invoice is already printed and warns you that proceeding will change 
the invoice’s total amount due.
137
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

A confirmation message appears, stating the total estimated charges, and
prompts you to print the shipping labels. Print the shipping label on
plain paper and attach it to the package, usually in a special UPS window
envelope.
11. Click OK twice and then click Yes after the label prints.
Your UPS account does not get billed until the actual package is scanned
by a UPS representative. If you decide to not ship the package, you can
void the shipment by locating it through the Open button and clicking
the Void button.
You can track the status of your shipment by choosing Tasks➪Shipments➪
Track a Package and entering the UPS tracking number.
Editing a Sales Transaction
Like most transactions you enter in Peachtree, quotes, sales orders, and
invoices are not written in stone. Peachtree makes it easy for you to modify
anything on the transaction — even after it has been printed. Click the Tasks
menu and choose the type of document you want to edit: Quote, Sales Order,
or Sales/Invoicing. Next, click the Open button and choose the transaction
you want to edit and then click OK. Make any desired changes to the transac-
tion and then click Print to reprint the transaction or click Save to save the
transaction without reprinting it.
The Select Sales Orders, Select Quote and Select Invoice windows displays
sales orders generated in the current period. If you don’t see the transaction
you want to edit, open the Show list box and select a different period.
Voiding an Invoice
If you generate an invoice and then discover that the invoice needs to be can-
celed, use the Void Invoice feature. See Chapter 8 if you need to issue a credit
memo to the customer.
Although technically you could delete an invoice to get rid of it, deleting an
invoice is not good accounting practice. When you delete transactions, you
lose your audit trail of the actions you’ve taken. And, if the original invoice
occurred in a previous month, you could hurt the integrity of your reports.
Your accountant would not be a happy camper.
138
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

When you void an invoice, Peachtree creates several transactions. First, Peach-
tree creates another invoice with the same invoice number as the original,
except it adds a V to the invoice number. That invoice amount is a negative
dollar amount equal to the amount of the original invoice. For example, if you
generate invoice number 1234 for $150.00 that you must cancel, Peachtree gen-
erates another invoice 1234V for –$150.00 to void the original.
If the original transaction involves inventory items, Peachtree restores to
inventory the items sold. In the general ledger, Peachtree creates a reversing
entry, affecting sales and accounts receivable, and if applicable, cost of sales
and inventory. If the original invoice does not come from a sales order, the
reversing entry contains negative values for the quantities sold. However, if
the original invoice does come from a sales order, the reversing entry con-
tains negative values for the quantities shipped. Peachtree then reopens the
sales order.
Next, Peachtree creates a zero-dollar receipt to pay both the original and
voided invoices. This receipt clears both transactions from the Aged
Receivable report. In other words, if you add the two transactions together,
you get 0 and, a $0 transaction causes no change in your cash balance. You
can view the zero-dollar receipt by clicking the Open button in the Tasks➪
Receipts window and selecting the appropriate receipt.
To void an invoice, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales/Invoicing.
2. Click the Open button and double-click the transaction you want to
void.
The transaction must appear on the screen before you can void it.
Optionally, choose a different period from the Show drop-down list to
find the invoice you want.
3. Click the Delete button and then choose Void.
Peachtree opens a Void Existing Invoice dialog box like the one in 
Figure 7-9.
Figure 7-9:
Peachtree

the invoice
number,

139
Chapter 7: Selling Products and Services

4. Type the date you want — usually the current date — in The
Following Invoice Will Be Voided as Of box.
5. Click OK.
Peachtree lists the word Void beside both the original and reversing
invoices and uses the invoice number as the receipt reference number.
Recurring Invoices
In some businesses, you have customers that you bill the same amount every
month for the same products or services. By setting up recurring entries, you
can save a great deal of time entering these invoices. Even if the amount dif-
fers next time, it’s helpful to have all the other information filled out for you.
Then, you have to change only the amount.
Recurring entries can’t be created if you generate the invoice using a sales
order.
You also can create recurring purchases, payments, and general journal
entries. You can adapt the following steps for these other tasks.
To create recurring invoices, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales/Invoicing to display the Sales/Invoicing window.
2. Enter the invoice information as you usually would, but do not enter
an invoice number or click Save or Print.
3. Click the Recur button to display the Create Recurring Journal Entries
dialog box, shown in Figure 7-10.
4. Enter the number of times to create the entry, including the current
transaction.
The maximum number of times depends on the transaction’s original
date and the current accounting period. You can enter recurring transac-
tions only within the two open fiscal years of Peachtree. For example, if
you’re creating a new invoice and are currently in period 3, the maxi-
mum number of monthly recurrences would be 22.
5. Under When to Recur, select a time frame for the recurring invoice.
You can choose Weekly, Bi-Weekly, Monthly, Per Period, Quarterly, or
Yearly.
6. Optionally, assign a beginning invoice number by clicking the Assign
Invoice Numbers check box.
140
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Peachtree displays a box to enter a beginning invoice number. All transac-
tions are numbered incrementally. A number of our clients use a system
that includes the current year as the first two or four digits of the number,
followed by a dash and then the beginning invoice number.
Peachtree doesn’t automatically print recurring invoices. If you leave the
invoice number blank, you can print the recurring transactions when you
use Peachtree’s batch printing method or edit the transaction and click
Print. Chapter 13 discusses how to print batches of forms.
7. Click OK for Peachtree to save all transactions in the appropriate 
periods.
If you need to edit or delete a recurring transaction, Peachtree prompts you
with the Change Recurring Journal Entries dialog box. You can edit only the
current invoice or the current invoice and all future occurrences. Editing a
recurring transaction does not affect previous transactions.
Reviewing Customer Reports
Peachtree offers several useful reports that you can use for listing customer
information, compiling tax information, and tracking quotes that you want to
turn into sales. In Tables 7-2, 7-3, and 7-4, we provide you with a description
of the reports that pertain to selling your goods and services. You can sort

Chapter 8
Collecting the Money
In This Chapter
 Receiving your customer’s money
 Tracking accounts receivable
 Issuing credit memos
 Charging finance charges
 Printing statements
O
ne of our favorite sayings is, “As much fun as I’m having doing what I’m
doing . . . I’m still doing it for the money.”
Most people do find that their preferred part of being in business is collecting
the money. Peachtree not only provides you with an easy way to track the
money your customers owe you, but also provides you with a few ways to
encourage your customers to pay up.
Peachtree refers to the money you receive from your customers as receipts.
That sounds logical enough, doesn’t it?
Recording Receipts
Peachtree’s Receipts feature allows you to enter all checks, cash, and credit
card slips you receive and deposit them in your checking account. Peachtree
provides two ways to account for receipts. The method you use is mostly
determined by timing.
One method is used when you receive the customer’s money at the time of
the sale. You enter the receipt right on the invoice and when you print the
invoice, it can also show the funds received.
The other and most commonly used method is to apply the receipt to an
invoice through the Receipts window. You can use this method either if the
customer pays you at the time of the sale or at a later date.

Applying receipts to an invoice
To apply a receipt to a customer invoice, begin by taking a look at the
Receipts window:
1. Choose Tasks ➪Receipts to display the Receipts window.
2. If necessary, enter a deposit ticket ID.
What appears in the Deposit Ticket ID field of the Select for Deposit
window depends on your choice of methods for generating these IDs in
the Pay Methods tab in Customer Defaults. (See Chapter 4.) If you opted
for the Receipts window, Peachtree displays the current date; otherwise
this field is blank. If you leave the deposit ticket IDs blank, Peachtree can
automatically suggest deposit ticket IDs in the Select for Deposit window.
For more information about deposit ticket IDs, see, “Laughing All the Way
to the Bank,” later in this chapter.
If you want this transaction to be reconciled as a separate item, enter a
unique deposit ticket ID. You can find out more about account reconcili-
ation in Chapter 17.
3. Select the customer ID.
If this customer has unpaid invoices, Peachtree lists them on the Apply to
Invoices tab (see Figure 8-1). If the customer has no outstanding balance,
Peachtree displays the Apply to Revenues tab.

146
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Double-click any unpaid invoice to see the transaction details.
4. Enter a Reference number that helps identify the receipt.
You must enter a Reference number, usually the customer’s check
number. If the receipt was transmitted electronically, you might enter
the EFTS confirmation number or the date.
5. Enter the Date of the receipt.
Use this field to record the date you received the check, not the date on
the check.
6. Select a Payment Method: Cash, Check, Charge, and so on.
You set up payment methods in the Customer Defaults dialog box. You
can find out how to set customer defaults in Chapter 4. You can run
some reports based on payment methods. Chapter 15 shows you how 
to filter reports.
If the customer is paying by credit card, you can store the credit card
information or use Peachtree’s service to process the credit card. See
“Handling Credit Card Receipts,” later in this chapter.
7. In the Cash Account list, verify the bank account into which you’re
depositing the receipt.
Always confirm the cash account. Peachtree remembers which account
you last used in this window.
8. Place a check mark in the Pay column beside each invoice being paid
by this receipt.
If the amount of the receipt doesn’t match the invoice amount, enter the
actual amount received in the Amount Paid column.
If, based on the customer terms, the invoice is eligible for a discount,
Peachtree automatically displays the discount amount. You can accept
that amount, delete it, or enter a different amount. If you have discounts,
verify the discount account number at the bottom of the window.
If the amount paid is less than the amount due, Peachtree assumes 
that the customer still owes the difference. The next time you open the
Receipts window for the customer, Peachtree displays the remainder
due on the invoice.
If the amount paid is less than the amount due and you’re going to write
off the difference, enter the full amount of the invoice in the amount box
and then click the Apply to Revenues tab and enter a negative amount
for the amount you’re writing off. (Make sure the amount you’re writing
off is not taxed.) Choose your write-off account for the G/L account. This
process clears the invoice from A/R, posts the correct amount to cash,
and charges the unpaid balance on the invoice to the write-off account.
147
Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

If you do not see a box to select the G/L account, it means the boxes are
hidden. You can click the Journal button at the top of the window and
enter the account numbers you want to use.
If the amount paid is more than the invoice amount, Peachtree automati-
cally creates a credit balance against the specified invoice. The next
time you display the Receipts window for this customer, you see a credit
balance. If you’re going to absorb the overpayment (usually for small
amounts), click the invoice as paid in full and then click the Apply to
Revenues tab and enter the overpayment amount as a positive number.
This clears the transaction from accounts receivable.
If you make a direct sale that doesn’t require an invoice, click the Apply
to Revenues tab and specify a sales account and an amount.
The amount Peachtree displays in the Receipt Amount box should
match the total amount received from your customer.
9. Click Save to record the receipt or click Print to print a receipt that
you can give to your customer.
Printing the receipt also saves the receipt.
The Receipts window also gives you a handy way to write off an entire invoice
as a bad debt. In the Receipts window, enter a unique reference number that
helps identify the receipt as a write-off. For example, we typically use the let-
ters WO (for write-off) or BD (for bad debt) and the original invoice number
as the reference number (BD12345). Click the Cash Account box to select the
Bad Debt Expense account. Click the Pay check box for the invoice you want
to write off as a bad debt and then click Save. Peachtree clears the transaction
from account receivable and increases the bad debt expense account. Be sure
to change the cash account back to the regular checking account before clos-
ing the window.
Entering receipts from nonestablished 
customers
Occasionally, you receive money from a customer you haven’t invoiced. 
If the customer isn’t set up in your customer list, you can still record a
receipt.
The procedure is the same as applying receipts to an invoice, except you
won’t enter a Customer ID. Skip this field and enter the customer’s name in
the Name text box. Because you haven’t entered an invoice for this customer,
Peachtree displays the Apply to Revenues tab. Select the sales account, enter
the receipt amount, and then click Save or Print.
148
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Applying receipts at the time of sale
You can apply a receipt also by recording it at the time of sale as you create
the invoice. (You see how to create an invoice in Chapter 7.) Using this method
allows Peachtree to print the amount received on the invoice.
To apply a receipt at the time of the sale, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales/Invoicing window to display the invoice window.
2. Click the Amount Paid at Sale button to display the Receive Payment
dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-2.
3. Enter the payment information.
Also, be sure to verify the Cash Account into which you’re depositing
the money.
4. Click OK to close the Receive Payment window.
5. Save or Print the transaction.
Handling Credit Card Receipts
If your business accepts credit card payments from customers, you can enter
and track these transactions in Peachtree. Assuming (we know, there we go

window.

Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

assuming again) you have to wait for that time lapse before you receive the
money from the credit card financial institution, you can begin recording credit
card transactions in Peachtree, but you need the following first:
 A G/L account in your chart of accounts to use for the credit card receiv-
able amount. Create an account in the Accounts Receivable area of your
chart of accounts, giving it an ID and a description to identify it, such as
VISA Receivable. Choose Accounts Receivable as the account type. If nec-
essary, create additional accounts using the same method. (Chapter 3
shows you how to create accounts.)
 A vendor ID for the credit card financial institution that deposits money.
This way, you can record and track processing fee expenses.
To record a credit card transaction, you must follow two sets of steps: one
when the transaction occurs and another when you know that the credit card
financial institution has deposited the money in your account:
1. In the Receipts or Receive Payments window, record receipt informa-
tion but do not Save or Print the transaction yet.
You can apply the customer credit card receipts to open invoices or to
revenue.
Use the techniques shown in the “Applying receipts to an invoice,”
“Entering receipts from nonestablished customers,” or “Applying receipts
at the time of sale” section, earlier in this chapter. However, you must
use this exception: Enter the credit card receivable G/L account as the
Cash account.
2. To keep the customer’s ledger accurate and up-to-date, record the
amount paid as the full amount of the credit card charge, regardless
of how the financial institution handles processing fees.
You enter the processing fees as an expense when your bank statement
arrives.
3. Click the Process Credit Card button.
The Credit Card Information window appears, displaying fields that are
applicable to credit card transactions. (See Figure 8-3.)
4. Enter the credit card number and other information pertaining to the
customer’s credit card, such as name and expiration date.
You can store default credit card information in the customer record.
See Chapter 7 for more on storing customer information.
5. If you subscribe to Peachtree’s credit card service, click the Authorize
button to connect with your online merchant account provider.
When authorized, the provider will automatically supply the authorization
number. If you don’t subscribe to this service, enter the authorization
number manually.
150
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

6. Click OK and then click Save or Print.
After the credit card financial institution has notified you that the money has
been deposited into your account, you need to create another receipt that
transfers the funds from the credit card receivable account to your bank
account.
Create a receipt in the Receipts window just like you create any other
Peachtree receipt, with the following exceptions:
 Skip the Customer ID field and enter the credit card company name in
the Name field. Because you’re not using a Customer ID, Peachtree auto-
matically displays the Apply to Revenues tab.
 On the line item GL Account field, enter the credit card receivable GL
account number.
 Enter the amount actually transferred to your account.
Laughing All the Way to the Bank
When you enter receipts, you decide whether to assign a Deposit Ticket ID or
let Peachtree assign one when you go to the bank. Peachtree lets you group
deposited items together using the Select for Deposit window to greatly speed
up the bank reconciliation process.
What’s a Deposit Ticket ID, you ask? Well, Peachtree uses Deposit Ticket IDs
to make account reconciliation easier to manage. You should assign the same
Deposit Ticket ID to all transactions that you deposit on the same deposit
ticket. All receipts that use the same Deposit Ticket ID appear as one lump
sum in account reconciliation, making reconciliation a much easier process.
(See Chapter 16 for steps to use account reconciliation in Peachtree.)

Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

More often than not, you receive checks daily and enter them into Peachtree
daily, but you do not go to the bank until you’ve accumulated several days’
worth of checks. The following example lists five checks you receive on three
different days but want to lump together into a single bank deposit:
Date
Check Amount
March 16
$125.75
March 16
$28.41
March 17
$722.01
March 18
$549.10
March 18
$100.05
When you go to the bank, you make one deposit of $1,525.32, and that amount
appears on your bank statement. Although in Peachtree you have five differ-
ent receipts, assigning a single Deposit Ticket ID to these transactions makes
the total amount of $1,525.32 appear in the Account Reconciliation window. If
each of the five transactions above has its own unique Deposit Ticket ID, 
the Account Reconciliation window would list all five of them independently,
making bank account reconciliation extremely difficult. You’d have to sit and
figure out which transactions add up to the ones listed on your bank state-
ment. If you have lots of receipts with separate Deposit Ticket ID’s, you’d
spend lots of time trying to reconcile receipts to your bank statement.
The Select for Deposit window lets you combine multiple customer receipts
into a single bank deposit. To select receipts to include in a bank deposit,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Select for Deposit.
The Select for Deposit window appears, as shown in Figure 8-4.

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

To review, modify, or print an existing deposit, click the Open button.
Existing deposits include receipts that already have a Deposit Ticket ID
associated with them. If you entered the receipt with a Deposit Ticket ID,
that ID appears in the Deposit Ticket ID field.
2. If needed, select a different cash account from the Account ID drop-
down list.
If you don’t see a receipt that you plan to deposit, you may have entered
a Deposit Ticket ID on the receipt or you entered a different cash
account when you recorded the receipt. Edit the receipt to make the cor-
rection so that you can include it with the deposit.
3. Enter the Date on which you will make the deposit.
4. Enter or accept the currently suggested Deposit Ticket ID.
Peachtree maintains a numbering scheme based on the last Deposit
Ticket ID entered. Deposit Ticket IDs can be alphanumeric and up to eight
characters. We recommend using the deposit date and -1, -2, and so on.
For example, 031507-1 would be the first deposit made on March 15th.
5. Click the Deposit check box next to the receipts you want included in
the current deposit.
To quickly select all Deposit check boxes, click the All toolbar button
with the red check mark. To quickly clear all Deposit check boxes, click
the All toolbar button without the red check mark.
6. Click the Print button to print and save the deposit record or choose
Save to save the deposit without printing it.
Peachtree calls the form a deposit ticket, but it does not contain the bank
routing information needed to get the money into your account. You
might ask your bank whether you can simply attach the report to an
actual deposit slip to save you time and effort. It’s also helpful to print 
a copy for your records and attach your bank receipt to it.
Boing! Handling Bounced Checks
One of those nasty facts of life, now and then, is that customers write 
bad checks, sometimes by accident and sometimes not. In Peachtree, you
handle checks returned for nonsufficient funds (NSF) in two simple steps:
1. Create a new invoice to charge the customer the NSF fees.
2. Create a receipt and apply a negative amount for the same amount as
the original check.
For example, suppose the original (bounced) check is for $82.10. In 
the example you see in Figure 8-5, we created an NSF invoice number,
153
Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

23501NSF, for $20.00. Then, on the receipt window, we apply a negative
$82.10 (which represents the original returned check amount) against
the open invoice.
3. Click Save.
Peachtree updates the customer balance to reflect the money that the
customer once again owes against the original invoice and corrects your
bank account balance.
Later, when your customer writes you a second check or instructs you to rede-
posit the original check, you will have a second receipt for audit trail purposes.
If the customer writes a second check for the original amount plus the NSF
fee, Peachtree clears the invoice in full. If, however, the customer instructs
you to redeposit the original check, enter only the amount of the check. After
all, the customer still owes you the NSF fee.
We really hope you don’t have to use this section of our book.
Giving Credit Where Credit Is Due
Unfortunately, products are returned sometimes, or you need to make an
adjustment to a customer invoice. In these situations, you need to create a
credit memo to reduce the amount of money your customer owes.
Figure 8-5:

154
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

If you owe money to a customer for overpayment or because you applied a
credit memo to an invoice, you can write a check to the customer for the
refund amount you owe.
Creating a credit memo
You can create a credit memo that refers to an unpaid original invoice, or you
can create an open credit. Additionally, you can create credit memos for inven-
toried items or other goods or services. The following steps show you how to
use Peachtree’s Credit Memo feature:
1. Choose Tasks➪Credit Memos to display the Credit Memos window.
2. Enter the Customer ID.
After you select a customer, Peachtree fills in the customer name and
address. In the lower-left corner of the window, you can see the cus-
tomer’s current balance as of the system date. You can click the button
next to the balance to display a Customer Ledger report of the invoices
and receipts that make up the balance.
3. Select a Date and enter a Credit No.
For the Credit No., we suggest that you use the original invoice number
preceded or followed by CM to indicate credit memo. This numbering
scheme helps you tie the credit memo to a particular sale.
4. If the credit memo is for an unpaid customer invoice, click the drop-
down list on the Apply to Invoice No. tab and select the invoice
number for which you are recording a credit memo.
Peachtree fills in the lines that appear on the original invoice.
If you’re creating a credit memo for which there is no existing invoice,
click the Apply to Sales tab and enter the information for the items to be
credited, including quantity, item, price, and if applicable, job.
5. In the Returned box on each line of the Apply to Invoice tab, type the
quantity the customer returned.
Enter the returned quantity as a positive number. Peachtree understands
that this is a return. (See Figure 8-6.)
To quickly fill in the original transaction quantities, click the Return
button and select All.
If the customer is returning inventory items, Peachtree automatically
restores the item quantities to inventory. If the inventory items are 
damaged, you will need to enter an inventory adjustment to remove
them. See Chapter 11 to make inventory adjustments.
If the customer is returning serialized inventory items, click the Serial
Number button and select the serial numbers being returned.
155
Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

If you charge the customer a restocking fee, enter it on the Apply to
Sales button with a negative dollar amount.
6. Click the Save button to save the transaction, or click the Print button
to print and save the credit memo.
Peachtree applies the credit memo to the open invoice and closes both
transactions. If you created a credit memo without applying it to an
invoice, the credit memo appears on the Aged Receivable report.
Issuing refund checks for a credit memo
If you owe money to a customer for an overpayment, an open credit, or 
some other reason, you can write a check to the customer for the refund
amount owed.
Issuing a refund check is a two-part process. First, you write the check from
the Payments window, and then you apply the check to the credit memo or
overpayment in the Receipts window. This process is based on the assump-
tion that you’ve already created a credit memo or applied the overpayment.
See the preceding section for more information.
Follow these steps to issue a customer refund check:

1. Choose Tasks➪Payments to display the Payments window.
2. Select Customer ID from the first drop-down list, indicating that the
check goes to a customer rather than a vendor (see Figure 8-7).
3. Choose the Customer ID of the customer receiving the refund.
As with generating checks to vendors, don’t enter a check number if
Peachtree will be printing the check for you. Enter a check number only
if you’re writing checks by hand (heaven forbid).
4. Verify the check Date and the Cash Account from which you are writ-
ing the check.
5. On the Apply to Customer Account tab, enter a description for the
refund.
Entering a description helps you remember later, why you issued the
refund.
6. Enter or select the GL account to which you want to post the refund
amount.
Typically, this is your Accounts Receivable account.
7. Enter the amount of the refund.
8. Click Print or Save.

Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

When you create a check to a customer, Peachtree applies it to the customer
account, and it appears as a balance due from the customer. To complete 
the process, you need to apply the refund check to a credit memo or an 
overpayment.
1. Choose Tasks➪Receipts.
2. Select the Customer ID.
The credit memo appears in the invoice listing, along with the refund
check.
3. Click the Pay check box for both the credit memo and refund check.
The amount of the receipt displays zero (0.00). Therefore, no money is
being applied to the general ledger. See Figure 8-8.
4. Enter a receipt Reference number, such as the check number you
wrote to the customer.
5. Click Save.
Both transactions are cleared from accounts receivable.
Entering Finance Charges
Sometimes you want to nudge your customers into paying their bills on time
by charging them a late fee or a finance charge if they pay later than the due
date. Peachtree can calculate finance charges for all customers who have not
been excluded from finance charge calculations and who meet the filter crite-
ria you determine when it’s time to apply the finance charges. Chapter 4 shows
you how to set up your default finance charge terms.
Figure 8-8:

158
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

If you don’t want to charge finance charges to certain customers, you must
alter the default terms for those customers. In the Maintain Customers/
Prospects window, click the Terms and Credits tab. Then remove the check
mark from the Use Standard Terms and Charge Finance Charge boxes.
How do finance charges work?
To whom does Peachtree charge finance charges? Well, only customers who
have a check mark in the Charge Finance Charge box, mentioned in the pre-
ceding paragraph. Okay, that’s obvious, but what other criteria does Peachtree
use? After all, if a customer isn’t late paying, you don’t want to charge a finance
charge.
Peachtree calculates finance charges using the following formula for each
overdue invoice:
Finance Charge = Number of Days Past Due multiplied by the
Daily Rate multiplied by the Outstanding Invoice
Amount
The formula uses these definitions:
 Daily Rate is the percentage you set divided by 365 days.
 Outstanding Invoice Amount is the balance remaining unpaid on the
invoice.
 Number of Days Past Due is the number of days between the date that
you calculate finance charges and one of the following:
• The invoice date if aging is set to Invoice Date in the Customer
Defaults dialog box
• The due date if aging is set to Due Date in the Customer Defaults
dialog box
• The date of the last finance charge calculation
To clarify these definitions, consider an example: Suppose that today is July
15, and you want to calculate charges for an invoice dated 5/1 (due 5/31) in
the amount of $200.00. Your company charges an 18 percent finance charge
for invoices 30 days overdue. You age your customer invoices by due date.
First, the invoice is overdue by 44 days (from May 31st to July 15th):
(.18/365) x 44 x 200.00 = 4.34
The .18/365 is the annual percentage rate divided by 365 days. Multiply that
by the 44 days the invoice is past due, and then multiply that times the $200.00
invoice amount. Therefore, a finance charge applied on 7/15 would be $4.34.
159
Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

Applying finance charges
Okay, now that you understand how the finance charge process works, you
can actually apply the charges.
When you decide to apply a finance charge, Peachtree creates but does not
print an invoice for the amount due. The charges do appear on customer
statements, so you need to apply finance charges before you print customer
statements:
1. Choose Tasks➪Finance Charge to display the Calculate Finance Charges
dialog box.
2. Optionally, select a range of customers for whom you want to calculate
finance charges.
If you leave the customer range blank, Peachtree assumes you want to
calculate charges on all eligible customers (by way of the Charge Finance
Charges check box).
3. Enter the date you want Peachtree Accounting to use to calculate
finance charges and then click OK.
The Apply Finance Charges dialog box seen in Figure 8-9 appears.
4. If you’d like to review the finance charges before Peachtree applies
them, click No to Apply Finance Charges. Or if you’d prefer to just go
ahead and apply the charges, click Yes to the Apply Finance Charges
section dialog box.
5. Choose a Report Destination (Screen or Printer) and then click OK.
The Finance Charge Report Selection dialog box appears. You don’t have
to print the report, but we recommend that you do.
Figure 8-9:
You can
preview
finance
charges
before

160
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

6. Click OK to print the report in detail.
7. If you elected to review the charges before Peachtree applied them,
repeat Steps 1 through 6, but choose Yes in Step 4.
Peachtree applies the finance charges to the customer.
The finance charge entries are generated with a reference number that begins
with the letters FC (for finance charge). Therefore, never enter a customer
invoice with a reference number that begins with FC. Otherwise, Peachtree
uses that transaction when recalculating finance charges.
Producing Statements
Before you print statements the first time, you may want to determine state-
ment default preferences. Refer to Chapter 4 on how to set statement default
options.
To print statements, follow these steps:
1. Choose Reports➪Accounts Receivable.
2. Click the Customer Statements folder.
Peachtree considers statements a form. See Chapter 13 for information
on customizing forms.
3. Double-click the statement form you want to use.
4. Select any of the following options from the Statement dialog box:
• Statement Type: On balance forward statements, only the balances
left over from previous statements appear. On open items, the detail
for all open items appears.
• Print Detail for: Choose to print or not print the line item detail
information for invoices, credit memos, and receipts.
• Date: Select the date range of the transactions you want to print on
the statements.
The Filter Range options also allow you to select specific customer IDs
or types. You can also choose the Form Delivery option, which lets you
choose how you want to deliver forms to the defined range of customers:
as paper copies only, as e-mail attachments only, or as both paper copies
and e-mail attachments. If you choose either E-mail or Both, the E-mail
tab becomes available, letting you set up more form delivery options.
See Chapter 13 for details on printing and e-mailing forms.
5. Click OK.
161
Chapter 8: Collecting the Money

When the statements finish printing, Peachtree asks you whether the state-
ments printed correctly and if it’s OK to update the Customer file. If you click
Yes, Peachtree stores the statement date in the customer record to use it as
the balance forward date the next time you print statements. If you click No or
Cancel after printing statements, Peachtree does not update the Customer file
and maintains no record of having printed a statement. That means Peachtree
will continue to list invoices as open items on any statement you print. If you
are using Balance Forwarding statements, it is therefore important that you
answer Yes when statements print successfully.
Reporting on Money Your Customers Owe
Although Peachtree can’t guarantee that you make a profit every month, it
does give you some ways to show you (or your investors) your various finan-
cial reports. We’re sure you like to track the money you’re taking in so that you
can plan your budget or keep your banker happy. So, in Table 8-1, we provide
a description of the reports that pertain to collecting your money.
See Chapter 14 to find out how to print reports.

 Setting up employee defaults
 Writing and printing payroll checks
 Paying commissions or bonuses
T
hey call it work for a reason, some people say. And we can’t think of too
many people who are willing to work without being paid. If you aren’t
using an outside payroll service, you may want to consider using Peachtree’s
payroll features.
Peachtree’s payroll features mimic the functions you perform when you pre-
pare payroll checks by hand. But after you’ve set up basic background informa-
tion for each employee (yes, you still need to know the employee’s gross wages
and number of exemptions), we think that preparing payroll in Peachtree is
much easier and faster than preparing payroll checks manually. Why? Because
you don’t need to look up payroll taxes in the Circular E flyer, you don’t need to
remember which employees have various deductions, and you don’t need to
subtract the taxes and deductions to determine the net payroll check. Further-
more, you don’t need to keep track of the payroll tax liability amounts you, as
the employer, must pay. And, if you allow Peachtree to print the checks, you
don’t need to write them. In this chapter, we show you how to set up your
employees and produce paychecks.
Even if you prepare payroll in Peachtree, you’re going to have questions
about handling various situations. The Circular E booklet that you get from
the government every December is your bible for payroll questions. If you
don’t understand the Circular E, contact your accountant. If you don’t under-
stand your accountant, hire a new one.

If you use an outside payroll service, you may want to consider using
Peachtree’s payroll features to keep your general ledger up to date. That 
way, you can accurately report your company’s financial picture. If your 
outside payroll service provides you with journal entries, you can ignore
Peachtree’s payroll features and simply enter the journal entries (see 
Chapter 17). However, if your outside payroll service doesn’t provide you
with journal entries, you may want to use Peachtree’s payroll features to
mimic the payroll process and match your records with theirs.
Understanding Payroll Basics
Before you start setting up employees and paying them, you really need to
consider some basic information: whom you pay and when you should start
using payroll in Peachtree.
Peachtree uses payroll tax tables to calculate the amounts you deduct for taxes
(Federal Income Tax, Social Security, Medicare, and so on). Best Software, the
company that produces Peachtree, does not ship tax tables that calculate fed-
eral taxes with the software. To accurately calculate payroll, you must either
subscribe to Peachtree’s Payroll Tax Table Update service or create your own
tax tables. To order tax table updates, call 1-800-336-1420 Monday through
Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. eastern standard time.
Employees and sales representatives
In this chapter, we’re talking about paying people who work for you. You can
rule out vendors for this discussion. Vendors don’t work for you — they just
provide you with goods or services. You pay vendors from the Payments, Write
Checks, or Select for Payment window, as detailed in Chapter 6.
Both employees and sales representatives work for you. As you see in this
chapter, you pay employees from the Select for Payroll window or the Payroll
Entry window. Although employees are always employees, sales reps might
be employees or independent contractors. The windows in Peachtree that
you use to pay sales reps depend on their employment status: employee or
independent contractor.
If you are uncertain about an individual’s status, check with your accountant.
Employees work for you, so, in this chapter, we’re talking about them. And
sales representatives who are also employees work for you, so we’re talking
164
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

about them. We aren’t talking about sales representatives whom you treat as
independent contractors; you pay them as 1099 vendors from the Payments
window or the Select for Payments window. See Chapter 5 for information on
designating a vendor as a 1099 vendor. See Chapter 6 for information on paying
vendors.
Most sales representatives, whether they’re employees or independent con-
tractors, earn commissions. If you want to track commissions to make paying
sales reps easier, you need to specifically identify sales reps (both employees
and independent contractors) in Peachtree. Interestingly, Peachtree has you
set up a sales representative in the same window where you set up employ-
ees, even though the sales representative might be an independent contrac-
tor and not an employee.
So, being the logical individual that you are, you ask, “If a sales rep isn’t an
employee, why should I set up a sales rep in the same window where I set up
employees?” Peachtree has you set up sales reps in the Maintain Employees/
Sales Reps window for two related reasons:
 If you set up sales representatives in the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps
window, you can include the sales rep on invoices.
 If you include a sales rep on an invoice, you can produce the Sales Rep
report, which shows commissioned and noncommissioned sales amounts
per sales rep.
Including a sales rep on an invoice does not automatically generate a commis-
sion amount for the sales rep. The inventory items sold on the invoice must
be subject to commission. In the “Writing and Printing Payroll Checks” section,
we tell you how to pay sales representatives who are also employees. In the
“Determining commission amounts” section, you see a sample of the Sales Rep
report. See Chapter 7 for more information about including sales representa-
tives on invoices. See Chapter 11 for information on making an inventory item
subject to commission.
When should you start to use payroll?
You can start using payroll at any time during a calendar year, but you may
find it easiest to start using payroll on January 1. Why? Because, if you start
using payroll on January 1, you won’t have to enter any beginning balance
information — information to account for paychecks you’ve already produced
this year that need to be included on payroll tax forms and W-2s at the end of
the year.
165
Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

If you can’t start using payroll on January 1, try to start on the first day of any
payroll quarter: January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1. Payroll tax laws require
that you file payroll tax returns quarterly, and you need to include information
only for the current quarter. So, if you start using payroll at the beginning of a
quarter, you can enter beginning balance information as lump sums for each
quarter of the current year in which you’ve produced payroll checks.
As a final resort, if you can’t start using payroll on the first day of any payroll
quarter, start using payroll on the first day of a month. You need to enter begin-
ning balance information for the other months in the current payroll quarter,
but you can enter quarterly amounts for other payroll quarters of the current
year in which you’ve produced payroll checks.
Working with Employee Information
In Chapter 4, we show you how the Payroll Wizard walks you through setting
up default payroll information for your company. After the default informa-
tion is in place, you need to set up your employees, establishing individual-
ized information for each of them. For example, different employees claim
different withholding exemptions. And some employees may participate in a
company retirement plan, but others may not. Or some may receive a health
insurance benefit. To set up employees, choose Maintain➪Employees/Sales
Reps. Peachtree displays the General tab of the Maintain Employees/Sales
Reps window (see Figure 9-1).
Figure 9-1:

At the top of the window — not associated with any of the tabs in the 
window — you assign an ID and type in a name. You also can check the
Inactive box when an employee leaves the company to avoid accidentally
generating a paycheck.
If you need to change an employee’s ID, click the Change ID button.
Note that you can set up each person as an employee, a sales rep, or both.
Typically, you deduct payroll taxes for employees, and you don’t deduct pay-
roll taxes for sales representatives. If you select Sales Rep, three of the six tabs
in the window become gray, and the individual doesn’t appear in the Payroll
windows when you are paying employees. Choose Both if the individual is both
a sales representative and an employee.
We discuss each of the six tabs of the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps window
individually.
General employee information
You use the General tab (refer to Figure 9-1) of the Maintain Employees/Sales
Reps window to give Peachtree general information about each employee —
things like the employee’s name, address, and social security number (you
need those when you produce W-2s at the end of the year). You also can
supply the employee’s telephone number, date of hire, and e-mail address.
Peachtree provides the Type field to give you a way to group employees. If
your company pays worker’s compensation insurance, you might want to
store the worker’s compensation categories in the Type field to make it easier
to produce a report that helps you pay your worker’s compensation liability.
In the lower-right corner of the tab, you see the Beginning Balances button.
Click this button if you’re starting payroll on any day other than January 1 and
you’ve already produced paychecks in the current year. Peachtree displays
the Employee Beginning Balances window (see Figure 9-2).
Use the boxes in this window to enter payroll amounts you’ve already paid
this year before you started using Peachtree. Each column represents a pay
period that you specify: a week, a biweekly or semimonthly pay period, a
month, a quarter, or even multiple quarters. For example, suppose that you
want to start entering payroll as of July 1, which is the beginning of the third
payroll quarter. In the Beginning Balances window, you can enter one column
of numbers that represents the sum of all the payroll amounts you’ve paid for
the first six months (two quarters) of the year for each payroll field.
167
Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

Although you can enter amounts for each pay period, we don’t recommend
that approach, simply because it’s cumbersome and time-consuming.
At the top of each column you intend to use, right-click to display a calendar
and select the ending date of the timeframe represented by the amounts.
Then, in the boxes below the date, type the appropriate amounts for each
payroll field, entering deductions as negative amounts and earnings as posi-
tive amounts. Based on the information in Figure 9-2, we’re starting payroll 
on May 1. In the first column, we include the quarterly amount for the first
quarter of the year. In the second column, we include the monthly amount 
for April, the first month of the second quarter.
Click the Save button when you finish, and Peachtree redisplays the Maintain
Employees/Sales Reps window.
Custom fields
If you choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees, you can view the
screen where you establish the custom fields that appear in the Maintain
Employees/Sales Reps window. When you click the Custom Fields tab, you
can type the appropriate information for the employee in each custom field
box. Custom field information is optional.
Payroll information
On the Pay Info tab of the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps window (see 
Figure 9-3), you tell Peachtree the method and frequency you use to pay the
employee. We cover both of these in this section, starting with frequencies.
Figure 9-2:

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Setting payroll frequency
Peachtree allows you to pay your employees using any of five frequencies:
 Weekly
 Biweekly
 Semimonthly
 Monthly
 Annually
You don’t need to pay all your employees using the same frequency; that is,
you can pay some employees weekly, some biweekly, and some monthly. The
choice is yours. Most companies tend to pay all employees at the same time,
but Peachtree doesn’t make you operate that way.
Determining pay method
Pay methods tell Peachtree how to calculate wages — and you set up the pay
methods your company uses in Chapter 4. When you open the Pay Method list
box (click the drop-down arrow to the right of the box), you see that you can
choose Salary, Hourly – Hours per Pay Period, or Hourly – Time Ticket Hours:
 Choose Salary to pay your employees a flat rate, regardless of the
number of hours they work in a pay period.
 Choose Hourly – Hours per Pay Period to pay your employees based on
hours they work in a pay period.
 Choose Hourly – Time Ticket Hours to pay your employees for hours
they work in a pay period as recorded on Time Tickets they submit.
Figure 9-3:
Tell
Peachtree
how often to

169
Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

You use time tickets when you intend to bill your customers for the time your
employees or your vendors work on projects for them. You can, but don’t
have to, pay employees based on the time tickets they submit. To find out
more about this pay method, see Chapter 10.
When you choose Hourly – Hours per Pay Period, Peachtree displays the
standard number of hours associated with the frequency you select:
 Frequency: Standard hours
 Weekly: 40
 Biweekly: 80
 Semimonthly: 88
 Monthly: 176
 Annually: 2112
You can change the value that appears in the Hours per Pay Period box. For
example, you can set the number of hours to zero to ensure that you don’t
accidentally pay an employee for time not worked.
You indicate the amount, per pay period, that you want to pay the employee.
In Figure 9-3, we’re paying the employee time-and-a-half for overtime and
double-time for special occasions (maybe Sundays). For salaried employees,
you typically don’t see an Overtime field.
If you plan to use time tickets to bill your customers for the time an employee
works on projects — even if you don’t pay the employee based on time 
tickets — supply an amount in the Hourly Billing Rate box.
Peachtree Premium users can track an employee’s raise history. Click the Raise
History button, and Peachtree displays a dialog box where you can record the
following:
 The raise date
 The pay rate to which the raise applies (Regular, Overtime, or Special in
our sample company)
 The base amount associated with that pay rate, the Raise Amount, or
the Raise Percentage (you enter one and Peachtree calculates the other)
 Any notes you may want to make about the raise; for example, you might
want to note that the raise was based on the employee’s annual perfor-
mance review or was an out-of-cycle raise due to the on-going stellar
performance of the employee
The window also shows the calculated new amount for that pay rate, but
Peachtree doesn’t change the amount that appears on the Pay Info tab. You
must make that change manually.
170
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Withholding information
On the Withholding Info tab, you provide — you guessed it — tax withholding
information, such as the employee’s marital status and the number of exemp-
tions he or she claims for federal, state, and local withholding. You also can
supply additional federal, state, and local withholding amounts as appropriate
along with the 401k deduction amount if your company has a 401k plan. Don’t
forget to check the Retirement Plan box if your employee participates in a 401k
or other retirement plan. Check the Statutory Employee box if IRS guidelines
qualify the employee as an employee based on the law. Briefly, four categories
of independent contractors qualify by law as employees. If you don’t know or
aren’t sure whether you have independent contractors whom you must, by
law, treat as employees, ask your accountant.
Peachtree reserves Special1 and Special2 for you to use in payroll tax formu-
las where a value in the calculation is unique for each employee.
Employee fields
You really need to understand only one aspect of the EmployEE Fields tab of
the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps window (see Figure 9-4). You use that tab
to indicate anything about the employee that doesn’t follow the payroll defaults
you set up for the company back in Chapter 4.
For example, you may change the G/L account to send wages to a different
account than the default account. Or if an employee doesn’t participate in 
the company’s dental plan (such as Amanda in Figure 9-4), you’d remove the
check mark from the STD column (STD represents standard, as in the com-
pany default). If there had been a check in the Calc column, you would remove
it as well.
Figure 9-4:
Indicate any
nonstandard
information
about
employee
fields for the
selected
employee.
171
Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

You remove the check mark from the STD column so that Peachtree allows you
to remove the check mark from the Calc column. What’s the Calc column? Well,
when you place a check mark in the Calc column, Peachtree expects to use a
payroll tax table to calculate the amount for the field. You remove the check
mark from the Calc column under two conditions:
 When you’re not going to use a calculation to figure the amount for the
employee; instead, you want to supply a fixed amount in the Amount
column
 When you don’t want to calculate the field for the employee
If the employee’s calculation is different from the standard (default) calcula-
tion, and you remove the check mark from the STD column but don’t remove
the check mark from the Calc column, you can select a different calculation
for the employee. Simply click in the Tax Name column to use the lookup list.
If you don’t intend to calculate the field for the employee, you must remove
the check marks from both the STD column and the Calc column. Otherwise,
Peachtree still calculates an amount based on the formula in the payroll tax
table.
Employer fields
The EmployEE Fields tab and the EmployER Fields tab in the Maintain
Employees/Sales Reps window closely resemble the same tabs in the Employee
Defaults dialog box. That makes sense because Peachtree gets the information
it displays in the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps window from the informa-
tion you enter in the Employee Defaults dialog box.
The EmployER Fields tab, like the EmployEE tab, is used to indicate anything
about the employee that doesn’t follow the defaults you set up for the 
company.
Writing and Printing Payroll Checks
Now you come to the part that your employees like most — the part where you
produce paychecks. Peachtree enables you to pay employees en masse or one
at a time; we discuss both methods. Typically, you pay groups of employees
at the same time, so we think you can make more use of the group method.
We recommend that you let Peachtree print paychecks for you. You can save
lots of time and reduce the possibility of introducing errors because you won’t
be typing in information.
172
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

In this section, we show you how to produce and print paychecks and how to
pay commissions and bonuses — two other common payroll needs.
Paying a group of employees
Paying a group of employees is similar to paying a group of vendors. In this
section, we walk you through how to select employees to pay and how to
print paychecks.
If you write your checks by hand or use an outside payroll service, plan 
to print the paychecks that Peachtree produces on plain paper, because
Peachtree posts the information to the general ledger when you print the
checks.
Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Select for Payroll Entry.
Peachtree displays the Select Employees – Filter Selection dialog box you
see in Figure 9-5. Use this dialog box to select the majority of employees
you want to pay.
Try to make the selection include everyone you want to pay, even if the
selection includes more people than you intend to pay. After you make
choices in this dialog box, you have another opportunity to exclude
employees.
173
Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees
Using the Direct Deposit service
For an additional fee, Peachtree supports use of
a direct deposit solution in all versions of
Peachtree except Peachtree First Accounting.
Using direct deposit, you still create paychecks
in Peachtree the same way that we describe in
preceding sections in this chapter, identifying
employees who participate in direct deposit as
you create the paychecks. You don’t actually
print the paychecks to give to employees;
instead, through the Direct Deposit service,
money is electronically transferred from your
bank account to each employee’s bank account
on payday. If you want to print a stub for your
employees, you can do so as you create the
paychecks. Using the Direct Deposit solution,
employees can select one or more bank
accounts into which money can be deposited;
the employees can identify fixed amounts or
percentages to deposit to each account.
Directly deposited paychecks appear in Account
Reconciliation in lump sums that should match
your bank statements. Checks processed through
the Direct Deposit service become read-only in
Peachtree, and you cannot edit them.

2. In the Pay End Date box, select the date that represents the last day of
the pay period.
3. In the Include Pay Frequencies section, check all of the boxes that
represent the pay frequencies you want to include.
For example, include employees you pay weekly. As you can see from
the dialog box, you can include all pay frequencies. If you don’t have any
monthly or annual employees, you can leave the boxes checked without
affecting anything.
4. In the Include Pay Methods section, choose to pay hourly employees,
salaried employees, or both.
5. Use the Include Employees section to limit the range of employees 
you pay.
If you want to pay all employees who meet the other criteria you estab-
lish in this dialog box, simply choose All Employees. Otherwise, in the
From box, select the first employee you want to include. Then, in the To
box, select the last employee you want to include.
We suggest that you include all employees because you have another
opportunity in the next window to exclude an employee.
If you have enabled direct deposit, the Employees drop-down list contains
two additional choices besides All and Range; you see Direct Deposit Only
and Manual Check Only.
6. Click OK.
Peachtree displays the Select Employees to Pay window (see Figure 9-6).
7. If you don’t like the selection you see, click the Select toolbar button
to redisplay the Select Employees – Filter Selection dialog box (refer
to Figure 9-5).
Figure 9-5:
Identify the
employees
you want 
to pay.
174
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

The Select Employees to Pay dialog box has some options you should keep 
in mind:
 You can change the cash account from which the checks will be written
if necessary.
 An asterisk next to an employee’s name signifies that you’ve set up 
the employee’s pay method as Hourly – Time Ticket Hours, and that
employee’s paycheck is based on the number of time ticket hours in the
current pay period. Find out more about time tickets in Chapter 10.
 If you’ve enabled direct deposit, you see an extra column in the Select
Employee to Pay window to the right of the Pay column; the additional
column is titled DD. A red check mark in this column identifies employees
who are set up to use direct deposit. You can remove the check mark,
but you cannot add a check mark to anyone who is not set up to use
direct deposit.
 You can change the number of hours worked for hourly employees or
the salary amount for salaried employees; Peachtree recalculates the
taxes and net check amount.
 You can change the number of weeks in the pay period. Typically, you see
1, 2, 12, or 52; these numbers indicate the frequency with which you pay
each employee (weekly, biweekly or semimonthly, monthly, or annually).
Changing the number of weeks in the pay period affects the pay period
beginning date on the paycheck stub. Peachtree calculates the beginning
date by subtracting the number of weeks from the Pay Period Ending Date.
You can print the Pay Period Beginning Date on a paycheck stub. You need
to customize the payroll check form to add the field. See Chapter 13 for
information on customizing forms.
 You can avoid paying an employee by removing the check mark from the
Pay column.

Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

Viewing the details
You can view and make changes to the details of any employee’s check.
Highlight the employee and click Detail on the toolbar. Peachtree displays 
the Select Employees to Pay – Detail window. When you finish viewing or
changing details, click OK to redisplay the Select Employees to Pay window.
Don’t change Social Security or Medicare amounts. If you do, you’ll find dis-
crepancies on your payroll tax reports, and the 941 quarterly payroll tax return
won’t be accurate. You can, however, change the Federal Income Tax and state
income tax amounts with no side effects. Make changes to the hours/salary
first and the taxes second; if you make the changes in the opposite order,
Peachtree will recalculate the taxes and ignore your tax changes.
Allocating time to jobs
If you use jobs and want to allocate an employee’s time to various jobs, follow
the steps in the “Paying a group of employees” section to display the Select
Employees to Pay window. Then follow these steps:
1. In the Select Employees to Pay window, click the employee.
2. Click the Jobs button to display the Labor Distribution to Jobs
window (see Figure 9-7).
3. Click in the Job column on the line displaying the type of pay you want
to allocate — Regular, Overtime, or Special.
Peachtree inserts a blank line.
4. Click the blank box in the Job column to display a lookup list button.
5. Use the Lookup list indicator to select a job.
6. In the Hours or Amount column, assign hours or dollars to that job.
Peachtree assigns the hours or dollars to the selected job and adjusts the
unassigned hours or dollars accordingly.
Figure 9-7:

7. Repeat Steps 3 through 6 as needed to continue distributing hours or
dollars.
8. Click OK when you’re finished to redisplay the Select Employees to
Pay window.
Listing the checks that you plan to print
Wouldn’t it be nice to know how many checks Peachtree is planning to print?
(You may have noticed that you don’t see that number in the window any-
place.) Well, if you click drop-down arrow on the Print button and then click
Report, Peachtree prints a report that shows you the details of checks you’re
printing. At the end of the report, you also find the number of checks you’re
printing. To preview checks on-screen, click the drop-down arrow on the Print
button and then choose Preview. See Chapter 13 for details on printing forms
(checks are called forms in Peachtree).
Printing checks
If you click the Print button in the Select Employees to Pay window, Peachtree
displays the Print Forms: Payroll Checks window. From this window, you can
confirm (or change) the first check number, select a check form, identify the
number of copies to print of each check, and select a printer.
If you click the Practice button, you can print practice checks to see Xs and 9s
on the form where words and numbers will appear. Click Print, and Peachtree
prints the checks and displays a dialog box asking you to confirm that the
checks printed properly. Click Yes to post the checks; click No if you need 
to reprint the checks for any reason—like a printer jam.
Paying employees individually
Do you need to pay only one or two employees? Use the Payroll Entry window
and follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Payroll Entry to display the Payroll Entry window (see
Figure 9-8).
2. Use the Lookup list indicator next to the Employee ID field to select an
employee to pay.
Peachtree fills in the employee’s regular payroll information. On the left
side of the window, you see Pay Level information. On the right side of
the window, you see payroll fields, such as the employee’s taxes and
deductions, as well as other payroll liabilities you incur such as Federal
Unemployment Tax.
177
Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

3. If necessary, change the information.
Set the Pay Period Ends date and the Cash Account.
If an hourly employee doesn’t work all of the hours in the pay period,
adjust the number of hours on the left side of the window.
Don’t change Social Security or Medicare amounts. If you do, you’ll find
discrepancies on your payroll tax reports, and the 941 quarterly payroll
tax return won’t be accurate. You can, however, change the Federal
Income Tax and state income tax amounts with no side effects. Make
changes to the hours/salary first and the taxes second; if you make the
changes in the opposite order, Peachtree will recalculate the taxes and
ignore your tax changes.
4. To assign the employee’s hours to a job, click the Jobs button at the
top of the screen.
For details, see “Allocating time to jobs,” earlier in this chapter.
5. Click the Print button to print the check.
Peachtree displays the Print Forms: Payroll Checks window.
You can preview checks before printing them by clicking the drop-down
arrow on the Print button and choosing Preview.
Figure 9-8:
Use this
window to

178
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Don’t assign a check number before clicking the Print button. If you do,
Peachtree prints “Duplicate” on the check because Peachtree assigns
the check number to the check when you print it.
6. Confirm (or change) the first check number, select a check form, iden-
tify the number of copies to print of each check, and select a printer.
For details on selecting and printing a form, see Chapter 13. If you click
the Practice button, you can print practice checks to see Xs and 9s on the
form where words and numbers will appear.
7. Click Print.
Peachtree prints and posts the checks, updating the employee’s record
and the general ledger.
If you don’t print checks — say because you are entering after-the-fact
payroll information provided by a payroll service — you can simply save
the check. If you save the check instead of printing it, assign it a check
number.
Paying commissions, bonuses, 
or other additions
Many companies pay employees bonuses at the end of the year. And employ-
ees who act as sales representatives usually earn commissions. It may seem
strange to you that we’re talking about two different situations in the same
breath, but Peachtree handles both situations the same way. In fact, you can
use the technique we show you here to handle any form of additional lump-
sum income that you must pay through payroll, such as jury duty or mater-
nity leave. We refer to these lump-sum income amounts as payroll additions.
Setting up a payroll item
You can use a pay level to record a bonus or commission, but we recommend
that you use the technique we describe here for three reasons:
 You can control whether to include the payroll addition in gross pay
when calculating payroll taxes or other payroll fields, such as retirement
contributions. (Peachtree automatically includes pay levels in gross pay
when calculating payroll fields.)
 The payroll addition appears as a separate item on payroll reports,
making the payroll addition easier to track.
 Setting up a payroll addition item is less work than setting up a pay level.
179
Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

Follow these steps to set up a payroll addition item for commissions:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees to display the
Employee Defaults dialog box.
2. Click the EmployEE Fields tab and scroll down to find a blank line.
3. In the Field Name column, type the name of the payroll addition.
The name you use will appear on the paycheck stub.
4. Assign the line to a general ledger account — usually your wage
expense account.
Because commissions (and bonuses, jury duty pay, maternity leave pay, and
so on) vary from employee to employee, you don’t check the Calc column
and create a payroll tax table to calculate the amount. You also don’t need 
to supply an amount in the Amount column. You need to tell Peachtree only
whether to include additional pay when Peachtree calculates gross wages for
each tax. For example, you may want Peachtree to include commission pay in
gross wages when calculating FIT, Social Security, and Medicare. At the same
time, you may want Peachtree to exclude commission pay in gross wages when
calculating a pension plan deduction.
Suppose that you want Peachtree to include additional pay in gross wages
when calculating Federal Income Tax. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees.
2. On the EmployEE Fields tab of the Employee Defaults dialog box,
scroll up to find the Federal Income Tax entry (it’s probably called
Fed_Income).
3. In the Adjust column for Fed_Income, click the button to display the
Calculate Adjusted Gross dialog box (see Figure 9-9).
4. If necessary, scroll down in the EmployEE Field Names area on the left
side of the dialog box until you see Commission.
5. Place a check mark in the Use column to have Peachtree add commis-
sion pay to gross wages before calculating federal income tax.
If you’re not sure whether you want Peachtree to include a payroll addi-
tion when calculating adjusted gross wages, ask your accountant.
6. Click OK to redisplay the Employee Defaults dialog box.
You need to repeat these steps for each payroll field for which Peachtree’s
calculation of adjusted gross wages should include commission pay —
at a minimum, Social Security and Medicare.
If you adjust the gross wage calculation for Social Security and Medicare,
be sure that you click the Adjust button for these payroll fields on both
the EmployEE Fields tab and the EmployER Fields tab.
7. Click OK to close the Employee Defaults dialog box.
180
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

To actually pay an employee a commission, simply fill in the amount in the field
on the employee’s paycheck. Peachtree adjusts appropriate taxes, based on
settings you established in the various Calculate Adjusted Gross dialog boxes.
Don’t change the Social Security or Medicare amounts on paychecks. If you do,
you may find discrepancies on your payroll tax reports and the 941 quarterly
payroll tax return won’t be accurate. You can, however, change the Federal
Income Tax and state income tax amounts on paychecks with no side effects.
The W-2 form and payroll additions
If you want, you can show commissions in Box 14 on the W-2. The assignment
is optional; that is, Peachtree includes the commission wages in Boxes 1 (gross
wages), 3 (Social Security wages), and 5 (Medicare wages) automatically.
Showing the wages in Box 14 simply identifies the component of Gross Wages
(Box 1) that were commissions.
To include commissions in Box 14, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees to display the
General tab of the Employee Defaults dialog box.
2. Click the W-2s button to display the Assign Payroll Fields for W-2’s
dialog box (see Figure 9-10).
3. In the text box next to number 14, type the name of the payroll field.
4. From the list box, select the appropriate field to print in Box 14.
In the example, we used Commission.
5. Click OK twice to save the changes.

Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

Determining commission amounts
With respect to commissions, one burning question pops immediately to
mind: How do you know how much commission to pay an employee?
When you produce an invoice that contains items that are subject to commis-
sion and you assign a sales rep to the invoice, Peachtree’s Sales Rep report
shows you the commissioned sales for each sales rep. Choose Reports➪
Accounts Receivable. From the Report List on the right, select Sales Rep
Reports. You can print this report (see Figure 9-11) for any date range. See
Chapter 7 for more information on invoicing and Chapter 14 for more infor-
mation on printing reports.
In Figure 9-11, Derrick Gross made three sales that contained commissioned
inventory items and one sale that contained no commissioned inventory
items. As his employer, you’d multiply the commissioned amount by Derrick’s
commission rate and pay him the resulting number.
Customer returns usually affect commissions due. We have a few recommen-
dations concerning paying commissions:
 Print the Sales Rep report only once each month and pay commissions
only once each month for the preceding month — to make sure that
you’ve processed all invoices for the month.
W-2s button
Figure 9-10:
Use this
dialog box
to report
commissions
in Box 14 of
the W-2
form.
182
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

 Add the Amnt Recvd field to the report, as we did in Figure 9-11, and
summarize the report by customer so that you see the invoices that
have been paid and pay commissions only on paid invoices. See 
Chapter 14 for information on how to add a field to a report.
 Understand that the Total Sales column on the report does not include
sales tax, but the Amnt Recvd columns does include sales tax. When you
calculate the commission amount, be sure to calculate it on the Total
Sales column.
 Hold back a specified amount from each rep’s commission and pay that
amount when the sales rep decides to leave your company. This practice
protects you if you pay a commission for a sale that you later determine
you won’t collect. Be sure to include this policy in your employee infor-
mation packet, because you can be sure your employees are tracking the
commissions due to them.
 Reversing a commission for a merchandise return is not a problem. Simply
enter a credit memo and assign the sales rep to the credit memo. Reversing
a commission for a return where you don’t get any merchandise back 
is a little trickier. We suggest that you set up a nonstock inventory item
that you assign to your Sales Returns and Allowances account, making
sure to set the item up as subject to commission. When you issue the
credit memo, use the nonstock, subject-to-commission inventory item.
Figure 9-11:
Use the
Sales Rep
report to
help you
identify
commission
amounts 
to pay.
183
Chapter 9: Paid Employees Are Happy Employees

Dates for credit memos should be in the period when you enter the credit
memo — which is not necessarily the period in which you sell the item. That
way, you are always able to pay commissions for a specified period, and you
pay a net amount.
Writing the Payroll Tax Liability Check
You have to pay the payroll tax liability, and the IRS frowns greatly if you
don’t pay it in a timely fashion. The IRS classifies each employer as either a
semiweekly or monthly depositor, and your classification determines when
your payroll tax deposit is due after a payday. You make your federal tax
deposit at any bank, and you complete Form 8109 as your deposit ticket. On
Form 8109, you specify the amount of the deposit, the type of tax (such as
941), and the period for which the tax applies (first quarter, second quarter,
third quarter, or fourth quarter).
For simplicity’s sake, we strongly urge you to write your federal payroll tax
liability check and make your payroll tax deposit at the same time that you
generate paychecks. That way, you can’t get into trouble regardless of whether
you are a semiweekly or monthly depositor.
You write your payroll tax liability check from the Payments window. The only
tricky part is determining how much you owe.
Use the Payroll Tax Liability report to easily determine the amount of your
payroll tax liability. Choose Reports➪Payroll, and from the Report List on the
right, choose Tax Liability Report. If you print the default version of the report,
you see each tax name listed and each employee under that tax name, along
with the amount withheld and the liability amount for one month. We like the
summary version of this report for determining the amount of the tax liability
check. For monthly depositors, the summary version is easier to read than
the 941 Worksheet. Semiweekly depositors don’t need to mess with the 941 B
form anymore; simply use the Tax Liability Report for the specified timeframe.
Although Peachtree prints all taxes on the report by default, you also can print
the Tax Liability report for only one kind of tax: federal, state, or local. If you’re
viewing the report on-screen, click the Options button, and Peachtree displays
the Options dialog box for the report. Use the Tax list box to choose to print
either only federal, state, or local taxes. If you leave the Tax list box set to
print all taxes and place a check mark in the Print Report in Summary Format
box, you can produce a report that looks like the one shown in Figure 9-12.
184
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Use the totals in the Tax Liability column for each tax to determine the amount
of money you owe for each of your payroll tax liabilities. Then open the
Payments window and write a check to your local bank. Set the G/L Account
on the Apply to Expenses tab at the bottom of the window to your payroll tax
liability account(s) and the Cash Account to the account from which you’re
writing the check — you might use a payroll checking account (if you have a
separate account) or an operating checking account.
Paying your payroll tax liability doesn’t affect the numbers that appear on the
Tax Liability report. The report shows what you should pay and doesn’t con-
sider what you may have already paid, which is another good reason to pay
your tax liability at the same time you generate paychecks.
Exploring Payroll Reports
Besides the Payroll Tax Liability report we describe in “Writing the Payroll
Tax Liability Check,” Peachtree offers several reports that you can use for a
variety of tracking needs. Table 9-1 shows you a description of the reports
that pertain to payroll. See Chapter 14 to learn how to print reports.

Chapter 10
Billing for Your Time
In This Chapter
 Setting up time and expense items
 Entering Time and Expense Tickets
 Paying employees for hours worked
 Using tickets to create customer invoices
You’ve probably heard the saying, “Time is money.” Some companies, 
particularly those employing service-oriented professionals such as
accountants, consultants, lawyers, and architects, bill their customers for 
the time spent to complete projects. These companies often have employees
track time and expenses, such as travel, for each of their projects. Then the
employer bills the customer for the employee time and expenses. In some
cases, the companies also pay employees based on time worked.
In this chapter, you find out how Peachtree Premium and Peachtree Complete
support these billing functions — complete with a clock that lets you time
your activities.
See Chapter 12 to find out how you can use jobs in Peachtree to create reim-
bursable expenses — expenses you incur that may have nothing to do with
time spent by anyone but that you want to include on an invoice. Using time
and expense tickets provides an alternative — and possibly better — method
for creating reimbursable expenses if you don’t need jobs for any other reason.
(Chapter 12 lists information concerning the restrictions imposed if you use
Peachtree jobs.) If you find that your time and billing needs are more exten-
sive than the features provided by Peachtree, you might consider Timeslips,
which links with Peachtree.
Time and billing functions are not available in Peachtree First Accounting or
Peachtree Accounting.

Creating Time and Expense Items
If you plan to use the time and expense features in Peachtree, you need at
least two (but probably more) inventory items (yeah, we know that it’s weird
to use inventory items for time and expense features, but it’s true). You use
inventory items with an item class of Activity item to enter time-related activ-
ities, and you use inventory items with an item class of Charge item to enter
expense activities.
To create inventory items to use on time activities, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Inventory Items to display the Maintain Inventory
Items window (see Figure 10-1).
2. In the Item ID text box, type an label that identifies the item.
3. In the Item Class list box, choose Activity item for a time activity or
Charge item for an expense activity.
4. In the text box below the Item ID box, supply a description.
This description appears on reports but not on invoices to your 
customers.
5. In the Description text box on the General tab, fill in the description
that you want to appear on customer invoices for time spent on this
activity.
Figure 10-1:
Set up at
least one
Activity item
and one

to record
both time
and
expenses.
188
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

The description in the longer description box appears on the customer’s
bill unless you choose to display the description from the time ticket.
For details on the time ticket’s description block, see the “Entering Time
Tickets” section.
6. Enter up to ten billing rates for the activity by clicking the button
beside the Billing Rate box.
You may assign more than one billing rate to an employee or a vendor so
that you can bill the same employee or vendor at different rates for, say,
different customers or different situations.
7. Use the lookup list button to select a GL Income Account for the 
activity.
8. Use the lookup list button to select an Item Tax Type for the activity.
UPC/SKU, Stocking U/M, Item Type, and Location are all optional fields.
9. Click Save.
Entering Time Tickets
Peachtree’s Time Tickets feature eliminates the need for timecards and 
old-fashioned push-in, punch-out tracking of employee hours. You can use
Peachtree’s Time Tickets to
 Record time spent by employees or vendors to bill to a customer or job
 Track the cost of employee time spent on jobs
 Provide employees with a method to track time so that you can pay
them based on time worked
Chapter 9 provides information about one of Peachtree’s pay methods,
Hourly – Time Ticket Hours, which you can use to pay your employees based
on the hours entered on time tickets. If you pay an employee based on time
worked, you also need a way to account for employee time that you don’t
intend to charge to a customer or job — such as overhead time spent doing
marketing or bookkeeping. Although you won’t be billing the time to a cus-
tomer, you need to include overhead hours on the employee’s paycheck.
Peachtree allows you to enter overhead Time Tickets and marks any over-
head time you record as unbillable. And, as you might expect, you aren’t able
to include that time on a bill.
189
Chapter 10: Billing for Your Time

If you don’t pay your employees based on time tickets, you don’t need to
assign time to overhead activities.
Follow these steps to enter a time ticket:
1. Choose Tasks➪Time/Expense➪Time Tickets to display the Time
Tickets window (see Figure 10-2).
2. In the upper-left list box, select either Employee or Vendor and then
select an employee or vendor.
3. In the Ticket Date box, enter the date you performed the work.
4. In the Activity Item list, use the lookup list button to make your 
selection.
5. In the list box below the Activity Item box, choose Customer, Job, or
Administrative. If you choose Customer or Job, select the appropriate
customer or job using the lookup list button.
If you choose Customer or Job, you can include the time ticket on a 
bill; if you choose Administrative, Peachtree considers the time ticket
unbillable.
6. In the Ticket Description for Invoicing box, you can enter up to 
160 characters of text to use instead of the activity name on the cus-
tomer’s invoice.
7. In the Internal Memo box, you can provide up to 2000 characters of
descriptive information.
Figure 10-2:
Use this
window to
enter time
tickets.
190
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

You can’t include the Internal Memo description on a customer’s invoice,
but Peachtree prints it on reports. Use it to provide details about the work
performed.
To start a new paragraph while typing in the Internal Memo box, press
Ctrl+J.
8. If you are entering a Time Ticket for an employee, choose a Pay Level.
Don’t mess with the Has Been Used In Payroll check box; instead, let
Peachtree fill it in. If the box is checked, you’ve paid the employee for
the Time Ticket; unchecked means that you haven’t included the Time
Ticket on a paycheck yet.
9. Choose Manual Time Entry or Timed Duration and then do the 
following:
• For Manual Entry, supply a start and stop time as well as a break
time, if appropriate.
• For Timed Duration, click Start, and Peachtree runs a timer (the
Start button then becomes the Stop button).
Regardless of your choice, Peachtree calculates the duration of the time
ticket.
You can’t save a time ticket or close the Time Ticket window while the
timer is running.
10. Choose a Billing Type, as follows:
• Employee Rate: Uses the Hourly billing rate you entered on the Pay
Info tab when you set up the employee in the Maintain Employees/
Sales Reps window
• Activity Rate: Uses the rate you entered when you set up the activ-
ity in the Maintain Inventory Items window
• Override Rate: Ignores both the employee and activity rates and
allows you to enter any rate you want
• Flat Fee: Ignores the duration (and value) of the time ticket and
allows you to establish an amount for the ticket
All billing types are available for employees, but only some are available
for vendors.
11. Choose a Billing Rate.
The available rates depend on the choice you make for Billing Type in
Step 10. For example, you can establish only one employee rate, so if
you choose Employee as the Billing Type, you can’t change the billing
rate. However, you can establish up to five rates for an activity, so you
can choose a billing rate if you select Activity as the Billing Type. For
Override Rate, you must type a Billing Rate.
191
Chapter 10: Billing for Your Time

12. Choose a Billing Status: Billable, Non-Billable, Hold, or No Charge.
Billable and Non-Billable are self-explanatory. If you select Hold, you
can’t bill the ticket to a customer until you change the ticket’s status. If
you select No Charge, Peachtree changes the ticket’s value to $0, so you
can show your customer on the invoice that you performed work but
didn’t charge for it.
13. If you choose Flat Fee as the Billing Type, enter a Billing Amount.
For all other Billing Types, Peachtree calculates the Billing Amount.
14. Click Save.
Whew! This process seems like a lot of steps to enter a ticket, but it goes
quickly. The daily Time Ticket window appears in Figure 10-2, but Peachtree
also provides a weekly view. You can enter time tickets in the weekly view,
and you can print the weekly timesheet by clicking the Print button in the
window.
The columns in the weekly view aren’t terribly wide, and most contain lookup
list box selectors. As you enter information for a particular column, the list
boxes extend to cover up columns to the right of the current column. The
visual effect may make you think that columns have disappeared — but they
haven’t.
Entering Expense Tickets
Okay, good news here. Almost everything you just read in the preceding sec-
tion about time tickets applies also to expense tickets. For example, you can
enter expense tickets for both employees and vendors. And you can assign
an expense ticket to a customer or job so that you can recover the expense.
Or you can assign an expense ticket to overhead, making it unbillable. If you
assign an expense ticket to an employee, you also can place a check mark in
the Reimbursable to Employee box; Peachtree prints reimbursable expense
tickets in the Reimbursable Employee Expense report, making it easy for you
to pay employees for their expenses.
Choose Tasks➪Time/Expense➪Expense Tickets to display the Expense Tickets
window. In the Ticket Description for Invoicing box, you can type up to 160
characters, which can print on the customer’s invoice. In the Internal Memo
box, you can type up to 2000 characters.
Unit Price is tied to the Charge Item you select — you may see up to ten 
available unit prices. And you have the same four Billing Status options for
expense tickets that you have for time tickets: Billable, Non-Billable, No
Charge, and Hold.
192
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Paying Employees
Suppose that you pay employees from time tickets. You can use either of the
payroll windows we describe in Chapter 9. Figure 10-3 shows the Payroll Entry
window (choose Tasks➪Payroll Entry). When you set the Pay Period End date,
Peachtree automatically calculates the paycheck using time tickets from that
pay period that are assigned to Customer or Administrative (in that unnamed
list box we mentioned in Step 5 in the “Entering Time Tickets” section). If your
employee assigned the time tickets to Job instead of Customer or Administra-
tive, you need to click the Jobs button when you’re paying the employee to
see and select those time tickets.
193
Chapter 10: Billing for Your Time
Repaying employees for reimbursable expenses
Peachtree doesn’t try to repay your employees
automatically for expense tickets. You must
print the Reimbursable Employee Expense
report (shown in the following figure) for the
specified pay period to identify expenses for
reimbursement.
Then you can repay the employee in one of two
ways:
 Use the Payments window (choose Tasks➪
Payments) to write a separate expense reim-
bursement check to the employee. If you
want to track the reimbursable expense
checks to the employee, set the employee
up as a vendor.
 Include the reimbursement in the employee’s
paycheck by setting up a payroll field as an
addition. See Chapter 9 for details on setting
up additions. You need to assign the reim-
bursement to a general ledger account but
probably not to your wage expense account.
And, because reimbursements aren’t usu-
ally subject to payroll taxes, you need to
click the Adjust button for each payroll tax
and make sure that you’re not including 
the reimbursement item. When you pay the
employee, type a positive amount for the
reimbursement to add it to the paycheck.

Using Tickets to Bill Customers
If your employees or vendors assign time or expense tickets to customers or
jobs, you can bill the customers for those costs. Follow these steps to bill
customers using tickets:
To be sure you don’t forget to bill your customers for time or expense tickets,
print the Aged Tickets report before you create invoices.
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales/Invoicing to display the Sales/Invoicing window.
2. Complete most of your invoice as usual.
Select a customer using the lookup list indicator next to the Customer ID
box and assign shipping information, terms, and line item information if
this invoice includes more than reimbursable Time and Expense Tickets.
For details on entering invoices, see Chapter 7.
3. In the lower-left corner of the window, click the Apply Tickets/Expenses
button to display the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses window
(see Figure 10-4).
You can view available time tickets on the Time Tickets tab and expense
tickets on the Expense Tickets tab. To find out more about the Reim-
bursable Expenses tab, see Chapter 12.
4. To include a ticket on the invoice, click the Use check box next to the
ticket on the appropriate tab.

5. In the Invoice Amount column, verify or change the figure.
To build some profit into a ticket or a reimbursable expense, you change
the amount in the Invoice Amount column. To mark up costs or reduce a
group of tickets or reimbursable expenses, click the WriteUp button to
display the Select Tickets to Write Up/Down dialog box. You can adjust
tickets up or down by a dollar amount or a percentage. To mark up,
supply a positive number; to mark down, supply a negative number.
If you change your mind and decide that you don’t want to mark tickets up
or down, click the Remove WriteUp button (the one with the “not” symbol
in its image) in the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses window.
6. At the top of the tab, select a description for the ticket that will appear
on the invoice.
The first option, Use Ticket Description for Invoicing, tells Peachtree to
use the description supplied on the time ticket. The second option, Use
Item Description for Invoicing, tells Peachtree to use the description
supplied when you set up the item in inventory.
If you leave the Consolidate By list box setting at No Consolidation,
Peachtree creates separate lines on the invoice for each ticket you
choose to bill. You can use other entries in the list to consolidate each
type of ticket you use and reduce the number of lines on the invoice.
7. Click OK.
The reimbursable expenses appear on the customer’s invoice.
8. Supply G/L accounts, select a job if appropriate, print, and post the
invoice as usual.
See Chapter 7 for details on completing an invoice.

195
Chapter 10: Billing for Your Time

When you print tickets as separate lines on the invoice, Peachtree prints the
description you supplied on the expense when you created it. You see either
ticket descriptions or item descriptions on the customer’s invoice depending
on the selection you make in the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses
window. When you consolidate expenses on the invoice, Peachtree does not
supply a description. Instead, Peachtree prints the name of the G/L account
you choose as the description on the invoice and the total of all the tickets. If
you want, you can type a description on the line for the consolidated tickets
in the Sales/Invoicing window, and Peachtree uses that description instead of
the G/L account name.
Keep the following notes in mind when you work with tickets:
 You can delete tickets from the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses
window if you decide not to invoice the client for them. Place a check
mark in the No Bill box to the right of the expense. Deleting the ticket
does not delete the transaction that created the ticket; instead, deleting
in the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses window disconnects the
ticket and the customer.
You can’t undo a deletion you make in the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable
Expenses window. As soon as you delete a ticket, the connection between
the ticket and the customer is permanently broken unless you erase the
ticket and reenter it completely.
 Be aware that using a ticket makes it disappear from the Apply Tickets/
Reimbursable Expenses window. If you subsequently delete the line from
the invoice, the reimbursable expense does not reappear in the window.
If you mistakenly use the ticket and post the invoice, delete the invoice
and reenter it to make the ticket available again.
 You can edit a ticket you intend to bill to a customer. You can find the
transaction by opening the Time Tickets window or the Expense Tickets
window and clicking the Edit button.
Tracking Ticket Traffic
(Say that section title three times fast!)
The Reimbursable Employee Expense report is one example of the reports
Peachtree offers to help you keep track of time tickets. Table 10-1, provides
you with a description of the various other reports that pertain to time and
expenses. See Chapter 14 for more details on printing reports.

Counting Your Stuff
In This Chapter
 Creating inventory items
 Entering beginning balances
 Creating and building assemblies
 Adjusting prices
 Understanding Peachtree and inventory
 Generating inventory reports
T
his chapter is about stuff. Many businesses sell stuff you can touch, while
others sell stuff you can’t touch. Some stuff is made up of pieces of other
stuff. Peachtree lets you sell all these kinds of stuff. Enough stuff.
Of course, we’re talking about inventory. And not just the goods you place on
your shelves but other kinds of nonphysical items such as services, labor,
activities, and items you charge to your customer’s bill.
We’ll just warn you up front. The material in this chapter is rather dry, and you
probably won’t consider it too funny. However, inventory management is typi-
cally a crucial part of keeping your books. Peachtree makes handling inventory
a lot easier than trying to track it all by hand.
Creating Inventory Items
When you create inventory items, you set up the goods and services you sell.
You set a price (actually, you can set up to ten prices) at which you want to sell
your product and the account you want Peachtree to adjust when you sell this
item or service. But before you can set up selling prices, you need to supply
basic information about the item.

To create your virtual inventory, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Inventory Items.
Peachtree displays the Maintain Inventory Items window, with multiple
tabs for each item. The header information consists of the item ID,
description, and class.
2. In the Item ID field, type an item ID.
Keep in mind that the Item ID appears in lookup lists for sales transac-
tions and so on. Peachtree allows item IDs with up to 20 alphanumeric
characters.
IDs are case sensitive and can’t contain the asterisk (*), question mark
(?), or plus symbol (+).
3. Enter a description containing up to 30 characters.
This description appears in the item lookup lists. In the following section,
you’ll see how to type descriptions that you can use for sales or purchase
transactions. For example, in the lookup description, you might refer to a
specific birdbath as “Con PBB w/birds,” but when you sell this item, you’ll
want to be a little more descriptive, such as “Concrete bird bath with 2
bluebirds on pedestal base.”
If you discontinue an inventory item, you can mark it inactive; redisplay
the item in the Maintain Inventory window and check the Inactive box.
4. Choose an Item Class to identify the type of inventory item.
Selecting the right classes for your inventory items helps ensure that
Peachtree meets your business needs. Peachtree Premium supports 11
item classes, Peachtree Complete supports 9 item classes, and the other
versions support 7 item classes. Chapter 4 provides more information
on the different Peachtree inventory classes, but these are the basics:
• Stock: Inventory items you want to track for quantities, average
costs, vendors, low stock points, and so on.
• Non-stock: Items such as service contracts that you sell but do not
put into your inventory.
• Master Stock: Items that consist of information shared by a
number of substock items.
• Serialized Stock: Items that have serial numbers that you plan to
track. Serialized stock items appear only in Peachtree Premium
edition.
• Assembly: Items that consist of components that must be built or
dismantled.
200
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

• Serialized Assembly: Items that consist of serialized components
that you plan to build or unbuild. Serialized Assembly items
appear only in Peachtree Premium edition.
• Service: Services provided by your employees that you bill to your
customers.
• Labor: Charges you bill to a customer for subcontracted labor on
that customer’s projects.
• Activity: Records of how time is spent when performing services.
Activity items appear only in Peachtree Premium and Peachtree
Complete editions. Chapter 10 gives you more information on set-
ting up Activity and Charge items.
• Charge: On-the-job expenses of an employee or vendor. Charge
items appear only in Peachtree Premium and Peachtree Complete
editions. Chapter 10 gives you more information on setting up
Activity and Charge items.
• Description Only: Timesaver when you track nothing but the
description.
If you save an item as a stock item, an assembly item, an activity item, or
a charge item, you can’t change its item class. Although you probably
wouldn’t want to, Peachtree does allow you to interchange the item
class between nonstock, description, labor, and service items.
5. Check the Subject to Commission box if you want to track the sales of
the item and have it reported on the Accounts Receivable Sales Rep
report.
General options
You enter basic item information such as descriptions, account numbers,
sales prices, and pricing methods on the General tab.
Why does Peachtree list different description lines? Well, the first descrip-
tion, the one you entered in the header information (Figure 11-1), appears
when you open the inventory item lookup list.
Peachtree also provides the For Sales description and the For Purchases
description. The description (up to 160 characters) you enter for sales
appears on quotes, sales orders, sales invoicing, and receipts. The for pur-
chases description appears on purchase orders, purchases/receive inven-
tory, and payments. You can modify either the for sales or the for purchases
description when you create a transaction.
201
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

Follow these steps to enter general inventory information:
1. Click the arrow under description to select the description you want
to enter.
2. Enter a description as you want it to appear on transactions.
Entering information in the For Sales and For Purchases boxes is optional.
If you do not specify a sales description, Peachtree uses the lookup
description when you enter a quote, a sales order, an invoice, or a receipt.
If you don’t specify a purchase description, Peachtree uses the for sales
description when generating purchase orders, purchases, or payments. If
a sales description doesn’t exist, Peachtree uses the lookup description.
3. Type the price you want to charge.
Peachtree refers to the amounts that appear on your quotes, sales orders,
and invoices as sales prices. The sales pricing levels correspond with
those you assign your customers in the Maintain Customers/Prospects
window (see Chapter 7).
If you charge only one price for this item, no matter which customer,
enter only Price Level 1. To enter additional sales prices, click the arrow.
The Multiple Pricing Levels dialog box as shown in Figure 11-2 appears.
Be consistent when entering item sales price levels (for example, from
lowest to highest or highest to lowest).

Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Items prices can be a static number you assign, or you can create a calcu-
lation using the current price or the last cost as the foundation of the for-
mula. By default, Peachtree uses the pricing calculation you entered when
creating inventory defaults. (See Chapter 4.) You can, however, click the
Edit button to display the Calculate Price Level box and create a different
calculation. You can increase or decrease the price by a percentage or an
amount. When you’re finished, click OK twice to close both the Calculate
Price Level dialog box and the Multiple Price Levels window.
4. In the Last Unit Cost box, enter the last price you paid for this item
(optional).
After you enter transactions against the inventory item, the Last Unit
Cost box becomes unavailable. Peachtree automatically updates the
Last Unit Cost as you enter purchases, payments, adjustments, or begin-
ning balances, calculating the amount based on the costing method you
select in Step 8.
5. If necessary, select a different Cost Method.
The Cost Method is a very important field. You can’t change a costing
method after an inventory item is saved.
Costing methods apply only to serialized items and serialized assem-
blies, stock items, master stock items, and assemblies. In addition to
tracking serialized items and serialized assemblies by their specific unit
cost, Peachtree supports three other costing methods: average cost,
LIFO (last in, first out), and FIFO (first in, first out). The sidebar “How 
do costing methods work?” gives you more information on what these
methods mean. Typically, you set all inventory items to use the same

costing method, so you probably determined a default method when
you set up default inventory items information in Chapter 4. If you’re 
not sure, check with your accountant for advice about different costing
methods.
6. If necessary, change the GL accounts for the item.
You can review setting up the default GL accounts in Chapter 4.
7. Choose an item Tax Type.
The tax type you select applies when you enter the inventory item on
quotes, sales orders, invoices, or receipts. If you assign an exempt tax
type to an item, the item will never be taxed. If you assign a taxable tax
type to an item, you can still exempt the item from tax at the customer
or invoice level.
8. Enter an optional UPC or SKU number for your barcoded items.
9. Enter an item type (optional).
You’ll appreciate this when you’re generating reports. Grouping items is
much easier when they’re marked, for example, “supplies” or “raw mate-
rials.” Item types are case sensitive.
10. Enter a storage location for the unit (optional).
Someday you may need to know where the unit is located, such as Bin
17 or Shelf B3 or in Mom’s garage. The storage location is helpful also
when doing a physical inventory.
11. Enter a unit of measure (optional).
You may sell your products on an individual basis (each), in pairs, per
dozen, per pound or kilogram, or per ounce.
Peachtree Premium for Distribution and Peachtree Premium for
Manufacturing are the only editions that include the ability to purchase
and sell your products in different units of measure.
12. In the Minimum Stock box, enter the quantity at which you want
Peachtree to remind you it’s time to reorder the item (optional).
When the quantity on hand reaches the minimum stock quantity,
Peachtree prints the item on the Inventory Reorder Worksheet.
Although entering a minimum stock point is optional, you need to enter
a minimum stock point if you want Peachtree Premium to automatically
create a purchase order when the stock gets low.
13. Enter a reorder quantity (optional).
Reorder quantity is the quantity you generally purchase when you order
the inventory item. Entering a reorder quantity point is also optional, but
again you need to enter a reorder quantity if you want Peachtree Premium
to automatically create a purchase order when the stock gets low.
204
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

14. Tell Peachtree where you prefer to buy this item by selecting the
vendor ID in the Preferred Vendor field lookup box (optional).
Selecting a Preferred Vendor doesn’t mean that’s the only vendor from
which you can purchase the item. It just means that this vendor is your
favorite vendor. You must supply a Preferred Vendor if you want
Peachtree Premium to automatically create purchase orders for reorder
or for drop ship transactions and non-drop ship transactions.
15. Select the employee who is the usual buyer for this item.
The information can appear on the Buyer Report and can be used to
select items for automatic purchase orders.
16. If you’re not creating an assembly item, a master stock item, or a seri-
alized item and are ready to move on, click Save to save the inventory
item.
Later in this chapter, we show you how setup serialized items.
Additionally, we see how to set up a bill of materials for an assembly
item and master stock items with their substock items.
If you entered the item ID incorrectly, click the Change ID button and enter a
new inventory item ID
Whew! That’s a lot of stuff to enter for one item! Fortunately, the rest of the
Maintain Inventory Items window is easy and doesn’t involve too many tough
decisions.
Custom fields
If you’re using other Peachtree modules, such as A/R, A/P, P/R, or Job Cost,
you’ve seen custom fields before. Use custom fields to store miscellaneous
pieces of information about the inventory item that just don’t seem to fit any-
where else in the Maintain Inventory Items window. Examples of such items
are a substitute item number, the product average shelf life, or information
about an alternate vendor for the product. One of our clients uses a custom
field to store the chemical makeup of each item.
History
The History tab displays a summary of inventory transactions for stock,
assembly, and serialized items for past periods. Peachtree shows units sold
and received as well as sales and costs by accounting period. Peachtree does
not retain history for nonstock, service, and the remaining class items.
205
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

Serial numbers
The Serial Number tab is one location where you can view the in-stock serial
numbers of the current item as well as determine whether you provide a war-
ranty with the item. The Serial Number tab becomes available only if you class
the inventory item as a Serialized Stock item or a Serialized Assembly item.
Peachtree Premium is the only edition that support serialized inventory items.
Peachtree assigns to each serial number a status that you can’t change
except by entering transactions such as buying or selling. Table 11-1 shows
the different statuses and what they mean.
206
Part II: The Daily Drudge 
How do costing methods work?
If you’re not sure which option to choose in the
Cost Method box, you may want to know how
Peachtree handles these options. Peachtree
supports three main costing methods: Average,
FIFO (first-in, first-out), and LIFO (last-in, first-
out). (Those terms kinda remind us of Jack and
the Beanstalk — Fee Fie Foe Fum. . . .) Peachtree
also supports Specific Unit as a costing method,
but that method, available only in Peachtree
Premium, applies only to those items with a seri-
alized inventory class.
If you use the Average costing method,
Peachtree adds the total amount paid for the
items and divides that by the total units on hand.
The average is recalculated each time you 
purchase more of the item. Remember that
Peachtree calculates costs on a daily basis. As
an example, say you have on hand five widgets
for which you paid $6 each and three more wid-
gets for which you paid $7 each. That’s a total of
$51 for the eight widgets or an average of $6.375
each.
If you use the FIFO costing method, Peachtree
calculates costs at the earliest purchase price,
inventory increase adjustment, build, sales
return, or assembly unbuild (for the component
item) for a particular item. FIFO produces the
lowest possible net income in periods of falling
costs and the cost of the most recently pur-
chased item most closely approximates the
replacement of the item.
If you use the LIFO costing method, Peachtree
calculates costs at the most recent (last) pur-
chase price, inventory increase adjustment,
build, sales return, or assembly unbuild (for the
component item) for a particular item. LIFO pro-
duces the lowest possible net income in periods
of rising costs and the cost of the most recently
purchased item most closely approximates the
replacement of the item.

Table 11-1
Serialized Inventory Item Status Codes
Status
What It Is
Available
Serial numbers with this status are available for selection
on transactions. 
Sold
Serial numbers with this status are no longer available
because the serial number for the item has been removed
from inventory by a transaction such as a sale. 
Adjusted
Serial numbers with this status have been taken out of
inventory using an inventory adjustment. 
Returned
Serial numbers with this status have been returned to the
vendor using a credit memo. 
In Progress
Serial numbers with this status have been added to work
tickets that have not yet been closed. This status is avail-
able only in the Peachtree Premium for Manufacturing
and Peachtree Premium for Distribution editions.
New
Serial numbers with this status have been added to the
system by a transaction but the transaction hasn’t been
saved.
Error
Serial numbers with this status have been imported into
Peachtree with an on-hand quantity. However the trans-
action that added the serial number to the system (the
originating transaction) is missing.
Peachtree Premium for Distribution and Peachtree Premium for Manufacturing
editions also include Work Tickets to help track the build progress of an assem-
bled item. Work Tickets contain information about what’s needed to build 
an assembly and whether all the items are available. Work Tickets follow a
build through its process, and you can check off the build steps as they’re 
completed.
Serial number statuses are displayed on the Serial Numbers tab in the Maintain
Inventory Items window, on the Serial Number Entry window, and on the Serial
Number Selection window. Serial number statuses are reported on the Serial
Number History report.
Also on the Serial Numbers tab, you can indicate whether the current item has
a warranty and determine the length of the warranty period (see Figure 11-3).
Peachtree allows up to 90 days, months, or years for a warranty period.
207
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

You can customize your invoice to display the warranty information and war-
ranty expiration date. See Chapter 13 for information on customizing forms
such as invoices.
Whoa Nellie! Working with 
Master Stock Items
If you have lots of items and each of those items comes in a different flavor
such as color, size, or condition, you can end up with an out-of-control inven-
tory list. To help you harness your inventory list, Peachtree calls another of its
inventory classes Master Stock. You use Master Stock items when you might
have several variations of similar items, such as T-shirts in various colors and
sizes, or both new and used lawn mowers (as demonstrated in Figure 11-4).

208
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Master Stock items are available only in Peachtree Premium and Peachtree
Complete editions.
When you create a Master Stock item and designate its various attributes,
Peachtree creates Substock items for each category you determine. In our
example, instead of creating new and used versions of each lawn mower, we
can set up one Master Stock item, assign it to either the new or used version
of the Sales and Cost of Sales accounts, and then use the Item Attributes tab
to create new and used versions of the item. The Item Attributes tab becomes
available only if you are working with a Master Stock item. Use the following
steps to create a Master Stock item:
1. In the Name box under Primary Attributes, type a name that describes
the distinction you’re making for the item.
In the example, we typed New/Used.
2. In the ID box, type an ID that will identify the Substock item.
Peachtree will append this ID to the ID of the Master Stock Item.
3. In the Description box, type a description for the Substock item.
We typed N and New for the first Substock item and U and Used for the
second Substock item.
4. Click the Add button.
The ID and Description will appear in the box immediately below the ID
and Description boxes, and the full item ID will appear in the bottom of
the box in the Created Substock Items list.
5. Repeat Steps 2–4 for each Substock item.
Peachtree creates separate entries for each substock item; you’ll see
these entries if you click the lookup list indicator next to the Item ID
field. This method makes creating items with similar characteristics
quick and easy.
6. Click the Save button to save both the Master Stock Items and each of
the substock items you created.
You can’t sell Master Stock items; instead you sell one of the Substock items.
Because you don’t sell Master Stock items, Peachtree doesn’t track the Last
Unit Cost, the UPC/SKU, or any quantity information shown on the General
tab of the Maintain Inventory Items window.
During reporting, you can summarize report information for Substock items
by filtering most inventory reports to show only Master Stock Items. For
example, if you print the Inventory Profitability Report and filter it for Master
Stock items, you see the Master Stock item and numbers that are the totals
for all associated Substock items. On reports, you can’t filter for particular
substock items.
209
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

In the Beginning (Balance, That Is) . . .
Chances are, you’ve been in business for some time and have a current stock
of inventory goods. If so and you are setting up your Peachtree company for
the first time, you need to enter beginning balances for the items you have on
hand.
To enter inventory item beginning balances, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Inventory Items.
The Maintain Inventory Items window appears.
2. From the General tab, click the Beginning Balances button (in the
lower-right corner of the window).
The Inventory Beginning Balances dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 11-5.
3. In the list box, click the inventory item.
The item appears at the top.
4. Enter a Quantity and the Unit Cost, which is the price you paid for the
unit.
If you bought the items at a lot (bulk) price and don’t know the cost of
each one, skip the unit cost and enter the total cost you paid for the
goods. Peachtree divides the total cost by the quantity and displays the
result in the Unit Cost box.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for each inventory item in which you have stock.
6. Click OK to update the inventory balance.

Puttin’ Them Together, Takin’ Them Apart
Some stuff is made up of pieces of other stuff. Peachtree calls the pieces com-
ponents and the complete items assemblies. Maybe your company sells bird
feeders as a standalone product or as part of a package deal that includes a
post, a hook, and birdseed. The package deal is an assembly. Or, maybe you
sell a “doobob.” (Elaine, that one’s for you!) This doobob is made up of sev-
eral thingamajigs and a couple of whatchamacallits. You don’t actually sell
thingamajigs or whatchamacallits (components) to your customers, but you
still need to keep track of their quantities so you know how many doobobs
(assemblies) you can make. In either situation, you create the assembled
items by building them out of a list of component parts, both in your physical
inventory and in your virtual store.
Peachtree Premium for Distribution and Peachtree Premium for Manufacturing
editions also include work tickets to help track the build progress of an assem-
bled item. Work tickets contain information about what’s needed to build an
assembly and whether you have all the items available. You can use work tick-
ets to follow a build through its process, and you can check off the build steps
as they are completed.
Creating a bill of materials
The bill of materials is a list of the individual parts that make up assemblies.
Before you can create an assembly item, you need to make sure that each
component part is set up in Peachtree.
After you use an assembly on a transaction, you can’t add or remove compo-
nent items from the bill of materials unless you are using Peachtree Premium
for Manufacturing edition or Peachtree Premium for Distribution edition. If
you’re using any of the other editions, you need to create a new assembly
item to change component parts.
Create a bill of materials by following these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Inventory Items to display the Maintain Inventory
Items window.
2. Create the inventory item ID, description, and other information.
Make sure that you choose Assembly as the Item Class.
3. Click the Bill of Materials tab to display a screen like the one in 
Figure 11-6.
Because assemblies are made up of other components, you need to use
the Bill of Materials tab to list the component items. Assemblies must
have at least one component (Item ID) listed in the bill of materials.
211
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

4. Select or enter the first item to be included in the assembly.
Peachtree automatically fills in the description, but you can change the
description.
5. Enter a Quantity Needed to build one assembly.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for each component item.
If you run out of lines on the bill of materials list and have additional
components, click the Add button. Peachtree inserts a blank line above
the current item.
7. If you want Peachtree to print the list of the individual components on
the invoice, check the Print Components on Invoice box.
8. Click Save to save the assembly item.
Building assemblies
When you build an assembly item, Peachtree takes the individual components
and reduces their quantity on hand. Peachtree does not allow negative compo-
nent quantities when building assemblies. Therefore, you need enough compo-
nent parts in stock to build the requested number of assemblies.
When building an assembly, Peachtree generates a debit entry for the assem-
bly’s inventory GL account and credits the component’s inventory GL account
for the cost of the assembly items.

Follow these steps to build assemblies:
1. Choose Tasks➪Assemblies.
2. In the Item ID lookup box, select the assembly item ID.
Peachtree displays each assembly component along with the current
quantity on hand.
3. In the Reference box, enter an optional reference number or any
piece of information to identify this transaction, perhaps your initials.
Peachtree doesn’t require reference numbers, but making sure that
every transaction you enter into Peachtree has some type of a reference
number is a good idea.
4. Choose the transaction date, which is typically the date the changes in
your inventory occurred.
5. Select an Action to Build or Unbuild the assembly.
You might want to “unbuild” an assembly, for example, if you need to
sell the individual components.
6. Enter the build or unbuild Quantity.
Whether you’re building or unbuilding, enter a positive number. As you
enter the quantity you want to build, the assembly New Qty on Hand
amount changes, as well as the component quantity required. If you’re
unbuilding assemblies, Peachtree shows the component item quantity
returned to stock.
7. Enter a Reason to build the assemblies.
You don’t have to enter a reason. No doubt, you know exactly right now
why you’re building them, but will you remember six months from now?
Optionally, select an employee name from the Supervisor list. The
Supervisor is the person overseeing the assembly build or unbuild.
8. Click Save to record the transaction.
Making Inventory Adjustments
Let’s face it; inventory counts get out of whack sometimes. Items get dam-
aged, lost, or stolen. Sometimes, for reasons unknown, you might find several
products that you didn’t know you had, stashed away in a corner. So periodi-
cally, you’ll need to adjust your inventory.
213
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

Whether you take a physical inventory count of all your goods, or just need
to adjust the quantity on hand of a single product, you use Peachtree’s
Inventory Adjustment feature.
Follow these steps to make adjustments to your inventory:
1. Choose Tasks➪Inventory Adjustments to display the Inventory
Adjustments window you see in Figure 11-7.
2. Enter a Reference number or any piece of information to identify this
transaction, perhaps your initials.
Peachtree doesn’t require reference numbers, but making sure that
every transaction you enter into Peachtree has some type of a reference
number is a good idea.
3. Select a Date for the inventory adjustment.
4. If you use Peachtree’s job costing, select the job (and optionally, the
phase or cost code) to which you want to charge the adjustment.
Chapter 12 tells you all about job costing.
5. Choose the GL Source Account you want to charge for the adjustment
cost.
If you decrease the item quantity, Peachtree debits the GL Source Account
and credits the Inventory Account you listed in the Maintain Inventory
Items window for the item. If you increase the item quantity, Peachtree
credits the GL Source Account and debits the item’s Inventory Account.
6. Enter a Unit Cost.
The Unit Cost defaults to the last purchase price you entered in the
system. If you use the Inventory Adjustment transaction to increase your
inventory count, you can change the unit cost. If you’re reducing the
quantity on hand, however, the unit cost field becomes disabled.
Peachtree determines the cost of the adjustment based on the item’s
costing method at the time of the adjustment.

The unit cost is very important! Not putting in a cost can throw off your
entire inventory valuation.
7. In the Adjust Quantity By box, type a quantity to adjust.
You enter the quantity as a negative number if you need to decrease
your quantity on hand. Peachtree displays the new quantity on hand.
8. Optionally, in the Reason to Adjust box, describe why you’re creating
the transaction (for example, damaged or annual inventory).
You may know quite well why you’re creating this adjustment, but will
you remember later?
9. Click Save to save the transaction.
Adjusting Prices
One day you suddenly realize you haven’t raised the prices on your products
for a long time. Your costs have gone up and you know you have to pass some
of that increase on to your customers. We know this isn’t a step you take
lightly. After all, you still want to be competitive, but you are in the business
to make money, not lose it. So you make the decision to increase your prices.
Originally, you entered the sales prices when you created the inventory item
in the Maintain Inventory Items window. You could go back to the Maintain
Inventory Items window and pull each item up individually, change the sales
prices, and then save the inventory item again.
Oh no, you say! I have too many inventory items to change the prices individu-
ally. Isn’t there a faster way? Yes. Peachtree provides an easy way to update
prices on all your inventory items, a range of items, or a single item. For exam-
ple, you can mark up sales prices for all your stock items by 10 percent. You
can even adjust the prices for only the products you purchase from a specific
vendor. Peachtree allows you to adjust the item sales prices up or down.
Make a backup before you change item prices.
To adjust sales prices, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Item Prices to display the Maintain Item Prices –
Filter Selection dialog box you see in Figure 11-8.
2. Enter any desired filter information.
The Filter Selection box gives you lots of different ways to select the
products that need a price increase. If you don’t choose any settings
from the filter box, Peachtree assumes you want to change the price of
all your products. However, you can select just stock items, or stock
215
Chapter 11: Counting Your Stuff

items you purchase from vendor JONES-01, or only the products that cost
more than $10 but less than $50, or . . . you get the idea. You can select
any of these combinations from the Filter Selection box. In Figure 11-9, 
we changed the price on only our plastic birdbaths.
3. Click OK to display the Maintain Item Prices window, shown in 
Figure 11-9.
4. Because Peachtree assumes that you want to change all ten pricing
levels, you have to remove the check mark next to each price level
that you do not want to change.
Now you have to make some decisions regarding your method of adjust-
ment. Do you want to adjust your price levels manually or through 
calculations?

5. Select an adjustment method:
• Level’s current calculation and new cost information: Selected
price levels and items that use cost or level one in calculating the
price are recalculated based on the current cost or the updated
level-one price.
• Level’s default calculation: Each price level and item selected are
recalculated using the calculation in Inventory Item Defaults. This
method overrides any customized calculations you may have set
up for individual items in Maintain Inventory Items.
• Calculation selected below: If you’re using a calculation for chang-
ing your prices, select the Calculation selected below method and
then click the Use arrow and choose an adjustment method: Current
Price or Last Cost. Some companies mark up their products by a flat
percentage, say 25 percent over cost. In that case, they’d select the
Last Cost option. If you want to increase the current sales price, say
a $1.00 item that you now want to sell it for $1.15, you’d choose the
Current Price option.
6. If you selected the Calculation selected below method, follow Steps 7
and 8. If not, jump ahead to Step 9.
7. Choose a markup method and enter an amount or percentage to mark
up the item.
Peachtree allows you to change prices on the selected items by an
amount or a percentage. If you choose Amount, enter the amount as 
a positive or negative dollar amount. If you choose Percent, enter the
amount as a positive or negative percentage (for example, enter 6 for 
a 6-percent markup).
Enter a negative number if you want to mark down the current price.
When you modify and save the calculation method in the Item Prices
box, Peachtree retains that calculation as the default for the item in
Maintain Inventory Items.
8. Select a method for rounding the new prices:
• Next Dollar: Peachtree rounds the item prices up to the nearest
dollar amount. For example, if you increased the price of a product
you previously sold for $11.60 by 15 percent, the calculated price
is $13.34, but Peachtree rounds the new price up to $14.00.
• Specific Cent: Use this if you want to round all prices up to a speci-
fied cent level. For example, at a 95-cent price level your products
would sell for 5.95, 7.95, 11.95, and so on. If you choose Specific
Cent, specify the cents (95 in our example) in the Amount box.
• Do Not Round: Select this if you don’t want the prices rounded.
217

9. Click the Recalc toolbar button to see the new item prices, or you can
manually change individual prices.
Click the Detail button to display additional information about an 
item or click the Print button to print a report of your proposed price
adjustments.
10. Click Save to record the new prices.
11. Click Close to close the Maintain Item Prices dialog box.
When Does Peachtree Assign 
a Cost to Items?
We’ll be honest here. This section is Boring with a capital B. You certainly
don’t have to read this information, but our experience shows that many
clients want to know how Peachtree’s inventory system works — not just the
mechanics of entering items or transactions, but what’s happening behind
the scenes. We don’t give you any steps or tasks to accomplish — just some
plain old facts about inventory.
This whole inventory state of affairs can be confusing. You’ve probably already
noticed that Peachtree’s inventory module is perfect for a buy/sell situation,
where you purchase a product and then resell it, but it doesn’t work very well
for tracking raw materials used in production, especially if scrap is involved.
Add that factor to all the different item transactions that can affect the cost,
and sometimes the entire picture becomes blurred.
Peachtree calculates the value of inventory items on a daily basis. To ensure
that increases to inventory are posted before decreases to inventory,
Peachtree posts transactions in the following order:
1. Purchases
2. Payments
3. Increase adjustments
4. Assembly builds (for an assembly item)
5. Sales returns
6. Receipts return
7. Assembly unbuilds (for a component item)
218
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

8. Purchase returns
9. Payment returns
10. Assembly unbuilds (for an assembly item)
11. Sales
12. Receipts
13. Decrease adjustments
14. Assembly builds (for a component item)
Peachtree creates three types of system-generated adjustments: the purchase
return adjustment, the assembly unbuild adjustment, and the system cost
adjustment. You can’t erase these types of adjustments. They appear in the
Inventory Adjustment Journal and on the Item Costing Report. The reference
for a system cost adjustment is SysCost, the reference for a purchase return
adjustment is the reference number of the purchase transaction (usually the
invoice number), and the reference for the assembly unbuild adjustment is
the reference number of the assembly unbuild transaction.
Figure 11-10 shows an inventory adjustment journal with a system-generated
cost (SysCost) adjustment.

Reporting on Your Inventory
Here comes the spiel you may have seen in many other chapters. . . . While it
would be nice to print a sample of every report Peachtree offers, (especially
in this chapter because Peachtree has a number of valuable inventory
reports), there simply isn’t space in this book to do so. So, in Table 11-2, we

which shows the quantity on hand, value, average cost, and percent of inven-
tory value for all in-stock items. To arrive at the percent of inventory value
number, Peachtree takes the value of the item divided by the total value of
items that have a positive item value. The example in Table 11-3 shows you
how the percent-to-total value works.

In Table 11-3, Peachtree calculates the percent of inventory on the percent 
of the positive item values (items 1 and 3), which equal $10.00 + $20.00, or
$30.00.

Tracking Project Costs
In This Chapter
 Creating estimates and jobs
 Creating phase codes and cost codes
 Using jobs for invoicing
S
ome businesses lend themselves well to organizing work by projects, 
and for the purposes of this discussion, project is synonymous with job.
In particular, these companies perform the same general type of work for 
each customer — that is, all their projects are similar. Companies who use job 
costing (assigning costs to jobs) in their business want to track expenses and
revenues for each job so that they can determine the net profit from the job.
These companies often bid for the services they sell by providing an estimate.
Then, if they get the work, they want to compare the estimated costs to the
actual costs so that they can improve their estimating skills for future jobs
and increase revenues.
In this chapter, we describe the job costing features available in Peachtree
Premium and Peachtree Complete. In Peachtree Accounting, you can create
jobs but not phases or cost codes, which are fields that enable you to cap-
ture more details about jobs. Peachtree First Accounting doesn’t support job
costing.
Understanding Job Costing
What kinds of companies use job costing? Well, job costing is widely used in
the construction industry, but it also can be used by a variety of other busi-
nesses, such as convention planners, party planners, landscapers, cleaning
services, and printers (the people who produce things like letterhead).
Do you need to use job costing? If the jobs you perform tend to stretch out
over time, you’re more likely to use job costing. However, if you complete a
job in a short period of time — a week or less — you probably don’t need to
use Peachtree’s job costing, because the time you’d spend entering job infor-
mation would exceed the value you’d receive from that information.

Creating custom fields for jobs
In Chapter 4, we set up defaults for other areas of Peachtree; for jobs, you
can establish only custom fields because this feature has no other prefer-
ences to set. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Jobs to display the Job
Defaults dialog box. Place a check mark next to any of the five field labels to
enable the custom field. Then type a label description for each custom field.
Click OK when you’re finished.
Reviewing job examples
Before you dive in and start creating things, we think you’d benefit by exam-
ining a few examples. We think that you might better understand the order in
which we choose to create things after you read these examples.
Jobs are a method of organizing accounting information. Throughout this
chapter, we explain the various facets of jobs by using one example: a com-
pany that builds swimming pools. Consider each swimming pool the com-
pany builds to be a separate job.
Phases
You can use phases to further break down the costs of a project. Phases are
optional; use them only if you want to organize your project in some way and
look at costs and revenues at a more detailed level. In the case of our swim-
ming pool builder, we might use five phases:
 Design
 Permits
 Site preparation
 Installation
 Finishing/landscaping
Peachtree allows you to assign each phase to a cost type: Labor, Materials,
Subcontract Labor, Equipment Rental, and Other.
Cost codes
If you need a further breakdown of any of these cost types for a particular
phase — for example, you may need to track the costs of specific materials
such as concrete and tile — you can create cost codes. If you choose to create
cost codes for a phase, you won’t assign a cost type to the phase. Instead,
you can assign a cost type to each cost code: Labor, Materials, Subcontract
Labor, Equipment Rental, and Other.
224
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

Cost codes, like phases, are optional. You may find that you need cost codes
for only one cost type, perhaps Labor. You can set up specific cost codes for
Material, such as tile, lumber, and concrete, and then assign those cost codes
as needed to phases. For phases that don’t need a cost code, you can simply
use the phase — and its cost type.
If you use cost codes, we recommend that you try to use the same ones for
every project. That way, you can set up one set of cost codes and assign them,
as needed, to any phase of any project. You may also be able to use the same
phases (or a subset of phases) for each project.
Consider one more example. Suppose that you manage an apartment complex,
and you want to monitor the costs associated with each building on the prop-
erty. You could set up each building as a job. Then, as you make purchases for
a particular building, you can assign the purchases to that building. Your job
reports show you the costs of each building in the complex. Note that we
haven’t suggested using phases or cost codes because they’re optional.
Suppose, however, that you want to track costs for the complex at a more
detailed level — by apartment. In that case, you could set up the apartments
in each building as phases and assign expenses to particular apartments.
“So what’s your point? Why are you telling me all this now?” you ask. Well,
when setting up a job in Peachtree, you must decide whether the job uses
phases. Similarly, when setting up a phase you must decide whether the
phase uses cost codes. You need to understand what each entity is so that
you know what to create and the order in which to create things.
Coding Costs
To create a cost code, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Job Costs➪Cost Codes to display the Maintain Cost
Codes window (see Figure 12-1).
2. In the Cost Code ID box, type an ID (up to 20 alphanumeric characters).
3. In the Description box, type a description for the cost code.
4. Select a cost type for the cost code to categorize it in a general way.
You can select Labor, Materials, Equipment Rental, Subcontractors, or
Other.
5. Click the Save button.
225
Chapter 12: Tracking Project Costs

Repeat these steps to set up other cost codes you need for your jobs.
If you no longer need a cost code, you can mark it inactive. To do so, redis-
play the cost code in the Maintain Cost Codes window and add a check mark
to the Inactive box.
Establishing Phases
To create a phase, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Job Costs➪Phases to display the Maintain Phases
window (see Figure 12-2).
2. In the Phase ID box, type an ID (up to 20 alphanumeric characters).
3. In the Description box, type a description for the phase.
4. Decide whether to use cost codes:
• If you plan to use cost codes for the phase, place a check mark in
the Use Cost Codes box. Peachtree disables the ability to select a
cost type.
Figure 12-2:
Create a
phase that
uses cost
codes.
Figure 12-1:

226
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

• If you don’t plan to use cost codes, choose a cost type for the
phase to categorize it in a general way. You can select Labor,
Materials, Equipment Rental, Subcontractors, or Other.
5. Click the Save button.
Repeat these steps to set up other phases you need for your jobs.
If you no longer need a phase, you can mark it inactive. To do so, redisplay
the phase in the Maintain Phases window and add a check mark to the
Inactive box.
Creating Jobs and Estimates
To set up a job, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Job Costs➪Jobs to display the Maintain Jobs
window (see Figure 12-3).
2. Type the job ID.
You can use up to 20 alphanumeric characters, excluding the asterisk
(*), the question mark (?), and the plus sign (+). IDs are case sensitive,
so POOL-1, for example, is different from pool-1.
3. In the Description box, provide a description for the job.
4. If the job uses phases, place a check mark in the Use Phases check box.
5. On the General tab, fill in any pertinent information, all of which is
optional.
Figure 12-3:
Set up a job

227
Chapter 12: Tracking Project Costs

Peachtree doesn’t limit the number of jobs you can assign to customers,
but you don’t need to assign jobs to customers. If you don’t need jobs
for any reason other than charging customers for expenses, you can use
time and expense slips. See Chapter 10 for details.
6. If you work on the job before you enter it in Peachtree and you have
historical revenues and expenses for the job, do the following:
You may want to read the next two steps before entering beginning bal-
ances. If you choose to use phases and cost codes with your job, you
can follow these steps to enter beginning balances by phase and cost
code.
a. Click the Beginning Balances button to display the Job Beginning
Balances window.
b. Use the Job Entries tab to enter beginning balances. From the
Job Balances tab, you can view the beginning balance of all jobs in
the system.
c. Enter a date for the balance you intend to enter and a beginning
balance in either the Expenses column or the Revenues column.
Make sure that you enter the difference between revenues and
expenses. If you subtract expenses from revenues, and the number
is positive, enter it in the Revenues column; if the difference is neg-
ative, enter the amount in the Expenses column.
d. When you finish entering beginning balances, click Save to
redisplay the Maintain Jobs window.
7. Click the Custom Fields tab of the Maintain Jobs window to supply
information for enabled custom fields.
Make sure that you enter the difference between revenues and expenses.
If you subtract expenses from revenues and the number is positive,
enter it in the Revenues column; if the difference is negative, enter the
amount in the Expenses column.
You can enter balances for more than one date.
8. When you finish entering beginning balances, click Save to redisplay
the Maintain Jobs window.
9. Click the Custom Fields tab of the Maintain Jobs window to supply
information for enabled custom fields.
10. Click the Estimated Exp./Rev. tab and use the Lookup list indicators
(the magnifying glass) to enter estimated expenses and revenues.
These estimates are optional. In Figure 12-4, you see the Estimated
Exp./Rev. tab for a job that uses phases. If you don’t use phases with
your job, you see only two boxes: one for total estimated expenses and
one for total estimated revenues.
11. Click Save to store the job’s information.
228

When you complete a job, you can mark it inactive. To do so, redisplay the
job in the Maintain Jobs window and add a check mark to the Inactive box.

Chapter 12: Tracking Project Costs
Job reports and masking
Some of the job reports enable you to filter jobs
using a job mask, which can be useful if you
have several different characteristics about
each job that you want to track. For one type of
information you want to track, you can use the
Job Type field. For the rest, you can use a
coding scheme for the Job ID. Suppose, for
example, that you work in three cities — Tampa,
St. Petersburg, and Clearwater — doing design,
planting, and maintenance. You also want to dif-
ferentiate jobs for residential and commercial
customers. You can use the Job Type field to
store the information about design, planting,
and maintenance. Then you can create a
coding scheme for the job ID that will enable
you to use masking to print reports that display
information on a subset of jobs. In the example,
you might want to create a ten-character Job
ID that is composed of one character (T, S, or C)
representing the city, one character (C or R)
representing commercial or residential, four
characters representing the customer’s name,
and four characters representing a job number.
On most job reports, you can filter by Job Type
and then mask for Tampa jobs by typing
T********* in the Job Mask field. You could
mask for commercial jobs in Clearwater by
typing CC******** or residential jobs in St.
Petersburg by typing SR********. To use the
mask, you supply asterisks for the characters
that can change; the total number of characters
you type is equal to the length of the job ID.

Assigning Jobs to Transactions
Okay, you’ve set up jobs (and maybe phases and cost codes, too). Now you
can use them when you create purchases and invoices.
Purchasing
Suppose that you’re buying something to use on a job and you want to assign
the expense to the job. To do so, you use the Purchase Orders window, the
Purchases/Receive Inventory window, or the Payments window. The method
is the same, regardless of the window you choose. In the following steps, we
show you the process in the Purchases/Receive Inventory window:
1. Choose Tasks➪Purchases/Receive Inventory to display the Purchases/
Receive Inventory window (see Figure 12-5).
2. Fill in the purchase information at the top of the window as you
would for any purchase.
3. In the bottom portion of the window, enter the information for the
item that you’re purchasing.
You can’t purchase a stock inventory item to use on a job. If you already
own a stock item that you want to use on a job, you can enter an inven-
tory adjustment (see Chapter 11), or you can place the item on the cus-
tomer’s invoice. If you invoice the customer, you don’t need to make the
inventory adjustment.
Figure 12-5:
Assign a 
job to a
purchase of
anything 
but stock

items.
230
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

4. In the Job column, use the lookup list indicator (this time it looks like
a file folder) to assign the line to a job.
If the job uses phases or cost codes, you see a folder in the list repre-
senting the job. You need to double-click the folder to open it and select
the appropriate phase or cost code.
As you can see in Figure 12-4, when you open the Job list, the box par-
tially overlays the Amount box. (For details on filling in a purchase, see
Chapter 5.)
5. Continue entering lines as needed; you can include lines that you
assign to jobs and lines that you don’t assign to jobs on the same 
purchase.
6. Click the Save button to save the purchase.
Invoicing customers
By default, Peachtree sets up purchases you assign to jobs as reimbursable
expenses that you can include on an invoice to a customer. You also can
choose not to include these reimbursable expenses on customer bills.
Follow these steps to work with reimbursable expenses generated by assign-
ing jobs to purchases or payments:
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales/Invoicing to display the Sales/Invoicing window.
2. Fill in the invoice information at the top of the window as you would
for any invoice.
For details on filling in an invoice, see Chapter 7.
3. In the bottom portion of the window, enter one line of information for
each of the items that you’re selling.
4. In the Job column, use the list box selector (it looks like a file folder)
to assign the lines to a job, as appropriate.
5. To include a reimbursable expense on an invoice, click the Apply
Tickets/Expenses button in the lower-left corner of the window to 
display the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses window (see 
Figure 12-6).
You won’t know if reimbursable expenses exist for a customer until you
click the Apply Tickets/Expenses button.
6. Click the Reimbursable Expenses tab to see expenses you entered and
assigned to a job in the Purchases/Inventory window and the
Payments window.
(If you ignored our advice and assigned an expense to a job in the Write
Checks window, that expense will also appear on the Reimbursable
Expenses tab.)
231
Chapter 12: Tracking Project Costs

7. To include a reimbursable expense on the invoice, click the Use check
box next to that reimbursable expense.
8. To build some profit into a reimbursable expense, change the amount
in the Invoice Amt column.
To mark up or down a group of reimbursable expenses, click the
WriteUp toolbar button to display the Select Reimbursables to Write
Up/Down dialog box, where you can identify reimbursable expenses to
mark up by either a dollar amount or a percentage.
If you change your mind after marking up reimbursable expenses, you can
click the Remove WriteUp button that appears immediately to the right of the
WriteUp button. (We know it’s confusing, because they both seem to be
called WriteUp, but you can point your mouse at each button to display a
ToolTip that describes each button’s function. The Remove WriteUp button’s
image is the universal “No” sign.)
When you use reimbursable expenses, keep these points in mind:
 You can delete reimbursable expenses from the Apply Tickets/
Reimbursable Expenses window if you decide not to bill the client for
them. Place a check mark in the Del box to the right of the expense.
Deleting the reimbursable expense does not delete the transaction that
created the reimbursable expense. Instead, deleting in the Apply
Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses window breaks the tie between the
reimbursable expense and the customer.
WriteUp button
Figure 12-6:

232
Part II: The Daily Drudge 

You can’t undo deleting here. After you delete a reimbursable expense,
the connection between the reimbursable expense and the customer is
permanently broken unless you erase the purchase or payment that cre-
ated the reimbursable expense and reenter it.
 Be aware that deleting or using a reimbursable expense makes it disap-
pear from the Apply Tickets/Reimbursable Expenses window. If you use
a reimbursable expense and subsequently delete the line from the
invoice, the reimbursable expense does not reappear in the window. If
you mistakenly use a reimbursable expense and post the invoice, delete
the invoice and reenter it.
 You can edit a reimbursable expense you intend to bill to a customer by
editing the purchase or payment that assigns the expense to a job. To
find the transaction, open the window where you first created it — for
example, the Purchases/Receive Inventory window — and click the Edit
button.
Adding Overhead to a Job
To run your business, you incur certain expenses that accountants call 
overhead — expenses such as telephone, postage, and electricity. You can
think of overhead expenses as expenses you incur even if you don’t sell 
anything. (Of course, you wouldn’t incur overhead for long if you didn’t 
sell anything, because you’d go out of business, but you get our drift.)
If your company uses job costing, you probably want to divide your overhead
and assign it to jobs. There’s no standard method to do this in Peachtree, but
you can do it. The method we’re going to describe assumes that you know
the amount of overhead to add to each job. It could be a percentage of the
expenses you incur or an hourly rate. If you don’t know, you need to ask your
accountant to figure out the overhead burden rate for you.
After you have the rate from your accountant, you need to know your expenses
by job so that you can apply the overhead burden rate to each job.
We suggest that you customize the Job Ledger report (choose Reports➪Jobs
and select the Job Ledger report). On the Fields tab, include the following
fields: Job ID, Job Description, Phase ID, Cost Code ID, Transaction Date,
Transaction Description, Actual Expenses, and Hours with Totals. When you
print the report, you have all the information you need to apply the burden
rate to your expenses and then assign the overhead to various jobs. You
might want to export the report to Excel and calculate the burden amount
there (you know, burden rate times expense amount). For more information
on customizing reports, see Chapter 14.
233
Chapter 12: Tracking Project Costs

Okay. Now that you’ve calculated the overhead amount, enter the amount
into Peachtree using a journal entry.
For this task, you need a suspense account. We use a suspense account to
handle amounts that are temporary in nature. You can set up a suspense
account as any kind of account: asset, liability, income, or expense. But we
suggest that you make it an account you’re likely to notice if it appears on
reports because, ultimately, your suspense account shouldn’t have a balance.
For help in creating an account, see Chapter 3.
To assign overhead to a job, you make a journal entry. Don’t worry — it’s
easy. (For more details on entering journal entries, see Chapter 17.) Follow
these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪General Journal Entry to display the General Journal
Entry window (see Figure 12-7).
2. Supply a Date and a Reference number for the journal entry, and
ignore the Reverse Transaction check box.
3. Supply two lines for every overhead amount you want to assign,
choosing the Suspense account on both lines.
4. Assign the job to the Debit line, not the Credit line.
5. Click Save to save the entry.
This journal entry debits and credits the same account, which makes the
entry have no effect on your books. However, assigning the job to the debit
side of the transaction allocates the overhead expense to the job.

journal entry

The Fancy Stuff

In this part . . .
I
n this part, we cover many of the tasks you don’t do
every day. First, we show you how to customize
Peachtree to make it work your way. Then we show 
you how to customize forms and produce and modify
reports — after all, you put information into Peachtree, so
you should be able to get it out and see the effects of your
business habits. Then we cover reconciling the bank state-
ment and the stuff you do monthly, quarterly, or annually.
We also provide some real–life situations encountered by
people just like you and ways you might handle similar 
situations.
Last, we show you how to easily keep your accounting
information safe — a very important chapter. Why?
Because you spend so much time putting stuff into
Peachtree that it would be criminal to lose it just because
your hard drive crashes or your office is robbed.

Chapter 13
Working with Forms
In This Chapter
 Previewing and printing forms
 E-Mailing your forms
 Customizing your forms
I
t’s important to understand the differences among the types of informa-
tion you produce with Peachtree. Peachtree provides three types of docu-
ments: forms, reports, and financial statements. In this chapter, we discuss
forms, which Peachtree defines as documents you exchange with your cus-
tomers, vendors, or employees. You print these documents on preprinted
forms or on blank paper. 
Reports are typically specific to a module such as Accounts Payable or Payroll
and provide feedback about one or more customers, vendors, employees, or
inventory items. Financial statements tell you the overall value of your com-
pany and whether the company as a whole made or lost money. You can find
out about reports in Chapter 14 and financial statements in Chapter 15. 
You print forms on preprinted forms or on blank paper. You can purchase
preprinted forms from your local printer, or you can use the offers you receive
in your Peachtree software box. Chapter 21 lists Web contact information on a
couple of sources for forms: Deluxe Forms and Peachtree Forms. 
If you contact Deluxe Forms at 1-800-328-0304 and reference this book and
discount code R03578, you’ll receive 20 percent off your first order.
Printing Forms
You use essentially the same steps for printing all forms whether you’re print-
ing a quote, a purchase order, a check, or a customer invoice. Peachtree can
print your forms one at a time or together in a batch. Peachtree also includes
forms for printing customer, vendor, and employee labels as well as collec-
tion letters, 1099s, and various payroll forms such as W2s and 941 reports.

A variety of forms are available, and you can customize any form.
Previewing forms in the document window
Because Peachtree has several forms, you may want to see what your quote,
purchase order, check, or invoice would look like in each form. You can use
the Preview feature to examine the transaction:
1. Display the transaction you want to preview on the screen.
If necessary, click the Open button and select a previously posted 
transaction.
2. Click the drop-down arrow on the Print button and choose Preview. 
The Preview Forms dialog box appears, listing the available forms (see
Figure 13-1). The forms listed vary depending on the transaction type.
3. If you want to change the form, do the following:
a. Click the Change Form button.
Peachtree assumes that you want to use the same form you used
the last time you printed, but the Change Form button lets you
select a different form. The Preview Forms dialog box appears.
b. Select the form you want to print and then click OK.
c. Click Preview.

4. Click anywhere on the form to enlarge the view; click a second time
to enlarge the view even more (see Figure 13-2).
No need to strain your eyes. Whenever the mouse pointer turns into a
magnifying glass, you can click to zoom in or out on the form — this fea-
ture works also in reports. See Chapter 14 for more information on
reports.
You can click the Close button if you need to make changes to the trans-
action. Peachtree redisplays the transaction window.
5. To print the transaction on the selected form, click Print.
Peachtree prints the form, saves the transaction, and returns you to a
blank transaction window.
Printing from the document window
In the preceding section, you discover how to preview and then print a docu-
ment from the preview window. If you don’t want to preview the document,
you can print directly from the data entry window.

Chapter 13: Working with Forms

To print a form, follow these steps:
1. With a document displayed in the window, click the Print button (or
press Ctrl+P).
You’ll see the Print Forms dialog box, like the one shown previously in
Figure 13-1.
2. Verify the transaction number, printer, number of copies, and form
name. 
If you did not manually enter a transaction number in the data entry
screen, Peachtree automatically uses the next number.
Peachtree maintains a different series of numbers for each form type.
For example, checks have a different numbering system from purchase
orders or customer invoices.
To test the form alignment, click the Practice button to print practice
forms. You’ll see Xs and 9s on the form where words and numbers will
appear.
3. Click Print.
Peachtree automatically saves a transaction after printing. Saving a
transaction posts the transaction and, if applicable, updates the general
ledger as well.
Printing forms in a batch
Sometimes, when you’re entering data such as invoices, you don’t want to
stop and go through the steps to print each invoice separately. In this case,
you may like Peachtree’s batch printing feature. If you want to print several
invoices at the same time, create each invoice without assigning an invoice
number and then click Save. Then, whenever you’re ready to print your trans-
action, Peachtree can print all unnumbered invoices at the same time. You
can batch print any form except receipts and deposit tickets.
The following steps show you how you can batch print forms such as state-
ments, quotes, sales orders, purchase orders, and both A/P and P/R checks:
1. Click Reports and select an area. 
2. Select the type of form.
You can find forms in four report areas: Accounts Receivable, Accounts
Payable, Payroll, and Mail Merge. (We cover mail merge in Chapter 14.)
242
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Peachtree displays reports with an icon that looks like a piece of paper
with lines on it and displays forms in small folders. Forms are at the
bottom of the list.
3. Click the forms folder to open it and display a list of forms.
4. Double-click the form you want to print.
Peachtree displays an options dialog box specific to the form you
selected. (See Figure 13-3.) The dialog box appearance varies according
to the chosen form.
You can select a forms printing method also from the Print dialog box
and select to send only e-mailed forms, only paper forms, or both.
Peachtree looks at the default method for sending forms assigned to
each vendor (Chapter 5) or customer (Chapter 7). The next section
shows you how Peachtree handles e-mailing forms.
5. Verify the beginning transaction number, printer, number of copies,
and form name, and then click OK. 
After printing the forms, Peachtree displays a dialog box asking whether
the forms printed properly. 
6. Answer the dialog box by clicking Yes or No.
If you click Yes, Peachtree assigns the numbers to the forms. If you click
No, the forms remain unnumbered, and you need to reprint them.

Chapter 13: Working with Forms

E-Mailing Forms
Some customers or vendors prefer that you e-mail their forms rather than
making the trek to the mailbox (or even worse, the post office). You can
e-mail forms in a batch, or many transaction windows allow you to send
e-mail copies in replace of or in addition to paper forms. Peachtree provides
a place to store an e-mail address in the Maintain Customer or the Maintain
Vendor screen. You have the option of e-mailing the form to the stored
address or to one you type in. 
Most forms are eligible for e-mailing. You can e-mail invoices, statements, col-
lection letters, sales orders, and purchase orders. You can’t e-mail deposit
tickets, receipts, customer or vendor labels, any payroll forms, and for obvi-
ous reasons, vendor or payroll checks.
To generate e-mail in Peachtree, you must have a MAPI-compliant, default
e-mail application installed on your computer. If your default e-mail system is
AOL, you will not be able to send e-mail alerts from Peachtree because AOL is
not a fully MAPI-compliant e-mail application.
During batch printing, if you are e-mailing forms, Peachtree provides several
additional options. The E-mail tab, available with most forms, addresses how
you want Peachtree to manage the printing. You decide if you want to e-mail
only the form, e-mail the form plus generate a paper copy for your records,
and a few other options. To see the options, click the E-mail tab of the form
option window. (See Figure 13-4.)

244
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

If you’re not batch printing the forms you want to e-mail, you need to display
the transaction:
1. In the transaction window, for example, the Sales/Invoicing window,
choose File➪E-mail or click the E-mail button. 
The E-Mail Forms window appears so that you can confirm the transac-
tion number and the form name.
2. Click Send. 
Peachtree launches your e-mail program and automatically inserts the
recipient information as stored in your customer or vendor file. If your
Peachtree options specified to send a copy to a sales or buyers represen-
tative, their e-mail information appears in the Cc: line (see Figure 13-5). 
3. If you want to change the recipients, type a different e-mail address or
click the address book icon and select a recipient from the address
book. 
4. Click Send.
When e-mailing a form, Peachtree sends the form as a PDF (Portable
Document Format) attachment. To view or print the form, the recipient must
have the Adobe Reader software, which is a free download from the Internet
at www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html. 
Customizing Forms
You can customize any form to better meet your needs. You can move, add,
or delete fields, change fonts, and even add graphical images.

Chapter 13: Working with Forms

Exploring the Form Designer
The Form Design window enables you to create customized forms or edit
existing forms to match the needs of your business. To use the Form
Designer, follow these steps:
1. Choose Reports➪Accounts Receivable or the report area for the form
you want to modify.
2. In the report list, locate and click the folder containing the form you
want to modify.
Because Peachtree lists forms after reports, you may need to scroll
down the Report List a bit (see Figure 13-6).
3. Click once on the form you want to modify and then click the Design
button.
The selected report appears in Form Design view (see Figure 13-7).
If you accidentally double-click the desired form, Peachtree assumes you
want to print it, not modify its design. It displays a dialog box containing filter
and format options you can set before printing. Click the Cancel button, and
be sure to click only once on the form you want to modify. Then you can click
the Design button.
Maximize the design window for optimal viewing.

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

The design window has two main parts: the toolbars and the design area,
which displays Peachtree data fields, text fields, and other objects such as
rectangles or pictures. Five toolbars appear on the design window. Each tool-
bar has a specific function:
 Alignment toolbar: Use this toolbar to line up two or more objects.
 Main toolbar: Use this toolbar to accomplish many common steps,
including saving the form and closing the design window.
 Object toolbar: Use this toolbar to add new objects to the window.
Use the Selection tool, the first tool on the Object toolbar, to select
objects that you want to move, modify, or delete.
 Properties toolbar: Use this toolbar to determine an object’s content,
size, order, position, and appearance.
 Cursor position toolbar: Use this toolbar to determine the location of
selected objects.

Chapter 13: Working with Forms

Everything on a form is a type of object. You can find data field objects, text
field objects, text objects, shaped objects, and even grouped objects. Take a
look at the first of two main object types you find on a form. A data field object
is the most common object you see on a form. Peachtree obtains information,
either from the Maintain window or from the Tasks window, and places it in
data fields. Peachtree indicates data field objects with XXX’s for words and
NNN’s for numbers.
The second most common form object is a text object. This is text that shows
specific words, such as “Sold to” or “Thank you for your business.” You can
easily identify text objects because you just read them on the screen.
To modify any type of object, you first need to select the object. “Okay,” you
say, “but how do I know which object to modify?” Well, you click any object
to select it. The object has eight small black box “handles” around it, and the
Properties toolbar indicates the name of the selected object.
Moving objects
You won’t throw your back out moving form design objects. You can move an
object by selecting it and dragging it to a new location. If you select the wrong
object, click anywhere in a blank area of the window to deselect the object.
You can move an object also by selecting it and using your arrow keys to
move it to a new position. This technique works well when you want to move
the object only a little bit.
Deleting objects
Deleting objects is easy, too. If you want to get rid of something on a form,
click the object to select it and then press the Delete key. Poof . . . it’s gone!
For example, if you don’t want the word Duplicate to print on a check to
which you have assigned a check number, delete the Duplicate Check
Message field in the check form you use.
If you delete the wrong object, immediately choose Edit➪Undo to reverse the
last step you took.
Adding data field objects
If you want to add data field objects to a form, you need to tell Peachtree
where you want to place the field and which field you want to add. To do so:
248
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

1. Click the Data button on the Object toolbar.
As you move your mouse over the form design area, the mouse pointer
turns into a thin, black cross.
2. Click the mouse at the approximate location where you want to place
the new data object, hold down the mouse button, and drag the mouse
to the right and slightly downward to draw the approximate size of
the object you want to add. 
The outline of the new object appears while your mouse is pressed. (See
Figure 13-8.) 
3. Release the mouse button.
The Data Object Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-9.
4. Click the Data Field Name drop-down list, and then click the field you
want to add.
You see only fields applicable to the current form. A little later in this
chapter, we show you how to modify any field.
5. Click OK to close the Data Object Properties dialog box and add the
object to your form.
Figure 13-8:
Draw an
imaginary
box to hold
the data.
249
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

Adding text objects
Data field objects contain variable information that will . . . well, vary, or
change from one document to the next. Text field objects are static. The
information won’t change; the same words appear on each and every docu-
ment that uses this form.
You add a text object pretty much the same way you add data fields.
1. Click the Text button on the Object toolbar.
As you move your mouse over the design area, the mouse pointer turns
into a thin, black cross.
2. Click the mouse at the approximate location where you want to place
the new text object, hold down the mouse button, and drag the mouse
to the right and slightly downward to draw the approximate size of
the text object you want to add. 
3. Release the mouse button.
The Text Object Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-10.
4. Enter the text you want to appear on the form. 
If you need a second line, press Ctrl+Enter to move the insertion point to
the next line.
5. Click OK to add the next text object to your form.

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Resizing an object
If an object is too long, too short, too narrow, or too wide, resize it with your
mouse. 
Select the object you want to resize; then position the mouse over one of the
object “handles.” As you do so, the mouse pointer turns into a double-headed
black arrow. Then you drag the handle in the direction you want to resize the
object. As you drag the handle, you’ll see the box boundaries resize. When
you reach the desired size, release the mouse button.
Formatting field properties
With all those XXX’s and NNN’s on the screen, how do you know what a data
field looks like? Well, you examine the field properties. The properties tell
you what each field represents as well as its size and appearance. You can
modify properties for both data fields and text objects.
To view or modify object properties, you must first click the object you want to
modify. With the object selected, click the Properties button on the Properties
toolbar. Peachtree then displays the Object Properties dialog box.
Using the Object Properties dialog box, you can choose a specific font, size,
and color for each object, or you can change how you want numbers to print
when designing forms. We talk about numbers first.
Peachtree designates numbers that appear before the decimal point with a
capital N and numbers that appear after the decimal point with a lowercase
n. Suppose that you wanted standard decimal points and commas. Using
Figure 13-10:
Enter text
information
here.
251
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

NNN,NNN.nn as your template, one thousand would print as 1,000.00 and 
ten thousand would print as 10,000.00. To change the number format for 
the selected field, modify the template to match the appearance you want.
In Table 13-1, we show the values 1234.56 and –1234.56 using various formats.

(1,234.56)
To change the font for the selected object, follow these steps:
1. If a check mark appears in the Use Printer Font box in the Object
Properties dialog box, remove it by clicking the box, 
2. Click the font selection arrow located below the Use Printer Font box
The Font dialog box appears, allowing you to select a font type, style,
size, and color, as well as special effects.
3. Click OK after making your font selections.
4. When you finish using the Data Object Properties dialog box, click OK
to close it.
To make all objects the same font, press Ctrl+A to select all objects; then
right-click on top of a highlighted field and choose Font. In the Font dialog
box, select the font you want for the entire form, and click OK.
Aligning objects
When you select multiple objects in the Forms Design window, Peachtree can
align those objects in relation to each other. You can align their top, bottom,
left, or right edges together, or you can choose to align the centers vertically
or horizontally. To align multiple objects:
1. Click the Selection tool and then select the objects you want to align.
To select multiple objects, use Windows selection techniques and hold
the Shift or Ctrl keys and click each object you want to modify as a
group.
252
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

To select contiguous objects, hold down the Shift key and click the first
and last objects in the group you want to modify. To select noncontigu-
ous objects, hold down the Ctrl key and click each object.
2. Click a tool on the Alignment toolbar.
The objects align based on your choice.
When you’ve selected multiple objects to align them, how does Peachtree
determine which of the selected objects’ edges to use when aligning fields? If
you pay close attention, you’ll notice that all the selected objects have gray
handles, except the object you selected last, which has black handles.
Peachtree aligns the objects to the one with the black handles — we call it
the “foundation” object. Rule to remember: Select the foundation object last.
Grouping fields
When you have a series of rows of data, such as lines on an invoice, customer
statement, or purchase order, instead of creating each field individually, use
the Group command to list data fields displayed in columns and rows.
To create a group object, follow these steps:
1. Click the Group button on the Object toolbar.
2. Click the mouse at the approximate location where you want to place
the new group object, hold down the mouse button, and drag the
mouse to the right and slightly downward to specify the approximate
size of the group object you want to add. Release the mouse button.
The Group Object Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-11.
The Group Object Properties dialog box has several columns to help you
define the fields you want to include in the group table. The list of avail-
able fields in the Group Object Properties dialog box varies depending
on the type of form:
• Show Field: Check this box to include the data field in the group
table.
• Column Number: This option specifies the order in which the data
fields appear in the group table. You can’t change order directly
here; use the Move Field up- and down-arrow buttons to change
the column number.
• Field Name: Identify the fields included in the group table.
• Number Format: While this column is untitled in the Group Object
Properties box, it appears to the right of the Field Name column. In
numeric data fields, a number button (#) appears here. Clicking the
# button displays the Number Formatting window. (See “Formatting
field properties” earlier in this chapter.)
253
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

Click the Number Format button and add two or three spaces at
the end of the number signs. This adds some space between the
numbers and the group box borders. 
• Field Title: Peachtree calls the heading that prints for the column a
field title. You can change this option for any of the data fields or
leave it blank.
• Column Width: You can enter a column width to three decimal
places.
• Title Alignment: This aligns the title within the column.
You can set other options for your grouped object, including row spac-
ing, the font for the data or headings, and whether to define a border to
print around the grouped object.
By checking the Row Spacing box, you can define the spacing between
rows of data fields in the Group object. The value you enter determines
additional space between data rows. You can enter any amount from –
10 to 100. For example, if you use a 10-point font for data and you want
the data rows double-spaced, enter a 10 in the Row Spacing box.
3. Make your group object selections and then click OK.
Peachtree places the grouped object on your page.

Saving forms
After you’ve modified a form, you’ll want to save it. In fact, we recommend
that you save the form as you’re modifying it. Then resave it again every few
steps or so. To save a form:
1. Click the Save button to display the Save As dialog box.
2. Enter a name for the form.
You can’t use the same name as one of Peachtree’s standard forms. You
must give your form a unique name.
3. Optionally, in the Description box, type a description of the form.
4. Click Save to save the form for future use.
Peachtree identifies custom forms by a red flag on the form icon.
Delete any customized form by highlighting the form name in the Select a
Report window (refer to Figure 13-6) and clicking the Delete button.
We would have loved to include a discussion of Shapes, Commands, Field
Order, and Graphical objects. Unfortunately, these topics are beyond the
scope of this book, but you can find information about them in your
Peachtree Users Guide.

P
eachtree includes almost 100 standard reports, ranging from a list of your
chart of accounts to a check register to a job profitability report. In each
chapter in Part II, you find a list of the standard reports Peachtree supplies
appropriate to the subject of the chapter. In this chapter, we show you how to
print those reports to your screen, your printer, a PDF file, e-mail or an Excel
workbook. We also show you how to modify and save reports. We even show
you how to merge information with Microsoft Word.
Previewing Standard Reports
Save a tree! You may find that you want to take only a brief look at your infor-
mation. Peachtree allows you to print any report to the screen before or
instead of printing it on paper. 
To preview reports on your screen, follow these steps:
1. Choose Reports and then select the module you need, such as
Accounts Payable.
The Select a Report window (see Figure 14-1) appears with an alphabeti-
cal listing of available reports.
2. Click the report to view.

3. Click the Preview button.
Peachtree displays a dialog box that allows you to limit the information
that appears on the report. In most cases, the dialog box contains three
tabs: Filter, Fields, and Fonts. 
4. Click OK.
Peachtree displays the selected report on the screen. You can use the
scroll bars to view more of the report.
While previewing the report on-screen, click the Setup button to display the
Page Setup dialog box, where you can change the paper size, source, orienta-
tion, and printer selection.
In most screen reports, you can “drill down” to view the details of the transac-
tion. As you move the mouse pointer over the transaction, the pointer changes
to a magnifying glass that contains a Z (for zoom). Double-click, and Peachtree
displays the transaction in the window where you entered it. You can make
changes to the transaction and save it; in most cases, Peachtree automatically
updates the report to reflect the changes. If the report isn’t automatically up-
dated, click the report’s Options button and then click OK to refresh the report.

Printing Reports
After you’ve previewed your report on the screen, you may decide that you
want a paper copy or need to send the report to someone. 
Peachtree provides several ways to transmit a report. You can print it to
paper, send it by e-mail, or print it to a PDF file. You access these different
methods through the report toolbar, which is shown in Figure 14-2.
To print the report on paper, click the Print button. You see a dialog box
where you can select which printer you want to use, as well as which pages
to print and how many copies to print.
To print the report to a PDF file, click the PDF button. The Save As dialog box
appears. You can specify the PDF file name and location.
PDF stands for Portable Document Format. To view or print the report in PDF,
you must have the Adobe Reader software, which is a free download from the
Internet at www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html.

Chapter 14: Making Reports Work for You

To e-mail the report, click the E-mail button. A window from your default e-mail
program appears with the report as a PDF attachment (see Figure 14-3).
Peachtree fills in the e-mail subject and the message body with information
pertaining to the creation date and report title. Enter the recipient’s e-mail
address and then click Send. 
Finding the Facts
Some reports can be quite lengthy, and locating a specific number can look like
a total blur. While previewing a report, you can click the Find button to search
for specific text or numbers. When you click the Find button, Peachtree dis-
plays the Find on Report dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-4. 
You can make several search option selections:

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

 Find what: Use this box to enter the information you want to search.
 Search direction: Use this option to determine whether to search up or
down the report, depending on the location of the line with the thin blue
border around it.
 Match case: Use this checkbox if you want your search to be case-
sensitive. Peachtree will search only for text that matches the case of
whatever you enter in the Find what text box. For example, if you enter
SMITH in all capital letters and select Match case, Peachtree will search
for any occurrence of SMITH but will not search for smith or Smith.
 Use wildcards: Peachtree recognizes the ? and the * as wildcards, mean-
ing you can use them in the search to indicate unknown characters. The
question mark (?) represents a single character and the asterisk (*) can
represent any number of characters. Using the sample Aged Receivables
report, if you check the Use wildcards box and type a?m in the Find what
box, Peachtree could find armstrong, alma, palm, or any other similar com-
bination. If you type a*m, Peachtree would find all the words just listed,
along with Natasha Cannon, M.D. and Dash Business Systems, for example.
 Find complete words only: Use this box to tell Peachtree you want to be
specific and locate exactly what you type. For example, if you check this
box and type build in the Find what text box, Peachtree locates only the
word build, not builders or building. You can use this option along with
the Match case option.
If you use the Find box to search for text or numbers, even on a different report
or financial statement, Peachtree stores the last 20 values used during the
current Peachtree session. You can choose one of your previously entered
values by selecting it from the drop-down list. 
Enter the text or numbers you want to locate, check any desired options, and
then click Find Next. Peachtree locates and highlights the first occurrence of
the item. Click Find Next again to locate the next occurrence. Peachtree dis-
plays a message box when no more occurrences are found. Click OK and then
click Cancel.
Customizing Reports
Sometimes, the standard reports don’t contain enough information to meet
your needs. Or perhaps they contain more information than you’re looking
for. Maybe you want to see the information only for a particular customer or
vendor and over a different time frame than that specified in the report. You can
modify the date range, field information, font, and page layout of any report.
261
Chapter 14: Making Reports Work for You

Using filters
Filtering is the process of restricting the report data to a different set of speci-
fications than Peachtree shows in standard reports. Suppose that you take 
a standard report, for example, the Customer Ledgers, and view it a little 
differently.
In Figure 14-5, you see the Filter tab of the Customer Ledgers report. By default,
the standard Customer Ledgers report shows all activity for all customers for
the current month. But what if you want to see the transactions (both sales
and receipts) for the entire year for customer Cummings Construction? By
using filtering, you can have Peachtree display that information.
To use a filter, follow these steps:
1. Choose the report name you want to filter.
In the example, we chose the Customer Ledgers report under Accounts
Receivable.
2. Click Preview.
A dialog box appears in which you can set a variety of options for the
report you want to display. The first thing we want to change is the time
frame. By default, this report displays the current month, but we want to
see the transactions for the entire year.
If you double-click the report, the report displays on-screen with the
default options. Click the Options button to see the dialog box.

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

3. Click the drop-down arrow next to the Date box and change the date
to represent the period you want.
In our example, we want This Year. You can enter a more specific date
range by entering the beginning and ending dates in the From and To
boxes.
4. Click in the From box on the Customer ID filter line and type (or look
up and select) the first Customer ID you want to view.
In this example, we use CUMMINGS. Notice that when you select a spe-
cific ID, the Type column changes from All to Range.
If you want to see a list of IDs from a certain point down through the list,
enter only the From ID and leave the To ID blank. For example, if you want
to see every customer from SMITH through WILLIAMS, who is the last cus-
tomer on the list, enter SMITH in the From box and leave the To box empty.
5. Click in the To box on the Customer ID filter line and type (or look up
and select) the last Customer ID you want to view.
If you’re looking for one specific customer, enter the same ID in both the
From and To boxes.
Some reports allow you to select multiple IDs that are not contiguous.
Click the Type box next to the Customer ID, select Equal to, and then click
the From ID box. Hold down the Ctrl key and click the IDs you want to
view (see Figure 14-6).
6. Click OK to display the report on-screen.
Peachtree displays transactions for the specified time frame and the
specified customers. 
7. Click Close when you’ve finished reviewing the report.

Chapter 14: Making Reports Work for You

Adding, deleting, and moving report fields
Reports in Peachtree consist of data fields. Those data fields come from the
various modules in Peachtree. For example, information on an Aged Receiv-
ables report contains information from a variety of Customer and Sales fields,
and the payroll register displays information from a variety of Employee and
Payroll entry fields. You have the option of including or excluding any avail-
able fields to create a customized report.
For example, we want to add the current balance to the Chart of Accounts and
remove the Active/Inactive field. To customize a report, follow these steps:
1. Choose Reports➪General Ledger. 
2. Locate and double-click the report you want to modify.
In the example, we’ll modify the Chart of Accounts report. A standard
Chart of Accounts report displays four columns: the account ID, the
account description, an active or inactive status of the account, and 
the account type.
3. Click Options.
The options for the Chart of Accounts report appear.
If you want to modify a report that’s not currently displayed on-screen,
highlight the report in the Select a Report window and click the Preview
button. The options for the selected report then appear.
4. Click the Fields tab to determine the fields to display.
You can display any field in the dialog box on the selected report. 
You’ll find some fields appear dimmed, which indicates that they can’t
be changed. As you remove check marks from certain columns on the
Fields tab or change settings on the Filter tab, the dimmed (unavailable)
columns may become available. The fields currently being displayed
have a red check mark in the first column (the Show column).
5. Select the check box of the field you want to add.
For this example, check the Show box next to the Current Balance field
(see Figure 14-7).
6. Clear the Show check box of the field you want to remove.
In the example, we cleared the check box of the Active/Inactive field.
Removing the check mark removes the field so that it no longer appears
on the report. When you remove a field from a report, the columns pre-
viously displayed to the right of the removed field move to the left. In
this example, when we add the Current Balance column, it became the
fifth column, but when we removed the Active column, Current Balance
became the fourth column.
264
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

We want the Current Balance to appear next to the Account Description.
No problem! We just use the Move Up command to change its location.
7. Click the field name you want to move.
Use caution not to click the Show column, or you’ll turn off the display
of the field. When you select a field, a red border appears around the
entire selected line.
8. Click the Move Up or Move Down button to move the field up or down
one column at a time. Continue clicking the Move Up or Move Down
button until the field appears in the location you want.
Click the check box in the Column Break section to make the selected field
appear on a new column on the report. If you want to place more than
one field in a column, first make sure that you check the Show check box
and then remove the check from the Break check box. Doing so means
that Peachtree doesn’t place a break (a column) between the fields.
9. Click OK, and the report redisplays with the changes you selected.
Changing report’s column width
Adding too many columns may cause some to fall off the edge of a page. Well,
they don’t really fall off, but it does cause the report to print two or more pages
in width. You have several choices at this point. You can print the report in
landscape mode, print multiple pages in width, remove some report columns,
or stack some of the columns as described in the previous section or — and
this is probably the best choice — change the column widths. 
Figure 14-7:

265
Chapter 14: Making Reports Work for You

Use the following steps to change the column width: 
1. Preview the report on-screen and then click the Design button.
Short blue column marker lines appear to the right of each column, as
shown in Figure 14-8. If you see a long vertical dashed line, your report
prints multiple pages wide.
2. Drag the short blue column markers to the left to make a column nar-
rower or to the right to widen a column.
You’ll know the report fits on one page when the long blue dashed line
disappears.
Keeping in style
What’s your style — Classic, Elegant, Contemporary, or Professional? By default,
Peachtree uses the Professional style, which simply means that all reports print
in an Arial font. You can display any or all of your reports in any of the afore-
mentioned styles. Here’s a description of Peachtree’s furnished styles:
 Classic: The entire report uses a Times New Roman (black) font.
 Contemporary: The report heading appears as an Arial (red) font, the
data uses a Times New Roman (black) font, and the report totals appear
in Times New Roman (red) font.
Figure 14-8:
Drag the

266
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

 Elegant: The entire report uses a Garamond font. Headings and report
totals appear in navy blue, and the body data appears in black.
 Professional: The entire report appears in an Arial (black) font.
If you have a color printer, the reports print in the same colors that appear
on the screen.
Here’s an easy way to modify a report style:
1. Double-click the report you want to modify.
The report appears on-screen.
2. Click the Design button.
The report changes to Design mode and three icons appear on the left
side of the screen.
3. Click the Fonts button.
The options dialog box shown in Figure 14-9 appears.
4. Click the down arrow to the right of the Style box to display a list of
available styles.
5. Click the style you want for this report and then click OK.
The report redisplays on the screen with the new style.

Chapter 14: Making Reports Work for You

You can also create and save your own styles, choosing the font, color, and
sizes you prefer. However, we simply don’t have the room in this book to
show you how. 
Saving a customized report
Sometimes you customize reports for a one-time use, while other reports you
use frequently. To save yourself the trouble of recreating the customized
report each time you want to display it, save the report with a name that
you’ll recognize.
To save a customized report, follow these steps:
1. Display the customized report on the screen.
2. Click the Save button.
A Save As dialog box appears.
3. Enter a name for the report.
You can’t use the name of a Peachtree standard report. You must give 
it a unique name. For example, you might call a customized Chart of
Accounts report “My COA.”
4. Optionally, in the Description box, type a description of the report.
5. Click Save.
The report is saved for future use.
You can identify custom reports by the red flag Peachtree places on the
report icon.
6. Click Close to close the report window.
Delete any customized report by highlighting the report name and clicking
the Delete button.
Mail Merge
One common marketing tool is to offer existing customers a discount to
encourage them to purchase again. Make your customers feel really special
by sending them a personalized letter with this distinctive offer. What? You
don’t have time to send them a personalized letter? It takes only a few min-
utes to send such letters using Peachtree’s Mail Merge feature. 
268
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

You can use one of the standard letters included with Peachtree or create
your own letter. Combine the letter and the customer contact information
that you already have in Peachtree, and in a very short time you can have a
personalized letter for every customer in your database. Don’t want to send
this letter to everyone? That’s okay. You can choose which customers should
receive the letter.
This type of mailing is called a mail merge because you’re merging the generic
letter and the variable customer information. Peachtree includes a variety 
of mail merge letters for customer, vendors, or employees. The underlying
engine for this mail merge uses Microsoft Word. If you’re already familiar with
Microsoft Word’s Mail Merge feature, you can even customize your own letters
to merge with your Peachtree data.
For more details on using Word and Mail Merge, you might want to check out
Word 2003 For Dummies by Dan Gookin (published by Wiley).
You can create mail merge letters one at a time through the Maintain windows,
or you can create them in a batch from the Reports menu. We take a look at
both methods in the following sections.
You must have both Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word installed on your
system for the Peachtree mail merge process to work correctly.
Merging one record at a time
Perhaps you’re in the process of setting up a new employee and want to send
a letter welcoming him or her to your firm. As you enter the new employee
information in Peachtree, creating a welcome letter is just a click away. Follow
these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Employees. 
2. Enter and save the new employee’s information. 
Refer to Chapter 9 for setting up a new employee.
You can create letters for customers, vendors, or employees from their
Maintenance window.
3. With the employee information still on the screen, click the Letters
button.
The Mail Merge Template Selector window appears, as shown in 
Figure 14-10.
4. Click the letter template you want to use. 
In the case of the employee letters, there’s only one example, but you
can also create your own. 
269
Chapter 14: Making Reports Work for You

5. Click the Word button.
Microsoft Word opens with the completed letter ready for you to print
or further modify if desired. (See Figure 14-11.)
Optionally, click the E-mail button to e-mail the letter rather than open it
in Microsoft Word.

Merging multiple records 
When merging multiple records, you can select all or a specific group of cus-
tomers, vendors, or employees. The fields you can filter vary depending on
the type of data you are merging.
1. Choose Reports➪Mail Merge.
A list of available mail merge forms appears.
2. In the Report List, click the desired folder and then click the letter
you want to send.
3. Click the Letters button.
A filter dialog box opens where you can select the specific IDs, date
ranges, and other criteria.
4. Select the filter criteria you want to use.
Refer to the “Using Filters” section earlier in this chapter.
5. Click the Word button.
Microsoft Word opens with all the completed letters ready for you to
print or further modify if desired. 
Excel with Peachtree
If you have Microsoft Excel, you can send any report, including financial
statements, to an Excel workbook.
Why would you want to send a report to Microsoft Excel? Well, perhaps you’d
like to sort the report in a different manner than Peachtree offers, total a report
that Peachtree can’t total, or add a column based on a calculation. How about
creating a chart based on the data? We like to use the Excel function to copy
customer sales information that can be sorted and ranked in Excel. Those are
just a few things you can do by copying a report to Excel.
Follow these steps to copy report data to Excel:
1. Display the Peachtree report on your screen or highlight the report
name in the Select a Report window.
2. Click the Excel button to display the Copy Report to Excel dialog box.
3. Select the option you want to copy the report to Excel.
271
Chapter 14: Making Reports Work for You

You have two ways you can copy the report. You can choose Create a
New Microsoft Excel Workbook, or you can choose Add a New Worksheet
to an Existing Microsoft Workbook. The latter option appends the report
to an existing Excel file. Click the Browse button to select an existing file.
4. Click OK to copy the report to Excel.
Peachtree copies only values, not formulas, to Excel.
Occasionally Peachtree doesn’t recognize that you have Excel on your
system. If the Excel button isn’t available, but you know you have Excel on
your computer, right-click the report name (before you bring the report up
on the screen) and choose Excel. Doing so displays the report options dialog
box and then the Copy Report to Excel dialog box mentioned in Step 2.
For more details on using Excel, you might want to check out Excel 2003 For
Dummies by Greg Harvey (published by Wiley). 
Stay in a Group Now
If you have a number of reports that you need at the same time, you can
create a report group to print them all at once. Report groups print directly
to the printer or Microsoft Excel; they can’t be previewed on the screen.
In Chapter 17, we suggest reports that you should print at the end of the
month. Placing those reports in a report group makes the report printing
process much easier.
Follow these steps to create a report group:
1. From anywhere in the Select a Report window, click the Group
button.
The Report Groups window appears, as shown in Figure 14-12. All stan-
dard and custom reports appear in the Report Index list. To help you
find a particular report, you can limit the reports you see in the Report
Index list to only the reports for a particular module. Click the Report
Index drop-down arrow and select the module.
2. To build a report group, select the first report you want to include in
the group in the Report Index list and click the Add button.
Added reports appear on the right side of the window. Peachtree prints
the reports in the order they appear on the right side of the window.
272
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

3. Add any additional reports to the group.
You can mix and match report categories. For example, you may want to
print an Aged Payables report and an Aged Receivables report.
4. When you finish adding reports to the group, click the Save button.
The Save As dialog box appears.
5. Enter a name for the group, such as Monthly Reports.
6. Optionally, in the Description box, type a description of the reports.
7. Click Save to save the report group.
8. Click Close to close the Report Groups window.
When you’re ready to print the report group, click Report Groups in the Select
a Report window, and then click the name of the report group to print.
Click Print to print the reports to the printer with no further action on 
your part, or click the Excel button to send the reports to Microsoft Excel. 
If you send the reports to Excel, Peachtree opens each report in its own 
workbook.

B
efore you advance to the next Peachtree accounting period, you’ll prob-
ably want to print a series of reports for your records and possibly for
your accountant. Reports you may find useful include the general ledger, trial
balance, balance sheet, and income statement. Peachtree provides lots of
other reports you may want, but these are the most common ones. You’ll
probably want to include them in a report group. (See Chapter 14 to find out
how to create a report group.)
The preceding reports fall into two categories: general ledger reports and
financial statements. We begin by taking a look at the general ledger reports.
Reviewing Standard General
Ledger Reports
Two of the standard reports you’ll use frequently are General Ledger and
Trial Balance. Peachtree lists both of these reports in the General Ledger
report area of the Select a Report window. (You can find out how to display,
filter, and customize reports in Chapter 14.)
The General Ledger report is the mother of all accounting reports. This
report lists all transactions you enter into Peachtree that affect the general
ledger. Figure 15-1 shows a sample General Ledger report. Note the column
titled Jrnl. The reference in this column represents the source of the transac-
tion. Table 15-1 lists the different Jrnl codes and their source.

276
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

When printing or previewing the General Ledger report for multiple months,
you may find the option Hide Period Totals on Multi-Period Report useful.
You can select this check box on the Filter tab when you set up the report’s
options.
Like most Peachtree reports, you can double-click on a line to open the
window in which Peachtree created the original transaction.
Peachtree provides two trial balance reports. The first report, called General
Ledger Trial Balance, shows each account and its balance as of the last day of
the current period. The report displays the account ID and description as
well as the debit or credit balance.
The other trial balance report is Working Trial Balance. This report provides
a worksheet where you can list adjusting entries. Each account includes the
current balance and a series of lines where you can write down any neces-
sary adjusting amount. Referring to your handwritten trial balance entries
speeds up data entry when you need to make adjusting entries.
Using Segments and Masking
In Chapter 3, we show you how to set up your chart of accounts to better
track departments or locations. In that chapter, you see how important the
numbering sequence is when setting up the chart of accounts, especially if
you want to report on your different company areas, or segments.
In Peachtree Premium edition, you can formally divide your accounts into
segments. In other Peachtree editions, you set up your accounts in a pattern
where you could utilize report masking. Masking is the ability to limit infor-
mation in certain reports to a single division, department, location, or type
code.
You can use masking and segmenting in financial statements and in most gen-
eral ledger reports.
For a review of designing your chart of accounts for masking or segmenting,
see Chapter 3.
Report masks use a wildcard character, the asterisk (*), to represent all the
other digits of the account number except the digits you want on the report.
For example, Bellwether Garden Supply references two departments as
Aviary and Landscape Services; these departments are represented as AV
and LS in the chart of accounts. 40000-AV is the account number for the
277
Chapter 15: Reviewing the Financial Picture

Aviary sales account, and 40000-LS is the account number for the Landscape
Services sales account. So a mask for the Aviary department look like *****-
AV and a mask for the Landscape Services appears as *****-LS. On many
standard general ledger reports, you can use the mask when you set the
report options.
If you’re using Peachtree Premium edition, you can take advantage of the seg-
ments feature. Using segments over masking means you don’t have to remem-
ber the wildcard character or the number of digits. You need to remember
only what you called the segments, such as department or location.
From the Select a Report window, select the general ledger or financial state-
ment report you want to view. Click the Preview button to display the Options
dialog box.
If you’re using Peachtree Premium and have segments activated, you’ll see an
options box such as the one in Figure 15-2. You first select the segment type
you want to review. Then, in the From and To boxes, select the segments you
want.
If you’re not using Peachtree Premium, or if you do not have segments acti-
vated, you’ll see an options box for masking. You can create a mask such as
the one you see in Figure 15-3, which uses the asterisk wildcard.

Producing Financial Statements
You display or print financial statements through the Select a Report window
in the same manner as reports. Peachtree provides a number of predefined
financial statements, including a balance sheet and an income statement.
Similar to other reports, you can preview them, print them to a printer or a
PDF file, e-mail them, or send them to Excel.
Table 15-2 provides a list of all the Peachtree provided predefined standard
financial statements. If any of these statements don’t fit your needs, look in
the next section to find out how to customize them.

As we mention earlier in this chapter, the two most frequently used financial
statements are the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement. Here are a few
suggestions to assist you when working with your financial statements:
280
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

 All statements and reports appear for the current period unless you
select a different date range in the Options dialog box.
 Open any financial statement by double-clicking the desired report,
change the date range or other options, including segments, and then
click OK.
 Double-clicking an account displays the underlying details for the
selected account through the General Ledger report.
 If you’re using Peachtree Premium, you can access the monthly variance
statement also through the Maintain➪Budgets window.
 The option to select a segment does not appear if you do not have seg-
ments setup in General Ledger defaults.
Modifying Financial Statements
In this section, we take a look at Peachtree’s third designer — the Financial
Statement designer.
You can create customized financial reports using the Financial Statement
Wizard or by the conventional method of customizing a statement yourself
in the Financial Statement Design window. The Financial Statement Design
window gives you more individual control over each aspect of the financial
design process, but the Financial Statement Wizard provides a grasp of the
basic elements of a statement and how to put them together effectively.
Using the Financial Statement Wizard
The Financial Statement Wizard can assist you with great detail in creating a
financial statement. At every point in the process, the wizard makes your
choices clear so you know what effect each choice has on the finished state-
ment. The following steps show you how to use Peachtree’s Financial
Statement Wizard:
1. In the Select a Report window, choose Financial Statements.
2. Click the Financial Statement Wizard button.
The Financial Statement Wizard button is the big gray square (yep, that’s
a button!) in the lower-right corner. An introduction screen appears,
showing you the processes you can specify by using the wizard.
281
Chapter 15: Reviewing the Financial Picture

3. Click Next to see the Financial Statement Name screen.
Similar to customized forms and reports, customized financial statements
must have their own name. Additionally, you start customization by
basing your report on one that already exists, as shown in Figure 15-4.
This saves you tons of time!
4. In the drop-down list, choose an existing financial statement design to
use as the model for your new statement, and type a unique name for
the new statement.
Optionally, type a report description.
5. Click Next.
Each screen of the Financial Statement Wizard defines a specific area of
your financial statement:
• Headers and Footers: Enter the text of each header and footer you
want to include.
• Dates and General Ledger Account Masking: Choose the range of
dates you want the statement to cover. If you’ve set up your general
ledger accounts for department masking, you can enter an account
mask that limits reporting to just one of your departments. In the
next section, we show you how to create a departmental income
statement using the Financial Statement Design window.
• Column Properties: Select the type and properties of data that
appears in up to 30 columns.
• Column Options: For each type of column you set up in your state-
ment, you can determine secondary titles, the width, and the align-
ment for the column.

282
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

• Fonts: You can choose the fonts that Peachtree uses to display or
print each of the sections of your statement.
• Formatting and Default Printer: You can tell Peachtree which
printer you want to use, whether you want to print page numbers,
show zero dollar amounts, center the report on the page, and so
forth.
• Congratulations: Decide whether you want to display the newly
created statement, modify the new statement in the designer
window, or create another financial statement using the Financial
Statement Wizard.
6. Click Finish.
The designed financial statement appears for your review on your screen.
Creating customized financial statements
Earlier in this chapter, you can see that Peachtree Premium edition users
who also use account segments can enter the segment in the dialog box that
appears when they select a financial statement. But what about those of you
who aren’t using segments? Can you create a departmental financial state-
ment? Well, yes. In fact, you could use the Financial Statement Wizard to
create departmentalized statements. But you can also create your own
quickly and easily by using the standard statements provided with Peachtree.
Suppose that you want to compare the current period with the year-to-date
information for only one department. The standard income statement com-
pares current period information to year-to-date information for your entire
company. The upcoming steps outline how to create a departmental version
of the standard income statement, using the department mask.
Creating a new financial statement by using an existing financial statement as
a model is always easiest. To avoid accidentally damaging the model, make a
copy by saving it under a new name in the Design window. Then, modify the
properties of the column heading to include a department mask.
For a review on designing your chart of accounts for masking, see Chapter 3.
The following steps show you how to create a customized financial statement:
1. Choose Reports➪Financial Statements.
Peachtree displays the available financial statement report formats in
the Select a Report window.
283
Chapter 15: Reviewing the Financial Picture

2. Select the financial statement you want to modify and then click the
Design button.
In the example, we’re using the <Standard> Income Statement.
Peachtree’s Financial Statement Designer window for the Income
Statement appears (see Figure 15-5).
3. Click the button marked Column Desc and then click the Property
button.
The Column Description dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 15-6.

4. Click the row for Column 2 Activity to select it, and display the Dept.
Mask field.
Just like in the earlier section, “Using Segments and Masking in Reports,”
you create the mask by using the asterisk (*) wildcard character to rep-
resent all the other digits of the account number except the digits you
want displayed.
5. Add an appropriate mask.
To mask for just the Aviary department, for example, enter *****-AV.
6. Repeat the mask for other activity columns, such as Column 4 Y-T-D
Activity.
7. Click OK to redisplay the report design.
8. Click the Save button to display the Save As dialog box.
Peachtree will not allow you to overwrite a <Standard> financial state-
ment. You must supply a different name.
9. In the Name box, type a new name for the report.
For example, you might type Income Statement — Aviary.
10. Optionally, enter a Description.
11. Click OK.
Peachtree changes the report title in the title bar.
Now when you print or preview the report, it includes information only for
the department you specified.
Delete any customized financial statement by highlighting the financial state-
ment name and clicking the Delete button.
Copying Reports and Financial
Statements
You’ll find customized reports (in any report area) and financial statements
available only in the company you created them in. However, you can copy
reports and financial reports you create in one company to another company.
This feature comes in particularly handy if you create a second company and
would like to use a customized report or financial statement that you created
in the first company.
285
Chapter 15: Reviewing the Financial Picture

Peachtree makes customized forms (invoices, checks, purchase orders, and
so on) available in all companies, regardless of which company you used to
create them.
To copy reports or financial statements between companies, begin by opening
the company that does not have the necessary report. In the Select a Report
window, click the Copy button on the toolbar. In the Select a Company to Copy
from list box, select the company containing the report you want to copy.
Enter a name for the report and then click the Copy button. See Figure 15-7.

okay, so what?” you ask.
Well, if you’re smart, you’ll want to make sure that the bank thinks you have
the same amount of money you think you have. After all, banks make mistakes,
and you wouldn’t want to “give your money away” to the bank just because
you didn’t take the time to check their accounting and find their error. The
process of comparing the bank’s balance to yours is called reconciling.
Face it; accounting is not exactly a barrel of laughs. And reconciling your
bank statement probably wins the award for the least fun thing you can do
when working with your company’s books. However, reconciling is an impor-
tant function because it’s the only way to confirm that you and the bank
agree on the amount of money you have in your account.
Anyone who has ever tried to reconcile a bank account knows that the process
can be at best tedious, and at worst, a nightmare when you just can’t make the
bank’s numbers match yours. When you reconcile your bank statement using
paper and pencil, you add “time-consuming” to the list of negative adjectives.
So, let Peachtree help you. At least when you reconcile your bank statement
electronically, you finish more quickly. This chapter shows you how to use
Peachtree’s Account Reconciliation feature — and how to track down prob-
lems when things don’t balance on the first try.

Understanding the Concept of Balancing
Along with the checks in that envelope, you’ll find a statement that summa-
rizes the transactions the bank has processed for you during the month.
These transactions include checks you’ve written, deposits you’ve made, and
actions the bank has taken, such as charging your account for checks you
ordered or adding interest to your account.
You need to use the statement to compare the balance that the bank says
you have with the balance you think you have. In the best of all worlds, they
should match. If they don’t match, you need to figure out why they don’t
match and then take some action (which we talk about later in this chapter)
to make them match — that’s the part that most people think isn’t fun.
After you record the transactions the bank has entered (check order charges,
service charges, and the interest), the difference between your account bal-
ance and the bank statement’s balance should be the total of the uncleared
transactions. Uncleared transactions are any checks you’ve written or deposits
you’ve made since the cutoff date on the bank statement. You can think of
uncleared transactions as transactions about which the bank doesn’t know,
according to the information on the statement. To reconcile your account, you
add to the bank statement balance any deposits you’ve made since the bank
prepared the statement. Similarly, you subtract from the bank statement bal-
ance any checks you’ve written since the bank prepared the bank statement.
Typically, the bank’s cutoff date for a business checking account is the last
day of the month; this date coincides with the end of an accounting period
for most businesses. So, when you reconcile your bank statement, you effec-
tively determine your actual cash balance as of the last day of the accounting
period. Your accountant needs to know your cash balance on the last day of
the accounting period to prepare accurate financial statements, so reconcil-
ing your bank statement helps your accountant prepare financial statements.
When you reconcile using paper and pencil, you list and total all checks
you’ve written that don’t appear on the bank statement and all deposits
you’ve made that don’t appear on the bank statement so that you can sub-
tract and add them to the bank’s ending balance to determine whether you
and the bank agree on your account balance. Initially, the listing and totaling
is the most time-consuming part of the process (if your account doesn’t bal-
ance, finding the error can become the most time-consuming part of the
process). Peachtree shortens the listing and totaling part of the process by
doing the math for you.

Before You Start Reconciling
Before you start reconciling, you need to address two issues. First, when
you receive your statement from the bank, make sure you’re working in the
accounting period covered by the bank statement. Check the Peachtree
Toolbar (see Figure 16-1), which typically appears at the bottom of your
screen, to determine the current accounting period.
If you need to change the accounting period, follow these steps:
1. Click the box in the toolbar that displays the current period.
If you prefer, you can choose Tasks➪System➪Change Accounting
Period. The Change Accounting Period dialog box appears.
2. Click the period you want to reconcile.
3. Click OK.
Click No if you see a prompt asking if you want to print invoices or
reports.
For details on changing the accounting period, see Chapter 17.
Second, for deposits, some bank statements list individual items rather than
the deposit ticket total. Most banks, however, list deposit ticket totals rather
than individual items. If your bank lists individual items and you group receipts
using the deposit ticket ID field available in the Receipts, Receive Payments,
and Select for Deposit windows, you can print the Bank Deposit report, shown
in Figure 16-2, to match individual items to deposit ticket totals.
The period in which you are working appears here.
Figure 16-1:
Look at the
toolbar to
determine 
in which

you’re
working.
289
Chapter 16: When the Bank Statement Arrives

In the Account Reconciliation window, Peachtree lists individual items if you
don’t fill in the deposit ticket ID field or if you have items you have not yet
selected for deposit. If you fill in the deposit ticket ID field, Peachtree lists
the deposit ticket total rather than each individual item. The Bank Deposit
Report helps you tie back the individual items to a particular deposit so that
you can properly identify deposits that clear the bank. To print the report,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Reports➪Account Reconciliation.
The Select a Report window appears, showing the available account 
reconciliation reports.
2. On the right side of the window, select Bank Deposit Report.
3. Click the Print button.
4. In the Cash Account ID field, select the correct cash account.
5. Click OK.
The Bank Deposit Report doesn’t display deposits made through journal
entries.

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Starting Account Reconciliation
In the previous section, which we strongly suggest that you read, we discuss
two housekeeping tasks you should complete to prepare for reconciliation.
With those two housekeeping tasks out of the way, you’re ready to reconcile.
It won’t be painful. Honest. Or at least it won’t be as painful as it used to be.
To start the reconciliation process, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Account Reconciliation.
Peachtree displays the Account Reconciliation window.
2. Click the list box selector next to the Account to Reconcile box to dis-
play the list of your accounts.
3. Select the account you want to reconcile.
4. Click OK.
In Peachtree, you can balance any account, not just a checking account. For
example, you can balance savings accounts, petty cash accounts, and credit
card accounts.
After you select an account, Peachtree shows you all the transactions avail-
able for reconciliation for the period (see Figure 16-3). Any checks you
voided already have check marks in the Clear column. In the Checks and
Bank Debits section at the top of the window, checks you’ve written appear.
In the Deposits and Bank Credits section at the bottom of the window, the
deposits you’ve made appear.

291
Chapter 16: When the Bank Statement Arrives

The Account Reconciliation window also shows journal entries that affect the
account you are reconciling. So, in the strictest sense, you see more than
checks and deposits in this window. In the top of the window, you see trans-
actions that credited (oops, there’s that C word) the account, and in the
bottom of the window, you see transactions that debited (you knew that was
coming) the account.
You can maximize this window to see more information, and you can sort
the information in the window by any column in the window — just click the
column heading. And, if you’re looking for a particular transaction, you can click
the Find button on the Account Reconciliation window’s toolbar to search for it.

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 
Reconciling for the first time
If you’re reconciling for the first time in
Peachtree, you may find checks and deposits
on your bank statement that you haven’t
entered in Peachtree because the transactions
occurred before you started using Peachtree.
Your very first action after opening the Accounts
Reconciliation window should be to enter these
outstanding transactions. In the Account
Reconciliation window, click the Beginning
Transactions button in the lower-right corner of
the window. Peachtree displays the Beginning
Transactions dialog box shown in the figure.
Enter unreconciled transactions that appear on
your bank statement but occurred before you
started using Peachtree. In the top portion of the
window, enter unreconciled checks that were
written before you started using Peachtree.
Remember that “unreconciled checks” includes
checks remaining unreconciled from prior bank
statements as well as checks that appear on the
bank statement you’re about to reconcile. In the
lower portion of the window, enter unreconciled
deposits that were made before you started
using Peachtree. Like unreconciled checks,
“unreconciled deposits” includes deposits
remaining unreconciled from prior bank state-
ments as well as deposits that appear on the
bank statement that you’re about to reconcile.
For checks, assign the check number as the
Reference number. For deposits, the Reference
number doesn’t really matter; just make sure
that you enter the deposit amount as it appears
on your bank statement. Click OK when you
finish. The transactions you entered will appear
in the Account Reconciliation window so that
you can mark them as cleared and reconcile
your bank statement.

Marking Checks and Deposits
Okay, back to the bank statement. Stop looking at the Account Reconciliation
window for a minute and look at your bank statement. That’s it — that piece
of paper you got from the bank. Not the computer screen. (It’s so easy to get
glassy-eyed whiling reconciling a bank statement . . . we got glassy-eyed while
writing this chapter.) The bank statement shows checks and deposits that
have cleared the bank, along with those other miscellaneous transactions
that the bank may have recorded (service charges, interest, and so on). When
you compare it to the Account Reconciliation window (that’s right, you can
look back at the computer screen now), you’ll see some transactions in
Peachtree that don’t appear on the bank statement, and you may also see
some transactions on the bank statement that don’t appear in Peachtree.
You need to mark the cleared transactions that appear on the bank statement
as cleared in Peachtree’s Account Reconciliation window. Follow these steps
to continue the reconciliation process:
1. In the Statement Ending Balance box (at the bottom of the window),
enter the ending balance that appears on the bank statement.
2. In the Service charges box (below the Checks and Bank Debits por-
tion of the window), enter any bank service charges.
Assign the date of the bank statement to the service charges and select
the appropriate expense account for the service charges.
3. In the Interest Income box (below the Deposits and Bank Credits por-
tion of the window), enter any interest you earned.
Assign the date of the bank statement to the interest and select the
appropriate income account for the interest income.
4. Click in the Clear box at the left edge of a Checks and Bank Debits
entry if the entry appears on the bank statement.
Peachtree places a check mark in the box, indicating that the bank has
processed the item. You can match cleared checks on the bank state-
ment to checks in Peachtree using the number assigned to each transac-
tion. In the Account Reconciliation window, you’ll find the number for
checks in the Reference/Check Number column in the top half of the
window. Remember, you can sort the information in the window by any
column heading by clicking the column heading.
Instead of clicking one transaction at a time, you can mark groups of
transactions. If a consecutive range of checks — either by check number
or check date — cleared, you can click the Range button and enter the
range of numbers or transaction dates for Peachtree to mark. Or, as a
shortcut, if most of the transactions in either portion of the window
cleared the bank, click in that portion of the window, click the Row
button, and then click the All button. Peachtree marks all transactions
293
Chapter 16: When the Bank Statement Arrives

cleared. You can then remove check marks by clicking the Clear box
next to the transactions that did not clear the bank.
5. Click in the Clear box at the left edge of a Deposits and Bank Credits
entry if the entry appears on the bank statement.
Most people use amounts to match deposits on the bank statement to
deposits in Peachtree. If you’re having trouble matching deposits on
your bank statement to deposits in the Account Reconciliation window,
Peachtree probably grouped a deposit differently than the deposit you
presented at the bank. You can drill down on a deposit in the Account
Reconciliation window to open it in the Select for Deposit, Receipts, or
Receive Payment window (wherever it was created). Then if necessary,
change the deposit ticket ID number so that all items you deposited in
the bank on the same deposit ticket have the same deposit ticket ID
number in Peachtree. Also, use the bank deposit report we showed you
earlier in Figure 16-1 to help identify the receipts included in each
deposit in Peachtree.
You can use the same shortcut methods just described in the previous
tip to mark deposits cleared.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you have accounted for each transaction
that appears on the bank statement.
7. Check the Unreconciled Difference value — your goal is to make that
value equal to 0.
8. If the Unreconciled Difference value equals 0, you’ve reconciled and
you’re finished (pat yourself on the back); just click OK to save your
work.
9. If the Unreconciled Difference value doesn’t equal 0, read on (sorry).
When the Account Doesn’t Balance
What do you do when you’ve marked everything but the Unreconciled
Difference does not equal 0? Well, you do a little detective work. Go dig your
detective hat and magnifying glass out of the closet so you can prepare to
snoop around. We’ll wait. . . .
Items to review
The Unreconciled Difference may not equal 0 for several reasons:
 The bank may have recorded a transaction that you haven’t recorded
in Peachtree. Look for bank charges such as check reorder charges, other
service charges, or interest payments if your account is interest-bearing.
294
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

 The bank may have recorded a transaction for a different amount
than you recorded in Peachtree. Compare the amounts of checks
you’ve recorded in Peachtree to the amount the bank cleared for the
check. Similarly, compare deposit amounts you recorded in Peachtree
to deposit amounts on the bank statement.
Add the digits of the unreconciled difference and see whether they equal
9 or a multiple of 9. If so, the odds are good that you have transposed
the digits on one or more checks or deposits. We don’t know why this
works, but it does.
 You may have cleared a transaction that didn’t clear the bank. Review
the transactions you have cleared. If you used the Range button, double-
check the check numbers in the range both in Peachtree and on the
bank statement. Occasionally, you’ll write a check and forget to post it in
Peachtree, and the check will clear the bank. When you mark a range,
finding that transaction can be difficult.
 You may have recorded the Statement Ending Balance incorrectly.
Make sure you typed the amount correctly.
You can sort the information in the Account Reconciliation window by any
column in the window — just click the column heading. And, if you’re looking
for a particular transaction, you can click the Find button on the Account
Reconciliation window’s toolbar to search for it.
If you determine that you need to correct an existing transaction or enter a
check or receipt, you can leave the Account Reconciliation window open while
you edit or add the transaction in the appropriate window. Repeat: There is no
need to close the Account Reconciliation window. To edit a check or deposit,
double-click it in the Account Reconciliation window, and Peachtree opens it in
the window where you created it. To enter a check or deposit, just ignore the
Account Reconciliation window for a minute and choose Tasks ➪Payments to
open the Payments window, or choose Tasks ➪Receipts to open the Receipts
window. If you determine that you need to record either a bank service charge
or an interest payment, you can make an adjustment — read on.
Making adjustments
You make adjustments when you can’t find the problem and you decide to
write it off as a lost cause.
Accountants do not frown on adjusting to reconcile the account when the dif-
ference is small (less than $5). You need to weigh the trade-offs: Is it worth
spending hours to find a nickel? We have to believe that your time is worth
more if you’re doing something other than looking for a dime or a quarter. On
the other hand, don’t write off large unreconciled differences and don’t make
a practice of writing off unreconciled differences; eventually, they will come
back to haunt you.

295
Chapter 16: When the Bank Statement Arrives

To record an adjustment, follow these steps:
1. Click the Adjust button to open the General Journal Entry window.
Yep, that’s right, adjustments are journal entries. Don’t panic.
2. Record a journal entry.
On one line of the entry, select the cash account you’re reconciling for the
GL account. On the other line of the entry, select an income or expense
account for the GL Account. Record additional withdrawals for check
reorder charges as credits to the cash account and additional deposits
like interest earned as debits to the cash account.
Record the same amount on the other line that contains the income or
expense account. For additional withdrawals, select an expense account
like Bank Charges. For additional deposits, select an income account like
Interest Income. If you aren’t sure what account to select, ask your
accountant.
What about when you’re “off” by a small amount that you want to write
off? Remember this rule: If the Unreconciled Difference is negative, you
need to record a journal entry that credits the cash account for the
Unreconciled Difference amount. If the Unreconciled Difference is posi-
tive, you need to record a journal entry that debits the cash account for
the Unreconciled Difference amount.
3. When you finish, click Save and then click Close to redisplay the
Account Reconciliation window.
4. Place a check mark in the box next to each adjusting entry to mark
them as cleared and to balance your account.
Each debit or credit on the journal entry that affects the cash account
appears as a separate entry in the Account Reconciliation window.
5. When the Unreconciled Difference equals 0, you can consider the
account reconciled. Click OK to close the Account Reconciliation
window.
If you later find the source of the problem that caused you to make the
adjustment and you want to delete or change the adjustment, open the
General Journal Entry window and click the Open button. Double-click the
adjustment transaction to display it; then edit it or click the Delete button.
Printing the Reconciliation Summary
After all your hard work, you’ll want to print a record of the balanced recon-
ciliation. Follow these steps:
296
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

1. Choose Reports➪Account Reconciliation.
The Select a Report window appears, showing the available Account
Reconciliation reports.
2. From the list on the right, select Account Reconciliation.
3. Click the Print button to produce a paper copy of the report.
Peachtree prints a report similar to the one you see in Figure 16-4, show-
ing that the Unreconciled Difference is 0.
You may have noticed other available reports when you printed the Account
Reconciliation report. You don’t really need the Deposits in Transit, Outstand-
ing Checks, or Outstanding Other Items reports, because all of that information
appears on the Account Reconciliation report. We’ve already discussed the
Bank Deposit Report; the Account Register report lists individual deposits and
withdrawals in the selected account.
Figure 16-4:

Chapter 16: When the Bank Statement Arrives

In transit refers to checks you’ve written or deposits you’ve made that have
not yet cleared the bank.
By the way, you can see the same information that appears on the Account
Register report in the Account Register window. Choose Tasks➪Account
Register to display the window. (The window reminds us of the register you
use with a personal checking account to record deposits and withdrawals.)
For the current period, it lists only transactions that affect the cash account.
You can switch to a different cash account, and you can change the time-
frame displayed in the window. To see the details of any transaction, double-
click to drill down on it; Peachtree displays it in the window where you
created it.

Chapter 17
When Accounting Cycles End . . .
and Other Miscellaneous Stuff
In This Chapter
 Changing accounting periods
 Making general journal entries
 Preparing the payroll quarterly report
 Completing year-end tasks
A
lot of stuff happens at the end of an accounting period — whether that
period is a month, a quarter, or a year. Most of it deals with finishing the
transactions that belong in the period that’s ending. But you need to start
working in a new period before you finish working in the old period. Why?
Because you won’t have all the necessary information to finish working in a
period on the last day of the period. For example, you won’t be able to recon-
cile your bank statement on the last day of the period because the bank hasn’t
mailed it to you yet.
In this chapter, we talk about the things you do at the end of each period —
and some other topics that just don’t fit well in any other chapter, such as
(and here come those words!) making journal entries.
Changing Accounting Periods
When you open Peachtree, note the date that appears on the left side of the
toolbar, next to the current accounting period. The date matches the system
date on your computer, and Peachtree uses that date as the default date for
every transaction you enter.

This is true, except when the accounting period changes. Look at an easy
example: You use standard months in the calendar year for accounting peri-
ods, and your fiscal year matches the calendar year.
Fiscal year refers to the year your business uses. The fiscal year can be the
same as the calendar year — and run from January 1 to December 31. Or the
fiscal year might run from April 1 to March 31 or from July 1 to June 30. You
and your accountant establish your fiscal year with the IRS.
Your current accounting period is January. All through the month, Peachtree
will default transaction dates to the current day of the month in January. On
February 1, Peachtree will correctly report the date in the lower-left corner 
of the screen, but the default date for transactions will not be February 1 —
because you haven’t changed the accounting period. The default date on
transactions will be January 1 — and will remain January 1 for all subsequent
days — until you change the accounting period.
So, what’s the big deal? Well, you may be sitting around posting February trans-
actions in the accounting period that runs from January 1 through January 31.
That, of course, will misstate the financial condition of your business for both
January and February. You need to change the accounting period on the first
day of each new period.
“Is this a difficult thing?” you ask. Nope. “Don’t you need to wait to change
the accounting period until you’ve posted everything in the current period?”
Nope. You can switch back to any open period at any time. “You mean that
changing the accounting period doesn’t close it?” Yes, that’s what we mean.
In fact, in Peachtree, you can’t close a single accounting period; you can close
only a fiscal year, a subject we talk about later in this chapter. 
Although you can change to a prior accounting period, we don’t recommend
that you make changes to transactions in a prior period after giving your data
to your accountant. Such actions tend to strain relationships.
If you enable security in Peachtree Complete or Peachtree Premium, a padlock
symbol appears in the Change Accounting Periods dialog box next to prior
periods. You can allow users to view prior period transactions but prevent
them from editing those transactions using Peachtree’s security settings. In
the Maintain Users window, click the System tab. Then double-click the Tasks
program area and set the Transactions in Prior Periods option to Read. For
more information on Peachtree and security, see Chapter 18.
When you move forward to a new accounting period and operate on an accrual
basis, Peachtree asks you whether you want to print invoices, checks, and
reports before changing the period. (If you operate on a cash basis and have
printed all checks and invoices, Peachtree asks only about reports.) If you
haven’t finished entering transactions for the period, you don’t need to 
100 235
500
99
83
300
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

print anything. But we suggest that you simply answer no to these questions,
even if you’ve entered all transactions. Then when you’ve finished entering
everything for a period, use the Reports menu to print all the reports for the
period — the journals discussed at the end of the chapters in Part II and the
financial reports discussed in Chapter 15.
To make the report-printing process easier, create a report group that contains
all the reports you want to print at the end of a period. Then you won’t need
to select and set up each report. To find out how to make a report group, see
Chapter 14.
So, why do we suggest that you print reports using the Reports menu before
you change the accounting period? Well, the window you see when you’re
selecting reports to print while changing the accounting period doesn’t include
a few reports that you might find useful, such as the Balance Sheet, Income
Statement, Trial Balance reports. And although you can print these reports at
any time for any period, printing them for an accounting period while you’re
working in that accounting period is easiest.
Second, for reasons we don’t understand, when you print reports while chang-
ing the period, Peachtree displays reports from prior periods as well as reports
from the current period. You may think the reports appear because you’ve
changed a transaction in a prior period, but we can’t prove that. We’ve found
that printing reports using a report group is faster and easier.
Follow these steps to change the accounting period if you operate on an
accrual basis:
1. Click the Period button on the toolbar (the button that displays the
current period) or choose Tasks➪System➪Change Accounting Period.
The Change Accounting Period dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 17-1.
2. Click the new period you want to use, and then click OK.
Peachtree may display a dialog box asking whether you want to print
checks or invoices. 
3. If the dialog box appears, select Yes if you won’t be returning to this
period; choose No if you’ll be returning to this period to enter addi-
tional transactions.
If you select Yes, Peachtree simply redisplays the Change Accounting
Period dialog box with the original period selected. You’ll need to click
Cancel and print invoices or checks. If you select No, Peachtree displays
a dialog box asking whether you want to print reports.
Peachtree changes the accounting period; you’ll see the new period
reflected in the lower-right corner of the screen.
301
Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

If you operate on a cash basis and have no unprinted invoices or checks,
Peachtree doesn’t ask whether you want to print invoices and checks, but it
does ask whether you want to print reports. Again, we advise that you not
print reports at this time. Instead, create a report group to print the neces-
sary end-of-period reports.
Making General Journal Entries
Okay, don’t be freaked by the title of this section. Journal entries are nothing
more than another type of transaction to enter in Peachtree — you just won’t
use journal entries as often as you do other types of transactions. In fact, here’s
a good rule to follow:
Don’t enter journal entries unless your accountant tells you to make the
entry and you really know what you’re doing.
You see, the truth is, you can usually find another way to enter the information.
For example, when you pay your telephone bill of $37.50, you spend money
from your Cash account and identify what you spent the money on by making
an entry in your Telephone account. You don’t need to use the General Journal
Entry window; instead, you write a check from the Payments window or the
Select for Payment window.
Figure 17-1:
Use this
dialog box
to switch to
a different
period.
302
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

By the way, the example also demonstrates what accounting types mean when
they talk about double-entry bookkeeping. The term simply means that each
transaction conducted by your business causes you — and your accounting
software — to make at least two entries. And here come those dreaded words:
One entry is a debit and one entry is a credit. The most important thing to know
about debits and credits is that they must equal each other. Do you need to
know this? No. Peachtree will do most of it for you. Can it hurt you to know
this? No. Who knows . . . knowing may even help you.
So, when would you use the General Journal Entry window? Well, you’d use it
to record the depreciation of assets. Most businesses let their accountants
figure the amount of the depreciation — and then the accountant gives you the
journal entry information so you can enter the transaction. Or, if you use job
costing (see Chapter 12), you can add overhead to a job using a journal entry.
If you’re interested in the “how and why” of debits and credits, read the side-
bar titled “The accounting equation — and how it works.”
Okay, now that we’ve told you not to make journal entries unless you really
need to make them, we’ll show you how to make them:
1. Choose Tasks➪General Journal Entry to display the General Journal
Entry window (see Figure 17-2).
2. If necessary, change the date.
3. Enter a reference number to identify the transaction. 
We used JE (for Journal Entry) and then the month and date (refer to
Figure 17-2).

to record 
a journal
entry, it

4. In the Account No. column, select the first account you want to
change.
Accountants like you to list debits first and then credits. Doing so is not
a rule, but it will make you look more professional. We’re going to assume
that you want to look professional, so enter the debit first and then the
credit.
5. In the Description column, enter the reason for the transaction.
Peachtree copies these words to the next line for you, saving you the
typing. You can change them on the next line if you want.
6. In the Debit column, enter the amount.
7. If necessary, assign a job to the entry.
8. Repeat Steps 4–7, but in Step 6, enter the amount in the Credit
column.
When you finish, debits should equal credits. If they don’t, the amount
you’re out of balance appears at the bottom of the window.
9. Click Save to save the journal entry.
Peachtree won’t let you save the entry if it’s out of balance.
For some journal entries, you may need to enter multiple debits to offset one
credit or multiple credits to offset one debit. That’s fine. A journal entry con-
sists of a set of debits and credits that equal each other. Also, your accountant
may send you a list of entries to make before you close the fiscal year. You
can make all the entries in one General Journal Entry transaction — maybe
even with a description such as A “Adjustment per CPA.” That is, you can
keep entering lines in the General Journal Entry window using only one trans-
action number.
Accounting Behind the Scenes
If you chose the Hide General Ledger Accounts option for your company in
the Maintain Global Options dialog box, then your transaction windows don’t
look like the ones we show throughout this book. In particular, you don’t see
any general ledger accounts in your transaction windows. See Chapter 13 for
a comparison of what windows look like when you hide or display general
ledger accounts.
In Chapter 5, we promised to tell you about a neat way to identify the accounts
Peachtree updates as you enter transactions even if you don’t display the
general ledger accounts in your transaction window. Click the Journal button
in the window, and Peachtree displays the Accounting Behind the Screens
dialog box you see in Figure 17-3.

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

And yes, you can make changes in this dialog box to modify one or more of
the accounts Peachtree updates for this transaction, but we don’t recommend
it. Notice that you can’t change a debit to a credit or vice versa; if you change
the accounts and you don’t know what you’re doing, you’ll really mess up
your company’s books.
Batch Posting
People who like batch posting typically work in a multi-user environment and
want to review transactions before updating the general ledger. When you use
batch posting in Peachtree, you save transactions as you enter them, but they
don’t update your accounts — or appear on reports — until you post. You
choose batch or real-time posting in the Maintain Company window. See
Chapter 2 for more information.
Okay, so you know you need to post to update your accounts. You also need
to make sure you post all journals before you try to change the accounting
period. If you use batch posting, follow these steps to post:
1. Choose Tasks➪System➪Post to display the Post dialog box you see in
Figure 17-4.
2. Select the journal you want to post, or leave the check mark in All
Journals to post everything.
3. Click the OK button.
Peachtree displays a bar across the screen as it posts and then redisplays
the main Peachtree window when posting finishes.

Before producing many reports, Peachtree asks batch posting users if they
want to post before viewing the report.
Preparing the Payroll Quarterly 
Report (941)
This one’s easy. You’re gonna love it. To prepare the payroll quarterly report
(941), you just print a form. Actually, you need to print the form onto the IRS
form you receive in the mail. (See Chapter 14 for information on aligning
information on forms.) If you’re afraid you’re going to mess up the IRS form,
print Peachtree’s version to paper and transfer the numbers (be sure to put
everything in the right box).
We recommend that you print the 941 Worksheet (or the 941B Worksheet if
appropriate) before you print the Federal Form 941. The worksheet will show
you the amount you were supposed to deposit during the quarter — and we
assume that you make your payroll tax deposits in a timely fashion, as required
by law. You’ll need the amount you deposited to print an accurate Federal
Form 941. You can take advantage of the Print Preview feature and display the
941 Worksheet on-screen to see get the amount you should have deposited.
To print the appropriate forms, follow these steps.
1. Choose Reports➪Payroll to display a list of payroll reports.
2. From the Report List on the right, click the Federal Form 941 folder to
display the available versions of the 941 and 941B report.
3. Highlight the version you want to print, and then click the Print button.
Peachtree displays a dialog box showing the options for the form.
Figure 17-4:
Use this
dialog box
to post
journals.
306
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

4. Supply the total tax liability amount you paid for the current payroll
quarter.
5. Make sure that you’re printing the form for the correct quarter.
6. Click OK.
7. When Peachtree prompts you to select a printer, do so and then click
OK again.
Peachtree prints the form.
If you need to complete form 941B — the second page of the payroll tax liabil-
ity form — repeat these steps, choosing the correct form in Step 3.
If you don’t want to mess with form alignment and you don’t want to write in
the numbers, get fill-in forms from the IRS Web site. You can type your 941
information while displaying the fill-in form in Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.0 or
later, and then print the completed form. You can’t save the forms using
Acrobat Reader; if you want to save the forms, you must purchase Adobe
Acrobat Approval, available at the Adobe Web site (www.adobe.com) for a
nominal fee.
Printing W-2s
Printing W-2’s is similar to printing the 941 quarterly report. W-2s are forms
that you print, and you’ll need to purchase W-2 forms and load them into
your printer.
You can purchase your forms from your local office supply store or printer
(the people who print forms, not the machines), or you can use the offers
you receive in your Peachtree software box. Chapter 21 lists Web contact
information on a few sources for forms. (If you contact Deluxe Forms at
800-328-0304 and reference this book and discount code R03578, you’ll
receive 20 percent off your first order.)
By default, Peachtree automatically includes all employees that you’ve paid
during the current year when you print W-2s, even if you’ve marked an
employee as inactive.
You mark an employee inactive in the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps window
when the employee no longer works for you. But if the employee worked for
you during any part of a calendar year, you must provide the employee with a
W-2. Also, by marking the employee inactive, you make the employee a candi-
date for purging, which we talk about later in this chapter.
307
Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

You must print W-2s before you close the Payroll Tax year. If the federal gov-
ernment has changed the W-2 form, you’ll need to modify it (see Chapter 14).
Or you can subscribe to Peachtree’s Payroll Tax Table Service; toward the end
of December, the service will provide you with the latest update, including
any form modifications. (You find out more about updating payroll tax tables
later in this chapter.)
To print W-2s, follow these steps:
1. Choose Reports➪Payroll to display a list of payroll reports.
2. From the Report List on the right, click the Federal Form W-2 folder.
Peachtree displays available versions of the W-2 — 4 per page and
Standard. The form you select should match the form you purchased.
3. Highlight the form you want to print, and then click the Print button.
Peachtree displays the options dialog box for the form.
4. If necessary, make changes in the options dialog box.
You can (but shouldn’t need to) change the form to print, select employ-
ees by ID, or change the year for which you want to print W-2s (you can
select any open year).
5. Click OK.
6. When Peachtree prompts you to select a printer, do so and then 
click OK.
Peachtree prints the W-2s.
If you’re printing W-2s on laser forms, you need to print the forms several
times, one for each copy of the W-2 that should be produced.
Printing 1099s
I know it’s beginning to sound like a mantra, but 1099s are forms that you
print. You’ll need to purchase 1099 forms and load them into your printer.
You can purchase your forms from your local office supply store or printer
(the people, not the machines), or you can use the offers you receive in your
Peachtree software box. Chapter 21 lists Web contact information on a few
sources for forms. (If you contact Deluxe Forms at 800-328-0304 and reference
this book and discount code R03578, you’ll receive 20 percent off your first
order.)
308
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

By default, Peachtree automatically includes all vendors who meet both of
the following criteria:
 You’ve selected Independent Contractor or Interest in the 1099 Type
field of the Maintain Vendors window
 You’ve paid more than $600.00 or more than $10.00 in interest during the
calendar year
Refer to Chapter 5 for information on setting up vendors and the 1099 Type
field.
You must print 1099s before you close the payroll year. If the federal govern-
ment has changed the 1099 form, you’ll need to modify it (see Chapter 14). Or
you can subscribe to Peachtree’s payroll tax table service; toward the end of
December, the service will provide you with the latest update, including any
form modifications. (You find out more about updating payroll tax tables later
in this chapter.)
You use the same steps to print 1099s that you use to print W-2s, except that
the forms appear in the 1099 Forms folder under Accounts Payable in the
Report list.
Peachtree supports producing 1099s for only two types of vendors: Interest
(1099-INT) and Independent Contractors (1099-MISC). If you need to produce
1099s for more than two types of 1099 vendors, workarounds exist, but they
are beyond the scope of this book. So, once again, if you like this book, contact
Wiley and tell them that you want them to hire us to write a Peachtree Bible.
Updating Payroll Tax Tables
To calculate payroll accurately, Peachtree uses tax tables. Each tax table is
associated with the current year. The name of the table ends with the last
two digits of the current year, which means that as you begin a new calendar
year, you must have new tax tables with names that include the last two digits
of the new year. In addition, the calculations in the tax table may have changed,
and you need to make sure that the tax tables will calculate correctly. So, how
do you do this? We suggest that you subscribe to the Peachtree Payroll Tax
Table Update service. Whenever the government makes changes to payroll tax
tables or payroll forms, the service sends you a disk that you load to update
your tax tables. For more information on the service and subscribing, call
800-336-1420 or visit www.peachtree.com/html/tax_pca.cfm to order tax
tables online.
309
Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

Peachtree doesn’t come with global tax tables when you purchase the prod-
uct. Global tax tables include the tables that calculate federal income tax,
Social Security, and Medicare. To use payroll, you must have these tables. So,
either set them up yourself or pop for the Payroll Tax Table Update service.
You will need to manually update the User-Maintained tax tables. Since most
tax tables you see in the User-Maintained Payroll Tax Tables window don’t
change drastically from year to year, you can use last year’s tax table as a
model to create this year’s table. For details on creating a user-maintained
tax table, see “Union Dues” in Chapter 19.
Understanding Closing
Closing the Payroll Tax Year and the Fiscal Year are not difficult or time-
consuming. The activities you should complete before closing, however, can
be time-consuming. Before we jump into describing those activities, you
should understand what happens when you close in Peachtree.
Closing in Peachtree automatically does the equivalent of manually preparing
and posting closing entries to the general ledger. In addition, Peachtree resets
all your vendors’, customers’, and employees’ year-to-date totals to zero. That
way, you can begin monitoring the new year’s purchases with each vendor,
sales with each customer, and wages, benefits, deductions, and taxes with each
employee.
Why does Peachtree enable you to close the payroll tax year separately from
the fiscal year? The payroll tax year is based on a calendar year. When you
close the payroll tax year, Peachtree zeros out year-to-date wage and tax infor-
mation for employees and year-to-date purchasing information for vendors —
the information that appears on W-2s and 1099s.The fiscal year may or may
not be a calendar year. When you close the fiscal year, Peachtree zeros out
other information (such as year-to-date customer information) and closes
everything, including the general ledger. If your fiscal year is the same as
your calendar year, you still need to let Peachtree close both years to close
everything. 
Even if you don’t use payroll, you need to close the payroll year to zero-out
year-to-date vendor purchase information.
When you close, Peachtree automatically closes the first 12 periods, which
make up the oldest open year.
310
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Timing is everything when you talk about closing. Typically, no one is ready
to close a year on December 31. But because Peachtree allows you to have
two years — 24 periods — open simultaneously, you should have no trouble
moving forward to the new year while leaving the prior year open. Therefore,
closing should not become a pressing issue unless you find that you’re work-
ing in Period 24 and need to move to a new open period. If you find yourself
in this situation, you need to close both the Payroll Tax Year and the Fiscal
Year — and Peachtree will close Periods 1 through 12 and then renumber so
that the periods that used to be 13–24 become 1–12. 
To identify the years you have open, click the Change Accounting Period
button on the toolbar. The open Fiscal and Payroll Tax Years appear on the
right-side of the box (see Figure 17-5).
Payroll
Before you close the payroll year in Peachtree, you must finish payroll process-
ing for the year you intend to close. You should check employee background
information, wage information, and tax information. Printing W-2s should be
the last task you perform for the year you intend to close so that you can be
sure that the information on the forms will be accurate.
Figure 17-5:
The open
Fiscal and
Payroll 
Tax Years
appear in
the Change
Accounting
Period
dialog box.
311
Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

If you have adjustments or fringe benefits that should be reflected on W-2s,
you can include them in the last payroll of the year, or you can run a separate
payroll. We recommend that you try to include them in the last payroll of the
year. See Chapter 9 for information on setting up and paying bonuses.
Accounts payable
In addition to printing 1099s before closing the payroll year, the end of the year
is a good time to consider identifying any vendors with whom you no longer
do business and marking them inactive in the Maintain Vendors window. You
also should review open purchase orders and close any that you know you
won’t fill, making them candidates for purging along with inactive vendors.
Inventory
There are no special year-end procedures for inventory in Peachtree. However,
many businesses perform a physical inventory count at this time of year.
Peachtree’s Physical Inventory List report contains space for you to enter
actual counts, which makes taking physical inventory easier.
Be sure to print an Inventory Valuation Report after you adjust your quantities
to the physical count. See Chapter 11 for details on inventory and Chapter 14
for details on printing reports.
Accounts receivable
In accounts receivable, you simply need to clean up your files. You should
review customers and, in the Maintain Customers/Prospects window, mark
inactive those with whom you no longer do business. Review open quotes and
sales orders and close any that you know you won’t fill, making them candi-
dates for purging. You should also review your Aged Receivables report for
possible bad debts and write off any amounts that you know you won’t collect.
Job cost
Job cost helps you track costs and revenues over the life of a project. By its
very nature, job costing doesn’t run on a calendar or fiscal year basis and has
no end-of-year procedures. But while you’re housekeeping, you might want to
review existing jobs and mark appropriate ones as inactive using the Maintain
Jobs window.
312
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Account reconciliation
We recommend reconciling your December bank statements before you close
the fiscal year to make reconciled checks and deposits candidates for purging.
Unreconciled transactions remain in the system.
General ledger
You’ll probably want to wait to close the fiscal year until you’ve had time to
make year-end adjustments — and you get those from your accountant after
he or she has prepared the income tax return for the business. You also should
review your chart of accounts for accounts you’re no longer using and mark
those accounts inactive.
Even though Peachtree purges inactive transactions, the program retains
enough information to produce comparative financial statements.
Archiving your data
If you’re using Peachtree Premium, you can archive your company data at
any time, but the end of the year is a good time to create an archive copy of
your company data. When you archive data, Peachtree creates a read-only
copy of your company that you can use to print reports and review transac-
tions. From your accountant’s perspective, the good news is that you can’t
add, change, or delete anything in an archived company. Accountants really
don’t like it when you make changes to a closed period (it kind of makes 
them nuts) and, if you create an archive copy of your data to use for prior
year research right before you close, you will make your accountant very
happy.
Choose File➪Archive Company. In the Archive Company window, supply a
name for the company. Peachtree suggests the name Archive-XXXXXX, where
the Xs represent today’s date in six digit format. If you’re following our advice,
you’ll name your archive company file using the numeric form of the year that
you are archiving. Then, click Archive, and Peachtree creates the archive
company.
You many want to change the period to the last month (typically December)
of the year you are archiving before you create the archive file. If you change
periods as we suggest, Peachtree displays that month when you open the
archive file.
313
Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

To use an archived company, choose File➪Open Archived Company.
Peachtree displays the Open Archived Company dialog box, which lists all
archived companies you’ve created. Select the one you want to open and
click OK. Your company name along with the archive date appear in the title
bar of the window.
After you review reports or transactions, choose File➪Open Previous Company
to view a list of companies you can open. Select your company from the list.
Note that archive companies do not appear in this list.
Peachtree stores archived companies in a folder called Archives, which
appears inside your company folder after you create your first archive com-
pany. Should you happen to be housecleaning and get the urge, you can
delete old archives from the Archives folder.
Using the Year-End Wizard
We suggest that you print any year-end reports you want before you start 
the Year-End Wizard. When you close the payroll tax year, Peachtree doesn’t
prompt you to print any reports, and when you close the fiscal year, Peachtree
selects the reports for you that you can print. To retain some choice in this
matter, print all your reports before you start the Year-End Wizard.
It’s also important to understand that you can’t cancel the year-end closing
process once you click the Begin Close button in the Year-End Wizard.
Restoring from a backup becomes the only way you can “undo.” 
In addition to the backup that Peachtree will force you to make before closing,
we suggest that you use the archiving feature available in Peachtree Premium
and described in the “Archiving your data” section so that you’ll have access
to reporting and transaction details in closed years. If you’re using a version
of Peachtree other than Peachtree Premium, we suggest that you create a prior
year company as described in Chapter 19 so that you can print reports and
view transaction details in closed years.
Don’t forget that the closing process closes the first 12 periods. By the time
you close these periods, you won’t be working in them anymore; instead, you’ll
be working in Period 13 or later. It’s safe to close the first 12 periods if you’ve
finished all the work for those periods.
Closing the payroll year
Peachtree asks you to back up during the closing process, so make sure you
have disks available if you back up to floppy disks. 
314
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Even if your company’s fiscal year doesn’t match the calendar year, payroll
always operates on a calendar year basis. Therefore, sometime in January,
after you’ve created your last payroll for the preceding year, confirmed that
your payroll data is complete, and printed your W-2s, you’re ready to close
your payroll information for last year.
You won’t be able to cancel this process after the first screen.
Follow these steps to close the payroll year:
1. Choose Tasks➪System➪Year-End Wizard.
Peachtree displays the current open years; fiscal years appear on the
left side of the window and payroll tax years appear on the right.
2. Click Next to display the Close Options dialog box shown in Figure 17-6.
3. Select Payroll Tax Year and click Next.
Payroll Tax Year is not an option if the oldest open year is the 
current year. 
If you have any unprinted payroll checks or if you have not yet printed
W-2s or 1099s, Peachtree prompts you to print them before you continue.
Click Cancel, print the appropriate forms, and restart the closing process.
Once you close, you won’t be able to print them.
Peachtree displays the Back Up Company Data window. 
4. Click the Back Up button.
Peachtree displays the Back Up Company window, where you can

6. Click Next.
The Begin Close-Year Process window appears. This is your final chance

7. Click Begin Close.
Peachtree closes the oldest open payroll tax year and displays a window
where you see the new open years, both fiscal and payroll. 
8. Click Finish.
You can now continue to enter payroll information into the next year.
Closing the fiscal year
If you’ve finished processing and made all adjustments to a fiscal year, you
need to close that fiscal year in Peachtree. You’ll probably postpone closing a
fiscal year until well after you start a new one. For example, if your fiscal year
matches the calendar year, you probably won’t close last year any earlier
than March of the current year.
Before Peachtree will let you close a fiscal year, you must not have any pur-
chases that are “Waiting on a Bill” from the vendor in the year that you want
to close. Typically, you will have received all bills by the time you want to
close the fiscal year, but if you haven’t, you should change these transac-
tions. Choose Tasks➪Purchases/Receive Inventory. Then click the Open
button. For any purchase that contains a Y in the Waiting? column, remove
the check mark and post the transaction.
Depending on the amount of data in your company, closing can take awhile.
You can’t interrupt the process. 
Before you start the Year-End Wizard, make sure you print any year-end
reports you want.

Chapter 17: When Accounting Cycles End . . . and Other Miscellaneous Stuff

Purging
You can purge information from your company data files at any time, but most
people like to tie purging with other year-end activities. Peachtree lets you
purge transactions in closed years of your company, and you can purge payroll
and 1099 transactions only when you’ve closed both the fiscal and payroll tax
years during which you entered those transactions.
Purging can take quite a long time, depending on the size of your data, the
speed of your computer, and the age of the transactions you choose to include
in the purge. Peachtree’s purge process doesn’t have a limit to the number of
passes it makes, or the time it takes to go through the journal file. We strongly
recommend that you start this process before leaving for the night or weekend.
If your Peachtree journal file is large, you may want to purge every month. To
determine the size of your journal file, choose Help➪Customer Support and
Service➪File Statistics and look at the Size in Kbytes column for the Jrnl Rows
file. If this file is larger than 50 MB, you’ll probably want to purge in small
increments.
Peachtree purges two types of data:
 Transactions: Quotes, invoices, sales orders, receipts, purchases, pur-
chase orders, payments, paychecks, and general journal entries from
previous years that are no longer needed. If you use Peachtree Premium
or Peachtree Complete, Peachtree also purges time and expense tickets.
 Inactives: Customers, vendors, employees, inventory items, jobs (and
phases and cost codes if you use Peachtree Premium or Peachtree
Complete), and general ledger accounts that you’ve marked as Inactive
in the Maintain windows.
If you plan to purge inactives, you should also purge transactions because
Peachtree won’t purge inactives if any transactions apply to them.
Follow these steps to purge information:
1. Choose Tasks➪System➪Purge Wizard.
Peachtree displays a screen that tells you the earliest date you can use
to purge data.

You can stop a purge as long as the Stop button is available in the Purge
Is in Progress window. When that button appears dimmed, you can’t
safely interrupt the purge. Yes, that means turning off your computer at
this point is not recommended.
11. When the purge finishes, click Close.
You can click the Log button to see a file in the Windows Notepad listing
your selection criteria and information about what did and did not purge
(see Figure 17-8).

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

When Stuff Doesn’t Purge 
Sometimes, after purging, you’ll find information still in the system that you
think should have been purged. Peachtree follows some extensive rules when
selecting information to purge. 
We don’t have room to list all the rules Peachtree follows, but we do list the
ones that we believe affect the majority of transactions that don’t purge.
Anything Peachtree leaves in your database we call a saved transaction, and
we refer to the date you specify while setting up a purge (the one that identi-
fies the latest transaction date Peachtree will purge) as the purge through
date. Peachtree saves the following:
 All transactions dated later than the purge through date.
 All transactions in any open year.
 Purchases and invoices that are not completely paid as of the purge
through date.
 All cash disbursements or receipts applied to a saved purchase or invoice.
 All purchases and invoices that are related to saved cash disbursements
or cash receipts.
 Purchases or invoices related to unpurged jobs.
 Open sales orders and purchase orders.
 All quotes with a transaction date or good-through date later than the
purge through date.
 Unreconciled transactions (as of the purge through date) associated
with an account you designate as one you reconcile.
 For Peachtree Premium and Peachtree Complete, time or expense tickets
dated later than the purge through date or available as reimbursable
expense tickets. If you have not chosen to purge unused time tickets,
Peachtree also saves unused tickets for employees paid using time tick-
ets and tickets tied to customers where the ticket status is HOLD.
 Inactive jobs (and phases and cost codes for users of Peachtree Premium
and Peachtree Complete) with saved transactions that refer to the inac-
tive job.
Use the purge log to review what Peachtree purged and what it didn’t purge.
The log will even tell you why an item wasn’t purged. Peachtree stores the
purge log (purge.txt) in your company data folder. You can open it at any time
by locating it using Windows Explorer and double-clicking it.

 Backing up and restoring data
 Password-protecting your data
 Using the audit trail
A
s with any financial software, a business has a lot at stake with Peachtree
data. After all, it holds the financial picture of the business. In this chap-
ter, we show you how to protect that data. You discover how to protect your
data from computer failure as well as from unauthorized entry. We even show
you how to play detective and snoop on what others are doing to your financial
data. We don’t provide the detective hat, overcoat, and spyglass. Those you
need to provide for yourself.
Backing Up Your Data
You know the silly (but popular) little saying, “Stuff Happens.” (That’s not
exactly how it goes, but you get the idea.) Well, it’s true. Things happen. Now,
we don’t mean to sound pessimistic here, but computers do fail, data gets
deleted or corrupted, and disasters like fire or theft can occur.
Well, you can always get another computer and reload Peachtree, but even for
millions of dollars you can’t buy all the work that you’ve put into Peachtree.
That’s why backing up your company data files on a regular basis is important.
You can then restore your data if necessary.
By backing up company data within Peachtree Accounting, your company
data files and customized forms are backed up by using the Peachtree format.
You can save your Peachtree backup to a floppy disk, a hard drive, or other
mediums, such as Flash or Zip drives, tapes, or recordable CDs.

If you choose to back up your company data to a tape device, you must exit
Peachtree and use the tape backup to copy the company files. To make back-
ups to those mediums, refer to the tape instruction manual. However, we really
don’t recommend this method.
Establish a regular policy for backing up your data. Backups are the only way
to guarantee the safety of the accounting records that you create in Peachtree.
Without backups, you run the risk of losing weeks, months, or even years of
work. Do you really want to take that kind of risk?
The general rule is that if you used Peachtree that day, back it up that day.
Backing up data doesn’t take long, and in case of a catastrophe, you’ll be glad
you did. Disks are inexpensive, even Zip disks, especially when compared to
the costs of reconstructing and reentering data.
In Table 18-1, we show you an ideal plan for backing up. That’s the one that
we really suggest that you use. However, we’re also realistic. We show you an
absolute minimum strategy for backing up in Table 18-2. If you don’t follow Plan
A (the ideal), at the very least, follow Plan B (the minimum). Believe us — you
won’t regret it. Backing up is the cheapest form of insurance that you can have.
When we refer to backup disks, they can be floppy disks, Zip disks, Flash
drives, recordable CDs, or tapes.
Table 18-1
Plan A: An Ideal Backup Strategy
Number of Disks
Backup Plan
Ten sets of daily disks
Back up onto a set of different disk(s) each day
(Monday through Friday) for two weeks, and then
begin again with the same set of disks.
Twelve sets of monthly disks
At the end of each month, back up to one of these
sets of disks. Keep the monthly disk sets off site.
Table 18-2
Plan B: The Minimum Backup Strategy
Number of Disks
Backup Plan
Five sets of daily disks
Use one set of disks for each day of the week and then
start reusing them again the following Monday.
Two sets of monthly disks
At the end of each month, back up to one of these sets
of disks. Again, alternate them. For example, use one
disk in January, and then use the second disk in
February. Reuse the January disk in March. Keep the
monthly disk sets off site.
324
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Label each disk with the day of the week. If a backup uses more than one
disk, be sure to number the disks so that you know which disk is Disk 1 of 
the backup.
To back up your Peachtree data and customized forms, use the following 
procedure:
1. Choose File➪Back Up or press Ctrl+B to display the Back Up Company
dialog box.
No other users can work in Peachtree during the backup process.
Select the Reminder check box if you want Peachtree to prompt you to
back up in a specified number of days. When the specified number of
days has elapsed, Peachtree displays a reminder message as you close
the company or exit the program.
In a moment, Peachtree suggests a name for the backup file, but first,
Peachtree wants to know whether it should include the company name
as part of the backup filename. We recommend that you do include it,
especially if you have multiple companies. That way, you won’t confuse
the backups of one company with another. If you do want to include the
company name as part of the backup, select the Include company name
in the backup file name check box.
Peachtree can also backup your archived data if any is available. Find
out more about archiving data in Chapter 17.
2. Click the Back Up button to display the Save Backup As dialog box.
3. In the File Name text box, type a filename for the backup set or leave
the one Peachtree suggests.
Peachtree backup files use the *.ptb (for Peachtree backup — clever,
huh?) file extension. Peachtree automatically adds the current date to the
backup file name. If you elected not to include the company name as part
of the backup filename, Peachtree includes the letters BU as part of the
filename. (In case you’re wondering, BU stands for backup — also clever.)
4. From the Save In list box, choose a location for the backup set.
We recommend backing up to a floppy disk (through the A: drive), a
Flash drive or CD drive, a Zip disk, or a different computer.
For data protection, don’t back up the Peachtree data to the same hard
drive where the current data resides. If the hard drive crashes, you’ll have
two sets of unrecoverable data, and that won’t do you one bit of good.
5. Click the Save button.
Peachtree displays the estimated size in megabytes (MB) of your
backup, or if you’re backing up to a floppy disk, Peachtree displays the
estimated number of floppy disks needed for the backup.
325
Chapter 18: Keeping Your House Safe

6. Click OK.
If you’re backing up to floppy disks, Peachtree prompts you to insert the
first and subsequent disks as needed.
7. Click OK.
The system displays the backup progress.
Depending on the quantity of data, the speed of your computer, and the
backup device that you use (floppy drives back up more slowly than any other
kind of device), the backup process might take several minutes to complete.
Don’t interrupt the process. Interrupting the backup process could corrupt
the data — and then you’d have a useless backup.
If you’re backing up to floppy disks, you probably need to erase those disks
before you use them again. Refer to your Windows documentation for proce-
dures on erasing floppy disks.
If you’re backing up to a Zip disk, rewriteable CD or a Flash drive, at some
point the disk might become too full to hold another backup, so you’ll want
to erase the oldest backup file. Refer to your Windows documentation for
directions on deleting files.
If you have a server making automated backups for you, be sure that you don’t
make incremental backups. You cannot backup individual files, because each
file relates to another. You must backup the entire Peachtree company data. In
fact, we suggest that you let the server back up everything and that you back
up Peachtree independently by using the steps that we provide — it’s safer,
and we’re into safety, especially when it’s Peachtree data we’re talking about.
Restoring Information
We sincerely hope that you never ever have to restore your data. If you do, it
probably means that something really bad happened, and we just don’t want
those kinds of incidents to materialize.
But if something does happen . . . you’ll be so glad that you read this chapter
and found out how to back up and restore your data.
If you backed up company data by using an alternate utility (for example, a
tape program), you must use that program to restore your company data.
No other users can use Peachtree during the restore process. Use the follow-
ing steps to restore your data:
1. Open the company that you want to restore.
326
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Any data that you entered after making the backup isn’t part of the
backup and so is lost.
2. Choose File➪Restore to launch the Restore Wizard.
Peachtree displays the Select Backup File window, as shown in Figure 18-1.
If the file that you want to restore doesn’t appear, click the Browse
button and then locate and click the name of the backup file that you
want to restore. Peachtree backup files use the *.ptb file extension.
Many compression programs, such as WinZip, can open and extract PTB
files.
3. Click Next.
The Select Company screen appears. You can restore the backup file
over the currently open company data, or you can restore it to a new
separate company folder.
4. Select the option that you want, and then click Next.
What data gets restored? Peachtree works differently from some of the
accounting programs that you might have used. When you restore data,
you’re restoring all the information that was previously backed up; all the
Receivable, Payroll, Payable, Inventory, and Job Cost information together.
Everything. The process replaces all the current data files with those
that have been previously backed up. You cannot restore individual files
because each file relates to another. However, you can restore your cus-
tomized forms, such as invoices or checks, separately from your data.
5. Click the options that you want restored, and then click Next.
A confirmation screen appears.
6. Click Finish.
Peachtree displays the progress of the restoring data files. If you restore
data from floppy disks, Peachtree prompts you to insert any subsequent
disks as needed.
Figure 18-1:

ally displays

327
Chapter 18: Keeping Your House Safe

Depending on the quantity of data, the speed of your computer, and the
backup device that you use, the restoration process could take several min-
utes to complete. Don’t interrupt the process. Interrupting the restoration
process could corrupt the data.
Securing Your Data from Prying Eyes
Because accounting data is highly sensitive and confidential, you might want to
prevent unauthorized persons from accessing your data. Peachtree includes a
security system that allows you to set accessibility parameters for each user
that you identify. Peachtree security makes use of user IDs and passwords.
Setting up users
Peachtree can allow tailored access for different individuals. With the secu-
rity feature activated, Peachtree requires each user to enter his or her ID and
password before opening and working with company data. With the correct
user ID and password, users can access the areas of the program to which
they have rights.
If you choose to set up users, you must set up at least one user with access
to the Maintain Users window. Typically, this user is considered a system
administrator who has the access rights to all Peachtree features, including
setting up and maintaining company users and their passwords.
While setting up users, no other users can be using Peachtree.
To set up users, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Users.
With the first user ID created, Peachtree displays an information box.
2. Click OK to close the information box.
3. In the Maintain Users dialog box, enter a unique ID for the first user.
Set up the system administrator first.
Typically, you use the first name or initials, or in the case of the adminis-
trator, try something like admin for the user ID.
4. Enter a password for the user.
This is the user’s secret code to access Peachtree. The password can be
up to 13 alphanumeric characters. Don’t use a slash (/) as part of the
password.
328
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Passwords and user IDs are both case sensitive and must be unique: Joe,
joe, and JOE are all different. Two users can’t have the same password.
5. Click Save.
With the first user ID created, a message box appears.
6. Click OK to close the message box.
Don’t lose the password! If you do lose your user ID or password, and no
one else can open the Peachtree company, you have no back-door way
to access the passwords. You’ll need to back up your data and send it
into Peachtree Technical Support for them to locate the information.
This process can take several weeks!
7. To enter additional users, click the New button.
8. Enter the next user ID and its corresponding password.
From here, you can customize the rights for each user (see the following
section) or click the Close button to close the Maintain User dialog box.
Customizing user rights
When setting up users, you can select an access level to each program area
for an individual user. For example, if you have a clerk who mainly makes
Accounts Receivable entries, you might want to restrict that clerk from
accessing Accounts Payable, Payroll, or General Ledger information. Perhaps
you have a person who receives inventory, but you want to restrict him or
her from editing the information after it’s entered or from printing Inventory
Valuation reports.
By customizing the user rights, you give each user specific access. The rights
vary depending on the feature. Through the Maintain Users window, you can
choose from the following options when deciding how much access you want
to allow a user:
 No Access at All to the Feature
 Only the Ability to View the Data
 To View and Add to the Data
 To View, Add to, or Edit the Data
 Full Rights, which allows the user to view, add, edit, or erase data.
The security that we describe here is for the Complete and Premium editions.
If you’re using Peachtree Accounting, your choices are limited to setting secu-
rity selections for an entire module (Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable,
Payroll, and so on).
329
Chapter 18: Keeping Your House Safe

With the exclusion of the system administrator (the first user that you set up),
by default, Peachtree provides each user full access to all areas of Peachtree
except access to Maintain Users.
We recommend that you have only one administrative user with access to the
Maintain Users window. This setup prevents multiple users from accessing
other users’ passwords, changing other users’ records, or inadvertently eras-
ing users.
To quickly restrict access to a primary program area, such as Payroll, select a
control level in the Summary tab of the Maintain Users dialog box. For exam-
ple, in Figure 18-2, we restrict all rights to Payroll by clicking the Summary tab
and selecting No Access from the Control drop-down list.
Follow these instructions to be more specific in user accessibility:
1. Click the tab for which you want to set restrictions.
Peachtree displays a list of the program areas.
2. To expand the list of program areas in the grid, double-click the triangle
to the left of the program area and then click the Control area you
want to modify.
The access choices vary depending on the feature. For example, if you
click the Sales tab and open the Control drop-down list for Receipts, you
find that you can select Full, No Access, Read, Add, or Edit. But if you
open the Control drop-down list for Master Lists under the Reports pro-
gram area, you can select only Full or No Access. In Figure 18-3, the user
named Alex can enter or view Inventory transactions but cannot edit or
erase them.
Figure 18-2:

named Bob

3. Click Save.
Any changes that you make take effect the next time you open the 
company.
Removing users
When users leave or change positions, you can stop them from accessing
Peachtree data. You have the option of deleting users or making them inac-
tive. When you make users inactive, their user ID profiles remain in Peachtree,
but you disable their access to the company. Deleting users erases their user
IDs and passwords.
To remove a user, choose Maintain➪Users to display the Maintain Users
window. Enter or look up the user record that you want to remove, and then
select the Inactive check box or click OK to delete the user.
If multiple users still exist, and you attempt to delete the only administrative
user with access to Maintain Users, Peachtree displays an error message. You
cannot remove the administrator user until you have removed all other user
records.
Any changes that you make take effect the next time you open the company.
Logging on as a user
After user IDs exist, when you or anyone on your Peachtree network (if you’re
on a network, that is) tries to open your Peachtree company files, Peachtree
prompts you for a user ID and password.
Figure 18-3:
Each user
can have
specific
access to
individual
areas of
Peachtree.
331
Chapter 18: Keeping Your House Safe

Enter your user ID in the User ID text box, and then enter your password in
the Password text box. Press Enter.
User IDs and passwords are case sensitive.
The user ID system works like this: Say you give user Bob no access to
Payroll, but user Alex does have Payroll access. No matter whose computer
Bob uses — his own computer or Alex’s computer — he doesn’t have access
to Payroll when he logs on as Bob.
To prevent unauthorized access to your data, exit the Peachtree program
when you leave your computer unattended.
Using the Audit Trail Report 
to Track Actions
Peachtree includes an audit trail security feature that tracks when a person
enters new data, maintains (edits) existing data, and removes data. The audit
trail provides accountability of users, discourages users against fraudulent
activity or mistakes, and tracks transaction history. The Audit Trail report
traces all activity and adjustments; from this report, you might find that trans-
actions were completed without your knowledge.
Only the Peachtree Complete or Premium editions contain the audit trail 
feature.
Turning on the audit trail
Before you can begin using the Audit Trail report, you need to tell Peachtree
to begin tracing your steps:
Choose Maintain➪Company Information to open the Maintain Company
Information dialog box. Then select the Use Audit Trail check box and click OK.
If you haven’t set up users with password protection, a message appears, sug-
gesting that you do so to personalize audit trail activity. We recommend that
you set up users as we describe earlier in this chapter in the aptly named sec-
tion, “Setting up users.” Peachtree can associate the user currently working
in the Peachtree company with the data being entered or maintained, conse-
quently providing a more comprehensive audit trail.
332
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

If you activated the audit trail feature and implemented password security,
limit access to the Maintain Company Information window to one or two
users. This action can prevent other users from inadvertently removing audit
trail functionality to enter or maintain company data in a fraudulent manner.
Viewing the Audit Trail report
The Audit Trail report displays the date and time a Peachtree action took
place as well as who did it and what he or she did.
To view the Audit Trail report, choose Reports➪Company to display the Select
a Report dialog box, and then double-click the Audit Trail report to display
the report on-screen.
Like other Peachtree reports, you can customize the Audit Trail report. See
Chapter 14 for instructions on customizing reports.
By default, this report displays only the transactions that took place on the
current date, but you can click the Options button to select a different time
frame. You can even specify the user ID that you want to review.

T
his book wouldn’t be complete if we didn’t provide you with solutions for
some common situations. Given the limited space we have in the book to
present Peachtree to you, we worked really hard to make room for these “real-
life situations.”
Handling Customer Prepayments
Under certain conditions, your customers may pay you before you actually
deliver the goods or services you promise. For example, in the building 
business, customers often provide down payments that builders use to pur-
chase construction materials. Some service providers, such as lawyers and
CPAs, request retainers before performing work. If your customers pay you 
in advance, you’re accepting money that is a liability to your business, and
you must account for it as a liability until you deliver the promised goods or
services.
Deposits and prepayments — interchangeable terms — are, by definition, 
payments received before you deliver goods or services. Your method of
accounting — cash or accrual basis — has no bearing on how you handle
these prepayments. Prepayments from customers are actually your liabilities.
100 235
500
99
83

Because you receive the money before you supply the goods or services, you
now have an obligation (a liability) to the customer to complete the transac-
tion. Deposits are unearned revenue.
First, you need a G/L account in which to record customer prepayments when
you receive them. To handle customer deposits, from the Maintain Chart of
Accounts window, set up Customer Deposits as an Other Current Liability type
account. (See Chapter 3 to review adding accounts.)
Second, set up a nonstock inventory item for deposits. Use the Customer
Deposits G/L account you created for all three G/L accounts (Sales, Salary/
Wages, and Cost of Sales), and be sure to select an exempt Item Tax Type. See
Chapter 11 to review setting up inventory items. When you receive a prepay-
ment from your customer, create a receipt to track the deposit by following
these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Receipts to display the Receipts window.
2. Enter the deposit ticket ID, customer ID, reference number, date, pay-
ment method, and cash account as you normally enter receipts.
Refer to Chapter 8 for details on entering receipts.
3. On the Apply to Revenues tab, enter a quantity of 1.
4. In the Item drop-down list, select Deposits.
5. Enter the amount of the deposit.
6. Click Post to save the transaction.
This transaction debits Cash and credits Customer Deposits. The balance
sheet shows the Customer Deposits account and the Cash account increased
by the amount of the prepayment.
After you perform the work, you want to send your customer an invoice. Add
a final line item on the invoice showing a quantity of –1 using the Deposits
item for the amount of the prepayment (see Figure 19-1). If the amount of the
invoice you create equals the amount of the prepayment, the customer owes
you nothing. If the invoice amount exceeds the prepayment amount, the cus-
tomer owes you the difference between the invoice amount and the prepay-
ment amount.
On the line showing the deposit, be sure to enter a negative number (–1) for
the quantity but use a positive number for the unit price amount. Peachtree
automatically converts the total amount to a negative number. When you
receive the balance due from the customer, create another receipt. The amount
that appears in the Receipts window is the remainder of the invoice amount.

Creating a Prior Year Company
When you close and purge a fiscal year, the transactions and reports are no
longer accessible. Before you close your year, you should archive your com-
pany data if you’re using Peachtree Premium. If you’re using any other edition
of Peachtree, you should create a prior year company so that you can print
reports, look for transactions, and so on. The big picture? You create a backup
of your existing company, create a new, empty company, and then restore the
backup into the new, empty company.
To find out how to close and purge a fiscal year, turn to Chapter 17.
Follow these steps before you close the fiscal year.
1. Open your company in Peachtree.
2. Choose File➪Back Up and then click Back Up.
3. In the File Name text box, leave your company name but replace
today’s date with the last open fiscal year (so that you can easily 
identify the data in the backup).
Figure 19-1:

4. Under Save In, select the folder on your C drive where you store your
Peachtree company data.
If you work in a network, save the backup to the My Documents folder
on your C drive.
5. Click Save to back up.
When the backup is complete, you need to restore it and simultaneously
create a new company.
The following technique works with Peachtree 2004 or later. If you have an
older version of Peachtree, you need to create a new, empty company before
you restore, and then restore the backup into that company.
To restore the backup, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Restore to start the Restore Wizard.
2. On the Select Backup File screen, click Browse and navigate to the
location where you stored the backup.
3. Select the backup file (its name ends with .ptb) and click Open.
4. Click Next to display the Select Company screen.
5. Click the A New Company option button and click Next.
6. On the Restore Options screen, check all appropriate boxes.
Peachtree automatically checks Company Data; if you have Customized
Forms or Web Transactions, check those boxes as well.
7. Click Next.
8. On the Confirmation screen that appears, click Finish.
Peachtree creates a new company for you and restores the backup
into it.
9. When Peachtree finishes the process, choose Maintain➪Company
Information and change the name of the new company.
Use an obvious name, such as FYXXXX Company Data, where XXXX is
the last open fiscal year in the company. This step makes the second
copy of your company appear as a separate name in the Open Company
window.
You can now open your regular current company by choosing File➪Open
Company. When you need to refer to the prior-year company, you can find it
in the Open dialog box.
338
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Handling Retainage
Suppose that you receive partial payment at the beginning of a job and the
balance when the job is completed. If you work this way, you have retainage,
and you need to know how to correctly bill customers and track both billed
and unbilled amounts owed to you.
You need only one extra account on your balance sheet — an Other Current
Asset account called Retainage Receivable. See Chapter 3 to review adding
accounts.
Suppose that the terms of your contract specify that you will earn $10,000
and get paid 90 percent at the beginning of the job, with 10 percent, or $1,000,
held as retainage. You need to prepare an invoice for $9,000 and account for
the $1,000 retained by the customer:
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales/Invoicing to display the Sales/Invoicing window
and select the customer for whom you need to prepare the invoice.
2. In the line item section of the invoice, create two lines.
3. Fill in the total sale amount ($10,000 in our example) and post the line
against an income account.
4. On the second line, post the retainage amount as a negative number
to the Retainage Receivable account.
This transaction credits an income account for $10,000, recognizing the
revenue you will generate from the contract. It also debits Accounts
Receivable for $9,000, the amount the customer owes immediately, and
Retainage Receivable for $1,000, the amount the customer will pay when
the job is completed.
When the customer pays you for the original invoice — $9,000 in this exam-
ple — record the receipt in the same way that you’d record any receipt in the
Receipts window. When you finish the job, you need to bill the customer for
the final amount — the retainage amount of $1,000 in this example. Record an
invoice, posting the line item for the retainage amount as a positive number
against the Retainage Receivable account. As a result of this invoice, Peachtree
debits the Accounts Receivable account and credits the Retainage Receivable
account, reducing the amount of retainage the customer owes but increasing
the customer’s regular Accounts Receivable balance.
To use the following method to track retainage balances, we suggest that you
use an invoice number for the retainage bill that is the same as the original
invoice number, followed by an R.
339
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

When the customer pays this bill, record the receipt the same way you would
record any receipt in the Receipts window.
To help you identify clients who have unbilled retainage amounts, we suggest
that you take advantage of Peachtree’s Account Reconciliation feature, which
allows you to reconcile any account, not just bank accounts. Follow these
steps to reconcile an account:
1. Choose Tasks➪Account Reconciliation to display the Account Recon-
ciliation window.
2. Select the Retainage Receivable account.
Note that some amounts appear in both the top and the bottom portions
of the window. For example, the Vendor/Payee at the top and the Descrip-
tion at the bottom are the same. The entry at the bottom of the window
occurred when you prepared the original invoice that held back the
retainage amount. The entry in the top portion of the window occurred
when you billed the retainage.
3. When you see a pair of like entries in the top and bottom portions of
the window, check them off as we’ve done in Figure 19-2, because they
represent billed retainage amounts.
You don’t need to enter the Statement Ending Balance, because you
don’t have a statement; the Unreconciled Difference should always be
zero, because you’re checking off matching entries in both the top and
bottom of the window.
4. When you finish marking off matched pairs, click OK.

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Use the Account Reconciliation Other Outstanding Items report to identify the
clients and retainage amounts you didn’t mark off in Account Reconciliation.
These are the amounts that you have not yet billed. Choose Reports➪Account
Reconciliation and highlight the Other Outstanding Items report. On the Filter
tab, choose the Retainage Receivable account. When you print the report,
you’ll see only retainage amounts that you haven’t yet billed.
Paying for Purchase Orders 
by Credit Card
Here’s the situation: You ordered goods using a purchase order and, at the
time that you placed the order, you hadn’t made a decision about how you
wanted to pay for the goods. The goods arrive, and you now decide that you
want to pay for them using a credit card. You need to make sure that you
account for everything properly in Peachtree.
We assume that you have a Credit Card Payable account — an Other Current
Liability account — on your chart of accounts so that you can record credit
card purchases in Peachtree. If you don’t have a Credit Card Payable account —
yours might be called Visa Payable or American Express Payable — set one
up using the Maintain Chart of Accounts window.
The process starts when you decide to buy a product and you issue a purchase
order. You create the purchase order the same way that you create any pur-
chase order. Some time passes, and the goods you ordered arrive. You need
to receive the goods into inventory and establish that you owe the vendor
money. Enter a purchase against the purchase order in the same way that you
enter a purchase against any purchase order.
So far, you haven’t done anything unusual. But when you pay for the goods
using a credit card, you need to make some changes from your usual proce-
dures. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Payments to display the Payments window.
2. Select the vendor.
3. Find the appropriate purchase to pay and click in the Pay column.
4. Change the Cash Account from your checking account to the Credit
Card Payable account (see Figure 19-3).
5. Enter a dummy check number and click Save to save the transaction.
341
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

When the credit card bill arrives, you need to make sure that you post the
items on it correctly in the Purchases/Receive Inventory window. Typically,
you post each line item to its appropriate expense account. But for goods
you ordered on a purchase order and paid for using a credit card, you need
to assign the purchase order charge on the credit card bill to the Credit Card
Payable account (see Figure 19-4).
When you’re ready to pay the credit card bill, use the Payments window or
the Select for Payment window. Make sure that you use your regular cash
account when you print the check to pay this bill.
For those of you who care, we’ll explain the debits and credits posted to 
the general ledger with these transactions. If you don’t care, you can quit
reading here.
Entering the purchase order had no effect on the general ledger; no purchase
order affects the general ledger. When we entered the purchase to receive the
goods into inventory and post a payable for the vendor, we debited expense
(or inventory) accounts and credited Accounts Payable.
When we paid the vendor’s bill, we debited Accounts Payable (reducing 
our debt to the vendor and washing out the Accounts Payable account) 
and credited the Credit Card Payable account (increasing the credit card 
liability).
When we recorded the line on the bill from the credit card company for the
goods purchased using the purchase order, we debited the Credit Card Payable
account (washing out the Credit Card Payable account) and credited Accounts
Payable (increasing our debt to the credit card vendor).

Last, when we paid the credit card bill, we debited Accounts Payable (reduc-
ing Accounts Payable and washing out the balance owed to the credit card
vendor for the credit card bill), and we credited Cash (reducing the balance
in our checking account).
For you visual people, Table 19-1 summarizes the debits and credits.

Real-Life Payroll Situations
There are dozens of real-life payroll situations, so we picked the ones we
figure occur most frequently and therefore would be of the most use to you.
In the pages that follow, we show you how to set up some common payroll
deductions and taxes.
Payroll deductions, in general
For all payroll deductions, you need at least two elements: the payroll field for
the deduction and a general ledger account that you tie to the field. Because
you assign a general ledger account to a payroll deduction, we usually suggest
that you first set up the general ledger account and then set up the deduction.
In many cases, you also need a third element: a payroll tax table to calculate
the amount of the deduction. And you assign a payroll tax table to a deduc-
tion. So, when a deduction requires a payroll tax table, we suggest that you
first set up the general ledger account, then set up the payroll tax table, and
finally set up the deduction.
“But what does a payroll tax table have to do with a deduction?” you ask. Well,
Peachtree uses payroll tax tables to calculate more than just federal, state, 
or local taxes due. The name “payroll tax table” is somewhat of a misnomer,
because these tax tables store calculations that you need for payroll — even
if the calculation is not for a tax. You can set up payroll tax tables to calculate
401(k) deductions, health insurance deductions, union dues deductions —
you can see where we’re going with this concept.
Remember one important fact when you create a payroll tax table for your
own use: Create the tax table in the User-Maintained Payroll Tax Tables
window. Why? To protect your payroll setup. You see, when you subscribe to
Peachtree’s payroll tax table update service, Peachtree will replace the tax
tables you see in the Peachtree-Maintained Payroll Tax Tables window. But it
won’t touch the tax tables you see in the User-Maintained Payroll Tax Tables
window. If you store your calculations in the Peachtree-Maintained Payroll
Tax Tables window, your calculations will be wiped out when you update 
payroll tax tables at the end of the calendar year.
Finally, you also need to define the elements of Adjusted Gross Income so
that Peachtree can calculate payroll deductions or additions. You find out
how to define the elements of Adjusted Gross Income later in this chapter in
Health Insurance and Union Dues.
344
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Employee loans
Suppose that you loan money to an employee. You can set up a payroll
deduction so that the employee can repay the loan from his or her paycheck.
And, depending on the repayment amounts, you can either manually enter
the repayment amount on each paycheck or Peachtree can automatically
deduct a fixed amount from each paycheck until the loan is repaid.
The general ledger
You need at least two elements for a payroll deduction: the general ledger
account and the deduction. For the employee loan, you don’t need the third
element — the payroll tax table.
To track a loan, set up another current asset account on your Chart of
Accounts, and call the account, say Employee Loans or Employee Advances.
If you intend to loan money to more than one employee, we suggest that you
use Peachtree’s masking feature (if you’re using Peachtree Premium, use the
segmenting feature) and set up individual accounts for each loan that would
roll up into the Employee Advances account. For example, if you created
14100 for your Employee Advances account, the account number for a loan to
Dorothy Beckstrom might be 14100-01, and the account number for a loan to
Elliot Adams might be 14100-02. See Chapters 3 and 15 for information on
masking.
Writing a loan check
When you write the check for the employee’s loan, use the Payments window.
You don’t need to set up the employee as a vendor; simply type the employee’s
name in the Pay to The Order Of box. On the Apply to Expenses tab of the
Payments window, fill in the employee’s loan account as the G/L account.
The payroll field
You need to use the manual repayment method if the repayment amounts
differ from paycheck to paycheck.
Set up a payroll deduction for the loan by following these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the EmployEE Fields tab.
3. In the Field Name column, add a field called Loan (see Figure 19-5).
The name must not contain spaces. The name you use will appear on the
paycheck stub.
345
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

4. In the G/L Account list, select the main account you set up for employee
loans.
In our example, we selected 14100.
5. Place a check mark in the Run column.
Peachtree will now maintain a running total for the deduction even when
you close the payroll year.
6. Click OK.
Next, use these steps to assign the loan payroll field to the employee to
whom you are making the loan:
1. Choose Maintain➪Employees/Sales Reps.
2. Select the employee to whom you are making the loan.
3. On the EmployEE Fields tab, remove the check mark from the STD
column (see Figure 19-6).
Figure 19-6:
Make
changes for
employees
who don’t
use the
standard
defaults.
Figure 19-5:
Setting up a

346
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

4. Change the G/L account to the account for the employee.
5. Click Save.
Repaying the loan
When you create a paycheck for the employee, fill in the repayment amount
on the paycheck as a negative number. To track the amount the employee
has repaid, customize the Yearly Earnings report; using the Fields tab, show
only the payroll field for the loan and the Amount field. On the Filter tab,
check the Show Totals Only check box.
If you can divide the loan amount into equal installment payments, then you
can let Peachtree automatically record the loan payment on the employee’s
paycheck. Set up the general ledger account and the deduction as we describe.
However, when you edit the employee’s record in the Maintain Employees/Sales
Reps window, also fill in the loan repayment amount as a negative number in
the Amount column on the EmployEE Fields tab.
Garnishments
Occasionally, you need to hold back money from an employee’s check as a
legal garnishment. Garnishments are another form of payroll deduction similar
to employee advances; however, garnishments typically use all three elements
of the payroll deduction. For the general ledger account, use an other current
liability account in the case of a garnishment instead of the other current asset
account you set up for an employee loan. You also need to set up the payroll
deduction, and you’ll probably use a payroll tax table to calculate the garnish-
ment amount. Later in this chapter, in Health Insurance and Union Dues, you
see some examples of setting up payroll tax tables.
Different states have different requirements for garnishments; the garnish-
ment might be a percentage of adjusted gross pay or a percentage of net pay.
Check with your accountant to determine the correct way to calculate the
garnishment.
Health insurance
For health insurance deductions, you need two elements: the general ledger
account and the payroll deduction. But health insurance deductions come in
two basic types: after-tax deductions (non-qualified plans) and before-tax
deductions (qualified plans such as cafeteria plans). And for cafeteria plans,
you need to take an extra step and include the field when Peachtree calculates
the adjusted gross amount it uses for taxes.
347
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

As the employer, you must pay the amount you deduct for health insurance
to the insurance company that supplies the plan. Therefore, the amount is a
liability to you, and you need to set up an other current liability account in
your Chart of Accounts.
You set up the health insurance deduction in the same way that you set up the
deduction for an employee loan. On the EmployEE Fields tab of the Employee
Defaults dialog box, type a name (no spaces allowed) for the health insurance
deduction. Remember that the name you type will appear on the paycheck
stub. Supply the liability account for health insurance.
You handle this next part in the same way you handle employee loans, as we
describe in the preceding section. If you deduct the same amount for most
employees, enter the amount in the Amount column on the EmployEE Fields
tab of the Employee Defaults dialog box as a negative number. To supply
amounts for employees who don’t pay the standard amount or who don’t pay
anything, open the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps window and select the
employee. Click the EmployEE Fields tab and remove the check mark from the
STD column for the health insurance deduction. Then supply the appropriate
amount as a negative number in the Amount column (refer to Figure 19-6).
A new payroll field can affect the calculation of existing payroll fields.
Whenever you add a tax-sheltered deduction or an addition that is taxable,
you need to click the Adjust button for other payroll fields that are affected by
the new field. For example, suppose that an addition field — perhaps an auto-
mobile benefit — is subject to Social Security and Medicare. You need to click
the Adjust buttons for Social Security and Medicare and select the Use box for
the new addition field (the automobile benefit in our example) to make sure
that Peachtree includes the addition field when calculating adjusted gross
wages for Social Security and Medicare.
Tax-sheltered deductions — such as a health insurance deduction for a cafe-
teria plan — are typically deducted from Gross Pay before calculating taxes. So
you need to click the Adjust button next to Federal Income Tax, Social Security,
Medicare, and any state and local taxes. In the Calculate Adjusted Gross dialog
box, shown in Figure 19-7, you select the Use box next to the health insurance
deduction. Then Peachtree will subtract the health insurance deduction from
gross pay before calculating taxes. If you’re not sure whether a deduction is
taxable, check with the plan administrator.
You’ll find ADJUSTED_GROSS in the formulas of many payroll tax tables.
When you use one of these payroll tax tables, you need to identify the fields
that Peachtree should include when calculating ADJUSTED_GROSS to make
Peachtree actually calculate something. You identify these fields by clicking the
Adjust button next to the new field you’re adding and then selecting the Use
348
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

box next to the fields that Peachtree should add or subtract when calculating
ADJUSTED_GROSS. As a rule, whenever you create a payroll field for which you
don’t supply an amount in the Amount column, you should always click the
Adjust button for the new field and select the Use box for the Gross field. The
Gross field is the first field in the left column — you can’t see it in Figure 19-7. A
formula that includes ADJUSTED_GROSS in its calculation makes Peachtree cal-
culate something; if the formula doesn’t include ADJUSTED_GROSS, you won’t
hurt anything.
Union dues
Deducting union dues from an employee’s paycheck can be tricky simply
because so many different ways exist to calculate union dues. In this section,
we examine how to set up payroll to calculate and deduct union dues, and
examine four different ways of calculating the amount:
 Deducting a flat amount per month
 Deducting a number of hours of pay per month
 Using an hourly rate based on hours worked
 Using a percentage of gross pay
To calculate union dues, you need all three elements of the payroll deduction:
the general ledger account, the payroll field, and the payroll tax table to cal-
culate the union dues amount.

349
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

As an employer, you handle union dues deductions in the same way you
handle federal income tax deductions — you collect the money due from 
the employee and turn it over to the proper authority. So, to track the union
dues collected that must be paid to the union, you need an other current 
liability account on your Chart of Accounts. See Chapter 3 for help creating
the account.
Setting up a payroll tax table
For most union dues calculations, we think you’ll find it easiest to use payroll
tax tables to calculate the amount to deduct from an employee’s paycheck.
Follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Payroll Tax Tables➪User-Maintained to display the User-
Maintained Payroll Tax Tables window (see Figure 19-8).
2. Type an ID for the tax table.
Use a name such as Union XX, where XX represents the last two digits of
the current year.
3. Type a name, adding to the end of the name a space and the last two
digits of the year for which the tax table will be applicable.
4. Even though the Government box has nothing to do with union dues
(no jokes please), select State or Local in the Government box.
5. Enter the appropriate formula for the calculation you want Peachtree
to make (see the next section).
6. Click the Save button to save the tax table.

Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Figuring out what goes in the Formula box
The information in the Formula box will change, depending on how you 
need to calculate union dues. And many of the formulas we show you use
EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER or EMP_SPECIAL2_NUMBER. These two fields represent
variables that you set for individual employees. To set the values for these
variables, open the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps window, select the
employee, and click the Withholding Info tab. As needed, supply values in the
rows for Special 1 and Special 2.
If you’re supplying a percentage, make sure you type the percentage as a per-
centage. For example, if the percentage is 2.65%, type 2.65; don’t type .0265,
which is the rate, not the percentage.
If the formula you use requires different rates for each employee, the formula
will reference EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER or EMP_SPECIAL2_NUMBER, and you’ll
need to enter each employee’s rate in the employee’s record. However, if the
formula calls for the same rate for each employee, you should substitute that
rate in the formula as a value instead of using EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER or
EMP_SPECIAL2_NUMBER.
To calculate union dues as a percentage of adjusted gross pay, use the follow-
ing formula for both salaried and hourly employees:
ANSWER = -ADJUSTED_GROSS*EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER/100
If you need to calculate union dues based on a number of hours worked, use
the following formula for hourly employees, where REGULAR, OVERTIME, and
SPECIAL are the pay levels you set up in your company:
ANSWER = –(REGULAR+OVERTIME+SPECIAL)*EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER
If you pay your employees a salary instead of an hourly wage and need to 
calculate union dues based on a number of hours worked, use the following
formula, where pay periods are biweekly and consist of 80 hours. If you pay
some employees weekly, some biweekly, and some semimonthly, you’ll need
separate tax tables, one for each pay frequency. In the weekly tax table, change
80 to 40; in the semimonthly table, change 80 to 88.
ANSWER = -80*EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER/100
If all employees pay the same percentage, you can substitute that percentage
for EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER/100 in the formula.
Suppose that you must deduct an amount equal to two hours of pay per month
for an hourly employee. In the following formula, you enter the annualized
amount you need to deduct in the Special 1 field on the Withholding Info tab
351
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

in the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps window. Peachtree then prorates the
annualized amount so that the correct amount is deducted from an employee’s
paycheck based on the frequency you pay. For example, if an employee earns
$10 per hour, union dues would be $20 for the month or $240 for the year —
and that’s the number you enter in the Special 1 field. If you pay your employ-
ees weekly, you’d want to deduct $4.62 per paycheck. Using the PRORATE func-
tion tells Peachtree to divide the annualized amount ($240 in our example) by
the number of pay periods in the year (52 in our example) to determine the
amount to deduct per pay period.
ANSWER = -PRORATE(EMP_SPECIAL1_NUMBER)
If you must deduct a flat amount — say 5 cents per hour — based on the
number of hours worked, use the following formula:
ANSWER = -(REGULAR+OVERTIME+SPECIAL) * .05
REGULAR, OVERTIME, and SPECIAL are the pay levels you set up in your 
company.
If you must deduct a flat amount per month, regardless of the number of
hours the employee works, you don’t need to set up a payroll tax table.
Instead, calculate the total amount due for the year and divide that number
by the number of pay periods in the year. When you set up the deduction for
each employee, supply that number.
Creating the payroll deduction 
for union dues
You create the payroll deduction for union dues on the EmployEE Fields tab
of the Employee Defaults dialog box, using the same steps that you used to
create the deduction for health insurance. Remember that the name you type
appears on paycheck stubs and cannot contain spaces. Supply the liability
account for union dues and, if you created a payroll tax table to calculate
union dues, place a check mark in the Calc column. The Tax Name column
will then become available, and you can select the payroll tax table that you
created. Last, be sure to click the Adjust button and select the elements of
pay that Peachtree should include in ADJUSTED_GROSS when calculating
union dues. At a minimum, select the Use box next to Gross.
If you didn’t create a payroll tax table to calculate the union dues deduction,
supply the liability account for union dues when you create the field, but
don’t place a check mark in the Calc column. If most employees pay the same
amount for union dues, type that amount as a negative number in the Amount
column, remembering to supply the amount per pay period. Peachtree will
352
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

assign the amount you type in the Maintain Employee Defaults dialog box to
all employees. For an employee who don’t pay the standard amount, select
the employee in the Maintain Employees/Sales Rep window and click the
EmployEE Fields tab. Then remove the check mark from the STD column, 
and type the amount per pay period that you want to deduct as a negative
number in the Amount column.
Showing employer contributions 
on paycheck stubs
Suppose that you want to display the employer’s contribution on the
employee’s paycheck stub. No problem. In fact, although we use union dues
as the example, you can display any employer contribution to any program
on the employee’s paycheck stub.
By default, the paycheck stub shows only the information that appears on
the EmployEE tab of the Employee Defaults dialog box. But employer’s contri-
butions appear on the EmployER tab of the Employee Defaults dialog box. To
make an employer contribution appear on the paycheck stub, you create a
field on the EmployEE tab. To avoid affecting the employee’s paycheck, make
the field a memo field.
Remember that you use the memo field in addition to (not instead of) the
EmployER field.
Employer contributions to benefit plans are handled as liabilities on the 
balance sheet. As such, to calculate correctly, the formula you use usually
generates a negative number. If you don’t mind showing the contribution as 
a negative value on the employee’s paycheck stub, you can use the same for-
mula for the memo field as you use for the employer’s contribution. However,
you may prefer to show the contribution as a positive number on the check
stub — so that employees doesn’t mistakenly think you deducted the money
from their paychecks. In this case, create another formula that looks just like
the employer contribution formula. However, make sure that you
 Remove the negative sign from the portion of the formula that calculates
the deduction
 Set up the formula type as an Exception rather than a Deduction
Don’t forget to click the Adjust button for the new memo field. Also, make
sure that you include the same fields when calculating the memo field that
you included when calculating the actual employer contribution.
353
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

Adding a 401(k) plan 
to an existing company
Suppose that you’ve been using payroll for a while and your company decides
to implement a 401(k) plan. We’re not going to walk you through setting up a
401(k) plan; you have the Payroll Wizard to help you do that.
The Payroll Wizard assumes that you want to assign contribution percentages
individually to each employee in the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps window. If
your employees’ contribution rates vary greatly, you don’t have much choice.
Choose Maintain➪Employees/Sales Reps and select an employee who partici-
pates in the plan. On the Withholding tab, supply the employee’s contribution
percentage in the 401k% field.
However, if most of your employees contribute the same percentage, you can
save yourself some work (and time). Simply change the 401K EE tax table that
Peachtree creates to calculate the 401(k) contribution using the percentage
that most employees contribute. That way, you need to set up specific per-
centages only for those employees who contribute the different rate — let
Peachtree use a default rate that matches the rate contributed by most
employees. Follow these steps to modify the 401k EE tax table:
1. Choose File➪Payroll Tax Tables➪User-Maintained.
2. Highlight the 401K EE tax table to see its formula (see Figure 19-9).
3. Add the following three lines, placing them at the top of the tax table
or immediately below the first line of the tax table that specifies the
limit (the line begins LIMIT=):
Figure 19-9:
The formula
Peachtree
creates for
a 401K field.
354
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

Be sure you don’t type anything while the formula is highlighted.
To add lines below the first line, place the insertion point at the end of
the first line and press Ctrl+J to start a new blank line. Make sure you
include a semicolon at the end of each line you add.
E=2%;
F=EMP_401K_NUMBER%;
G=If (F=(0),E,F);
In the first line, type the fixed percentage used by most employees — in
our example, we made the percentage 2%.
4. Edit the line that contains the information for the A variable and
replace EMP_401K_NUMBER% with G. After you edit the line, it should
look like this:
A=G*ADJUSTED_GROSS;
5. Click Save.
Next, edit only the records of employees who don’t use the standard rate (2%
in our example) and employees who don’t participate in the 401(k) plan. For
the employees who don’t use the standard rate, choose Maintain➪Employees/
Sales Reps. On the Withholding tab, supply the correct rate in the 401k% field.
For the employees who don’t participate in the 401(k) plan, open the same
window and click the EmployEE Fields tab. Then remove the check mark from
the STD column and the Calc column next to the K401 payroll field.
The modifications to the 401K EE payroll tax table that we suggest change the
way Peachtree calculates the 401(k) contribution. Using our modifications,
Peachtree first checks the rate in the 401k% field on the Withholding Info 
tab of the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps window. If an employee’s rate is 0,
Peachtree uses the default rate specified in the formula stored in the 401K EE
payroll tax table (in our example, 2%) to calculate the employee’s 401(k) con-
tribution. On the other hand, if Peachtree finds a percentage in the 401k%
field in the Maintain Employees/Sales Reps window, Peachtree uses that per-
centage to calculate the 401(k) contribution.
Multiple state withholdings
If your business is located on the border of a state, you might employ people
who live in both the state in which your company is located and in the neigh-
boring state. In this case, your payroll is affected at two levels:
 Typically, you need to pay state unemployment insurance (SUI) for only
the state in which your business is located.
 You must deduct correct state income taxes for employees based on
where they reside, not where your business is located.
355
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

Look first at SUI. When you set up Payroll, Peachtree automatically creates a
payroll field for state unemployment insurance for the state in which your
business is located. Peachtree makes the calculation for each state based on
the employee’s state of residence. So, you need to edit your payroll setup to
tell Peachtree to include all employees, regardless of their residence, when
calculating state unemployment for your company’s state. Follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Payroll Tax Tables➪User-Maintained to display the User-
Maintained Payroll Tax Tables window.
2. Highlight the state unemployment tax table.
Typically, the table’s name is comprised of your two-letter state abbrevi-
ation and the characters SUI. The state unemployment insurance tax table
for Florida, for example, is FLSUI.
3. In the State box, delete the characters that represent the two-letter
abbreviation for your state.
4. Click the Save button to save the tax table.
Next, you need to make sure that Peachtree uses the correct state unemploy-
ment insurance tax table. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees.
2. Click the EmployER Fields tab.
3. Highlight your state unemployment insurance tax table.
4. In the Tax Name box, select your state’s payroll tax table.
In our example, we’d select FLSUI instead of **SUI ER.
5. Click OK.
Last, you need to make sure that all employees’ records use the correct state.
1. Choose Maintain➪Employees/Sales Reps to display the Maintain
Employees/Sales Reps window.
2. Select an employee.
3. On the Withholding Info tab, make sure that the state code matches
the state in which the employee resides.
Local taxes
During the initial payroll setup, you have the opportunity to set up local taxes
as well as state taxes. But suppose your employees live in a variety of locali-
ties instead of just the locality in which your business is located. You need to
356
Part III: The Fancy Stuff 

set up additional tax tables for those other localities and assign them to the
appropriate employees.
The process is similar to setting up payroll for multiple state withholdings.
First, make sure you have another current liability account for local taxes set
up in your Chart of Accounts. Then confirm that you have a Local tax payroll
field set up, and assign it, if necessary, to the correct box on the W-2.
1. Choose Maintain➪Default Information➪Employees to display the
Employee Defaults dialog box.
2. Click the EmployEE Fields tab.
3. If you don’t find a “Local” field, type Local on a blank line and assign
the Local field to the appropriate Other Current Liability account.
4. Click OK to save the field.
5. Reopen the Employee Defaults dialog box by repeating Step 1.
6. On the General tab, click the W-2s button to display the Assign
Payroll Fields for W-2s dialog box.
7. Select the Local payroll field you created from the Local Inc Tax list
box (the last box in the dialog box).
8. Click OK twice to close both dialog boxes.
Next, set up additional local tax tables by following these steps:
1. Choose File➪Payroll Tax Tables➪User-Maintained.
Peachtree displays the User-Maintained Payroll Tax Tables window.
2. Enter a tax ID.
For Marion county, for example, you might use something like MarionXX,
where XX represents the last two digits of the current year.
3. In the Tax Name box, enter the tax ID and follow it with the last two
digits of the current year.
In our example, we’d type MarionXX XX; where the first set of X’s is part
of the Tax ID you created in Step 2, and the second set of X’s again repre-
sents the last two digits of the current year.
4. Set the Government type to Local. In the Local box, type a name for
the locality.
The name can be up to 15 characters long.
5. In the State box (above the Local box), type the two-letter abbrevia-
tion for the state.
6. In the Formula box, type the formula for the locality.
357
Chapter 19: Real-Life Ways to Use Peachtree

Remember to place a semicolon (;) at the end of every line except the
last line and press Ctrl+J to start a new line. The last line should begin
with ANSWER = . A local tax formula might look something like this:
PERCENT = .7;
ANSWER = - PRORATE ((ANNUAL (ADJUSTED_GROSS)) * PERCENT%)
You’d change the percentage amount in the first line to match the per-
centage for your local tax.
7. Click the Save button to save the tax table.
8. Repeat Steps 2–7 for each local tax you need to create and then click
Close.
Last, make sure that you assign each employee to the correct local tax.
Follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Employees/Sales Reps.
2. Select an employee.
3. On the Withholding Info tab, check the following:
• The State/Locality box for the State field contains the two-letter
abbreviation for the state in which the employee resides
• The State/Locality box for the Local field contains the name of one
of the localities you created in the preceding steps
4. Click the EmployEE Fields tab.
5. Find the Local payroll field, remove the check mark from the STD
column and place a check mark in the Calc column.
6. Based on the employee’s locality, select the appropriate payroll tax
table you created in the preceding set of steps.
7. Click the Adjust button for the Local field and place check marks in
the Use boxes for all fields that you want Peachtree to include when
calculating Adjusted Gross Income.
At a minimum, place a check mark in the Use box next to Gross. Ask
your accountant about the others if you’re unsure.
8. Click Save.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
M
ove over David Letterman. Your competition is
here. Not! Our top ten lists aren’t as funny as his,
but they clearly serve a practical purpose.
This part provides remedies to common Peachtree error
messages and offers locations of helpful Web stuff. Ain’t
that special?

Chapter 20
Ten Common Error Messages 
(And What You Can Do 
about Them)
In This Chapter
 Surviving and mastering common errors
S
ometimes computer programs just don’t act the way that you want them
to. At any moment in time, error messages might pop up, throwing most
people into a state of near panic.
This might sound a little strange, but frequently you can fix a problem if you
simply exit Peachtree and restart your computer. Always try shutting down
your computer before any other step. If the problem remains after restarting
your computer, and you’re on a network, try restarting your server. If the
problem still remains after that, look at this chapter or contact technical sup-
port for a resolution.
Although most error messages are easy to fix, if an error occurs because of
data problems, you might need to run a program called Data Verification.
Contact Peachtree or your Peachtree consultant before you attempt to run
Data Verification or its more powerful counterpart, Integrity Check. You
might notice that we don’t even include the instructions for running Data
Verification or Integrity Check anywhere in this book. We leave it out on 
purpose!
Here’s a valuable piece of advice: Don’t run Data Verification or Integrity
Check unless you really know what you’re doing and always make a backup
before you run the program. We don’t mean to scare you, but trust us on this
one . . . we found that out the hard way.

Period Changed to ## Due 
to Unposted Entries There
Our clients call us about this error message more than any other. This error
usually occurs when you’re using the real-time posting method and when
you’re trying to change your accounting period. It means that Peachtree
improperly posted one or more transactions. Usually, but not always, the
error occurs if you interrupt Peachtree’s posting process. You can usually
repair the problem by changing to a batch posting method, posting all jour-
nals and changing back to a real-time posting method.
To correct the error, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Company Information to display the Maintain
Company Information dialog box.
2. Click the arrow next to Posting Method to display the Posting Method
dialog box.
3. Change the Posting Method to Batch posting and then click OK twice.
4. Choose Tasks➪System➪Post to display the Post dialog box.
5. Click OK.
Peachtree now posts any unposted entries.
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 3, selecting Real-time posting in Step 3 instead
of Batch posting.
Now you’re able to change your accounting period.
Not a Valid Date in This Period
This error occurs when you attempt to enter a transaction with a date in a
prior period. Peachtree allows you to date a transaction in the current period
or in a future period but gives you this error message if you attempt to create
and post a transaction to an earlier period. You have three choices at this
point:
 Change the accounting period to the period in which you need the trans-
action posted.
 Go ahead and post the transaction with a date in the current month, 
and then edit the transaction in question and put a prior period date 
on it. Peachtree gives you a warning message that you’re modifying a
362
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

transaction that’s not in the current period. Click Yes, and Peachtree
posts the transaction in the previous period. This method is our per-
sonal favorite, although Peachtree doesn’t allow this method in Payroll
Entry.
 Leave the transaction dated in the current period (not recommended if
you really want the transaction dated in a prior period).
The Record You Are Trying to Access 
Is Currently in Use
This error, which also includes the message “Please try again when it is avail-
able,” occurs when you attempt to select, use, or modify a customer, vendor,
item, employee, job, and so on when you or another user on your network
has the respective Maintain window open. To access the record in question,
the user who has the maintenance window open needs to close it.
No Forms to Print
Peachtree displays this message in a couple of different situations:
 If you try to print forms, such as invoices or checks, and Peachtree
determines no transactions meet the requirements you specified. For
example, you tell Peachtree to print invoices, but no invoices exist with-
out an invoice number. (Remember that Peachtree chooses invoices or
checks that need to be printed if they don’t have a reference number.)
Sometimes Peachtree displays the No forms to print message if
when you created these transactions, you dated them for a future date,
such as tomorrow. Unless you change the Last Date for which the
invoices will print in the options dialog box, Peachtree assumes that you
want to print only the forms dated today or earlier.
 If you try to reprint a customer statement after updating the customer
file.
This Program Has Performed
an Illegal Operation
First of all, you haven’t done anything illegal. Rest assured that you don’t
have to live in fear that the software police are going to knock at your door
and haul you away to jail (or the hoosegow, as grandma called it).
363
Chapter 20: Ten Common Error Messages (And What You Can Do about Them)

Frequently, programs just decide that they won’t play nice any more, so you
see this error message. There are too many reasons to list that can cause a
program to crash, but usually you can just restart the program. If that doesn’t
work, reboot your computer and then start the program. If that doesn’t work,
try reinstalling the program, and if that still doesn’t work, you need to contact
a consultant or Best Software, the company that manufactures Peachtree.
GL Does Not Foot
This message occasionally appears when you attempt to print a General
Ledger report. To correct the error, you need to access and run Peachtree’s
Integrity Check and run the Data Synchronization Test for Chart of Accounts/
Journal.
Don’t run Integrity Check unless you really know what you’re doing. We sug-
gest that you contact Peachtree or your Peachtree consultant before you run
Integrity Check, and always make a backup before proceeding.
Could Not Find the xxx Single 
(Or Married) Calculation
This message occurs when you’re trying to generate a paycheck and the pay-
roll tax tables haven’t been updated. We cover updating the tax tables in
Chapter 17.
File System Error 11 or 35
This message usually appears if you’re on a network and the network has lost
connection to the Peachtree data file location or lost mapping to a network
drive. It can also occur if you move your Peachtree data files to a different
drive or folder. If it occurs because of a network issue, contact your network
administrator.
If you’ve recently moved the Peachtree data files, you need to modify
Peachtree’s INI file (pronounced inny). You need to know the location of the
Peachtree data files before you can modify the INI file.
364
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

1. Open the Windows Explorer program, locate the Windows folder, and
locate the following file:
• Peachtree First Accounting R2004 — PFA110.INI
• Peachtree First Accounting R2005 — PFA120.INI
• Peachtree Accounting R2004 — PAW110.INI
• Peachtree Accounting R2005 — PAW120.INI
• Peachtree Complete Accounting R2004 — PCW110.INI
• Peachtree Complete Accounting R2005 — PCW120.INI
• Peachtree Premium Accounting R2004 — PPA110.INI
• Peachtree Premium Accounting R2005 — PPA120.INI
2. After you locate the correct INI file, double-click the filename to open
it in the Windows Notepad program.
3. Look for the line that reads DATAPATH=.
4. Change this line to the correct Peachtree data directory.
For example, suppose that you originally stored the Peachtree data files
on your local hard drive and you moved them to the network drive F:
into the ACCTG folder.
The datapath line in the INI file originally reads something like this:
DATAPATH=C:\PEACHW\.
After you modify the line to the preceding scenario, it reads
DATAPATH=F:\ACCTG\.
Don’t include your company folder in the data path. Doing so overwrites
tax files and confuses Peachtree as to which files are program files and
which files are your company data files.
5. Choose File➪Save.
6. Choose File➪Exit.
7. Restart Peachtree.
There Was No Room to Store Those Printer
Setup Parameters in the Form File
This message almost always appears when using a customized form and cer-
tain printers. Switch to a generic version of the printer driver. Also make sure
that you’re using a newer version of Peachtree. The older versions really
don’t play well with newer printers.
365
Chapter 20: Ten Common Error Messages (And What You Can Do about Them)

I/O Errors
I/O errors are Input/Output errors and mean that Peachtree might be having
a problem reading or writing data to your computer’s hard disk. Frequently,
this means that there’s a problem with your disk drive or transmission across
your network. Contact your hardware specialist to check your system. I/O
errors can cause irreparable data corruption. If your data becomes cor-
rupted, you must restore a backup, restart your Peachtree company from
scratch, or send your data out for repair. See Chapter 21 for information on
data repair resources.

you can purchase from Peachtree. For example, you can find information on
Peachtree’s direct deposit service that enables you to offer your employees
the benefit of paychecks directly deposited into their bank accounts.

Peachtree For Dummies, 2nd Edition,
Extra Information
www.dummies.com/go/peachtreefd
We have so much information to share with you about Peachtree, but there
just isn’t enough space in the book to put it all. The kind folks at Wiley have
posted a companion Web site for some of this additional information. We
think that you’ll find it very useful.
Just in case you didn’t see the commercial announcements that we make in
this book, we’re giving you one more. Visit Wiley’s Web site to purchase addi-
tional copies of this book and check out all the other great For Dummies
books available (www.dummies.com).

letter that’s designed to help you use Peachtree more efficiently. (Diane has
written several articles for them, too!) The publication tries to address the
ways that people can use Peachtree to handle real business situations. The

businesses. With a portfolio of business loans, loan guarantees, and disaster
loans, the SBA is the nation’s largest single financial backer of small busi-
nesses. Last year, the SBA offered management and technical assistance to
more than one million small business owners and played a major role in the
government’s disaster relief efforts by making low-interest recovery loans to
both homeowners and businesses.

I
f old Blue Eyes (that’s Frank Sinatra for all of you who are too young to
remember) could do it his way, so can you. Peachtree allows customiza-
tion of how the program reacts to different things you do.
In this chapter, you discover how to customize settings such as the way that
numbers display when you type them in, the colors that display, and the
fields that you see on your screen during data entry.
Setting Global Options
You can use the Global Options feature to set the way Peachtree functions, as
well as to select the color of your Peachtree windows. After all, you do want
to make sure that it matches your office décor, don’t you? The options con-
tain various options that control the behavior, look, and feel of the program.
If you operate on a network, each workstation can apply its own options.
To set the global options, choose Options➪Global. The Maintain Global
Options dialog box appears with the Accounting tab in the front, as shown
in Figure 1.
If you have multiple users, each user can set his or her own global option
preferences. See Chapter 18 for information on setting up users. 

The Accounting tab
The first section of the Accounting tab determines how Peachtree inserts
decimal points and how many decimal points to use. You have a choice
between allowing the Peachtree program to place a decimal point in figures
and entering the decimal point yourself.
If you select the Automatic option, Peachtree inserts the decimal point before
the last two digits of the number. For example, if you type 10, Peachtree enters
it as 0.10; however, if you select the Manual option for the decimal point entry,
Peachtree enters 10 as 10.00.
Most people prefer to set the decimal point entry to Manual. This option
affects any field that requires numbers, whether a Quantity field or a Price
field.
Use the second section on the Accounting tab to optionally hide the general
ledger account number fields in certain task windows. Transactions created
with the GL account number hidden automatically use the default general
ledger accounts that you have set up. (You can find out how to set default
general ledger accounts in Chapter 4.)
You can hide general ledger accounts in the following task areas:
 Accounts Receivable: Select this option to hide G/L accounts in the
Quotes, Sales Orders, Sales Invoicing, and Receipts windows.
 Accounts Payable: Select this option to hide G/L accounts in the
Purchase Orders, Purchases/Receive Inventory, and Payments windows.
 Payroll Entry: Select this option to hide G/L accounts in the Payroll
Entry window.
Figure 1:

dialog box.

Peachtree For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

For example, selecting the Accounts Receivable option changes the look of
the Sales/Invoicing window. The Accounts Receivable account and the G/L
account field of each line item are hidden. When you enter a sales invoice,
Peachtree uses the sales default G/L account set up for the customer in
Maintain Customers/Prospects. If you select an inventory item, Peachtree
uses the default G/L accounts set up in Maintain Inventory Items for this
item.
Should you hide these accounts? Well, look at it this way. If your chart of
accounts has one G/L sales account and one accounts receivable account that
you use most of the time, then these numbers would never change, so you may
as well hide them. You can then generate your invoice faster because you don’t
have to press the Tab key in these fields when you create an invoice. If, how-
ever, the G/L sales account number changes depending on the product or ser-
vice provided, you should leave the account numbers displayed so that you
can change them as necessary.
If you have chosen the Hide General Ledger Accounts option, you can view
and change the transaction’s G/L accounts by selecting the Journal button in
various task windows.
Other options on the Accounting tab include:
 Warn If a Record Was Changed but Not Saved: When you select this
option, Peachtree displays a warning if you try to exit a new or modified
record without saving it. If you deselect this option, you won’t see the
warning. We strongly recommend that you select this option.
 Hide Inactive Records: When you select this option, Peachtree doesn’t
display inactive records in the lookup lists. (Lookup lists are the ones
with the magnifying glass.)
 Recalculate Cash Balance Automatically in Receipts, Payments, and
Payroll Entry: When you select this option, Peachtree automatically
updates the Cash Balance fields in the Receipts, Payments, and Payroll
Entry windows as you post or save transactions. The balance displays
as of the date that appears in the task window. Checking this option can
slightly slow down Peachtree’s response time when saving transactions.
 Use Timeslips Accounting Link: If you also use the Timeslips program,
you can electronically transfer revenue information from Timeslips to
Peachtree’s general ledger. 
The last option on this tab controls how Peachtree handles a secondary sort.
In a large number of reports and in the Open dialog box where you select a
transaction for editing, you can sort the information by date. If two or more
transactions have the same date, the option you select here determines how
Peachtree sorts the matching items: either by the transaction reference
number such as the invoice or check number or by the order in which you
entered the transactions.

Bonus Chapter 1: Customizing the Way You Work

The General tab
The General tab shown in Figure 2 includes features that affect Peachtree’s
performance as well as the visual color schemes. If you change a color
scheme preference, you must exit and restart Peachtree before the color
changes take effect.
The first two options affect how Peachtree performs:
 Do Not Print Total Page Length of Reports in Report Headers: When
you deselect this option, Peachtree calculates the total number of pages
in a report before printing the report. Selecting this option allows reports
to print faster, skipping the initial calculation of the total number of pages
prior to printing. Instead of displaying “page 1 of 12” or “page 2 of 12” in
the report header, your reports will display “page 1” or “page 2.”
Quite honestly, we think the time saved by using the first option in the
General tab is minimal and having the total number of pages is very
useful, so we suggest that you do not activate this feature.
 Do Not Show Quantity on Hand in Inventory Item Lookups: Selecting
this option speeds up the display of inventory item lookup lists because
it skips the process of calculating each item’s current quantity on hand
every time you display the inventory item lookup list. 
Depending on the configuration of your computer, you may or may not see a
noticeable improvement when selecting these performance options.
In the Line Item Entry Display section, you can determine whether Peachtree
displays one or two lines for each line item in the various task windows. For
example, two-line entry displays the name and description of the account,
while single-line entry allows display of more items on the window.

Using the options in the Smart Data Entry section, you can enable lookup
lists to display instantly and anticipate what you want to enter. These options
make data entry faster in most cases. Unless you have a very slow computer,
you’ll probably want both of these features activated:
 Automatic Field Completion: Anticipates what you’re typing by filling in
the field with the nearest match to the characters you enter as you type
them. With it, you can avoid having to type all characters.
 Drop-Down List Displays Automatically: Allows Peachtree to automati-
cally display a list of choices when you place the insertion point in a
lookup field and type at least one character.
In the Color Scheme section, you can select colors for Peachtree windows
and dialog boxes. When you select a color scheme, this default affects all
Peachtree companies you open at this computer.
These color schemes apply only to windows and dialog boxes within the
Peachtree program, not to other Windows applications or the Windows 
desktop.
Last, you see the Reset button; as you work in Peachtree, you will see mes-
sages that you can disable. The Reset button reactivates any disabled mes-
sages so that they appear when the respective condition warrants it.
The Spelling tab
Spelling errors can ruin the professional impression that you’re trying to main-
tain. If your flying fingers frequently fumble (wasn’t that a great alliteration?)
on the keyboard, Peachtree can show you the error of your ways and often
offer corrections. By default, Peachtree will check spelling in most task win-
dows and note fields as you work, highlighting misspelled words in red as you
type them. Right-click on a misspelled word to see a list of suggested replace-
ment words and click the word you want in place of the misspelled word.
If the word is spelled correctly but Peachtree doesn’t recognize it — it may
be a term specific to your industry, for example — you can add the word to
the dictionary so that Peachtree recognizes it as a correctly spelled word in
the future. You manage your spelling preferences using the Spelling tab of the
Maintain Global Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 3.
In the Spelling tab, you can set up Peachtree to check spelling when you save
or close a transaction as well as control the speed of the Spell Check feature. 
You can speed up the spell-checking process if you take advantage of
Peachtree’s ability to automatically correct spellings that you identify. This
feature is very useful in helping you correct typing mistakes that you make
5
Bonus Chapter 1: Customizing the Way You Work

on a regular basis or recognizing special terms you use on a regular basis. For
example, if you regularly type “teh” instead of “the,” set up an autocorrect
action to make Peachtree automatically replace “teh” with “the” every time
you type it — without asking you about it.
Use this feature to store abbreviations for long words or phrases. For exam-
ple, you can store an acronym like “ssa” and tell Peachtree to replace it with
“Social Security Administration.” 
To add words or phrases to a custom dictionary, follow these steps:
1. Choose Options➪Global to open the Maintain Global Options dialog
box; click the Spelling tab.
2. Click the Custom Dictionary button.
Peachtree displays the Custom Dictionary dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 4.

3. In the Words text box, type the misspelling you want corrected. 
4. In the Other Word text box, type the correct spelling.
5. From the Action drop-down list, select the Auto Change (Use Case of
Checked Word) option.
6. Click the Add Word button. 
Peachtree adds the misspelled word and its correction to the list.
Repeat Steps 3 through 6 for each misspelled word you want Peachtree
to automatically correct.
7. Click the Close button, and then in the Maintain Global Options dialog
box, click OK.
Whenever you type one of these words that you added, Peachtree replaces it
with the replacement word you provided. Note that you must type the word
that you added exactly as you added it — if you added “ssa” and you type
SSA, Peachtree will not make the replacement.
Hiding the Start Screen
One click, two clicks, three clicks, four. Sort of reminds you of the old one-
potato game you played as a kid, doesn’t it? It usually takes four clicks (some-
times more) to actually get into your company data in Peachtree. Wouldn’t it
be nice to narrow that down to a single click? You can if you hide the Start
Screen. That way, Peachtree opens directly into the last company you used.
Hide the Start screen by choosing Options➪Show Start Screen at Startup to
remove the check mark from the option. 
Display the Start Screen at any time by choosing File➪Open Start Screen.
Navigating Peachtree
We all know that some people are more analytical by nature, while others are
more artistic and graphical. Peachtree includes a feature designed to satisfy
the appetites of those with the graphical eye. It’s called the Navigation Bar
and is a small bar that can appear at the bottom of your screen, just below
the main application toolbar. You use the navigation aids as an alternate
method to open transaction and maintenance windows or to run reports. 
If your Navigation Bar is not turned on, display it by choosing Options➪View
Navigation Aid. The Navigation Bar includes a tab for each Peachtree major
program area including Sales, Purchases, and Payroll. 
7
Bonus Chapter 1: Customizing the Way You Work

Peachtree includes the navigation aids as part of Peachtree Today window.
Click any feature to quickly open the applicable window, as shown in Figure 5.
You can find out more about the Peachtree Today window in Chapter 19.
Customizing the Toolbar
In Chapter 1, we mention the toolbar that displays icons for access to many
frequently used Peachtree features. You can customize the toolbar to better
meet your needs. For example, if you frequently access the Shipments fea-
ture, adding it to your toolbar would reduce access to a single mouse click.
The following steps show you how to customize the application toolbar:
1. Choose Options➪Customize Toolbar.
The Toolbar Components dialog box, shown in Figure 6, appears with
folders representing most of the Peachtree menus.
2. Click the plus sign (+) next to the folder containing the feature you
want to add.

3. Select the desired component and drag it to the toolbar, releasing the
mouse button when the I beam at the end of the mouse pointer
reaches the toolbar position you want.
Peachtree adds a button for the tool on the toolbar.
With the Customize Toolbar dialog box open, drag any unwanted compo-
nent off the toolbar to remove it.
4. Click OK. 
Customizing Data Entry Windows
Over the years, our clients have commented that they want to be able to
enter their data quickly and go on to the next project. To aid in this goal,
Peachtree allows you to modify several of the Peachtree windows to display
certain portions of the window while hiding others. For example, if your busi-
ness doesn’t use job costing, why not hide the Job text box in the Sales/
Invoicing or Purchases/Receive Inventory windows? By hiding a portion of
the window, the person entering the data skips the hidden areas, which
allows for faster data entry.
You can use these customized windows, known as templates, to enter data in
the following task windows: Quotes, Sales Orders, Sales/Invoicing, Purchase
Orders, and Purchases/Receive Inventory.
Figure 6:

9
Bonus Chapter 1: Customizing the Way You Work

Customizing a template only modifies the data entry window. It does not
change the way a form prints.
For example, you can remove the Jobs and Ship To information from the
Sales/Invoicing window. To customize the data entry window:
1. Choose Tasks➪Sales/Invoicing to display the Sales/Invoicing window.
2. Click the Template button on the Sales/Invoicing toolbar.
A listing of available templates appears, with a check mark next to the
template currently in use.
You can’t edit or delete predefined templates. To customize a template,
you must first create a new, customized template.
3. From the list of templates, click Customize Templates.
The Maintain Sales/Invoicing Templates window appears.
4. Click in the Template ID text box and type a unique name for the 
template.
For example, you might want to use your company’s name.
5. Press the Tab key and enter a description of the template.
Now you can determine which fields you want to be hidden during data
entry. Some fields are required and cannot be hidden.
6. Click the word <Show> next to the field you want to hide or click
<Hide> to display a hidden field.
The word <Show> changes to <Hide>, which indicates that you want to
hide the field.
In Figure 7, you see that the Ship To: and the Job fields are marked as
<Hide>. Note that fields marked as <Required> can’t be hidden.

Select the Set Template as Default check box if you want to use this tem-
plate each time you open the task window.
7. When you finish choosing the fields that you do not want to display,
click the Save button and then click the Close button.
To see the changes, you need to close the current window and then reopen it.
Simplifying Repetitive Transactions
Memorized transactions can save you a great deal of time in repetitive data
entry tasks. Because they’re different from recurring transactions, you can
use memorized transactions repeatedly and at whatever time interval you
choose. You can enter memorized transactions for General Journal entries,
Quotes, Sales Invoices, Purchase Orders, and Payments. (But for some odd
reason, you can’t create memorized Purchases. We don’t know why.)
With memorized transactions, you can enter the G/L accounts and general
information without knowing an exact amount. They are great for transac-
tions that occur irregularly because they do not automatically post and you
can use them as needed.
Creating memorized transactions
Suppose that you sell a product line in which a customer will probably need
several parts at once, instead of just one part. By creating a memorized Sales
Invoice, each time one of these units is sold, you won’t need to look up or
enter the invoice information. In our sample company, we sell bird feeders.
When a customer orders two bird feeders and poles, we give the customer
the birdseed at no charge. To create a memorized transaction to store the
invoice information, follow these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Memorized Transactions
A submenu of available memorized transactions types appears.
2. Select the type of transaction, which in this case, is Sales Invoices.
The Maintain Memorized Sales Invoices window appears.
3. Enter an ID and description that defines the transaction.
IDs can be up to 20 alphanumeric characters, whereas the description
can be up to 30 characters in length.
11
Bonus Chapter 1: Customizing the Way You Work

4. If you’re designing this memorized invoice for a specific customer,
enter the customer’s ID in the Customer ID text box; otherwise, leave
the Customer ID text box blank so that you can use it for any of your
customers.
5. Enter the transaction information and then click the Save button.
Did you notice that this transaction does not have an invoice number or
date? That’s because not all transaction fields are maintained in memorized
transactions. The date and invoice number fields display when you actually
use the memorized transaction.
Using memorized transactions
You can use a memorized transaction at any time. To see how to use the
invoice we create in the preceding section, follow these steps:
1. Choose Task➪Sales/Invoicing (or whatever type of transaction you
want to use) to display a task window.
2. Click the arrow to the right of the Open button and click Select.
The Select Memorized Transaction dialog box appears, displaying all the
memorized transactions relative to the current window. 
3. Click the transaction you want to use and then click OK.
Voilà! The invoice information appears. You only need to enter the header
information such as customer name, invoice number, date, and so forth. You
can edit the transaction lines as needed. We told you this could save you time!
You can find out how to enter invoices in Chapter 7.
You can enter and save existing transactions as memorized transactions for
later use. After entering the transaction, choose Edit➪Save as Memorized
Transaction. Enter an ID and description for the transaction.
Action Items: May I Have 
Your Attention, Please?
Because being busy is part of daily life, overlooking a circumstance you
intended to monitor does happen. Peachtree includes Action Items that
assist you in tracking events and situations that are most important to your
business. In the Action Items window, you can create events to keep track of
certain occurrences or to remind you when a particular situation occurs. 
12
Peachtree For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

A strange turn of events
Are you a Post-It note fanatic? Is your desk littered with lots of little notes
with no clear place to put them yet you know they are important? If these
notes pertain to customers, vendors, or employees, you may want to take a
look at Peachtree’s Event feature.
Turning off the automatic events
We all know that too much of a good thing is not so good. So it is with the
event log. By default, Peachtree keeps a log file of every type of transaction
you make for customers, vendors, and employees. Now we’re not talking
about the journals where the actual transactions are stored. No, we’re talking
about a second place to store a list of transactions. Although the log file is
nice enough feature, Peachtree’s default event log settings tend to clutter a
very useful screen with redundant data. 
We recommend that you turn off the event log’s automatic features and only
create events when you want them.
To turn off the automatic events, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tasks➪Action Items.
The Action Items window opens.
2. Click the Options button.
3. Click the Transactions tab and remove all the check marks from the
Create Event column. (See Figure 8.)
4. Click OK and then click the Close button.
Peachtree no longer automatically creates transactions into the Event
Log file.
Creating your own events
Suppose that you’ve contacted a delinquent customer and would like to make
a note of the conversation, or perhaps an employee received a favorable
comment from a customer or a reprimand for being late. Maybe your favorite
vendor sales representative has promised you a special discount on your
next order. For notes like these, you can effectively use Peachtree’s event log.
Throw those Post-It notes away! Well, okay, if you don’t want to throw them
away, you can stick them on the cat!
You can create events from the Maintain Customers, Vendor, or Employees
windows; from most task windows involving customers, vendors, or employ-
ees; or even from the Action Items window (also available under the Tasks
menu).
13
Bonus Chapter 1: Customizing the Way You Work

For this example, we create an event note tracking a telephone call we
received about one of our employees:
1. Choose Maintain➪Employees/Sales Reps to display the Maintain
Employees/Sales Rep window.
Optionally, open the Maintain Customer/Prospects or Maintain Vendor
windows to enter events pertaining to customers or vendors.
2. Click the Event button to reveal the Create Event window, as shown in
Figure 9.
Click the Open button to modify an existing event.
3. Choose the employee ID from the ID lookup list.
4. Optionally, change the date of the event.
You can type the event date or select a date from the calendar icon.
5. Select the option that best describes the note you want to make in the
Event Type section.
If you select the Other option, you can write your own description for
the type of event.

6. Type a note describing the event (for example, a telephone conversa-
tion) in the Note text box.
You can enter up to 255 characters in the Note text box. To start a new
paragraph in the Note text box, press Ctrl+Enter.
7. Click the Save button, and then close the Event window.
Looking at the event log
You can access the event log through the Maintain Customers, Vendors, or
Employees windows. You can see or print all the events pertaining to a cus-
tomer, vendor, or employee by following these steps:
1. Choose Maintain➪Employees/Sales Reps (or Customer/Prospects or
Vendors).
The Maintain Employees/Sales Rep (or Customer/Prospects or Vendors)
window appears.
2. Enter the employee ID in the Employee ID text box or choose it from
the lookup list.
3. Click the Log button and Peachtree displays the log file. 
To print the event log, click the Print button.
Making a to-do list
One of the more useful Action Items features is creating a to-do list. Keeping
track of the things you need to do with the Action Items feature is like having
your own little Personal Information Manger (PIM) stored right in Peachtree.
Figure 9:

Bonus Chapter 1: Customizing the Way You Work

Follow these steps to use the Action Items feature:
1. Choose Tasks➪Action Items to display the Action Items window.
2. Click the To Do tab.
Use the To Do tab to set up a list of tasks that you need to complete.
These tasks are not associated with a vendor, customer, or employee.
3. Enter a date for the first To Do item.
Peachtree assumes that you want to accomplish this task as of the cur-
rent date.
4. Click the Notes section of the first line and type your first task.
After you complete a task, select the Complete check box at the beginning of
the line. To hide completed items, click the arrow next to the drop-down list
that says All To Do’s and Events (at the top of the window) and choose
Uncompleted Events. Peachtree then hides the completed events.
Although you see only eight lines for to-do items, when you reach the last line
and press the Tab key in the Notes text box, Peachtree creates a new line and
adds a scroll bar.
Other useful buttons are the Delete button to delete a selected to-do task and
the Print button to print a copy of your to-do list.
When you click the Close button, Peachtree automatically saves the to-do list
for you.
Setting alerts
Alerts are conditions that you want to be aware of as they happen so that you
can take further action. Alerts might warn you of low inventory, a customer
credit card about to expire, or an employee working too much overtime. When
the conditions for an alert are met, Peachtree can display it on an alert list or
send someone an e-mail about the condition. You can create alerts for employ-
ees, vendors, customers, inventory items, and general ledger accounts that
meet certain criteria. Follow these steps to create an alert:
1. Choose Tasks➪Action Items to display the Action Items window.
2. To create a new alert condition, click the Alert button.
The Set Company Alerts dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10.
16
Peachtree For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

3. Click the next available blank line in the list. 
4. Click the E-mail check box if you want to send an e-mail message noti-
fying someone of the alert condition. 
You enter the e-mail recipient information in the bottom section of the
window; alternatively, click the arrow next to a recipient box to display a
list of all customer, vendor, and employee e-mail addresses stored within
Peachtree.
To generate e-mail messages from within Peachtree, you must have a
MAPI-compliant, default e-mail application installed on your computer.
If your default e-mail system is AOL, you will not be able to send e-mail
alerts from Peachtree, because AOL is not a fully MAPI-compliant e-mail
application.
5. Select whether the alert condition applies to a customer, vendor,
employee, inventory item, or G/L account, as well as which customer,
vendor, employee, or G/L accounts you want to include.
Peachtree does not allow you to leave fields blank or amounts at zero.
6. Select the information type you want the alert condition to monitor. 
The available options depend on whether you are monitoring a cus-
tomer, vendor, inventory item, or G/L account.
7. Select the condition you want to monitor and enter an amount appro-
priate to the type of information you have chosen.
The choices you see vary depending on the type of alert selected.

Finding Transactions
Sherlock Holmes, where are you? Looking for specific transactions can be
time consuming and feel like detective work. In many cases, the Customer
and Vendor ledger reports give a lot of information, but what about employ-
ees? What if you’re looking for inventory information that could be affecting a
customer and a vendor? Fortunately, Peachtree includes a feature called Find
Transactions that makes your sleuthing work much easier. 
You can activate the Find Transaction feature at any time or from any window
in Peachtree. To search for transactions, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Find Transactions or press Ctrl+F.
The Find Transactions window opens, showing a number of conditions
by which to search. 
2. Enter the criteria you want to search for. 
You can use any option by itself or in combination with another option.
If you combine two options, Peachtree searches for a transaction that
matches both criteria. Here are the conditions you can use to search:
• Date: Find transactions based on To and From dates.
• Transaction Type: Find transactions based on the type of transac-
tion such as Invoice, Purchase, or Inventory Adjustment.
• Reference Number: Find transactions based on the transaction ref-
erence number. You entered this number when you created the
transactions. For payments, the reference number usually refers to
the check number.
• Customer, Vendor, or Employee ID: Find transactions for a spe-
cific or range of customers, vendors, or employees.
• Job ID: Find transactions related to a specified job.
• Item ID: Find transactions related to a specified inventory item.
• Transaction Amount: Find transactions equal to, greater than, less
than, or within a specified dollar range.
• General Ledger Account: Find transactions that affect specified
G/L accounts.

Figure 11 shows an example. We want to see any sale this year for one of
our items where the total invoice amount was greater than $5000.00. We
let the Find Transactions feature do the detective work for us.
3. Click the Find button.
Peachtree searches all journals for any transactions referring to the
field(s) data you specify. The results display at the bottom of the Find
Transactions window.
You can’t print the Find results.
The window lists each transaction with the date, type, reference, ID, name,
and amount. The Type field indicates the source of the transaction. Table 1
shows the possible transaction types as well as the name of their respective
journals and the source of the reference.

Managing Your Business’s Money
In This Chapter
 Understanding the Managers
 Using Peachtree Today
A
ccounting for the money is only half the battle. Managing the money is
the rest. In addition to helping you account for your money, Peachtree
contains some tools that help you manage your money. We explore those
tools in this chapter.
Meet the Financial Manager
Peachtree’s Financial Manager can give you a quick view of your financial pic-
ture. It displays an overview of key ratios and key balances that can help you
check the pulse of your business without analyzing reports.
Business Summary
Choose Analysis➪Financial Manager to see the window shown in Figure 1. By
default, Peachtree displays the Business Summary view, which contains four
panes of financial information presented as percentages.
If you prefer, you can see click the S.Sheet button to view the numbers in the
row/column format presented by spreadsheets. You can also set the “as of”
date to any date as far back as the first open period.
Financial analysts and bankers calculate dozens of ratios to help them under-
stand the financial picture of a company. Peachtree provides some of the more
basic ones in the Business Summary view, using information you can find on
your income statement and balance sheet.

The numbers you see in the four panes of the Business Summary are percent-
ages, but we describe ratios here. You must multiply the result of each of the
following calculations by 100 to adjust for percentages. Remember that high
school math? (Ugh!)
Ratios by themselves are meaningless; you need to compare the ratios to
either historical data for your company or to other companies in your indus-
try. You may want to take a look at Leo Troy’s Almanac of Business and
Industrial Financial Ratios 2003 (published by Aspen Publishers, Inc.). You can
purchase the book from several vendors, including www.amazon.com.
Operational analysis
To calculate the Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Sales, Peachtree uses your
income statement and divides Total Cost of Sales by Total Revenues. The
higher the ratio, the more it costs you to make your sales — reducing your
gross profit.
To calculate Gross Profit as a Percentage of Sales, again, Peachtree uses your
income statement and divides Gross Profit by Total Revenues. This ratio plus
the previous ratio will total 100 percent, so you can expect that a lower ratio
indicates that your cost of sales is high.
To calculate Net Income as a Percentage of Sales, Peachtree again uses your
income statement and divides Net Income by Total Revenues. This ratio takes
into consideration both your cost of sales and your operating expenses. A
higher ratio means that you’ve kept your expenses down.

Peachtree For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Profitability
To calculate Return on Total Assets as a percentage, Peachtree uses both your
income statement and your balance sheet, dividing Net Income on your income
statement by Total Assets on your balance sheet. If the resulting ratio is high,
either you have a high profit margin or you turn over your assets quickly.
To calculate Return on Net Worth as a percentage, Peachtree again uses both
your income statement and your balance sheet and divides Net Income by
Total Equity (or Capital). The higher the ratio, the better, because it indicates
that you’re making more money on the money you invested.
Resource management
In the Resource Management section, Peachtree lists your Current Assets and
Current Liabilities (both found on your balance sheet) and then calculates the
Current Ratio by dividing Current Assets by Current Liabilities. The Current
Ratio gives you a measure of your ability to cover your debts with your assets
in case of an emergency. A number less than 1 indicates that your assets would
not cover your liabilities.
Working capital
To calculate Inventory Turnover, Peachtree uses both the income statement
and the balance sheet and divides Total Cost of Sales by Inventory. This ratio
helps you measure how long items remain in inventory before you sell them.
A higher number indicates that you keep items in inventory longer.
The Days A/R Outstanding entry represents the average length of time
(in days)that your receivables remain outstanding. To calculate Days A/R
Outstanding, Peachtree first divides Total Sales by the number of days in
the period — call the result “Sales Per Day.” Then Peachtree divides Average
Accounts Receivable for the period by Sales Per Day to determine the aver-
age number of days receivables remain outstanding.
Key Balances
The Key Balances window (see Figure 2) provides key balances for certain bal-
ance sheet accounts and, in the Operations section, a summarized version of
your income statement. Click the Key Balances option to switch to this view.
While viewing Key Balances, you can click the S.Sheet button to have
Peachtree display corresponding monthly values.

Understanding the Cash Manager
“I really need to know how much cash I’m going to have at the end of the
month.” Have you heard yourself say that? Let Peachtree’s Cash Manager do
the math for you.
The Cash Manager window, shown in Figure 3, shows you the company’s
expected cash balance for a particular date, taking into consideration sales
you are due to collect (outstanding receivables), payments you are due to
make (outstanding payables), payroll you are due to meet, and any cash
adjustments. To open this window, choose Analysis➪Cash Manager.
If you use batch posting, you need to post before using the information in
this window to get an accurate picture of your cash position.
To calculate the first Starting Cash balance shown on the screen, Peachtree
sums the balances in all accounts you defined as cash accounts in your Chart
of Accounts. All subsequent starting cash balances equal the ending cash bal-
ance from the prior period. You can change the forecast frequency from its
default of “Weekly” to “Biweekly” or “Monthly” using the Forecast list box.
You can view the information in the Cash Manager window in graph format
by clicking the Graph option, or you can switch to spreadsheet view by click-
ing the S.Sheet button.

Peachtree For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Suppose that you’re hoping to close a large deal — and you’d like to see what
the cash picture will look like if you’re successful. Or suppose that you might
buy a truck during the time period and you’d like to include the effects of the
down payment in Cash Manager. You can include these “what if” scenarios in
the Cash Adjustments lines. To add cash to the picture, double-click any
number on the Cash Adjustments (+) line. To subtract cash from the picture,
double-click any number on the Cash Adjustments (–) line. Peachtree dis-
plays the spreadsheet view for the appropriate adjustments line. Record the
adjustment in the appropriate column (the column headings are dates) and
click the Numeric button to redisplay the view shown in Figure 3. If you click
Save, you can review the adjustments at a later time when you return to the
Cash Manager window.
To subtract cash, record the adjustment using the Cash Adjustments (–) line
and enter a positive, not a negative, number.
Using the Payment Manager
The Payments Manager can help you select and pay bills. When you open the
Payment Manager window by choosing Analysis➪Payment Manager, you see
the window shown in Figure 4.

Bonus Chapter 2: Managing Your Business’s Money

Even if your business operates on a cash basis, you’ll see bills in this window.
You can view the information numerically by clicking the Numeric option.
The information Peachtree presents is aged like the balances you see on the
Aged Payables report. You typically set the As of Date box to today’s date,
but you can change it, too. You can use a date in the Show list box to com-
pare last month to this month or this month last year to this month this year
date. Initially, the date in the Show box matches the As of Date.
Suppose that you want to see the details that make up the 61-90 bar. Double-
click the bar, and a window appears like the one shown in Figure 5.

Place a check mark next to bills that you want to pay and click the Check
button at the top of the window. Peachtree allows you to select a form and
print checks for the selected bills.
Using the Collection Manager
Managing Accounts Receivable can be critical to the survival of your business.
If you don’t collect money that your customers owe you in a timely fashion,
you might not have enough money to buy the things you need to continue your
business. A cash flow crunch could squeeze you out of business.
From the Collection Manager window, shown in Figure 6, you can monitor
your receivables and even create collection letters to send to your cus-
tomers. Choose Analysis➪Collection Manager to open this window.
The Collection Manager works a lot like the Payment Manager. You can view
the information numerically and change the dates you’re viewing. And, if you
double-click a bar on the chart, you can view details of the invoices that are
past due for that period.
In the Collection Manager window, you can select invoices for which you want
to send collection letters. Click the Letter button at the top of the window, and
you can select a letter format. You can view the text for each letter format,
which range from gentle reminders to firm requests for payment, by clicking
the Design button in the window where you select the letter format.

Peachtree treats collection letters as forms; therefore, you can modify the
various collection letters the same way you modify other forms. You can find
the collection letters by opening the Select a Report window for Accounts
Receivable and looking for a folder called Collection Letters. Also note that
the form letters used in the Collection Manager are not the same ones used
by the Mail Merge function. Unfortunately, there’s no slick way to create a col-
lection letter through the Mail Merge function for customers selected in the
Collection Manager.
See Chapter 13 for more information on customizing forms and Mail Merge.
Looking at Peachtree Today
When you first opened your company in Peachtree, you probably noticed
that a browser page appeared, displaying “Peachtree Today.” You can think of
Peachtree Today as an information center for your company. Unless you
change the preferences for Peachtree Today, each time you open Peachtree,
you see the Welcome page shown in Figure 7. The topics listed down the left
side and in the center of the page work like Web page links; click one to dis-
play information on that topic.
If you close Peachtree Today and want to reopen it, click the Today button,
which appears at the bottom-right corner of the Peachtree window.
On the My Business page, shown in Figure 8, you can find a snapshot of major
items of interest related to sales and receipts, purchases and payables, inven-
tory, and our favorite: general ledger. We like to display the General Ledger
page of Peachtree Today as the default page so that we can keep a close eye
on current period net income and year-to-date balances in accounts we like to
watch, such as bank accounts, Accounts Payable, and Accounts Receivable.
We include our suspense account in this group to make sure that its balance
is always zero. You also can customize this page to display the balances and
budget variances of accounts you select. And you can print certain reports,
such as the General Ledger Trial Balance, directly from this page.
On the Sales & Receipts and Purchases & Payables tabs of the My Business
page, Peachtree displays sales invoices and vendor bills overdue by 10 days
or more as well as a pie chart of your Aged Receivables and Aged Payables.
You also can print the Aged Receivables and Aged Payables reports from
these pages.
8
Peachtree For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

On the Inventory tab of the My Business page, Peachtree displays a Cost of
Sales Trend line graph, the fastest selling inventory items for the current
period. You can also print your Income Statement from this tab. Use the
PeachSync tab to synchronize data if you’re using Web Accounting. (See
Appendix B for more information on add-on products such as Web
Accounting.)
The Daily Register, shown in Figure 9, shows you the total number of transac-
tions and the total dollars of every type of transaction for the current date
and the period-to-date. You can drill down on any number on the page to
view a report of the details that make up the number.
When you click My Resources (in the left column), Peachtree prompts you to
sign onto the Internet unless you have an always-on connection. After you
sign on, if necessary, a page appears that contains news and services of inter-
est to Peachtree users.

Peachtree and Networking
In This Chapter
 Installing Peachtree on a network
 Modifying Peachtree settings
I
f you’re not a geeky type of person who fools around with networking, skip
this chapter. Go to lunch, take a walk, whatever. However, if you’re the one
responsible for keeping Peachtree running across your network, read on. You
may find something in this chapter that you can use.
Peachtree Complete Accounting and Peachtree Premium Accounts are the
only multi-user products. You can’t use Peachtree Accounting or Peachtree
First Accounting in a network environment. Also, to function in a network
environment, you must purchase the multi-user license version of the prod-
uct or purchase a single user copy for each PC on which you want to install
Peachtree. Otherwise, two users can’t access the data files at the same time.
What Type of Network Can Be Used?
The most typical types of networks in use today are peer-to-peer networks
and client/server networks.
A peer-to-peer network environment (such as Windows 98, 2000, or XP) allows
each connected computer to act as a server or a workstation or both. Each
computer can share its hard drive, printers, and other devices with all other
computers in the network. This makes each computer on the network equal
to the other computers, or a peer.
A client/server network environment (such as Windows NT, Windows Server
2003, or Novell) has one computer — the server — acting as a central unit
with several workstations connected to it. The server is where you store the
data shared by the workstations.

This chapter provides general guidelines for installing Peachtree on a net-
work. You can also obtain guidelines providing specific system requirements
for Peachtree to run successfully on various network types. Go to Peachtree’s
Web site at www.peachtree.com and search the Peachtree KnowledgeBase
for networking.
Peachtree Software does not support the use of its products in a Windows
Terminal Server environment. All warranties granted in the Peachtree Software
license agreement are null and void if you install the product in a Windows
Terminal Server environment.
Where Do the Files Reside?
Peachtree divides all its files into two main sets: program files and data files.
Program files do not need to be shared. They need to reside on each individ-
ual machine. Data files must be shared in a networked environment. Data files
include help files, the status.dat file, the options.dat file, the global
taxtable file, and form files, as well as all company folders that include the
data files when you create your Peachtree company.
In a client/server network, data files are stored on the server. In a peer-to-
peer network, which doesn’t have a traditional server, usually the administra-
tor’s machine is designated as the main computer. Ideally, this computer is
the fastest and has the largest amount of available memory and hard drive
disk space.
Installing Peachtree on a Network
Peachtree must be loaded on a computer using administrator rights. Individual
users don’t need administrator rights to use Peachtree after it is loaded on
their computers. They do have to have the rights to modify the data on the
server. Additionally, they need access to the C:\Program Files\Common
Files\Peach folder and to C:\Winnt or C:\Windows.They also need rights to
the registry for Peachtree.
If your server machine is going to run Peachtree, install the program on that
machine first. You can do a standard install on the server machine. Then
install the program files on each workstation, doing a network install.
Before you install on the workstations, however, you must map a drive letter to
the server. (We like to use the letter P for our mapped drive — P for Peachtree,
2
Peachtree For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

get it?) The data location you select must be a shared folder. Because peer-to-
peer networks allow you to share the entire hard drive or only a particular
folder, before you load Peachtree you should know whether you’re sharing the
entire drive or just the Peachtree folder. If you’re planning to share only to a
particular folder, here are a few strategies to keep in mind:
 If you’re planning to map Peachtree workstations to a specific folder,
such as making P: point directly to the \Program Files\Peachtree\
folder, your data path would read: P:\Company\.
 If you are mapping the entire Program Files folder as P: your data path
would read P:\Peachtree\Company\.
 If you map the entire hard drive as P:, the data path would read
P:\Program Files\Peachtree\Company\.
 If you’re performing the Peachtree installation on the server, the pro-
gram path and data path should be the same. However, when installing
on the workstation, the program path should be on a local hard drive
(C:\Program Files\Peachtree\) while the data path should point to
the Company folder on the server computer, for example, P:\Program
Files\Peachtree\Company.
Because Peachtree writes to the Windows registry, you should restart your
system after installation but before you use the application.
If you’re installing to the server, be sure to warn any users who may be using
other applications on the server that you’re going to restart the system.
Just a Few Final Notes
We told you this was really geeky stuff! Here are a few little ditties you might
want to know if you need to make changes to your Peachtree settings.
Data folders
For each company you create in Peachtree, Peachtree creates a folder in
which to store the company information. The folder name comes from the
company name. Generally, Peachtree takes the first three letters of the first
word of the company name, the first three letters of the second word of the
company name, and the first two letters of the third word of the company
name. If your company name contains two or fewer words, Peachtree uses
3
Bonus Chapter 3: Peachtree and Networking

only those words but a total of eight letters if possible. Confused? Here are
some examples:
 If your company name is All Business Service, Peachtree creates a folder
called ALLBUSSE.
 If your company name is Marmel Enterprises, LLC, Peachtree creates a
folder MARENTLL.
 If your company name is Bo the Handyman, Peachtree creates a folder
BOTHEHAN.
 If your company name is Magic Fingers, Peachtree creates a folder
MAGFINGE.
 If your company name is Wanderbusters, Peachtree creates a folder
WANDERBU.
Changing from single- to multi-user
If you first installed Peachtree as a stand-alone program, but now you need to
network it, we suggest that you uninstall Peachtree and then reinstall the pro-
gram. Different settings are used when installing as a single user versus as a
multi-user.
Changing data path
If you simply want to change the data path location, you can edit the
Peachtree INI file. You’ll find the INI file in the Windows (or WINNT) folder.
The file name depends on your version of Peachtree, as follows:
 For Peachtree Complete Accounting R2004, look for a file named
PCW110.INI.
 For Peachtree Complete Accounting R2005, look for a file named
PCW120.INI.
 For Peachtree Premium Accounting R2004, look for a file named
PPA110.INI.
 For Peachtree Premium Accounting R2005, look for a file named
PPA120.INI.
Open the .ini file by double-clicking the file. Then edit the DATAPATH= line.
The DATAPATH line should always be pointing to the drive and Company
folder that contains your company data folder. Your company data folder
itself should not be included in the path.
4
Peachtree For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Even though the data path is, for example, C:\Program Files\Peachtree\
Company, the .ini files that Peachtree still uses can’t handle long file names.
Therefore, the .ini file actually references the eight-character DOS file-
naming convention. In the preceding example, the .ini file would read 
DATAPATH=C:\PROGRA~1\PEACHT~1\Company.
Special hardware and software issues
This section contains suggestions, not requirements, for networking.
However, we have found that Peachtree responds much better if you follow
these guidelines:
 Make sure all workstations are using the same version of Windows. If
you’re using Windows XP, for example, make sure everyone is using
Windows XP.
 Make sure all workstations are using the latest update of their Windows
version.
 Make sure all workstations have the same brand of network card. We’ve
seen a number of instances where replacing the network cards so that
all workstations use the same brand substantially improved Peachtree
performance. We don’t really know why it works better, but it does.
 Make sure the workstations have enough memory. If you’re on a net-
work, chances are your Peachtree data files will be larger than a single
user, simply because you have more people entering data. Peachtree
requires a minimum of 64Mb of memory but we highly recommend at
least 256Mb — and more if you can. More memory means much better
performance.
Peachtree recommends a maximum of five simultaneous users. It won’t stop
you if you have more users, but you will notice a slowdown in performance
and an increase in collision times, especially when multiple users write to the
data files at the same time.

Peachtree Fixed Assets
If your company owns assets with a useful life of more than one year, you own
fixed assets. From an accounting perspective, you treat a fixed asset differently
from another type of asset because you depreciate it over its estimated useful
life to spread out the cost of the asset instead of recognizing its entire cost in
the year that you buy the asset. If you have lots of fixed assets, tracking their
value and associated depreciation can be problematic. Consider trying
Peachtree Fixed Assets, which is available for Peachtree Complete and
Peachtree Premium.

of optional program upgrades — to be able to prepare your payroll data for
electronic transfer from Peachtree to the your bank every payday. The bank

The Accounting Equation —
and How It Works
W
e’re going to start with a little history — after all, debits and credits
didn’t just magically appear. And, with the history lesson, at least you’ll
know who to hate for inventing debits and credits. (We’ve always found that
directing anger correctly is more productive than being angry in general.)
You can trace double-entry bookkeeping back to Luca Pacioli’s book, Summa
de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita (Everything about
Arithmetic, Geometry, and Proportion). Pacioli was a Franciscan friar in Venice,
Italy, and wrote the Summa in 1494. One part of his book described a method
of keeping accounts so that the trader could get, without delay, information
about his assets and liabilities. Pacioli’s interrelating system of accounts was
based on two fundamental principles that are still the foundation of account-
ing today:
 The accounting equation (also called an accounting model): ASSETS =
LIABILITIES + OWNER’S EQUITY
 Debits = credits
Assets are things of value, such as cash, receivables, inventory, equipment,
deposits, and investments that your company owns. These “things of value”
help you operate your business. Liabilities are the debts owed by the com-
pany, such as accounts payable, loans, taxes, and interest. Owner’s Equity
(also called Equity, Capital, and Paid-In Capital) is the owner’s interest in the
company.
To understand how the accounting equation works, we’ll start a fictitious
cash-based business with $1,000 of our own money, giving the company one
asset of cash. To represent our investment into the business, we record the
$1,000 as equity, as you can see from Line 1 in the following table of fictitious
accounting transactions.

Line
Assets
=
Liabilities
+
Owner’s Equity
1
$1,000
=
$1,000

$2,000
4
($1,200)
=
($1,200)
$4,800
=
$3,000
+
$1,800
To run our business, we purchase a delivery truck by borrowing $3,000 from
the bank (it’s a cheap truck), which we record as Line 2 in the table. Combining
this entry with the original investment, we have $4,000 of assets (the initial
cash and the truck), $3,000 of liabilities (the bank loan for the truck), and
$1,000 of equity. Note that the accounting equation balances. That is, assets
equal liabilities plus owner’s equity. The table is looking suspiciously like a
Balance Sheet (now you understand why they call it a “Balance” sheet; see
Chapter 16 for a sample of the Balance Sheet).
Okay, every business has income from sales (or it won’t stay in business very
long) and expenses. Pacioli realized this, too. We’re sure you would agree
that what you earn belongs to you. At least, you should get to keep most of it.
We handle income and expenses in the accounting equation by expanding the
equation to include them in owner’s equity:
Equity = Original investment + Income – Expenses
In our example, the original investment was $1,000. Suppose that we made
$2,000 of cash sales and pay for $1,200 of expenses. What would happen to
our accounting model? Line 3 in the table shows how $2,000 of cash sales
increases our assets (cash) and the income portion of owner’s equity. Line 4
shows that $1,200 of cash expenses decreases our assets (cash) and the
expense portion of owner’s equity.
Income minus expenses is net income, as you may remember on your Income
Statement in Chapter 16 — and the business pays taxes on this amount. And,
when you close the year, Peachtree posts net income after taxes to the equity
section of the Balance Sheet. You can gain numerous insights about your
business by studying your Balance Sheet and Income Statement. Wish we had
space to show you, but . . . think Peachtree Bible. . . .
Now consider Pacioli’s second principle of accounting: Debits = Credits. Pacioli
needed some mechanical device to make sure that the accounting equation
was always in balance. He developed the following four rules — and we find
them most helpful when preparing journal entries:
2
Peachtree For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

 Debits increase Asset accounts and decrease Liability and Equity
accounts.
 Credits do the opposite; they decrease Asset accounts and increase
Liability and Equity accounts.
Expense and Income accounts behave like equity accounts, so
 Debits increase Expense accounts and decrease Income accounts.
 Credits (surprise!) do the opposite; they decrease Expense accounts and
increase Income accounts.
Return to our example to see how these work. In Line 1 of the table, we
started our business by investing $1,000. We increased our assets and
increased our equities. According to Rules 1 and 2, we debited assets and
credited equity.
Line 2 shows how we handled the purchase of our truck. Because both an
asset (purchase of truck) and a liability (borrowed money) increased, we
debited assets and credited liabilities (again, Rules 1 and 2).
In our last transactions (Lines 3 and 4 of the table) we earned $2,000 of
income and paid $1,200 of expenses. Note the following:
 The income increased our cash asset by $2,000 and also increased our
income by the same amount. Therefore, Rules 1 and 4 say we should
debit (increase) the cash asset and credit (increase) income.
 Expense transactions have the opposite effect; therefore, Rules 2 and 3
say we should credit (decrease) the cash asset and debit (increase)
expenses.
These debit/credit rules are necessary to make sure we always keep the
accounting model in balance.
