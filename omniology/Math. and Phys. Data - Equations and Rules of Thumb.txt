This chapter contains data pertaining to sets, functions, arith-
metic, real-number algebra, complex-number algebra, coordi-
nate systems, graphs, and vector algebra.
Sets
A set is a collection or group of deﬁnable unique elements or
members. Set elements commonly include:
 Points on a line
 Instants in time
 Coordinates in a plane
 Coordinates in space
 Coordinates on a display
 Curves on a graph or display
 Physical objects
 Chemical elements
 Digital logic states
 Locations in memory or storage
 Data bits, bytes, or characters
 Subscribers to a network

4
Chapter One
If an element a is contained in a set A, then this fact is written
as:
a  A
Set intersection
The intersection of two sets A and B, written A  B, is the set
C such that the following statement is true for every element
x:
x  C ↔x  A and x  B
Set union
The union of two sets A and B, written A  B, is the set C such
that the following statement is true for every element x:
x  C ↔x  A or x  B
Subsets
A set A is a subset of a set B, written A  B, if and only if the
following holds true:
x  A →x  B
Proper subsets
A set A is a proper subset of a set B, written A  B, if and only
if both the following hold true:
x  A →x  B
A  B
Disjoint sets
Two sets A and B are disjoint if and only if all three of the
following conditions are met:

Algebra, Functions, Graphs, and Vectors
5
A  
B  
A  B  
where  denotes the empty set, also called the null set.
Coincident sets
Two non-empty sets A and B are coincident if and only if, for
all elements x:
x  A ↔x  B
Cardinality
The cardinality of a set is deﬁned as the number of elements in
the set. The null set has cardinality zero. The set of people in
a city, stars in a galaxy, or atoms in the observable universe has
ﬁnite cardinality.
Most commonly used number sets have inﬁnite cardinality.
Some number sets have cardinality that is denumerable; such
a set can be completely deﬁned in terms of a sequence, even
though there might be inﬁnitely many elements in the set.
Some inﬁnite number sets have non-denumerable cardinality;
such a set cannot be completely deﬁned in terms of a sequence.
One-one function
Let A and B be two non-empty sets. Suppose that for every
member of A, a function f assigns some member of B. Let a1
and a2 be members of A. Let b1 and b2 be members of B, such
that f assigns f(a1)  b1 and f(a2)  b2. Then f is a one-one
function if and only if:
a  a →b  b
1
2

2
Onto function
A function f from set A to set B is an onto function if and only
if:
b  B →f(a)  b for some a  A

6
Chapter One
One-to-one correspondence
A function f from set A to set B is a one-to-one correspondence,
also known as a bijection, if and only if f is both one-one and
onto.
Domain and range
Let f be a function from set A to set B. Let A be the set of all
elements a in A for which there is a corresponding element b
in B. Then A is called the domain of f.
Let f be a function from set A to set B. Let B be the set of
all elements b in B for which there is a corresponding element
a in A. Then B is called the range of f.
Continuity
A function f is continuous if and only if, for every point a in the
domain A and for every point b  f(a) in the range B, f(x)
approaches b as x approaches a. If this requirement is not met
for every point a in A, then the function f is discontinuous, and
each point or value ad in A for which the requirement is not
met is called a discontinuity.
Denumerable Number Sets
Numbers are abstract expressions of physical or mathematical
quantity, extent, or magnitude. Mathematicians deﬁne numbers
in terms of set cardinality. Numerals are the written symbols
that are mutually agreed upon to represent numbers.
Natural numbers
The natural numbers, also called the whole numbers or counting
numbers, are built up from a starting point of zero. Zero is de-
ﬁned as the null set . On this basis:
0  
1  {}

The natural numbers can be depicted
as points on a ray.
2  {0, 1}  {,{}}
3  {0, 1, 2}  {,{},{,{}}}
↓
Etc.
The set of natural numbers is denoted N, and is commonly ex-
pressed as:
N  {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n, ...}
In some instances, zero is not included, so the set of natural
numbers is deﬁned as:
N  {1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n, ...}
Natural numbers can be expressed as points along a geometric
ray or half-line, where quantity is directly proportional to dis-
placement (Fig. 1.1).
Decimal numbers
The decimal number system is also called modulo 10, base 10,
or radix 10. Digits are representable by the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9}. The digit immediately to the left of the radix point
is multiplied by 100, or 1. The next digit to the left is multiplied
by 101, or 10. The power of 10 increases as you move further to
the left. The ﬁrst digit to the right of the radix point is multi-
plied by a factor of 101, or 1/10. The next digit to the right is
multiplied by 102, or 1/100. This continues as you go further
to the right. Once the process of multiplying each digit is com-
pleted, the resulting values are added. This is what is repre-
sented when you write a decimal number. For example,
3
2
1
0
2704.53816  2  10  7  10  0  10  4  10
1
2
3
4
5
 5  10
 3  10
 8  10
 1  10
 6  10

Chapter One
Binary numbers
The binary number system is a method of expressing numbers
using only the digits 0 and 1. It is sometimes called base 2, radix
2, or modulo 2. The digit immediately to the left of the radix
point is the ‘‘ones’’ digit. The next digit to the left is a ‘‘twos’’
digit; after that comes the ‘‘fours’’ digit. Moving further to the
left, the digits represent 8, 16, 32, 64, etc., doubling every time.
To the right of the radix point, the value of each digit is cut in
half again and again, that is, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64,
etc.
Consider an example using the decimal number 94:
0
1
94  (4  10 )  (9  10 )
In the binary number system the breakdown is:
0
1
2
1011110  0  2  1  2  1  2
3
4
5
6
 1  2  1  2  0  2  1  2
When you work with a computer or calculator, you give it a
decimal number that is converted into binary form. The com-
puter or calculator does its operations with zeros and ones.
When the process is complete, the machine converts the result
back into decimal form for display.
Octal and hexadecimal numbers
Another numbering scheme is the octal number system, which
has eight symbols, or 23. Every digit is an element of the set
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. Counting thus proceeds from 7 directly to
10, from 77 directly to 100, from 777 directly to 1000, etc.
Yet another scheme, commonly used in computer practice, is
the hexadecimal number system, so named because it has 16
symbols, or 24. These digits are the usual 0 through 9 plus six
more, represented by A through F, the ﬁrst six letters of the
alphabet. The digit set is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D,
E, F}.
Integers
The set of natural numbers can be duplicated and inverted to
form an identical, mirror-image set:

Algebra, Functions, Graphs, and Vectors
9
Figure 1.2
The integers can be depicted as points
on a horizontal line.
N  {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n, ...}
The union of this set with the set of natural numbers produces
the set of integers, commonly denoted Z:
Z  N  N
 {..., n, ..., 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, ..., n, ...}
Integers can be expressed as points along a line, where quantity
is directly proportional to displacement (Fig. 1.2). In the illus-
tration, integers correspond to points where hash marks cross
the line. The set of natural numbers is a proper subset of the
set of integers:
N  Z
For any number a, if a  N, then a  Z. This is formally writ-
ten:
∀a: a  N →a  Z
The converse of this is not true. There are elements of Z
(namely, the negative integers) that are not elements of N.
Operations with integers
Several arithmetic operations are deﬁned for pairs of integers.
The basic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplica-
tion, division, and exponentiation.
Addition is symbolized by a cross or plus sign (). The result
of this operation is a sum. On the number line of Fig. 1.2, sums
are depicted by moving to the right. For example, to illustrate
the fact that 2  5  3, start at the point corresponding to
2, then move to the right 5 units, ending up at the point cor-
responding to 3. In general, to illustrate a  b  c, start at the
point corresponding to a, then move to the right b units, ending
up at the point corresponding to c.

10
Chapter One
Subtraction is symbolized by a dash (). The result of this
operation is a difference. On the number line of Fig. 1.2, differ-
ences are depicted by moving to the left. For example, to illus-
trate the fact that 3  5  2, start at the point corresponding
to 3, then move to the left 5 units, ending up at the point cor-
responding to 2. In general, to illustrate a  b  c, start at
the point corresponding to a, then move to the left b units, end-
ing up at the point corresponding to c.
Multiplication is symbolized by a tilted cross (), a small dot
(), or sometimes in the case of variables, by listing the numbers
one after the other (for example, ab). Occasionally an asterisk
(*) is used. The result of this operation is a product. On the
number line of Fig. 1.2, products are depicted by moving away
from the zero point, or origin, either toward the left or toward
the right depending on the signs of the numbers involved. To
illustrate a  b  c, start at the origin, then move away from
the origin a units b times. If a and b are both positive or both
negative, move toward the right; if a and b have opposite sign,
move toward the left. The ﬁnishing point corresponds to c.
The preceding three operations are closed over the set of
integers. This means that if a and b are integers, then a  b,
a  b, and a  b are integers.
Division, also called the ratio operation, is symbolized by a
forward slash (/) or a dash with dots above and below (). Oc-
casionally it is symbolized by a colon (:). The result of this op-
eration is a quotient or ratio. On the number line of Fig. 1.2,
quotients are depicted by moving in toward the zero point, or
origin, either toward the left or toward the right depending on
the signs of the numbers involved. To illustrate a/b  c, it is
easiest to envision the product b  c  a performed ‘‘back-
wards.’’ But division, unlike addition, subtraction, or multipli-
cation, is not closed over the set of integers. If a and b are in-
tegers, then a/b might be an integer, but this is not necessarily
the case. The ratio operation gives rise to a more inclusive, but
still denumerable, set of numbers. The quotient a/b is not de-
ﬁned if b  0.
Exponentiation, also called raising to a power, is symbolized
by a superscript numeral. The result of this operation is known
as a power. If a is an integer and b is a positive integer, then
ab is the result of multiplying a by itself b times.

Rational numbers
A rational number (the term derives from the word ratio) is a
quotient of two integers, where the denominator is positive. The
standard form for a rational number r is:
r  a/b
Any such quotient is a rational number. The set of all possible
such quotients encompasses the entire set of rational numbers,
denoted Q. Thus,
Q  {xx  a/b}
where a  Z, b  Z, and b  0. The set of integers is a proper
subset of the set of rational numbers. Thus natural numbers,
integers, and rational numbers have the following relationship:
N  Z  Q
Decimal expansions
Rational numbers can be denoted in decimal form as an integer
followed by a period (radix point) followed by a sequence of
digits. (See Decimal numbers above for more details concern-
ing this notation.) The digits following the radix point always
exist in either of two forms:
 A ﬁnite string of digits beyond which all digits are zero
 An inﬁnite string of digits that repeat in cycles
Examples of the ﬁrst type of rational number, known as termi-
nating decimals, are:
3/4  0.750000 ...
9/8   1.1250000 ...
Examples of the second type of rational number, known as non-
terminating, repeating decimals, are:
1/3  0.33333 ...
123/999  0.123123123 ...

12
Chapter One
Non-denumerable Number Sets
The elements of non-denumerable number sets cannot be listed.
In fact, it is impossible to even deﬁne the elements of such a
set by writing down a list or sequence.
Irrational numbers
An irrational number is a number that cannot be expressed as
the ratio of two integers. Examples of irrational numbers in-
clude:
 The length of the diagonal of a square that is one unit on
each edge
 The circumference-to-diameter ratio of a circle
All irrational numbers share the property of being inexpressible
in decimal form. When an attempt is made to express such a
number in this form, the result is a nonterminating, nonrepeat-
ing decimal. No matter how many digits are speciﬁed to the
right of the radix point, the expression is only an approximation
of the actual value of the number. The set of irrational numbers
can be denoted S. This set is entirely disjoint from the set of
rational numbers:
S  Q  
Real numbers
The set of real numbers, denoted R, is the union of the sets of
rational and irrational numbers:
R  Q  S
For practical purposes, R can be depicted as the set of points
on a continuous geometric line, as shown in Fig. 1.2. In theo-
retical mathematics, the assertion that the points on a geomet-
ric line correspond one-to-one with the real numbers is known
as the Continuum Hypothesis. The real numbers are related to
rational numbers, integers, and natural numbers as follows:
N  Z  Q  R
The operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,

Algebra, Functions, Graphs, and Vectors
13
and exponentiation can be deﬁned over the set of real numbers.
If # represents any one of these operations and x and y are
elements of R with y  0, then:
x # y  R
The symbol ℵ0 (aleph-null or aleph-nought) denotes the car-
dinality of the sets of natural numbers, integers, and rational
numbers. The cardinality of the real numbers is denoted ℵ1
(aleph-one). These ‘‘numbers’’ are called inﬁnite cardinals or
transﬁnite cardinals. Around the year 1900, the German math-
ematician Georg Cantor proved that these two ‘‘numbers’’ are
not the same:
ℵ ℵ
1
0
This reﬂects the fact that the elements of N can be paired off
one-to-one with the elements of Z or Q, but not with the ele-
ments of S or R. Any attempt to pair off the elements of N and
S or N and R results in some elements of S or R being left over
without corresponding elements in N.
Imaginary numbers
The set of real numbers, and the operations deﬁned above for
the integers, give rise to some expressions that do not behave
as real numbers. The best known example is the number i such
that i  i  1. No real number satisﬁes this equation. This
entity i is known as the unit imaginary number. Sometimes it
is denoted j. If i is used to represent the unit imaginary number
common in mathematics, then the real number x is written be-
fore i. Examples: 3i, 5i, 2.787i. If j is used to represent the
unit imaginary number common in engineering, then x is writ-
ten after j if x  0, and x is written after j if x  0. Examples:
j3, j5, j2.787.
The set J of all real-number multiples of i or j is the set of
imaginary numbers:
J  {kk  jx}  {kk  xi}
For practical purposes, the set J can be depicted along a number
line corresponding one-to-one with the real number line. How-
ever, by convention, the imaginary number line is oriented ver-

tically (Fig. 1.3). The sets of imaginary and real numbers have
one element in common. That element is zero:
0i  j0  0
J  R  {0}
Complex numbers
A complex number consists of the sum of two separate compo-
nents, a real number and an imaginary number. The general
form for a complex number c is:
c  a  bi  a  jb
The set of complex numbers is denoted C. Individual complex
numbers can be depicted as points on a coordinate plane as
shown in Fig. 1.4. According to the Continuum Hypothesis, the
points on the so-called complex-number plane exist in a one-to-
one correspondence with the elements of C.
The set of imaginary numbers, J, is a proper subset of C. The
set of real numbers, R, is also a proper subset of C. Formally:
J  C
N  Z  Q  R  C

Equality of complex numbers
Let x1 and x2 be complex numbers such that:
x  a  jb

x  a  jb

Then the two complex numbers are said to be equal if and only
if their real and imaginary components are both equal:

Operations with complex numbers
The operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
and exponentiation are deﬁned for the set of complex numbers
as follows.

16
Chapter One
Complex addition: The real and imaginary parts are summed
independently. The general formula for the sum of two complex
numbers is:
(a  jb)  (c  jd)  (a  c)  j(b  d)
Complex subtraction: The second complex number is multi-
plied by 1, and then the resulting two numbers are summed.
The general formula for the difference of two complex numbers
is:
(a  jb)  (c  jd)  (a  jb)  (1(c  jd))
 (a  c)  j(b  d)
Complex multiplication: The product of two complex numbers
consists of a sum of four individual products. The general for-
mula for the product of two complex numbers is:
2
(a  jb)(c  jd)  ac  jad  jbc  j bd
 (ac  bd)  j(ad  bc)
Complex division: This formula can be derived from the for-
mula for complex multiplication. The general formula for the
quotient of two complex numbers is:
(a  jb)/(c  jd)
2

2
 (ac  bd)/(c  d )  j(bc  ad)/(c  d )
The above formula assumes that the denominator is not zero.
For complex division to be deﬁned, the following must hold:
c  jd  0  j0
Complex exponentiation to a positive integer: This is symbol-
ized by a superscript numeral. The result of this operation is
known as a power. If a  jb is an integer and c is a positive
integer, then (a  jb)c is the result of multiplying (a  jb) by
itself c times.

Complex vectors
Complex numbers can be represented as vectors in rectangular
coordinates. This gives each complex number a unique magni-
tude and direction. The magnitude is the distance of the point
a  jb from the origin 0  j0. The direction is the angle of the
vector, measured counterclockwise from the a axis. This is
shown in Fig. 1.5.
The absolute value or magnitude of a complex number a  jb,
written a  jb, is the length of its vector in the complex plane,
measured from the origin (0,0) to the point (a,b). In the case of
a pure real number a  j0:
a  j0  a if a  0
a  j0  a if a  0
In the case of a pure imaginary number 0  jb:
0  jb  b if b  0
0  jb  b if b  0
If a complex number is neither pure real nor pure imaginary,
the absolute value is the length of the vector as shown in Fig.
1.6. The general formula is:

Polar form of complex numbers
Consider the polar plane deﬁned in terms of radius r and angle
 counterclockwise from the a axis as shown in Fig. 1.7. The
expression for a Cartesian vector (a,b), representing the com-

these conversions:

The expression for a polar vector (r,) in Cartesian coordinates
(a,b) is obtained by these conversions:
a  r cos 

called the modulus. The angle , corresponding to the direction

Properties of Operations
Several properties, also called laws, are recognized as valid for
the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and di-
vision for all real, imaginary, and complex numbers.
Additive identity
When 0 is added to any real number a, the sum is always equal
to a. When 0  j0 is added to any complex number a  jb, the
sum is always equal to a  jb. The numbers 0 and 0  j0 are
additive identity elements:
a  0  a
(a  jb)  (0  j0)  a  jb
Multiplicative identity
When any real number a is multiplied by 1, the product is al-
ways equal to a. When any complex number a  jb is multiplied
by 1  j0, the product is always equal to a  jb. The numbers
1 and 1  j0 are multiplicative identity elements:
a  1  a
(a  jb)  (1  j0)  a  jb
Additive inverse
For every real number a, there exists a unique real number a
such that the sum of the two is equal to 0. For every complex
number a  jb, there exists a unique complex number a  jb
such that the sum of the two is equal to 0  j0. Formally:
a  (a)  0
(a  jb)  (a  jb)  0  j0
Multiplicative inverse
For every nonzero real number a, there exists a unique real
number 1/a such that the product of the two is equal to 1. For

22
Chapter One
every complex number a  jb except 0  j0, there exists a
unique complex number a/(a2  b2)  jb/(a2  b2) such that the
product of the two is equal to 1  j0. Formally:

(a  jb)  (a/(a  b )  jb/(a  b ))  1  j0
Commutativity of addition
When summing any two real or complex numbers, it does not
matter in which order the sum is performed. For all real num-
bers a and b, and for all complex numbers a  jb and c  jd,
the following equations hold:
a  b  b  a
(a  jb)  (c  jd)  (c  jd)  (a  jb)
Commutativity of multiplication
When multiplying any two real or complex numbers, it does
not matter in which order the product is performed. For all
real numbers a and b, and for all complex numbers a  jb and
c  jd, the following equations hold:
ab  ba
(a  jb)(c  jd)  (c  jd)(a  jb)
Associativity of addition
When adding any three real or complex numbers, it does not
matter how the addends are grouped. For all real numbers a1,
a2, and a3, and for all complex numbers a1  jb1, a2  jb2, and

into a form where the expression on the left-hand side of the
equality symbol is exactly equal to the variable being sought
(for example, x), and a deﬁned expression not containing that
variable is on the right.

Elementary rules
There are several ways in which an equation in one variable
can be manipulated to obtain a solution, assuming a solution
exists. Any and all of the aforementioned principles can be ap-
plied toward this result. In addition, the following rules can be
applied in any order, and any number of times.
Addition of a quantity to each side: Any deﬁned constant,
variable, or expression can be added to both sides of an equa-
tion, and the result is equivalent to the original equation.
Subtraction of a quantity from each side: Any deﬁned con-
stant, variable, or expression can be subtracted from both sides
of an equation, and the result is equivalent to the original equa-
tion.
Multiplication of each side by a quantity: Both sides of an
equation can be multiplied by a deﬁned constant, variable, or
expression, and the result is equivalent to the original equation.
Division of each side by a quantity: Both sides of an equation
can be divided by a nonzero constant, by a variable that cannot
attain a value of zero, or by an expression that cannot attain a
value of zero over the range of its variable(s), and the result is
equivalent to the original equation.
Basic equation in one variable
Consider an equation of the following form:
ax  b  cx  d
where a, b, c, and d are complex numbers, and a  c. This
equation is solved as follows:
ax  b  cx  d
ax  cx  d  b
ax  cx  d  b
(a  c)x  d  b
x  (d  b)/(a  c)

where a1, a2, a3, ..., an are complex numbers. Then the solutions

Quadratic formula
Consider a quadratic equation in standard form:
2
ax  bx  c  0
where a, b, and c are complex numbers, with a  0  j0. The
solutions of this equation can be found according to the follow-
ing formula:
2
1/2
x  (b  (b  4ac)
)/2a
Discriminant
Consider a quadratic equation in standard form:
2
ax  bx  c  0
where a, b, and c are real numbers. Deﬁne the discriminant, d,
as follows:
2
d  b  4ac
Let the solutions to the quadratic equation be denoted as fol-
lows:

These three principles are often stated as follows:
 If d  0, then there are two distinct real-number solutions.
 If d  0, then there is a single real-number solution.
 If d  0, then there are two complex-conjugate solutions.
Simultaneous Equations
A linear equation in n variables takes the following form:

where x1 through xn represent the variables, and a0 through an
represent constants, usually real numbers.
Existence of solutions
Suppose there exists a set of m linear equations in n variables.
If m  n, there exists no unique solution to the set of equations.
If m  n or m  n, there might exist a unique solution, but not
necessarily. When solving sets of linear equations, it is ﬁrst nec-
essary to see if the number of equations is greater than or equal
to the number of variables. If this is the case, any of the follow-
ing methods can be used in an attempt to ﬁnd a solution. If
there exists no unique solution, this fact will become apparent
as the steps are carried out.
22 substitution method
Consider the following set of two linear equations in two vari-
ables:

a x  b y  c  0

where a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, and c2 are real-number constants, and
the variables are represented by x and y. The substitution
method of solving these equations consists in performing either
of the following sequences of steps. If a1  0, use Sequence A.
If a1  0, use Sequence B. (If both a1  0 and a2  0, the set
of equations is in fact a pair of equations in terms of a single
variable, and the following steps are irrelevant.)
Sequence A: First, solve the ﬁrst equation for x in terms of y:
a x  b y  c  0
1
1
1
a x  b y  c
1
1

x  (b y  c )/a

Next, substitute the above-derived solution for x in place of x in
the second equation, obtaining:
a (b y  c )/a  b y  c  0
2

2
Solve this single-variable equation for y, using the previously
outlined rules for solving single-variable equations. Assuming
a solution exists, it can be substituted for y in either of the
original equations, deriving a single-variable equation in terms
of x. Solve for x, using the previously outlined rules for solving
single-variable equations.
Sequence B: Because a1  0, the ﬁrst equation has only one
variable, and is in the following form:
b y  c  0
1
1
Solve this equation for y:
b y  c

y  c /b

This can be substituted for y in the second equation, obtaining:

a x  b y  c  0
2
2

where a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, and c2 are real-number constants, and
the variables are represented by x and y. The addition method
of solving these equations consists in performing two separate
and independent steps:
 Multiply one or both equations through by constant values to
cancel out the coefﬁcients of x, and then solve for y.
 Multiply one or both equations through by constant values to
cancel out the coefﬁcients of y, and then solve for x.
The scheme for solving for y begins by multiplying the ﬁrst
equation through by a2, and the second equation through by
a1, and then adding the two resulting equations:
a a x  a b y  a c  0
2

Next, add a2c1 to each side, obtaining:

Next, subtract a1c2 from each side, obtaining:

Finally, divide through by a1b2  a2b1, obtaining:

For this to be valid, the denominator must be nonzero; that is,
a1b2  a2b1. (If it turns out that a1b2  a2b1, then there are not
two distinct solutions to the set of equations.)
The process of solving for x is similar. Consider again the orig-
inal set of simultaneous linear equations:

Next, subtract b1c2 from each side, obtaining:

Finally, divide through by b2c1  b1c2, obtaining:
x  (b c  b c )/(a b  a b )

For this to be valid, the denominator must be nonzero; that is,
a1b2  a2b1. (If it turns out that a1b2  a2b1, then there are not
two distinct solutions to the set of equations.)
Solving nn sets of linear equations
In general, matrices are used for solving sets of equations larger
than 22, because the above mentioned methods become too
complex. Linear algebra, also known as matrix algebra, uses
rules similar to those of the addition method described above.
Please consult college-level texts on linear algebra for details.

Chapter One
Solving 22 general equations
When one or both of the equations in a 22 set are nonlinear,
the substitution method generally works best. Two examples
follow.
Example A. Consider the following two equations:
2
y  x  2x  1
y  x  1
The ﬁrst equation is quadratic, and the second equation is lin-
ear. Either equation can be directly substituted into the other
to solve for x. Substituting the second equation into the ﬁrst
yields this result.
2
x  1  x  2x  1
This equation can be put into standard quadratic form as fol-
lows:
2
x  1  x  2x  1
2
x  x  2x
2
0  x  3x
2
x  3x  0  0
Using the quadratic formula, let a  1, b  3, and c  0:
2
1/2
x  (3  (3  4  1  0)
)/(2  1)
1/2
x  (3  (9  0)
)/2
x  (3  3)/2
x  3 and x  0
1
2
These values can be substituted into the original linear equa-
tion to obtain the y-values:
y  3  1 and y  0  1
1
2
y  4 and y  1

2
The solutions are therefore:

2
2
Example B. Consider the following two equations:
2
y  2x  4x  5
y  2x  5
The ﬁrst equation is quadratic, and the second equation is
linear. Either equation can be directly substituted into the other
to solve for x. Substituting the second equation into the ﬁrst
yields this result.
2
2x  5  2x  4x  5
This equation can be put into standard quadratic form as fol-
lows:
2
2x  5  2x  4x  5
2
2x  2x  4x
2
0  2x  6x
2
2x  6x  0  0
Using the quadratic formula, let a  2, b  6, and c  0:
2
1/2
x  (6  (6  4  2  0)
)/(2  2)
1/2
x  (6  (36  0)
)/4
x  (6  6)/4
x  3 and x  0
1
2
These values can be substituted into the original linear
equation to obtain the y-values:
y  2  3  5 and y  2  0  5
1
2
y  11 and y  5

The solutions are therefore:

The Cartesian Plane
The most common two-dimensional coordinate system is the
Cartesian plane (Fig. 1.8), also called rectangular coordinates or
the xy-plane. The independent variable is plotted along the x
axis or abscissa; the dependent variable is plotted along the y
axis or ordinate. The scales of the abscissa and ordinate are
normally linear, although the divisions need not represent the
same increments. Variations of this scheme include the semilog
graph, in which one scale is linear and the other scale is loga-
rithmic, and the log-log graph, in which both scales are loga-
rithmic.
Slope-intercept form of linear equation
A linear equation in two variables can be rearranged from stan-
dard form to a conveniently graphable form as follows:

Algebra, Functions, Graphs, and Vectors
45
ax  by  c  0
ax  by  c
by  ax  c
y  (a/b)x  (c/b)
where a, b, and c are real-number constants, and b  0. Such
an equation appears as a straight line when graphed on the
Cartesian plane. Let x represent a small change in the value
of x on such a graph; let y represent the change in the value
of y that results from this change in x. The ratio y/x is deﬁned
as the slope of the line, and is commonly symbolized m. Let k
represent the y-value of the point where the line crosses the
ordinate. Then the following equations hold:
m  a/b
k  c/b
Thus, the linear equation can be rewritten in slope-intercept
form as:
y  mx  k
To plot a graph of a linear equation in Cartesian coordinates,
proceed as follows:
 Convert the equation to slope-intercept form.
 Plot the point y  k and x  0.
 Move to the right by n units on the graph.
 Move upward by mn units (or downward by mn units).
 Plot the resulting point y  mn  k.
 Connect the two points with a straight line.
Figures 1.9 and 1.10 illustrate the following linear equations as
graphed in slope-intercept form:
y  5x  3
y  x  2
Note that a positive slope indicates that the graph ‘‘ramps up-

ward’’ and a negative slope indicates that the graph ‘‘ramps
downward’’ as the point moves toward the right. A zero slope
indicates a horizontal line. The slope of a vertical line is unde-
ﬁned.
Point-slope form of linear equation
It is not always convenient to plot a graph of a line based on
the y-intercept point because the relevant part of the graph
might lie at a great distance from that point. In this situation,
the point-slope form of a linear equation can be used. This form
is based on the slope m of the line and the coordinates of a
known point (x0,y0):
y  y  m(x  x )
0
0
To plot a graph of a linear equation using the point-slope
method, proceed as follows:
 Convert the equation to point-slope form
 Determine a point (x0,y0) by ‘‘plugging in’’ values
 Plot (x0,y0) on the plane
 Move to the right by n units on the graph
 Move upward by mn units (or downward my mn units)
 Plot the resulting point (x1,y1)
 Connect the points (x0,y0) and (x1,y1) with a straight line
Figures 1.11 and 1.12 illustrate the following linear equations
as graphed in point-slope form for regions in the immediate vi-
cinity of points far removed from the origin:
y  104  3(x  72)
y  55  2(x  85)
Finding linear equation based on graph
Suppose the rectangular coordinates of two points P and Q are
known; suppose further that these two points lie along a
straight line (but not a vertical line). Let the coordinates of the
points be:

Equation of parabola
The Cartesian-coordinate graph of a quadratic equation takes
the form of a parabola. Suppose the following equation is given:
2
y  ax  bx  c
where a  0. (If a  0, then the equation is linear, not quad-
ratic.) To plot a graph of the above equation, ﬁrst determine the
coordinates of the point (x0,y0) where:
x  b/(2a)
0
2
y  c  b /(4a)
0
This point represents the base point of the parabola; that is, the
point at which the curvature is sharpest, and at which the slope
of a line tangent to the curve is zero. Once this point is known,
ﬁnd four more points by ‘‘plugging in’’ values of x somewhat
greater than and less than x0 and determining the correspond-

50

ing y-values. These x-values, call them x2, x1, x1, and x2,
should be equally spaced on either side of x0, such that:

This will yield ﬁve points that lie along the parabola, and that
are symmetrical relative to the axis of the curve. The graph can
then be inferred, provided that the points are judiciously cho-
sen. Some trial and error might be required. If a  0, the pa-
rabola will open upward. If a  0, the parabola will open down-
ward.

where (x0,y0) represents the coordinates of the center of the cir-

Such a circle intersects the x axis at the points (r,0) and (r,0);

where (x0,y0) represents the coordinates of the center of the el-
lipse, a represents the distance from (x0,y0) to the curve as mea-
sured parallel to the x axis, and b represents the distance from
(x0,y0) to the curve as measured parallel to the y axis. This is
illustrated in Fig. 1.16. The values 2a and 2b represent the
lengths of the axes of the ellipse; the greater value is the length
of the major axis, and the lesser value is the length of the minor

whose vertical edges are tangent to the hyperbola, and whose
vertices (corners) lie on the asymptotes of the hyperbola (Fig.
1.17). Then a represents the distance from (x0,y0) to D as mea-
sured parallel to the x axis, and b represents the distance from
(x0,y0) to D as measured parallel to the y axis. The values 2a
and 2b represent the lengths of the axes of the hyperbola; the
greater value is the length of the major axis, and the lesser

The Polar Plane
The polar coordinate plane is an alternative way of expressing
the positions of points, and of graphing equations and relations,
in two dimensions. The independent variable is plotted as the
distance or radius r from the origin, and the dependent variable
is plotted as an angle  relative to a reference axis. Figure 1.20
shows the polar system generally used in mathematics, physical
science, and engineering;  is in radians and is plotted counter-

Other Coordinate Systems
The following paragraphs describe other coordinate systems
that are used in scientiﬁc and engineering applications.
Latitude and longitude
Latitude and longitude angles uniquely deﬁne the positions of
points on the surface of a sphere or in the sky. The scheme for
geographic locations on the earth is illustrated in Fig. 1.31A.
The polar axis connects two speciﬁed points at antipodes on the
sphere. These points are assigned latitude   90 (north pole)
and   90 (south pole). The equatorial axis runs outward

It is assigned longitude 	  0. Latitude  is measured posi-
tively (north) and negatively (south) relative to the plane of the
equator. Longitude 	 is measured counterclockwise (east) and
clockwise (west) relative to the equatorial axis. The angles are
restricted as follows:
90    90
180  	  180
On the earth’s surface, the half-circle connecting the 0 longi-
tude line with the poles passes through Greenwich, England
and is known as the Greenwich meridian or the prime meridian.
Longitude angles are deﬁned with respect to this meridian.
Celestial coordinates
Celestial latitude and celestial longitude are extensions of the
earth’s latitude and longitude into the heavens. Figure 1.31A,

the same set of coordinates used for geographic latitude and
longitude, applies to this system. An object whose celestial lat-
itude and longitude coordinates are (,	) appears at the zenith
in the sky from the point on the earth’s surface whose latitude
and longitude coordinates are (,	).
Declination and right ascension deﬁne the positions of objects
in the sky relative to the stars. Figure 1.31B applies to this
system. Declination () is identical to celestial latitude. Right
ascension (	) is measured eastward from the vernal equinox
(the position of the sun in the heavens at the moment spring
begins in the northern hemisphere). The angles are restricted
as follows:
90    90

Cartesian three-space
An extension of rectangular coordinates into three dimensions
is Cartesian three-space (Fig. 1.32), also called xyz-space. Inde-
pendent variables are usually plotted along the x and y axes;
the dependent variable is plotted along the z axis. The scales
are normally linear, although the divisions need not represent
the same increments. Variations of this scheme can employ log-
arithmic graduations for one, two, or all three scales.
Cylindrical coordinates
Figure 1.33 shows a system of cylindrical coordinates for spec-
ifying the positions of points in three-space. Given a set of Car-
tesian coordinates or xyz-space, an angle 	 is deﬁned in the xy-
plane, measured in radians counterclockwise from the x axis.

Given a point P in space, consider its projection P onto the xy-
plane. The position of P is deﬁned by the ordered triple (	,r,z)
such that:
	  angle between P and the x axis in the xy-plane
r  distance (radius) from P to the origin
z  distance (altitude) of P above the xy-plane
Spherical coordinates
Figure 1.34 shows a system of spherical coordinates for deﬁning
points in space. This scheme is identical to the system for dec-
lination and right ascension, with the addition of a radius vector
r representing the distance of point P from the origin. The lo-
cation of a point P is deﬁned by the ordered triple (,	,r) such
that:

In this example, angles are speciﬁed in degrees; alternatively
they can be expressed in radians. There are several variations
of this system, all of which are commonly called spherical co-
ordinates.
Semilog (x-linear) coordinates
Figure 1.35 shows semilogarithmic (semilog) coordinates for de-
ﬁning points in a portion of the xy-plane. The independent-
variable axis is linear, and the dependent-variable axis is log-
arithmic. The numerical values that can be depicted on the y

In this example, functions can be plotted with domains and
ranges as follows:
1  x  1
0.1  y  10
The y axis in Fig. 1.35 spans two orders of magnitude (powers
of 10). The span could be larger or smaller than this, but in any
case the y values cannot extend to zero. In the example shown
here, only portions of the ﬁrst and second quadrants of the xy-
plane can be depicted. If the y axis were inverted (its values
made negative), the resulting plane would cover corresponding
parts of the third and fourth quadrants.
Semilog (y-linear) coordinates

functions can be plotted with domains and ranges as follows:

The x axis in Fig. 1.36 spans two orders of magnitude (powers

portions of the ﬁrst and fourth quadrants of the xy-plane can be
depicted. If the x axis were inverted (its values made negative),
the resulting plane would cover corresponding parts of the sec-
ond and third quadrants.
Log-log coordinates

one sign or the other, positive or negative. In this example, func-
tions can be plotted with domains and ranges as follows:
0.1  x  10
0.1  y  10
The axes in Fig. 1.37 span two orders of magnitude (powers of
10). The span of either axis could be larger or smaller, but in
any case the values cannot extend to zero. In the example
shown here, only a portion of the ﬁrst quadrant of the xy-plane
can be depicted. By inverting the signs of one or both axes, cor-
responding portions of any of the other three quadrants can be
covered.

the axes are halfway between the origin and the negative outer
ends, which are labeled 	. Succeeding integer points are
placed halfway between previous integers (next closest to zero)
and the outer ends. The result of this scheme is that the entire
coordinate xy-plane is depicted within a ﬁnite open square.
The domain and/or range scales of this coordinate system can
be expanded or compressed by multiplying all the values on
either axis or both axes by a constant. This allows various re-
lations and functions to be plotted, minimizing distortion in par-
ticular regions of interest. Distortion relative to the Cartesian
(conventional rectangular) xy-plane is greatest near the periph-
ery, and is least near the origin.

The radial scale of this coordinate system can be expanded or

tortion relative to the conventional polar coordinate plane is
greatest near the periphery, and is least near the origin.
Vector Algebra
A vector is a mathematical expression for a quantity exhibiting
two independently variable properties: magnitude and direc-
tion.
Vectors in the xy-plane
In the xy-plane, vectors a and b can be denoted as rays from
the origin (0,0) to points (xa,ya) and (xb,yb) as shown in Fig. 1.40.

a • b  x x  y y
a b

The cross product, also known as the vector product and writ-
ten a  b, of vectors a and b is a vector perpendicular to the
plane containing a and b. Let  be the angle between vectors a
and b, as measured in the plane containing them both. The
magnitude of a  b is given by the formula:
a  b  a b sin 
If the direction angle b is greater than the direction angle a
(as shown in Fig. 1.40), then a  b points toward the observer.
If b  a, then a  b points away from the observer.
Vectors in the Polar Plane
In the polar coordinate plane, vectors a and b can be denoted
as rays from the origin (0,0) to points (ra,a) and (rb,b) as shown
in Fig. 1.41.

The sum of a and b is best found by converting into

If b  a (as is the case in Fig. 1.41), then a  b points toward

Vectors in xyz-space
In rectangular xyz-space, vectors a and b can be denoted as rays
from the origin (0,0,0) to points (xa,ya,za) and (xb,yb,zb) as shown

The direction of a is denoted by measuring the angles x, y,

and z axes respectively (Fig. 1.43). These angles, expressed in
radians as an ordered triple (x,y,z), are the direction angles
of a. Often the cosines of these angles are speciﬁed. These are
the direction cosines of a:

The cross product a  b of vectors a and b in xyz-space is a

ab
where ab is the smaller angle between a and b as measured in
P. Vector a  b is perpendicular to P. If a and b are observed
from some point on a line perpendicular to P and intersecting
P at the origin, and ab is expressed counterclockwise from a to
b, then a  b points toward the observer. If a and b are ob-
served from some point on a line perpendicular to P and inter-
secting P at the origin, and ab is expressed clockwise from a to
b, then a  b points away from the observer.
Standard and nonstandard form
In most discussions, vectors are expressed as rays whose origins
coincide with the origins of the coordinate systems in which
they are denoted. This is the standard form of a vector. In stan-
dard form, a vector can be depicted as an ordered set of coor-
dinates such as (x,y,z)  (3,5,5) or (r,)  (10,/4). In rectan-
gular coordinates, the origin of a vector does not have to coincide

they are identical, because they have the same magnitude and
the same direction, even though their end points differ (Fig.
1.45).
Equality of vectors
Two vectors a and b are equal (written a  b) if and only if
they have the same magnitude and direction. The end points of
the vectors need not coincide, unless both vectors are denoted
in standard form.

suppose the end points of vector a are (xa1,ya1) and (xa2,ya2). Sup-
pose the end points of vector b are (xb1,yb1) and (xb2,yb2). Further

Multiplication of vector by scalar
When any vector is multiplied by a real-number scalar, the vec-
tor magnitude (length) is multiplied by that scalar. The direc-
tion (angle or angles) remain(s) unchanged if the scalar is pos-
itive, but is exactly reversed if the scalar is negative. The
following rules apply to vectors in standard form.
In the xy-plane. In two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, let
vector a be deﬁned by the coordinates (x,y) as shown in Fig.
1.46. Suppose a is multiplied by a positive real scalar k. Then
the following equation holds:
ka  k(x,y)  (kx,ky)
If a is multiplied by a negative real scalar k, then:

In the polar plane. In two-dimensional polar coordinates, let
vector a be deﬁned by the coordinates (r,) as shown in Fig.
1.47. Suppose a is multiplied by a positive real scalar k. Then
the following equation holds:
ka  (kr,)
If a is multiplied by a negative real scalar k, then:
ka  (kr, )
The addition of  (180 angular degrees) to  reverses the direc-
tion of a. The same effect can be accomplished by adding or
subtracting any odd integer multiple of .
In xyz-space. In three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, let
vector a be deﬁned by the coordinates (x,y,z) as shown in Fig.
1.48. Suppose a is multiplied by a positive real scalar k. Then
the following equation holds:
ka  k(x,y,z)  (kx,ky,kz)
If a is multiplied by a negative real scalar k, then:

Suppose the direction angles of a are represented by (x,y,z).
Then the direction angles of ka are also given by (x,y,z). The
direction angles of ka are all increased by  (180 angular de-
grees), so they are represented by ((x  ),(y  ),(z  )).
The same effect can be accomplished by adding or subtracting
any odd integer multiple of  to each of these direction angles.
Commutativity of vector addition
When summing any two vectors, it does not matter in which
order the sum is performed. If a and b are vectors, then:
a  b  b  a
In the xy-plane. In two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, let
vector a be deﬁned by the coordinates (xa,ya), and let vector b
be deﬁned by the coordinates (xb,yb). The commutativity of vec-
tor addition follows directly from the commutativity of the ad-
dition of real numbers:
a  b  (x ,y )  (x ,y )

In the polar plane. The sum of a and b is best found by
converting into rectangular (xy-plane) coordinates, adding the
vectors according to the formula for the xy-plane, and then con-
verting the resultant back to polar coordinates.
In xyz-space. In three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, let
vector a be deﬁned by the coordinates (xa,ya,za), and let vector
b be deﬁned by the coordinates (xb,yb,zb). The commutativity of
vector addition follows directly from the commutativity of the
addition of real numbers:

Commutativity of vector-scalar
multiplication
When a vector is multiplied by a scalar, it does not matter in
which order the product is performed. If a is a vector and k is
a real number, then:
ka  ak
In the xy-plane. In two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, let
vector a be deﬁned by the coordinates (x,y). Let k be any real
number. The commutativity of vector-scalar multiplication fol-
lows directly from the commutativity of the multiplication of
real numbers:
ka  k(x,y)  (kx,ky)
and
ak  (x,y)k  (xk,yk)  (kx,ky)
In the polar plane. In two-dimensional polar coordinates, let
vector a be deﬁned by the coordinates (r,). Let k be a real num-
ber. If k  0, then:
ka  k(r,)  (kr,)
and
ak  (r,)k  (rk,)  (kr,)
If k  0, then:

and
ak  (r,)0  (r0,)  (0,)  zero vector
Let k be a negative real; that is, suppose that k  0. Then:
ka  k(r,)  (kr, )
and
a(k)  (r,)(k)  (r(k),  )  (kr, )
In xyz-space. In three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, let
vector a be deﬁned by the coordinates (x,y,z). Let k be any real
number. The commutativity of vector-scalar multiplication fol-
lows directly from the commutativity of the multiplication of
real numbers:
ka  k(x,y,z)  (kx,ky,kz)
and
ak  (x,y,z)k  (xk,yk,zk)  (kx,ky,kz)
Commutativity of dot product
When the dot product of two vectors is found, it does not matter
in which order the vectors are placed. If a and b are vectors,
then:
a • b  b • a
In the xy-plane. In two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, let
vector a be deﬁned by the coordinates (xa,ya), and let vector b
be deﬁned by the coordinates (xb,yb). The commutativity of the
dot product follows directly from the commutativity of the mul-
tiplication of real numbers:
a • b  x x  y y

Negative commutativity of cross
product
Let  be the angle between two vectors a and b as measured in
the plane containing a and b. Suppose that  is measured by
rotating from a to b, in the direction such that the angle tra-
versed is less than or equal to  radians. The magnitude of the

The vector b  a has the same magnitude as vector a 
b, but points in the opposite direction.
cross-product vector is independent of the order in which the
cross product is performed. This can be derived from the com-
mutativity of the multiplication of scalars:
a  b  a b sin 
and
b  a  b a sin   a b sin 
The direction of b  a is opposite that of a  b. The sense of
these vectors, and their relationship with a and b, is shown in
the example of Fig. 1.49. From this, it follows that:
b  a  (1)(a  b)  (a  b)
Associativity of vector addition
When summing any three vectors, it makes no difference how
the sum is grouped. If a, b, and c are vectors, then:
(a  b)  c  a  (b  c)
In the xy-plane. In two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, let
vector a be deﬁned by the coordinates (xa,ya), let vector b be

the coordinates (xc,yc). The associativity of vector addition fol-

tial functions.
Principles of Geometry
The fundamental rules of geometry are widely used in Newto-
nian (non-relativistic) physics and engineering.
Two point principle
Let P and Q be two distinct points. Then the following state-
ments hold true, as shown in Fig. 2.1:
 P and Q lie on a common line L
 L is the only line on which both points lie
Three point principle
Let P, Q, and R be three distinct points, not all of which lie on
a straight line. Then the following statements hold true:
 P, Q, and R all lie in a common Euclidean plane S
 S is the only Euclidean plane in which all three points lie

Midpoint principle.
Principle of n points
Let P1, P2, P3, . . . , and Pn be n distinct points, not all of which
lie in the same Euclidean space of n  1 dimensions. Then the
following statements hold true:
 P1, P2, P3, . . . , and Pn all lie in a common Euclidean space
U of n dimensions.
 U is the only n-dimensional Euclidean space in which all n
points lie.
Distance notation
The distance between any two points P and Q, as measured
from P towards Q along the straight line connecting them, is
symbolized by writing PQ.
Midpoint principle
Given a line segment connecting two points P and R, there ex-
ists one and only one point Q on the line segment, between P
and R, such that PQ  QR. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.2.
Angle notation
Let P, Q, and R be three distinct points. Let L be the line seg-
ment connecting P and Q; let M be the line segment connecting
R and Q. Then the smaller of the 2 angles angle  between L
and M, as measured at the vertex point Q in the plane deﬁned
by the three points, can be written either as ∠PQR or as ∠RQP.

and measurement.
If the rotational sense of measurement is speciﬁed, then ∠PQR
indicates the angle as measured from L to M, and ∠RQP indi-
cates the angle as measured from M to L (Fig. 2.3.) These no-
tations can also stand for the measures of angles in degrees or
radians.
Angle bisection
Given an angle ∠PQR measuring less than 180 degrees and
deﬁned by three points P, Q, and R, there exists exactly one ray
M that bisects ∠PQR. If S is any point on M and S  Q, then
the following statement is always true:
∠PQS  ∠SQR
That is, ray M is uniquely deﬁned by points Q and S. Every
angle has one and only one ray that bisects it. This is illustrated
in Fig. 2.4.
Perpendicularity
Let L be a line through points P and Q, and let R be a point
not on L. Then there exists one and only one perpendicular line
M through point R, intersecting line L at a point S, such that
the following holds (Fig. 2.5):
∠PSR  ∠QSR  90  /2 radians

there exists one and only one perpendicular line M that inter-

Parallel principle
Let L be a line; let P be a point not on L. Then there exists one
and only one line M through P, such that line M is parallel to
line L (Fig. 2.13). This is one of the most important postulates
in Euclidean geometry. Its negation can take two forms: either
there exists no such line M, or there exists more than one such
line M. Either form of the negation of this principle constitutes
a cornerstone of non-Euclidean geometry.
Mutual perpendicularity
Let L and M be coplanar lines (lines that lie in a common plane),
both of which intersect a third line N, and both of which are
perpendicular to line N. Then lines L and M are parallel (Fig.
2.14).

Then all four interior angles measure 90 degrees, and V is a

Circular Functions
There are six circular trigonometric functions. They operate on
angles to yield real numbers, and are known as sine, cosine,
tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent. In formulas and equa-
tions, they are abbreviated sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, and cot re-
spectively.
Basic circular functions
Consider a circle in rectangular coordinates with the following
equation:

140
Chapter Two
Figure 2.55
Unit-circle mo-
del for deﬁning circular trig-
onometric functions.
x2  y2  1
This is called the unit circle because its radius is one unit, and
it is centered at the origin (0,0), as shown in Fig. 2.55. Let  be
an angle whose apex is at the origin, and that is measured coun-
terclockwise from the abscissa (x axis). Suppose this angle cor-
responds to a ray that intersects the unit circle at some point
P  (x0, y0). Then
y0  sin 
x0 cos 
y0/x0  tan 
Secondary circular functions
Three more circular trigonometric functions are derived from
those deﬁned above. They are the cosecant function, the secant
function, and the cotangent function. In formulas and equations,
they are abbreviated csc , sec , and cot . They are deﬁned as
follows:
csc   1 / (sin )  1/y0
sec   1 / (cos )  1/x0
cot   1 / (tan )  x0/y0

Right-triangle model
Consider a right triangle PQR, such that ∠PQR is the right
angle. Let a be the length of line segment RQ, b be the length
of line segment QP, and c be the length of line segment RP as
shown in Fig. 2.56. Let  be the angle between line segments
RQ and RP. The six circular trigonometric functions can be de-
ﬁned as ratios between the lengths of the sides, as follows:
sin   b/c
cos   a/c
tan   b/a
csc   c/b
sec   c/a
cot   a/b
Circular functions as imaginary powers
of e
Let  be a real-number angle in radians. The values of the cir-
cular functions of  can be deﬁned in exponential terms as imag-
inary-number powers of e, where e is the natural logarithm base
and is equal to approximately 2.71828. The symbol j represents
the unit imaginary number, which is the positive square root of
1. As long as denominators are nonzero, the following equa-
tions hold:

Inverse circular functions
Each of the six circular trigonometric functions has an inverse.
These inverse relations operate on real numbers to yield angles,
and are known as arcsine, arccosine, arctangent, arccosecant,
arcsecant, and arccotangent. In formulas and equations, they
are abbreviated arcsin or sin1, arccos or cos1, arctan or tan1,
arccsc or csc1, arcsec or sec1, and arccot or cot1 respectively.
They are functions when their domains are restricted as shown

ties for the circular functions. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, these

ponential of x to the natural exponential of x is equal to the
exponential of x to the base 10/e:
10x/ex  (10/e)x  (3.6788)x
Let x be a nonzero real number. The ratio (quotient) of the com-
mon exponential of 1/x to the natural exponential of 1/x is equal
to the exponential of 1/x to the base 10/e:
(101/x)/(e1/x)  (10/e)1/x  (3.6788)1/x

Ratio of natural to common exponential
Let x be a real number. The ratio (quotient) of the natural ex-
ponential of x to the common exponential of x is equal to the
exponential of x to the base e/10:
ex/10x  (e/10)x  (0.271828)x
Let x be a nonzero real number. The ratio (quotient) of the nat-
ural exponential of 1/x to the common exponential of 1/x is
equal to the exponential of 1/x to the base e/10:
(e1/x)/(101/x)  (e/10)1/x  (0.271828)1/x
Common exponential of ratio
Let x and y be real numbers, with the restriction y  0. The
common exponential of the ratio (quotient) of x to y is equal to
the exponential of 1/y to the base 10x:
10x/y  (10x)1/y
Natural exponential of ratio
Let x and y be real numbers, with the restriction y  0. The
natural exponential of the ratio (quotient) of x to y is equal to
the exponential of 1/y to the base ex:
ex/y  (ex)1/y
Natural exponential of imaginary
number
Let jx be an imaginary number, where x is a non-negative real
number expressed as an angle in radians, with the restriction
that the angle be reduced to its simplest form, that is, 0  x 
2. (If x  2, a natural-number multiple of 2 can be sub-
tracted to obtain an equivalent value of x such that 0  x  2.
If x  0, a natural-number multiple of 2 can be added to obtain
an equivalent value of x such that 0  x  2.) The following
equations hold:
jx

Complex number in exponential form
Let c be a complex number a  jb, where a and b are real
numbers. Let r represent the length of the complex vector in
the complex-number plane, and x represent the angle of the
vector in radians counterclockwise from the abscissa (the posi-
tive real-number axis). Then the following equations hold:
r  (a2  b2)1/2
x  tan1 (b/a)
c  r cos x  j(r sin x)
(If x  2, a natural-number multiple of 2 can be subtracted
to obtain an equivalent value of x such that 0  x  2. If x 
0, a natural-number multiple of 2 can be added to obtain an
equivalent value of x such that 0  x  2.) The value of c can
be depicted as the natural exponential of an imaginary number:

This chapter outlines principles and formulas in scientiﬁc no-
tation, logic, sequences and series, differentiation, integration,
differential equations, and probability.
Scientiﬁc Notation
The term scientiﬁc notation refers to various methods of ex-
pressing numbers and variables, including the use of subscripts,
superscripts, and powers of 10.
Subscripts
Subscripts modify the meanings of units, constants, and varia-
bles. A subscript is placed to the right of the main character
(without spacing), is set in smaller type than the main charac-
ter, and is set below the base line. Numeric subscripts are not
italicized; alphabetic subscripts are sometimes italicized. Ex-
amples of subscripted quantities are:
Z0
read ‘‘Z sub nought’’;
stands for characteristic impedance
Rout
read ‘‘R sub out’’;
stands for output resistance
yn
read ‘‘y sub n’’;
represents a variable

190
Chapter Three
Superscripts
Superscripts represent exponents (the raising of a base quantity
to a power). Superscripts are usually numerals, but they are
sometimes alphabetic characters. Italicized, lowercase English
letters from the second half of the alphabet (n through z) are
generally used to represent variable exponents. A superscript is
placed to the right of the main character (without spacing), is
set in smaller type than the main character, and is set above
the base line. Examples of superscripted quantities are:
23
read ‘‘two cubed’’;
represents 2  2  2
ex
read ‘‘e to the xth’’;
represents the exponential function of x
y1/2
read ‘‘y to the one-half’’;
represents the square root of y
Power-of-10 notation
Extreme numerical values can be represented by an exponential
scheme known as power-of-10 notation. A numeral in this form
is written as follows:
z
m.n  10
where m (to the left of the radix point) is a number from the
set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, n (to the right of the radix point) is
a non-negative integer, and z (the power of 10) can be any in-
teger. Here are some examples of numbers written in this form:
6
2.56  10
18
8.0773  10
0
1.000  10
In some countries, power-of-10 notation requires that that m 
0. In this rarely-used form, the above numbers appear as:
7
0.256  10
17
0.80773  10
1
0.1000  10

Applied Mathematics, Calculus, and Differential Equations
191
The ‘‘times sign’’
The multiplication sign in a power-of-10 expression can be de-
noted in various ways. Instead of the common cross symbol (),
an asterisk (*) can be used, so the above expressions become:
6
2.56 * 10
18
8.0773 * 10
0
1.000 * 10
Another alternative is to use a small dot raised above the base
line (), so the expressions appear as:
6
2.56  10
18
8.0773  10
0
1.000  10
This small dot should not be confused with a radix point, as in
the expression:
z
m.n  10
in which the dot between m and n is a radix point and lies along
the base line, while the dot between n and 10z is a multiplica-
tion symbol and lies above the base line.
Plain-text exponents
Sometimes it is necessary to express numbers in power-of-10
notation using plain text. This is the case, for example, when
transmitting information within the body of an e-mail message
(rather than as an attachment). Some electronic calculators and
computers use this system. The uppercase letter E indicates
that the quantity immediately following is an exponent. In this
format, the above expressions are written as:
2.56E6
8.0773E18
1.000E0
Sometimes the exponent is always written with two numerals

192
Chapter Three
and always includes a plus sign or a minus sign, so the above
expressions appear as:
2.56E06
8.0773E18
1.000E00
Another alternative is to use an asterisk to indicate multipli-
cation, and the symbol  to indicate a superscript, so the ex-
pressions appear as:

2.56 * 10 6

8.0773 * 10 18

1.000 * 10 0
In all of these examples, the numerical values represented are
identical. Respectively, if written out in full, they are:
2,560,000
0.0000000000000000080773
1.000
Rules for use
In printed literature, it is common practice to use power-of-10
notation only when z (the power of 10) is fairly large or small.
If 2  z  2, numbers are written out in full as a rule, and
the power of 10 is not shown. If z  3 or z  3, numbers are
sometimes written out in full, and are sometimes depicted in
power-of-10 notation. If z  4 or z  4, values are expressed
in power-of-10 notation as a rule. Calculators set to display
quantities in power-of-10 notation usually do so for all numbers,
even those for which the power of 10 is zero.
Addition and subtraction of numbers is best done by writing
numbers out in full, if possible. Thus, for example:
(3.045  102)  (6.853  103)
 304.5  6853  7157.5
 7.1575  103

Applied Mathematics, Calculus, and Differential Equations
193
When numbers are multiplied or divided in power-of-10 no-
tation, the decimal numbers (to the left of the multiplication
symbol) are multiplied or divided by each other. Then the pow-
ers of 10 are added (for multiplication) or subtracted (for divi-
sion). Finally, the product or quotient is reduced to standard
form. An example is:
(3.045  102)(6.853  103)
 20.867385  105  2.0867385  106
Truncation
The process of truncation deletes all the numerals to the right
of a certain point in the decimal part of an expression. Some
electronic calculators use this process to ﬁt numbers within
their displays. For example, the number 3.830175692803 can be
shortened in steps as follows:
3.830175692803
3.83017569280
3.8301756928
3.830175692
3.83017569
3.8301756
3.830175
3.83017
3.8301
3.830
3.83
3.8

Rounding
Rounding is a more accurate, and preferred, method of render-
ing numbers in shortened form. In this process, when a given
digit (call it r) is deleted at the right-hand extreme of an ex-
pression, the digit q to its left (which becomes the new r after
the old r is deleted) is not changed if 0  r  4. If 5  r  9,
then q is increased by 1 (‘‘rounded up’’). Some electronic calcu-

194
Chapter Three
lators use rounding rather than truncation. If rounding is used,
the number 3.830175692803 can be shortened in steps as fol-
lows:
3.830175692803
3.83017569280
3.8301756928
3.830175693
3.83017569
3.8301757
3.830176
3.83018
3.8302

Signiﬁcant ﬁgures
When calculations are performed using power-of-10 notation,
the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in the result cannot be greater
than the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in the shortest expression
in the calculation.
In the foregoing example showing addition, the sum, 7.1575
 103, must be cut down to four signiﬁcant ﬁgures because the
addends have only four signiﬁcant ﬁgures. If the resultant is
truncated, it becomes 7.157  103. If rounded, it becomes 7.158
 103.
In the foregoing example showing multiplication, the resul-
tant, 2.0867385  106, must be cut down to four signiﬁcant ﬁg-
ures because the multiplicands have only four signiﬁcant ﬁg-
ures. If the resultant is truncated, it becomes 2.086  106. If
rounded, it becomes 2.087  106.

‘‘Downsizing’’ of resultants is best done at the termination of
a calculation process, if that process involves more than one
computation.
Boolean Algebra
Boolean algebra is a simple system of mathematical logic using
the numbers 0 and 1. These logic states are also called low and
high, respectively. There are three fundamental operations: ne-
gation, multiplication, and addition. Boolean operations behave
differently than their counterparts in conventional real-number
and complex-number algebra.
Negation
Let X be a logical quantity, also known as a Boolean variable.
The negation of X is written as X, X, or X with a line over it.
In the following paragraphs, the dash () is used to represent
Boolean negation. The following rules apply:
If X  0, then X  1
If X  1, then X  0
Multiplication
Let X and Y be Boolean variables. The Boolean product can be
written in any of these ways:
XY
X  Y
X  Y
X * Y
In the following paragraphs, the  symbol is used. The follow-
ing rules apply:

196
Chapter Three
If X  0 and Y  0, then X  Y  0
If X  0 and Y  1, then X  Y  0
If X  1 and Y  0, then X  Y  0
If X  1 and Y  1, then X  Y  1
Addition
Let X and Y be Boolean variables. The Boolean sum is written
X  Y. The following rules apply:
If X  0 and Y  0, then X  Y  0
If X  0 and Y  1, then X  Y  1
If X  1 and Y  0, then X  Y  1
If X  1 and Y  1, then X  Y  1
Even-multiple negation
The negation of any logical quantity X, carried out an even
number of times, is always equal to X. The following equations
hold:
(X)  X
(((X)))  X
(((((X)))))  X
etc.
Odd-multiple negation
The negation of any logical quantity X, carried out an odd num-
ber of times, is always equal to X. The following equations
hold:
((X))  X
((((X))))  X
((((((X))))))  X
etc.

Additive identity
The sum of 0 and any logical quantity X is always equal to X.
Therefore, 0 is known as the additive identity element. The fol-
lowing Boolean equations hold:
X  0  X
0  X  X
Addition of 1
The sum of 1 and any logical quantity X is always equal to 1.
The following Boolean equations hold:
X  1  1
1  X  1
Addition of identical quantities
When any logical quantity X is added to itself, the result is
equal to X. The following Boolean equation holds:
X  X  X
Addition of opposites
The sum of any logical quantity X and its negative is always
equal to 1. The following Boolean equations hold:
X  (X)  1
X  X  1
Commutativity of addition
The order in which a sum is performed does not matter. For any
two logical quantities X and Y, the following Boolean equation
holds:
X  Y  Y  X

198
Chapter Three
Associativity of addition
The manner in which a sum is grouped does not matter. For any
three logical quantities X, Y, and Z, the following Boolean equa-
tion holds:
(X  Y)  Z  X  (Y  Z)
Negation of a sum
The negation of the sum of two quantities is equal to the product
of the negations of the individual quantities. This is also known
as DeMorgan’s rule for addition. For any two logical quantities
X and Y, the following Boolean equation holds:
(X  Y)  (X)  (Y)
Multiplicative identity
The product of 1 and any logical quantity X is always equal to
X. Therefore, 1 is known as the Boolean multiplicative identity
element. The following Boolean equations hold:
X  1  X
1  X  X
Multiplication by zero
The product of 0 and any logical quantity X is always equal to
0. The following Boolean equations hold:
X  0  0
0  X  0
Multiplication of identical quantities
When any logical quantity X is multiplied by itself, the result
is equal to X. The following Boolean equation holds:
X  X  X

Applied Mathematics, Calculus, and Differential Equations
199
Multiplication of opposites
The product of any logical quantity X and its negative is always
equal to 0. The following Boolean equations hold:
X  (X)  0
X  X  0
Commutativity of multiplication
The order in which a product is performed does not matter. For
any two logical quantities X and Y, the following Boolean equa-
tion holds:
X  Y  Y  X
Associativity of multiplication
The manner in which a product is grouped does not matter. For
any three logical quantities X, Y, and Z, the following Boolean
equation holds:
(X  Y)  Z  X  (Y  Z)
Negation of a product
The negation of the product of two quantities is equal to the
sum of the negations of the individual quantities. This is also
known as DeMorgan’s rule for multiplication. For any two log-
ical quantities X and Y, the following Boolean equation holds:
(X  Y)  (X)  (Y)
Distributivity
Boolean multiplication distributes over Boolean addition. For
any three logical quantities X, Y, and Z, the following equation
holds:
X  (Y  Z)  (X  Y)  (X  Z)

Propositional Logic
Propositional logic, also known as propositional calculus, sen-
tential logic, or sentential calculus, is similar to Boolean algebra
but involves more operations. Propositions or sentences are
symbolized by letters from the middle of the alphabet, such as
P, Q, R, and S. Logic values are T (true) and F (false). Standard
operations and relations are negation, conjunction, disjunction,
implication, and equivalence.
Negation
Logical negation is also known as the NOT operation. Let P be
a proposition. The negation of P is written as ¬P or P. In the
following paragraphs, the tilde () is used. See Table 3.1 for
logic values.
Conjunction
Logical conjunction is also known as the AND operation. Let P
and Q be propositions. The conjunction of P and Q is written
P  Q. See Table 3.1 for logic values.

Applied Mathematics, Calculus, and Differential Equations
201
Disjunction
Logical disjunction is also known as the OR operation. Let P
and Q be propositions. The disjunction of P and Q is written
P  Q. See Table 3.1 for logic values.
Implication
Logical implication is also known as if-then. Let P and Q be
propositions. The statement ‘‘If P, then Q,’’ also read as ‘‘P im-
plies Q,’’ is written P →Q. (The arrow symbol is not to be con-
fused with the identical symbol denoting the fact that the value
of a sequence or series approaches a constant.) See Table 3.1 for
logic values.
Equivalence
Logical equivalence is also know as if-and-only-if or iff. Let P
and Q be propositions. The statement ‘‘P if and only if Q’’ is
written P ↔Q. See Table 3.1 for logic values.
Even-multiple negation
The negation of any proposition P, carried out an even number
of times, is logically equivalent to the original proposition P. The
following statements are valid:
(P) ↔P
(((P))) ↔P
(((((P))))) ↔P
etc.
Odd-multiple negation
The negation of any proposition P, carried out an odd number
of times, is logically equivalent to P. The following statements
are valid:
((P)) ↔P
((((P)))) ↔P
((((((P)))))) ↔P
etc.

Excluded middle
The disjunction of any proposition P and its negative is a logi-
cally valid statement. That is:

The order in which a disjunction is stated does not matter. For
any two propositions P and Q, the following statement is valid:
P  Q ↔Q  P
Associativity of disjunction
The manner in which a disjunction is grouped does not matter.
For any three propositions P, Q, and R, the following statement
is valid:
(P  Q)  R ↔P  (Q  R)
DeMorgan’s law for disjunction
The negation of the disjunction of two propositions is equal to
the conjunction of the negations of the propositions. For any two
propositions P and Q, the following statement is valid:
(P  Q) ↔(P)  (Q)

Proof by cases
For any two propositions P and Q, if P implies Q and the ne-
gation of P implies Q, then Q is true. The following logical state-
ment is valid:

For any proposition P, if P and P are simultaneously true, then
anything follows. The following statement is valid:
(P  P) →Q

For any two propositions P and Q, if P implies Q, then Q im-
plies P. Also, if Q implies P, then P implies Q. The follow-
ing statement is valid:

Transitivity of implication
For any three propositions P, Q, and R, if P implies Q and Q
implies R, then P implies R. The following statement is valid:
((P →Q)  (Q →R)) →(P →R)
Transitivity of equivalence
For any three propositions P, Q, and R, if P is logically equiva-
lent to Q and Q is logically equivalent to R, then P is logically

and series commonly encountered in engineering and science.

Positive inﬁnite sequence
A positive inﬁnite sequence is an inﬁnite sequence, all of whose

Negative inﬁnite sequence
A negative inﬁnite sequence is an inﬁnite sequence, all of whose
terms are real numbers less than zero.
Alternating inﬁnite sequence

Nonincreasing inﬁnite sequence
A nonincreasing inﬁnite sequence is a sequence such that, for
every n  N, the deﬁning function f has the following property:
f(n  1)  f(n)
Convergent inﬁnite sequence
A convergent inﬁnite sequence is a sequence in which the value
of the deﬁning function f approaches a speciﬁc real number s as
n increases without bound:
f(n) →s as n →	
(The arrow symbol is not to be confused with the identical sym-

Suppose A  f(n) is a convergent sequence such that the follow-
ing statements are both valid:
f(n) →s as n →

(The arrow symbol is not to be confused with the identical sym-

tities.

variable x. The antiderivative or indeﬁnite integral of f is a func-
tion F such that dF/dx  f. This is written as follows:

in the line (in amperes). Points at which Imax and Imin occur are
separated by
1⁄4 electrical wavelength. Current maxima nor-
mally exist at the same points on a transmission line as voltage

Relation among SWR, VSWR, and ISWR
In theory, assuming zero loss in a transmission line, the follow-
ing equation holds:
SWR  VSWR  ISWR
In practice, when a line has signiﬁcant loss, these quantities
differ slightly depending on the points where current and volt-
age are measured. In transmitting antenna systems, the ratios
are lower toward the equipment (transmitter) end of the line,
and higher toward the antenna (load) end.
Reﬂection coefﬁcient vs SWR
Let s represent the SWR, VSWR, or ISWR measured at the an-
tenna (load) end of a transmitting RF transmission line. Then
the reﬂection coefﬁcient, k, is given by:

Reﬂection coefﬁcient vs load
resistance
Suppose an RF transmission line is terminated in a load whose
impedance (in ohms) is a pure resistance, Rload. Let Z0 represent
the characteristic impedance of the line (in ohms). Then the

is insigniﬁcant in practical terms unless the SWR is more than
2:1. In severely mismatched, long lines at high frequencies, the
SWR loss can be considerable.

Units
The Standard International (SI) System of Units, formerly
called the Meter/Kilogram/Second (MKS) System, consists of
seven fundamental quantities in nature. These are the ﬁrst
seven units deﬁned below. Most other units are derived from
these.
Displacement
One meter (1 m) is equivalent to 1.65076373  106 wavelengths
in a vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition
between the two levels of the krypton-86 atom. It was originally
deﬁned as 107 of the distance from the North Geographic Pole
to the equator as measured over the surface of the earth at the
Greenwich Meridian. Displacement is represented in equations
by the italicized lowercase letters d or s.
Mass
One kilogram (1 kg) is the mass of 1000 cubic centimeters (1.000
 103 cm3), or one liter, of pure liquid water at the temperature

350
Chapter Five
of its greatest density (approximately 281 degrees Kelvin). Mass
is represented by the italicized lowercase letter m.
Time
One second (1 s) is 1/86,400  1.1574  105 part of a solar
day. It is also deﬁned as the time required for a beam of visible
light to propagate over a distance of 2.99792  108 m in a vac-
uum. Time is represented in equations by the italicized lower-
case letter t.

between absolute zero (the absence of all heat) and the freezing
point of pure water at standard atmospheric temperature and
pressure. Temperature is represented in equations by the ital-
icized uppercase letter T, and occasionally by the italicized low-
ercase letter t.
Electric current

sured on the circle, is equal to the radius of the circle. Angles
are represented in equations by italicized lowercase Greek let-
ters, usually 	 (phi) or  (theta).
Solid angular measure

A solid angle of 1 sr is represented by a cone with its apex at
the center of a sphere, intersecting the surface of the sphere in
a circle such that, within the circle, the enclosed area on the
sphere is equal to the square of the radius of the sphere. Solid
angles are represented in equations by italicized lowercase
Greek letters, usually 	 (phi) or  (theta).
Velocity
The standard unit of linear speed is the meter per second
(m/s). The unit of velocity requires two speciﬁcations: speed and
direction. Direction is indicated in radians clockwise from geo-
graphic north on the earth’s surface, and counterclockwise from
the positive x axis in the coordinate xy-plane. In three dimen-
sions, direction can be speciﬁed in rectangular, spherical, or cy-
lindrical coordinates. Speed and velocity are represented in
equations by the italicized lowercase letter v, and sometimes by
the italicized lowercase letters u or w.

(rad/s). Angular velocity is represented in equations by the ital-
icized lowercase Greek letter  (omega).

second (m/s/s) or meter per second squared (m/s2). Linear ac-
celeration is represented in equations by the italicized lower-
case letter a.

ond per second (rad/s/s) or radian per second squared (rad/s2).

it is expressed in terms of unit mass multiplied by unit distance
squared per unit time squared:
2

1 J  1 kg  m /s
Energy is represented in equations by the italicized uppercase
letter E. Occasionally it is represented by the italicized upper-
case H, T, or V.
Electromotive force
The standard unit of electromotive force (EMF), also called elec-
tric potential or potential difference, is the volt (V). It is equiv-
alent to 1 J/C. Electromotive force is represented in equations
by the italicized uppercase letters E or V.
Resistance
The standard unit of resistance is the ohm (). It is the resis-
tance that results in 1 A of electric current with an applied EMF
of 1 V. Resistance is represented in equations by the italicized
uppercase letter R, and occasionally by the italicized lowercase
letter r.
Resistivity
The standard unit of resistivity is the ohm-meter (  m). If a
length of material measuring 1 m carries 1 A of current when
a potential difference of 1 V is applied, then it has a resistivity
of 1   m. Resistivity is represented in equations by the itali-
cized lowercase Greek letter  (rho).
Conductance
The standard unit of conductance is the siemens (S), formerly
called the mho. Mathematically, conductance is the reciprocal
of resistance. Conductance is represented in equations by the
italicized uppercase letter G. If R is the resistance of a compo-

354
Chapter Five
nent in ohms, and G is the conductance of the component in
siemens, then
G  1/R
R  1/G
Conductivity
The standard unit of conductivity is the siemens per meter
(S/m). If a length of material measuring 1 m carries 1 A of
current when a potential difference of 1 V is applied, then it
has a conductivity of 1 S/m. Conductivity is represented in
equations by the italicized lowercase Greek letter  (sigma).
Power
The standard unit of power is the watt (W), equivalent to 1
J/s. Power is represented in equations by the italicized upper-
case letters P or W. In electrical and electronic circuits contain-
ing no reactance, if P is the power in watts, V is the voltage in
volts, I is the current in amperes, and R is the resistance in
ohms, then the following holds:
2
2
P  VI  I R  V /R
Period
The standard unit of alternating-current (AC) cycle period is the
second (s). This is a large unit in practice; typical signals have
periods on the order of thousandths, millionths, billionths, or
trillionths of a second. Period is represented in equations by the
italicized uppercase letter T.
Frequency
The standard unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz), formerly called
the cycle per second (cps). This is a small unit in practice; typical
signals have frequencies on the order of thousands, millions,
billions, or trillions of hertz. Frequency, which is the mathe-
matical reciprocal of period, is represented in equations by the

Physical and Chemical Data
355
italicized lowercase letter f. If T is the period of a wave distur-
bance in seconds, then the frequency f in hertz is given by:
f  1/T
Capacitance
The standard unit of capacitance is the farad (F), which is equal
to 1 C/V. This is a large unit in practice. In electronic circuits,
most values of capacitance are on the order of millionths, bil-
lionths, or trillionths of a farad. Capacitance is represented in
equations by the italicized uppercase letter C.
Inductance
The standard unit of inductance is the henry (H), which is equal
to 1 V  s/A. This is a large unit in practice. In electronic circuits,
most values of inductance are on the order of thousandths or
millionths of a henry. Inductance is represented in equations by
the italicized uppercase letter L.
Reactance
The standard unit of reactance is the ohm (). Reactance is
represented in equations by the italicized uppercase letter X. It
can be positive (inductive) and symbolized by XL, or negative
(capacitive) and symbolized by XC. Reactance is dependent on
frequency. Let f represent frequency in hertz, L represent in-
ductance in henrys, and C represent capacitance in farads. Then
the following formulas hold:
X  2fL
L
X
 1/(2fC)
C
Complex impedance
In the determination of complex impedance, there are two com-
ponents: resistance (R) and reactance (X). The reactive compo-
nent is multiplied by the unit imaginary number known as the
j operator. Mathematically, j is equal to the positive square root
of 1, so the following formulas hold:

356

j  j  j  1  j  j

j  j  j  j  j  1
For powers of j beyond 4, the cycle repeats, so in general, for
integers n  4:
n
(n4)
j
 j
Let Z represent complex impedance, R represent resistance, and
X represent reactance (either inductive or capacitive). Then:
Z  R  jX
Absolute-value impedance
Complex impedance can be represented as a vector in a rectan-
gular coordinate plane, where resistance is plotted on the ab-
scissa (horizontal axis) and reactance is plotted on the ordinate
(vertical axis). The length of this vector is called the absolute-
value impedance, symbolized by the italicized uppercase letter
Z and expressed in ohms. This impedance is usually discussed
only when jX  0, that is, when the impedance is a pure resis-
tance (Z  R). In the broad sense, if Z is the absolute-value
impedance, then
2
2 1/2
Z  (R  X )
There are, in theory, inﬁnitely many combinations of R and X
that can result in a given absolute-value impedance Z.
Electric ﬁeld strength
The standard unit of electric ﬁeld strength is the volt per meter
(V/m). An electric ﬁeld of 1 V/m is represented by a potential
difference of 1 V existing between two points displaced by 1 m.
Electric ﬁeld strength is represented in equations by the itali-
cized uppercase letter E.

Physical and Chemical Data
357
Electromagnetic ﬁeld strength
The standard unit of electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld strength is the
watt per square meter (W/m2). An EM ﬁeld of 1 W/m2 is rep-

Newton’s First Law
This law consists of two parts:
 A mass at rest will remain at rest unless acted on by an out-
side force
 A mass in motion will continue to move with constant velocity
unless acted on by an outside force.

Consider an object of mass m (in kilograms). Suppose this mass
is acted upon by a constant outside force F (in newtons). The
object will experience a constant acceleration a (in meters per
second squared) equal to the ratio of the force to the mass:

The foregoing can be more generally stated by considering the
force as a vector F (in newtons in a speciﬁc direction) and the
acceleration as a vector a (representing a change in the velocity
vector v):

Suppose a non-compressible ﬂuid C passes along a pipe. Let s1
be the speed of C relative to the pipe (in meters per second) at
some point P1 along the length of the pipe; let A1 be the cross-

That is, the ﬂow rate (denoted J and expressed in meters cubed

Second Law of Thermodynamics
This law can be stated in three parts.
 Let M1 and M2 be objects having absolute temperatures T1
and T2. If T1  T2, then heat energy can spontaneously ﬂow
from T1 to T2, but not from T2 to T1. If T1  T2, then heat
energy can spontaneously ﬂow from T2 to T1, but not from T1
to T2.
 The efﬁciency of a continuously cycling heat engine is always
less than 100 percent. Let E represent the heat energy input
to the engine; let Ew represent the useful work energy output.
Then Ew  E.
 When a system changes spontaneously, its entropy cannot de-
crease.
A corollary to this law is the fact that if there are several
different ways in which a system can exist, the most probable
state is the state in which the entropy is greatest, and the least
probable state is the state in which the entropy is smallest.

a medium having a relatively higher refractive index to a me-
dium having a relatively lower refractive index. Let N be a line
passing through some point P on B, such that N is normal to B
at P. Let R1 be a ray of some electromagnetic disturbance D,
traveling through M1, that strikes B at P. Let 1 be the angle
(in radians) that R1 subtends relative to N at P. Let R2 be the
ray of D that emerges from P into M2. Let 2 be the angle (in
radians) that R2 subtends relative to N at P. Then line N, ray
R1, and ray R2 lie in a common plane, and 2  1. (The two
angles are equal if and only if both measure zero; that is, if and
only if R1 coincides with N.) Snell’s law holds in this case, just
as in the situation described previously:

Consider the situation depicted by Fig. 5.9. As 1 increases,
2 →/2. In the case where n2  n1, 2  /2 for some 1 

which 2  /2. When c  1  /2, B behaves as a reﬂective
surface, and R1 obeys the rule for reﬂection from a ﬂat surface.
The value of c (in radians) is equal to the arcsine of the ratio

If s1  f, then s2 becomes negative; the light from X1 will

The diopter of a convex lens (also called magnifying or converg-

From this formula, the analogous formula for focal length can

Let L represent the line of the direct beam, normal to B and

observer Z. Suppose X moves at constant speed vX relative to Z;
suppose Y moves at constant speed vY (in the same units as vX)
relative to X, in the same direction that X moves relative to Z.

carries a precision clock KX that Z can constantly monitor. Sup-

dilation
The formula in the preceding paragraph applies equally well
when X and Z (the observer’s and the object’s reference frames)
are transposed, even if all other considerations remain unchan-
ged. This gives rise to the so-called twin paradox, in which clock
KX lags clock KZ from the reference frame of Z, and KZ lags KX
from the reference frame of X. This absurdity is overcome in the
general theory of relativity, in which time dilation is considered
to result from acceleration or the presence of a gravitational
ﬁeld, rather than from relative motion.
Relativistic spatial contraction

locity v (in meters per second) along a line L relative to an ob-

meters per second in a speciﬁed direction) along a line L relative
to an observer Z. Suppose X has mass m (in kilograms) at rest.
Let c be the speed of light in a vacuum (in meters per second).

Radioactive decay
Radioactive decay is measured in terms of half life, denoted t
and expressed in time units that depend on the speed with
which the substance in question decays (seconds, minutes,
hours, days, or years). The half life is the length of time, as
measured from a deﬁned starting point t0, after which exactly
half (50 percent) of the radioactive atoms in the sample are
unaltered. Half life is independent of t0.
Suppose a radioactive sample has a half life of t time units.
Suppose the substance is tested for radioactivity at a speciﬁc
time, and then is tested again x time units later. The proportion
of radioactive atoms P% that are unaltered after the passage of

232.038. Classiﬁed as a rare earth, and a member of the acti-
nide series. In pure form it is silver-colored, soft, ductile, and
malleable. It is fairly stable in air, but gradually darkens. The
naturally-occurring isotope is radioactive, emitting alpha par-
ticles, and has an extremely long half-life, on the order of sev-
eral billion years. Some isotopes are used in specialized alloys
and compounds, in the manufacture of photoelectric cells, and
to coat the tungsten in electron-tube and incandescent-lamp ﬁl-
aments. When heated sufﬁciently, thorium burns with a bril-
liant white light. This element is fairly abundant in nature, ex-
isting in thorite and monazite ores. It holds promise as a source
of nuclear energy for the future. The energy released by the
radioactive decay of thorium and uranium is believed to be re-
sponsible for much of the internal heating of the earth.
